0,I’m not trying to be a freak or anything but I want to cum. I look at porn videos and I think that’s hot I am sitting here trying to play with myself but it doesn’t feel good. I want it to feel good but it doesn’t. Why is that? I can’t even make myself feel good is there something wrong with me?  I can’t even pleasure myself ho do I expect to pleasure someone else.,23Dec2019,1
3,"It’s very good. 

At first bite I dry heaved about 3 times while I was chewing it. The first ever piece of sweet potato. 

After 4 or 5 pieces, it was very delicious and sweet and soft. Since I boiled the sweet potato.

I guess I dry heaved because of the vomit like texture. Moist and warm. 

I think I’ll replace regular potatoes from now on lol!!",23Dec2019,1
4," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ on email replies and said it in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. Sometimes she will ask me something related to jobs etc then when is she whatever is ya she will abruptly reply ‘did yer’ in what seems a snotty/sarcastic way 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence : /",23Dec2019,1
5,"Alright, so I’ve had 26 years with myself, and I’ve come to the conclusion that I would be totally okay with kissing another guy, or holding his hand.. but that’s it. Like, an asexual relationship (meaning a sexless relationship). I don’t have that biblical mentality that men should be with women, and women only. I see people for what they are, human beings, and my attraction to you is because I find you to be an incredible person BUT I’ve been sexually intimate with women my whole life, and I know that the arousal that I get from being with a woman will only ever be with a woman. I just don’t feel THAT way about men. I can be affectionate with a man, and could see myself spending my life with a man, just without the sexual aspect. Does anyone else feel this way?",23Dec2019,1

I’d rather save my attention and energy into doing something I enjoy. Making dinner with my boyfriend, snuggling on the couch, watching something funny. Now we get to pet a cat too!

13,"Seriously. The more people gush over children and act like they're so cute and special, the more I grow to despise the little bastards. I don't find them cute AT ALL. Kittens and puppies are cute, not human young. Human children (girls in particular, and I say this as a female) are spoiled cunts, many of whom should have their hair tugged by the roots. They think that just by being cute, petite, and blond they can get audiences to fawn over them, people to feel sorry for them. The blonder and more delicate looking a girl is, the more I want to punch her face in. 

I especially hate how celebrities fawn over them. Go to any concert and you'll see it's the KIDS that are getting called up on stage the most! The KIDS are the ones that elicit the most ""awwwww"" from the crowd. And it makes me fucking livid. KIDS ARE NOT SPECIAL!!! They should be thrown to the wolves like the rest of adult society is. Call me a monster (BOO HOO, I don't care!), but I absolutely refuse to ""go soft"" on kids. If a kid is whining and crying, I'd tell them to shut the fuck up, just like I would an adult who was bothering me. These brats don't deserve the special treatment they get.",23Dec2019,1

I see hallucinations frequently.. just randomly. I always hear whispers, and footsteps.. it’s always like i am being followed.

21,"Ever since my parents died from a drug overdose six years ago, I've been living with my grandmother, not only so I'd have a place to live, but also to help her out as much as I can. As soon as I finish college, I plan on joining the Marine Corps. I've already filled out all the paperwork and have officially enlisted, I judt don't yet have a date on which I'll be shipping out to boot camp. At any rate, my grandmother fell last week and is in the hospital. The doctors don't think she'll recover. She's fallen before and was fine, but it seems like this time, she won't be coming back home. 

I've taken a leave from work while I spend time with her and help her get her affairs in order, which means that I haven't been working or making any money. I work part time while I go to college, so I don't make much money as it is. I was wondering if anyone knows of any assistance programs or any ways of *quickly* procuring a very short-term loan. I just need at minimum $120 for groceries and other necessities until I can get back to work. I don't have any credit, so a loan from the bank is out of the question. Nor do I have any collateral or things to pawn. Although I'm NOT asking for handouts, someone suggested that I link to my Venmo and PayPal accounts, so here they are: https://venmo.com/code?user_id=2804862433624064381 

paypal.me/JBotts3D 

I'm so incredibly grateful for everyone's help. I wasn't expecting donations. I've received twenty dollars so far, which is already a huge help! 

So back to my question: how can I quickly come up with $120 to get by until I return to work? I'd be happy to work out a short term loan with interest, but I can't post on r/borrow due to my account not meeting the karma requirements. I *sincerely* appreciate any and all help. This is turning out to be an incredibly shitty Christmas, as I'm about to lose my last remaining family member. I don't know how I'm going to get through this. My mind is starting to go to some *very* dark places.      
       
Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read this. Merry Christmas to you all, and God bless every one of you.",23Dec2019,1
22,"It is wierd, or I am according to others. I have always been quiet and introverted around strangers, into arts and sciences, but generally lazy and careless. 

That's the the thing, careless. I can sympathize with people and sometimes wish I could help, and can get upset. But even then, I'm usually inexplicably happy. I like smiling. I like laughing (at stupid stuff) and sometimes at inappropriate times/places. I am childish but also mature, it is hard to explain. I have also become more forgiving, compared to the vengeful brat I once was, I am now more eager to let things slide. It is actually hard to get mad or be sad sometimes. Sometimes I feel if things just ""are"" and take a neutral approach to them. It is wierd, I suddenly view the world more holistically and many concepts make a lot more sense. I am dont want to die, and am by no means suicidal, but I am not afraid to die should it happen. The only thing I truly fear is pain, but even then, I'm usually very lax with it because I'm clumsy from time to time. I like life, even if it has its problems, it feels good. I feel like a lot of things don't matter, but I don't feel empty. I do sometimes feel; ""there is no point"" but I dont feel that state in which you have no emotions and nothing matters anymore, I now just feel; "" O well, there is nothing to worry about anyway"". There is no such thing as darkness to fear, it is like daytime, only without the warmth (its winter brrrrrr) and the light. Life feels good and easy, and while I do have my share of problems, I'm not worried, literally as if I know they are solved. I like doing my hobbies and like exploring the what the world has to offer. 

I like this alot save for something. I sometimes do feel alienated and do get lonely from time to time. I dont usually feel lonely, but when I see people bonding over a common ground that I dont share, I start to feel it. My friends are few but close. It sometimes feels like I have to be an outcast, sometimes I take some sort of pride, and a few times it hurts. But usually, it I just ""whatever"" it and continue. It almost feels as if I am making a journey for some sort of big prize and I like the feeling of purpose and fulfillment to say the least.

24,"Today would mark the one year anniversary of me not having to stay in the hospital at ALL for a year. Six years ago I was diagnosed with a chronic illness and have had frequent ER visits and hospital stays since then, not managing to make it more than a month at one point, but I made it a whole entire year! No one in my life will celebrate it with me, or thinks it’s that important. Most everyone thinks I should just be better by now.

he moved on so quickly. i don’t see how people can do that. i try to tell myself he just doesn’t want to be lonely but i’m just lying to myself. i met a guy recently and hung out with him and it was really fun, but i don’t think i’m ready for anything. i barely text him back anyways. i don’t really text anyone back. i think he’s great but i feel like i’m going to ruin everything with how sad i am. i know i can’t do a relationship at all. i don’t feel like putting up with other people atm.

29,"I joined the military when I was 17. I was reeled in with the promise of brotherhood and the adventure of a lifetime. I believed it for a while, but I left because I never found that. Instead, I was overworked, overlooked, and expected to always agree with everything my superiors did. I never complained at the time. It was part of being in the military, right? This was part of the experience... right? 

I handled that treatment for so long that I didn’t realize the residual effect that it had on me outside of it. I was more often angrier, frustrated, and stressed out at home because of what I was going through. In the end, I elected to leave the service. 

But, the cold and harsh reality is that on the outside, nobody gives a fuck about anyone who’s served. Some of you reading this might not give a fuck... and that’s alright. I’m not looking for recognition. I’m not looking for any of that. I don’t deserve an ounce of it. 

I just... I want to stop feeling like I have a dark black cloud over my head. I hate it. I can’t relate to anyone on the outside anymore. I try to make friends with the other students in my courses at the college, but they’re always friends of convenience. They stick around for a semester and then leave. Pretend they never knew you.

30,"30 minutes to be exact. Matched with a gal, we briefly chatted then met up for tea. She was late for our tea date by 10-15 minutes. A few days later, she asked me to lunch out of the blue. 

I showed up on time at 12:30. Waited at the reception area for 15 minutes before I texted her. She called me with some excuse about debit cards/ID whatever... said she was 5 minutes away.

So I went outside and sat on a bench to wait. 15 minutes later, I'm certain this girl is just fucking with me and isnt gonna show. As I was about to leave, I saw her turn the corner of the building in a *full fucking sprint.* She didnt even see me at first, and just bolted it to the front door. When she stopped, she noticed me watching her and immediately blushed.

36,"so im experiencing several things and have been experiencing these for the past few years. i dont tell anybody about them because i dont wanna come off like an emo dramatic person so i just keep quiet. here are the list of things i have to deal with everyday  


Hiding In The Bathroom - sometimes, out of nowhere, ill just feel an extreme dread and the only solution is just hiding in the bathroom. its a small enclosed space with a soothing color palette. ill stay there for hours at a time just staring at nothing. the dread i feel is either a coming event, a certain thing from my past that i remember, or ill just feel scared having my back to the rest of my room.   


""Angry Daydreaming"" - Odd name, but it just means ill be doing something but out of nowhere ill just pause and stare at nothing, and have thoughts of beating people up that pissed me off in the past, and usually these thought sequences end in me jumping in front of a car or shooting myself because im so pissed.

&amp;#x200B;

Checking The Basement - before i go to bed i just stare at the basement door thinking somebody broke in through the basement windows. finally after about 10 minutes ill be sure theres nobody there and ill go back to bed

&amp;#x200B;

Praying I Don't Wake Up - before i go to sleep i pray that i dont wake up because my life is incredibly boring and i feel like its going to remain this way for the rest of my life. everyday is literally the exact same and that sux ass.

&amp;#x200B;

Wanting To Do Something Drastic - ill constantly feel the urge to do something drastic like jumping out a car or smash my phone until it breaks. pretty basic out of all of them.

37,"I hate Christmas. It’s a reminders of how broken my family is. At a time when family should be together, mine is scattered; traveling over Christmas to maximize holiday time. Not that it makes a difference, we don’t get along most of the time anyways. I see other people and they have these big family’s come together and have these loving and sentimental christmases and I look at my family and I wonder how I ended up in a life so devoid of any physical or emotional affection. 

The one thing I crave so badly is to feel like I matter to someone. I matter to my son but he’s dependent on me and that’s a different feeling altogether, like excitement and anxiety all rolled into one. I feel like I’m a good husband; I do the lions share of the chores, I tend the outside of the house and shovel the snow, I keep the cars maintained, I cook, I do bedtime, I’m the primary bath giver, I do pick up and drop off from day care. I’m super attracted to my wife and love her to death and tell her/show her this all the time. And I feel like I’m an actor playing her husband. I’m allowed to be here and experience everything but my opinion doesn’t matter, I have to stick to the script or she gets mad and I definitely don’t get any real affection, just the fake “I need you to do something for me” affection. It’s so predictable that it hurts at this point. 

Basically at a time of year when we have some time off to be with family, I’m reminded of how much I’d rather be at work thank having this shit run through my head while everyone pretends that this isn’t painful as fuck.

46,"After 18 years this is our last Christmas together. I am cherishing every moment. This is the last time we wrap our kids gifts together, the last time we plan our Christmas as a the family we are now. We will split amicably and quietly. There will be no drama or craziness. We both want what is best for our kids so we will move forward with that thought. No one will be hurt more than they should. This will be peaceful because of who we are . My heart is breaking into a million pieces. I always thought love would be enough to keep us together. We are just too different and it doesn’t work anymore. 
I’m a plain Jane kinda girl. There is nothing about me that makes me special or exceptional. I do everything well enough but I am not good at anything in particular. I’m a bookworm, I dress for comfort and convenience. You wouldn’t be able to find me in a crowd. I’m ok with that. I’m a happy person. I am ok with just being ok. I don’t feel the need to set myself apart from anyone. That is not where I find my happiness.I am kind to others, I don’t set out to be an inconvenience to anyone, I try my best to help everyone around me, even if I don’t want to or it messes with me life. I don’t care about what anyone else thinks of me. I like being me and that’s fine by me. 
My husband is the exact opposite of me and that is where we break down. What once was our greatness strength is now our weakness. Once upon a time, that worked for us but it doesn’t anymore. He is exceptional. Everything he does is amazing, he does nothing half assed. Everything he does or tries, he is almost instantly good at. Where I have to actively work hard to do anything and everything, he just does it with even trying. My point being is, he is exceptional at everything and at best, I’m average. It has taken a toll on our marriage. He truly is a good man and he has a good heart.  He always supports me, he is always kind and encouraging in me bettering myself. Like I said we are just 2 different people. I’m holding him back and I have been for years. He doesn’t get my perspective because everything comes more naturally to him. Being exceptional is second nature to him, even though I know he works hard at it. He doesn’t see how hard I work just to be average.  He doesn’t get how hard I work just to be average and he never will. It isn’t something he can ever see or understand. So I am taking the steps to divorce, our mindsets are just not the same, even if we have the same goals. We just don’t “get” each other the way we should so we hold each other down.

I recently finished and passed year 10 (aus) and I don’t really know what to do anymore. I (F15 btw) have suffered with anxiety and depression for a long time and am on medication, but I still need to keep myself distracted from the never ending feeling of doom and emptiness of this downward spiral that feels like a black hole I can never escape.

Before the school year finished, in the second semester I started to pull up, and focus and started getting A’s and B’s very frequently, and I would fully concentrate on school work and exams (got an A+ for psychology exam :D)  but now that the school years done, I do have homework but nothing to occupy my mind with.

It’s summer and I’ve spent almost every day inside cause my anemic ass hates the sun, and I’m slowly socially isolating myself, fully aware and not doing anything about it but being depressed and smoking weed daily, wanting to get high on xanax mdma and Valium, or any other drugs other than ice or H that I can get my hands on

I’m not a junkie, just use drugs to help cope but I see how it looks, I’m still really smart though

I don’t know where I’m going with this other than I just have no clue what to do or how to save myself anymore and I am so bad with people now from the isolation and I guess I just needed to rant where it’s anonymous and I hopefully won’t get judged or told “I don’t care”.

52,"The amount of posts I see about weddings ""gone wrong"" or that have been ""ruined"" is unbelievable. People are upset that guests dye their hair, get a piercing, a tattoo, a hair cut, whatever before their wedding. wth?

Don't get me wrong, I get that, as the marrying couple, it's your day. You should stand out, feel celebrated and all that. I also get that if it's a traditional wedding with the bride wearing white, noone else should wear white, obviously. And if there's a dress code, obviously you adhere to that as a guest.
But if someone goes from brunette to blonde? If someone gets a nose piercing? My goodness, this won't ""ruin"" the wedding! How insecure must one be to think it will take attention away from them? Is it really that important that all bridesmaids look the same? I'd rather have all my favourite people with me on that day, the way they feel their happiest, than have a bridal party that looks identical and fits with a theme.

Okay, rant over. If you have read so far, thank you :D

Also, maybe you can give me some insight into where these issues come from. Is it a cultural thing? I'm German, and I have personally never witnessed a wedding that was as big and strictly planned as a lot of American weddings seem to be.
Is it just represented disproportionately in the media because we only see the very few weddings that are so strict?
Is it just a personal thing and I've never witnessed it because my friends just aren't like that?

53,"First of all, I'm not a professional. This is all my own observation, and things I've heard from various places. If you disagree with anything, let me know in the comments!! 

HOW TO ARGUE: 

In relationships, our emotions are really intense. You are each others priority in life above most others. They are the person you want to spend your life with. Therefore, when we do something that upsets the other, it is of much more significance than when others do the same thing. 

Sometimes, in relationships, we can get angry, we can feel ignored or not heard. These feelings are awful, but valid. Don't question how you feel, you felt it. You clenched your fist, you cried the tears. Even if you realise it's illogical, you still feel that way. It's worth discussing. 

**But, how do we talk about stuff like this?**

This is one of the greatest struggles in relationships. No matter what, at some point you will feel something negative to do with your partner. This is really hard to handle. In this post I'm going to try and give tips on the best way to handle arguments. 

**1.** Don't try to hide how you feel, or send hints through passive aggressive comments. Your partner is not a mind reader and will most likely miss these hints. 
This is a huge issue because it can lead to you resenting your partner for not getting those hints. Then, when it all comes to light, you'll both feel hurt and mistreated. So, what other ways are there to communicate your frustrations? 

**2.** In reality, there is only one way to communicate your frustrations clearly. That is to be direct. Tell them exactly how your feeling and why you are feeling that way. Don't hide it, or try to make excuses or downplay it. It won't get resolved in the way you need if you don't be honest about the initial problem. 
Some of you may be thinking ""but I've done this before, and I was only met with hostility"" 

This is because there are good and bad ways of being direct. What are the good ways? 

**3.** When you bring up the issue, remember that your partner is probably clueless as to what's going on. When you bring this up, you need to be respectful of their feelings. The most important thing is don't guilt trip them, don't try to place any blame. The only thing you can do is explain that they did a certain thing, which made you feel a certain way. Acknowledge that they probably had no idea this was making you feel this way. Don't try to make it a fight, try to make it a discussion. Placing blame will only make them defensive and disagree with you. People don't like to be told they were intentionally doing something wrong. It's not a good feeling to be blamed for things. 

But, what if you are the ""problem"" in this occassion. How should you react?

**3.** When presented with an issue, be open. Try not to be immediately defensive and close yourself off. Consciously have open body language, and have an open dialogue. Don't say things like ""I wouldn't do that"" or ""It's not my fault you feel this way""

When our partners are upset with something we've done, they don't want us to feel bad. They simply want us to be more conscious of what we've done that upsets them, so we learn to change our behaviour. Listen with the intent to make your partner feel better and more secure. If your partner is not being reasonable, sometimes you have to defend yourself. But often we feel as though we are being attacked when we are not. Don't take it personally if your partner has a problem with something you do. Try to listen to their side and try compromise.

**4.** How to come up with a solution to an issue? This is often a hard step to complete, because often you both want different outcomes. This is the part of the conversation where you both have to decide what you're willing to sacrifice for the other. A good example is, The boyfriend enjoys video games. So much so, sometimes the girlfriend feels ignored by him because he spends a lot of time on there. The boyfriend needs to decide whether he is willing to give up some gaming time for his gf, and the gf needs to decide whether she will sacrifice some time to learn to play the games with him. In most situations, both parties can do something to help better the situation, and either of you expecting the other to completely fix the situation will not work out long time. You both have to work for each other. 

**5.** The issue is fixed, but everything still feels tense. How do you fix this? 

For me, I believe that every argument should have an ""after talk."" This is where, once this have settled down, a solution has come to fruition or you at least understand each other, you then talk about the argument itself. This is important because *the argument itself is a negative feeling event that occurred between you two*. It doesn't feel nice afterwards, sitting in the negative juices of that conversation. Even if it was productive, there are still feelings of guilt. 

The after talk is so important because it's where you learn to communicate better. In the after talk you should discuss how you think you both handled the conversation. Eg. ""I'm sorry I made you feel like it was your fault. That wasn't my intention, I'm sorry I sounded like I blamed you."" 

Or

""I'm sorry I wasn't willing to listen at first. I felt angry and got defensive. I'll try to be more open next time"" 

The after talk is like having after care, after sex. You need to check in on each other, see where you can improve yourselves, apologise for mistakes and comfort each other. Don't shy away from these feelings
of guilt, they will build up and explode into a worse argument. You need to continue communication after an argument and be honest and open. The after talk is crucial to how your next disagreement will play out. 

So, there we go! This is my ""guide to arguments"". The only fault with this guide that I can see is that both partners have to be dedicated to this point of view. If one person isn't as dedicated at the other, your power balance will be disrupted. Sometimes, you may have to be angry, or loud or rude. We're all human and we all make mistakes. I want to emphasis that no matter what mistakes you make, *you can always have the after talk*. It's essential to checking in on each other.

I urge everyone to try this, and to practice it. Your arguments will become productive and improve your relationship, rather than wear on them.

She’s an extreme type A and tends to “hog” all the work. She checks her work emails 24 hrs a day including evenings and weekends so she does all the work before I even know it exists. She stays late and will work through the holidays and March break.

66,"I had a great job in the US, working as a Senior dev at one of the largest IT companies. Then, my mother at home (in Central Asia) asked me to come back to help with expanding, which at the time was a pretty small business.

I left my great paying job and came back to my home country and started working. The company i co-founded was apparel company. I automated and digitized the whole production line. I helped grow the company to 220 employees.  
I made most of the best selling designs which are still bestsellers and selling like hotcakes even today.

My mother first promised that I would have a 33% equity in the company, I believed her. Then she changed her tune to 25% which I also agreed. Then in the end my whole family (my sister, brother and mother) ousted me. In the end I got screwed by my own family and left with nothing. I never got any equity. Just promises and in the end I am left with nothing. My sister always made up some things and would always paint me in a bad light in front of my mother. In the end my mom just told me to leave. I picked up my stuff, took my wife and left the company with nothing. I didn't even take a salary when I worked at the company for 2+ years. My family refused to pay me anything and since officially I never owned any equity, there's really nothing i can do.

I can't go back to the US now, since I abandoned my work visa. I am here stuck in the third world country. I tried founding several companies after I got ousted but most of them so far failed.

70," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ on email replies and said it in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. Sometimes she will ask me something related to jobs etc then when is she whatever is ya she will abruptly reply ‘did yer’ in what seems a snotty/sarcastic way 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

71,"I wish I'd never agreed to having a threesome with my wife

I feel like I'm doing better now, but I wish I'd never agreed to a threesome with my wife by inviting another dude. I love my wife like Boomtown from *Letterkenny* loves his - intensely. And although I'm not a piece of shit like McMurray, I do feel average while my wife is a dime piece. 

That's why we had no trouble finding a guy to join us once I finally caved. I held out for four fucking years because I knew it'd be a bad idea, but in the end, I caved because I don't want my wife to leave me. Chickenshit, I know. But whereas I'm an average dude rocking a Dad Bod, complete with a hairy chest, woolly beard, and the Dad paunch, my wife is a petite little piece who is an absolute smoke show - and dare I say it - an amazing round ass. 

But she's so much more than that.

She's the mother of my children. My best friend. My confidante. She's the brains to my brawn. The hardest worker I know. I pale in comparison to her. I do. 

But being the sex positive person I am, I caved. I invited a coworker who was essentially a dollar store Johnny Depp (I don't give a fuck what you say this guy was better looking than me in every way; when the pictures/videos were up on places like r/GWCouples and r/gonewild30plus, there were folks agreeing with that assessment. I don't blame them; I've just never held my aesthetics in high regard. 

But I fucked up. The first MFM was disappointing - he couldn't keep his hard on, he didn't finish, and according to my wife he wasn't as big as me. So in my infinite stupidity - and yes, this is fucking dumb - I let him take an early break and told him to go to my house and fuck my wife. 

I. Am. Fucking. Stupid. 

Next thing I know she's raving about how hot their little quickie was, how quick he came, how fucking dirty it was.

I allowed it to happen again.

I. Am. A. Thundering. Dipshit.

By now, it was clear she was more invested in him. He only wanted to fuck her, but not without my permission. Even though I had my reservations, I caved to one more threeway, and although he too had reservations, he agreed to it to. 

Wasn't really much of a threeway; she was more into him, and since he saw there were some issues, he bowed out afterward and blocked both of us on social media. What ensued was a bunch of fighting, tension, anger, etc. She was angry because I had run him off, I was angry because she wanted to fuck a pretty boy so bad it was hurting us.

Even when it came out that he was cheating on his wife, her response was, ""Her loss."" She corrected herself when I asked her what the fuck she was on about, but that first impression stuck with me. 

We eventually leveled out before shit got worse between us, but once we got back to posting on all the NSFW subreddits, we started talking about another threeway. We had a guy come by, actually, and he was great. Not on the sex side of things, but was clean, respectful, and everything you could ask for in an extra body. But my wife wasn't fully turned on, and he couldn't keep it up - I'm guessing I made him nervous. I have been told I have resting psycho face after all. 

But it was interacting with a guy 10 years younger than her, that she messed up. First - he advertised being a bull, and although we weren't looking for a bull, she sent him a DM anyway before I had a chance to explain to her what a bull was. I tried to talk to him what our rules were and received a message saying, ""I'd rather talk to your wife, thanks."" 

Still, they video chatted without me knowing and she sent him a SEXY AS FUCK video of her stripping - I'd never received anything like that. We've patched things up since and I've yet to get anything like it, and doubt I fucking will at this point. But she made him the video and sent him the video without me knowing until long after. I say long, in reality it was maybe an hour. She showed it to me too, but I wasn't the first guy in mind for it and it pissed me off. 

It became such a point of contention that she finally said she was done doing that shit and didn't want it anymore - neither did I. She said it was more trouble than it needed to be and it was hurting us. Holy shit, I couldn't agree more. So for the past eight or nine months, we've worked on us and ourselves. Deleted our NSFW reddit, took down our porn videos, etc. 

But whereas I used to be a calm, confident guy, her ""rock"" as she put it, I'm now racked with anxiety and have gone through some depression since. I'm coping better, but I'm always thinking of our fights and how she chose those dudes over me. We've talked since and exhausted the topic, and there's not much else to say although we're at the point now where the sex between us is getting better and better. At least I think so. 

But we live in a small town and I'm faced with those reminders every goddamn day. What's worse? The first guy we fought about who cheated on his wife, turns out? I still see him. I want to ignore him as he does us, but still, like a fucking jellyfish I still call out to him to tell him hi and whatnot when I see him. Like a fucking coward. 

I'm coping better, otherwise, and we're in a better place than we were, but a lot of the things I saw, or felt, or fought with, it doesn't go away as easily as I wish it would.",23Dec2019,1
72,".. that bitch

She was the neighbourhood whore, she's left her children at like 8 different houses, 8 different pregnancies. Her tits are like 3 inches long.

That said, makes me think about fighting cats. Morally, I wouldn't even if there weren't animal abuse laws and all of that, I just don't want to harm animals.

But objectively, I want to see if I could take on that bitch. I probably can, but I'm curious to how much damage I'd endure or take on.

I wonder what the biggest animal I could fight barehanded and/or no rules street fight.

I don't think I could take on a horse even if it wasn't moving at all, you know like in Tekken practice mode, where you'd choose settings for how the CPU moves/defends

if I let the horse's health bar not regenerate, and made him not move, I feel like it would take me more than a few days to kick that bitch.",23Dec2019,1

74,"I had a last appointment to get travel expenses for my new job with my job advisor who I'd been going to for 6 months.

Then the next day I emailed  her again and asked her could I get a bus pass for the first week of work as I worked a week in hand and apologised again also about my misunderstanding and she replied ‘that’s fine graham, don’t worry, if you want to come in to office ‪before 5pm today‬ I can sort this out for you’. Later that day I  went in to my advisor and I sat there about 10 mins (I thought she’d of wanted rid of me quick tbh?) she asked me about getting to work and how much it usually costs etc. I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was writing the paper form out for the bus pass, so I apologised again she then said 'it's alrigggghht' (sounding annoyed) I then explained my manager questioned me about it and she seemed surprised and said 'did he?' And then she said 'just we have to contact them to confirm your employment' Then I said 'Its ok I understand' and she went quiet as she written the paper form out for me then just asked when I’m next in (my new job) I said tonight and she said ‘tonight?’ (Idk if she was passing conversation or asking about travel expenses).  A moment later she passed me the form and I stood up to go and said thanks, then she leaned forward slightly sitting down with her hand out and said 'awwwwwwwwwww, awwwww (more like rrrrrrrr) (it was prolonged than what I typed like an gap filler tongue tied I think) and said a few things then I said ok and slowly walked away (out of nervousness) she then said 'let me know if you need anything else' I just said ok and slowly walked away and then she said ' oh..and I'll stay in contact to see how your getting on, I'll contact you by email if that makes things easier for you' and smiled (I mainly Contacted her by email) (she said it all upbeat and bubbly) I said 'ohI’m  ok thanks, great' (I'm really shy)she said 'awww ok' then she turned back around sitting on her chair and said 'oh and...(I turned back around again) well done' and smiled and then turned back to her computer. she said well done a lot since I got that job",23Dec2019,1
75,"For as long as I can remember, I've had a hollow spot in my core. I try to fill it with love, but I can't make enough on my own, so I try to get some laughter and attention and affection to fill the rest in. If I let it stay empty, I get cold and can't feel anything but my tears corroding my heart.

And I can't bear that feeling, so I don't dare let anyone see all of me. I was bullied so horribly that I cried so hard I puked. 

I had one friend stand up for me. And my teachers. I decided then that I would be so nice that anyone who was meant to me would be called out by people braver than I was.

I must have done something right. The most common thing written in my yearbooks is ""Stay sweet!""

I had a temper, though. Bottling up all of that confusion and hurt made me volatile.

I struggled to make friends. Still do. Always second guessing myself, worried about making a misstep.

And high school... I loved it for my friends and all the shows I worked on, but I was so lonely. I only had three people come to my sweet sixteen. The only dates I had were ones I initiated, and they weren't exactly dates. For example: I took a friend to Sadie's because my cousin said that I had to experience a HS dance. (He said yes because that's the dance where the girl pays.)

Then I thought I had something with a marine I wrote letters to every week because I know how much loneliness aches. But he dumped me right before the USMC ball. After I'd gotten a dress and sent him the money for the tickets.

Then I was at an incredibly low point feeling incredibly unwanted, I met a man twice my age who convinced me that he was the only one who could love me.

I'm loyal. Loyal to the point of being stupid. He loved me, that's what mattered. And I was with him for almost five years. It was during that time that I ran into some guys from high school and asked them why nobody ever asked me out when they questioned my choice of boyfriend.

They said that they knew that they weren't good enough for me. That I was too special for their dumbasses. I agreed that they were, in fact, dumbasses, because I thought I had a head growing from my neck. Why else couldn't I find someone to practice kissing with?

With the support of a really fantastic manager and a pretty awesome roommate, I finally got the courage to dump the predator.

Roommate and I fell for each other. That wasn't planned. And I made him want to be a better person, that really wasn't planned. He had to decide if he wanted to settle down and be a good man or stay an asshole. He liked me enough to stay, and things were good.

For about seven and a half years, we worked together to make our story continue. 

Then I started to really struggle with my mental health after my back pain became debilitating. The cold was more pervasive. I wound up in the hospital for suicidal ideation during our eighth year. About six months after that, he had his first TIA, or mini stroke. And I was having neurological symptoms in addition to my mental health struggles.

Over the next couple of years, our relationship deteriorated along with both of our minds. He eventually broke up with me. We tried to be friends with benefits, but that didn't work after he assaulted me.

That was about 18 months ago.

About 8 months ago I met someone I just wanted to fuck and forget. But he wanted more. So I asked him to go slow, and he agreed. A few months later he told me that he hated me because he loved me, because he wanted to be a better person around me, but he didn't want to be a better person. After a few months of mixed signals, we're just fuck buddies.

And I don't really know what to do.

I've only ever had one person ask for my number in over 35 years of life, and turned out that he was already in a relationship. Guys don't talk to me at bars.

And I don't really have friends I can talk to...

It would be less expensive to give into my mental illness and just die than it would be to keep covering premiums and deductibles... And it would be less stressful for everyone than having to babysit a grown ass woman..",23Dec2019,1

79,"It’s where I currently live. I hate where I’m living now. It’s depressing, corrupt, barely even walkable, and filled with assholes that like to force their toxic positivity bullshit on you. My hometown was, and I believe still is different. It’s near the hills, it’s pretty, it has a wonderful, almost small town like charm to it. It’s not too big or too small, it’s easy to walk from one place to another, and the people there don’t force any bullshit on you. I mean some people are a tad rude and even weird, but that’s usually the worst of it. 

I’m staying near my hometown for the holidays, but after Christmas we have to head back. Heading back is always my least favorite part. I hate having to go back to that shithole city I currently inhabit. I used to not like my hometown until I moved, and now I wish I didn’t take it for granted. 

All my friends are still there, whereas where I live now? Making friends is much more difficult. The one friend I have made here has already inadvertently caused problems that wouldn’t have otherwise happened had I not gotten close to that person. Plus there seem to be more crazy shits over in that city than there are over here. 

I knew that place was gonna suck, and each day my fears were confirmed more and more. But my hometown is so much better than I ever gave it credit for way back when. I really don’t want to be over there anymore. I want to go back. When my flight arrived here yesterday, I already began to dread the inevitable journey back, and I almost broke down in tears. I want to  stay here. I can’t stand living back over where I currently live anymore. I just can’t do it. I wish I didn’t have the willpower to continue on over there. I wish I could just fall asleep here right now and never wake back up. 

But no. My body is too naive to realize how pointless going on like this is. It’s just not worth it anymore. I don’t know how much more of it I can take. I don’t want to endure any more of it. I wish I never left my hometown. Maybe then things wouldn’t be so fucked up.",23Dec2019,1

82,"Being raised in a Chinese atheist family in a politically correct US city, I was exhorted to stand strong and support my fellow non Catholics in not celebrating Christmas. My parents didn’t care. 

This was in the 1980s so Christmas wasn’t observed in China yet. I internalized the idea that I was supposed to wait patiently between October and February because it was my culture. But as I got older I stopped calling it “solstice” and “equinox” because i was exhausted. 

Later on I wanted to explore spirituality. Recognizing that my destiny did not lay in Christianity or Buddhism led me to the new age scene. It was here that I learned I still couldn’t celebrate Christmas and Easter because they were old eon. 

It pissed me off because not everyone gets to have these holidays growing up. As Sarah Silverman said give the Jew kid toys. It really does a disservice when people who resonate with a more hands on approach to spirituality aren’t allowed to have the same things as everyone else. 

It’s exhausting when your pagan friends are offended that you invited them to your Christmas party which involves watching Star Wars for chrissakes. Because it’s “old eon”... wtf?

85,"Triggers: Suicide, Sexual Harassment

Long read ahead:

(A little backstory)

As a child out of wedlock, I just wish my mother was able to abort me. She confessed to me that she used questionable products to try and make the pregnancy not stick but a few months later, I was born. (Abortion is illegal in my country, and contraceptives were not widely used back then.)

Both my parents were young, still in college, and the early months of my mom's pregnancy was spent in hiding in fear that my grandparents would find me and that my parents would be shamed.

The time I was discovered was when my mom was ready to give birth and my dad couldn't pay the hospital bill so he asked his parents for help. Cue family fighting over the pregnancy, cue fighting over if my parents should get married, cue which family gets to keep the baby, cue the lifelong issues I have now during my adulthood.

The memories I have of my childhood are blurry but I remember a few specific ones clearly. I stayed the most with my mom when I was young. We were never at a place for too long. I was mostly raised by relatives and my grandmother as my mom was too busy doing jobs as she can't hold a single job for too long.(IDK why.)

There was a moment where I stayed with my dad's. But I was told by my mom that he actually preferred to take care of my boy cousin who was born a little bit earlier than me. My parents were supposed to get married but my mom refused as my dad didn't have a stable job. After that I started living with my mom's mom in a provincial area where I grew up in until I was in the 3rd grade. 

I remember multiple nannies, my mom only being home at night, being sexually harassed by a neighbor whom my grandmother trusted, and crying whenever my dad picked me up for the weekends only to drop me back home the Sunday evening.

Then cue my mom's multiple boyfriends then finally, another pregnancy. I thought we'd finally be able to settle down because she got married to the guy that got her pregnant, but after a few house moves, continued harassment from MIL and the husband being gone for months at a time as he's a doctor that works on sea. She cheats on her husband with a young female coworker. After their 3rd year together, the worker finally shows her true colors as emotionally manipulative and abusive. 

This contributed to the unconnected feeling I had with my mother. She prioritized her girlfriend over her kids, constantly trying to please her, often misplaced her anger on me and I was already a quiet and private person but this just made me regress more into my shell whenever the girlfriend was involved. And the girlfriend was involved nearly 24/7 because she was my mom's worker and her live-in partner.

I went into a dark place during my stay with her and this was during my 7th grade up to 12th grade. Suicide was something I thought about a lot but I didn't pull through with it.

During my 4th grade up to 6th grade, I stayed with my dad and his parents. At first, I was content living with my grandma with my dad. I was taken care of, had a normal-ish childhood, but when my father moved out to live with his new wife next door. That's when I started feeling disconnected with my dad.

I feel like my stepmom resented me as I destroyed her vision of having a Nuclear Family with my dad as I was his kid from another woman who she now has to take care of.

It was the first time I had an authoritarian parent figure and to me it felt like I was suffocating as I was used to being raised as a child overly protected by the grandmother. I remember crying because she forced me to finish me a portion of vegetables and her passive aggressiveness towards me whenever we were alone in the house. She'd act like it was the biggest inconvenience whenever I didn't know how to do a chore like how to work the washing machine or how I have to move the displays and then use a rag to wipe the dust off. Then I remember getting my first period and staining my bed sheet. I had never been more afraid that time because I know she'd get mad at me for staining her bed sheet to I had to immediately get up and run the spot under water and soap it so the stain would go away, then rush back to my bedroom, place the wet sheet back and point a fan on it until it dries.

I was okay with learning the chores, but her getting mad was something I always feared, along side her passive aggressiveness. She had me on a schedule: Wake up early, breakfast, dress up, school, back home, shower and dress for bed, dinner, clean then sleep. By the time 8:30 pm rolled around, I was already in bed. My dad comes home from work at 10 pm the earliest then usually 11 pm. At times, I'd actually hear him coming from from my window, but I didn't come out of my room to greet him because I was afraid my SM would get mad at me for not being asleep.

 I endured 2 years before I slowly integrated my weekend sleepovers at grandma's to fully moving in with grandma's next door. This left me with much more freedom, but more isolation. But at least grandma was much more accommodating.

I am now studying for my bachelor's degree in Psychology and looking back, I realize that my lack of stability during this essential development period led to the person I am today. I have no diagnosed illness however, I have the hardest time socializing and opening myself up to people. Family doesn't feel like family. And I envy my male cousin who's the same age as I am. He grew up in a proper and stable household. We both have our driver's licenses but my grandparents see him as the more adult one and let's him drive them to and from hospital visits. He is also much more open to his parents and our grandparents while I'm the child that never comes out of it's room. 

I have no confidence talking to my dad, and our conversations feel like business meetings, I can't handle being around my mom as she still feels like she's in her 20's and at this point is over bearing to me. She continues to treat me like a child. She's your typical Facebook mom who overshares and tries to portray that her life is great. 

I feel like everything I do doesn't match up to my dad's standards, and I am sick of my mom's neurotic need to stick with her youth. 

I guess I must be much more tired today as this is the first time I wanted to vent out my feelings. I'm hoping more people become responsible parents so as to avoid situations like mine, wherein the child feels alienated from it's family.",23Dec2019,1

92,"As the title says, I am becoming emotionless gradually. 

I am sorry for my bad English. I am a non native speaker.

I was a very emotional kid. Here are some examples:

I was the most emotional kid in my classroom. When I was in 3rd grade I spent a whole day in school crying because my cat had died and they had to call my parents to take me home because I was not in the condition to be left with anyone else. 

Whenever I couldn't sleep I would get the thought of my parents or a close one dying and I would spend the whole night crying just because of the thought of it. 

When I was 13 years old, my mother had been away from home for about 2 months because she had a training in another city. I would spend every morning crying and looking at my mother's pictures.  I used to always think about her and hope she would come home soon even when I was in classroom.

When I had secured the first grade in my class after 5 years when I was around 16,  I had distributed chocolates to everyone in my class.

When my crush had agreed to go on a date with me I had thrown a classroom party because of the joy.

When I got into relationship with my current girlfriend, that was the happiest moment of my life. I feel amazed that I used to be so happy at those times. 

I had thrown classroom parties at multiple occasions and had given treat to my friends because of me feeling happy even for a small cause. 

When my first dog died, I remember crying for days. I couldn't even eat or sleep properly. 

Now let me explain why I feel I am becoming emotionless gradually.

When my second dog died, I cried just once. After that, I did not feel a thing. When I see his pictures I get hurt but not to extent I used to be.

I had not secured good grades after middle school. I just joined college and for the first time in many years, I once again topped my class in 2 tests. I acted happy because I knew I was supposed to be happy but from the inside I did not feel happiness. I just felt a tiny spark of joy but it didn't last even 2 seconds.

I used to get affected when someone called me names or criticized my appearance but nowadays  I don't give a fuck even if someone says bad shit about me straight at my face. 

Whenever I used to hear news of anybody's demise, I used to cry a lot. I used to be the last one in my family  to know about any relative's death because everyone knew I would break down and start crying. My father's aunt died because of cancer about 1 and half months ago and I felt almost nothing. I shed tear once and that's it. After that I did not feel a thing.

These are only few examples. I don't cry when I have fights with my girlfriend (I used to cry a lot even at small fights). I don't feel happiness, sadness, grief, sorrow or anger. I have not become completely emotionless yet but I think if I keep losing my emotions at this rate I may be emotionless in less than a year. 

I get a completely different picture of me when I look 2 years back.

Is it a psychological problem? or is this a age thing? I am 18 and half currently and my emotions started to decrease when I was 16.",23Dec2019,1

98,"Growing up I was so restricted and controlled by my parents. There were so many things I wanted to do and experience but due to where we lived, finances, and my parents being strict, I wasn't able to. 

I moved out when I was almost 18 and basically went crazy for 3 years and was going down a slippery slope of alcohol and drugs. I was miserable. 

When I was 20 I had the opportunity to move across the country. It was a fresh start. From there I met my amazing partner of 6 years and we've been living a pretty sweet life and I'm free from alcohol and drugs.

I finally got to travel, I moved to a new country which I am a Resident of now. I've been doing all the things I always wanted to do as a kid. I feel more like a kid now than I did back then. I'm having so much fun and I can do whatever I want!

I always wanted to be a grown up when I was younger. I wanted control of my life and I used to fantasize about running away all the time. Well, I did it. I got about as far as I could be. 14,000 km away.

I still keep in touch with my mother, that's it. I visit every couple years and shes coming to visit me here soon and will finally meet my partner in person. We have a good relationship and I dont hold anything against her as my step/adopted dad was controlling and emotionally abusive.

Anyways. I've just been reflecting and I'm pretty happy with where I am compared to 10 years ago.",23Dec2019,1

100," I love my family but I currently live in a house with many of them ( grandparents, aunts, crazy mental ill uncle and kids who never shut up). It's my fault I'm here, bad life choices but I need an out. I wish I was working. I even contacted a catering chef I know to see if they needed some holiday help but no luck. I’ve spent the past few days baking for the Christmas Eve party and am currently cleaning my grandmas whole house for it. I can’t really go with any of my friends because they all know my family and would have many questions. They might even contact a family member out of concern. I am already drained emotionally and even a bit physically.  I am broke or I would rent a hotel room for the day and just hang out smoking weed and watching movies on my laptop. I suppose I can volunteer somewhere but I don’t have a car, bad life choices again, so getting anywhere on a day public transportation is limited is difficult.

112,"This is my last semester of college and I’ve failed to make any lasting friends. They come and go, stay for a semester or two and then we kind of fizzle out. Or they move away. 

I’m trying to figure out inexpensive ways to meet new people. I’m 21f and like running, working out, drawing, writing, videogames, going out, etc. I just tend to do a lot of these things alone and thus don’t meet anyone new. 

I started a new job about a month ago and the people there are awesome but I don’t think they want to hang out because I’m about 6-10 years younger than them and in a different spot in life. 

I really need a group of friends to be with :( preferably female friends. I really enjoy having dude friends but whenever I get into a relationship or am not interested they don’t want to hang out anymore. It makes me feel really stupid and sad.

117,"I lie all the time, about the stupidest things. I create grand scenarios and plan about lying about them days ahead, just so I can gain some sympathy and attention. Perhaps I’ll stop one day when I get caught for it. I lie to manipulate people. I am an awful person. I claim to be all about love and I claim to be awakened but I am a liar. I wish I just could be honest but I feel like no one would like me if I was honest about myself. Which is simply paranoia because all my friends would love me the same if I didn’t tell all the lies I did. I tell different lies to different people and I live in fear they will one day meet each other and perhaps my lies will come out. I’ve lied about having several mental health conditions and being medicated for them, I lie about having dreams/nightmares, I lie about my past relationships, I lie about hurting myself, I lie about my creations (I plagiarise and pretend I did it myself), I lie about my feelings about people to their face. I exaggerate absolutely everything to make myself seem more interesting.

I know it is not good to be a liar, but I continue. I don’t think I could ever stop lying. I think I started lying because of childhood abuse and my fear of more physical and emotional abuse, this abuse still carries on now. I learnt to be secretive and lie about my life to avoid confrontation from my parents. And now it is a habit that I struggle to unlearn. Because no one has confronted me about it, I think I’m a good liar. Perhaps I’m a terrible liar and everyone I lie to is going to cut me off at any moment. It’s what I deserve honestly.

I suppose it’s good that I accept I am a liar. But I would never be honest about this with someone I knew. I am so ashamed of it.",23Dec2019,1

92% of your charity goes to the CFO of the NPO and not the people you thought you were helping

Your hard work at work only helps the boss get a larger bonus, and in turn a nicer car and better vacation destination

What if the people you helped, they all turned on you the minute you could no longer afford to help them, because your charity is no longer charity but an entitlement

And come Christmas Ball you’re the only one without a date because you gave all you had away and the girls all like nice cars and 6 pack abs

122,"So I have been in roughly 3 relationships since I was 18 (I'm 23 now) and those relationships have unfortunately failed due to mistakes by both of us. Now obviously I had to make mistakes to get the point where I realized what I was doing wrong and correct my behavior for the future and move forward and grow but the guilt of what happened and the mistakes I made is weighing heavily on me.

I don't even care anymore. You pieces of shit can go jump in front of a train for all I care. You are worthless, disgusting pieces of human trash for telling me that souls don't exist, that it is impossible for us to go on in some way after death. If that's honestly what you believe, then nothing matters. Morality doesn't matter. So stop trying to be a good person, and stop trying to guilt other people into being ""good,"" because at the end of the day, our actions won't matter. We'll all be dead, and humanity will die off too, as well as the earth.

I fucking hate atheism. I wish I could kill it, stomp it into the ground. It's a worthless, dead end philosophy, and as much as I try to be open minded about different belief systems, politics, etc., I have lost my tolerance for this particular brand of atheism. Don't believe in some kind of anthropomorphic Abrahamic God? That's fine. But when you sit here and tell me the soul doesn't even exist, basically telling me THAT I DO NOT FUCKING MATTER, then I'll flat out tell you your beliefs are worthless and you can go to hell...if such a place actually exists.",23Dec2019,1

127,"When I was 17 I had my first boyfriend (D) and he was mentally abusive. He was later diagnosed with BPD which made it clear to me why he treated me the way he did (lied to me about moving away on my 18th birthday and refusing to see me that, lied about his mom having cancer, lied about having HIV, would push me away only to beg me to come back). After going through therapy for this, I later found my second boyfriend (P) who was an alcoholic turned coke addict. He used me for rent money and transportation and physically abused me three times when intoxicated (choked me on my 21st birthday because I tried to roll him over because he was crushing me in bed). After more therapy I finally was okay with being with myself. I moved out, started grad school, I loved being an individual and still do. 

I’m now dating C, for about two and a half years. This is the most functional relationship I’ve been in, but now I don’t know how to act. I’m so defensive because I’m scared of being manipulated like I’ve been in the past. I was very affectionate with my ex’s, who both physically and emotionally pushed me away because they didn’t like affection. My boyfriend now is super affectionate and has no mental disorders. He barely even experiences anxiety (I’m diagnosed and take medication for extreme anxiety). 

Because of my traumas and anxiety, I’m triggers easily, I’m defensive, and my first instinct to something that he may have done wrong is to assume he did it to hurt me. Now whenever we have a fight it seems as though I’m in the wrong, but I can’t see it that way because it’s me trying to protect myself. However, I’m too late, I’m trying to protect myself from an old monster(s), but C is not one of those. 

I seek therapy and it seems that most fights I’m in with C (which is maybe every other month) are also a reflection of his traumas (he has trust issues because an ex cheated on him). Because of this, neither of us budge when we defend the reasons why we’re upset. I’m so tired of fighting because of my past traumas and I don’t know how to prevent a new fight, that’s also small but turned into a big deal because we both really value each other’s opinions and feelings. I’m not sure when I’m asking here but I’m tired of acting on my traumas.",23Dec2019,1
128,"Feeling pretty down. I haven’t spent Christmas (or any holiday) with my own family in almost a decade. Usually I choose to work over the holidays because it keeps my mind off of feeling sad that I don’t have a big family gathering to attend like everyone else I know. 



I long to have a closer relationship with my family and am sometimes envious if I hear someone griping about how their parents are over-involved and up in their business because mine are completely the opposite. Very hands off. Unless I reach out to them I rarely ever hear from them. No one ever seems to check in and ask me how things are going. I know I’m a successful adult but it still hurts to feel like no one cares. I am resentful of the fact that I always have to reach out first. Many months will go by without any contact. My mom will send birthday/Christmas cards that are completely blank on the inside. Not one handwritten thing. It’s pretty odd and hurtful. 


Anyways, this year I’m off work for Christmas. My boyfriends parents are here to visit for two weeks. This is extremely overwhelming for me to be in such close quarters with his family for this long. Two weeks is way too long in my opinion. In his family, a month visit would be normal for them and this is a quick visit. 



All the while I’m just longing to be with my family instead. My relationship with my boyfriend hasn’t been easy lately. I’m upset feeling like I’m putting in all of this effort of cooking/cleaning/buying Christmas presents/ and trying to be this perfect girlfriend when it all just feels like a chore. I don’t want to be doing any of this. And on top of it I just wish my parents were here instead. They are very strict Catholic and wouldn’t be supportive of my boyfriend and I living together so even if I wanted to invite them this year they would have said no. Part of me wishes I didn’t live with my boyfriend so I wouldn’t have to deal with my parents disapproval and so that i wouldn’t be completely overwhelmed with what feels like very wifely duties of dealing with his parents this long. Maybe I’m just pissed I have to endure this shit when we aren’t even engaged lol. 


They are nice people. I feel like a brat for being so miserable and sad in this situation right now. I’m trying to put on a happy face but I just want to run away. Or press a fast forward button and have it be January 3rd when they leave. I’ve decided next year I will do a better job of building a better relationship with my family.  End rant. Just needed to put my feelings into words. Hopefully no one will even read this far 🤣",23Dec2019,1

I know it's just the family and closest friends that really count, but I'm a lonely person and also kind of like a tiny bit of attention.

130,"Think about it for a second. Humans are fucking weird. We have arms that are long and break off into other smaller arms that we call fingers. If you take away our skin, muscles and bones all you have left is our nervous system and I can't look at such a thing without thinking about  Fry in that one episode of Futurama with the bouncing brains.  We can not help but get into the lives of others, we can't help creating drama or fighting amongst one another and when one of us accomplishes a thing everyone around them jumps around and hoots and hollars like a tribe of excited Chimps. 

&amp;#x200B;

Being social is so ingrained into our DNA we have to watch countless hours of TV or play countless hours of video games to feel like we fit in or are a part of this world, EVEN IF WE ARE ALREADY LIVING A GOOD LIFE.  Are naturally social. We can not help ourselves from fucking with one another we can not help ourselves from putting in our own two sense. It's all just so fucking strange. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are capable of miraculous feats while in a large group. Yet we choose to utilize that to do things like riot or harm one another or go to war or seek control over the rest. TO WHAT EFFECT THOUGH? WHY? WHAT'S THE POINT WE ONLY LIVE AT THE MOST ABOUT 100 YEARS. USUALLY LESS. Like who you trying to rule? They gonna be dead in a couple of years here so........

&amp;#x200B;

What gets me is our inability to not do the above. We can not help ourselves. We just gotta be in the center of it all. Gotta save the heathens, gotta convert the vegetarians, gotta stop women from doing what women do so they never realize they are actually eligible for normal human rights we've only granted to men for the last 2000 years. Now we have pronouns and genders within genders, satanic statues on the lawns of court houses when religion should be seperated from politics, Bible thumpers running the White House. Murder, conspiracy, control, money, gold, oil, boomers, millenials, hate, love, chaos. Half the world is burning and the other half is flooding. Fresh water has been run out, but the rich get to keep stealing from natural sources to resell it back to the people who keep that fresh water source clean in the first place, yet they wonder why everything is on fucking fire? WHAT?

&amp;#x200B;

LIKE WHAT THE FUCK.

&amp;#x200B;

The moment we learned we could trade a thing for another thing is the day humanity began it's long slow descent into extinction. If there was an Eden, being kicked out had NOTHING to do with some girl handing some boy an apple. I for one will welcome any extinction level sized meteor. Over the rest of our long slow descent. Cause the food is running out, the water is running out, the things we eat are becoming extinct and instead of trying to preserve ourselves, we have voted to open more coal/diamond mines, gave nestle more leave to drain whatever they want without even extra taxation and allow people to continue to poach wildlife while calling it ""tourism"". Because maintaining ecology is apparently also a myth, unless it directly affects the lives of the already wealthy and in control. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of us have a unique perspective and not one of us get along. Being human is fucking wild, but I'm not gonna lie. I hope next time around I get to come back as something like........ a fucking rock. You know what I would take insect or small forest creature. As long as it's in the woods far away from anything human. For all our advancements and everything good we do, there is a price that far outweighs the benefits. We are seeing it now, we just refuse to actually look.",23Dec2019,1
