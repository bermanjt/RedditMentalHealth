0,About really anything as long as your open to friendship.,16Jun2019,17
1,i used to go to my favorite restaurant every two weeks but i got surgery and couldn’t go for a over a month. now i’ve been back twice and haven’t seen him :( we really clicked but i am really friendly with everyone there and i never got the chance to write my number on a receipt or anything bc he was rarely my server. he’s not just the typical nice flirty waiter. we always talked even when he wasn’t serving. trying to work up the nerves to send friend request bc i found his fb. would it be weird out of the blue? i tend to overthink but i genuinely don’t wanna make the wrong move.  i’m so nervous,16Jun2019,1
3,"I often wonder how many people who I never initiated a conversation with had an extremely bad perception of me, a co-worker thought I was this until one day we ended up chatting for ages by chance in a previous job. I never used to get social anxiety now I get it all the time.",16Jun2019,14
4,"So, this is my first post on this board and I’m doing it because I believe that today many people are having huge problems with relationships because they either don’t know what they want or they get what they want and waste it.

I know that I am one of these people. I am the kind of person who will stay with somebody who is bad for them. I will fight and take hit after hit only to be left standing alone in the end. It happened again to me today. So I decided to just sit down and write what I wanted out of a relationship. And I think these things are universal but I think our generation has lost track of them. I know I have.

As I feverishly wrote down my desires in a relationship I quickly saw a pattern. I wanted nine things. I took these nine things and grouped them together. Forgive me if there is any accidental plagiarism in this. I’m big into metaphors so these sprang out of my head.

There are three components to what I believe is a strong relationship. These are base items. The cornerstones, if you will, and the foundation. To use a Knight as the metaphor, I grouped them together as The Heart, The Armor &amp; Shield, and lastly The Sword. 

1. The Heart - Is the soul of the relationship. Without it, the relationship doesn’t exist, and if a component is missing, the whole thing falls apart. It must be protected AT ALL COSTS if the relationship is to survive.
It is made of
     - Love - Love deeply and openly
     - Desire - Stir desire in each other, intentionally.
     - Fun - Have fun with each other. Laugh and play.

2. The Armor &amp; Shield - The Armor &amp; Shield protect The Heart. It allows for the love, desire and fun to survive through trials. 
It is made of
     - Care - Caring for each other when times are hard
     - Acceptance - Accept the other person for who they are. 
     - Dedication - Dedicate yourselves to the relationship. 

3. The Sword - The relationship and the people in it cannot make it though life without a way to push forward. This isn’t to strike against others but to pave a way forward.
It is made of 
     - Effort - Putting real, concerted effort into the relationship.
     - Stand Up For - Don’t speak badly of your partner and stand up for them when others do.
     - Support - Support their endeavors in life. They will take you on fun and exciting new journeys.

I think these things all make a strong and loving relationship that is worth lasting. From now on I will only accept a relationship with someone if they have these things for me, and I for them. If these things aren’t there, that’s ok, but that person isn’t for me.

5,"When I was 16, this senior 18, John took me out with his friends. We went to a party  was wasted. Him and two of his friends had sex with me. They called me a gross and ugly after. They ignored me for a while. John kept hooking up with me. Before all that happened, he was helpful to me and would hang out with me after he would only have sex with me if he was drunk and ignore me the rest of the time. He would never want to talk to me only about sex.



He left for the military over the years he kept in contact with me and saw me when he came home sometimes. He would only want to talk to me about sex or photos. He cheated on his girlfriend with me (I didn't know they were dating). He would have sex with me and ignore me. I went on vacation once, and my phone broke. He sent me at least 30 messages and was mad I didn't respond. He always implied that I was attractive enough to fuck but not date.



He would also imply that I'm weird or annoying. When I was 17, I tried talking to him about trouble I was having at school. At first, he was sympathetic but then told me to speak to someone else. Because of what happened I was bullied in school, I tried to talk to him because I was lonely . After three years knowing him, he told me he wanted me for sex and nothing more.



That he felt no connection to me. It's been four years since all that, and I feel broken. He still tries to contact me trying to cheat on his girlfriend with me or see me again. I try to ignore him then he'll bombard me with texts it works to face time me. I moved away and didn't talk to anyone he knows. He still keeps photos of me and sends them to me, asking if I miss this. I feel so used and dirty. Something must be so wrong with me.



I blew up at him and blocked him finally. He was messaging me begging for pics, and he now lives with his girlfriend. I feel sick. He recently emailed me saying hey I called him a rapist, a waste of space, ugly, a coward, an awful person.



I want this person to stop contacting me. I feel terrible. I haven't seen him for four years, but he still keeps original photos he took of me as a teenager. I thought he would have stopped when I blew up at him last time. He acts like I'm a rude cause he says he's just like that and he's never done anything wrong to me. He even said,” i don't deserve all this your saying about me.” But he's been contacting me when he's in a relationship of almost two years trying to face time or get photos.



One time when I blew up at him, and he left me alone for a couple of months coming back trying to apologize to me then to come on to me sexually then I went off hard on him calling him scum and saying I wish he were dead also, he lives with his girlfriend



Am I a mean person for sending these messages? Does that make me a bad person?",16Jun2019,0

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.",16Jun2019,0

Today, I tried to follow through with a promise from last night that I’d bring him coffee after I got off work, but I chickened out, and it was fine. I thought, I’ll just text him nicely, say I hope he isn’t too hungover and ask if he still wanted me to bring it. 
No response, still, and I know by now he’s off work.

14,"Im a generic invisible stupid boring r/niceguys and i dont know how to escape it or i will ever.. i have a boring life. Im such a loser with 0 friends. And i failed in school for two years. My yearz all wasted on porn and girls online.. whats my biggest problem? Why im like this

I never had a best friend or a GF.. no one cares about me. Im invisible. No one texts me or messages me first. Or asks questions first. I just dont know what to say, i dont have anything to say to make friends.

When i think about life i just think it doesnt make any fucking sense and its weird.. study, get a job, marry, have kids, then die.. my life is super boring. Im afraid of having no experiences or not doing any self improvement but im lazy and i dont know what to do to do better. I just feel empty. Nothingness.

But i think about not making my whole life about masturbation or porn or girls.. i dont know what i want my life to be about.. but i think about being good to others cause life goes fast.. idk im so confused and crying right now. Do i need to be positive and greatful for things i have and stop masturbation ? Things go better?? I feel like killing my self and ending it all so badly. Sometimes i think i should be happy im in this earth and experiencing it.. but still tired of my life.

I want people to love me and make me feel worthy and give me attention and ask me questions.. but people just reply with blunt one words to me. Every Girl ignores me.. im a boring person. Not fun to be around. Im lost. Is getting a girl really important??

I live in a small boring town only hobby to get is soccer.. dont fucking tell me to get hobbies. Cause i would if i could or had money..

I think about how i have No love and no one likes me or cares about me or cares to get to know me, how to make friends? How to have a personality?, how to have social skills? How to not run out of things to say or talk about ? Idk what to say to people to be my friend.., how to have a sense of humour?, how do i use my brain?, how to have intelligence? How do i stop wanting pussy or a GF? Its like i need a gf so bad, how to have charisma?, how to not be a loser?. I have nothing and im worthless.. how do i have my own opinions and values and interesting thoughts? How do i be creative ? How do i think outside of the box? How do i be smart? How to be cool? How to be funny? How to make others relate to me? Why i run out of things to say? How to open my mind to say more things? How do i love my self? How to stop chasing pussy? How to stop putting everyfucking one on pedestal? How to not be boring? How to ask open minded questions? How to make people take me seriously? Im tired of getting one word replies. Or im always the one starting convos and i get ignored.. how do i stop wanting likes and rts on twitter? It makes me feel unimportant when i see others getting ton of likes and rts but not me? Its like i want to be famous and get a lot of attention... 

Im just a nice guy i have no other qualities in me.. might be why im invisible and no one likes me, how to stop begging ppl just to be my friend? How to stop living life as a stupid brainless person?

Im dislikeable by everyone..how to make people to like me cause i have no personality?

Im so simple minded, my mind is very small, im absent minded. I dont have crticial thinking or open mindness.. im so simple, and any girl could get me easily, im easy to be fooled, im so stupid and retarded

Im jealous of guys who have all of these. I assume everyone has these. And i beat my self up cause of i hate myself.

Like how do i live my life not as a stupid foolish brainless invisible boring guy? 

whats my biggest problem in the posts i do? Do i even have any problems? Or it is porn making me feel depressed ? Should i do self improvement? Im 18/M. What an 18 year old should do? Enjoy life? What is life about? Who i am? Who should i be? Should i focus on making friends?

I dont know what the hell do i have to do to make people like me or give me attention? I always try to make them laugh so they just like me. But they dont care. What do i say that will make people care? How do i start convos? How do i make friends with people i dont know?

I feel very lost. Not happy. Or sad. I dont feel anything but i feel like going back to masturbation. 

I ask questions like an interview. Its always a tedious convo. I dont know how to ask open minded questions. 

How do people never run out of questions to ask about other person? Im horrible at starting convos too.

I say ton of things just to get replied by one words.. i care about Rts likes alot. Im jealous of people who get them.. i feel like im stupid and a fool..

I feel like i need people to like me so it makes me think im ""Fine"" and perfect. I cant say im Okay while being stupid and boring and invisible. Its truth.

These things go through my mind everyday

The only quality about me is being ""Nice"" and that doesnt mean shit. Being an asshole would be better cause girls would like that. I feel like being ""Nice"" is what i have become cause i stayed home for 2 years. Between 13-15. Im nice cause i have an empty mind nothing else to say.

I feel like everyone is better than me. More amazing than me in anyway and have more friends than me and having a lot of people loving and giving them attention them not me . Im not special or unique. Im not good. Im nothing. Im worthless.. i dont want my entire life to be alone.. i just feel like crying. I feel sorry for my self. I pity my self. I want to end my life.

Im boring cauze i have nothing interesting to talk about. I say 3 sentences girls just ignore me.. they say one words cause they feel bad for me. I want to change this fucking person i am. I hate being invisible. 
I dont have anything to say at all..

I depend on porn and girls to be happy.. but i chase approval and attention from girls ""online"" so they give me attention and i feel like im ""worthy"" but nobody gives me the satisfactipn cauze 

im a horrible person. An asshole. A crude. A egotistical stupid young guy that doesnt know what he is doing in his life... i feel purposeless.

I dont feel anything. Happy or sad. Idk what i should feel like... i just feel stupid, foolish, dumb, like a loser.. 

I try to use getting attention from girls and porn to escape my problems.. but i cant... most i hate about.my self is i fail at everything and im a naive stupid nice guy that doesnt know how to make friemds and i have no qualities. Its the truth.

I dont even know what i am anymore.

My car was stolen. I was drugged. Raped. And account reported as Freud.

I understand he's working, so we won't be able to mingle. I also don't smoke so I don't have an excuse to be outside making small talk. 

Last time I was there, I tried playing the eye contact game with him. I'm PRETTY SURE it worked but like, y'know, I never asked or anything. I would look at him from across the room til he made eye contact, and then I'd smile, hold gaze for a bit then go back to dancing. Did that like 3x.

But I wanna actually talk to him this time and gauge interest. At the very least I'd like to convey my interest. The bar is a hot spot so he also won't have a whole lotta downtime for chatting.

23,"I've had trouble on the throne pretty much since I was 30 (pushing 40 now). Hemorrhoids, fissures, extremely sensitive butthole troubles.  Long sits on the throne followed by wipe after wipe after wipe and it's never enough. I always dreaded visiting the shitter if I wasn't going to immediately have a shower afterwards. Luckily for the most part I'm fairly regular so that's rarely an issue. I'd tried different diet variations of diet with limited success. I eat a lot of fibre already. Lots of vegetables, soluble and insoluble fibres. 

Anyway I was watching Jack Black's Jablinski games a couple of weeks back, and he points out the Metamucil. [Said it changed his life](https://youtu.be/OkSsbOek44k?t=533). So I thought I'd give it a dip. 

**Oh my god**. It has actually changed my life. First morning I was all done seconds, perfectly formed logs, and minimal wiping. I couldn't believe it. With the no wiping and no straining came no irritation *at all*. Then the second morning the same thing, then I had a big Saturday night, booze and Indian food. Surely this magic substance can't withstand such torture. It did. The worst part of my hangovers recently has probably been the downstairs trouble more than the head trouble. 

This psyllium husk (That's what Metamucil is mostly) is no joke. It's like teflon for your shit. I love it.

26,"Using a throwaway since I'm really not comfortable publicising this but I feel like I need an outlet after everything that's just happened, so here goes:

My parents found out that I was gay a month ago. That's been a month of my mother crying through the phone, 200 miles away, and my father refusing to talk to me, period. My mom begged me to come back for Father's Day, so I said okay because maybe there was some time to get their thoughts in order.

Well, my mom's pretty okay, in that she's not so happy but she still loves me and accepts me no matter what. My dad, not so much. Basically told me that if I didn't disavow being a homosexual in any way, I'd be nothing more than an animal to him, and an animal wasn't his son. Then went on an incredibly homophobic rant, which by the end of it, I basically thought, he wouldn't ever see me the same again anyway.

So he disowned me. I feel very bad for my mother though, because she's stuck in the middle and she just wants everyone to get along together. And I have no siblings and we don't have any relatives she'd be able to talk to about this. So it's made even worse by that.

I can't have regrets though. My dad, during his rant, said that he gave me freedom and this is what I did, so I don't deserve it. Well, too bad, I guess. I've got freedom and I'm not letting go.",16Jun2019,53

I went out for a walk tonight outside of my apartment complex and my sister told my mom. I don’t know how my mom’s going to react, but I’m so scared I’m going to lose my phone, aka my only way to contact my friends. I’m scared of being alone y’all, I’m real scared. 

She’s our dad’s favorite, anyone with eyes can see that. He loves spending time with her the most and will always bribe her to do the most simple of chores we all share. She makes fun of my boyfriend and will shove and hit me any time something doesn’t go her way. I’ve got bruises all along my thighs from it. She insults me and has made a lot of comments about my weight (I’m overweight and working to lose it, so this stuff really really hurts), and because I’m both older and still living at home, I can’t retaliate. Granted, I’m not without fault, but I haven’t insulted her weight or dissed anyone she knows and hangs out with. I’m trying to be more grown up about stuff man. I really am. 

I think she’s started thinking that she’s entitled to spending time with me or something. I can’t hang out with my friends because she’ll get angry and start shoving me around while I’m with my friends. I can’t do anything to piss her off, I’m so scared she’s going to tell my parents stuff I’ve told her and trusted her to keep secret.

29,"Ok you saw the title now let's talk about. We all know that it takes time to fill out certain job applications, and some of them can be a downright pain in the ass. We also know how it can take some human resource offices to even review the applications and resumes. Then you finally get that call for an interview that you've been waiting for.  Now you burn gas to get to the interview, and depending on the company's location, you might even have to pay for parking. It's either deal with all that or call a cab, Uber or take the bus or metro train which still costs $$$. Ok so let's assume the interview went reasonably well, and the hiring manager even gave you a remote hint that you would be getting a call. So you wait... and wait.. and wait some more. Sooner of later reality sets in, and you begin to realize that ""call"" is never going to come because you didn't get selected for the job. You don't want to be a total pessimist, so you call the human resource office; give them your name and inquire as to whether the job announcement you interviewed for has been filled... and it has. Now you're somewhere between feeling disappointed and rejected... maybe even a little pissed off! Now right about here is where I want to cheer you up.

Don't let non-selection for a job get you down. Why. There are many reasons why people don't get selected for jobs, and not all of them are the job candidate's fault. Non-selection can sometimes be a blessing in disguise, and you ""might"" have dodged a bullet. LOL 

Sure some people don't get selected for reasons such as lack of qualifications or subpar performance during the course of the interview, but there are many reasons for non-selecting a candidate that human resource offices are not obligated or even at liberty to discuss with non-selected candidates. You should consider yourself lucky if you receive a courtesy notification of non-selection. 

Now here are some of the ***other*** reasons why you should not let non-selection upset you too much: 

* **Pre-selection** \- Pre-selection of an inside candidate and nepoitism remain an ongoing problem in the workforce. Many companies (along with the federal government are notorious for pre-selection, but the have to advertise the job and ""go through the motions for reasons such as EEO (Equal Employment Opportunity) and human resource office policies. It happens.
* **Outgoing Employee Decided to Stay At the Last Minute** \- Position was cancelled because someone decided not to leave and the boss really wants them to stay onboard.
* **Company Budget Restraints** \- Position was cancelled for budgetary reasons.
* **Job Is Contract Contingent** \- Some companies will let you know upfront that the position for which you applied depends on award of a commercial or government contract and sometimes not. You should also know that some staffing agencies will waste you time as well. The staffing agency recruiter, in many cases, is no more than ""paid liar"" whose purpose in life is the ask you for a ""Word"" version of your resume to reformat to BID for the job he or she lead you to ""believe"" was a Ready-To-Hire position. The do this in order to compete for the work with other staffing agencies, but most of them are not going to come out and tell you this... unless you ask and refuse to accept a vague and indirect answer. (I honestly suspect that ""some"" job postings aren't even real jobs, and the are rolled over again and again in the job search engines just to obtain candidates for future work, but I can't prove this suspicion.)
* **Discrimination Practices** \- *Ok now let's really get down.* Depending on the hiring manger, company atmosphere and/or geographic location, I have to acknowledge that even though it's illegal, non-selection due to age, race and sexuality still occurs. Even though we have EEO as a resource for assistance in these matters... trust me... the company will have already covered the real reason(s) for your non-selection with legal rationale, and the entire process can be one big emotional roller-coaster and waste of your time. You would basically need an ""inside witness"" who has first-hand knowledge as to why you were not selected based on actually hearing it said or saw it in an email or text message etc. The question then becomes would this individual risk his/her own job to help you out with an EEO case that you may or may not even win? My advice is this: Keep it moving, and save EEO as resource for problems ON the job because only a very few of these cases are ever won anyway. There is just too much ""fox watching the hen house"" in the mix in terms of the company's EEO program; their in-house attorneys and EEO itself, and outside lawyers cost money. This is why you need to have a ""rock solid"" case to start with and make sure to get it reported no more than 45 days after discovery of the incident in question. EEO can and will use late reporting as a reason to deny your claim for what might be a damn good case. Your company's attorneys are paid to cover their asses... not yours... and they will drag the case out forever and drain your pockets dry in the process to accomplish their mission of ""screwing you!"" Know this in advance!

Ok you guys... now you have now been informed, armed and empowered to some extent. Submit a well-written; well-formatted resume packed with all of your relevant experience, and don't forget to emphasize those action verbs for each bullet.

35,"This is something I’ve been wanting to write for a while. It’s a book idea I have had about giving advice. Something recent has happened and I’m tired of writing it for myself, so I’ll share it on Reddit. Like also writing for myself, but maybe there will be a couple people who nod their heads in the void with me. 

Anyway, this is about when you’re the bad guy in the situation. 

I don’t know if you’ve noticed this, but while we do sometimes like to point out that the world isn’t about just being black and white. We typically don’t apply it to people. That’s why we have the internet cancel culture. Once we see that someone can be bad, or “problematic”, we can only see them as bad. That’s why we “cancel” them. Even though the reasons why situations turned out the way they do or the way that people act is absolutely beyond being problematic or bad. We can only see them for the bad things that they’ve done. That’s why we decide they should be cancelled, worth hating on, and should definitely be ignored by the rest of us. 

But this extends beyond just the things we see on our screens. The same problem occurs in our personal lives when conflict arises between people. Especially when the conflict has an antagonist and a protagonist, although people may say that they don’t choose sides. They will more than likely lean either to the black or the white. It’s based on who they see as being the “right one”. The one with the most reason. Despite the fact that each side comes with its own reasons. 

And this is how you can help yourself deal with the fact that to some people, we are going to be the bad guy. 

It’s a pretty jarring conclusion. No matter how securely you feel within yourself, we aren’t immune to our inherent nature to want to get along with people to help further our survival. So, someone thinking that we are a bad person? Well, of course that’s not right! We have made our mistakes sure, but we had our own reasons for doing what we did. How can it be bad to act on our human emotions? We know we are not a bad person, so why do other people think we are? 

Perhaps, I’ll give an example. The reason I started to write this - I lost a best friend about two weeks ago. 

I don’t mean lost as in death, I mean lost as in to have someone you’ve known for six years of your life turn into a stranger that you once had memories of. That are stuck in a different timeline now. 

The way I lost her was unexpected and quick to say the least. Akin to death. The most that you should know is that she reacted in a way to something that had happened, I confronted her about that way (and it was not the right way to go about it. It was offensive. It turned into more of an attack than a confrontation), and she just left. In every aspect of the word leave. Physically, mentally, etc. She just left. And just like that our friendship was dead, like it had been killed in a drunk driving accident. Quick. Unexpected. 

I apologized the next day for the way it had come about. But she didn’t want my apology. She had already decided we weren’t friends anymore. She had already decided that I was the murderer.

I was the bad guy.

But unlike being dead, she still has the ability to communicate to others. Now, she’s screaming that I am the murderer. I’ve hurt her. She’s warning the others about me. And she’s allowed to do that. She’s allowed to talk about what happened, in the light that she saw it. But unfortunately she saw the light was red and I had watched it change to yellow. But she’s showing people that the light is red, and others are pointing out that the light is red too. 

And I’m the bad guy to more than just her. 

What do you do with that then? What do you do with now being the bad guy? The one who lit the fire. The one who held the knife. The one who ran the red light. 

I think you can do a number of things. 
But I think there’s some better ways than what maybe our natural instinct is to do. 

Our natural instinct is to immediately fix it. They have to understand my side! They have to understand that I was holding the knife because of this! They have to know! I’m not bad! 

But just like I mentioned earlier, there are some people who won’t be able to see you as a balanced person. They will only see what you have done wrong. You will forever be in the black area of their monochromatic world. You aren’t allowed to be gray, because you are now a problematic person and we have to get rid of you. You have to be punished for what you’ve done. 

And they will punish you in their minds. What you can’t do is let you punish yourself. 

You can’t let yourself see yourself as a bad person. At the end of the day, you have you. And letting yourself get caught in the fact that because there are people who think you are bad, therefore you must be bad will only damage yourself further. You can’t see yourself as a bad person because then you are never going to be able to handle you. And when you are the only consistent thing you have, you have to at least be able to lie with yourself at night in bed. 

There are now people that exist in the world that have bad thoughts about you. Maybe they even wish you were dead. That they had never met you. 

But you have to be able to remind yourself that you did what you thought was in the best interest of yourself. And sure, maybe you came off too strong. You pulled out the first weapon. But you can’t kill yourself over that. Your subconscious decided that your fight or flight response this time was fight. And that’s okay, that’s valid, you are allowed to fight. 

And don’t invalidate your own feelings. You can admit that your feelings were too strong. Aggressive. Mean. What have you, but if you truly stand behind what was said - don’t bottle it. You are allowed to feel what you do and you shouldn’t push that away for anyone. It will become even more of a catalyst. 

Learn from what has happened. Grow from it. Maybe it didn’t have to happen this way. But it happened this way maybe not even for a reason. Maybe the universe doesn’t give an actual shit how it happened. But it happened and now you get to learn from it. Your life will not be the same after it. But that is the entire point of life, your life should constantly consist of points in which it changes to ensure that you become more than just a meat carcass auto-piloting through life. 

Life is hard and then you die, but hopefully at the end you can say that you became something that’s not perfect in the way our perception of perfection has been out to be. But that you became imperfect and you are appreciative of every curve, scar, lump, and bump.

You aren’t the bad guy, you’re a human.",16Jun2019,4

39,"My gun-ho approach to life isn't working out too well. I didn't like the way I was eating, so I decided to go to extremes and try out keto. I didn't do as much research as I should have on it, and I went balls-to-the-wall with it and pretty much eliminated my carbohydrate intake. It doesn't seem that drastic, but when you go from chowing down on Taco Bell and Cheetos to keto, your body is suddenly put under a lot of stress because it has to process and entirely new kind of diet. Cue the KETO FLU! I felt (and still feel) like shit. Light headed, irritable, drowsy and really, really hungry. I toughed it out for a few days, but I'm also quitting smoking, and the side effects of nicotine withdrawal combined with keto put my body under too much stress because I started getting weird physiological symptoms as well. I don't really have social anxiety anymore, but if someone surprised me or if I made eye-contact with someone, I'd get a surge of anxiety. It's like I had butterflies in my stomach 24/7. So, I couldn't take it, and I went off of keto. I went off of keto the wrong way, and of course, I shocked my system even more with an influx of carbs. Now I'm all fucked up, I feel even more light-headed, I'm irritable, anxiety ridden, my gut is messed up and everything sucks. So yeah, learn from me. Research your shit and take things slow and gradually. Don't try and take on too many things at once, and, if you do, do it the right way. 

I assume (really hoping) my symptoms are from the dietary changes and the nicotine withdrawal. Hope I don't die! Peace.",16Jun2019,2
40,"This week has been *terrible* for me, if I'm being honest. I started my new job, which was all well and good, but even then I just didn't feel as social because of my anxiety which kinda made me feel bad. Today was the best day so far, if only because my chronic headache started to disappear and I accepted that I'm in love with my best friend. Long story, not gonna get into it (seriously, it's long). 

So I'm feeling a lot better now (i.e. I'm eating again, don't have a chronic anxiety/dehydration/hunger headache), so now I'm just straight up *annoyed.* I thought that I kinda tipped off my best friend when he called me (spoiler: I didn't), and there was a long silence at one point on the call. By long, I mean probably like...5 seconds? MAYBE 10? Not longer than that, certainly. And out of everything, my anxiety-ridden brain that hasn't been kept in check all week because I've been too damn weak to (which is ok sometimes! It happens, I'm not gonna guilt myself for it) *keep* it in check is focusing on that. And my heart is pounding in my chest because of it. 

I'm trying to take deep breaths and tell myself it's ok. That a 5-10 second silence doesn't mean he hates me now. It's so silly. I *know* I'm level-headed, confident, funny. Anxiety just loves telling me otherwise, and it's hard to beat it back down sometimes. 

This all being said, I've made a lot of progress this past year. I'm beyond proud of myself, even if it's hard to be happy and cheerful about it sometimes.",16Jun2019,2

45,"This is pretty long, so there’s a TL;DR at the bottom. 


Recently I have been starting to feel lonely. I haven’t really felt like this in a long time, because when I was at work I was constantly talking to coworkers and customers, so I couldn’t feel lonely. But I recently left my job to pursue music full time, which might have been a stupid decision to make at 18, but I’m happy doing what I do and have money saved up. 

Since I left my job, I have made it a commitment every day to at least see one friend, and talk to them at their house for at least two hours. And this really worked for the first month, but about two weeks ago, I found myself daydreaming about being in a relationship. I have never been in a “real” relationship. I had a girlfriend that lived in Turkey, but that ended in hellfire and other than that, I have never been intimate with a girl. I’m still a virgin, but I’m not in a HUGE rush to lose my virginity. I want to lose it to the right girl.  

And last week I saw her. I walked into my towns veterinary office, and there she was. Long, silky, dark brown hair. Perfect mocha skin. Big brown eyes. Lips that would make the meanest man melt with an air kiss and a smile that looked better than a diamond necklace from Tiffany’s. I instantly fell in love. I damn near forgot that my cat needed his special food, because all my attention was on her. She has worked there a while, I’ve seen her before, but never paid full attention while I was there. I was always tired from work or having a bad day. 

I was in awe. She welcomed me in, and I could barely get out a “Oh, uh, hi...” I have never had that happen to me, ever. I’ve always been able to talk to girls, no matter how pretty. But oh sweet Jesus, I swear to god my brain made a dial up noise, and I was working at 0.01% brain power. It was like the world around me went black and a light sent from heaven was shot directly on her. 

I walked back to the section where my cats food is located, and instantly messaged a close friend  explaining the witnessing of an angel, and what I should do. And he said “Buy small cans of wet food that are the same brand, so you can come in more often and see her more.” I thought he was a fucking genius. I grabbed four cans of cat food, and walked up to her section of the counter to pay for it. And remember how I said I was at 0.01% brain power? Yeah, well that came into play here. She asked me “What name is the account under?” And I forgot my own fucking name so I answered “Um, I’m not sure hahahaha, I think it’s under my moms name”  and she just laughs and looks at the screen and says “That’s fine, you don’t even need an account.” And then I said, the stupidest, most moronic thing I’ve ever said in my entire fucking life. “Oh wow, guess I’m the lucky boy today” I wanted to fucking die. Everything got quiet. The dogs that were howling like a pack of timberwolves? Nope, dead silent. I swear to god, I was 2.7 seconds away from stabbing a pen through my jugular to end myself, until she gave me the receipt and I hightailed it out of there. 

But, I’m still in love and don’t know how to ask her out.

46,"I still like him. Even after four years I can’t get over him. He makes me so happy. The only reason I get up everyday and go to school is because of you. You light up my world. Do I light up your world?

I don’t think he likes me like that. I think he just likes me as a friend. I try to be like the girls he’s into. Funny, outgoing, pretty. They are everything I’m not. They are everything I want to be.

Him and I are pretty good friends. We can joke around and not get mad about anything. He has made this past year of school amazing. He made everything less stressful. Next year, we don’t have any classes together. He will possibly forget about me. But I won’t forget about him. I can’t. He’s the only boy I had a crush on.

51,"Me and my ex. were LDR and met when my FOMO was starting to kick in; coupled with work stress, in some months I found myself facing mild severe depression. There have been times when I would need a Ted Talk, each morning, just to get out of bed and go to work. I had my own share of contribution to make my ex pull away, I never denied my involvement and I tried to apologize.
But, against my own issues, I have always been there for him:

- when he complained about his job and mentioned how his friends had good jobs, lamenting he still has to find what he likes for a career, that he can not work a retail part time forever. I suggested he tried game testing or IT.

- I listened to him complain about his sister, while he lived in her apartment, looking for a new place. Saw him act disrespectfully towards her and swearing at his mum, when she only tried to help how she could.

- I have been there when he was down, stressed, when not even his old friends have not.

- I bit my tongue when I knew he was wrong, lazy or naive, looked over the flags. I AM guilty of that and have never denied, even to him.

He chose video games over me when I asked for help or to hang out, he told me he did not find me attractive and that his friend would like me since he is into ""skinny girls"", he blamed me for not knowing what he wanted (telling me those were my ideals he tried to respect).

We remained friends and kept in touch after breakup. Three weeks after separating, he got a crush on a coworker who was older than him. He thought she was 28, while she was 45. A couple days later after being rejected, he flirted with me.

Our last conversation was about me standing up for myself, which made him unfriend me. He rejected me for being myself, which still hurts me. I have been insecure many years and when I finally have found myself, being rejected for that makes me insecure again.

Dear ex, whom I was ""too intense"" for, I, a 7.5/10 as told by other people, dated a gamer who was not able to tell me ""what or where he wants to eat"".

&amp;#x200B;

I am kind of shocked so few people have said yes. The post was created on thursday, yet out of the 30 people in the class, only 24 people have answered and 18 people said ""yes"". It has gone painfully slow. I can't help to think people are having second doubts because they now know I will be attending. During our time together, I have been distant to the rest. I was  lonely and didn't spend much time with other classmates. I have been shy and rarely gone up to anyone, oftentimes others would take the initiative to create a group.  It's really only recently that I realised I should try to be more socialable, which is why I said ""yes"". Plus it's the graduation party. But I am having my doubts now. First of all, I am afraid I won't get to be that social, that I will as usual end up by myself, walking about and biding my time, waiting for the party to be over. And maybe my precense is enough to scare 6 to not go (and one of them is the best friend of the host?) and many to reductingly agree. As I have said, I am not exactly ""a part"" of the class. if my presence ruins the evening for everyone else, and I am unsure if I could enjoy myself at all, maybe I shouldn't come. We will after all see each other on the actual graduation.

I really don't know what I am supposed to do. I have been worrying about this since thursday.

Should I stay or should I go?

Backstory: My parents are from two small villages in Hebei, China. So they speak the dialect from that place. (That’s going to be important later.) They met in middle school and got married after they graduated from university. My father is still in China because of work and my mother and I lives in Australia.

I first found out signs of my mother cheating about two years ago, I was on my phone taking some pictures when a text message popped in. (My mother used to use my phone a lot for work because I didn’t need it back then.) It said: “Wifey are you still sleeping?” I immediately froze, because my father always calls my mother by name and they never text on that texting app. My mother was right next to me but I didn’t have courage to confront her because I was confused as fuck. 

I realised that I recognise the username, it’s being on my mother’s contact list since I could read. It’s not my father’s because I had his contact; the profile picture and username is completely different.(I blocked him on that texting app though because he was stalking my activities.)So I am worried that this affair have been going on for more than I think. 

One day I found that she logged into her account on my phone again. It’s an alt account with only the person she is cheating on. (Calling him dickhead from now on.) I went in it and did some investigation, and it said some of the most disgusting shit that I can never imagine my mother can say.
“I love you so much.”
“Spoil me when I get back from Australia.”
“I miss you.”
Just your stereotypical super in loved couples’ conversation, but my mother never said anything remotely similar to my father.
Found the pictures they send to each other, he is also from a village, possibly from my mother’s village. But I overheard them calling each other at night ( I can hear them at night because the walls of my house is shit.) and they speak mandarin, even though I cannot make out what they are singing but I can identify the accent. So it’s 100% not my father. I managed to find his photo, his ugly as fuck. Few minutes later my mum came out of her room terrified as she got a notification on her phone that her account was logged in, she was like: “honey let me borrow your phone.” I opended that texting app again and her account was gone. But I am sure that she don’t know that I know

I occasionally spot them talking, and everytime she is texting dickhead she will hide the phone from me. Just red flag after red flag, like her cold attitude to my father every time they see each other again, calling my father by his full name, closed the notification of my father’s messages,and I heard her moaning in the early mornings.(Probably phone fucking with dickhead.) I saw her sending pictures of me to him, I’m disgusted by that.

Every time my father calls me he will tell me to take care of my mother, it just makes me sad because he loves my mother so much but my mother don’t even see him as a friend. I’m only a teenage girl and I don’t want to get in the middle of this. Should I confront my mother? Should I tell my father? I need help.",16Jun2019,8

79,"This bill, Student Medical Leave Act, which I wrote back in October, would (in my hopes) grant federal requirements to colleges and universities to make it a policy to allow students to stay enrolled in school while undergoing “significant life events” that may cause them the inability to attend class face-to-face. When I went to mental health treatment for 4 weeks, I wanted to stay in school (hand in my papers, do the readings, participate in online discussion) like normal, but just not attend class. My school (located in WI) was like... we’ve never had that before.. your options are to withdraw, medically withdraw, or take incompletes. My professors were not about the incompletes, and I’m too broke to take a withdrawal, especially since it was very near the end of the semester. This bill could also work for single parents enrolled in university who may have to take a few weeks off to care for a child, or someone who undergoes medical treatment but may choose to stay in school. Literally, almost everything in university is online, so this policy makes sense. America is preaching about caring for students with mental health needs but we need to move past just attending to generalized anxiety and long wait lines in university counseling centers and start supporting students with serious life-threatening life issues due to mental health or medical illness.  Plus, a large majority of students who drop out or withdraw rarely go back to school after. This would help prevent this patten. 

Now this policy wouldn’t work for all students. I get a population of students could not, or should not, try to remain in classes while undergoing a life event. For my though, I’d been dealing with serious mental health issues my whole life and knew how to balance treatment + classes + being student body President at the time. 

I’ve lobbied this bill multiple times in Madison and DC, and recently just submitted it to the American Psychiatric Association and National College Leadership Council. I’ve heard every person I’ve talked to about it share their story of how either a policy like this would have helped them, or someone they know. 

Is it just me?? Does this policy not make sense? It mirrored from FMLA, which my mom took during my time in treatment. I know FMLA has its flaws and SMLA might too, but like, is this not a thing that should be happening?",16Jun2019,1
80,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I'm currently single and dating but I keep getting annoyed at the quality of people that I end up chatting to and it's made me super paranoid that I'm a ""nice girl"". 

I don't want to get into a relationship for the sake of it, I genuinely want to find someone I connect with where we can both bring something to each other's lives. I'm not having any luck really though because even when I feel like I connect with someone, they just want to talk about sex all the time. 

Don't get me wrong, I love sex as much as the next person but I have a personality too and it's been really bothering me that I'm struggling so much to find someone to have proper conversations with. I'll usually say something along the lines of ""can we get to know each other and meet and stuff before we go into the sex stuff?"" But I just end up getting ignored. I make it known that I'm looking for dating and getting to know someone and I'm not interested in a one night stand or fwb type thing. 

So am I getting annoyed because I'm a ""nice girl"" or does it make sense that I'm getting annoyed? If this sounds like the ""nice girl attitude"" please please please tell me because I never wanna have that attitude but I'm worried that I can't fully assess whether I have it myself?

83,"This is kind of lengthy, but thank you to whoever reads it til the end. I just need to vent. 

My husband and I got married two years ago this September. He's from a primarily Muslim country that is deep rooted in tradition, and is his father's only son. Well... my father in law did not take well to the fact that his son married me, a much less than wealthy American girl, as opposed to the rich and glamorous women from his country they always envisioned him with.

Being his only son, my father in law built a life for my husband. He bought him an apartment in the capital city, cars, and paid all his tuition. My husband was never in need of anything. But when he finished school, he realized he wanted to move to America and build his life here. My FIL refuses to accept this. He also refuses to accept the fact that I'm his daughter in law, and that his son is married to me. He has the idea in his head that my husband is going to just drop me and move home permanently someday... which he isn't. 

What gets to me the most about all this, is his father monitors all his social media activity and harasses him if he even mentions me. One time, someone at a family gathering mentioned a photo they saw that I posted of myself and my husband and he blew up his phone all day. My husband actually ended up not talking to him for a week over it. There are no photos of me on his FB or Instagram, and he doesn't follow or like any of my posts, all to make his father happy. His mother and sister used to follow me but they don't anymore, because of my FIL. The women have accepted and made peace with my husband's decision, and me being his wife. But his father absolutely will not come to terms with it. 

All this makes me feel like I'm being hidden, like I bring shame to my husband's family. It's a very materialistic lifestyle where he's from, and the choices my husband made for himself are considered embarrassing and ridiculous. I've tried understanding their point of view  and making peace with things being quiet but I just can't anymore. I know social media is trivial, but I'm so proud of my husband and love to share our life together. It hurts to know my husband doesn't share anything about me because of his father STILL trying to control his life at twenty eight years old. It's incredibly challenging for my husband because while he loves me, he also loves his father for all the support and everything be provided for him over the years. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I love my husband with all my heart but some parts of marrying into a different culture can be challenging.",16Jun2019,2

88,"My ex roommate (let's call him Donald) was all in all a total PoS against me; I live in a house of 4 roommates, me included. He stole from me, used our past close friendship and my depression as a weapon to abuse me verbally, and spread false rumors on me that are still going around my university. 

My other roommate (Valerie) , also best friend of said douche for the past 8 years, told me that she sides with me completely but never has said anything to him personally, just ignoring anytime he did something to me saying ""she didn't want to get involved because it wasn't about her"".

Valerie remained friends with him, which hurt me pretty bad. I texted her yesterday about how it hurt me that she was still good friends with someone who hurt me so much, even though I understood they had history (she personally speaks badly about him with me, but I'm finding out she has double standards so I just went with it), and wasn't even remotely suggesting she should cut ties, but that I wanted to let her know because bottling up emotions is always a bad thing in relationships. I at least wanted this to be spoken word- and she replied with (translated from Italian) ""IMO,  people should fix their own problems without expecting others to compensate for their insecurities"". Also saying me and him are the same for ""trying to take her to each other's own side"" but frankly I'm appalled this has to be a ""side"" thing. 

He hurt me and confessed to her he was doing it intentionally, manipulated me, tried to manipulate me into breaking up with my girlfriend, and poisoned the newly arrived roommate against me in a way that makes it to this day, so hard for me to even talk to him, since he thinks I'm this kind of terrible person. It's been 6 months since he arrived.   


All my friends from uni said that even though they knew what they were hearing was false, they wouldn't do anything about it (not even disprove it) because ""you just have to let it go, people can form their own opinions and realize the truth"". They really wouldn't care for being slandered across campus, they told me, but it hurt me because they wouldn't stand up for me even though they were saying I was totally right. They even hung out with him a lot until he moved out (and luckily after that, most of my friends except 1 or 2 completely cut him off). 

  
I tried to stand up for myself but in 1 on 1 conversation, there is no way for me to reason with him, he completely shuts me off and treats me like crap, ignores me and just says what he wants to say (we are still talking because money issues on his side. fml) and I think if he got called out on the fact he's being a jerk he'd at least pull back a little, but my two closest friends won't budge either (from college). My best friends from my hometown and High school were completely supportive instead, and tried calling him out but they have no connections to the circle of people I frequent at uni.   


I really just needed to vent about this. I would always stand up for any friend of mine who got treated like I did, at least call them out privately, but nobody ever did in this situation, until one day, when Don was ranting at Valerie about me, when she bursted out saying ""you really are treating him like shit."" and when he replied ""I'm not, he's the a-hole"" she didn't push the conversation further.   


I would accept if my friends told me that they don't want to stand up for me because they don't side with me 100%. I asked my friends at uni *multiple times* if I was in the right doing this, behaving like so, handling each situation like I did, etc. I have ADHD and know my limits, so I wanted to be sure that I wasn't accidentally being the bad guy in this situation. But nobody told me they thought I was wrong, if they did think so, and still decided that even though they sided with me they didn't want to say anything about it.   
I feel like you should always step up when you see someone, especially a friend, get bullied and mistreated, but my friends didn't when I needed it, and I now am starting to grow resentful of people I know would be 100% great people if it weren't for their bystanding.

90,"Tl;dr: my stepfather skipped my baby sister's high school graduation so he could go hand out Bibles in Guatemala and I don't want him in my life anymore. 

. 
. 

I don't want to go see my stepfather today. I'm going to spend the day feeling alternately angry about this social convention and guilty for feeling angry and then being angry that anger isn't the proper response to all of this.

Because my stepfather is not a bad person. He doesn't drink, he doesn't hit my mom, he works hard, he only hit us a handful of times, and he's given me two amazing sisters who routinely forget that my father is dead and I'm a leftover from my mother's previous life.

But he's a delusional person. Burying gold because the government is doing, Idk, government things. Stockpiling guns in bunkers. And talking directly to Jesus. 

My mom went on a date with him when I was 11 and my brother was 9. She didn't hear from him for a month, and then he called my mom and told her Jesus wanted them to get married and he would adopt us so we could all become missionaries and move from state to state every six months building churches in places that already have plenty of fucking churches. 

It's such weird experience, growing up like that. Being forced to honor thy father when the father doesn't even make sense but you have to agree or you'll go to Hell. 

Being woken up in the middle of the night to have family prayer rallies. Having to move to a new school as soon as I'd gotten used to the current one. Staying home from school for a whole month with a fake illness because we'd started studying evolution. Talking all the time about everyone who was going to Hell.

So I grew up and didn't talk to him anymore, and he didn't talk to me. We have nothing to say to each other. I'd see him occasionally by happenchance and we'd have a polite conversation and go our separate ways.

And then last year he skipped out on my baby sister's high school graduation so he could hand out Bibles in Guatemala. He and my mom got into a massive fight about it and he went and got my sister out of school and demanded that she tell Mom it was okay with her if he went to Guatemala instead of her graduation ceremony.

I was - am - fucking furious and I was going to confront him as soon as he was home. But my mom had to have emergency surgery right after he got back, and we had to band together to take care of her, so I kept my thoughts to myself for her sake.

She recovered and I never confronted him and we're back to politely ignoring each other. I ignored him on his birthday last month and nobody said anything about it.

So what now? It's Father's Day and Mom has already told me what time to come over and I'm just supposed to go say ""thanks for being my Dad"" and not add ""you insane piece of shit.""

Or, ""I don't want you in my family because you're such a hard core Christian that we're barely a family anyone""?

When she finally did come back, she kissed me. She said she knew it would help her move on from me.

I cut her out, and then she freaked out. She called me for months, going straight to voicemail. My support system would say ""Yeah- bet she misses ya now!"". I hated it when they said that, because she was probably hurting a lot.

Company A's last year revenue was over $5B
Company B's last year revenue was over $30M

The job at A Co is mostly front end IT and some users support.  Dealing mostly with troubleshooting proprietary application.  No on-call/after hours support.  More of low level management than hand-on technical service, but will need engineering new IT infrastructure in the near future.

The job at B Co is still more users support, but dealing more with back end applications and system support and on-call support.  A lot similar with what my previous job was.  It is a guarantee 4 years contract, but most likely will get put on other projects after 4 years.

Commute distance is the same for both Co.
Salary and benefits are very similar and competitive

I like both jobs and leaning toward B Co. Because it is the job is familiar and it's what I enjoy doing. I know it will help build my technical skill set. On the other hand, I know I will hate the on-call part.  The size of the company is also a small factoring; working for bigger company may bring more stability and chances for career advancement.

-I am going to summer classes at my community college and the work load is the same amount of work in half the time. It was manageable until I started writing 4 papers in a two day span. And then I had to write a paper with inadequate sources and ended up not being able to turn it in because I had nothing to write. I feel like I’m going to fail some of these classes and I just can’t afford that. I already have bad anxiety to deal with. 


-I tried to go to the beach with my family to relax but it ended up doing the opposite and made me more stressed. I was suppose to stay for two days but I ended up leaving the morning after I got there. I got a little tipsy and it reminded me of my sexual trauma and made me feel unsafe (when I was first raped it was because I was intoxicated and half way passed out going in and out of consciousness). 


-I always have nightmares but usually it’s just someone trying to chase to kill me or my family but now it’s going back to someone is trying to rape me. On my dreams I’m used to seeing people dying and dead bodies or something awful. It just feels even more real when someone is trying to rape me in my dreams. I should also explain that in my dreams I feel everything. The physical and emotion pain. 


-Just the other day my boyfriend was going to his friends house and had been gone awhile. I didn’t know he was intoxicated when he left but he was. He ended up totaling the car and didn’t even call me! I called him cause I was worried about him and found out what happened. I immediately drove to him, dropped him off at his friends and acted like I wrecked the car because I didn’t want him to get in trouble. He seems numb to the fact of what he did and now I’m scared since the neighbors of the crash site saw him that I might get charged with something. 


My anxiety is through the roof and this was just this weeks worth of stress. Its scary how I calmly I thought about wrecking my car so I could be in a coma and not deal with all of this or worse. I need help. I feel like I have no one to talk to or to lean on. I don’t like to hurt people so I feel like I’m a human doormat and people take advantage of that. I will accept advice, nice words, or anything helpful. Please, I really don’t know what to do...",16Jun2019,1
107,"So...I'm just going to get to the subject...I have one more year till i have to choose where to go after highschool...what i would do is a foreign languages university(but to be honest it isn't very secure if we are talking about financial security, but it can be) and my parents want me to get into the system...like to become a police officer and things like those, because those jobs can provide me the financial security that they are talking about,but i don't have any interest in what they want me to do.But i also understand their point of view..because they really want to know that i ll  have an easy life.But again what i would really love to do would be to study foreign languages !What should i do guys?",16Jun2019,1
108,"Recently something has come over me where I’ve been lacking motivation to do daily hobbies that have been so common to me; like workout, practice writing, do paper work, etc. 
It just doesn’t feel normal anymore, I try getting myself to focus, but I fall flat not having any motivation to really do it anymore.. which isn’t at all how I use to be. I’m stuck now and don’t exactly know what to do. 
So, I guess my question here is, what do YOU do when you lack motivation and what are your helpful tips?",16Jun2019,2
109,"Jack wasn't mine but I loved him. 

My mom broke the news to me yesterday and i started crying. She's like ""you're crying over a dog??"" 

I cried myself to sleep and she told me ""stop crying that much over a dog, God will get angry and kill someone that is actually close to you (a human)

Today I was talking to a close friend of mine that used to own a dog, so she felt for me. As for everyone else, I am so angry.

My best friend texted me asking me to hang out and i told her I'm not in the mood because my cousin's dog Jack died. She responded ""it's a dog"" 

I can't believe it. Everyone invalidating my feelings because I guess you're not supposed to cry over pets.",16Jun2019,3
110,"The sob just stays lodged in my throat and burning in the pit of my belly ceases to dwindle. I stand here just trying to paint a wall and instead I find myself bawling all over again. Fuck I hate crying. Fuck I hate hurting. Once again I loved someone more then they loved me.  Once again I trusted someone more then I should have. Once again, I’m obliterated. And alone again. I always seem to walk alone. Alone I guess I must be. Life seems to always hate me.",16Jun2019,24
111,"Trigger warning for mentions of sexual abuse of a minor. Don't know how to mark it as nsfw, help? 

Three weeks ago, I went to see my parents back to my hometown. I (23F) don't live with my parents for many reasons - they didn't abuse me, no, they were nice but very protective - but I still make time to see them during weekends.

As I was waiting for bus home, a woman approached me, asking what time it was. So I told her, we kinda began talking, she told me who she was, and I found out she was my old neighbor so I told her my name.

She went pale, looking like she'll faint. So I sat down with her, missed the bus, was just about ready to call the ambulance, when she apologized, then broke down crying.

After an hour or so of us sitting in a park, she told me that her husband was a good friend of our family. I was confused, why would she tell me that? 

Apparently the man had sexually assaulted me when I was four years old.

When he was watching me, he'd touch himself, and she found him fondling me when I was asleep on the porch at the back of our house one day.

Our yards were connected so he could come anytime, and apparently he did. He confessed as such, that it wasn't the first time he touched me.

Divorce followed soon after, but she was so ashamed that she only told my parents a year later. But I was never told anything. The dude died when I was little (lung cancer) and I've never seen her again.

It's been three weeks now, that I was told that as a four year old, my male neighbor had sexually abused me. I don't remember anything, my parents never told me anything, and I just feel so lost. I don't 'think' I need therapy, because I don't remember it happening, or even the man, nothing... 

I just feel lost...",16Jun2019,1
112,"I can’t afford therapy so a long time ago I started combatting my issues through self-analysis. Now I feel like I know everything about myself and it’s maddening. I know what my face looks like from every angle because I take pictures from every angle just to look at my face. Not because I like it. Because I need to see what other people see. One time I recorded myself taking a nap. I’m constantly worried about how other people see me yet I feel pretty confident that people like me and that I am cute or desirable enough to feel good about myself. I need to understand my own being and it bothers me that I can’t see myself from someone else’s point of view. It’s an obsession. I talk to myself in my head frequently and analyze everything I fucking do. I feel like I have no sense of myself at the same time. I feel disconnected. Feels like me and my brain are two different things. I am so tired of caring about myself and looking at myself and talking to myself, but I can’t stop. I realize why I have all my bad habits, but I can’t figure out how to make myself form better ones. It’s like one part of me wants to be successful and productive but the other part wants to sleep and underachieve. I have to fight every day to pick success. I have to literally talk myself into doing good things, and somehow I talk myself into bad things too.  It’s very confusing and I don’t want to be self aware anymore. I really wish I had never put my own consciousness under a microscope. I’m miserable and I’m tired. I want to be stupid.",16Jun2019,16
113,"I used to be very liberal, but now I feel like I lean more conservative on a lot of issues. I think I’m pretty moderate and I don’t support any party or politician at this time, but I used to be far far more left leaning than I am now. 

I used to be a laid back anti-authority type. Now I’m working to be a manager at my workplace and I’m strictly enforcing the rules. I am now calling people out for not following the rules and reporting them to upper management. People there resent me and wonder what my problem is. People there probably see me as “the man”. Something I never thought I would become, but I’m working to build my career so I can build a better life. 

I used to hate country music, but now that’s mostly all I listen to. I never thought I would be into country, but I even like most of the stuff they play on the radio even. I still like rock and appreciate almost all types of music, but I don’t like rap or hip hop anymore. I like the kind of music I used to hate and and I don’t care about a lot of the music I used to like. 

I used to be vehemently anti-religion and never hesitated to call out religious hypocrisy. It was something that almost defined me as a person. Now, I’ll go to church with my grandparents and my girlfriend and I just don’t care. I appreciate religion and see beauty and value in it, even though I still don’t personally believe in it. My girlfriend is Christian and I don’t even care. I actually like that about her for some reason. 

I used to be a major pothead and I drank almost everyday. I thought there was nothing wrong with weed and I’d get high before doing anything. I was high all the time and would argue for weed whenever someone criticized it. Now, I’ve been off of weed for almost 4 months and don’t have any desire to do it. I don’t feel the need to drink when I go out like I used to. I don’t really care about drinking or smoking weed because I find it to be more trouble than it’s worth and they could wind me up in trouble. I used to be into shrooms and LSD but I’ve had my time with them and I don’t care anymore. Glad I did it though and don’t regret any of it, but I don’t see myself doing any of that again. 

I’ve dropped friendships with people who are going nowhere in life. I feel a little bad about it, but I only want to surround myself with people who have goals and ambitions and are not drinking or high all the time. My own father is one of the negative influences I decided to cut out and I don’t regret it. 

I never thought I would become this person but I’m happy with who I am and I’m happy about where my life is headed. I’ve found people who are positive influences and care and support me. I’ve cut negative people out and I didn’t even realize they were negative at the time that they were in my life.",16Jun2019,0
114,"Hey, so I'm getting tired of being Anti-social for so long. This all happen ever since I moved schools as well as moving to a new city in general. This occurred right after 6th grade didn't even get to tell my friends or girlfriend at that time just disappeared from that life almost quite literally because almost nobody who I knew from Elementary and middle school remember me at all when I tried getting in touch with them. In 7th grade I just didn't talk at all, didn't know how to fit in, encountered bullying and getting things stolen by random people. This all went on from 7th grade to the end of highschool I just stopped socializing throughout that whole time, I mean I did made a effort trying to make friends but I'm not good at that. So, here I am I did a semester of college still was anti-social. Currently not doing college just trying to get my life together. I guess you could say I'm depressed which I would agree but that's not what I'm trying to discuss. I just want to know how can I socialize, like I don't know how to get the words out of my mouth I'm just so use to having it shut being quiet the whole time. I don't want to be like this forever, I don't really have any friends or anyone to hangout with.",16Jun2019,1

I’m tired of feeling so much pain for someone that won’t even make me feel half as much love as I’m giving. I’m tried of letting you know about my feelings. I’m tried of you not telling me what happens inside your head. I’m tried of not knowing you anymore. I’m tried of loving someone that doesn’t love me back. I’m tried of living this lie.

116,"The nice guy who flew with a Laudamotion from Vienna to London Stanstade on 10th of June 2019 early morning...

Here is the story: it was an early flight from Vienna to London and I was also late for my check in as a flight attendant. So my day started, i don't want to say 'bad' but different than other days...
Now to the real story, what makes me write here: after we took off and started the service one guy who was sitting on one of front rows took my attention. 
Whenever i passed with the service or west troley he gave me such a sweet smile and made me just think 'oh, what a nice guy' and smile back 
(Am a person who smiles a lot, by nature)

As we reached our final destination, London, my 2 colleague and i were standing at the Aft galley, to say good bye to our passangers 
the nice guy came and start talking to as 'i would like to say thank you for everything... you're all doing a good job... (i don't exactly remember the exact word he said, sorry for that) and then he said ""especially you..."" pointing at me, I was overwhelmed coz it was nothing I expect... he continued ""i saw how you  close the window blinds by yourself, trying not to weak the passangers up...""
This guy didn't just smile back whenever I passed through the isle but was also watching what i was doing 😯....
The only thing I could say was, putting my palms on my cheast ""oh my God, thank you, that's so nice of you""...
Then i don't exactly remember, i might have had a blackout... and then he left
One of my collegues said ""i'd give him my nr.""
The only thing i could say at the end was ""you made my day"" he was already at the stairs...

I came home and regrated I didn't give him my nr or ask for his...

I don't even know if he wanted to have my nr, as he stand at the galley with his phone on his right hand...
Coz this doesn't happen everyday",16Jun2019,1
118,"Not sure I have more to add than that. Every time I see the sub on r/all its just something obviously awful, it's never ""oh shit i feel bad for laughing at that"" cos its dark humour, its just hate on people that don't need it.

119,"Hello,

I've always had pretty bad social anxiety. I never went to school and was kept at home all the time, never interacting with anyone I didn't know. It's bittersweet, but I think my life really started to begin after my grandmother died and I moved in with my mom. I've been going to therapy for about a year now, and just a few days ago, I did something that I could never imagine doing.

My mom was busy that day, so when she couldn't take me to the local community college, my stepfather offered to. We stopped by a Starbucks for breakfast, and I went in and ordered a sandwich and drink by myself. Then, we went to the college. My stepfather followed me as I went back and forth between offices to sort things out. Finally, I went in to take a placement test, and he bade me farewell. I was by myself for the rest of the day.

I scored well on the test; I won't need to take any remedial classes. I then ambled around the campus, waiting for my mom to come get me. I went to the library and picked up a book, Franz Kafka's *The Castle*. I didn't read it all because my mom said she'd be there soon. I went outside the library and sat on a bench in the shade. As I watched people go by and looked at my surroundings, I felt *present*, something I haven't felt in a while.

I'm still awkward with people, and I still feel like I don't belong when I'm on campus. But I really did something amazing that day. A year ago, I would have refused to even try, and if I did try by some miracle, I probably would have had a panic attack at some point.

Despite the progress I'm making, I still feel kind of worthless. I'm twenty three and just now going to *community* college. And going around, doing things on my own? Most people wouldn't give it a second thought. Well, I guess it's pretty good for *me* at least. I should compare myself to where I was instead of where other people are.",16Jun2019,1
120,"Okay so in history we were playing jeopardy just to review for the exam a bit, and we were like playing in groups but in pairs(so for every round two people were playing from opposite teams against each other, idk if that makes sense but ya) so the game was coming to and end and it was almost mine and my partners turn to answer the question. Mind fracking u in every round when it was our(or if someone didn’t know the answer we’d help them too) turn I knew the answer for every question, but I was too shy to actually say it so my partner would always say it out loud for me. My partner is known to be very smart, but she acc didn’t know answers to any of the questions so I just told her what they were and she answered. So anyways it’s almost our turn to go and this fracking b in my class( who literally couldn’t answer any of the questions when it was her turn is like hey, we should switch for the next round, and I was like I don’t think we r gonna go anyways. (Cuz we had like 2 minutes left of class) And she was like oh true. And I was like ya. But like lmao whattt bro?are you dumb? Literally everyone in the class hates her because she’s so fracking annoying and thinks she’s so smart, and is all that j cuz her parents r rich, and at first I was kinda on her side because like everyone hated her, and I was nice to her bc I didn’t want her to feel unwelcomed(?) so I was like k.

124,"I broke up with my fiancee several months ago and since then I've had a smattering of dates which haven't really gone anywhere. I'm on all the dating sites and I rarely get any matches, even fewer messages, and I'm just starting to feel like I'm a worthless person who no one could possibly care about.

I do my best to be an active person, I go the gym every day now, I'm thin and in fairly good health (well as good as one can be with autoimmune problems) and I work on myself mentally and physically. I'm in grad school working on my PhD in a science field which is as good a job as any, but just feels like a strain lately.

I just feel like I'm a fairly whole person with hobbies and goals and it doesn't matter, because I'm short and bald, all the rest of me doesn't matter.

I'm just feeling like I don't matter and I'm never worth anyone's time. And the few people who bother seem to waste my time and move on as soon as someone better (or taller, or more handsome) comes along.

126,Pause the music. Go to the door. I'm annoyed now. No one is there. Made me stop what I was doing and wonder what sales person I would have to tell I'm not interested 10 times in a row.

127,"I've been worse. Much worse. My early twenties was the loneliest time if my life, being out of college and working away in a boring office for 40 hours a week, with very little social interaction. Add onto that a feeling romantically estranged because I'd never had relationship, and all of together is what made me realize I was depressed.

That went on a for a couple years, but eventually I made some changes in my life by deciding to be more proactive in seeking out social situations to meet new people. And then eventually I found a new job that was more interesting and had a more social environment to work in too. And then I struck up a relationship for the first time in my life and felt a great sense of relief and happiness that I'd finally gotten to experience that sort of thing. Eventually it petered out, but a new experience breathed energy into my life, which was buying a house.

Well, now it's been a few months since then, and I feel like I've gone stagnant. I don't do things anymore, it feels like. I've got some new friends I hang out with time to time and I'm glad for that, but I feel like my life lacks a sense of excitement or passion. It used to be creative pursuits like writing or programming, but I've not felt the motivation to work on those sorts of things lately. All in all I've just felt kind of tired, mentally and maybe even physically. I think my diet has gone south and it might be affecting my wellbeing. I also haven't been exercising much but I do bike to work so it's not all bad.

I don't know. I'm not depressed, but my life feels stagnant and I don't know what I want. Everything that could make it more exciting just feels like too much work. I know that comes across as lazy, because it is, but it's not a purposeful laziness. I don't even have the desire to play video games or watch Netflix anymore that much. Maybe I've just fried my brain with the internet and my smartphone too much, and that's why I don't want to do anything. Instant gratification is like a feedback mechanism that constantly requires more to get the same high. End.",16Jun2019,1

129,"Around 3 weeks ago me and my girlfriend had sex, before starting she suggested I just do one or two strokes without protection, and so I did, I wiped my penis on the sheets each time before I put it in to make sure that there was no pre-cum.After that it was standard, just sex with a condom with me pulling out prior to the grand finale (as we usually never go the full way on the inside).Now her period is late for around 10 days, she has had major stress with finals, she is going to be moving to a different country soon too, so that is great stress on it's own and she had rigorous dieting and intermittent fasting for a month that ended around 7 days ago.I am freaking out and wondering how big the chance is for her to be pregnant.(She was also on the medium fertility that day.)

I look for my dad and I see that he’s working outside and I decide that I shouldn’t bother him. So I go back inside and go to the bathroom (also important to note that I have my period and today my stomach decided to be a little bitch). So I’m on the toilet for around an two hours with no toilet paper and I’m just waiting for the cramps to pass and suddenly my family group chat is blowing up. My dad apparently had gone out to a restaurant that we often frequent, I don’t know if he was alone or with someone, and he’s saying that he’s mad that I haven’t gotten up and left my room. I tried to explain that I saw him working so I decided not to bug him and that I’ve been on the toilet because my stomach is all messed up and he says he doesn’t believe me and that I’m lying.

I'm wanting to get into a music course, but I'm not sure whether I'll make the points or if I'll pass my post graduate course. Basically one of our mandatory subjects is Music Theory and Practice and I didn't do that well in the exams. Basically what mandatory subject means is if I don't pass, I get no reward; basically coming out empty handed no matter how well I do in everything else.

I've been wanting to expand my guitar collection so I can play more types of songs, but I didn't get Summer work. Even if I did, my Mum would be insisting that I stash it all away for the future. And okay yes, she does have a point; I can't drive a Gibson to work every morning, just like a Stratocaster isn't a roof over my head. But I feel as though that if she had her way, I'd abandon my dreams and settle as a gardener or a gutter cleaner just to do 'little' favors for her around the house while only living across the road.

This is just a really tense time of the year for me.",16Jun2019,1
142,"Ok so a two part post

1. I feel like we too often think that we made such a big progress as a society and as humans when i honestly think we couldnt be more wrong. We are small and irrelevant to anything, so many of us die from poverty when others drown in money and we cant stop the hate, we can never stop the hate against other people. We’re easily controlled and manipulated, i am not saying i am not and i am some kind of a demigod cause that would be bullshit but i just feel like humanity has such a potential that we just refuse to use.

2. I often wonder why do some people hate me for the fact that i simply exist (i am trans) and i can never find an answer. After all none of them know me, i mean to be fair if they knew me and hated me i wouldnt be that surprised or mad cause i am just a shitty person in general but its not the same with all other people like me. I am scared of my future and i am scared for others and i am scared that it might never end, that the cycle of hate will just keep going on and on forever. I just want people to understand that i am not a mentally ill monster.",16Jun2019,0

145,"  I go to appointments fortnightly with an employment advisor for the past month. I’m a 21 year old quiet guy who’s quiet and nervous and polite. She reminded me the 
interviews she chose me for that I had coming up and she subbed me for both of them (they get job opportunities) and she then talked upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (bubbly) she talked a little bit about it and then said ‘ok do you need interview clothes?' (THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet) ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this accordingly) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s. Just really worried she thinks I'm Ugly and that I stink. I did need a shave which maybe why but I always showered as normal and was clean I just hadn’t shaved this once and had easy wear layabout clothes on :/ she also put in the email ‘please dress smartly’ underlined.

148,"WARNING: (this is my first post to of this type ever , and i'm not good at writing so please excuse any errors or if the story gets ""loose"" i'm in an emotional state at the time of writing) 

&amp;#x200B;

so let's start with a little about yours truly , strap in this is a long one. at first glance i'm quite normal , or maybe a little above average when it comes to most things like school and other stuff that define people on the surface , even tho it wasn't always like this , i used to pour soul sweat and tears into everything ... so let's explain that first ... this tangent is about how i lost interest in life all around ... it all bloomed from my youth , because the way i am , always trying to please people and such. you can easily see how naive I've brewed over the years. at the start i was the typical skinny smart kid , people didn't like that so i became the sour sweet careless dude, once again to change, this time into a blissful happy dude who is sportive and determined. although through all my changes i was always empty on the inside i never truly felt much i thought it was normal , I learned it wasn't , and i was reminded how painfully conscious i was about everything around me and not inside me when my parents mirage finally gave in. it was the first time i ever felt something ... and that something was ... well, pain , and so much of it. yet I never harmed myself , not because I was stopping for my sake ... I was stopping because i was thinking of how the people around me would think or feel about it ... ""the show must go on after all"" ... or so do they say , and they where right , it did go on. a while after everything happened I started self destructing ... from the inside out ... and because i didn't want  anyone to see or care ... I've unconsciously developed harmful habits of thinking including a very bad case of overthinking ... which gave me a highly powerful thinking power but the positive parts of this story don't matter ... they didn't change a thing after all. fast foreword a little over 7 months ago when  one of my only friends who was in a similar situation started doing drugs to kill his ""demons"" , to dumb himself to the point where he wont be able to make ""our"" thinking mistakes ever again , forgot to mention me and him are really smart ,like really really smart , i simply forgot to say that because not only that it doesn't help us at all because neither me or him are looking for an academic career or to revolutionize anything  but we are sick of it , let me tell you the combination of being a being a psycho and smart but keeping it all to yourself because you are still hoping for the possibility of a normal life that is hanging from a thread  hurts ... actually i think back then pain was the only thing I've ever felt , anyway he had the balls of killing his curse , and then he betrayed me for 300$ so there's 7 years down the drain... after he left my life i had no one to relate to anymore so it got empty and lonely fast...but the odd ball this time was that i moved schools and met the person who may actually save me.. so this guy i met at the new school D. , one day told me about his discord server ... at this point I've decided i'm going to probably off myself at the end of this summer so  I tried to be open minded and i joined ... boy oh boy i didn't know what i was in for ...  right after a few days ... on a weekend when outside was quiet i joined a channel ... and i proposed to the people on the channel to play some d&amp;d ... I've never played it  before but I saw this animated video from danplan of them playing it their way and i wanted to try the same thing with these people. I was the so called dungeon master and slowly as the game unfolded someone started sticking out ...  i bet you all 3 people reading this are rolling your eyes  to the idea of what i'm about to say ... yeah people... that night ... its the night i met her ... no matter what complicated ruins i make up she solves them exactly how i solve them ... she mirrors me perfectly so ... after the game ended and people started leaving i proposed to her we talk the next day ... and so we did ... that first fantasy like night ... we talked for 8 hours straight we where so similar it was scary... and so I've lifted my usual personality of staying closed to people ... and so did she ... the next night we talked 9 hours ... and dammit a fool i was ... this was the first time in my life I've ever started developing actual feelings for someone and now i knew the second feeling i ever felt... love .. then i found happiness , soon gratefulness , kindness , appreciation ,  and everything else ... when i was with her i felt ... for the first time I've felt ... i was crying each time we talked but i didn't make a noise... there where always tears running down my cheeks but no sobbing no voice getting squeakier , nothing , just smiling and crying ... and then an event came around and we met for the first time because she was in England and i was not ... and after the first day of the event when she came back to her hometown , to our hometown I've told her how i felt ... what a fool i was and still am ... she told me that its not that she doesn't feel the same way but that she has a crush on someone ... and i believed her ... but now i think i realize why she told me that ... and why it sounded so weird to me seeing that she spends more time with me then sleeping ... with the help of my friends i came to the conclusion she didn't want to make any attachment before we could be in the same city and guess what ... now shes moving back from England , back to my town ... and i plan on spending the summer with her , we made plans and all, ill tell her how i feel once more , unfortunately i don't think i could keep it together much longer without her so its decided ... ill give it my all and if i fail ill end this pain i'm living in... if i win ill use everything in my power to live to strive for greatness because until now I've barely survived... there are many parts of this tale that are missing ... but for the first time in all my life...  I WANT TO LIVE to love and spread love around me ... this is the only way I will continue my life ... if anyone cares enough ask me anything about this tale of mine , but this is all the time i have today

149,"I was recently dumped by my boyfriend completely out of the blue so I’m going through a really hard time at the minute. I’ve noticed when I look at photos of me or even my reflection in the mirror it doesn’t look like me anymore. It’s frightening me

Yesterday it made me cry because it really feels like I’m looking at somebody else. I’ve lost a lot of weight very quickly (thanks break up diet!) so I guess it could be made worse by the fact I actually probably look a bit different, but will this go away?

I look at old photos of me (even recent ones that happened before the breakup so as recently as 2 weeks ago) and it’s like I’m looking at photos of someone I’ve never seen before

151,"Amazing is an understatement. I can't even describe how it feels to be with my girlfriend(17) in words. It's just wholesome love and I want to be with her and hold her in my arms and make her feel safe forever. I'll update this later because there's so much more I have to say, but I just couldn't wait any longer to make a post(I've been procrastinating this lol). I didn't think I'd be able to fall in real, pure, unconditional love in high school but here I am.

It's just the spirit of personal growing reflecting on my brain and creating a feeling of good vibes and positive energy that I wanted to share with you.

157,"Last year in the summer I met a girl in London while we were both staying there for a month. I almost immediately fell in love with her and we spent every single day of that month together. Unfortunately we both had to go home, she to Germany and I to the Netherlands. We visited each other and video called weekly to stay in touch. In October she went to the other side of the world but we still called a whole lot. At some point I finally told her how I felt but she told me she liked me but she wasn't ready for a relationship since she had sort of recently gotten out of one. We still stayed in touch and she even came over to my place in March to spend some time together. In April she left to Tanzania for 3 months and is without internet there so it's hard to call her and I miss her a whole lot. Fast forward to last Saturday and I get a call from her at a horrible time but I picked up anyway since I hadn't properly talked to her in a while. During the phonecall she proceeds to tell me that she has been seeing someone over there and that they are in a committed relationship. I'm completely heartbroken by it and I cannot do anything but lay in bed and cry. I'm completely lost as what to do since all I can do is cry. Is there any way to stop the crying and feel something else even for just one second?",16Jun2019,4
