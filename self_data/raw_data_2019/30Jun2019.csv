0,"Hes been my friend for 9+ yrs and I've never had any other friends, I just hope he remains my friend, we havent talked in a while, and it's probably just me overreacting out of panic that I'm gonna lose my only friend.",30Jun2019,1
1," I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven‚Äôt talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  üëî  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‚Äòyou make me sweat, Graham‚Äô and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‚Äòwtf‚Äô she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt got a boyfriend you know, Graham‚Äô I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",30Jun2019,1
2,i wonder if it feels nice for guys though cause i know a few who think that‚Äôs ‚Äúemasculating‚Äù or something. either way this is probably just because it‚Äôs 2am and i‚Äôm lonely lmao but the argument stands and physical affection is dope,30Jun2019,8

4,"When my grandmother started to get really bad and basically lose her senses and start to die, we got her a dog to keep her company, shortly after which my grandmother died. Well, the dog is eerily very much like my grandmother. Same personality, same eyes, same aura. And my grandmother used to be obsessed with pigs, and my dog oinks like a pig. And just any time I hang out with my dog, it just feels... familiar. And it's not a bad thing don't get me wrong. I love my grandmother and my dog, but sometimes their similarities and their similar vibes/auras make me feel like they could be the same soul maybe. Idk.",30Jun2019,2

7,"All I do is worry, overthink, and assume the worst. It is really exhausting always overanalyzing things, and thinking that everyone is out to hurt me. I really need to learn how to process my feelings better instead of bottling everything up inside of me, but I also need to learn when something actually needs to be brought up, or if I'm just overthinking and letting bad thoughts linger for too long. There are so many things on my mind that I want to address outloud, but I feel ashamed of my own feelings, and feel like it's only going to make things worse. I'm tired of feeling like I'm a handful to deal with, but I'm also tired of people not fully understanding my worries and concerns even though they claim they do. I'm just exhausted. 

Overall I'm ""okay"", but I really just needed a place to rant really quickly and get this off of my chest because I'm having a rough evening.",30Jun2019,1
8,"I want to clarify on the friend part. We used to hangout a lot when we were in the same classes and we were like best friends. The next year we didn't have any classes together and we didn't exchange phone numbers when we were in the same classes. So we never talked. He never told me that he was homophobic and he started talking to people about it this year. I didn't know that he was homophobic until the end of the year. I really don't want to be his friend but every time I have encountered him he has been very nice to me. I just think that if I did come out to him he wouldn't be my friend anymore. I don't feel betrayed or offended at all because we were once best friends, and I still want us to be on good terms.",30Jun2019,1
9,"First of all I don't even know why subway has a tip option now, but I know most places do nowadays even if everything is self serve. 

So my family and I got about $25 worth of subs and we were going to pay, my father (we were all born outside of America, but we are citizens now and have been here for 21 years, though my dad's English comprehension is not the best) asked the male subway clerk what a certain screen said - I saw the screen briefly, it was the tip screen - and he did not even say what it was, so give me or him a real chance to look at it, the clerk just immediately clicked the ""20 % tip"" option. Then the receipt printed off and I asked the clerk what this was about? The tip amount said $4.99 and was clearly labeled 'tip' on the recipient. 

He claimed my dad clicked it but I said no, I personally saw the clerk immediately click it before either my dad or I had a chance to react. Then he said he cannot do a refund. Then the clerk claimed I was holding up the line (of like two other people in the store after us.) Then he finally said he can give us a free sandwich, but still no refund. I wonder if he could have done the refund but just did not want to since what if any tips went to him directly? What if he did that to other unsuspecting customers? It all happened so fast that no one in my family expect me caught it, but I have zero tolerance of being scammed. My dad said to just let it go but I said no. 

I know some places can be scammy, but I did not expect it to be at a Subway chain of all places. 

I usually don't complain about things like this online, but it's beyond unbelievable and it's utterly ridiculous that this happened in the first place. I thought about calling their corporate number if they have one, but I work in a call center myself and I know all about the phone maze, long hold times, and no one caring about the customer.",30Jun2019,1
10,"So, I‚Äôm going to be looking into getting weight loss surgery in the near future.  It is certainly the best choice I can make for my own physical health.  It has occurred to me, though, that once I have the body that I want/need, I will become very promiscuous because of my mental illness and need for attention and validation.  (That being said, I know that if I am in a relationship, I will stay loyal.)  I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm going to let this end up ruining my life - either by pregnancy, STD, or sexual assault.  Plus, it‚Äôll probably ruin my self esteem all over again when I have sex with guys who don‚Äôt even want me.  I‚Äôm going to need to really check myself once that can start happening, but I‚Äôm not very good that that.  I don‚Äôt know who to ask for support for this matter, either",30Jun2019,1

13,"Recently going through a breakup so the fear of being alone and not finding someone I can connect with has been legit. Although today at work somehow I got through my own self concious behavior and just truly acted like myself. I ended up having genuine conversations and genuine belly laughs with the co worker I worked with all day. 

It feels great to know theres actually people out there I can truly connect with like that. Everyone needs some true level of interaction from time to time in this world.

If you struggle like I do. Just go for it. Dont half heartedly be yourself because your afraid. Just do it. Shia LaBeouf style. Thats the only way youll find those you truly vibe with.",30Jun2019,1
14,"I allow myself to think I have a few good ideas, words that could be put on paper, a sense of people, rythem, wit, whatever, everyone believes that about themselves. There's no idea I have or ever had that someone else hasn't expressed better. And I'm not getting any smarter or more creative. 

""And I tell myself that I have no regrets and my desicions were right because I'm scared that I do""

I have to apologize to the world for missing out on what I could've been. What  a pretentious thing to say, right?

Ever feel cool after listening to a nifty song? That's me, telling myself I could've been something when every choice I knowingly made led me here, alone, fruitless.

Use me as a bad example, maybe.",30Jun2019,1
16,"Before you ask, yes I did get their permission beforehand, yes they knew what they were doing, and no, I didn‚Äôt keep any footage for personal use. TLDR at the bottom

So at my college there is this club that‚Äôs like robotics and programming and computer thingy all sorts of stuff. They had smashed and rebuilt so many things it was like they were masters at their craft. I visit frequently because I have friends in there and I‚Äôm genuinely interested in what they do.

Three weeks before this competition they had, they were starting to get paranoid of competitors spying on their trade because the contest was held on our campus. They even kicked me out a few times because they worried if I could be trusted. Makes sense in a competition.

One day when I went to check it out, one of the members found a small camera in their lab that was live-streaming. It wasn‚Äôt much bigger than a cell phone, but it was very noticeable, and that‚Äôs when I said something.

‚ÄúYou know they‚Äôre just fucking with you, right? If they actually wanted to spy, they could probably do better.‚Äù

They all called me out saying they know their lab way too well, so it would be impossible to hide any spy device in there without being detected. I challenged them to a bet, they agreed, if I won, they all paid me $40 (ten members), and if they won, then I would donate $400 to the club.

The rules were simple: if they found everything I hid (5 devices) in the amount of time their meeting took (1 hour 30 minutes) then they won. If they couldn‚Äôt find one, then I won. I couldn‚Äôt bust a hole in the wall and I couldn‚Äôt destroy something else to hide it. They were to also say a code word and hold up a certain amount of fingers to probe these devices actually worked and I wasn‚Äôt bullshitting.

The next meeting came around, and 10 minutes before they started, I went to work. I hid all five in ways you couldn‚Äôt believe, and one of my friends who was in the club watched me to make sure I didn‚Äôt break any rules. He was neutral so he couldn‚Äôt say anything during the meetings other than ‚Äúdon‚Äôt break it‚Äù

I leave, they do their meeting, and I wait. Time passes, and I get a text saying the meeting is over. I walk in and the club is pissed the fuck off. Two of my spy devices were on the table, and they couldn‚Äôt find the other three, so I immediately pulled out my phone and listened for the code word.

‚ÄúYour code word was ‚ÄòPurple Pickle Peanuts‚Äô and you held up seven fingers.‚Äù

They were absolutely dumbfounded. They started asking so many questions, so I explained them all. The two they found were a micro camera and a little audio bug. I hid the camera inside one of their unfinished robots, but without damaging or breaking anything. The audio bug was hidden in a small flower decoration in the center of their table.

After talking to them about the two they found, I went to point out the three they missed, and I wish I took a photo of their faces because it was like they just watched their loved ones walk out of the grave to see them. One of the devices was a pen with a camera hidden in it. I put it in the cup full of pens they had, and one person actually used it to write something down. The second was a camera that was disguised to look like a shirt button. That one I hid on a hanging coat on their rack, and it recorded the entire table talking and giving hand motions and their sweep throughout the room,

The last one, and I love this one so much, was a wall cube that had a camera hidden in it. Someone from the club plugged their phone into it to charge, but never noticed it at all. After showing all the hidden cameras, I had two things happen. One, I was rich, and two, that group became so fucking paranoid the last few weeks before the competition.

Tl;dr - Robot group found camera recording them, I told them I could do better, and I won the bet with hidden cameras",30Jun2019,4
17,"She‚Äôs moving 200 miles north in a couple weeks because of an amazing job. When she had the interview, she didn‚Äôt expect to get it. But I had a strong feeling she would. It‚Äôs too perfect for her to turn down. 

A significant amount of my free time is spent with her. I don‚Äôt really have any other friends that I ever hang out with. The other people I know are at/from work.  Being coworkers seems to make it a different kind/category of friendship. It‚Äôs hard for me to merge them into my personal life category... even though that category is pretty much empty.  Fortunately, I didn‚Äôt lose any friends because of her presence. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt really know how to look for new friends.  

She‚Äôs extraordinarily special to me. She challenges me when I‚Äôm being an idiot, she supports me when I‚Äôm down, she even was there for my son when he was hospitalized for depression. (He‚Äôs better now.)  She‚Äôs kind, thoughtful, beautiful, and even a sex partner. I‚Äôm going to miss everything about her. 

The drive would be about 3.5 hours from my house. So it‚Äôs obviously very commutable. I have intentions to drive to see her every other weekend. But... it‚Äôs just not going to be the same. She‚Äôs still a text message away every day, but the ability to see each other whenever we want is completely gone now. I can‚Äôt consider moving at least until my son is done with high school (another year), but I seriously want to. In fact, another old friend of 20 years lives in the same city. I feel like I should be there, too. 

I‚Äôm really very nervous. The structure of my days, weekends, are going to be very uncomfortably different now.  Being sad really sucks.",30Jun2019,1
18,"I‚Äôve always been a skinny guy, and no matter how much shit I‚Äôd eat I‚Äôd stay the same. That was until I got to college. I gained the freshman 15, but it actually made me look more normal. My school‚Äôs food was horrible and there weren‚Äôt options, so for a while I was eating unhealthy food. I never made time for the gym and by the end of the year I wasn‚Äôt feeling the best about my body. Not bad looking but I could tell I hadn‚Äôt exercised enough. I got home and things got so much worse. I definitely have an addiction problem with stuff like soda and fast food. I know it‚Äôs horrible for me but it‚Äôs easy.

I also started a new job that stressed me out and made me unmotivated to go work out. I finally made the effort around a week ago and renewed my gym membership. I‚Äôve gone a few times and have been trying to get into a schedule. I still just feel gross when I look at myself in the mirror now though. I‚Äôm definitely not overweight or fat. I‚Äôm still skinny for the most part and it wouldn‚Äôt be super noticeable with a shirt on. I‚Äôm probably around 145-150 pounds. Without a shirt though, I hate how I look. I‚Äôve developed small man boobs and I can tell that my stomach is way bigger than it ever was. Any ‚Äúabs‚Äù I may have had do not exist. 

I know exercising will help, but I still have motivation issues and I keep having this fear that I will always look like this. There are people in my family who were in a similar boat as me and ended up with weight issues. This is not to shame anyone with weight issues by the way. I just don‚Äôt like how I‚Äôve let myself go in a way.",30Jun2019,2
19,I just am. He drives me crazy. He doesn‚Äôt do enough chores. But he stimulates my mind. He makes the best burgers. He is so kind and genuine. We argue politics and it turns me on. He‚Äôs skinny and balding but I‚Äôm so attracted to him. He inspires me to be a better person.,30Jun2019,399
20,"I (male, late 20s), quickly became friends with this girl who moved here for half a year and is moving back to her country in less than two days.

In these few months I clicked with her, and were she to live here I know I'd be good friends with her forever.

I have said final goodbyes before and they hurt. Each time I had a heavy heart for a couple of days, sad and forlorn. 

The final hug always shreds the soul, and walking away for the last time is not something I like doing.

She assumes I'll come and pick up a couple of non-important items I forgot at this place where she'll happen to be in a couple of hours, which incidentally will also be the last time I'll see her and thus where we say our farewells.

I've decided to tell her I overslept due to exhaustion. 

Easier to lie in bed on this Sunday morning, feeling sad and forlorn for a couple days than deal with the last look of sadness on her face as we part ways forever, her existence only a memory locked in my head.",30Jun2019,1
23,"I work at a crappy little restaurant. More specifically, I'm the manager of a food truck that the crappy little restaurant launched, and I stop by the restaurant most days for supplies. I've known a girl we'll call Hailey since I started there almost a year ago. I've had a connection with her since the beginning, and I've been realizing recently that she's had an upbringing that has been troubled by a toxic parent in a similar way to how mine was.

This morning, I was at the restaurant scooping ice from the ice machines into trash bags to take with me to the food truck. She was bagging cookies and mentioned that she will turn 18 in a few days and her confrontational mom, whom I've heard about in the past, has been talking about kicking her out.

Without hesitation or really even thinking about it, I told her that some parents like to flaunt that power once they get the chance and that all that would likely happen is that she would stay at a friend's house for a night before coming back. It had happened to me around her age, though for a little more than a night.

I realized as I carried the bag of ice over my shoulder out the door that I had likely been the only person in her life able to share that experience with her, and I did it almost without thinking while I dealt with the issues of the next phase of life. It was cool. It felt like my past was worth something all of a sudden.",30Jun2019,6
24,"There's good times. The only ones I really remember nowadays are bad ones. I used to enjoy spending time with him and talking. Lately there's nothing here to look forward to. He texts other girls religiously, he's immature, he doesn't know how to do anything on his own. I've tried to teach him, but he's a lost cause. I've tried to leave him, but I'm afraid to be alone and so is he. He mocks me saying I'm ""poor"" for not having air conditioning on every single day. He tells other girls he's going to break up with me so he can get into their pants. He makes me feel like shit about myself every time I see him and hangout with him. I don't even enjoy waking up in the morning and have trouble falling asleep at night which causes him to complain about me ""sleeping until 3pm every day"" which isn't true. He complains every time I'm with him and embellishes his stories. 

Yesterday was my birthday, and I wished I was dead. 

He makes me scared to leave because im afraid every guy I meet is going to do this to me. At this point I have nothing to look forward to in life anymore.",30Jun2019,5
25,"I don't know where to put this. Not sure if anyone will read this but I think it may help, Idk how but eh. I'm a 17 year old piece of crap and I think I'm no longer afraid of death.

I've struggled with depression for a while but no seems to really care, which is fine. I have tried to get help and my parents took me to a therapist and I did that for a while but then one day when I was honest about how much I wanted to die, they just sent me to a mental hospital. I don't even know what the point of that was lmao. I just sat in a room with 2 other guys and was let out into this larger room where we did lame crap like coloring, word searches, watch movies and they would let us out for like 20 minutes a day. The showers were awful, I couldn't fucking sleep because of one girl having some sort of schizophrenic attack and was punching and kicking the walls and around 7 nurses tried to get her to calm down, I was scared because we could hear the older inmates, and one dude would not stop snoring, it was so loud oh and how could i forget the nurses coming in opening the loud ass door and shining a flashlight in our faces every 15 minutes all night. I'm not even exaggerating, that's part of their job lol. I was stuck there for like 4 days and I have no idea what that was supposed to accomplish.

When I came back I just acted like I was cured because I did not want to get sent back there ever again and everyone seems to buy it so, cool. I forget if this happened after I was hospitalized or before but I made someone a Valentines Day card but he told me straight and we stopped talking to each other. I felt like an idiot because I'd rather just have been his friend instead of getting into a relationship with him. I didn't even like him that much tbh. I've never really had a crush on anyone actually. I find guys attractive but I never met someone that I've liked personality wise. Everytime I think about not killing myself, I think ""I'll get a boyfriend one day"". But I don't see the point in that. I hate spending time with others. I don't really even have friends. I keep making ""friends"" and then they talk to me too much and I get annoyed and ignore them, then when I'm alone I'm sad. Its like I can't ever be happy.

I see other people hanging out with each other and it makes me realize how lame I am. As I type this, everyone I know in my city, my family, people from my school, the guy I gave the card to are all at this festival thing that my city is holding. They're gonna have a firework show or something tonight I think. And I'm at home. Playing Star Wars Battlefront 2, a game that no one liked and no one plays. This is all I ever do. Sit around and go on reddit and spend an hour deciding what game to play and then realize that all my games are boring and just settle on SWBF 2. Other people do stuff during the summer and I don't, I feel like I can't. This is the summer before I go to college and everyone is living it up and travelling, getting into relationships, doing fun things and I wish I could be happy like them.

I have nothing to live for. I don't want to go to college to learn computer science which I know nothing about, I don't want to get into a relationship, I don't want to do anything really, I just want to pass away. My life is so boring and I constantly feel tired, horrible and I've always been apathetic about everything.

But, I'm finally getting my chance. I am going to New York in early July and I'm 50/50 on if I should jump off of a building. Jumping is my preferred way to die just cause it seems like a fast death. Not sure if I'll even get the chance tho. Do the hotels there have balconies, or do any of the buildings just let you walk up the stairs to the very top? No idea, but I guess I'll find out.

If I do die, my last words will be... ""#BRINGBACKTHENATIONALDEX""",30Jun2019,1

28,"Over the past few years, I‚Äôve made music a part of who I am. It started with guitar, then I started singing. It‚Äôs not that the people in my life don‚Äôt know about my music, but I can‚Äôt bring myself to share it with them like I want to. When I record something, It‚Äôs coming from the deepest part of me and it‚Äôs incredibly vulnerable, especially if i wrote the song. And I know many people who are musically talented, but they shove it down people‚Äôs throats and they are constantly posing videos and sending people things to the point where those people don‚Äôt care and become annoyed. My biggest fear is that when I start showing people who are close to me my music, that they will become annoyed by it and not actually care. And if I knew they didn‚Äôt care, it would really hurt because it‚Äôs a big part of me. But I want people to hear it, just not people I know.

At such a young age, she is treated like a queen. All around, the perfect life.



Then there is me.


I'm a dude, who no one cares for. I'm introverted, but at the same time would like to have some support and love from others. I want friends. I was an outcast in my town because I got bullied as a kid which made me keep to myself because I thought I would end up getting hurt even more. I don't talk to a lot of people, I have anxiety, and there aren't a lot of people that are here for me. A lot of my friends have left me because they only want to be around people who they can leech off of. You know, I wish I had her life. Validation. Love. Support. Stuff she probably takes for granted while I dwell on whether or not I will ever have that one day.

33,"The US is pretty messed up. To the rest of the world we are pretty much bullies who get whatever we want and our people are uncivilized and stupid. I wouldn‚Äôt disagree.

On to the more anecdotal side, I visited San Francisco for the first time today. I was surprised at first by the number of homeless people, but given the high cost of living in the city and the government that couldn‚Äôt care less about its people, I wasn‚Äôt too surprised. This makes me pretty unhappy, because I wish I could afford to help them all, give each and every one of them my change, or buy them a lunch. But then I realized it isn‚Äôt my job to help them. It‚Äôs the government‚Äôs. If Iran for president, I would be Russian to fix all of our own problems before China deal with other countries. (Apologies for the wordplay, I needed some comedy relief.) We have the largest economy, strongest military, most allies, and the spot as one of the two most powerful countries in the world, Russia being a close call. And yet we can‚Äôt even help our own citizens find jobs and get paid enough to live on. We can‚Äôt even accept climate change and work to fight it. We can‚Äôt even have acceptable train infrastructure. All this because the billionaires won‚Äôt spend their money on anything that won‚Äôt make them richer. And ‚Äî fun fact ‚Äî owning the government and making laws that benefits them makes them richer. 

Here‚Äôs where it gets a little crazy.

I propose that the higher your income is, the more taxes you pay. Now, you might say that law is already in place, and it is. Now notice how I say ‚Äúpay‚Äù and not ‚Äúare billed with‚Äù because no one making huge amounts of money pays taxes. If there weren‚Äôt loopholes and corruption, our government might have enough money to actually have infrastructure, rather than million dollar student loans, dying subways in major cities, homelessness, and close to zero emission laws. 

Otherwise...

I propose the guillotine for all making above $5 million a year. But preferably we could fix our problems without a revolution.

38,"But my living situation has become abusive-- and is edging on the extreme even in THAT. I Was supposed to have an apartment open to me-- the guy lied through his teeth. I had already decided that come rent day-- come what may-- I'm hitting the sidewalk. Probably sleeping on it for the foreseeable future. Under another bout of unprovoked abuse-- I was told to be gone at exactly midnight-- and since homelessness knows no schedule-- I said ""See ya."" So tomorrow at midnight-- if I'm not held against my will (these people are crazy enough to do more than that, trust me), I leave loads of fairly expensive stuff behind and hit the streets with the clothes on my back and nothing else-- for who the hell even knows how long. I'm in my thirties, but due to a mix of mild disorders and genuinely never being taught anything beyond ""wash your ass, kid!"" I have no actual way to do anything myself. I have one or two people I've only fairly recently met that are at least TRYING to find me a place-- but the sure bet turned out to be a lie. I've lived homeless before when I was ten-- but as bad as they were, I at least had people around. Like I said-- man in his thirties here, no skills-- and say what you want about it, It don't change facts-- It happens tomorrow and I am about to either break down crying (I must not do that in front of these people) or drop my guts out my ass-- but the ironic thing is, by doing it with or without resources-- I'm making the only possible ""mature"" decision. I've lived with people like these off and on throughout life, I know what it wants to eventually come to-- and it will not happen to me again as a grown man. My only choice is a double edged sword-- but not taking it is a bad end guaranteed.",30Jun2019,1

And then I realized that I was so focused on looking for Mr. Right that I was blinding myself from actually just getting to know someone, casually.

It wasn't until I met my friend who is older than I am and always gives me advice that I greatly appreciate that I had to be ~casual~. He always says don't get too caught up in your feelings, just be cool. And just like that it was like the clouds cleared up and I can see the pretty blue sky and feel the warmth of the sun.

50,"Lets start this with an embrassing confession. I like watching romcoms. And sometimes when they have those big emotional moments where they confess their feelings for each other, it makes me teary eyed.
I want someone I can be best friends with. To have a lot of inside jokes, travel together, go on adventures, do charitable things when we're old, and get frozen in a cryogenic unit when we die, to potentially get resurrected in 1000 years, and still want to be together. (See why it was a bad idea to read this? I'm crazy.)
I'm a software developer. I dream of having my own startup one day (and I'm working on a couple of ideas with a friend these days). I dropped out of school  when I was 16, taught myself to code, moved out at 17, and have been doing that since. However last year after figuring out I had ADHD and getting on medication, I've started studying again while also working. Yay,  doing SATs at 30.
I also had a failed career as a wannabe chef from when I was 18 - 19.
I have a neck tattoo and plan on getting a lot more. Travel, and experiencing other culture is my jaaaam. I know a little Spanish and actively working on learning more. Love reading books, and binging Netflix. GoT WAS my fav show until last season. Fuck D&amp;D.
I'm a lacto-vegetarian and working towards being a vegan. I'd love to meet someone like-minded but its not a requirement, as long as you're supportive.
I'm also childfree - I NEVER want to have kids and plan on getting a vasectomy ASAP. If you're a breeder, sayonara.
I love nerdy girls. Long hair and glasses is the sexiest thing in the world. If you're wearing glasses, I'll be automatically attracted to you even if the rest of your body looks like a hairy ape's.
Here's me: https://imgur.com/a/PSHUXzy

I don't know if they did it on purpose, to make me and my partner uncomfortable (we never do anything that could make them uncomfortable when they are home, and they tell me they are happy with her being home), or they didn't know we were there, which is hard to believe.

77,"This is in contrast with what we used to derive our sense of value from - a future you‚Äôve sacrificed for to be a contributive member of your family, community and nation.

I know I know ... people have been talking about the collapse of civilisation for various reasons having something to do with the degeneracy of youth. But, civilisations do collapse, and never before has a civilisations way of life changed so drastically given the rise of technology, the internet, and social media.

There was a quote from the rules of the 1994 tabletop game Cyberpunk I read recently that chilled me to the core in its seeming prophetic accuracy:

Diversity and Unity

It is now accepted among historical scholars that in the decades before the Collapse, America suffered from the sickness of racism and ‚Äúcultural identity.‚Äù Everyone wanted to be seen as special. 

Every group had to be ‚Äúequal‚Äù to or preferably better than its neighbors, and fought to protect its ‚Äúspecial‚Äù rights. If anyone had something that someone else wanted, they were painted as racist, sexist, elitist, or worse. 

This divisive ‚Äúme first‚Äù attitude eventually tore the fabric of American culture apart and caused it to self-destruct in a fireball of competing ideologies, none of which truly recognized each other‚Äôs validity. Diversity led inexorably to anarchy.

Personally the only thing I see as worthy of getting behind and sacrificing for is my partner and future family, but I am aware that getting behind things on this small scale is on decline, people are choosing not to get married, to not have children because they don‚Äôt want to sacrifice their own opportunities for experience and pleasure, and even those who don‚Äôt want to commit to monogamous relationships because they don‚Äôt want to sacrifice the opportunity for novelty in their own relationships.

The contradiction for me is I believe totally that people should be free to do whatever they want, as long as it doesn‚Äôt harm anyone else. But, the meta conclusion I‚Äôve come to is that without any sort of social pressure to sacrifice your own opportunities for temporary pleasure and novelty in service of something bigger may well be unravelling the broader fabric of society.",30Jun2019,3
78,"I've had a crappy, $8 an hour job for the past two weeks. I have worked at about 15-20 jobs in my lifetime. All of them have been utter failures, and they have been because of a mixture of factors -- abusive bosses, my incompetence, my inability to tolerate being abused, exploitative practices of various kinds. This job that I am about to quit or be fired from tomorrow, was a job I took on after getting to know some of the folks who worked there. The first week, everything seemed perfect. It was a job I was VERY good at, the atmosphere was laid back, everybody was chill -- until this past week, when I discovered that the supervisor has a nasty habit of taking out her emotions on the workers. I allowed her to do the same to me with no consequence for the sake of staying on and keeping a paycheck, but over the week I realized the obviousness of the truth: that I am never going to get off of this cycle of quickly getting hired and quickly quitting or getting fired from jobs, that I am never going to be gainfully employed at any place for any reasonable period of time, and that this is not just because of me, it is because of the simple nature of work itself, and the inequalities it creates. And in so doing, I realized another truth: that the only way I or anyone can survive in society is to subordinate yourself and to capitulate to the abusive whims of others, against everything that we've been taught about morality and decency and justice, and that this is fundamentally all society is about. And because I am incapable of doing that, I am incapable of surviving here, and I must either leave or die.

And I am still devastated at that fact. I am devastated at the fact that I failed at life. I \*failed,\* irreversibly, utterly and completely, and I am, by my nature, a failure. 

I am figuring out how I'm going to raise the money to buy some cheap, undeveloped land in the middle of nowhere that I can develop into a farm so I can provide my basic needs and at least survive for the next 20-30 years.

85,"This is the story of the only time I have found myself in love and probably the only time I will. At this point I wanted to tell my story so other guys don‚Äôt make the same mistake. 


I was a sophomore in high school in a pretty middle-high class area, I was more middle but had a taste of higher up things from time to time, but most of my friends were in the nice gated communities and had the reeeaalll good shit( this is important later). Anyways I wasn‚Äôt the most popular guy, but was known probably due to being a class clown type guy who was joking about anything and always smiling and laughing. Well on about the first week back from winter break we had gotten a new students and she was placed in my home room. Her name was Mackenzie and when I first looked at her I had done that stupid gulp thing with a few friends I had in my class. Now again not the most popular guy but I did well with girls as I‚Äôm not ugly and again pretty easy to talk to. So with my friends I talk like a douchebag guy I was and say ‚Äúboys she is the next girl I get with‚Äù. We laugh and proceed to take our seats, when the bell rang she proceeds to introduce herself after our teacher has her do so. She sits down with the girls and they start talking, I didn‚Äôt say anything yet until after the final bell that day, I ended up walking up to her and reintroduce myself and ask her if she was doing anything after school. ‚ÄúNo but I‚Äôd rather not hang with you either‚Äù she replies. It was a complete blindside and I kinda froze, as she walks away, I chase her and ask, ‚Äúwhat do you mean, I was just gonna ask if you wanted to hangout or maybe let me show you around the town is all‚Äù immediately spins around and smiles at me, it was something I remember clearly even as I write this, almost perfect white teeth with one tooth by the edge of her mouth that is just barely bigger then others, she was a looker for sure and that smile had to just kill guys. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard about you and what you do with girls, especially Lindsey‚Äù. Now Lindsey was a girl that I had lost my virginity to, yet to do so I had lied to her and said I liked her and led her on. Yeah I know I‚Äôm a shit head that‚Äôs not the point. Anyways immediately I start defending myself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that type of guy, seriously I just wanted to be nice but, if you don‚Äôt want to that‚Äôs fine. I can just ask tomorrow‚Äù. She looked more closely at me and now I could see her eyes and smell her, she wore a Victoria Secrets brand and it smelled good. But her eyes was what sold me, they were a sky blue, but with a little green. It was just enough to sink me in. ‚ÄúAsk me tomorrow? I just said no, why would you ask tomorrow?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWell, maybe you‚Äôll change your mind and realize I‚Äôm not that bad of a guy, and if you say no tomorrow then I can just ask the day after‚Äù She gave me a look that was between a smirk and maybe annoyance but I could see she was interested, ‚ÄúOk then well I‚Äôll see you tomorrow Danny‚Äù. As she walked away she kept turning her head to see if I was looking at her and sure enough she caught my eyes every time. God this hurts to write. I‚Äôm sorry if this is poorly written it‚Äôs painful to relive all of this. 



Anyways for two months I tried my hardest to show this girl that I wasn‚Äôt what she believed which was I was some ‚Äúplayer‚Äù. At this point, I don‚Äôt even know what was fueling me, it wasn‚Äôt just sex, but I didn‚Äôt know what to call it. Now two months in it was October and my school was having one of the last football games of the season and after, a friend of a friend was having a party.  Well at this point, me and Mackenzie became friends but she still hadn‚Äôt let me take her out, we‚Äôd talk during school but when that bell rang she was off. I asked her one time while we dated why she never even gave me her number when we were friends, ‚ÄúI wanted you to earn it‚Äù was her response, even now though I‚Äôm not sure I did. Anyways the game just ended and it was an easy victory( my school has always had a good team for any sport) as the parking lots are emptying, I started to my car since I stayed behind to say goodbye to some friends who weren‚Äôt going to the party, I got into my car and as I soon as I put my phone down, I hear tapping on my window. I screamed like a bitch as I get scared easily and hear laughing from outside. I look and there she is, Mackenzie. ‚ÄúHey I wasn‚Äôt sure but you think I could catch a ride to that party with you, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go but then I begged my parents and I‚Äôm good to go but my friends already left‚Äù. She was wearing those short athletic shorts that like volleyball girls wear, had a crop top that had our school mascot on it, and some face paint with a backwards SnapBack. I started to stare at her for maybe a little too long and she asked, ‚ÄúSo uhh, are you ok or you just gonna stare at me, because I‚Äôm okay with that, but I‚Äôd like to at least be stared at in maybe somewhere warmer.‚Äù I let her in and started on our way to the party, it wasn‚Äôt at a house of a friend but his family‚Äôs kinda vacation spot that is localish.  It was only about a 45 minute drive so we had time to chat and just shoot the shit. As we drive there she see‚Äôs a steak and shake and begins to freak out. ‚ÄúOh my god, oh my GOD, Danny please pull over and let us go there I need some food that isn‚Äôt complete garbage‚Äù I laugh and pull in through the window and we order our food. As we pull out, I park the car and we go eat in silence as music from my phone plays. ‚ÄúSo why don‚Äôt you date Hailey?‚Äù Hailey was a girl who had asked me out and I said I wasn‚Äôt interested. There was no reason other then I wanted Mackenzie, but I‚Äôd just say I don‚Äôt want a relationship. And Hailey wasn‚Äôt ugly either, a fit girl who was nice and extremely chill. I would‚Äôve probably tried if Mack wasn‚Äôt in the picture. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I guess it‚Äôs because she isn‚Äôt you‚Äù is all I say as I look down and continue to eat my food. I can feel her eyes staring and looking for me to smile or maybe laugh and say it‚Äôs a joke, but I just continue to eat. You see this girl, at this point did something that no other girl that I maybe flirted with or even dated had been able to do. She made me nervous, she made me step carefully, it was like dancing on a balcony, I literally can‚Äôt explain it, maybe like walking on thin ice. I could fall in and be gone forever, but I wanted to keep walking. She keeps staring not even eating at this point, until she asks me, ‚ÄúWould you like to show me around the town before we leave it for that party?‚Äù    ‚ÄúMackenzie, I thought you‚Äôd never ask‚Äù, I start back to our area, and start to show her all my favorite spots. At this point she‚Äôs been to a few including the donut store that everyone loves, and a park I like to go to sometimes just to walk. But there was a nature reserve that she hadn‚Äôt been to yet and at this point the party had already started so what could even more late do?



We begin to walk around it and just are talking to talk. There is no actual conversation but just words leaving our mouths and somehow form something. It was dark at this point so I had my flashlight on and was maybe closer then I had the right be to her. As we talk we learn more about each other, I learned she lost her father as he was a soldier overseas, and how her mom came here as Mack‚Äôs dad had family here that let them stay here. I learned she was an artist and wanted to be a famous one later in life but said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a dream I have but I know I‚Äôll probably be like an accountant or something realistic‚Äù. As we talked we kept getting closer and closer until eventually there was no gap between us and our shoulders were stuck together. Finally we finished the trail and got back to my car. She had a curfew unlike me who said I‚Äôd stay with a friend, so my time was cut short with her. I took her home with no words spoken between us, just music. Finally we get to her house and we just look at each other. ‚ÄúWell‚Äù I say, she repeats it back to me and just looks at me with the eyes of an angel. ‚ÄúI do have to be inside‚Äù she says, but no movement besides her eyes looking all over me, examining me, inch by inch. ‚ÄúIf you have to leave, then why aren‚Äôt you leaving?‚Äù I ask jokingly and smiling now. She smiles back and does something I didn‚Äôt expect, kisses me on my cheek, just a peck, but after opens the door and hops out. Looks in from the window since it‚Äôs open, and says, ‚ÄúDanny, you aren‚Äôt busy tomorrow are you?‚Äù I just stare still shocked, ‚ÄúHere, grabs a pen from the center console and writes a number on my arm, call me at 11 am. I‚Äôd love to hangout again‚Äù this time that smirk was back, a smile that showed curiosity and made me want to know more. She turns around and runs inside. It was there, that night, I fell hard for her. Shortly after that night, we wound up dating. It was without a doubt the only real relationship I had with another girl. We went to Homecoming together and during junior year we went to prom with each other and the entire time I was the most happy I think I had ever been. We were happy and she was just someone that made me, feel something. I can‚Äôt explain it but you know it, when you think about someone, you‚Äôll get a feeling that just takes over everything. It was perhaps the best 2 years of my life. Then senior year happened, and it‚Äôd change everything. You see it was getting to fall break or thanksgiving break whatever you call it, and Mackenzie was supposed to come over to my house right after she was done with work. She worked in the city by us at a grilled cheese place. I loved that place and she loved working there, since grilled cheese was her favorite food it was a perfect match, I could never make them correctly though. I just suck at cooking but she was always happy and that was enough for me. 


Anyways she didn‚Äôt come over that night, hadn‚Äôt responded to my texts, didn‚Äôt answer calls. But I didn‚Äôt think anything about  it‚Äôs sometimes her phone would die and maybe she just went home. I didn‚Äôt mind she had worked and was tired is all is what I told myself. I was wrong. She ended up being assaulted as she was walking back to her car by two guys. Yeah that type of assault, but when they were done with her they had beat her and left her like trash until someone found her and called 911. Her mom called me at midnight and I rushed to the hospital. She was gonna survive but was hurt bad, broken arm, bruises everywhere, god she was a mess. I had never seen her look so vulnerable. She was a tough girl, she could‚Äôve probably beat my ass, but this wasn‚Äôt her. This was someone who was attacked and was defenseless. 



She woke up eventually, and was allowed to leave the hospital a day later, after that I went to visit her at her house. She was different, no excitement in seeing me, no ‚ÄúDANNY‚Äù which is what I was accustomed to. But I knew why, she was changed this thing that happened to her did something to her, and I couldn‚Äôt help her. I couldn‚Äôt do anything to make her happy and that‚Äôs all I wanted. So I just sat on her bed for the entire I was there and we just were there in silence all the way up until I had to leave. This continued for a few days before she finally started speaking to me, and really anyone for that matter. She want going back to school, she‚Äôd finish the year by doing homeschooling, Jesus this is difficult I am writing this over a span of a few hours and it‚Äôs morning rn but Christ it‚Äôs just hard because I‚Äôm reliving every moment I had with her. 


After a few months, she had shown a lot of progress, she was comfortable and was talking again, although if around guys she didn‚Äôt know she was really defensive and was almost scared, if someone she felt safe around wasn‚Äôt  there. She let me sleep over but nothing physical besides kisses, I didn‚Äôt care anymore I wanted to just be there, the dumb high school boy stereotype of only wanting sex is stupid, at that point in time, I wanted to help her but I knew I couldn‚Äôt. I knew I was completely useless, because there was nothing I could do to fix what happened to her mentally. It took something from her I could see it her eyes and her smile and anything she did. She wasn‚Äôt herself but I could do nothing but be there for her. And try to help her get better. Eventually one day she calls me, ‚ÄúHey Danny can I ask a question?‚Äù  Confused I was silent but answered ‚Äúyeah of course what‚Äôs up?‚Äù I can hear her take a deep breath and then say, ‚ÄúWere you happy, like dating me before you know, my incident?‚Äù I literally can‚Äôt understand why I didn‚Äôt pick up on this. If only I had knew. It was obviously a cry for help but I was too stupid to think about it. ‚ÄúYeah I was happy I still am, you are amazing and you mean so much‚Äù I hear what I think now was a sob or her choking up and then she says ‚ÄúOk that‚Äôs all I needed, Danny I love you and you are the best thing that happened to me, I want you to be happy in life forever. You‚Äôve made my life something out of a love story and I can‚Äôt ask for anyone I would‚Äôve wanted to fall in love with.‚Äù She says she has to leave after that and ends the call immediately. I lay in bed and just think, scared and confused on what she meant, I didn‚Äôt want to assume anything I didn‚Äôt want to be scared anymore but I should‚Äôve known. She would still be here if I did something. But I didn‚Äôt and she was found by her mom later that day in her room hanging. She had written letters for some people. A few friends, her mom, grand parents, her brother, and me. The entire thing was a blur the call from her mom, the viewing, the funeral. All of it I just thought what if I had came to her after that call, I should‚Äôve done something. But I didn‚Äôt and it cost a life. 


The letter for me was something that kills me every time I think about it but it‚Äôs the last thing I have of her so I‚Äôve kept it all this time. 

Yesterday would‚Äôve been your birthday Mackenzie. I love you and miss you so goddamn much. I thought maybe making this post would help me but it hasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs made me realize you were the only one for me and I wasn‚Äôt there to protect you, I couldn‚Äôt save you. I danced to close to the edge and I‚Äôve been falling ever since you left. I know why you did it. I probably would‚Äôve too, but don‚Äôt worry. This will be my last post and my last work on this earth. To my parents and friends, you did nothing do not worry. There is nothing you could‚Äôve done I‚Äôve wanted to do this for a while now. To any readers in the subreddits I post this in, I leave with this message,


Protect the ones you love with everything you have but most importantly, cherish every moment you have with them and love them with every ounce of love you have. Be the best you can for them god knows I wasn‚Äôt enough and it shows. 


Mackenzie I love you and hope to see you soon.",30Jun2019,5

88,"I was redirected here from r/relationships.  This was really difficult for me so please be gentle.  

This is something I‚Äôve never told anyone, I don‚Äôt particularly like to think about it as it‚Äôs still so upsetting.  I‚Äôm a single mom, 2 kids, a tween boy and a toddler girl.  When I got pregnant with my little, I was in a casual hookup kind of thing, and we parted when I was pregnant with the understanding that he would not be a part of her life.  

I started dating this guy I had known for a long time when she was almost a year old.  I knew he wasn‚Äôt long term material, as he was very nomadic and drank too much for my lifestyle.  However, we had that immediate, intense attraction and had a lot of fun together.  He was also pretty great with my kids.  Not dad-like, but more of the fun uncle who never really grew up.  I never left him alone with them, he wasn‚Äôt very responsible.  

About a year into the relationship I was getting a bit suspicious about him cheating.  I did the ultimate crazy girlfriend thing and looked through his phone.  While he was in fact cheating, I also found pictures.  A lot of pictures.  Pictures of naked children.  These pictures weren‚Äôt sexually explicit, and he didn‚Äôt take them.  They were downloaded from random places on the internet.  They would not have qualified as child pornography by any stretch, but I knew he was using them that way.  Why else would he have them?

I can‚Äôt describe the feeling that came over me.  I didn‚Äôt know what to do, how to think. Just that I needed him gone.  So much clicked into place for me.  How doting he was about my daughter, how he used to talk way too much about his ex step-daughter.  How he asked for details about my own childhood sexual abuse experiences.  Just a bunch of stuff that should‚Äôve clued me in much earlier.  I felt like an idiot, like I failed to protect my children.  I always quietly judged mothers who ended up with pedophiles.  How could they not know?  Well I get it better now, but of course judge myself even more harshly.  

So of course I got rid of him immediately.  He went back to his ex, who had a daughter the age of the kids in the pictures.  I didn‚Äôt know what to do.  I couldn‚Äôt go to police, what he had wasn‚Äôt illegal.  I couldn‚Äôt talk to the mom, she hated me.  I settled on calling child protective services for advice.  They couldn‚Äôt really do anything.  I told him I knew and to watch his back, and he left the country soon after.  

So now, it‚Äôs been almost 2 years and I‚Äôm single and am terrified to start dating again.  I don‚Äôt trust myself to let the right people into my life.  I honestly feel like I deserve to be alone for bringing such evil into my home.  I know he never touched my kid, I‚Äôd like to think my gut always stopped me from letting them ever be alone together, but my gut really failed me as a whole in this situation so I‚Äôm unsure.  I guess I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to recover from this.  I never even told my therapist because I‚Äôm so ashamed.  I made this account so many months ago to ask advice but could never bring myself to admit my failure.  

Sorry this is so long, thank you for any advice you can give.",30Jun2019,1

92,"Sup, I was told to post this here instead of /r/relationships. It's a long one, but I need some advice.

For context, I've always prided myself on being ""chill"" and ""laid back"" which has made it easy to get along with most people. I grew up in an emotionally abusive household where I walked on eggshells to avoid setting my parents off. They would get exceedingly upset over minor things, and as a result I hardly get worked up over anything.

Over the past year (my second year of college), I've broken out of my shell and have been meeting new people and enjoying new experiences. However, this past semester has kind of made me realize that I take a lot of shit from people that I shouldn't be so accepting of. I'll try to give a few examples:

* At the start of the semester, my best friend \[M20\] of a couple years thought that I wasn't putting as much effort into the friendship and completely dropped me and cut all contact without trying to talk about it. I thought we just had conflicting schedules that made it hard to hang out and didn't learn his side until a few months afterwards. He reached out recently asking to be friends again, and I accepted him back without a second thought (and even apologized for things I could've done differently). He's extremely apologetic, but he caused me a lot of grief and confusion over the whole semester. I'm being really patient and gracious with him now, but I'm honestly frustrated with how ""okay"" I'm acting towards the whole situation. That's strange to say, but I feel like I'm doing a disservice to how hurt I felt. I'm brushing things off that I shouldn't because I don't want to cause friction.
* There was another guy \[M19\] that I met and had a brief fling with over the semester, and I set the boundary with myself that I wouldn't have sex unless we were in an established relationship. We had great communication, and he made me feel extremely comfortable, but he was fresh out of a 1.5-year-long relationship and didn't want to date yet. He said that his ""feelings would still be there"" when he was ready to date next semester. We'll be in classes together, so I believed him. I eventually threw out my boundary, lost my virginity, and that was that. He later confessed that his feelings weren't entirely genuine, which is perfectly fair since he had just gone through a breakup. He said that he probably wouldn't want to be in a relationship with me in the future. It kind of destroyed me, but he didn't mean to hurt me and he didn't get with me intending to ""rebound."" I don't regret it because it was fun before it went downhill, but I'm pissed at how I didn't stick to my boundaries and that I got too involved. After he admitted his change of heart, I felt so terrible that I didn't want to be friends with him anymore, but that only lasted a week before I decided to make amends. We have an okay friendship now.
* Lastly, my ex-boyfriend \[M20\] recently contacted me wanting to be friends again. We tried to be friends too soon after we broke up about a year ago, and it ended horribly. He wanted to be closer friends with me than I wanted to be with him, and it led to a lot of tension until he finally cut contact. Now, he's reached back out and apologized, and he says that he ""needs friends"" and that I've ""always been supportive even if he didn't realize it"" and is trying to fix some negative behaviors he's had towards me in the past. My first instinct was to forgive him, talk to him, and try to be friends again, but now I'm questioning if it's really in my best interest or healthy for me to do that. I've been doing fine since he cut contact, and while the guy is nice to talk with sometimes, I don't really feel any need to have him back in my life.

Long story short, I feel like I'm too quick to accept apologies and ""make up,"" and I've decided I need to stick up for myself more. Obviously having issues is a normal part of most relationships, but I think I have an unhealthy habit of letting my own feelings go for the sake of moving on. In most cases I have every right to be upset about something that I easily ""let go,"" but I always try to empathize with the other person to a fault. This has happened with almost every close friendship that I've had.

It doesn't help that more than half of my male friends (which make up the majority of my friend group since I'm in a male-dominated major and have more stereotypical ""guy"" hobbies) have developed a crush on me or asked me out since I became single a year ago. It's been so draining to either reject my friends and wait for the rift to mend or have awkward conversations where I lay down boundaries or expressly say that I'm only interested in friendship. I'm so upset with myself and my friendships right now. I've been fantasizing about cutting contact with a lot of old friends and starting new, but I need to fix how I approach relationships or I'll just fall into the same types of dynamics with new people.

TL;DR: I don't want to stop being patient - I think it's a great quality to have - but I need to learn how to respect myself and moderate it. What behaviors of mine should I look out for and try to change? How do I balance being patient with someone that's hurt me with standing up for my own feelings? I used to think there was never a thing as too much patience, but I've realized how much I'm disrespecting myself lately and really need all the advice that I can get. I don't want to get too jaded and push all my friends away, but I'm really breaking down right now and don't know what to do. The last thing I want is to be considered a bitch, and it's made me so unbelievably passive. I feel like I don't have honest relationships with any of my closest friends anymore.

Thanks in advance.",30Jun2019,5

My tirade. 


Everyday I wake up and it‚Äôs something else, and maybe I‚Äôm just bitching and moaning and need to stop and just take my life for what‚Äôs it worth and get over it. But sometimes I wake up and the first thing I‚Äôm filled with is a palpable hatred for the world around me and everything and everyone in it, then I get up, put my clothes on, my duck boots and my hat and go to work where I either work in a kitchen or wash dishes depending on the day. And then I start to think and the palpable hatred in my blood is brought to a boil in my veins as I continue washing plate after plate, getting paid fucking shit. I make shit money, but have to work this job cause I‚Äôve got no other way to pay rent or provide for myself while I‚Äôm in school, my dad helps a little but it‚Äôs not to too much. I sleep on an air mattress currently and work 30-40 hours a week and my girlfriend wakes up and says, ‚Äúmy back hurts from sleeping on this thing‚Äù with a tone that implies it‚Äôs crappy, but I can‚Äôt afford a new mattress cause my old one is a twin I‚Äôve slept on my entire life and I‚Äôm a tall guy so my feet even hang off that when I sleep on it. That made me a little upset. But I love her a lot, even though she complains sometimes, I don‚Äôt care, cause she loves me and cares about me and there‚Äôs not many people who do love and care for me as she does. I try not to take that for granted. Everyday money money money that‚Äôs all that matters and it seems to be the only thing I‚Äôm chasing and I don‚Äôt even want to fucking chase it. I‚Äôm so sick and tired, I just want enough, that‚Äôs all I want. Just some food, a little weed, a place to stay, and maybe even a tv. That‚Äôs all I fucking want but that‚Äôs too much to ask for. I listen to other people bitch and moan all day and I see my friends come into the restaurant where I work and they eat food, food which I can‚Äôt even afford with the money they‚Äôre paying me, all the while I scrub shit off plates shoulder deep in shit water and wet clothes. And I hate watching kids my age who have rich daddies who just get money all the time from their parents and spend it like it‚Äôs nothing. But it‚Äôs fair and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, it‚Äôs just upsetting. And the truth of it is, even if I had all the things I wish for, I‚Äôd probably still be just as upset. Moving on.
There is a plethora of ongoing quarrels within my own mind over everything from small financial decisions to contemplating my own reality and happiness. Sometimes I get so caught up in these arguments In my head that I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm thinking about or how I truly feel anymore. And everything pisses me off from the way other people talk and act, the things they do, not to mention my affinite hate of the world around me and all the things that are wrong with it. I hate social media because it only serves to further other people‚Äôs vanity and the image of themself they‚Äôd like to portray. And it‚Äôs saddens me to sit and look around as I do now and see the condition of my life and the world around it. I know I‚Äôm young, and things will changes and perhaps one day this will not all seem so bleak. But even through all my love, hate, and sadness pervades one thing which truly disturbs me, and that‚Äôs the futility of it all. It‚Äôs hard for me to find meaning in the suffering around me, I‚Äôve been an addict before(to stimulants, I.e. any kind of upper pill I can get my fiendish hands on) and my experiences with euphoric drugs has forever polarized the way in which I see the world, never again to find joy and happiness in the simple small things, just looking to get high and be happy for a little while, then I come down and it‚Äôs all shit. I quit doing it because of how shitty things are either way, if I‚Äôm on drugs my life sucks more, if I‚Äôm not on drugs my life sucks a little less but nonetheless it fucking still sucks. Everything just seems to be without meaning in the world and in my life right now. The only things that feel real and that I know have meaning, is the love I have for a few people, and the hatred I have for so much.

102,"Well, it's not exactly my childhood home (It's my ""teenage home"" I guess) but it's very special to me. I moved here with my grandparents when I was 14 and I'm 20 now. That's basically my entire teenage years and high school. I'm quite an introverted person, and I spent a looot of time in my bedroom. I wouldn't be surprised if an entire 3 out of the 6 years were spent in my bedroom alone lol

It's just such a surreal feeling right now. I'm spending my final hours in a house that I have been in for such a long time. My new house isn't super far away (only a 30 minute drive) but I still feel pretty sad. Before I lived here, I lived in a house that was only 5 minutes away, and had lived there from the ages of 7-14. So the vast majority of my memories are from this area that I will leave tomorrow. Most of my friends are here too.

My grandparents will also miss me a lot. I've been with them for so long, and even before I actually lived with them, I visited them every Thursday and Friday. This will be the first time in my life that I will not see them regularly. I also won't see their 3 cats anymore.

An Ode To Alice

This is my account of a balmy summer night

When a pretty lady entered my line of sight

Our eyes met across the room and I knew it all felt right

She was bangin' like a shotty and she hit like dynamite

She was dressed in yellow

She said ""Oh hello""

""Do you mind if I sit down my good fellow?""

I said ""I sure don't young lady so just sit right there""

All my dreams were comin' true and I couldn't help but stare

She said with a smile ""Can we chat for a while

I just want to say I admire your style

Maybe if you want we could trade some digits

When opportunity starts knockin' I don't want to miss it""

I said ""Well that sounds good to me but if it's all the same

It would really be nice if you could tell me your name""

She said ""Apologies my dear, I didn't mean any malice

It's very nice to meet you sir, and you can call me Alice""

The very next night I was hangin' out with Alice

We were munching on some eggrolls down at the Golden Palace

I said ""Alice, you seem like an awesome chick on balance

I bet there's something up your sleeve, I bet you've got some hidden talents""

Alice replied with a glimmer in her eye

She said ""Of course I do my dear. You know me, I'm super fly""

She said ""I'm sorry if this sounds like it comes out of the blue

But I just wanted to tell you that I have a crush on you

And if I had to take a guess I'd say you feel it too

So now that my cards are on the table, tell me what you want to do""

I said ""Alice since the day we met, I mean right out the gate

I've been thinking that you're super cool, I think you're pretty great

I don't believe in destiny, I don't believe in fate

But it feels like my entire life has led up to this date""

A couple days later we went out yet again

I was having a good time hanging out with my new friend

Alice said ""Please excuse me sir, I need a minute to walk back

To the lady's room so just sit back and relax""

Across the room a young lady gave me a little wink

It was then the waiter told me that she bought me a drink

It came with a napkin with her number written on it

It was written in red lipstick wrapped around a gin and tonic

But I was there with Alice so I turned the lady down

I was already hanging out with the coolest chick in town

I assured the pretty stranger I didn't mean to be so callous

""I really am quite flattered but I'm already here with Alice""

It was date number three so it was a milestone

But Alice was busy with some drama of her own

""I'm very sorry sir, but I'm not here alone""

She said when he asked if he could put his number in her phone

""Apologies good sir, I'm already spoken for

I'm here with my friend already, he's the only one I have eyes for""

She walked back to the table and we talked about our day

But then I interrupted because I had something to say

I said ""Alice, ever since that day I met you at that bar

I've been thinking that you're pretty great and we could go real far

I hope it's not a problem if I'm forward but it's true

I just wanted you to know that I'm crushing on you too""

I walked Alice home at the end of the night

She was looking an angel glowing in the moonlight

She gave me a kiss on the cheek and she said goodnight

It was obvious to me this chick was outta sight",30Jun2019,8

The worst part? Even though it's a wholesome subreddit, the mods are doing NOTHING. They have left it all alone, to dismay of many. It upsets me. Not the drama, not anything besides the sudden toxicness coming from normally peaceful users. 

I'm really upset. The mods will do nothing and everyone is at each other's throats. Yes, it is KingAni's subreddit, but it used to be just Ani memes and cat/dog pictures. 

I don't know what to do. I wanna help but I'm not a mod, the only thing I can do is just keep posting cat images or just leaving it all together. I don't wanna do that. I support Ani, her opinion about it? I don't care. I care about Ani being able to be human and have opinions just like us.

I wanted to tell you about my granddaughter, Elsa. Elsa was named after my mother who came to Illinois from Poland at the turn of the century. We didn‚Äôt have much growing up, but she and Pappy always made sure we had a good, healthy home. My mother was always very lively and taught me the importance of being frugal and confident in today‚Äôs ever-changing world. Anyway, I went on a bit of a tangent there. I wanted to say that I really see my mother in young Elsa. Elsa just graduated from high school with many accolades in science and math. In fact, she received a scholarship to one of the top 8 schools in the country! Like my mom, young Elsa is so intelligent.

I wrote Elsa a letter this evening congratulating her on her achievements. However, she lives across the country so I was unable to attend her graduation. While her parents have been very frugal, they still struggle with finances. Being the old lady that I am, I didn‚Äôt exactly have enough funds to visit her via airplane. I guess I shouldn‚Äôt worry too much, because I went to 3 of my grandchildren‚Äôs HS graduations last year, and 2 college graduations this year! I‚Äôd say that all my grandchildren take after my mother in that they are incredibly intelligent.

If I was ever in a bad mood, they wouldn't ask me what's wrong, but instead would jump to things like ""no one wants to be around someone with a bad attitude"" and ""the Lord loves a cheerful giver"". It was like they couldn't see a valid reason for me to ever be upset. I wasn't allowed to be angry or sad. I existed just to be a good, helpful daughter to them (something I'm still struggling with today as you can imagine).

Well, now I'm 22, been at college for awhile, and I have a boyfriend of nearly 3 years. And he dismisses any negative feelings in a different way. He looks for solutions or tries to calm me down. Says ""it's not worth it"" or ""it'll be okay"". Which is better than my parents by far (of course) and I love that he can be level headed when I'm upset, but it's still just not as satisfying as what happened yesterday.

We had plans with other friends to go to an activity this evening, and last night at 9 o'clock (seriously! As late as 9 o'clock!) The activity place called me and told me they couldn't honor the reservation that we had made literally a month ago. They gave me 3 different reasons for it too, so I was lied to at least twice. And eventually the woman on the phone told me she'd have to speak to a manager and then get back to me.

Well, we happened to be with the same friends we were going to the activity with tonight, and so when I got off the phone, clearly upset, my boyfriend and our friends (a husband and wife) were wondering what was going on. So I explained, fully prepared to have everyone tell me how ""it's okay"" and ""don't get worked up over nothing"" and the husband just jumped into it.

He asked to see the confirmation emails, pulled up their website, started hunting for cancellation policies, looking at the better business bureau website, checking the company's Facebook page for information, and insisted that he have a word with them if they tried calling any of us again (which did happen, and he chewed them out over lying after the company tried to tell him a completely different lie about why they weren't honoring our reservation).

And like ... It feels so nice. I've never had someone be angry when I was also angry. No one diminished my feelings; no one tried to calm either of us down.
