0,"I’m moving out of my apartment and back to my parents’ place (unfortunately, but it’s temporary). 

I’m pregnant. My parents don’t yet know this. That also means I shouldn’t be doing a ton of heavy lifting, and especially not by myself. Today, we went to the apartment and loaded the bulk of what was left of my belongings and brought it home. This included a big computer chair, a small (but full) bathroom cabinet, and several huge bags of kitchen appliances and supplies. All very heavy. 

Now, my sister (15) has seasonal allergies. A stuffy nose and she’s sneezing, and now her head hurts. She has been told to take an allergy pill with the herbal tea my mom made for her, go lay down in bed with the fan on and relax. 

I am much worse off with the allergies this year because we have a dog, and I have asthma, but I’ve learned over the years to tough it all out and put my head down to get done what needs to be done. 

My mom didn’t help me load up my truck at the apartment, so I figured she was saving her energy to help me unload at the house. I was wrong. So I was forced to carry huge loads down the stairs at the apartment and walk back up about 20 times, to lift the shit into the truck myself, and to come back home and bring it all into the house myself while she and my sister sat back and drank tea and watched YouTube together. 

My question is, why bother even being present if you’re not going to help at ALL? All she did was complain that my kitchen was dirty. I can’t just tell her I’m pregnant because that’s a whole other can of worms but seriously I want to look up at her while I’m sweating and struggling with a box and say “Well?? You’re not the damn pregnant one here, work a little.”",12Jun2019,1
1,"It seems like Redditors have a very distinct mentality in being kind and thoughtful to one another. They also have almost an unanimously shared political view centered in the center left to the  left left. 

Meanwhile, FB and 4chan typically host a widely different clientele with widely different norms, shared political views, mentality etc. 

Why do you think that is? From a sociological/anthropologist perspective that is extremely interesting.",12Jun2019,0
2,I want to believe theirs a plan for me. That everything I’m doing is going to somehow pay off. That the adversity I face will somehow make the future or where ever I go after I die somehow better. There’s a lot we don’t know about the universe so it’s possible.,12Jun2019,2
3,"I’ve been going through a rough time lately. One of my best friends, who I thought I knew very well, left me due to my mental state, (which I don’t reveal to anyone). Another friend used me and manipulated me for about two years.. All for the purpose of making herself look better. One of my close family members had me grow up believing it was wrong to talk about my interests, so when I hit high school, it was so new to me to see people talk about movies, shows, music, books or other forms of music they like. All so openly to each other. I still have a hard time even naming a song I’ve loved all my life. 

I’ve never spoken openly about a song I love. Until now. Here is a link:

[for you](https://open.spotify.com/track/0q6LuUqGLUiCPP1cbdwFs3?si=WuxZb7cDRh6HmnrLbcGC6Q)

Someone out there, if you’re reading this, you’re not alone. You are loved. Speak up about how you feel and don’t hide what you love, as long as it’s peaceful and acceptable. 

Someone out there, this song helped me a lot through  some rough times. I decided to share because it could help you too. 

Someone out there, thank you for reading this. I’ve never been this open about myself before so this was very hard to write. 

Someone out there, you’re not alone. Call out for help.",12Jun2019,13
4,"So, a few months ago my girlfriend of two and a half years (living together for like a year and a half) just up and left out of the blue. She had one valid reason to be upset with me, and I've taken responsibility for it and fixed it. However, she gave me about 50 other very vague reasons as to why she was leaving. I later found out that her best friend (who is political and religious extremist IMO, and I have the direct opposite views she does) convinced her to leave me. Which, yenno whatever I dont really care. After she left I began to feel so much better. My mental and physical health improved by an order of magnitude. I'm also seeing someone who I am very much in love with, and am totally over my ex. Now here comes the odd part, that I am confused on.
Yesterday, my ex came over while my current girlfriend and I were at my place to get some of her stuff, which at this point has been sitting in my closet for several months. I've been trying to get her to come get it for at least two months now. Not just a few things either, a full car load. She had it kinda stuffed away to where it wasnt obvious she had left stuff, but it was there nonetheless. Anyway, the entire time she kept stalling actually taking the stuff out to her car, and then I realized she had actually left some things still. In addition, she obviously did not like my new girlfriend despite the fact that my new girlfriend was super polite and welcoming. 
In addition, her brand new boyfriend (who from the way she has described hes very anxious, very insecure, very unsure of himself and almost a little controlling) decided to just move in out of the blue and she doesnt seem happy about it at all. I think shes deeply regretting leaving me and sees how happy I am with my new girlfriend, and how happy I make my new girlfriend and wishes that she could be back with me. Am I crazy?",12Jun2019,5
5,"So this is a...situation. So my roommate left at around 7pm. On her way out she put the trash and recycling out. City law states that we are allowed to put out the trash from 7pm - 7am which is what she did. At around 8pm my dog barks at the door (which she does whenever a stranger is in front of it usually the mailman or deliver dude) so I get up to check. I open the door (because I was expecting maybe a random delivery for my roommate since she buys random things a lot) and find an envelope. Now I just moved the city so I have no idea what this is. I pick it up and read “Code of Violation Notice”. I don’t know who’s in charge of issuing these but what I read is “A bin of trash and two filled recycling bins put on sidewalk. Trash must remain stored until trash day.” So I start kind of freaking because I don’t do bad things. I have never gotten in trouble with any type of law. I don’t even drive a car to get tickets! So I text my roommate about when she put out the trash, look up times to put out trash and then I read the ticket more thoroughly. It gives the date 6/11/19. Okay that’s today, but the time was what made me furious “time: 7:19 AM”. Really my question is simple but I can’t find answers on the internet. Does the department that issues these city code violations keep a record via computer database of when the ticket is issued so I can maybe contest this ticket by getting a cross investigation of when this ticket was placed via the computer database (don’t really know how to word this sorry) versus when it says on the ticket itself? I can see there is a barcode so it must be scanned and the time saved into a computer database somewhere that can prove that whoever issued this is just an asshole.

Probably an unrelated note- but my roommate is also being kind of harassed by an officer. This guy is basically stalking her car to try and get a date out of her. She once arrived to her car to see a ticket on the windshield that only says “happy birthday!” And includes his number with a call me. She clearly states to him that she isn’t interested and a few days later she just sees him rounding the block of our house which is OUT of his jurisdiction. Which means he stalked her back to her house one day. Coincidentally, this ticket arrives two days after her last run in with him when she states she doesn’t like men (she’s bi, but obviously just wanted him GONE).",12Jun2019,3
6,"My childhood friend has been through some shit the last couple of years. His father leaving is the one that has had the biggest impact on his life. I really don’t like to sound full of myself but even from a young age I’ve been good at reading people. Fairly strong intuition and how people are really feeling at the moment. I’ve had a psychological evaluation confirm my EQ/ emotional quotient/intelligence. Every time I’m with said friend he always cheers my mood up. Always in a positive mood, I’ve never seen him depressed. Albeit he’s been like this since we were younger but it’s really hard to tell if he’s really not depressed or if it’s just a facade. Friend is literally never home and always looking for someone to chill with. I just want to know if there is something wrong and what I can do to help because him and I are like brothers, only closer. (Insert spongebob and squidward scene).",12Jun2019,3

9,"It was due to my own misunderstanding of how much time I had left to register for college housing that I had to find a place and people to stay with on my own. It was very difficult convincing people I knew that we could live together in the same place and be fine. A lot of them were just a tad too picky, understandably, to cooperate and figure out a living situation together. Then, something happened, one of my friends ended up in a similar situation to me. They didn't have a place to stay and commuting would be exhausting and difficult. I felt like everything else would work out and began to schedule tour after tour to find a place that would work out together. We were already running out of time and places to live so I began to pretty much as anyone who fit his needs and mine.

&amp;#x200B;

Then today happened.

&amp;#x200B;

After doing two more tours, he told me that he gave up and intended on doing some other program that is pretty much impossible for me to get into. This all happened because I was too lax on finding a new place for the next year.

10,"Making peace with the present moment means making peace with ourselves, with others, and with the totality of life. Once peace with all phenomena is established, we can abide in great joy, harmony, and fulfillment. In a sense, only then do we really begin to live life to its fullest potential.

In this article, I explore how we can make peace with the present moment by cultivating three qualities,

1. Wisdom of understanding cause and effect,
2. Development of mindfulness,
3. Deep compassion.

I hope you find value and benefit from this article and may we all work together to create a happy and harmonious world.

11,"I had a core needle breast biopsy done on Monday. While I anxiously wait for the pathology results, I wanted to share my experience in the hope others might share their opinions or experiences as well...

Background:

I first discovered a small, hard, pea-sized lump in my breast (basically right under my areola) about 3-4 months ago. I didn't think much of it, but after casually mentioning it to my therapist, I scheduled a doctor's appointment at her suggestion.

My doctor referred me to a breast clinic for a mammogram and ultrasound, saying it's likely benign but recommending imaging out of an abundance of caution. I had the mammogram and ultrasound done at the breast clinic. 

I was a little put off that the ultrasound technician was sighing and complaining she couldn't find the lump during the exam. After a few minutes of this (""All I see are ducts..."") she snapped a few pictures and left the room to consult with the radiologist. After coming back, she explained that the radiologist thinks it's a sebaceous cyst and to come back in three months. I wasn't really convinced it was a sebaceous cyst, since it wasn't attached to my skin, but I'm no medical professional... So I decided to request a disc of the images/report and seek out a second opinion.

I received the images and the report (which classified the lump as BIRADS 3) and set up an appointment with this other breast clinic. The radiologist there reviewed the results and concurred with the initial radiologist's classification and recommendation.

Fast forward three months to a couple of weeks ago. I'm having the follow up ultrasound at the new clinic and the tech calls in the radiologist who recommends I have the area biopsied, as the area is irregular and not suggestive of what they thought it was initially.

They performed an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy yesterday (which was a breeze--better than going to the dentist) but apparently I was playing it a little too cool and stupidly didn't ask any questions. Questions like, did that sighing ultrasound tech who performed the first ultrasound not actually find the correct area? What is the meaning of this exchange between the ultrasound tech and the radiologist during the biopsy (Radiologist: ""What did you measure it at?"" Tech: ""6.5"") ? Most of all, why do they feel the need to do a biopsy now when it doesn't feel like it's changed?

By the way, I'm 28 and female.

TLDR I'm anxious while I await my biopsy results and felt compelled to spill it on Reddit. Thanks for reading!",12Jun2019,1

16,"Contacted my local police dep. Hopefully they can find them. 

I tried to sell an iPhone XR today. The guy got here after an hour long drive. He notified me he was outside. Upon discovery, the vehicle was in..questionable condition, with no plates, and 4 people in the vehicle. I instinctively had a bad feeling about the situation, but continued onwards because I was desperate for the sale.

I was on the passenger side, as he was allegedly buying the phone. His friend (driver) asked how much, and they asked to see it, so I gave it over. 

As you could imagine, shortly after, they pulled away quickly. I wasn’t sure what I was thinking but I tried to jump into the passenger window, but that didn’t work out too well and almost got ran over. 

Walked away with some street burns on my elbows and back. Got my carrier to cancel the phone’s ability to be used, and thankfully I also have insurance for it so I’ll be getting a new one.

Be careful out there..you never know what someone’s intentions might be. I’m just hoping he has something coming to him for doing this, and I’m sure this wasn’t the first time. 

I found his social accounts but there’s only so much I can do from this point besides wait for my replacement.

I know our relationship was toxic when we argued. We always battled each other instead of battling the problem. I learned that from my communication books. After Our breakup I was so heartbroken that I lost you over communicating I started reading books about being a better partner. I wanted to give you space and come back a stronger me so we wouldn’t have to go through this ever again. 

It sucks that it took us breaking up for me to get my shit together and actually pick up a book on how to communicate with my partner. 

As I read the books I saw our behaviors that we did when arguing and went omg this is so us and it’s sad. 

We always wanted change but just expected it to just happen. We figured time would fix us or at least I did. But education was thing that would fix us.  

How else could we learn to be better partners? From our parents? Scratch that, our single moms who despise our dads? Well that’s your story, my dad is dead lol. But point is we couldn’t ask them to teach us. They aren’t the Perfect examples. They yelled their points across and wouldn’t dare listen to the other’s POV. Sound familiar? Yeah that’s us. Products of our environments. 

Yo to all my young people or people in general that grew up in single parent homes, or homes where people argue a lot. pick up a book or read an article about listening to your partner and communication. We know it’s wrong but growing up we subconsciously do it because that’s what we’re used to you know? I would hate if you lose someone you love over something you two just need to educate yourselves on and fix. 

May not be able to fix your parents, insert that whole old dog thing... but fix you first man. There’s a better way to do things. 

And baby girl, I know you wanna do you right now and you have every right too. You’re single I hear you... but don’t lose out on someone who loves you with his everything for a stress free time partying and meeting guys who will just fuck you and leave you heartbroken and lonely. I’m not about to sit here and watch you give yourself to other people and then you crawl back when you’re ready... fuck that. I’ve accepted that I’ve lost you. But I’m making a new bed and I’m hoping you come in before I lock the door.

19,"We live in a world where we always worry about what other people think of us. At least, I do. 

I don’t even know who I am. I’m so caught up in what everyone else thinks that I feel like I can’t truly be myself. I’m a people pleaser. A social chameleon. I gauge people’s reactions to certain things and adjust my response according to them. A peace-keeper maybe. Someone who takes both sides in an argument instead of just one. 

I always hear how “ambitious” and “hard working” I am. When really, the only reason I am where I am today is because I just wing it everyday. I’ve stayed at my current job for the past year because I’m comfortable. I don’t like new things. Even if I wanted to quit, I don’t think I even have the willpower to do it. 

I post on social media to get approval. It gives me a good feeling to see my friends support me. Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be someone else. Have a different family, a different boyfriend, different friends. I run different scenarios in my head daily. 

I went and sat by my local river today and maybe that’s what opened up my eyes. That’s when I truly felt myself. There was no one around and I was in nature. I was in my element. At that moment, I didn’t care what people thought of me. For the first time in as long as I can remember, I didn’t feel that pit of anxiety in my stomach. I felt at peace. Alone. Isolated. I probably sat there for a good half hour. I wish I didn’t have to leave. 

I do know I love nature. I do know I’m passionate. I have strong feelings even though I don’t share them often in fear of starting an argument. I know I have a kind heart. And have good intentions. But other than that, I really have no fucking idea who I am. I feel like I live in a bubble. And scared of what others will do if they find out the real me. I’m scared of people leaving me.

How could they even wear a hat that RESEMBLES the hat that is worn as a symbol for white supremacy and tyranny? Then I noticed that there was an Indian boy crying. Also, an African American boy was crying. Asians, Hispanics, Russians, were all crying because of this racist, hateful act. 
I walked up to him and punched him in the face. Then, I kicked him and pushed him, and slapped him. Soon later, I was arrested by racist police and brought to jail, just because I was standing up for what I believe in. It was very scary, and I was afraid that the police would shoot me (I'm homosexual, so I was afraid they would shoot me for my beliefs).

23," Im new to reddit btw. I had posted this on a different reddit but no body answered. I'm not sure if I'm posting on a right reddit page, but I'm hoping someone can give me any advice or help somehow.

For years I have had this issue as well as being lazy. I'm 17 and I'm so behind in school that I might not graduate. I'm homeschooled and I have a deadline date to get everything done. I just can't stop. I get distracted by my phone or music or just start daydreaming. I've told my parents about this and asked about getting help, but they refuse to for some reason. I've tried removing distractions, setting a schedule, and waking up early, but I still can't manage to get my school work done. I also get very depressed and lonely at times because I don't really have a social life. I need to figure out how I can just stop this starting today or else I won't graduate. 

  I also have a hard time with studying to. For example, I read the material the best the I can and have even tried writing notes while I read, but I still can't remember anything on the tests. I still manage to get good grades because I go back through the book and find the answers, but I know that this isn't the way school is supposed to be like. And I'm probably not learning properly. The reason I'm concerned about this is because if I ever do graduate, I want to go to college, but I don't know how to study or do well in real school.

I just really need help. I want to graduate and I want to prepare myself for when I go to college ( if I ever do). I also just want to learn how to be a productive and normal human being because there are times when I can't even get myself out of bed in the morning and it just sucks.

As the title says, i’m 23 female. I still live at home, and for some background - i’m hispanic. For the most part, our culture as a whole is still very old schooled, you have to be married before you move out and no premerital sex etc. On top of that, my parents are very religious so i grew up in quite a strict household. 

My boyfriend (21) and i have been together for 2 years and have not been allowed to take trips together or spend the night together whatsoever. I still have a curfew so i usually have to come home around 10:30pm. I’m super responsible, i don’t drink, party, smoke... none of that. my life literally consists of work, eat, sleep, repeat. 

My sister (27) and I have been wanting to go on a beach trip with her, her husband, their 2yo toddler, my boyfriend and I. Today we finally decided on a date and i found an airbnb and i booked it. A couple hours after booking, my sister called me to let me know i will not be allowed to sleep in my own room during the trip - i would have to sleep in the same room as her and my niece, they didn’t want me to separate from them throughout the day, and then also told me i would have a curfew of 10pm.

i cant even begin to explain how insulted and hurt and oppressed i’m feeling by my family right now. after that, I immediately considered cancelling the trip, because i do not want to be babysat during this stupid trip. we will all be miserable.

 1)how do i break it to my parents that i want to move out? how do i avoid any resentment or anger? 2) I am currently only working a part time job and not really generating enough income to live by myself. If i did, is barely get by. my boyfriend cannot move in with me and i don’t know anyone who i could roommate with. how do i find someone or if possible, any tips on how could i do this on my own?

I’m not sure if I’m slipping into a depressive episode because of lack of purpose. 

I keep the house really clean and cook every meal. I send little thoughtful texts to him at work. I help out financially with a couple hundred dollars here and there and buy all the groceries for the two of us. It’s not like I’m mooching, I carry my weight with savings.

But I feel like everything I do is being taken for granted more and more. I voice appreciation, compliment him, encourage him - daily. I know I do because it brings me happiness to express verbally how I feel. I also love making gifts, wether in the form of actual gifts or food that’s a special treat. And lately.... it all just gets kind of waved off. I know I shouldn’t be looking for affirmation like this and basing all my worth on one person. It’s not fair to ask him to validate me daily. I’m just lonely and I need someone to tell me I’ll be okay. 

It’s only been a week and a half since I left my old job. I worked 6 days a week for nearly years, only ever taking four days in a row off twice. I work hard. I try to stay positive.

31,"New poster to Reddit after lurking a bit. Trigger warning I guess too, if the title wasn’t enough. Just want to get this out there. 

I’m a guy. I grew up in a conservative suburban Christian area, and taught the messages of “dating is bad” and “gay is evil” etc. The usual stuff. That was my life all through college, because I stayed in that bubble for undergrad by going to a small Christian college. I never attempted dating, and focused on school. 

In high school, I was homeschooled so there was further social isolation. I had friends but only a few. Only one close guy friend who stopped talking to me after graduation. I’ve never been able to relate to other guys and was bullied a lot in elementary school (public school) for not being like the other boys. When I hit puberty, I had no interest in girls. I jerked off to guys and had that classic Christian closet experience. The thing I feel was different was that I didn’t want an outlet to explore sexuality because I believed so strongly that dating was evil. So my distrust of relationships generally eclipsed my desires to explore boys. 

Fast forward to after college. I move away for a job to an extremely liberal city I’ve fallen in love with. Smartphones existed but weren’t everywhere yet, and I was poor so I had a dumb phone. Gay apps existed but I didn’t have them. I joined a website instead and chatted with guys for about a year. I was 22. 

To summarize how I got here, i had a couple hookups with older men that messaged me. I had no attraction, but I had curiosity. I never had actual sex, just kissing and cuddling. I was still a virgin. A couple months of me flirting with actually having sex, I message a guy and we hit it off. I go to his place after dinner to cuddle and watch a movie. He guided my head to his crotch and pushed me down. I was surprised and didn’t know what to do. Then he turns me around and before I know it, things get more...serious. I freak out and ask him what he’s doing but he just grunts and continues. I don’t remember when happened next but I tried to stop it. I didn’t want that yet. It gets blurry but I walked a few miles home disoriented, in pain, vomiting, and dizzy. I don’t know how I got home. I remember getting on a bus at one point. 

Despite that I kept trying to meet guys. I met another guy online who turned out to be cool and we met up several times. However, one time he wanted to do it rough and it scared me and I kept saying no. He didn’t listen. 

Dumb me kept trying. I met another guy I ended up really liking. One time he suggested a threesome so I agreed. He got rough too and I kept saying no, tried to yell it. I started crying a bit as I started blacking out. I only remember the third guy realizing I was serious and getting the rough guy to stop. 

So those are the three times. Ever since then I’ve never had an encounter I’ve enjoyed. Really I’ve never had an enjoyable encounter ever. I black out a lot and come to when the sex is done. My limbs go limp, and there’s always pain.  I’m in my 30s now and can’t even try to have sex with women, I have no experience, no desire, and no girl would be with a guy like me. I’d just be a story to her friends of a 30 something guy who sucks at sex. 

I’ve never told anyone about this. Nobody knows I’m into guys, everyone thinks I’m straight. I can’t let anyone know. I just keep this bottled up and try to deal with it myself. Anytime the questions come up of “what was your first kiss” or “who did you lose your virginity to”, I cringe and recite deflecting answers or my recycled lies. Nobody can know my first kiss was with a 65 year old strange man from the internet, or that I lost my virginity being raped by a man I don’t know from the internet. So cue the further social isolation - everyone else has shared common experiences they can reflect on that I can’t. I know I’m never going to have a relationship because of this and the walls I build, and I’m trying to make my peace with being alone forever - physically and with my thoughts.",12Jun2019,655
32,"My husband and I moved to a new city so I could start school, which begins in July. I’ve been here for about a month and he has to travel for work a lot so I’m alone. I only work part time because I’m finishing some school things up, but my motivation is zero and I’m so lonely. I thought I’d be excited to take this next step, and maybe once school starts and I’m finally doing what I want to be doing this will be different, but I hate it. I miss all of my friends. I’ve never been this far away from home before and it sucks having this time to myself and being unable to go home and see friends. Im currently standing in the kitchen trying to decide what to do and I don’t want to do anything. Literally nothing. I don’t want to read, I don’t want to exercise, I don’t want to watch tv. I have no idea what to do with myself. I haven’t been in this kind of head space before and it’s really scary and upsetting to me. 

Sorry for the pity party. I don’t feel like I can complain to my husband because I don’t want him to feel bad about traveling, and I don’t want to bother my friends with this because they’re all busy with their own lives.",12Jun2019,5
33,I was little. My belly button was a bit of an outie but becoming an innie so water still got trapped in there. Mom was drying me off in the living room and while I was looking the other way she took a corner of the towel around her finger and rubbed the inside of my belly button with it. My belly button has always been so sensitive and I could feel all the rough fibers in the towel against the ultra sensitive nub that's now at the very back of my belly button.,12Jun2019,0

35,"During the day I work as a sales associate always talking with customers and coworkers and I feel like I put on a facade. I try and be optimistic and friendly and happy and crack jokes to brighten other peoples days and a lot of people would look at me and think I’m a pretty happy guy. 

I’m also an extrovert, I love being around others and being in groups. I feel energized and refreshed when I can be around others for a long period of time (minus work). Then I get home at the end of the day. 

It’s the middle of summer I’m only taking one class this summer semester and have a lot of time outside of class and work to do whatever I want. The problem is nothing interests me. Nothing at all. 

A friend from back home started a Minecraft server for old times sake and that was fun for the first two weeks but now I’m bored and disinterested. 

The YouTube channels and Netflix shows I normally love watching feel like they have no meaning anymore. 

Friends that I loved hanging with and staying up till the crack of dawn playing video games with have slowly drifted apart. One of my best friend lives 3 hours away and I haven’t hung out with him since November and haven’t played video games with him in about 4 years. 

I live with my other best friend but he’s really introverted and keeps to himself most of the time. 

Every night when I get home and can stop putting on that customer service face and stop trying to brighten other’s days I just feel numb. Nothing interests me, no one talks to me, no one wants to do anything and I’m just sitting here scrolling through reddit and watching 3 year old vines on YouTube. 

I’ve gone to a doctor to check out some insomnia that I’ve been experiencing and she said it’s most likely caused by moderate depression and she gave me a sedative to help me sleep at night. It would constantly plug my nose and made me uncomfortable so I’ve since stopped taking it (about 3 months ago). My sleep is a bit better now just trying to regulate a sleep schedule and I’ve tried my hand at starting to work out. But I still feel numb. 

I feel like there’s no point right now, no objective, no reason to enjoy anything. Nothing interests me and the few things that would make me feel anything are hard to come by because it relies on others. 

I’m constantly living in the past and have no interest in the future. I just wish things were like they were 2, 3, or 4 years ago but with the path my friends and I are on I can only see things getting more depressing for me in the future. 

I’m not suicidal just numb and stuck in a constant state of boredom is all. I just want to live life but I’m stuck on the same boring ass uninteresting routine and once I graduate from college I’ll be in a desk job stuck in another boring ass routine until I’m old enough to retire and then I’ll die.

36,"My grades in math for the most part, have always been average to above average, but this semester it has fallen to a measly 40%. Compared to my grade 9 math mark, it is a 42% drop, which me and my parents find astounding. I feel that I can’t learn the topics this year because my teacher will teach a lesson in 15-20 minutes and then give us homework for the lesson that I cannot understand. There is now no way I can bump up my grade over 50% as I only have the math final, and it is not worth enough ,(and I would have to ace it). I don’t have the time to go to summer school because of commitments to my summer job, and sports. I have no idea what I am going to do.",12Jun2019,2
37,"I couldn’t exactly describe it, but of course I didn’t fall in love in a hour, I’m just french and cannot phrase it better.

It was around 1 AM, I would chat with people on Omegle, wearing funny glasses to make people laugh. All of them were laughing, but not her. I’ve met a lot of interesting people, a lot of wholesome ones, but no one was really intriguing, but her.

I’m not crazy, I know I was probably another guy. Everyone is there waiting to find a girl to show her their dicks or just talk. But everything was so perfect I needed to share it. I have no friend, that’s why I’m here.

She was in her room, pink walls, paintings she’s done behind her. She didn’t want to talk, didn’t like her voice, but she was listening to music. The music volume was perfect, not too low, not too high, the music was perfect. The bands were so good, the songs were amazing. Artic Monkeys, Neon Trees... It felt so good, it felt like summer, and it’s summer.

She talked about her life, her boyfriend broke up with her, he doesn’t want to talk to her anymore. She talked about her job, about her friends, about her dog. She showed me pictures, sang over a song, smiled, laughed.

She was so beautiful, I couldn’t get over it. I was making jokes and was always waiting for her to smile, it worked a times and it would feel so great.

The little I’ve seen of her, she was perfect.

She then had to leave, I wouldn’t ask her for her number or instagram, I wanted to look cool and just let it go.

She said we might gonna meet again, I hope it’s true.

She told me I looked like a Reddit guy, and told me it was a compliment (well), she guessed right and I sent her my username. It was at the beginning of the conversation, but I’m hoping she remembers it and see this post someday.

I’ll have her name in my head for a long time, damn.",12Jun2019,1
38,"The moment I completed my graduation in business administration I knew I am not motivated to be in this field. The naive 17 year old had taken the decision to study business administration because of financial security. My coursework had a specialization of information system management so I got a good exposure to computer science side of it and I loved it. My grades were far better in computer science subjects than business side. At the time of graduation, the few electives I had, I chose from business side because I was afraid that I will not land a job if I opt for computer science side. After getting my first job in banking, I knew I'd make my parents proud and achieved a higher social standing over my friends and relatives. The pride melted rather quickly and I frantically started looking for a way to find a job at some software house. Living in a third world country, I soon realized that there was a reason people were moving away from information technology side. These software houses were nothing but off-shore call centers or some shady businesses making websites. The working conditions looked horrible; most of these software houses were opened in home in residential areas and paid peanuts (perhaps they didn't make much themselves). Then life kicked in. Marriage, kids, deaths took away all my focus. Until few years ago when I thought may be I could study again and change my career. For last 2 years I explored all options to go abroad and study but with family and responsibilities all my efforts couldn't yield any result. I was today trying to chat with a university admission office and didn't wanna use my regular email account (they spam you with so many degree offers that you can never get admission - so you get spam and depression bundle). That's when I tried to create another username only to realize I use to have it long time back. I opened it up and there were emails I'd sent myself of all the links to IT jobs. I have grown tired to telling myself that I'll make it some day so thought to offload some of my thoughts here.",12Jun2019,1
39,"Back in highschool I really liked a girl who very much didn't like me back. We we're both women, and both gay, but that wasn't the problem. She cited that she wouldn't date me because I was white- though I don't think that was the complete truth. She said to others that I was a creep, and while it hurt to hear, she was right. I was angry and upset for a long time, and lashed out at her in a passive agressive manner. It got so bad that she never spoke to me again after I tried to apologize. It's one of my biggest regrets that I acted so poorly, but I used that regret to change myself, and I'm so proud of that.

I went to therapist to talk about my behavior, find the root of it's cause, and improve myself. By the time I gto to college, I grew to be more sociable, and I no longer had to worry about my behavior. While I am by no means perfect, I can happily say I like who I am and no longer behave like a messy, uncommunicative child. I've found friends, interests I'm passionate about, and my biggest feat: a girl I like. While I am still afraid that I may come off creepy, she seems to care about me a lot. Even if she doesn't reciprocate, I am more than happy having her as a close friend.

I haven't forgotten about the girl in highschool, in fact, the reason I'm typing this all out is because I unexpectedly spotted her at my city's Pride parade and couldn't help but feel waves of guilt crash all over me like they did back then. But I know I'm a better person now, that I've changed myself to ensure I never treat anybody like how I treated her, and it won't happen again. I won't let it happen again, and I am proud to say that I've learned how to grow from my mistakes and move on from them. Is that weird to be proud of?",12Jun2019,2
41,"So, during my class, my instructor was talking about informal academic engagements outside class and he gave an example of how people would not be able to speak on a particular issue if told to do so to encourage us. All this while I had some inputs to add to the discussion and was well read about the issue he told about but the thing is I am so terrified to speak and introvert that I couldn't gather courage to speak when I had strong arguments to counter the narrative. This has been a problem with me for a long time and I believe that it has made me miss crucial opportunities. Earlier, I would comfortably ignore all this but now it's bothering me and I cannot do anything about it. This isn't self-pity. It's just a rant because I have nobody to talk about it.

42,"I’m 21 F, going to college in the upper Midwest. I met this girl. Let’s call her Amy. We met Halloween of 2017 and I immediately thought she was different and cool. The reason she’d came to the hangout was because my friend Will, knew Amy’s boyfriend Darren. (Before I continue, these are all fake names. Duh.) Darren and Amy have been dating for 4 years now. 

Anyways. Amy and I started hanging out more when Summer 2018 rolled around. We bonded quickly and flirted constantly. I knew I didn’t have a chance. She and Darren have a strong relationship. It became a trend of getting drunk and flirting hard with one another. She started talking about how she was not a fan of monogamy and wanted to explore her sexuality because she’s bi. I was still very closeted at this point and she was the first person I ever told that about having a strong attraction towards women. 

Before I go on, at this point Amy had and continues to have a very difficult home life. Her dad is an alcoholic and her mom and her aren’t close. At that point, she had basically been taking care of her father and had to put off going to school because of him. She loves him and was incredibly dedicated to making sure he was safe. Darren and his family have been her biggest support for the past 4 years, helping her whenever she needs it. She and Darren’s parents are close and have a great relationship that compensates for the relationship with her parents. 

Back to me and her. Amy and I continued hanging out and one night, we decided to get a hotel room so we could drink and be loud. I know it’s weird but to us, it was a great fuckin idea. It’s our moment. We can let totally loose and drink a lot. We do. Things escalate, she opens up to me about her family life more and how things have gotten harder. She opens up about how she’s developed feelings for me. I held her as she cried. I’m going to take full responsibility. I kissed her. Things escalated. Clothes came off but we didn’t go beyond kissing. It was an exchange that can be best described as a release of pent up sexual energy. 

It was the strongest I’ve ever felt for someone in a sexual situation. I felt like I was on fire. 

At the end it all, she asked me to sleep in the other bed and her last words before we went to sleep were, “I just cheated on Darren”

I felt horrible. I never wanted this to happen this way. I didn’t want to make Amy feel guilty and now I carried a guilt that weighed on me for months.

Amy and I stopped speaking for about a 5 month period. She was going through a really difficult time with her family and went off the radar, only really talking to Darren. During this period, I went on a complete sex bender. I lost my virginity a couple of weeks after the hotel and I went on to have multiple male sexual partners. I was chasing a high. It was pathetic.

Eventually, she reached out and we started seeing one another again. I apologized profusely and said that if I in any way took advantage of her in a time of weakness or sadness, I would do anything I could to make up for it.

She looked me dead in the eyes and said that she did not regret having that exchange with me and that she felt very strongly about me romantically. I’m not gonna lie, her looking at me and saying that made me giddy. I have a total weakness for her. 

We continued to hang out and I started exploring my sexuality more. Things began falling into our old cycle: drinking and flirting. 

I met a girl, let’s call her Emily, on tinder. Emily and I got along well enough and she was nice to be around. We had good chemistry and I liked talking to her. For the first time ever, I was dating a girl. Really dating a girl. It was casual and we were both still active on tinder, but she would come over to my dorm  and we would watch movies and makeout. Nothing crazy. I thought it was going well. I didn’t expect for the relationship to stretch much longer, we got along alright but I have a weird craving for intense emotional connection and I could tell that the connection wasn’t at the level I wanted it to be and it wouldn’t get there. 

Amy was still there. She encouraged the relationship and said that she was proud of me for allowing myself to date a girl. She told me she was jealous. 

Then last Friday happened. Amy and I were drinking and I honestly don’t remember how but we were cuddling (which is super weird because neither of us like physical affection much) and then we looked at each other and our lips met. This time was different. She kissed me and the exchange could be best described as sweet. The next hour was a dance of kissing one another and talking. During this talk, I told her I loved her. I didn’t even know I loved her until I said it. She told me she loved me. 

She tells me a shocking fact. She has never orgasmed with Darren and that she’s allowed a little lie to go on for four years and now it felt huge and heavy in her heart. She told me she doesn’t really enjoy sex with him but does it for his sake because she loves him. 

The thing is, I sympathized. If I found a boy that I got along with so well and was there for me so unflinchingly and loyally, I’d fake orgasms too. But that’s a huge problem, and in the future, it’s going to be more pronounced. 

I apologized again the next morning and she again said that she didn’t regret anything.

I broke up with Emily the next day. 

Now, here we are. We’re kind of in a silent agreement where we know how we feel about one another and constantly want to see each other. When I broke up with Emily, she told me she didn’t get off till 1 AM but would come over right after her shift. We never hang out that late. I had an 8 AM the next day but didn’t care. We kissed again briefly that night. 

I don’t know what to do. Darren is an amazing guy and she clearly loves him and I can say with almost 100% certainty that she will not break up with him. The only thing I can think of is to halt communication again but those months were some of the hardest of my life. I don’t want to be a scum bag that fucks over a good guy who I also consider my friend just to get the girl I want. 

If you’ve made it this far, you deserve a medal. Thank you. Please don’t roast me too hard. The journey to get to where I am has been a difficult one and I come from a home where I would be disowned if my parents found out about my sexuality. Amy is the first person I’ve had this kind of connection with and I’m scared to leave it behind even though I’m fully aware it’s the right thing to do.",12Jun2019,1
43,"I am a 31 year old male, and I just realized that I do love my body. I do get the occasional aches and pains from time to time, and I am way too skinny for my height (6'2""). 

My arms are really long and bony, but I can use them and I can move and use all of my fingers. My fingernails are nicely trimmed and do not have black nasty shit under my fingernails. My toe nails are also nicely trimmed and are a normal, natural color, and texture. Even though this is the case I refuse to wear sandals, EVER. I wash my thinning hair so it does not get too oily and smell like a raccoon's asshole. I don't get nasty shit caught in my bellybutton that builds into what looks like a mini-abortion of lint. 

I don't know why this made me feel good. But I see so many people with what I think are perfect bodies, but I do not want to take what I have for granted. I want to keep it in great condition in ways that make me happy.

I am the single income earner keeping me and my partner’s entire mortgage and bills at bay while also attempting to save money for emergencies. I try to have a social life (hah). I struggle daily with anxiety and depression but still come across as that sickeningly happy person to everyone I encounter.

But the moment I mention that I’m starting to feel even the slightest bit tired I’m greeted with a chorus of “oh stop! You’re young! You should be fine!” From the work office harpies of varying ages that somehow think that young people don’t burn any energy? Like we are actually all robots that run on some fusion reactor core and don’t actually feel human things? If that was the case we could fuck off every other type of energy production and rely solely on the bodies of “young people” to power the world.

Get fucked Karen. You don’t get to invalidate the aching exhaustion in my soul because you are past retirement age and are still working and can barely get out of your office chair without doing your hip.

He cussed and pushed me, and I was always intimidated by him (he's 6'0ish and I'm 5'6.5 but hunky). I hurt him so bad but thankfully he's not in the hospital and nobody saw, but there was blood. He was laying on the floor moaning with pain, my eyes teared up as I looked at him and I left. It was my first time hitting someone as an adult, or getting in a physical fight since the 9th grade.

I immediately got upset about if and I went to my team leader and assistant manager and refused to take their food to them I wanted them kicked out but my team leader wouldn't coz he said I can't be sure they were making fun of me. later on I had to check the toilets and I walked upstairs to girls toilets and the door opens and it was them girls I looked up and the girl that laughed earlier smiled at me, and I overheard em saying whys a boy going in girls toilets and walked past me as normal.

49,"Sometimes I ponder whether I’m depressed, because I don’t feel particularly excited about my future and I often feel ‘bored’ of everything. But then I’m also lonely, and have struggled (for the most part) with loneliness all my life, pretty much. I think loneliness can cause me to feel bored of everything; life in general seems a bit pointless when you don’t have anyone you’re really close with. I also can’t remember the last time I genuinely hugged someone. 

So yeah. I’ve had people ask me if I’m depressed when I’ve told them my symptoms, but I think it is just loneliness. It makes me optimistic actually; I’m simply reacting in a normal way to my circumstances. It would be worrying if I was *completely fine* with being lonely.

50,"Death is weird. Sometimes I would be watching some video and the topic of death would come up. 9/10 the person talking believes that there’s no after life. Sometimes when i listen to these videos I get a very awful feeling, almost like I’ve been lied to and now I know the truth except it’s 100x worse. It’s feels fucking awful, I almost can’t describe it, but it feels like I’m panicking and there’s something crushing my chest, and I would imagine how dark it would look like, then I would realize that it wouldn’t look like anything, making me feel more panicky. I can’t stand the fact that there’s nothing after this. I remember having this feeling as a young kid (only when I thought “what if there’s nothing after we die?” Because I thought that the idea of nothingness is ridiculous), but I didn’t have it as often because back then the idea of heaven was pretty much a fact. When I get this feeling I often imagine a timeline representing my entire life and then I zoom out of that timeline and eventually I get to the end and after it there’s nothing, just nothing, and I keep zooming out until the line becomes a dot, and then vanishes into nothing. The idea that I won’t be around haunts me.
I’m not in control. Summer break starts very soon, only a couple days left, which makes me look back at this year, and honestly I feel devastated. I look back and I don’t remember much, Everyday was the same, so what did I expect?

So much has changed in these months and I feel like I play no part in my life. I feel disconnected. I feel like I missed so many opportunities to socialize that everyone thinks I’m an anti social freak. I used to often zone out during classes and look around at my class mates. What are we doing here? The bell will ring and time will pass and then we are gonna do this again tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, next five years, why?

51," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. (She was saying the weird girl liked me having a joke because these girls never knew I existed before this night and the weird girl wasn’t in third night) 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her, she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit.

52,"Hello Reddit, this is my first post ever here.
I dont know where to start, maybe from the beginning: i am a latin girl who went for a year to europe, boy meets girl, they get married, went for a year to my country to meet the inlaws and then move to the husband's european country.
Everything was fine, until, i cannot explain what happened, i just, got lost, i stopped caring about myself, i thought i was beautiful because he was telling me i was (when in reality i was over 100 kilos, biggest i have ever been) i didnt seem to be able to find a job i didnt despise, so i quit ans tried to make something of my own (all of this while we were in my home country) i miserably failed, and he worked to mantain us both for a while, resenting me for not working, and just living, being a plant.
I dont know what happened, why i did that, but eventually when we moved back to his country, at some point something snapped in me (because we moved to his country, got an appartment and he continued working whilr i was just...existing) mind you, the country where i live now has one of the most complex languages in the world, so the first months (and still) i spend most of the parties sitting there understanding half of what i hear.
I snapped, and i got a job, i started losing weight, but, he snapped too, he started getting angry over everything, and all the efforts i was doing, he wasnt seeing them, we fpught a lot, i cried a lot, until he understood it and started noticing it.
But i still feel lonely, everytime we have a discussion, if i cry, i lose all credibility, and it is always because ""i am making drama"" ""this is bullshit' ""you are on your period"" ""you are hysterical"". I feel not heard, and that qhat i care about is not important to him.
I cry, i scream, i ask him to listen to me and to please care about the things that are important to me, like now, that we want to have kids (or so i thought). We have been trying for a year and i havent gotten pregnant yet, and, it is coming to a point where i am aware of every pregnant woman around, and when my friends tell me they are expecting, i just feel anger inside, jealousy, because it ia not coming so easily for me.
The other day we had a huge fight, i went to see him (he works at home, dev) and told him i need to achedule his appointment with the urologist, for, you know, exams, he got all upset, and angry that i was disturbing him. It escalated very quickly and i ended up crying and screaming, asking him if he wants to have kids or not, to what he said i think so, if they come, i will deal with it, if they dont come, i wont care. That answer broke my heart. I want a kid so much, and he is not taking seriously the infertility problem that we have, he just keeps telling me i will never get pregnant if i get frustrated, and to just wait and it will come, i am 30 years old, with genetic precedents for problems conceiving.
I am alone in this country, all i have is him, and, i dont know, i guess i just needed to vent and ask for, i dont know, kind words from strangers, i am so lost, so alone, making friends has been proven difficult, we live far from civilization and i dont drive, so i need my husband to take me places most of the time. 

I am sorry for venting this much, i am just, so.. so lonely, and i thought reddit would i dont know, listen, and, give me an advise on how to contonue living feeling so alone, or what to do, how to approach my husband, my life, everything.

I am so sorry",12Jun2019,2
53,"I'm M, 18y.o.

Being self-conscious is hard. I can't always notice things I do out of instinct. When I try to figure out my wrongdoings, I imagine myself on a podcast with myself, asking questions, speculating and so on. Sometimes there are guests in the form of me, asking questions or stating things other people say to/about me. This helped to improve my behaviour a lot, make decisions, fight with procrastination.

So not so long ago I was tasked to make some beetroot salad. Just peel some beets, salt, pepper and olive oil. I forgot about it, so the beets got spoiled. When throwing them away, I immediately start crying, feel weight on my back and try to pressure my body against itself, like impulses, instantly, my whole body shivers and ""compresses"", when I'm on my bed I roll around with my back up. This happened before, when I knew I was guilty, it goes as follows: cry, impulsively push my arms against my body, or hit them on my chest. Sometimes I make myself not do it, but catching myself amidst the swarming thoughts of dread is often complicated. It feels as though I want to harm myself (which happened once, started scratching my neck and arms real hard to blood). Every time I know I'm guilty, I get into this state.

But after I dumped the beets into the trash bin, I got on this ""podcast"" of mine, and asked myself: ""What makes you want to harm yourself when you are guilty?"". I said: ""Well, I remember I saw on ""D. Drew after dark"" they were talking about abandonment issues due to being in the incubator for too long, so maybe in very early childhood?"". I pondered for a while and...

Idk how old was I, but before I was conscious, we had a nursemaid to watch over me while my parents were at work. One day, she brought her son, who was as little as me, which obviously was against the agreement. As my parents told me, we were drawing with pencils on a reasonable distance. I pointed my pencil at her child. She considered this a threat to her kid, so she started yelling at me and of course, smacking the living shit out of my butt. The window was slightly open, my parents had just walked out of the car, and we were done with her. Just so you know, beating boys in early childhood has immeasurable consequences. So I got two-sided inguinal (groin) hernia. Can't lift, do pull ups or push ups, coughing was hard, bowel movements were, and still are painful, after the operation I had to sit and barely move for a year and so on. But the point is that I was made guilty and was beaten for it, real hard.

My conclusion is that my response to being guilty is driven from that exact situation, programmed into my brain from an early age. Suddenly pushing myself into a position of defense, really clumsy, like a baby, trying to harm myself as it was accompanied by the feeling of guilt. My brother says it's me pitying myself, or trying to get attention, but I do try to hide and make as little noise as possible. I'm trying to swap this behaviour with petting my kitty-cat, which helps the urge to cry and hurt myself die down.

This is only a thought, I don't have any psychological knowledge or research to prove this, but as they say, the first thought is the right thought, so I went with it.",12Jun2019,1

63,"I've been out on medical leave for about a week, and have just a little longer to go before I can start working again. While on leave, I had a realization. I hate my job. Don't get me wrong, I love the nature of the work, and I love the team that I work with. Those are great!

I work as one of three (soon to be two...one is leaving) sysadmins for a tech company that was recently acquired. Even before the acquisition, everything was done in a very wild west fashion. Everyone wanted to do things as fast as possible in whatever way could achieve the thing, with no regard to best practices or security. After the acquisition, and after the new owners started throwing money around, it only got worse.

Developers keep introducing bugs and throwing my team under the bus, trying to have us fix their bugs for them, and one team in particular puts in requests like ""rearchitect this system for us and have it up and running in two weeks. Testing? Nah, we'll be fine. Why do you need to consult someone on our team about our application again? We are way too busy to help you understand this thing.""

Or this gem. ""Sure we need database backups, but what about prioritizing this one shiny new thing first? We haven't had backups before, and we've been fine so far. We'll be fine a little longer. We've only accidentally deleted data from the production database once."" And when I push for database backups first, they escalate as high as they can until someone says to implement the shiny thing first.

Nobody wants to do things the right way, and everyone has unrealistic expectations about what three people can do in ultra tight deadlines. Additionally, any time I feel like I am making progress on one of my projects, something gets thrown on my lap because it's ""an emergency."" No, you having a new hire that needs to log in to this system is not a goddamn emergency. Put in a ticket and wait your turn. I am a chill person, but this is extremely stressful, and as such I am going to look at new opportunities. Been meaning to teach myself [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), so now seems like as good a time as any.

64,"Way too many of us are limiting our lives by fear, be it fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of being judged, fear of other people's opinion, fear of getting mocked, fear of getting laughed at, or any other kind of fear. Way too many of us are not living our lives to our full potential.

We all have grand dreams, we all want to succeed in every single area of life, make ton of money, be rich, famous etc. but how many of us are getting what we want? Think about it for a moment.

People are afraid of trying something new (or taking action) because they think they might fail. And they think if they fail then others will laugh at them. People are afraid of speaking in public, and interacting with other people. Reason? Fear of being judged by other people. People don't feel comfortable expressing their views and opinion. Reason? Fear of conflict. You see how this works?

Here is the truth, at least my truth: all of us can achieve all our dreams. As humans we are all equal. If one person can do it then every other person absolutely can! There is no rocket science to it.

One thing that limits us is fear. Here is some more content that explains what fear is, why we limit ourselves by it, and most importantly how one can overcome it: [https://youtu.be/z6bsLYrMtGM](https://youtu.be/z6bsLYrMtGM)",12Jun2019,1
65,"My (24M) friend (25M) made arrangements that we should have lunch. He is a bit introverted, as am I. 

The plan was to have lunch today. I didnt see him all morning so I texted if we are still having lunch. No response.  I texted again 2hrs later asking if hes ok. No response.

We live in the same dorm. I saw him later on and he spoke to me. I asked him if he has forgotten something and he looks puzzled. Apparently, he had forgotten about the arrangements and said he had turned his phone off throughout the whole day (he does that sometimes). All he said was he was unavailable. 

Would definitely be better if I had known he was unavailable. Im introverted too, but if I need to detach from the world, at least I’d let people know. I waited, hungry, for a response.

To be honest, I value the friendship. I enjoy talking to the dude. But this has really annoyed me, and eventhough my facial expression earlier shoudlve shown that I was upset about it, I was polite when I reminded him that we shouldve had lunch together as planned.

Am I wrong to feel annoyed, eventhough I understand his reason? I cant really hide how upset I am but at the same time I want to let it pass (which I cant at this time). Its hard to get a hold of this person and I got ghosted when I was supposed to be out with him.

As I typed this out, he just texted me saying that hes really sorry for not replying my text. I strongly feel like mentioning how he should be apologizing for not telling me beforehand, and that I waited for a response (which didnt come) while hungry (I waited for more than two hours hungry as to whether or not I should save my appetite for the lunch).

I immediately got upset about if and I went to my team leader and assistant manager and refused to take their food to them I wanted them kicked out but my team leader wouldn't coz he said I can't be sure they were making fun of me. later on I had to check the toilets and I walked upstairs to girls toilets and the door opens and it was them girls I looked up and the girl that laughed earlier smiled at me, and I overheard em saying whys a boy going in girls toilets and walked past me as normal.

70,"I feel like everyone is just so non-committal when it comes to their opinions of stuff. People are more concerned with trying to like as much as possible than finding stuff they genuinely enjoy. I'm not trying to go against the grain by saying that a lot of stuff people think is good IS good, but it's not great... to give an example, the HBO mini series Chernobyl was a good show, it was enjoyable. But it was undeniably unrealistic at times, and a lot of the points the show was making about bureaucracy and about the sort of David v Goliath narrative going on were overplayed and heavy handed. Chernobyl, the real event, was a fucked up catastrophe of politics, idiocy and science, and it's not hard to make a show about that that has characters we despise and characters we empathise with, given we know it's a fucked up scenario. So to that end, unlike say the Wire, Breaking Bad, mad men etc etc i just think it's an above average show, with good production and good acting for the most part. It's not groundbreaking. FUCK this has just become a rant about the show. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, no one will read this, and you mightn't think it's an important issue, and ultimately I guess it's not. But I think it reflects more widely a result of the internet, where we have way more exposure to notions of 'clout' and due to youtube and instagram and what not I think we have more access than ever to people who are popular. The upshot of this is more conformity in my view, because social media is designed to hammer into us the stuff that's most popular. I think social media has accentuated in people what was already, before all this, a strong desire to fit in. No longer is this just some quite general human trait, it's saturated our perception of the world, it's there everytime we look at our phone.

I've had thoughts about becoming just like my dad, but I'm scared of the consequences because I know I'll get so much shit for it. So, you may be wondering, what kind of dad do you exactly have and why do you want to be like him? I'll give it to you straight: he has cheated on mom multiple times, refused to get a job before he had a mild stroke (even though his health wasn't awful but the time and blamed it on depression which made him even more depressed he didn't have a job), he gets to be shirtless (because, duh, he's male), he can be as bossy and aggressive as he wishes because he's... male, etc.

Now for my reason: I want to be with as many men as I wish. **Obviously, I do not wish to have sex with any of them because I'm just in it for the fun and games**. I do not allow myself to genuinely love someone unless I'm physically male, but I'm female and *if a guy has multiple partners he's a ""player"" but if it's a female she's a ""slut""*. Both men and women get shit for cheating, but if it's a guy it's ""almost expected"". I want to make it clear I don't want to date multiple people at the same time. I'm monogamous, so instead of being in a relationship with any of them I'll just flirt with multiple people. Which isn't cheating. 

So why did I even write this post? I need advice on how to be seen as a ""player"" despite being female and I want it to be from specifically men because I don't have the ""it's because I'm visual"" card and I refuse to use the ""it's because I need love and attention"" card because it'll only get me into a genuine relationship than just for fun. **I'm just a 17 y.o. wanting to have some flirtatious fun but not sex or any of that shit**.

I haven't had health insurance for a while and I have the opportunity to get it now. But because of the ""unknown"" and ""less money""(payments) I was willing to say no to a potentially better future(mental help).

But I was helped/guided and at this time it looks like I will be getting help. Sucks that I have to go through the whole talking/trial-error thing again but if I could have a solid mind/able to interact with people and not be ""an outcast"" I think it would be worth it.

I can understand why people are upset that they are working so hard and trying to make a decent living but can’t afford a house or basic needs without going into credit card debt, but i don’t get why this would make them vote for far right or extremist candidates. Immigrants or minorities are an easy target I guess. 

I tried to read some Steven Pinker to convince myself that the world has actually gotten better, but I feel like with climate change, things will get worse.

93,"On paper, he was everything I wanted. Open-minded, spoke fluent English, multi-cultural, fun, understanding, mature, and the likes. But I wasn't happy. 

For the first 5 months I thought he was the one. I was fucking head over heels. ""How can someone we such a good fit?!"" When I looked into his eyes my heart would drop. I learned what independance was, I learned what emotional maturity was, I recognized my flaws and improved them with you. You were always patient with me. I saw a whole new perspective and side of life.

But then as time passed, things got boring. I felt that I couldn't 'connect' or bond with you. Something was wrong.. I just couldn't understand for the life of me what it was.

I put myself through some emotional hell for 5 more months. I treated myself like absolute shit. I always waited.. waited for something to change. It didn't. It was like my head kept going back and forth between ""Leave."" and ""Stay.""

I started becoming attracted to my closest guy friend. I thought he had 'more' than you. ""He listens to me and understand me better."" I thought the grass was greener on the other side. It wasnt.

A week ago, we both went on seperate vacations. The day I was coming back home, while you were still away, I called you and said ""I don't want to date you."" You took it well, you always take everything well.. Always a state of some sort of indifference. That night, I went to my best male friends house. We drank, played truth or dare, and kissed. It felt amazing. I thought, ""Yeah! This is what I want."" It wasnt. 

Awkwardness, confusion, guilt, horror consumed me. I broke down, I couldn't think straight. 

I told you the truth, that I had been attracted to my male friend and that we kissed. You were calm, understanding. You were kind to me. I was in shock. ""How can someone be so kind to the person who cheated on them?"" 

Where am I now? I cut contact with my now ex boyfriend. My closest guy friend is mad at me for telling my ex boyfriend without letting him know first and for confusing the shit out of him too.

I'm calm, not as sad as I expected. I'm excited for the future and for what it will bring. 

I learned a hard lesson. Think twice before doing anything. Listen to your gut. Be honest. Don't make decisions when emotional. Learn to recognize how you feel and what to do about it. Stop putting yourself through bullshit for no reason. Everything will be okay. You're strong and brave. You're growing.

94,"I'm sorry if this isn't the appropriate subreddit to post this but this is my first post and I actually tried to do some research to find the right place :)

A couple of months ago I went to a friend's birthday party and there was a professional photographer there. This girl would walk around and take some pictures while people were dancing, talking ecc. I was very excited about it, since I've been struggling with social anxiety and having some pictures of me taken without being aware of it was the perfect opportunity to have some new pictures of me. When my friend sent all the pictures in the group chat I scrolled through 200+ files and there were none of me. I was sad, but I didn't think much of it. Maybe she just didn't notice me and I was sure she didn't notice some other people too.

Then, three weeks ago, I turned 18 and I brought my camera at my birthday party. I didn't know any professional photographer so I just brought my own camera and left it on a table. I told everyone they could take it whenever they wanted and take pictures. I even told my best friend to take some pictures of me because, you know, it was my birthday and I had my favorite dress on. I felt pretty for once so I thought that maybe I wouldn't panic in front of a camera. Also, I needed a picture of me for a school project since I had none taken in 2019. The day after, I turned on my camera to see like fifty pictures of this girl, in different poses, smiling at the camera. She spent the evening of my birthday party with her boyfriend taking pictures of her alone. Then there were like fifteen pictures of other people, including two of me. And one of them was blurry. When that girl asked me if I could send her the pictures I felt like crying.

And finally, the other day, the last day of school, my classmate asked me if she could use my cell to take some pictures (I have an iphone 8 plus and it really takes some good photos, with portrait mode and all) and again, not a single one of me.

Reading this I realize I sound stupid, but when your self-esteem is already low, situations like these make you wonder if there's something wrong with you. That being said, I still have no pictures of me taken this year. Maybe I'm too sensitive.",12Jun2019,3

The only reason people are fooled in to thinking otherwise is because women might settle for a wealthier provider when they are getting old.

But woman absolutely care about looks. My whole life, I've been undesirable to woman because of my height, bone structure, and jaw structure.

It's not a coincidence that the guys I see who do well with women always have the right physical attributes. They are tall, buff, and have a chiselled face. The personality of the guy is completely irrelevant. You can be a niceguy, a dickhead, a boring guy, a fake nice guy. If you have the right physical attributes, you will do well with women.

Women are NOT less visual. Looks matter every bit to them. The fact that they settle with a less attractive guy LATER on after they've had their fun DOES NOT mean that they are less visual. 

Also, I get that not every girl is going to be with a Chad. Duh, there aren't that many Chads anyway. Someone will realize that they aren't desirable enough to be with one. That does not mean that looks are not important for women though. If those women had their way, they would dump their wimply looking boyfriend for a more virile, masculine guy.

I have no idea how this BS even comes up. Go on social media and you will PLENTY of women who are swooning over hot guy who they don't even know. Everyone spews this bullshit about how women need to get  to know a guys personality to be attracted and that ""WoMeN ArEnT ViSuAl"".

103," I'm just so very frustrated with being physically disabled since it feels like it gets in the way of **everything**. I understand some have it worse though.

I can't do a lot, but what I can do *a little* of is draw. However, my disability causes me extreme pain when I do artwork, so it's very difficult for me to finish something in a timely manner.

This has lead making income rough for me. I only get SSI and have to live off 9k/year. 

I thought I could earn extra income by vending my art at shows and comicons, but they don't care. They just want people with thousands of followers because it's free advertising for them when the artist says they'll be at the show.

I keep getting rejected on the reason of ""Not enough social media following."" And to be successful on social media as an artist, you have to post *everyday,* and I can't do that--then to ALL the sites too like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter!? I use up 50% of my days' energy trying to open a damn water bottle. I hate it so much.

I'm not going to do that shit then where you mass follow everyone and everything in hopes they will follow you back, then instantly unfollow them. It's an asshole thing to do.

Then the few shows I can get in, I'm ALWAYS put in the way back row since I'm not popular and have such a small following. They want to put the people in that draw the crowd to them upfront... Despite, you know, I have trouble walking and all that.

So either people just don't come to the back, or I get, ""Oh, I already spent all my money. Wish I saw this sooner."" And conventions want to be charging $300 for a table space, too. Let's just not even get into cost of travel and hotel (which I have to pay someone else to drive me and buy them food for physically helping me). In the 3 years I've been trying to vend, I've not made profit once. Only ONE show I broke even and the rest I end up in the red.

I'm fucking tired of having to skip my ramen salt filled meals.

I've tried buying followers before, but they ended up being all porn bots and questionable ages--I had to delete the account.

(They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

That other school was a rival but due to my family moving out of that district I couldn't finish there unfortunately. I think socially I would have been a lot better off at that first school. They do send me reminders for reunions which is cool because people there still remember me. At least much more so than my alma mater! Anyway the governor at the time handed me my diploma. Graduation was inside of a megachurch which I raised my eyebrows at, at the time but that's where most in the county graduated from. Our class song was Time of Your Life by Green Day. I remember having conversations a couple of years before senior year of what our class song would be. Some suggested Save The Best For Last by Vanessa Williams since we were the last graduating class of the 1900s.

112,"When I (29f) was 16 i was diagnosed with celiac disease. Years before was diagnosed with depression. I never cared about myself so i never followed a gluten free diet. Also back then it was much more expensive and all the food was gross. When ibwas about 18/19 i became a heroin addict. Depressed as ever. Barely eating and never eating right of course. At 23 i got pregnant. Drs told me methadone was the way to go to insure the baby didnt die from me withdrawling. After my daughter was born I was so excited at a chance for a normal life. Her father, my bf of 5 years, left me for another girl and drugs. So now im more depressed. After a few months i hooked up with my bf now. A super hardass who is insanely responsible somehow fell for my depressed drug addict self. He helped me get off methadone and raise my daughter. He was with through the detox, through even worse depression. Before I was off for a year i relapsed. After a few months he caught me. Helped me through detox again. He even took a week vacation from work to stay with me. And i went right back to drugs. Few months later he found out again and Kicked me out. I went 4 hours away to stay with my best friend for 2 weeks and she helped me get clean. He packed all my stuff and was ready to say goodbye forever. But he had my daughter since her father is not around. After lots of talking we decided to try one more time when i got back home. This time i would work on being healthy all around. Including my gluten free diet.

Its been a year and a half since ive been drug free and gluten free. After going gluten free my depression has gone away. Apparently thats one of the big side effects of celiac and eating gluten. And im just so so happy. I love him for staying and believing in me. He pressures me to be better. But knows my limit so i dont get overwhelmed. And im just so damn proud of myself.

115,"I’m 17 going to be a senior in high school. I wake up, exercise, eat right, have friends and family who care about me, a roof over my head, what can I possibly be un easy about? 

you know, growing up, I had it different than others. I didn’t consciously realize this, but i had to grow up early. We had a pretty wealthier family at the time . Dad made good money, so did my mom, but problems started to come up. My middle brother started having drug problems, my mom and dad argued and filed for divorce, my mom and i had to move. I’ve seen stuff, i grew up with this. But by any means i don’t want to change anything. these experiences shaped me into the person I am today and because of that, i see the world completely different.

here’s where i feel a disconnection

everyone around me, their lives, their personalities, they are very different than mine.The other dudes seem cocky and have the rich white boy vibe , while most of the girls are very “bubbly” and  spoiled. They have their lives planned out, not by them, but by their parents. college and everything will be handed to them, just like every thing in their lives.

I’m not like that. Of course my mom provides essential things for me, if i want clothes, personal items, or anything else, i work and earn that for myself. Another thing, i have a plan for myself. No one told me how to live my life, and i made something for myself. I want to enlist into the Navy. I’m not living my life for the salary, Money can go fuck itself. I do want to be stable however, but i know i’m smart enough to earn that. I just want to learn to be a stronger  person, and be a good man one day. 

I don’t know if that’s just this area that i’m living in where people are spoiled and only have their one opinion and that’s if u don’t get a degree, u ain’t shit. It’s harder to explain how i’m feeling with just words, but it’s all coming together to effect me. Even with my best friends who I fucking love, that disconnect is sometimes there. With girls too, like I can like someone but that’s all just frosting on the cake, and no one seems to be at least semi mature. All of this just bugs me so much sometimes because I truly feel like i’m a good person and my surroundings make me feel lost, or like i’m a floating bag in the wind.

I have considered cardio and strength training for energy, but after a brief period of high energy, I crash and immediately want to take a nap. 

As for concentration I have been considering experimenting with ADHD meds to see what happens. I really do think I might have a mild form of it. I have also been looking at mental techniques to keep my concentration while working. 





I'm naturally lazy. Been a complete NEET for half a year now. Currently searching or employment. 

At my second-to-last place of employment, I found myself stuck in a cycle of work/eat/sleep It's been like this for all previous jobs and I'm starting to wonder if this could be a medical condition or maybe I'm really out of shape. My job was Tech Support for an MSP. It was a good job but impostor syndrome kicked in and felt like I was a hair away from being fired at any moment.

Before that job I had racked up ~$20k in debt.
Minimum payments were eating up half my earnings and then family back home needed money, so I sent what I could. 

I knew what I had to do, but what did I do? I quit, ignored my CC's and loans, let them go to collections, let my services be disconnected for non-payment, ignored my lease and moved back home. 

I did the math and figured that to pay off my debt I would have to take up a second job and work hard for a little over a year and only then would I be starting from zero. I could not see myself pulling through for so long and saw many opportunities for me to screw up and end up in a vulnerable position.

After a month of staying home and doing nothing, I decided to apply for a call center job. Pay was great, hours were great, and we had paid training. After training we were allowed to talk on the phones and I immediately tensed up with anxiety I carried over from the previous job. I couldn't bring myself to walk into work after that. I made a BS excuse that their metrics were unrealistic and stayed at home doing nothing for 5 months.

Now I see my family struggling and want to contribute money for bills and rent. I am currently applying for overnight jobs because they have less competition and are calmer than day jobs.

Before I go back into the workforce, I want to take a good look at my mistakes and how to fix them. I guess the main ones are that I have zero energy after work and even with energy I can't use it properly to be productive afterwards.

For years I chose to keep it to myself because no one ever takes me seriously, but as I was becoming more open and trusting, I told him about it and he was understanding. But he did trigger me again. I told him again in the moment not to do that, which he apologized for. I told him later in the day as well through text because it had gotten to me so much that no one ever takes me seriously about it and it was really disappointing that he seemed not to.

I went on a rant actually. I am really careful about my words so I made sure I wasn't blowing up on him or guilting him. I told him what happens to me when I get triggered and asked him to please take it seriously. 

He then ignored me for days. Until he finally told me why, he didn't appreciate my message. I don't exactly remember why, but he read into it and took it the wrong way. I do however take responsibility that my wording wasn't the best still.

They could also use catchy slogans, like ""no fetus can beat us"", ""you make them we scrape them"", or ""edit-&gt;undo."" They could also use catchy names, like Fetus Deletus or Unscrew. 


A clinic could have some abortion humor displayed inside, such as a poster with a cartoon that depicts an abortion clinic with Pizza Parlor inside that has the motto ""your loss is our sauce."" Or a sign that says ""Why did the fetus cross the road? Because the dumpster got emptied.""

In the recovery area, after the drugs have worn off, they could have drinks and a bar area for patients. With a fun party atmosphere.",12Jun2019,0
126,"I’m a high school student by the way, this isn’t a job interview. But it’s a leadership opportunity that I really want to be a part of, and right now I’m sitting in the car typing this post. I’m not nervous, for some reason. I’m just sorta relaxed and telling myself they’ll accept me (delusion?). I’ve done absolutely horribly in every past interview for school clubs or asb or something like that, so I’m really not sure how I’ll do on this one. But what makes this interview different from the other ones is that it’s a leadership position in a field that I’m ACTUALLY interested and passionate about, and I’m also strangely relaxed about it. 


Maybe I’ll update on how it goes. Good luck to me.",12Jun2019,3
127,"I (F26) have always struggled with trying to feel happy and fulfilled. Ever since I was a teenager I felt like I didn't fit in and didn't belong in the life I was living. Like I was supposed to be somewhere else and someone else. I have tried to change my life several times through changing schools and living abroad for a while. However, these changes in my life never changed the way I felt. A few years ago I realized that it wasn't my surroundings causing me to feel this way, but that it is the way I see myself and the world nevermind where I am. This hit me like a ton of bricks and I got very depressed. I took medication and therapy etc and the depression is gone but I still feel the same as I did before my depression. 

I just have no idea where to start and what to do in order to find happiness and fulfilment from within myself, because looking for it outside of myself hasn't worked. 

Is there anyone who can relate and maybe has some advice for me?",12Jun2019,2
128,"Not only am I gaining weight, but my room is a mess and I haven't showered in days. I am about to shower, shave, clean my room, create a workout plan, and some more self care to make up for my neglect. wish me luck",12Jun2019,6
129,"I can’t say asshole because they’re not good enough to be that but I post one thing and they’re rude as fuck which I’m sure a lot of people know. I look at other people’s post and they post a simple question like what are shades of blue and some person has to give an ignorant answer. It’s just not that deep to be rude. Yet, I find it amusing so I don’t mind having irrational debates or being a asshole myself. A lot of times someone can just say lol and it’s triggers them to another crude response. Beautiful isn’t it!!! What do you think? I know it’s the internet but sheesh it does put a smile to your face sometimes from the responses haha.",12Jun2019,9

132,"I'll often think about stuff that might give me trouble in the future, and instead of preparing for it mentally I usually just push it out of my mind again. Especially when it comes to relationships to be honest, I am definitely not looking forward to anything academic either, but finding a person I love currently seems like the most unrealistic thing! As of now I never struggled a lot academically, but I was never in a relationship for which I can't blame anybody but me. I think about how I could meet girls and how I should&amp; act quite often, but quickly just push those thoughts away and think to myself ""Nah, I can't do it anyways so why even bother thinking about it"". I am sure some of you might know that feeling too. Just when I am about to plan things and maybe search for some tips I'll throw everything away (This also applies to tons of things throughout my daily life too btw, especially when it comes to stuff on the computer) and retreat to the comfort of staying at home or with my close friends. If I continue the way I currently do my future looks rather grim I guess, but it's so damn hard snapping out if this behaviour!

Honestly not really looking for dating tips or anything because of the things I mentioned, so please don't waste too much time in case you wanted to write a detailed comment haha. Just wanted to get it off my mind before going to bed. Thanks for reading in case you got this far!",12Jun2019,2
