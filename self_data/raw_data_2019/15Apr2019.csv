0,"I’m not sure who I am anymore. When I’m alone I’m into older guys not into guys my age(young) but when I hang out with my guy friends I just become straight and when I hang out with my lady friends I feel like I’m Asexual. This is very confusing. But I guess I would prefer older men. If my parents were to find out about this I don’t know what I’m going to do I feel so paralyzed every time I think about them knowing the truth.  I don’t want to see the disappointment in my parents eyes because I’ve seen that look and it hurts me more than it hurts them. I’m just a stupid teenager who asked a teacher for help. He was the first person I’ve ever came out to I’ll never forget my first 02/28/18. I told him how I tested my mom to see if she would accept me so I told her that I was asexual and she said that something was wrong with me and that she wanted me to go see a priest or some shit and I started crying in his room because I told him that my mom would never accept me if I came out different and I was hurt because my mom is my best friend. I couldn’t even look at my teacher in the eye I was so embarrassed because I was different but when I looked up he also was crying and I felt this deep emotional connection and I guess I caught feelings for him and I know it’s wrong but I can’t stop thinking about him. By the end of the year he told me to contact him in any way if I needed anything. I did and I got no answer from him only to come to the beginning of school and find out he doesn’t work there anymore he was offered a job as a counselor at a different school. I felt so crushed to find out by one of my classmates. I felt abandoned I felt like he was trying to avoid me I just couldn’t deal with it. When left I didn’t know who to turn to so I turned to a social worker in my school and I started talking to him but one day I came in and he told me to stop being a chicken shit and to go see a therapist. I’ve didn’t go see a therapist and on that day I was hurt by him and form this day I haven’t gone to go see him but sometimes I see him in the hallway he says hi but I just nod my head.
I started to smoke weed and now I’m admitting to myself that I’m addicted and I don’t want to be and I tried cutting back but it’s everywhere. There was one day when I smoked sativa and I felt like my heart was going to stop because it was beating so fucking fast and it scared the living hell out of me. I stopped smoking for a month and then continued to do it again what is wrong with me. I feel like this is my social workers fault but mostly mine. I was pushed away by my social worker but I guess I pushed myself away. My mom found my electronic cigarette and she wasn’t mad she just gave me that look of disappointment I felt like I let her down and that I broke her, every time she try’s to bring up the conversation I can’t look her in the eyes because if I do she’s going to cry and I don’t want to see her cry I don’t want to hurt her. 

There’s not a day that goes by mind about running away I just want to get away from everyone I don’t want to see anyone I know. My doctor started to give me mood pills (Lexapro) it’s been a month and I feel so numb hell I can’t even admit that I have depression and anxiety. I just hate those words so much. 

My parents are arguing a lot at home they said that they might get a divorce but the only thing holding them together is because my brother is 6 and he needs both his mom and dad. I’m the middle child 16 almost 17. And my sister is the oldest she is 22 and she is deaf i always have to get her food help her with communication in society and etc. I have to take care of my brother while my mom workers on the weekends because my dad gets pissed that he takes care of my brother he gets so mad that my mom is always working and that he takes care of my brother for two fucking days it’s his fucking son I take care of my brother everyday. Something is definitely wrong with my dad he’s such a dick. But yeah I have to take care of both my siblings everyday and every time I want to do something like hang out with my friends My parents put their needs first my dad wants to party with his friends and my mom goes to work and my sister doesn’t even take care of my brother properly so it all comes down to me and I’m so tired that my needs always come second. 

Why am I the one to always fuck up, get hurt, or that sometimes there’s always something wrong with me it’s always me. I feel like I’m annoying people by just talking about this I find my self annoying by talking about my pain maybe I should just..............",15Apr2019,5

3,Yesterday I accidentally dropped my phone in a bucket of water. It was fully submerged for a few seconds but I pulled it out and immediately shut it down. Then I took it out of the case and just let it sit and air dry for a little over 24 hours and it ended up being completely fine.

4,"I haven't written something negative in a while, I assumed it was because I was getting better, but recently my sense of self has vanished entirely. It's not easy to be honest when someone asks me about myself, because as much as I'd like to tell them, I don't know myself either. ""So what do you want to do after university?"" The only answer that feels remotely honest is simply ""To be happy"".

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot remember my past at all, I know that I was bullied, I know that I was miserable, but I do not remember any of it; that trend seems to have continued into current days too. Without knowing who I was, or who I am now, it's very hard to think of who I want to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that when I think of the things that would make me happy the only image that comes into my mind is one that encapsulates a significant other, an unbreakable relationship, and a mutual respect. I have this image in my mind of my wife/girlfriend/significant other under one arm, a big floppy dog under the other, and a sense of tranquility and calmness.

&amp;#x200B;

To me, this all comes from a place of feeling understood, I know that ""The One"" for me is someone who understands me, respects me, and loves me entirely, and I do the same to them. The one person who I am totally emotionally available to, nothing held back, and they are the same; But that is as much as I know about who I want to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Where and how do I start to grab back that sense of self, because the longer I miss it, the larger the leap onto that first stepping stone seems to get; and I don't want to wait so long that I can never make it back. I'm not sure what to do, and I don't know who to ask, but I want somebody to help me, otherwise I don't see much point in life the way it is.",15Apr2019,1
5,"Since I found this site and so many amazing subreddits, I have been excited and happy, and it seems I have spent hours here.  I have only seen one thing that made me think, ""Hm.  There must be a history with this poster to get that kind of reaction...""  In all the other posts, I have found the people to be helpful, friendly, creative - all the qualities I enjoy about us humans!

I told my step-daughter I was looking at Reddit.  She thinks this is not a good place.  I won't delve into that any further, I just thought it was an interesting difference.

I remember a show from decades ago.  It was either a Showtime series, or an HBO series.  The main character's mother was a complainer, and his step-father was always positive.  One of the episodes was set in December.  The mother appeared and would not stop complaining.  She was wearing high heels, in the snow, the taxi driver didn't pull up close enough, there were all the gifts to carry, up all the stairs, didn't he pay enough rent for an elevator...  She hardly took a breath between complaints.  Her husband came through the door, dusted the snow off his shoulders and said, ""It's a winter wonderland!""

My cake day is April 5, 2019, so maybe I don't have any way of knowing how things will go, or what I will find.  All I can say for the moment is that I am happy to share time and space with you.",15Apr2019,4
6,"Last year I had sex with a prostitute for the first time. I had a lot of guilty feelings after (I have been single the past 2 years). Never did it again until this weekend.

I ended up at a strip club with some new friends and took one of the girls there home with me for sex. I live in a country where it is legal but still feel bad about it.

Today I'm feeling very down about it and brings back memories to my experience last year. I drank a lot but it is my fault for not seeing past that. 

I've been single for the past year and it was my first time having sex since the last time I saw a prostitute and now I remember why I didn't do it again for so long. I'm really shy when I meet people and it usually takes me 5+ dates to get out of my shell so it's hard for me to meet women who want to continue seeing me even though I tell them I am shy at first. I have been like this since I was a kid.

9,"It'll be so much easier if you know a little about me.

Male late twenties, like a 6 out of 10, higher if i'd never smoked weed. Got a dog but she doesn't live with me, she's about 30 minute walk away at my mothers. Haven't worked for 2 years except for a christmas job I did recently. Not really pshyically fit but i'm open to the suggestion.

I'm bored. If i'm not bored i'm hungry &amp; if i'm both i'm depressed. When I first started this facade I call my life it seemed so simple. All I had to do was play my favourite video games, eat food, smoke weed; rinse repeat. My plan was to never live past 30 and that plan is obviously out the window because i'm not crazy. So now I might have an oppourtunity to go back to college which leads to university, that's cool it starts in August. Gives me some time to get things ready, right? Thinking of going into science mainly chemistry, it interests me. Honestly, I am not going back to education so that I can 'get a better job' or get a magnificent job one day. It's the wrong attitude but the way I see it is my life isn't going to be much different than when I used to say ""I won't make it past 30"". The difference is now I have more time to kill. 

I do genuinely want to study, to learn - for fun. If it leads to a nice job one day that'd be a bonus - but that is not the plan. I have no intentions of ever being rich with money, just rich with happiness. That being said, because of my mental health (oh boy):-
Dissosociation, depression, paranoid schizophrenia, psychosis.

......Because of my mental health, I would never be required to look for or get a job. That means I live off of the government on what I can only describe is liveable nothing more nothing less. It's fine if you don't care about money or posessions. If you want lots of money and a nice car well you better stop having mental health problems and get a good paying job. Literally.

I hate talking about my mental health, please don't comment asking questions or just anything about it really, it's a burden I don't need and would gladly drop if it wasn't attached to my god damn body. It is what it is.

The hardest part is the depression, the rest of it is fine literally doesn't bother me. But with depression.. Today I woke up, I lay in bed for like 2 hours (sounds really nice right) - it's not nice. I stayed in bed for hours because I had zero motivation to get up, it's like that every morning. It hurts rather than it feeling nice. You wanna do things but everything you think of is shot down. 

""I have no food i've got no energy I can't be arsed it's too far what's the point it doesn't matter""

back to bed.

Did, literally, nothing, all day. I logged onto world of warcraft and healed some stuff for about 40 minutes. I spent a whole day just feeling like I can't and won't do anything. It's not just having no energy it's having no motivation and the two combined just completely destroy me. It's depressing.

###I want to cry###

Let me cry god damnit. You know why I want to cry?

I know that when you cry it releases 'feel good' chemicals to or from your brain. That's why chemistry fascinates me, that's why I want to go back to study. That and I have nothing to do.

The thing is it's not as if yesterday was the first day this happened oh no. It's been like this now for... It's been a year and 10 months since I moved out and I was like this for over a year before I did move out. It's been like this too long.

Give me advice. Give me something to do. Take my depression away, give me motivation. I could go jogging most days with my dog and lift weights on my off days, sometimes that gives me some motivation to just, be alive and happy. Makes me feel accomplished throughout my days. I've thought about microdosing LSD recently, read alot about it, tested it a couple months ago. It ""worked"". The same way giving steroids to a skinny person would make them big, it worked. Once they stop taking the steroids/once I stop microdosing the depression just comes back.

God I said I didn't want questions about mental health and i've just rambeled about depression for the past seven paragraphs. I'm sorry. 

I'm just so bored, I have no friends - my family doesn't want anything to do with me. I dunno. I just wanna feel less shit every day. Just a little bit better would be nice I don't have to feel perfect but I get to this point at night where i'm actually exhausted over nothing, but too annoyed at nothing to sleep -

10,"Obligatory on mobile, also not sure this is the right subreddit for my rant, but here goes.

I really hate the town I live in. On top of there being nothing to do here, I’ve noticed that a lot of the people here suck or don’t do anything with themselves. I honestly didn’t notice until I moved across the country, lived in a great city for 5 years but had to move back because depression and student loans. When I moved back I noticed a lot about the people that live here. Everyone is so judgmental. Once when I went to buy drinks for a family party, I was laughed at and called an alcoholic by an EMPLOYEE of the store. I’ve also heard other snark remarks but nothing as serious as that. If I don’t go into town dressed up and either with makeup or at least looking like I spent more than 10 minutes on my appearance, people will stare at me like I’m disheveled. If I’m sick, that makes it worse, and people will stare at me like they think I’m some sort of weirdo or drug addict. Since I live alone and have no interest in dating here, people make comments about me being a hermit and the like. Pretty much, if you don’t fit the “norm” you’re being judged.

Now, I kind of just let this fester into my social anxiety and came to terms with the fact that I’ll probably stay here for another year. However, today a friend of mine posted on social media that while he was out for a jog, several people stopped to roll their windows down and yell “f*g” at him and make other homophobic comments. He’s told me stories of similar things happening when he goes out to bars, but for people to yell that stuff in broad daylight while the person is out for a JOG?! Not saying it’s okay at all, but a bar or similar environment you can leave. Enjoying the weather and going for a jog? Come on, let the dude live! That was the straw that broke the camel’s back for me. Yes, it didn’t happen to me but it made me realize that people are so backwards here, this environment is never going to change.

Outside of that, I’m starting to not like my family so much. My mom, stepdad, and their family members are Trump supporters. And yes, that means there is a lot of misogyny and other bigotry in my family. Also, my mom’s family grew up really poor. Now, they’re all doing well financially. I’ve always looked up to the fact that they’ve bettered themselves in that aspect. So, it really pisses me off that some of my cousins decided to reverse that. I’m talking multiple baby daddies, other cousins deciding to have another kid even though they’re on welfare and spending their tax refunds/going into credit card debt because DISNEYLAND AND OTHER VACATIONS. Even when their parents get on them about their financial situations, they continue to make the same mistakes. Them being poor doesn’t bother me, but them making bad decisions and not learning from them really pisses me off because it makes them seem so childish. They also play the “poor me” card and make it seem like I have it so good (which I do) and try to make me feel bad for them. Yes, I do realize you’re in a shitty situation, but I’m not gonna feel bad for you and help you out because you did that to yourself. It also bothers me that a lot of my family doesn’t take time to visit my grandma, who has Alzheimer’s and dementia, and doesn’t have that much longer to live. One of my cousins has two toddlers and a baby, so it’s understandable it’s hard for him to come over because of that, BUT I once heard his wife say she wished they could visit my grandma more but they don’t live close so it’s not possible. THEY LIVE HALF AN HOUR AWAY AND SHE SAID THIS WHILE THEY WERE IN TOWN FOR A KID’S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

All of this really makes me want to move away, but I feel like I’m stuck for at least another year. On top of the situation with my grandma (my mom and I take care of her once a week), I may have a major surgery this year and it would be way easier to do it here where all my family is, and my parents are a five minute drive away.

Rant over. I was just so upset about what happened to my friend that I started having some depressing thoughts about this shitty area I live in and the fact I feel like I can’t leave just yet.",15Apr2019,1

My best friend moved across the country for missionary work and I’m almost never allowed to talk to him due to the strict ass Mormon rules. He’s gonna be gone for 2 years. I also have another close Mormon friend who moved to another part of the country, and the same thing applies; I can almost never talk to him. 

I have 2 other friends who are my age from high school. One of em I rarely see, and we’ll sometimes play hockey together but that’s about it. The other guy is an extremely close friend of mine and the only person my age who I regularly hang out with.

Tonight I’m gonna hang out with 2 fellas who are a few years younger than me and it’s just kinda weird. They’re still juniors in high school while I’m a freshman in college, which isn’t inherently strange, it’s just that they’re rather immature. I feel like a bum if I hang out with them too much, but they’re ALWAYS asking me. 

I haven’t really made any friends in college. There’s a group I work with in one of my classes regularly, and although they’re cool, that’s about it. I haven’t MADE a solid friend in over seven years. And that same guy ended up spiraling into drugs and we rarely talk anymore.

I (20F) met him (20s?M) 2 yrs ago in the summer. i took a walk with him and his daughter , explored a forest and shit like that. Went home...didn’t hear from him very much after that. He would hit me up every couple months and then he would ghost me so i was like whatever over it.  But 8-9 months ago he started calling me over and over again. I was mostly at work and not answering my phone. I would get on it and there would be 3 missed calls from this guy. His number wasn’t even saved in my phone so i always forgot who it was.  He was asking to see me over and over again so finally i was like fuck it come over and smoke. He came through and we smoked and talked. Nothing sexual happened, he was super shy. AND he pulled up with a skinny ass blunt (mine was bigger) but anyways. He left and i didn’t hear from him for a little bit but soon enough my phone was blowing up again. “I need to see you” “Please let me come over”. Frankly it was annoying me. I don’t like clingy and i hate when people call me repeatedly when i don’t answer, ask my sister. Obviously i had a little crush on this boy but the whole ghosting thing is a big turn off so i stopped fucking with him. He hung out with me probably 3-4 times in total. Never had sex. Never kissed. I’m including that because i just want to be clear that i never did anything to cause him to become obsessed with me. Now if i had given him pussy...i would understand the obsession ;) Anyways i ended up getting involved with something else and I told him and he was pretty butt hurt over it. I didn’t really care. Didn’t hear from him till January of this year. I got off work to see like 7 calls but some of them were from his number and some were from “unknown”. That’s fucking weird. He was texting me too, asking to see me and saying he missed me. I said i’m good. To be blunt there was nothing wrong with him or anything i just wasn’t interested anymore. He said he just wants to be friends. “sorry i’m not comfortable w that” because i’m not. At this point i was so over it that i didn’t respond after.  As the days went on he was texting me over and over “good morning beautiful” “hey” “how’s your day”. i HADNT responded to any of them. I answered 2-3 calls from him, always making sure to have an excuse for why we couldn’t hang out , even as just friends and why i could never text him. (i hate confronting people) I had to block him. Then the unknown calls started. Spamming me. I answered and it was him. I was just fucking annoyed. Dude take a hint. He’s oblivious to the fact that i’m trying to avoid him.  I chose not to answer any more calls from the unknown number. The calls continued. I don’t know if there’s a way to block that shit , it doesn’t really bother me i just press decline. Fast forward to February , new number texted me. Guess who. We have a small conversation through text about my birthday and how i had “missed his birthday and owed him” uh ok. Ignored his texts after that. He didn’t stop. Blocked him. Unknown calls continue. Another new number and it’s him again. Ask him to stop talking to me. He says he just wants to be friends, i said i’m not comfortable with that. He argues. Block him. Fast forward to now and i got interrupted while writing this by an unknown call. advice ?",15Apr2019,1

28,"By the end of february, I had sent the first draft of my research project to my professor for evaluation; I was alone at my internship, handling an important project that is going on after years in the company; I talked to a teacher, who is coincidently one of the founders of said company and enrolled in a class he was assigned to. Everything was going really smoothly: my rythym in studies and work was great, with nothing to worry.

Then the meeting happened. I did not meet my professor's expectations, with a lukewarm response to what I had written. The class, which I thought would be easy since it was related to my work, became really dense, and I lost track of everything; in the moment I looked for help from my teacher, I felt his look towards me with disappointment. Then, in work, I made an extremely common mistake that fell under a domino effect, leading to a even more disappointed boss questioning me why did I done wrong on something so easy...

I can’t watch them because they immediately make me cry and they stay with me for a while after. When I watch that kind of thing it feels like I’m the one that’s being violated. We’ve talked about it and my issue with it. 

He wants me to watch the new GOT episode with him tonight but I already know there’s going to be sex etc. 
I may have narrowed my problem with porn and sex down to older man/younger girl but almost every sex scene in GOT is a trigger for me. 

I have no idea really where this is coming from and it’s such a strong emotional response. I know some people will say I’m being way to sensitive and that I need to toughen up or stop being this or that. I’m honestly just trying to weed my way through my issue with porn and to be honest it feels isolating. I know many people watch porn and many don’t. I just feel I’m on the losing end of this porn thing. It feels so crushing to realize that it’s more normal than not. 

I don’t know how to be okay with porn or learn to not have such a strong reaction when I see certain sex scenarios on TV or in movies.

53,"This has been on my mind for a buttload of time so thought I’d made a post about it. 

I grew up heavily depressed and with severe selective mutism, among others but these 2 have always been the biggest. Back at high school I always kept to myself, never opened my mouth to the point of people thinking I wasn’t able to speak. I went on day to day, barely getting through the day. Health was sucky and so were my grades. 

Last week ish of HS I noticed my depression that had been there since I was in 4th grade started going away. A while passed and I didn’t do anything about it because I was too scared thinking it was my bipolar ass. The depression never did come back. I went onto college and majored in psychology/nutrition. Grades were pretty good except I wasn’t even “trying” 

Up to this point I was working out but ye. I went from obese to a skinny fuck. All throughout this I decided all of this wasn’t enough. One day I was in my government class and 5 min prior to us being released I got this crazy idea.... I got out, walked over to the parking lot and sat in my car. Got out my phone and called up my local marines recruiter. We met later that day and according to him I had been the easiest recruit he’s ever done due to me knowing what I wanted. 

I had changed my name and my birth certificate was still in the process of being changed. Recruiter called Washington recruiters (I’m in CA) to get the birth certificate and fax it but they were taking their sweet time. One day I said “enoughs enough” and I made the 14h drive over there to get the birth certificate. Came back and my recruiter was like “uhhh wtf?” Lmao. that Friday I went to MEPS. 

The time it took for me from the day I called up my recruiter to the time I shipped was 1.5 months. When I first talked to him I couldn’t do one pull up, by the time I shipped I was doing 8 pull ups. 

Sometime between all of this I met with my HS teacher who had always tried to help me. Emailed him asking to meet with him and he agreed. I got there and I walked past him and he didn’t recognize me at all. After coming back from the office I went back and I told him who I was. He had that “oh shit” expression. 

By the time I walked away his mind was blown. According to him 

1. I was a billion Xs more “handsome” than I ever was back in HS 

2. I had talked more in those 10 min than the previous 4 years combined 

3. I was the last person he’d ever think would go into the military, especially not the marines. 

Back to when I shipped, shit happened and I was forced to stay there for 5 months instead of 3 since I was injured and was out of training. Got depressed again, not as bad as it was before but ye. 

So, what I’m trying to say is, when I’m depressed I can’t do shit. When I’m not depressed though.. I’m a force to be reckoned with.",15Apr2019,0

56,"There are so many things to say, but I don't know how to start. My beautiful brother, my best friend, my partner in crime, my father figure, took his beautiful life last Tuesday night. Throughout all the pain and shock, I have realized **suicide is not what they teach in schools.** 

He was 27, and I am 21. We grew up with just my mom, and we were the three musketeers. He would give you the shirt off his back, put himself at the expense of a joke to make you smile, and work endlessly to help support us. He never splurged on himself- the last thing he ""splurged"" on for himself was new Duluth jeans because his previous ones had holes in them. But, whenever I asked for something there was no hesitation. He would do it for me without a second thought. He would light up the room, his sweet smile with huge dimples had a way of warming people up. His brown eyes held kindness. His laughter had the innocence of a child. His heart was gold. He was **incredibly smart.** He could do algorithms in his head. His ASVAB score was a 93. He knocked people out of cybersecurity for the AF.

He had **no** signs of what you are taught to look for when it comes to suicide. He wasn't giving his things away, he wasn't depressed, he wasn't saying 'what if I am not here' scenarios. He wasn't doing anything that was normal to his beautiful self.

Without going into details, I can tell you that suicide isn't always a long-planned thing, or a thought that constantly hangs in the back of one's mind. It doesn't have to have signs, and it doesn't have to suggest that someone was depressed. When it comes to it, **suicide is a 5-second decision.** Whether or not it was a long thought out process, or it was a five-minute decision, it only takes a second to decide.  We can't be angry at this decision, all we can do is mourn. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me end by this: I could go on and on about how terribly sad I am yet numb to the world, how I never get to do a lot of things with him now, how much I am hurting that he was hurting at the moment that much to do this. But there is a lesson here. **He was drinking Four Loko.** What is that some may ask. It's an alcoholic energy drink- five cans of beer and one cup of Starbucks coffee are inside 1 single can. My mother and I had no idea **Four Loko can lead to aggression and suicidal ideation.** If you look it up, this drink has dozens and dozens of articles ranging from how its a ""blackout"" drink to how it has lead others to hurt themselves the same way he did. **Never let anyone you know touch this drink. Never touch this drink. This drink is unbelievably evil. If you are a parent, go to 7/11 and show your child this drink and tell them how this drink led to my beautiful brother's death. This drink is liquid death.** Do your research on this drink. Have this revelation before it is too late, lord knows I would have if I had known.

I've never really wanted to get married. Growing up I watched my mother go through six divorces. I saw her heartache and sadness each time a relationship would crumble. I saw my aunt divorce her husband after he had cheated on her for years with her best friend. I watched my grandparents nearly divorce after a suspected affair and held my grandmother's hand while she cried in an Olive Garden restaurant over her fears. My entire life has been a huge red flag on marriage. I didn't think I could ever trust anyone enough to commit on that level. 

Then... he came along. Last year, we met via Tinder. Cliche these days, I know. He stood out, though. His pictures were cute and fun and different than most the men around here who only had drinking pictures or hunting photos. One of his photos was of him and his friends at a Pride parade, another was with him and his dog and this huge goofy grin on his face, and another was him with blue hair and a gaming headset on. When we matched he didn't send me a pickup line or anything perverted, he just said ""Hey, how are you?"" We talked all night, and then continued talking daily for a week before he asked me out to dinner. 

We were only together for a month when my dad died. We had gone out to the bar the night before and were hungover in bed when I woke up to my phone going nuts. My dad had been in a motorcycle accident and died on impact. My whole world shattered, I was hysterical. He called off work that night and just stayed to take care of me. He stood by my side through everything, and I think I knew at that point that it was safe to trust him. 

We have been through so much together. We've already faced so many struggles and so many blessings. Our relationship isn't perfect, no relationship is, but I'm so excited to spend my life with him and grow and learn together. We are planning our handfasting ceremony for Halloween day, and will be legally married by an officiate after the ceremony is completed. I can't wait!",15Apr2019,337

# Happiness

I am vulnerable to addiction. Isn't everyone? I have gotten this idea into my head that I get addicted more easily than most other people, but maybe that's not true.

At any rate, the internet is a dangerously gripping place to me. There has been a period in my life of at least a year where I spent most of my free time watching Hearthstone videos on YT, even though I've never even played that game. Thinking back to that time feels almost unreal. 

I've learned a lot since then. One important thing I've realised is this:

* Pleasure can be achieved through happiness, but not the other way around

This may seem a bit weird if you think of both 'pleasure' and 'happiness' as 'feeling good', pleasure in a more short-term sense and happiness in a more long-term sense. If you see it that way, it's easy to think that if you feel good all the time (pleasure), you should feel good in general, too (happiness). Most people implicitly have this assumption.

What I've come to see ever more clearly, however, is that pleasure and happiness are almost entirely different things. They're two very different kinds of feeling good. How else can it be that in modern society, we have all kinds of things that make us feel good in the pleasure kind of way, yet are still so unhappy? In fact, seeking pleasure can be bad for your happiness: by trying to 'fill the void' in doing things that feel good, what you're actually doing is neglecting the void, causing it to grow ever larger.

Seeking happiness through pleasure is a fallacy.

One other thing I've come to realise is this:

* Other people are crucial

What I now know about 'the Hearthstone days' is that I wasn't doing well at all. At the time, if you'd asked me how I was doing, I would have said I was fine, and believed it even. The bullying was over, the bullies had all failed their year and weren't on my school anymore; more importantly, I'd learned to stand up for myself, I was strong now.

Because I was ignoring them, my wounds couldn't heal.

The bullies. In hindsight, they were just a few dumb pricks who couldn't stand the fact that I was smarter than them. It seems almost comical that I ever gave a beep about their opinion of me. And what an impact they had on me! For years - years! - I fled into my addictions, separated myself from my classmates, made very few friends and pretended I was doing fine. 

But it's not that I was a fool to care so much about what they thought of me. It's simply the way humans work: we want to feel accepted, appreciated, we want to feel seen and loved. This longing for acceptance even extends to people with zero significance to us.",15Apr2019,1
65,"background: I study in a prestigious university and am in my penultimate year. I have well-off parents and have never worried about money ever in my life. 

I think I really need to answer the question of what I want to do in the future (which I thought i should be able to answer at this point). 

I have done jack shit during university, wasted my time browsing reddit and watching netflix. While I do some music stuff on the side, I have hardly studied and generally do not have impressive grades (good enough not to get kicked out, tho). 

Recently I have been applying for interns and I have realised how fucking scary the outside world is. I finally realised how HARD I will have to work in the future to maintain my lifestyle (not like I live a luxurious one, but again i never worried about money) and reach financial freedom. I am going to be working in a different country than where my parents live so that I don't have an option to rely on them. But honestly, it almost feels like I won't make it in the real world. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main question: 

I have worked before (not extensively) and I could manage it, but I have a constant pressure to somewhat 'compete' with my dad or live up to what he has done (he never went to university but is a very successful businessman, obviously worked extremely hard). He said I could do anything with my life and no matter what, I won't starve under his watch and I will have his inheritance that will feed me for the rest of my life. Rather than reassuring, it gives me a sense of failure and insecurity that I will never be as great as him (me being an extremely lazy person, always has been, never truly worked hard to achieve anything, maybe except my grades to make it to my uni). 

Whilst my interest has always been in the music industry, I understand how difficult it is to make it in there, and honestly I am not that much of a talented individual who has what it takes. 

In terms of work or industry, I have 0 idea. I am likely to be working in a commercial bank over summer as an intern, but the idea of being a small gear in a massive corporate really really overwhelms me. It feels like everything is so competitive. I used to want to be an investment banker (because that's where the money's at...) but the hours sounds horrible. 

It feels like I am giving so many excuses to my laziness or scare of doing hard, honest work. I just feel so damn useless.

About 3years ago I was together with a girl that is up until now probably the only girl I’ve ever truly loved in my life it wasn’t about looks but her personality she was just such a cute and nice girl I really loved everything about her how she talked, how she eat, her mimics when she talked just anything and I knew she felt the same we had no sex at all (even though I am a extremely horny guy) but to be honest when she was around I wasn’t thinking pervert or I didn’t felt horny at all so I didn’t care about that at all.... one day I was at her home but she left for some errands and I was alone with her mum.... {info to her mum she and her daughter were extremely close, because her dad died when he was in the army I didn’t asked for any further information because I didn’t wanted to be rude} anyway her mum looks extremely young I think she was at that time around 34 but she looked like 26 or 28, me and her mum talked for one hour or so and I tried to find a moment to break the talk and leave I mean I was in a good relationship with her mum but I felt kinda awkward, but what I didn’t realized during that time ( probably because I was so focused in leaving ) she had her hands on my knee and was kinda close, and to be honest I got really horny and I wanted to leave immediately out of reflex I stood up I said sorry but it just came to my mind that I have to leave I still need to do some errands for my mother I’m really sorry can u tell “name of the daughter” that I will come back later when she is back? Thanks! And I was turning around thinking about god damn that shit was close my dick is rock hard i have to go home ASAP and jerk off. But she didn’t let me she said “wait hold on „name of the daughter” will be back in a moment just sit here I call her if u want” so I felt kinda bad and was sitting there again and I felt more and more horny and I enjoyed it when she came closer... so at some point I looked her straight in the eyes and I just think she knew exactly what I was thinking we starred deeply into our eyes and we kissed, at first I was thinking “are u stupid u love her daughter so much and u do this?! You are the worst better go home and fucking kill yourself u don’t deserve anything ugly bastard” so I stopped for a short moment and she grabbed for my dick and just in that second every thought in my mind vanished and I was just thinking about Sex, having my first time with a really pretty women, not being a virgin anymore and know how it feels to be one with a women. 


My girlfriend came back one or two hours when we were finished, it seems like she had a important Termin or something like that and I’ve just misheard errands... when I looked at her I felt so bad I swear I could throw up I was pale and just speechless, I told her it’s pretty late and i better go home, during my walk I’ve tried to jump infront of a car multiple times but I was too scared... 

I had this relationship with her mum for a whole year, everytime I felt so extremely bad but I just couldn’t stop i never had sex with my girlfriend bcs she didn’t feel the need for it at all but I was an extremely horny person and when I saw her mum I just couldn’t keep it back... at some point I had sex with her and I’ve never in my life felt something so good it was probably because I loved her so extremely much, at that time my heart just couldn’t keep up and it broke... I’ve cried and told her everything... she was sitting there for half an hour or so she didn’t say anything and she didn’t looked at me. To be honest I wanted to die so badly soo extremely badly but I thought if I just kill myself that wouldn’t be fair  because she has to live with it and I just can’t escape my problems by doing that... So i was just sitting there and i was scared not of her reaction but more that she will harm herself. 

After those 30minutes she stood up put her clothes on went to her mum and was asking if that was true, her mum was shocked for a moment looked down and said “yes” but it was such a quiet tone u could really hear how scared she was to admit something like that. Her daughter just looked at her for a second and left, me and her mum looked for her the whole day but couldn’t find her. Luckily she came back one day later, her mum told me to not come back anymore, the girl didn’t talked for me for about half a year... I don’t know if it were her feelings for me or because we share the same friends but after that half a year I came back in contact with her, right now we are just really close friends but sometimes we go beyond that friend line (not in a sexual way) but she is the one who is always stopping it what I can indeed understand... I really can’t forgive myself and I still feel so extremely sorry, this post is just a way to kind of let out my frustration even though I probably know most of you guys will hate me so much bcs I hurt such a nice girl... 


And again I apology to her maybe she is seeing this post or maybe not but I do hope nobody of you will ever do something like this in his life, it’s extremely heart breaking and normally I’m a really cold person.",15Apr2019,0

I am sorry if I misspell something in advance! 

So basically what I am doing right now is a internship in a country far away from my home country... And i met a girl at work i don’t know how I should put it but I think I quite like her we’ve been traveling and we are going out quite often since (1Month). She will be going back to her hometown in 2 Months (And doing her Master).what I know is that her ex BF died a approx a year ago... and as far as I know she said she likes someone else... but she is also (maybe my interpretation is bad) saying things like why can’t u (I) be more romantic or its been a long time that I was so happy. These signs confuses me a lot and I am not sure what I should do... Because at first I was trying to push her away but now I am not sure what to do or will it even work out on this huge distance. I kind of don’t want to lose her because of my overthinking, but not doing anything kills me to.

70,"i dont even know if gross correctly describes it. i really really wanted to ask my best friend to prom, just as friends, and i had a fucking fantastic poster planned and everything. i wanted to keep it a surprise for her, but i wanted to avoid any awkward “thanks, but i can’t because...” confrontations, so i emailed her mom to clear it. she said no, citing that the mom and dad had planned a getaway that weekend not knowing it was prom, and my friend and her siblings already had plans for that night, implying they weren’t to be changed. which i thought was fine, whatever. i was sad but hey, they already had plans. then i got an email from the mom this morning saying that oops, sorry, turns out plans could have been changed because someone else asked my friend to prom as a friend and she said yes and the siblings changed their plans accordingly. i know that hey, it’s just prom, whoop de doo who cares, but it would’ve meant so much to me to go to prom with my best friend, for more reasons than i can go into now, and now i feel like if i ask to join the group i’d be intruding. god, idk what to do because now i don’t think i have anyone to go to prom with, and i know it’s not much but god i just want to crumple and cry. prom means so much more to me than just a stupid dance, it’s me finally being okay with myself and making my family see that i can be great even without a boyfriend or the “perfect” body or skin. and now, i can’t do that. every other friend that i have already has a significant other to go with or goes to another school, so i feel like it’s either go alone or not at all.

75,"Quick disclaimer:  I am trying be as objective as possible about myself, and nothing below is said to be arrogant or prideful.  I know better than anyone of my imperfection.  I cut down a lot of what I wrote, bu if you don’t want to read the novel you can skip to the last paragraph.



For some background, I (21M) have always been told I was mature for my age.  I do believe I have a very level head in most situations.  I also know that I’m fairly emotionally intelligent as well.  I do not know exactly what factors were nature vs. nurture, but the most influential internal factors are the base processes of my brain.  To me it’s logical to assume everyone’s  “cerebral algorithms” are nuanced.  I would also infer that due to being biochemical in function, these algorithms can and will be changed, either intentionally or not.  That being said, I do believe certain core characteristics of these algorithms cannot be removed or altered intentionally without the use of any external tools.  I see the my most pertinent core characteristics as relating to information, emotion, and relative morality.  

     First, I have always been majorly analytical.  I think very deeply about a lot all the time.  Deep analysis mixed with a pretty good memory for info means I can make a lot of insights very quickly.  This analytical perspective has enabled me to self-evaluate and scrutinize my beliefs almost constantly.  I wholeheartedly believe that no one will ever be able to question my thinking deeper than I do each day.  This makes me pretty effective at understanding the nuance and sensitivity of logic and reason.  

     I have always felt emotion very deeply, which  allows me to empathize very easily with others.  This depth of emotion and empathic sensation provides a general feeling of love towards everyone while also letting me gain insight into a person’s emotional perspective.  The combination of emotional intelligence and deep analysis has made me better at being open-minded but rational.  

     Finally, my childhood obviously was very formative, but the context of my family was the final determining factor in my personality.  My relationship with my oldest brother and my mom has the most profound impact on my moral compass.  Butting heads with my brother is what solidified my distaste for unjust authority, arbitrary rules, and faulty logic.  I was lucky to also be heavily influenced by my mom.  All my family members are very solid Christians, but my mom most of all.  From her I learned to give grace always, to love generously, and to be at peace as far as it concerns me.   These lessons gave me a very important perspective on morality and truth.  The degree to which one can be certain about any truth or moral code is determined by it’s relativity.  Not only must the “truth” interact with others, but the subjective and objective information must also interact internally.  My view of truth and morality as relative increased my acceptance of the personal truths held by individuals.

     My purpose for providing so much background was to communicate some of the definitive aspects of my personality.  I’ve made a lot of progress as a human being  via all manner of lessons.  I’m not a perfect human being, but I’m gonna keep moving forward.  Something others would say about me is that I am kind and understanding.  I have become skilled at identifying the existence and depth of the wound(s) that result in worse mental health.  Similarly, I have gotten very good at understanding flaws in the perspectives of others and my own.  I prefer to let others progress organically.  I only suggest changing perspectives to those whose support system I am a part of, and even then I wait until the behavior in question has become a pattern indicative of deeper issues.  The reason I feel arrogant is because over this past year I have gained more insight while it seems like the vast majority of my peers rarely see needs for improvement, and when they do improve it is usually minimal due to a lack of in-depth analysis.  When I feel that way I have to remind myself not to judge where someone is on their path.  Seeing those with a lack of perspective makes me sad more than anything.  My best friend is a different situation.  In the 2 years I’ve know him (let’s call him Jay), he has become my closest friend.  I want him to have happiness and good health, and part of that is being aware of his mental health (same as he is with me).  The pain Jay has experienced in his life has left him wanting in the communication department.  He is very quick to speak, often interrupting with a response before you even make your point.  He assumes he knows what you are saying and is a very loud person, meaning it’s very hard to get a word in.  With certain conversations and topics, I couldn’t give a shit, but when HE comes to me with deep, serious topics or questions I do my best to force him to stay quiet and listen when I am talking.  I have a very similar personality trait in that I was terrible at interrupting when I was younger.  When I got super excited about a topic I had a much harder time waiting for a turn to speak.  I still have issues from time to time, but I interrupt far less now and I am better at ensuring any individuals I do interrupt that I did not mean to make them feel stupid or belittled.  A lot of lessons took me years to learn because I was learning them during adolescence and I needed the right perspective to enable quicker progress.  As a 21 year old man, I am well past the point where I need time to make a change.  Obviously time is necessary to get better at the good behavior while getting rid of the bad.  The time I’m talking about is the time it takes to realize one must make a change.  As an adult, I believe we should be improving our perspective daily primarily through our own introspection.  That being said, if someone close to me asks me to change my behavior, I will seriously consider that request and will always accept at least part of the suggestion with almost 0 questions.  This is because those in my support system know that accountability is sometimes necessary, and if the issue is being brought up it’s because it became a pattern and I did not recognize it.  

     So my breaking point was last night.  Jay and I were talking and the conversation got really deep and insightful.  A girl he’s talking to was there as well.  Both the girl (call her kate) and Jay complimented my communication then Jay asked how it’s as good as it is.  I started off by sharing some big talking points that I hoped would stick if anything did.  The first point was to be quick to listen and slow to speak.  The second was to give grace at all times and to never place assumptions on a conversation.  I emphasized that this means choosing not to be offended by another person’s word choice (don’t assume intent, give grace) as well as being aware of one’s own word choice and it’s effect on others.  The last point was to take the log out of your own eye before getting the speck out of theirs.  The idea is that we can always look for ways to improve our communication no matter what anyone else does.  I shared these things first because Jay struggles with all of those things specifically and they really hurt his communication.  After I got through those points I couldn’t get in another two sentences before jay or Kate would make a comment towards the other without caring about word choice, then the other would get offended by their word choice.  Moreover, it seemed they were physically incapable of listening to anything for more than 5 seconds before they had to speak.  The moment an accusation was made it was responded to by an accusation the other way, as if bad behavior from one justified that from the other.  What really made me crazy was the fact that they both expressed a desire to know my answer specifically, and both are smart ADULTS who are definitely capable trying to be intentional about communicating or at the VERY least can learn some sort of lesson.  I was so confused how they could both be so entrenched in their ways.  Not even a crash course in good communication IMMEDIATELY followed by an interactive demo made a dent.  Additionally, the communication mistakes made in the “demo” were only those that I had talked about, as if they were mocking me.  This is the level of maturity 80% of my surrounding peers consistently fit under.  I get discouraged when people don’t have the right perspective to motivate any progress.  Is it arrogant of me to see this as the final indication I needed to determine I was more mature than my friends?  It was like a punch in the face that people don’t understand how deep things really go, which ends up making them even less likely to admit they are mistaken and change.  Idk if anyone will read this, I just needed to vent.",15Apr2019,1

78,"I'm 23 right now and I met my ex in my first semester of college I was 18 and he was 20. We met and we instantly connected and we debated for over 2 hours about different world topics. Not only was he gorgeous, but he was one of the smartest people I ever met. I told all of my friends that I want to marry a man just like him. We stayed acquaintances for the next 3 years because we were both in relationships. I knew I could never be with him because he wasn't from my religion/culture. However, in those 3 years he always was trying to learn more about my culture and religion and always asked me questions. This was my last semester of college and I had invited him to come to the gala that I was hosting. I sat with him and a bunch of other current/former students in our club office and I told him that I always had a crush on him (casually in front of 10 other people) and he turned bright red and immediately said he had a crush on me too. I was surprised because ALL of the girls crushed on him (6 ft, dimples, cute smile, great bone structure, so sweet, innocent and beautiful curls). He asked me out on a date a week later and I told him no we could never work out because me dating someone outside of my culture/religion is forbidden. He kept pursuing me for a few months and convinced me to give him a chance. We fell madly in love and became the best of friends, but my relationship had to remain a secret from my parents. He ended up falling in love with my religion and converted on his own and became a member of my community. He became a counselor at my place of worship, a mentor for kids who were struggling with the religion, learned my language, and read like 20 books about my culture and the history if my people. He really went above and beyond. After every date he'd draw me a doodle of us and what happened in that date. He'd constantly write me love letters and give me paintings. He didn't have much financially, but he always showed me he loved me. I have a book with everything he's made me and called it our love story. After a year and a half of us dating my parents found out. They gave me two choices marry him that week and be disowned (I'm SUPER close with my family they're amazing and have given me everything and more) or breakup with him. At first I thought the choice was easy...just marry him. However, the both of us were not financially independent (I was a grad student he's working part time). It was the HARDEST choice I had to make and I chose my family. A month later I bump into him in the library and he was a mess and I was miserable. We began to be on and off for 2 months because we were both scared of the consequences of us getting back together (forbidden love). We than got back together and fell in love all over again. In total we've been together in secrecy for 3 years. His whole family loves me and my cousins and friends love him (only my immediate family doesn't know). However, in the last few months I have been pushing him to get his life more in order. He did move out and did get a full time job, but he's making less than 30k as an assistant teacher. His life goal is to give back and does not care about money. All he cares about is improving the lives of people without a voice (he spends like 20 hrs a week canvassing asking people if they have any tenant issues and than he gathers other community members to fix the problem...for free) (also has a few special needs friends and always picks them up and takes them out) (did I mention he's completely selfless) (he never watches tv and is just constantly reading). He is one of the best people I know and is crazy smart and puts strangers needs before his own. We broke up 2 months  ago because I kept mothering him to find a goal or have more ambition and he hated that (I come from a very affluent family and will have my Masters in 3 weeks). Also I knew I couldn't give up my family. Writing this all down I feel like a total dumb ass for us breaking up...we spent 5 hours in his room crying together saying how much we love each other and how this isn't fair. It was a very mature and loving breakup...I know we still love each other. 

If you were me would you give it another shot even though nothing has changed. Than I'd have to give up my family (be disowned) and be okay with really struggling.",15Apr2019,1

I was hanging out after school, waiting for a friend to leave with when a passing girl looked at my stomach.

""Umm, are you pregnant?"" She asked softly. I doubt it was a question of genuine concern, more of just being nosy with her friend. But at least she didn't draw attention to us.

""No,"" I scoffed, and immediately pulled in my stomach. 

""Oh, sorry."" I never saw her again.

If I let my belly go, I actually did look quite pregnant. I hadnt thought anything of it until then when I looked in the mirror. 

It took several days of ""training"" myself to contract my ab muscles to get used to having my stomach pulled in (imagine a prepubescent teen girl looking like bodybuilder era Schwarzenegger walking with a puffed up chest), but it took years to make myself look natural doing it. It doesn't even bother me. Holding in my stomach is as natural as blinking for me. People never believed me when I told them I held my stomach in.

Now, if I let my stomach go, its super uncomfortable. My internal organs have gotten so used to being held up a certain way that if I let my stomach go, it becomes hard to breathe due to my diaphragm being pulled down. I can only do it when I'm sitting down.

Initially, I have an emotional response similar to when I see people wearing drastically mismatched items of clothing (think brogues and sweat pants).

But then there’s something much deeper than that. 

Generally I like it when traditions are updated and fashion moves on. A lot of modern architecture feels oppressive and imposing though, and I know I’m supposed to see beauty and innovation, but I see none of that.

All I see is an act of violence against the beauty and harmony of our shared spaces, and for what? To save money? 

There’s something organic and pleasing about classical architecture. It almost feels natural, like it compliments the nature it’s replaced, it honours that which it destroyed.

I’m only 20 but I would love to live on my own and start to get a taste of the adult world. I want to be able to spread my wings and live a little. I don’t know where to start though and what to do. I have some money saved up but not enough to buy a house yet. I could probably rent but my parents think that will be a waste of money. ( they would prefer if I just saved up and ended up buying a house) I don’t know what the better option is. I just need some opinions. Is there anyone else who feels or has felt the way I do? I feel stuck.",15Apr2019,2
95,"I am currently a college student and I created a new website in order to help college students use unorthodox ways to make money. These ideas are stuff either I have personally done or I've seen done around my campus.  I have no clue where to start promoting my new website. I've read plenty of articles online but they don't really seem to help. I was wondering if anyone else would have a good suggestion.

96,"I received a message from the pokemonribbons subreddit saying that I am banned from posting there (although I didn't post anything that would result in a ban and all my posts are not harassment or anything). Although I haven't actually made a new post there since getting the ban notification, whenever I try to make a new topic or post the options aren't grayed out and it allows me to comment. So I'm not sure if they might've banned me and then later on lifted the ban, likely realized that they got the wrong user by mistake or if I'm supposed to get banned from another subreddit (I have been shitposting a small bit on [r/nintendoswitch](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendoswitch) lately) and somehow got banned on the wrong subreddit or what.

98,"I often find myself watching these movies that have the themes of friendship great bonds sometimes romance. I'm talking about the old school Stand By Me or the new school Paper Towns and I see these characters just gave amazing convos and experiences with one another and just wish that could be me and my friends. 

My highschool friend and I used to have that but theres a girl that got between us and frankly I hate that we arent friends anymore. It's a long confusing story but this was my friendship that put on a Corey Matthews and Shawn Hunter (Boy Meets World) level! 

That is what I want again but just extremely hard to get there. IDK I'm not 30 have a wife no kids and I do have a good set of friends but no one that close. What do people do these days to meet people?",15Apr2019,1
99,"Ok, I know that title was worded in a confusing way, but I'm not sure how else to put it. 

Say you're in an argument with someone and they devolve into assuming something horrible about you (e.g. ""I bet you're the type to _____ regularly"" or ""Lol you're probably just a __________, pathetic"" etc). 

This generally happens when the argument goes in circles and they're providing no actual substance to any of it, just trying to be as apathetic and insulting as possible. 

My theory about this is that it means that they literally can't find any legitimate criticism against you as a person (and using ad hominems is their only debate tactic), which would logically mean that you're actually an awesome person since they have no real opinion to offer. 

Do you guys think that makes sense? I'm trying to understand how people could act like this and not see the absurdity in it, there has to be some sort of deep insecurity underlying it, yeah?",15Apr2019,1
100,"I am currently wondering which will come first: me killing myself or me quitting my job.  Please don't freak out on me about the first thing.  I'm just laugh crying right now sitting in my cubicle thinking about moving into the hills and becoming a hermit in the hopes that wolves will tear me to pieces and have me for dinner.  I often wonder what my coworkers think of me asking god to kill me and moaning so frequently.  I am sorry to them if it makes them uncomfortable.  The funny thing is that it doesn't matter what I do or where I go I will always have the stinging pain of failure looming over me and beating me savagely into the ground until I'm flat as a pancake, stabbing me repeatedly in the heart.  I often wonder if my purpose in life is to be like a gag reel for god, someone who so frequently fails in order for god and his buddies to have a good laugh.  I'd like to think if I wasn't good at anything else, well at least I was good for that.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I'm not going to kill myself today so no need to try to talk me out of anything.  I just can't do that to my mom (and before you say anything, I know I know I'm supposed to stay alive for myself but that line of thinking ain't gonna keep me here).  I know I'm a sad sack, I know I need to just pull myself up by my bootstraps and get my shit together.  Well on paper my life actually looks good and I'd say I've been working very hard at life over the last 14 months.  There's something about life that just doesn't work for me, no matter how much ""success"" I have, or how much ""spirituality"" or ""perspective"" I gain.  Apparently taking a fistful of anti-depressants every morning and going to therapy doesn't do it either.  That's ok, I'm a sad, angry guy and that's what I'm meant to be.  I'll keep on doing this thing until I can't do it anymore and I'll laugh at myself along the way.  I just know that the universe is sending me signs right now and they are telling me ""Go, go, go.  What you are doing right now is the wrong thing."".  Maybe it's time I listened.",15Apr2019,2

102,"I recently (about two weeks ago) decided to stop sleeping around. I have had roughly 40-45 partners within the past 5.5 months.

I decided to stop because of two reasons: one, I started thinking about my first one night stand. We had great chemistry and he was super interesting to talk to. I think about him all the time now (not necessarily in a sexual way). I figured that was my minds way of telling me that I'm tired of the casual sex. Secondly, I am tired of just being used for my body and not being appreciated for everything else that I have to offer.

However, my ""vow"" lasted about 6 days until I caved and slept with my fwb. I am feeling unmotivated, sort of lonely and have an urge to text him again, even though every time I see him I say it's my last. I have also definitely not had enough social interaction today to have a ""good"" day and distract myself from my anxiety.",15Apr2019,1

I just feel like we have imprisoned ourselves with this lifestyle. Maybe if we all just lived in the forest as hunter-gatherers, life would feel more fulfilling.",15Apr2019,1

105,"I recently wrote this to my siblings.

Our conversation, for most of our lives, was based on a vulnerable self examimation which resulted in an unusual intimacy. It was a beautiful thing; our willingness to look hard into our capacity and challenges to love and be loved. Only since I have spoken about the problems with the official 9/11 narrative has our conversation broken down. Neither of us should take it personally because millions of people around the world are having a very difficult time having a productive conversation about the topic. It was similar about the Civil War and Vietnam War in particular: familes were torn apart because of an inability to contructively communicate what mattered so deeply to them. Emotion rules, as it tragically tends to do, when things really matter to us. 

I broached this conversation back in 2005 as I was researching for the first time questions which would challenge the foundations of how I see the world. Those challenges have only deepened over the years since. I have presented science, not conspiracy theories or conjecture, as a basis for communication about the impossibility of the official narrative of how those three towers came down. It is absolutely kafkaesque to me that so relatively few people are capable of setting aside prejudices and simply examining the data divorced from emotion. It can be tremendously difficult to examine the obvious when the results of doing so may turn your world view on its head. I have studied human psychology to gain a deeper understanding of why good, intelligent people so vehemently refuse to enter this conversation. There are numerous reasons, and I have had to adjust my estimation of intelligence, “good”, moral, ethical, and spiritual capacities. Many very intelligent people cannot enter an open conversation about the 9/11 data. Many “average intelligence” people can’t either. So the ability to engage in this conversation with an open mind is only to a degree a function of intelligence. It is more a function of openness, curiosity, and humility.
When I heard the data that those buildings came down AT (in the case of WTC 7 for over 100 feet) or close to freefall accelleration, it got my attention, not because I’m the smartest guy in the room (I’m not) but because I understand both experientially and conceptually how shit falls. Climb a tree; slip and fall. Hit branches, slow down. Climb a flagpole the same height, let go, hit the ground far faster and harder. The concept is simple even for a five year old: it is not a function of high or low intelligence. 

Why do I care?

I was horrified and traumatized along with the rest of us watching thousands die that day. It remains a height of horror in my entire life. I was furious at the terrorists for the barbarity and as ready as anybody to bomb Iraq or Afghanistan into the stone age. Desert Storm 2 didn’t worry me much. They made their bed, here’s what it feels like to lie in it. I was like most other people. But along came some new data, and it was huge. Couldn’t ignore it it; grabbed me by the throat. The implications were so overwhelming that I was both enthralled and horrified. Now I’m more horrified by human individual and social nature; how we collectively can be made to believe absurdities and then in the name of them commit atrocities. It is absurd to believe that a skyscraper can come down at or anywhere close to freefall accelleration without the lower part of the building being removed. 

So now i have my more meaningful conversations with people who have addressed the absurdity and dealt with it the best they can. I don’t have to bite my tongue when the conversation moves into politics; everyone I have more than casual conversation with knows the political scene is more corrupt than we can fathom.  

I’m not interested in censoring myself.

You have pretty much treated me like I’m deranged for caring so much about what I see as the deception of the century, resulting in unfathomable death and suffering, and for being horrified that so many smart good people don’t care.  No fucking way my family! You’re all strong enough to look this thing in the eye soberly and confront the data and the implications, because I’m not going through the rest of my life pretenting that it’s not there. Call me crazy; I believe in the power of data evidence. If you want to claim it’s not data you can to the cows come home, but I’ll interact with you like you’re imbedded in the Matrix. And no, we can’t just pretend like this doesn’t exist and talk about everything else becuase a whole lot of everything else is connected to the deception remaining in place and I won’t be party to it. Fuck ignorance. Fuck fear. Fuck social acceptance. When being socially acceptable means acceding to absurdities and lies I’ll take not being accepted by those who can’t or won’t even attempt a rational conversation.

This is the elephant in the room.
