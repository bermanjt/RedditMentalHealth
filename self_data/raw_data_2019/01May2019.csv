1,"I’m a relatively young male, and I masturbate. I don’t think it’s anything to be ashamed of but my family is Christian and my mother is against such a thing. They aren’t aggressively Christian or anything but i still feel like I should keep it a secret from her. But I feel guilty for keeping it a secret (I know this sounds weird). I know she wouldn’t hate me or anything for doing it but I don’t want to risk ruining our relationship or having her feel as if she can’t trust me. What should I do? Just pull her aside and tell her hoping she understands, or keep it to myself because it’s a personal thing?",01May2019,1
2,"So this is sort of a stupid post but it's really heavy on my mind but it's also  insensitive so I can't really share it with anyone irl. 

Pretty much all of the deaths that have impacted me have happened in May. My paternal grandfather died in May before I was born, my paternal grandmother died in May when I was 17, and now my maternal grandmother has suffered a stroke and is in extremely poor condition and the doctors don't seem to have too much hope for her and tomorrow is May 1st. Last year on May 15th my cousin was killed in a bad thunderstorm - a tree fell on his car crushing him on his way to work. He was only 31 and his wife, who he had been with for 9 years at that point, was 5 months pregnant. This is the even that has shaken me the most in my entire life. It was beyond unexpected and tragic and has really impacted the way I view life. We weren't close, but there is not a day that goes by that I don't think about him. Also, last year on May 12th my boyfriend's good friend was hit and killed while riding his bike. He was also in his early thirties and while I didn't know him, his death has shaken me and really changed my boyfriend. And this seems silly in comparison but my childhood pets, my cat Daisy and dog Buddha, both died in May on memorial day weekend one year apart. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also my birthday is May 12. Does anyone out there think this means something or is this one of life's big coincidences? I feel so superstitious and now May seems so ominous. I don't know what the point of this is, I'm just sad about everything and trying to make sense of it.",01May2019,3

I've decided to blow them off by not answering. If someone wants to speak to me, they can leave a message or text--but they never do.

I also use a Google feature called ""Screen call"" where Google answers initially and tells them to state their business before they connect them to me--Google Voice has this functionality. People never even do that, and I'm literally sitting on the other end of the line waiting for them to respond. Eventually, the call ends, and I feel better.",01May2019,1

12,"I have been noticing a pattern since past few days and as I try to recall my dreams, I always feel something missing but only until recently, I realized I cannot see colors at all in my dreams. It’s just the grey, black and white movie that plays. It is bothering me now so much as to how has this been going on for more than 20 years. 
Also, in my waking life, I’ve realized that whenever I go for cosmetic shopping or something, I never understand the spectrum of colors and out of the fear of picking the wrong ones, I always always end up picking the black ones. I also thought I’ve two sweaters of the Same color but my friend pointed out that one is blue and the other one is purple. I still cannot differentiate. I still don’t understand what color is my hair, sometimes I think it’s brown, sometimes I think it’s black and sometimes I was close to believing it’s ivory.

13,"I was born in NY, in Feb 3rd 1989.

First of all, i never knew my father. I had a step dad, he was an alcoholic irresponsible person and lazy as hell but he never mistreat me anyway. I tried to reach to my bio father but he told me he doesnt want to and he died few years after that. 

I have an elder brother and a younger brother which has autism and they are from another men also.

My childhood was a nightmare. I get beaten by mom, heared so many insults from her and never get any approval for anything in my life. She beaten me with a chair leg and forced to kiss her feet, hit me through window and nearly dead between glasses, insults everyday, bring me and my younger brother alone in home has no electricity or water for two weeks and came back like it never happened when i was 13 and my younger was 7. I was once beaten while sleeping because of why im not sleeping. i was already sleeping but she was too drunk to notice that.

I was accepted by a private school for above avarage capacity children with full scholarship when i was 10 but she didnt accept that because im an idiot and their test results are wrong.

My elder was abused  me once when i was 9. 

I was accepted from a university but she didnt send me because we broke.

We changed 14 houses.

I changed 12 schools.

Never had long term friendship except one.

Never wear a new thing until 21. She always wear new things anyway.

She is 62 years old now and tells everyone how a good mother she is, and i hate her.

She is responsible of my failure.

She is responsible of my lack of self confidence.

She is responsible of my past and future.

And i want to yell these to her face, but...

Im still a good guy anyway. This is not me.

14,"i’ve been single for two and a half years, and in love with a close friend of mine for the majority of that time. we talk every day but we rarely see each other, and today he finally was able to carve out some time from his swamped schedule so we could hang out and just catch up for a bit, and we talked about so much more than i had expected, and it was so comforting to know for sure what i mean to him and what i’ve helped him with and i want him to be happy and healthy and balanced and i’m so glad he’s finally taking steps to get there and skxjksdj i still love him so much, but something about our conversation finally put me at peace with my feelings for him, like i finally feel like i don’t need to be pining so hard after him like i have been, like i can just relax and trust that he cares about me the way that he’s always proven to and that that, in the end, is the most important thing to me. it’s a great feeling when i’ve been hurting for him for so long. but i’m so tired and sad about being single. i’m so done with it. i hate online dating, i gave that up officially a few months ago but i still sometimes feel drawn to trying it again even though it never pans out and only wastes my time and energy. i miss having someone who’s consistently looking forward to seeing me, who puts time aside specifically for me, who doesn’t make me feel anxious or make me question my decision when i talk to them about something i’m dealing with. my ex has started seeing someone new. it shouldn’t hurt because it’s been so long and because i don’t feel anything romantic towards them anymore. but it hurts anyway. idk. i had a good day today. but now i’m just feeling down. guess i’ll just go back to listening to post malone and drowning out the sadness?",01May2019,3
15,"Sounds pathetic I know lol. But this job was so great. I have anxiety and the job was literally a strict routine where I would go in and do the same thing everyday. Almost no surprises. I'd write the same things and go the same places and I was so content. 

That same job got outsourced to another company so I applied to the company the job is now at and got an interview but wasn't accepted. I was so shaken up cause I thought the interview went well and I did my job fairly well when I had it but...

Since then the job has been advertised once more and I emailed the HR manager and she said they already chose somebody. I was so :((( 

I read online that it's good to keep up with companies you applied to and didn't get through to so I was wondering if I should send another email cause it's been a few months, or if that would be too annoying and desperate.

I tried applying there since I was 18, and never got a response. No worries, I was always able to find a job elsewhere that could pay the bills. But recently, I had a financial crisis and I saw myself fighting to not drown in debt... And I got that fateful call. The Cheesecake Factory. They wanted to interview me.

Not to sound corny or anything, but I felt saved by them. I could see the light, the metaphorical noose around my neck loosening.

The whole experience has been so exhilarating so far! Just the training alone is showing me what a great company it is. 

My family probably won't like hearing about how much I really enjoy the job because they assume I'm just using this job to pay my bills and get through school. I mean, I AM using it for that, but it's not going to be a job that I only go for temporarily-- I want this to be my career. And boy, I'm going to get a lot of hate for going after a career that requires a lot of manual labor versus the career I'm going to school for that boasts having a 6-figure salary, but I've always loved serving. I really, really do. And now that I got a fantastic job at The Cheesecake Factory, I don't want to let that go.

26,"I am literally no better than the next psychotic ape roaming this Earth. The things we use to check ourselves. Our ""morals"" and the things that make us angry and the moments that lead to war. I mean..... there are no actual monsters.

&amp;#x200B;

Only us.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this. Everything good or bad in this world. JUST EVERYTHING. There is only us. WE ARE DOING THIS TO OURSELVES. ALL OF IT. 

&amp;#x200B;

ALL. OF. IT.

&amp;#x200B;

There are alot of things I just can not deal with or abide by. Just like anyone else. What I have realized is that my response to those things, the things I can not bear to think about on a regular basis, is often harsher and more extreme than the original issue at hand. And I'm constantly hypocritical. CONSTANTLY. I imagine most people are whether they realize it or not. Being human means multiplicity. We can not function otherwise. Being human is fucking complicated. It's just a never ending maze of complexity and hypocrisy. THE MAZE. We will never escape it and we are constantly pursued by the Minotaur that is actually a culmination of our collective guilt. 

&amp;#x200B;

The best thing about us is the stupid and silly shit we get ourselves into. The worst things...... are too awful to mention. We pull some reprehensible shit when we think we will get away with it. Yet no matter what we do or who we are, there is always this grey area. Like a sand-box safe-zone we have made for ourselves. Hidden between our many realities. A place where you don't ask questions and don't assume. A place we all work and exist quietly in tandem. 

&amp;#x200B;

As if the bad will go away if we just fucking ignore it.

&amp;#x200B;

Humanity is experiencing a leap right now. It's hard to see but we are smack dab in the middle of an evolutionary leap. Our brains are changing, our genes are changing and we are already making our own adjustments. Society is changing, war is changing, our notions of what is acceptable are changing. Money and finance is changing and our laws are following suit. Everything is changing. EVERYTHING. 

&amp;#x200B;

Life is nothing but constant change. People absolutely can and do change. Our survival depends on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Most people do not handle change very well. Including myself. It's scary and threatening. Every unknown becomes an abyss. The problem with this and us? What we do now defines the future.  Fear is the mind killer. (F.H. Dune)

29,"I'm not exactly what you'd call the sharpest tool in the shed. I've never really excelled at anything I've tried, but managed to scrape through hanging by my fingernails. Though I posture and say big words, the truth is that the stink of ""mediocre-to-weak"" follows me wherever I go.

Mediocre-to-weak work.

Mediocre-to-weak jokes.

Mediocre-to-weak emotional strength. 

Mediocre-to-weak planning skills.

Mediocre-to-weak marks.

Mediocre-to-weak effort.

Mediocre-to-weak stories.

I've wallowed in this grey muck for so long, desperate to be free. But somehow I either never manage to put enough effort to show real improvement, or completely forget about trying in the first place.

The hallway of my life is filled with amateur half done paintings, crumpled planners, bare passes, rejection letters, unreturned calls, half opened envelopes, and the ghosts of a thousand missed opportunities.

I'm not oblivious to this either, the painful feeling of life slipping through my fingers bores into my brain like a drill every day.

With that, comes the shame. The absolutely devouring sense that your entire life is built on ""could have been""s. My mind is sent reeling, and I often curl up into a ball and cry myself to sleep.

And so my brain tries to compensate. It knows it can't really put in the effort to be as good as it wants to be, so it pretends. I find myself telling wild untrue stories about my accomplishments, who I am, what I know, and other insignificant things in a pitiful way to make me seem like I'm more important than I really am. While talking to a friend, I'll realize I've been talking about how I managed to land an interview at this incredible job with crazy benefits and fantastic work, while in reality I've yet to receive any response to my résumés. And every time I do it, I dig myself deeper into a hole with no choice but to keep going. So I do until people realize I've been feeding them nonsense for the longest time. And so they just smile and nod while I tell fantastical stories, entertaining this poor, insecure child.

So I keep up the farce. Going and going and going. Like a mouse hopelessly trying to be a bear.

After some time, I'll push these thoughts to the back of my mind. Given some more and I'll start smiling a bit again. But whenever a crisis occurs, or something important needs to happen, I'll be pushed out and left without duty, or an inkling of responsibility. An even worse situation is when there's no choice but to put me in charge. People around me get nervous and second guess me, knowing full well that they could do a better job than I can. And that feeling is crushing. After the smoke clears and the damage is assessed, I'm handed the real life equivalent of a participation trophy; a pat on the back and someone saying ""you did the best you could"" while walking out the door.

I don't even know how to end this. I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. If anyone has read to this point, I really appreciate your kindness. It isn't easy to read the ramblings of a confused and crumbling man. I guess I'll be going now.",01May2019,4
30,"Everyone keeps saying that talking about it will help, so I just thought I’d write it down. 

I’m still in shock, drained and can’t really think straight so my writing might suck.. but I need to just get this all out so I can try to sleep. 

I was in the middle of senior seminar, about to present a research proposal for my final project for graduation. I was supposed to be the last one to present, but before I had a chance to go up, we heard someone shout “SHOOTER!” just  down the hall. I wish I knew who shouted that warning because they may have saved the lives of everyone in my class. 

We locked the door, barricaded it with chairs and 14 of us huddled in balls on the floor behind a big wooden table. Gunshots... I didn’t really process it very well... it didn’t seem real. We had about 5 different people on the line with the police and campus sent out a message that read: “Shots reported: Run, Hide, Fight. Secure yourself immediately” 

Gunshots... As I sat there with my head tucked between my arms all I could think was “I could die today.” I started mentally preparing myself for the worst.. started gauging how bad it might hurt if I were to be shot in the head. 

Then there was silence. The longest silence of my life. No notice from authorities if the guy had been caught, no knowledge of this guys whereabouts or whether or not there were more than one. 

Started hearing boots outside our door.. could be the shooter, could be the police. Then we heard a loud *thud* against the wall down by the woman’s bathroom in Denny - presumably the police catching the guy, but I don’t really know the details, I’m just trying to put the pieces together. 

We heard police going from door to door yelling “clear!” But we weren’t evacuated for another 45 minutes. 

6 shot: 2 dead, 4 wounded. Less than 100 yards away from me. 

I can’t think straight. Yeah I’m alive and I should be grateful, but my biggest fear- getting shot in the fucking head- was someone’s reality today and there are 2 families that lost a child tonight so I can’t really be happy about it. 

I don’t even know what else to say right now. All I can hear are gunshots and helicopters.",01May2019,6
31,"You're reading this? I apologize, these are my thoughts and they might be all over the place. I'm a single mom, 2 babies, beautiful babies, well behaved, loving, wonderful children. My ex and I, we get along-- we co-parent very effectively. Life alone is happy, clean, organized. Why do I have the urge to welcome someone into my bubble? 

For 16 years I wasn't single for longer than a few weeks, maybe a couple months tops (sorry it's how I was, I literally try to make relationships work for so long by the time it's over it's OOOOVER) This is comprised of a 5 year relationship, 2-2 year relationships, and a 7 year relationship. But I know I am happy alone, happy with myself. Even while having some serious mental issues I am actually happy and I even get help for the anxiety and depression frequently which wasn't how I dealt with things in the past. 

I am at the peak of my life, even with my ex having cancer, even with my best friend dying right in front of my eyes, even with the man I was dedicated to for 7 years and the father of my children cheating on me, even with the stress that comes along with 2 small children who are bright and challenging. I feel under control. I have never been able to say that before in life.

So why do I just dislike most people? I'm not mean about it, I do pride myself on being a kind person, or at the very least trying to be the best me I can be. Like don't get me wrong my ex, even having cheated on me, he's still cool as a friend and I'd still leap mountains for him just I'd never get on that D ever again. My family, they're okay-ish about 80% of them at least. The people I work with are also very enjoyable people. 

But I mean, I've been dating since around October ish and maybe I should use the term dating loosely because I want to say it's more like, I've been forced to suffer the torture that is the illiterate 25-40 year old male. Only 7.5 of them have made it to the first date in that time (I'll explain the math later), and only 3 of those made it to the 2nd date, and one of them almost made it to a third date. It feels like ghetto bachelorette. 

I'm not shallow, or am I? I mean they were of all shapes, sizes, a ginger-- I mean, the only thing all of my exes had in common was their hairline (me and a couple girlfriends got drunk and took an hour finding my ""type"" and it was a hairline no doubt) and yes I joke and try to make light of it but it's more because if I don't I might go insane. What I do ask for is, common interests, mine are pretty common amongst a lot of men. Technology, I work in IT, I love video games, TV, movies, I mean, I am an introvert, not that I don't go do things out of my comfort zone on purpose: they are still ""out of my comfort zone"".

But if I am going to date someone I ask for few things, being able to read and write is huge to me, literacy is key. I would probably hate my life if I received a text at work like *""hay bae can u pick up sum milk plz""* someone once used the term sapiosexual but my track record doesn't back that. I am also a little quirky personality wise, I am quite passive and at all costs I strategically avoid arguments. So obviously, my ideal match would be the type to talk instead of argue, to me the concept is simple, you have a conversation and you find a solution and you just move forward.

So far in dating, I have been told on the first date that I am passive like his ex, and that's just because I said I believe that we should ""exist and allow others to exist"". Obviously no 2nd date.

I went on 2 dates with one gentleman,  but he was very broken, not in a bad way-- just in a *""why are you dating please get help""* kind of way? No third date.

I went on 2.5 dates with one guy, it seemed to go really well, the half date was where things went downhill, we made plans, I showed up at his place, he never answered the door. He later claimed he passed out, which was true I believe that. But when we made more plans again he got really weird, I told him I was excited to see him, then a couple of messages later he said something like *""Unlike last time""* (referring to when he fell asleep) and I said *""it's no big deal""* and he got highly emotional and thought I was saying he was no big deal? We left our separate ways amicably but I told him he wouldn't be very healthy for me and that it was pretty toxic and I don't think he liked hearing that. 

2 dates were boring, nothing to report there, we weren't compatible. 

One guy, this guy was definitely my people, first date was baller. We got along, talked for hours, then the next day we hung out again, this time at his place and talked literally all night watching movies. Then abruptly he had to go back to the UK because his dad was gravely ill, we talked the whole time he was gone and made plans for when he got back, and when I got back from a work convention. He came back and his last message to me was his daughter missed him and was ""poorly affected by his absence"" and nothing after. I suspect that he got back with his ex, it seemed like one of those toxic on and off relationships from the hours that we discussed our shit, so I made assumptions and moved on.

One guy, we went on one date, NO SEX mind you, but somehow he felt comfortable texting me the next day, to ask me that.... if he parked his car outside my condo would I give him a blowjob? (in his car while my children were upstairs alone AWAKE) It was pretty demeaning to say the least, I don't remember what I said in return but I remember it was good, he still made another account after I blocked him and messaged me anyways though. 

Then the half date, we talked for weeks, he had kids was busy, going through some life changes, I get that. I was as supportive as possible, tried to offer resources to help him take care and I maybe ignored some red flags, attributing them to stress. We played some League together and he legit started smashing his desk and we DIDN'T EVEN LOSE THE MATCH. More concerning is that his kids were there witnessing that, and a few other things I don't feel I need to go into detail on.

We made plans to go out on the Friday that just passed actually, and not one word from him, all day. Not a single read on my message to him, until it's like dinner time and he sends me a picture of his kids. No words, I was not happy, but I gave him the weekend to redeem himself, maybe say words at least for wasting my time. Not a single message either way since he notified me he was busy by sending me a photo of his children. So today I told him a few choice words, I hate to admit it but I'm horrible at making jokes at the worst of times and I said he *""raised more red flags than Communist Russia,""* but I made sure to leave it off at, *""I liked you and that's not a good thing, seeing as you had no consideration for my time which is also precious. I decided to tell myself I deserve better, please don't contact me""*  also loosely using those quotes because I don't think that's verbatim and I don't really care to open facebook and re-read it but I know it's damn close.

So I popped back on the dating site, and it feels futile honestly. Like I'll never meet someone who's like me, who's got that chill level. Who just wants to exist and let exist.

This is long already, I just needed to kinda get it out, like, if I do ever find my person, it'll be nice. I make a lot of funny jokes alone at midnight and that's when I wish I had my person there to enjoy that with me and it be a *""you had to be there""* kinda moment. It just sucks going through the bombardment of messages from men that are either unintelligible or downright disgusting in the meantime.",01May2019,8
32,"So I've been going to this sort of social club for the past 5 years. I also worked there. We are usually around 20 to 30 people. Last year however it was different, working there felt stressful and I felt really unappreciated for all the effort I was putting in (tbf I was too invested). 
There were times when I was just alone and bored. No one would talk to me and for someone like me who's kind of a people person it felt like shit.

I decided to stop going (from june 2018 til december 2018). It was a big deal because Ive attended the meetinga every week since I came to live here in 2014.

This year I was afraid, but decided to come back. I thought it was going to be awful because 2 of my closest friends had moved out, but that actually made it better. They used to be the centre of attention most of the time so now that theyre gone I kind of started standing out.
I don't enjoy being the centre of attention all the time, but I love getting compliments and people finding me funny. Back in 2014 and 2015 the same thing used to happen, although back then it was caused by my strong desire to be likeable.. nowadays it feels more natural, like its just caused by my personality.

Idk, just wanted to share how amazing it feels to be accepted, complimented, loved. When people find you funny, interesting, they want to get to know you, hang out with you even outside of where you meet them normally, etc.

Im usually told that I seem intimidating at first, and Im also very selective regarding who I befriend, so that makes it really hard to kind of ""exploit my potential."" On the other hand this group makes it way easier because it encourages everyone to engage in conversation, and thats where I shine imo...

Anyway, I feel great! Its like being the popular teenager at school, only the adult version. A nice self esteem boost indeed.


Fun fact: I have a habit of documenting how I feel and what I do. I've noticed that in the past 5 years there has been a tendency: my happiest months are april, may and june and the ones during which I struggle the most are january and february.
For now, 2019 seems to be going that way too! The math checks out :p",01May2019,2

I spilled a drink on the counter right by the stove. Almost slipped down those wooden stairs countless times.

It's funny, trying to place myself back in those spaces is like being an imposter in someone else's memories.

37,When I was a kid something bad happened to me that left me scarred in sexual stuff. It never really got dealt with so it manifested itself in various different ways over the years. When I was in middle school it was always wanting to have sex and now I’m scared to even touch someone really because I’m scared they’ll think I’m like my abuser. I met this girl though. She’s so great. We both don’t want a relationship with each other but we both like each other sexually. We been doing stuff (not in real life over like the phone or whatever) and we’ve kissed twice. I think I’m getting over it and feeling safe with her. Tonight was really intense and I actually enjoyed myself. But after it was over I felt immense guilt and like I was going to throw up. And I did. But after I did I felt way better. I think this is a step in the right direction to help me feel comfortable again. I feel like a human and a teenager again and I love it.,01May2019,5
38,"My entire life I have only ever lived in the past or the future. At all times I am obsessing over the things I have done, the memorable experiences, the people I have loved and felt inspired by but no longer speak to. Other times I’m obsessing over the things I want to do, the places I want to go, the people I want to meet and be surrounded by and be inspired by.

But whenever I think of the present I feel nothing but anxiety and like nothing is where I want it to be. I just find myself wishing I could go back in time, or that I could be living a new existence in a future that isn’t here yet. This seems to create stagnation and only ensures the future I want never gets here or at the very least is delayed. 

Does anyone else feel like this? How do I get out of it. How do I learn to just go with the flow and not worry about it, or create the future I want?",01May2019,3

In fact, some people actually tell me that I look cool when I hide my face with those stuffs, but people call me an ugly alien when I am not hiding my face. Should I blame my parents for giving me a disaster?

42,"I have been regularly watching porn since I was about 14-15. It was my go-to for some stress relief, and I found it much more enjoyable then closing my eyes and fantasizing.
I never really considered whether it is unhealthy or if it affected me in any way because I know its quite common and I know that all of my male friends, and that many of my female friends do it.

I have seen plenty of articles describing the effect porn-watching has on people but I never paid any attention to them, because they all seemed to push different agendas or written by very biased people (booo, porn bad!)

But 31st December 2018 I decided to stop watching porn, and this is my experience so far. 

So I was very curious if I would find it difficult, or that I would miss it, or have any ""withdrawal"" effects, but it was really really easy to stop. The biggest issue was that I had to kinda start fantasizing on my own and make up my own ""stories"" and ""porn"" in my head, which was quite difficult, and because my fantasizes need to be somewhat plausible I spent quite some time before each ""session"" before I could get going. So my solution was to use tinder for a lot of casual sex and hookups because without porn I felt like I didn't have a proper way of getting it out of my system. 

After a while, things calmed down a little, and I started dating someone, but my sex drive is a lot lower than what it used to be and I don't find that to be a good thing when dating someone. This is so far the biggest issue. I actually had my first case of ""not getting it up"" even though I wanted to (which is funny because lots of the ""porn baaaad"" articles says that porn causes this, not the other way around.) 

The good thing about a lower sex drive is that I am a lot less distracted and my attention span is a lot better which been noticed at work (no wonder teenage girls outperform teenage boys in school!), also I manage to get things done at home and home office is now a real possibility (the ones where you actually get anything done)

I also come to enjoy sex more. It's hard to describe how but I think that when I was hornier, I was ""too"" horney, and actually had to be focused on holding back my orgasm, which made it hard to become as immersed in the sex as I would like to. That changed now, and I really love it. 

Was it worth it? I am not really sure, to be honest, I guess time will show. I suspect the ""first having a really high sex drive, and then a really low one"" might even out",01May2019,22
43,"So, I'm a college student, I major in the arts, and I met a girl in my class. We're both lesbian, she's incredibly cute, and we have so many of the same interests despite having near opposite personalities. The only reason we started talking was because I've been to her home town in China when I went on a trip there. I don't speak Chinese fluently, but it was enough to get her to open up to me, despite our conversations mostly being in English.

We grew to be very close very fast, mainly because I invited her out to eat with me a lot. I don't think she saw them as romantic advances (like I intended them to be) but I'm not one to go against the grain unless there's consequences. There is no concequence against letting her decide how to take my advances. 

With our closeness came pet names and a weird relationship dynamic. She calls me honey, baby, and sweetie. (I think it's because pet names are really common between girls in China, but also because she has trouble saying my name and gets really embarrassed looking like she doesn't know how to.) In return, I call her bro (simply because it makes her laugh a lot, I can pronounce her name thanks to four years of Chinese classes.) She also gets very touchy with me, which I normally don't allow since I've had very bad experiences in the past being touched. However, I don't flinch or get nervous when she does it. Sappy as hell.

She's also seen me upset a few times. I feel bad breaking down because I'm afraid of how she'll look at me as a result. I have emphasised that I can take care of myself when I'm upset (and I can!) but once I told her I why I didn't want her seeing me like that, she insisted she talk to me. Despite her rough English (and I doubt her classes taught her how to have a tough heart-to-heart with someone so distressed) she did her best to express how even if I didn't want to share my thoughts with her, I shouldn't be nervous that she'd think anything less of me because she sees me as an equal. I don't think I've ever had anyone say that to me so bluntly. It's a breath of fresh air, seeing as many people see me as a comic relief in their lives.

Needless to say, I've fallen for her, but I cherish her as a friend just as much. My friends have been pushing me for ages to ask her out, but I can't seem to find the courage. I know she is wildly out of my league. I'm not ugly, but I'm certainly not her level of pretty. I'm very...dykish, if that's a word. That, and I'm not sure she'd prefer someone who speaks Chinese fluently or not. There's also the issue that uh, in her country people can go to JAIL for 20(?) years for being gay. Not sure how much she cares about that last one, but Jesus, there's a lot of hurdles. Can you blame me for backing down?

So, I had my last chance today, and I let her go back home without letting her know because I felt like I'd get turned down. I won't see her for 3 months, but that's okay. I think I'll take this time to get better, maybe lose some weight and see how our friendship fairs long distance. Once classes start back up again, I'll see if I still feel like asking her out.",01May2019,1

I don’t want pity or advice. I want to be able to stop thinking for a while. I want to withdraw from the timeline and not worry about a goddamn thing for just a second.

so after a while visiting reddit not so regularly, i decided to open an account so I can post and reply people's post. That was a week ago. Since then I have a few impressions to share with you to see if you had the same impression than me.

&amp;#x200B;

1. People is more easy going than it seems. So yes, obviously you'll find eventually an asshole trying to ruin your day, but so far what I can see in here is that people is not trying to pretend (what happens a lot in FB). It's mostly a community where people like to share a lot of thoughts, or cats, or nudes, or whatever. Which is pretty cool. 
2. It's a perfect way to keep you up to date about international news. I realised that depending about in what country you are, you can get one news or another. So it seems pretty neutral to come here and check the correct sub to find what you're looking for.
3. Wasting time at work properly. Instead of  checking stupid FB videos about cats.
4. Anonymity, and of course, proper nudes for some lonely nights.
5. You can share your not common pleasures with people around the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Middle school sucked for me but not in the traditional sense. I went to a magnet school where the elementary school and middle school were the same school- so you knew all the same people from age 5 to age 12/13. 

I was a super fucking hyper kid in elementary school. Super annoying too. I took ADD medication but I was still off the walls. However, in elementary school 'cliques' hadn't really developed yet. People had friends they'd walk around with, but everybody generally hanged out together. Freeze-tag, soccer, etc. Elementary was fun, even though I didn't have any 'true' friendships where I'd get invited outside of school to people's birthday party's. Tbf I never invited other people to my birthday party's. I just sucked at socialized. But overall, it was fun. 

The climax was probably 5th grade when the school got involved because I claimed to be 'bullied' by this one kid. Parents got involved and everything. We even had a class discussion about it- he was crying, and had his sweater covering up his whole head. We were all sitting in a circle 'indian-style.' The teacher sitting next to me whispered into my ear that I should  tell him 'its okay' and make-up. 

For whatever reason, I refused to and sat and said nothing. I was a dick. Even the teacher got pissed at me. I had the maturity at least to realize by the time I was a freshman in high school that I was never actually bullied by that kid. I would run around at recess, running in circles around him and his friends trying to get him to chase me. Occasionally he would. The worst thing he ever did was 'stab' my arm with a stapler once, but it was more of a joke than a malicious thing. I later found out he had a shit load of issues- he was a cutter and even showed his scars to other people once and apparently had a whole lot of his own issues. I generally feel shitty about the whole thing in retrospect. 

He was fairly popular and honestly while nobody hated me for what happened, it didn't necessarily me super popular either. I was a shitty kid and was obsessed with being chased. I would get mad that I was never allowed to be the goalie when we played soccer so once I stole the soccer ball and eventually got the noon-duty to intervene and force them to let me be the goalie. I won't say 'don't judge me' because you SHOULD judge me. I was a shitty kid then and arguably am still that shitty kid at heart, which I'll get to later. 

Once I hit 7th grade, after 'middle school' had started, I abruptly lost my toddler-like lack of self-awareness. I calmed the fuck down, massively, and was no longer AS off-the walls as I had been, though I still had the occasional spaz-out. I was no longer obvious to the fact that people 'had friends' and 'friend groups'. 

In retrospect I was shockingly philosophical about it. I thought I was some sort of anthropologist, observing how all the different kids hung out in various cliques. Our school was majority ""Mexican"" and I think I became aware of race for the first time in 7th grade. I started to notice that all the Mexican kids hung out at the same lunch-table and they all played soccer together. They were one massive clique that I struggled to try and stay apart of through 7th and 8th grade but failed miserably at. Throughout 6th/7th grade I'd find it harder and harder to build up the nerve to walk out to the soccer field at lunch and play with them. I started to feel more and more like I didn't belong. I was the only white kid there most of the time, I sucked at soccer and constantly made a fool of myself (nobody made fun of me surprisingly). 

That's the thing that shocks me when I look back at middle school as an adult. Why didn't anybody bully me? I was such an annoying, awful little shit who deserved harder than anybody to get some sense knocked into me. I think part of it was our great teachers/principal who made our school so safe. They did not tolerate any bullying. I actually really regret more people not physically hurting me because I feel like that would have 'shook' me into reality and realizing what a little dick I was. I was honestly probably more of a bully, relatively, than anybody at that school.

Then there 'the smart rich kids' who were all super nice to me and they all talked to me but I wasn't friends with any of them. I was in a lot of the 'advanced' classes (one was an advanced math-style class at 5am in the morning, can't even recall the name of it now, I ended up failing it because I couldn't stay awake and never did the work. The teacher was an old woman who I could tell hated my guts).

I had two kids who I would play Runescape with, there was a group of 4-5 of us starting in the 7th grade. We walked around at lunch talking all the time about runecscape in 7th grade. There were the closest I had ever come to having 'real' friends although I never went to their birthday parties (and I had never had the insight to invite them to mine). They were both super Nice to me though. I loved that even though I was such a shitty kid they still made me a part of their group. While we weren't super close friends I still appreciate they ever accepted me in the first place. 

I had loved reading since 5th grade and I was starting to get more and more into books. 8th grade was where it felt like my life fell apart at school. I was reading Eragon I think, on the first day of school. I decided to go sit at the curb instead of socializing outside the classrooms with everybody else. Either I didn't want to or couldn't. 

For the first time in my life, I realized what a fucking loser I was, and I realized how fucking miserable I was. It had taken me 12 years for it to finally click in my head that 'I don't have any friends, I don't hang out with other kids outside of school, nobody speaks to me and I don't talk to my runescape buddies nearly as much anymore. 

I think I thought I was better than everybody else. Reading, and the other teachers complimenting my love of it, had inflated my ego to such a point that I considered myself a fucking intellectual. I was constantly 'philosophizing' everything in my head and thought I was freaking socrates or something. I was no longer the spastic freak I had been in elementary school. I was super calm, but I was also too terrified or unwilling to talk to other people. 

I never went to the soccer field any more, or the basketball courts where all the rich, smart kids hung out (with the poor, white/black kids).  Walking to the side of the 'field' felt so terrifying to me. I soon discovered a 'trick' where I could pretend to go to the bathroom 3-4x at lunch, and kill 15-20 minutes hiding in there essentially (though in my mind I wasn't hiding, just pretending to pee). 

Initially, I would just swing at the swing-set by myself, (where my runescape friends would occasionally walk by and rescue me from my humiliation). Later in the year, I became too self-conscious to go to the swings anymore and would just walk around the classrooms at lunch, ( I was too embarrassed to just sit somewhere and read my book, I thought that would make me look like a loser). 

Once, a kid asked me why I didn't invite him to my birthday party, but in a jovial way. ""I love parties bro!"" he said in a happy tone of voice. I didn't know why I didn't ever ask people to hang out with my outside of school. It just didn't register as something I was allowed to do. 

To say the least. high school wasn't much better, although I won't make this post any longer by describing that stage of my life. I had 'video game friends' who I grew apart from. I had people try to invite me to hang outside of school and I refused. Had a couple friends in college but I now wonder if it was a pity friendship. I continued to make the same mistakes in college, until the point where people just stopped inviting me to stuff. I feel pretty dead inside as an adult right now, friendless, loveless, and without a job still living at my parents house. 

I've always lacked any sense of observational awareness of other people or my surroundings, and I've always sub-consciously felt superior to other people. I have spent the last 4 months since graduating college just sitting around, browsing reddit, and contemplating what the fuck to do with my life. To make matters worse, I've gone about wasting the money my dad gives me trying to become an alcoholic, which does seem to bring a great degree of emotional relief while it lasts.",01May2019,1

I’m not afraid of being alone, I’m afraid that I may spend too much time to myself that I forget people. I deleted my messenger app, deactivated my personal twitter account. These days, people are getting more annoying to an extent that I would just silently hiss. 

Tho, I still casually bond with my cousins, I’ve come to a point that I’ve decided to bond with people thru real human connection and presence. I feel like social media is such pure shit, people seem fake in a way that it really really pisses me off.

I think I spend half ( or more than ) of the day with myself and do things that I love to avoid being in misery or worry about my future. More often than not, if I find myself doing nothing, I tend to worry or overthink about myself lmao.

Another reason why i spend too much time for myself is bcos, some times i really don’t have the energy to talk to people and i don’t know why. Like, yeah I’d gladly listen to you but don’t expect me to say that much. I am partially afraid of speaking what is on my mind.

I think I’ve lost my communication skills.

71,"Throw away account because I'd probably die if my brothers ever knew how I felt. 

I (32/F) have two brothers, one who's a couple years older, and one a few years younger. Growing up we never got along. In fact, I seriously loathed my brothers for most of my life. When I saw other girls with brothers who loved, protected, and cherished them, I was in awe... like how could that possibly exist? How do they manage it? What does that feel like?

 My older brother was always so mean to me. He never said anything nice, but rather played on all my insecurities and used them to hurt me. He beat me up. He made fun of me in front of other people, in front of my parents, and no one ever defended me. I could never properly defend myself in a way that would make a difference. I was always the loser in those battles. In spite of it all, I've always admired him. He's incredibly witty, and funny. He always makes me laugh with his super dry sense of humor, but I don't think he's ever intended to make me laugh, he's just being himself. Growing up, I wanted to be just as funny. I would try to be sarcastic, and funny back, but he always took it as me trying to be mean. I was just antagonizing him. My dad once told me my brother loved me until I learned to talk. Essentially saying, it was my fault for ruining any relationship we had (even though I was too young to know right from wrong). I can't remember a time my older brother was ever nice to me. I've always been an embarrassment for him. He'd never be seen with me if he could help it. The last and probably only time we've ever hugged was about 20 years ago, when I jokingly forced one on him, and I'm sure it was one of the worst moments I've ever inflicted on him. 

For the last decade I've made serious attempts to be a good sister. But the times I've tried to be myself, it blows up in my face. He gets angry, offended, and takes it the wrong way. I'm just a nuisance. 

Several years ago, he and I were on vacation with my mom. He resented the fact that I was there to begin with. I'm sure he felt that I was ruining his experience, and wished I'd never come with. The last day we were there, he'd had enough and took the opportunity to tell me all the reasons why he and my little brother hated me. I cried. I screamed. I told him all I wanted was a big brother. All I wanted was to have a normal relationship, but I couldn't accomplish that on my own. I was so hurt. I still cry about it, years later. At family get togethers, we barely speak. We almost never make eye contact. We basically pretend the other person doesn't exist. If he ever did anything nice toward me now, I honestly wouldn't know how to react. It would be so out of the ordinary, it would just be incredibly awkward. 

As for my little brother, I know my terrible relationship with him is entirely my fault. In my adult years, I've been putting forth a lot of effort to make up for the horrible ways I treated him. I want so much for him to be happy. He struggles a lot as an adult and it kills me to see him hurting. I blame myself. I tell him I love him, I try to give advice when he's struggling, though I don't think he wants to hear it. I try to hug him when I see him, though that is still awkward because it isn't something we've ever done really. But growing up, I deflected a lot of my pain onto him. He was half my size, but I beat him up. Made fun of him, and basically treated him like shit. It's probably the single greatest regret of my life. You don't need to comment on how shitty that was of me, I know I am garbage for it. I would do anything to take it back. I can only assume I justified my behavior toward him by feeling that since my older brother did it to me, then it's only fair that I get to do it to someone too. He and I have slowly been mending our relationship, but I don't think he's entirely interested. He wants friends, not a sister. 

And that's what I'm struggling so hard to come to terms with. Neither of my brothers really care that I exist. They've never loved me. Neither of them reach out and see if I'm still alive. Neither ever them have ever once called me. We never have that ""hey, how are you doing"" conversation. I've heard siblings sometimes don't come together until their parents pass away, but I don't want that to happen. So much life wasted without the love of my brothers. It's all I've ever wanted to feel like I'm not a sore they have to endure. But I also wouldn't know how to handle it if they did love me. I imagine that I would feel incredibly awkward and embarrassed.

I needed to let this out to someone. Anyone. I've been holding onto this pain all my life. I'm open to any advice anyone can offer. I can't imagine just outright telling my older brother how I feel. I still admire him, and revealing my vulnerability to him would be so difficult. I don't think he'd know what to do if I told him how I felt, besides just listen and not respond. And even if he did say, ""I care about you, and I want a good relationship too"" I don't think either of us would know where to go from there. 

But I feel better know that maybe someone else will read this and know what I'm talking about. Someone else could relate and share some sympathy. I think I just need a little sympathy. To know that I'm not the only one so unloved by the people who mean the most to me.",01May2019,7

Today i tried to make a candle.
That's all.
I wanted to make an orange scented candle, because i like candles and to make things, i had the wax and the color as well.
I waited for my grandmother to get out of the house because i know she was going to be mad at me if i touched her things, like the stove.
I melted the wax but then something went wrong since the container i used was slightly broken and i spilled the wax on the counter, no big deal i just cleaned.
But then she came back and i didn't had the time to clean the saucepan.
I tried to be fast but not all the wax came off since it was hard already.
I put the saucepan to soak and i went to my room hoping she didn't notice and just cleaned the fucking saucepan.

I was wrong. 
10 minutes later she started screaming telling me that i was cooking the drug. I don't know what drug is orange and wax-like but looks like she knows there is one.

She now think i am a drug addict, she yelled that i am going to overdose and die and that it's my sister fault because apparently she's a drug addict too (she is not).

At first i thought it was fun and that she's just old and paranoid and an idiot.
Then it hit me like a punch in my chest.
I am tired to live with this woman, she is awful.
I am a good girl, not in a reaching-a-lot-of-goals way, since i have depression and i dropped out of school, but i never smoked, nor drinked or took drugs. I'm always home, except when i go to my boyfriend of two year's house.

97,"I completed my Foundation Degree back in 2010 and was at the top of my class at the time. I even achieved a bursary during my FDSc for some of the research that I completed in my final year. As a result I decided to stay on for an additional year to complete my BSc at the same college.

Unfortunately four months into my BSc year I was struck down by an abscess in my leg which resulted in a sepsis infection. This resulted in emergency surgery to my legs and due to the mess this left behind I was stuck having to visit a nurse daily for six months for dressing changes where I could not be guaranteed a regular appointment time.  This was the time before remote working was truly possible (I went to an agricultural college so the facilities were very much antiquated compared to an inner-city university) so in order to use study materials there I had to be physically on site.  Due to the placement and the size of the wound from my surgery, I was also unable to drive long distances like the 60 mile round trip to my college and back. This was also not helped by how bad public transport is in the UK.

As you can imagine the whole thing really put me in a bad place emotionally and mentally.  When trying to attempt coursework I was met with a mental block which drove me to drop out with a plan to finally return to finish what I started.

At the point I was taken ill I was working as a waitress in a US themed restaurant. Obviously with the damage to my leg from the surgery I found it increasingly difficult and felt more and more exhausted at the end of each shift.  My degree area is in an outdoors based subject field so most jobs in that area were physically demanding.  As a result of this I ended up applying for an office temping agency, getting a desk based role at the company I am at now.  As my partner owns a business in the field my foundation degree was in, I was able to keep my hand in and not lose touch with the subject area I am passionate about.  My partner lives 60 miles away so I have ended up splitting up my time between working in the city and heading to my partners in the country.

The first few years in the office job were ok.  I enjoyed it, they paid well etc. I was moved to my current role three years ago in a subject area which was completely new to me.  My managers at the time were amazing and had a an I place to achieve what we needed. I took my direction from them and as I was still learning the subject matter area, I took their word as what needed to be done.  

In October last year I went on holiday with my parents for eleven days in Spain. Two days in, I found my dad collapsed in a hotel room. He ended up spending three days in a foreign hospital and an additional week in a UK hospital once we returned home. I come from a small family, and my brother lives in the US, so I was the only one there to support my mum and dad through all of this.  I finally returned to this destination in March and discovered an amazing National Park which finally made me rediscover what I loved and what drove me towards studying my Foundation Degree.

A month ago I finally decided to go back and complete that final year to get my BSc and today I finally submitted my application.  I have decided to go back part time, but still need to work out how to fit this around work as I have bills to pay. I may have to look for jobs elsewhere, but I know that I have the experience.  This is going to be a big task to manage, but I know that if I don’t do it now, that I will keep putting it off.

106,"If I could tell my past self something...I’d say this.

Don’t be so harsh on yourself because you did nothing wrong in your relationships besides being stubborn. You tried your best and stayed longer than you should’ve — putting yourself at risk. 

It’s okay to be frustrated and to cry. Let those emotions out instead of bottling them. Crying doesn’t mean you’re weak. It just means you’ve had enough and need to let it out. 

You should stand your ground. No means no. Don’t fall under his pressure because he’s a toxic piece of shit. He’s not going to respect you and he’ll take advantage of you. Don’t believe his lies. 

It’s okay to have trust issues. It shouldn’t be *normal* but you can’t just blindly trust people you *think* you know. Not everyone is nice as you thought. 

It’s okay to forget the past. It was very traumatic and it’s your coping mechanism. Don’t try to remember something negative because you don’t need that.

Lastly, don’t forget to follow the light within you. You may lose sight of it but it’s always there. After everything you’ll go through...just remember you have yourself. Hold onto that.",01May2019,1
107,"I don't even know what to think. It happened by accident almost, me finding out. We smoked a giant blunt and were just chatting about random things, looking at pics on his Instagram and talking about them. We started talking about Coachella. He then said that his best friend's (Sam) brother, Mark, actually went to Coachella this year. I was shocked because of the cost and asked who bought Mark the tickets because I figured he couldn't have afforded it. He said Mark's GF (Kristin) bought them tickets to go to the festival EVERY day for the 12 or so days. I was like, ""What?! Is she made of money?? What's the deal there?"" And he told me that Kristin's family was incredibly affluent and her father alone was worth upwards of $30 mill. 
Crazy...but then he goes on to say,""Yeah, and Sam is there stuck with fucking Ashley who does rub n' tugs for a living! I guess Mark is living the dream for all us."" My bf has very conservative views. Ashley is actually a massage therapist at a franchise massage parlor. She makes a good living for herself. She's always incredibly nice, cool, and fucking beautiful. I told him to stop it cause I know how he gets, and reiterated that Ashley was a very nice, sweet, beautiful girl who Sam was lucky to have. He stated he knew Ashley was great, ""but...she's like us....comes from nothing, poor, not like Kristin."" That made me stop in my tracks because...I fit that exact description. I am an orphan who came from literally nothing, who has been poor my whole life, homeless multiple times, pulled myself out of the gutter even more times, have a very blue-collar job, and still live paycheck-to-paycheck. I looked at him and asked ""What does that mean? Is Ashley no good? Is she lesser-than Kristin because she doesn't come from money?"" And he could tell I was getting upset and ignored my questions and changed the subject. I asked him again ""How do you look at me if you think that way? Like you think you could do better than me and you got the shit end of the stick?"" 
Now he knows how sensitive money is for me BECAUSE I've always been poor and my entire life has been dedicated to NOT being poor. I went to college, got a Bachelor's degree while working two full-time jobs, and ALWAYS try to do better. I'm never satisfied with my progress and continually push myself harder because I've never been out of debt, no matter how hard I've tried. I've never had less than two jobs at a time. I know how hard I try and that I'm a good person and deserve respect. I don't ask anyone for anything because I've always been by myself. And that just hit so close to home for me and made me see him in a whole new light.
 Does he talk to his friends about me like that? Is this what he truly thinks, especially of me? We have a lot of communication/trust issues both from us coming from very rough backgrounds so IDK. I mean shit, it would've been great if my boyfriend was a millionaire...but I don't think about ""damn, if only he had money. he would be so much better if he was rich."" I don't think like that at all...I just feel so disappointed. We've had our fair share of issues and this is just another cherry on top where I feel like...fuck. I'm just convenient for him. He has a young son who I've been raising like my own...I take him to school every day and help him with homework and try to do things to bond with him. We have a good relationship and I care about that little boy so much. This isn't the first time he's said things like that on the fly. He says them pretty often. I just...I just...I'm heartbroken. I don't need anything, I just needed to tell someone. We've confirmed previously he doesn't love or trust me because of the aforementioned communication/trust issues. And I've made my peace with that. But shit, not even respect? I don't even get some fucking respect? I'm devastated.",01May2019,2

At school (I'm in my last semester) I have classmates I hang out with during breaks and sit with in class, but it's not like I can really call them friends. There is nothing wrong with them, they are amazing and I'm very grateful for them. They just aren't friends and I don't think that I would want them as friends either, how horrible that might sound.

It's just that whenever anyone makes a move, sending a text or wanting to do stuff after school/work, I don't want to? It annoys me and I feel like I don't want/need that? However I am lonely 90% of the time. I feel like all I want to do is just be with people and do stuff. Go to the movies, getting a drink, simply hang out. Still if someone actually asks me to do those things, I don't want to.

His job had nothing to do with ignoring me and posting snaps with other girls. He just needed to send goodnight and I love you texts. So because he didn’t I bought myself a ring. I am so broken hearted because of him. I can’t chase him again like I did for the past year.

115,"Apologise, this will probably be a long post, but I really need to vent. 

Bit of history. I was in a relationship with a guy from 16yrs old to 28yrs old. In that time adopted 2 children. I worked 2 jobs and he was stay at home parent. There was domestic violence and I eventually left. That was 3 yrs ago. We are now, weirdly, on good terms and are co-parenting really well, with me having the boys (8 and 10yrs) 3 days a week. 

I dated for 18months, but really struggled with self esteem and ended up having some therapy. I then dated a much older guy (45m) for 18months but I left him in January as I felt that I was putting in all of the effort.

I am stuck now. I know what I am worth, I know I am a good person and reasonably attractive, but I am struggling to date again. 

No one around me understands what it is like to be so alone. I live on my own (with 2 cats) I have no close family, all of my friends are coupled up. I can easily go for days without seeing or speaking to anyone, I close my door and that's it, it's just me. I feel that I have no one in my life who cares at all, I once had it all and now I have nothing.  I want to be loved and cared about.

118,"I got caught smoking weed today. It's absurd because I'm 28. 

I bought a house with this girl I was in a relationship with but with a down payment assistance bond that doesn't mature for 2.5 more years. 

We broke up over a year ago, now she's engaged and her fiance has lived here for over six months. They're getting married in December. 

Did I have a problem with it? No. I was 100% understanding and okay with it, I gave them all the space and kept to myself in my room, which is rather large. I've just been working and trying to get myself in a position to save money to leave when the bond matures. 

She has such a twist in her undies over weed. I scheduled an appointment with a medical doctor to get in the clear but she's just one of those bizarre people who hates weed. 

She asked how much it would take to get me to leave so I told her. Now I'm waiting because she texted me that ""the lender"" will be here tonight; whether they're here to hand me a check and cut me out of the house or if she's trying to snitch I don't know.

It's just a misdemeanor offense, I'm not worried, but I'm also sick as fuck of living here, with my ex, her fucking fiance, in this fucking house. I'm past my expiration date here. 

The amount I requested will cover moving and getting a foothold back where I'm from. I put out some feelers on facebook, see if I could repair some bridges that have lapsed in 5 years. 

I've been waiting on the lender all day. I'm sick to my stomach, can't eat, can't smoke weed, can't do jack shit. I'm fucking ready to get that check and make a call for someone to drive and pick me up and be out of here before the end of the weekend.

124,"Monday:

This week began with a phone call from my mom right after school. Usually it's to organize arrangements for taking my brother home, but I knew from the seconds of silence before she spoke that this had nothing to do with him. 

I heard the petrified quivering in her voice. I sensed the exhaustion in her words. I felt the dread creep up in her deafening pauses.

""Your grandma got into an accident. A guy ran the red and hit her.""

My grandma has lived her life in constant anxiety. We all think it's undiagnosed schizophrenia. Her hands incessantly ache for a cigarette between them. If not a cigarette, then a broom or a mop or a pan. She cannot stop. I assume she refuses to let herself think, since she even fears her own thoughts. 

My grandma was, for the most part, fine. Airbags didn't go off, seatbelt fastened. Only a month earlier she had gotten a ticket for wearing not wearing her seatbelt. It cost $122. She wore her seatbelt that day to avoid getting another ticket. Her life was saved by $122.

""Saba needs heart surgery and he's going to Cleveland Clinic on Thursday to see if he can get it.""

The second thing she told me. If you were wondering, these 2 events are completely unrelated, they're both relatives from opposite sides of the family. My Saba (what we call our grandpa) has been in and out of the hospital too many times to count. He's allergic to most medical marvels of today (aka antibiotics), so every time he gets admitted, we think it's gonna be the last. That man is the most unapologetically stubborn human being I've ever met, and he's managed to hold on to the reigns of life. 

I wasn't really worried. That man lived through Holocaust Germany and he can damn sure survive a plane ride to Cleveland. 

The next day, she calls me and tells me that he's in the ICU. Never even got to fly to Cleveland. He's still there. He's hanging on. My Saba put away hundreds of thousands of dollars for me to go to college. I'm his oldest grandchild, at the ripe age of 16. I want him to be there when I open my first college acceptance letter this fall. I need to see the smile on his face knowing all that money was worth it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tuesday: 

Voting for one of my main clubs happened. It's a political club and we meet once a week at lunch to discuss the news. I ran for both president and vice, hoping I could get one of the 4 spots open (2 officers per role). After losing the election for Model UN officers by a margin of 1 vote, I put all my stakes in this club. 

As I was bringing up my ballot, I saw an incredibly close friend voting for everyone except me.  

I've been asking myself why she did that ever since.

&amp;#x200B;

Wednesday:

Grandpa still in the ICU.

Election results come out. I didn't get either spot. Oh well. I've been trained in the wonderful art of not being disappointed. Everyone else running was an incumbent officer, and I am the brash outsider who doesn't even seem to have an intelligent cell in her body. (They'd be wrong, I have 3 smart cells :))

After the results, I get a stream of texts from people saying that they feel bad I didn't get any position. These condolences have only irritated me, since it's just an effortless way of ridding themselves of guilt for not voting for me. I don't feel bad about the results, and having other people tell me that they're sorry makes me agitated. Why are you upset at the results of an election when you didn't have a personal stake in the race? I get that people could just be being courteous, but that's a whole separate issue all together. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I completely understand why people wouldn't. Externally I really don't seem like the sophisticated, well-versed mold of a political club president. People who don't know me lump me with my friends: the gay theater kids who consider themselves above the rules of a traditional high school education. My credibility is who I am associated with (which is funny considering I don't even do theater). My credibility does not stem from the fact that I have had entirely straight As with the most rigorous course load for all of high school, that I tutor underprivileged children 4 hours a week, that in the 2 year span of my MUN club membership I've won 7 awards. Most members have been around since middle school and have half the amount of awards. 

I am not trying to compact my self-worth into my achievements. But I've realized that people try to quantify my credibility by labelling me from what they know about me. I can't help that. I do it too. We use the information we perceive to make a judgement about something or someone. I  know myself well enough to know I am not how I appear to the outside world. 

I'm writing this as I am just coming back from the doctors. I have to go every 3 months to get more prescriptions for ADHD, which is frankly BS since I've been on the medication for close to 7 years. My new doctor refuses to allow it any other way, and she's been monitoring my weight for some random reason. She's a stick thin vegan whereas I'm a curvy Latina who eats meat all the time. I get weighed, whatever, y'all know the drill, and at the end of the appointment she makes a comment about my weight. 

""You've gained 7 pounds since the last time I saw you. Is that intentional?""

Well no it wasn't because I didn't gain 7 pounds. Why would any weight gain be intentional when you explicitly told me to start watching it? 

She said I was 149 lbs and it went up to 156 lbs. I'm not 156 lbs. I'm 153. 

I politely tell her that she's wrong, the nurse read the weight wrong, and I can go reweigh myself to confirm that I'm right. 

The audacity of her to tell me that it's ok that I gained 7 pounds and that I didn't have to lie to her since she was my doctor. 

I threw off my shoes, paraded out the door, and stood on the scale. My confidence faded as the numbers on the scale hopped from 146 to 160. It finally settled on a crisp 152.2 and I dramatically revealed the number to her. (Yes, it's extra but I was pissed from earlier today). 

I drove home with a blank stare on my face the entire way. I was so conflicted. I had no credibility with my schoolmates. My close friend didn't even vote for me. My doctor didn't even believe me when I stated the nurse done goofed up my weight. I have had so many accomplishments, but people believe that who my friends are trump all of them.

TL;DR- Grandma got into a car crash. Unrelatedly, other grandpa needs to fly to Cleveland for potential heart surgery. Before he could, he landed himself in the ICU and is still there.

Results came out today, and I didn't get any position I ran for since most people think I'm unintelligent (literally quite the opposite lol).

125,"I woke up today and felt empty. A conversation resonated with me about the idea of not caring towards a situation. I realized my 9-5 has created a completely apathetic existent for a majority of my day. A few aspects are there to prevent me from completing going numb, but it’s not a good situation. I feel slightly sick to my stomach some days with the amount of not caring I have reached.  

I am, by nature, a very passionate person. I do not trust my boss to talk about these issues. I know the correct course is to find a new job - but that is always tricky and time consuming. I look for the silver lining. “At least I have a good paying job...” I think to myself. But that honestly feels like an empty motivator. I decided I won’t leave until I find another offer. While I have savings, it is not the correct move at this stage in my life.
