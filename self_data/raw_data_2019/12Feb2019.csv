0,"Its so easy to say ""I'm an introvert, I recharge away from people, I don't need friends to be happy"". But I was an extrovert throughout high school. At that time, friends just kinda came to me and I didn't need to work for anything.

&amp;#x200B;

After high school, I believed I was an island, I was self sufficient and I didn't need other people. I'm starting to realize I do, I can easily make conversation with people and I'm not shy. I'm 25 now, am on track to marry my girlfriend and now I'm scrambling to find a male best friend so I can have a best man for the wedding. And making friends as an adult is HARD.

&amp;#x200B;

Its a pinch, but I feel like I can do it. And I've learned talking to people can be very pleasant(since learning not everyone is toxic like my mom). 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice for me?",12Feb2019,1
1,"The past year has been a little rough for me, filled with new and uncomfortable experiences. There’s been growth, definitely, but there’s a whole lot of anxiousness too. And that anxiousness hasn’t left much room for anything else. I feel like I’m empty and bored even when I shouldn’t be. Even when I can see there’s so much to be excited for. I just can’t. I think I’ve burnt out. And I don’t know how to get back to me. My hobbies aren’t interesting anymore, conversations with others feel like mindless small talk no matter the subject, all I do besides work/studying is switch between a few apps and watch a few shows/movies in an effort to feel something. I don’t feel depressed, I just feel like I’m... falling asleep? I don’t know how to explain it. But I’m tired of it. I really need any advice I can get. ",12Feb2019,1
2,"Im African American. I'd like to explain the feeling of grief I have when I think about my ancestors. The amount pain, torture, and abuse that most Africans experienced during the era of Atlantic slave trade is horrendous. It bothers me that I don't know my family history.  To give an example, many descendants of Jewish holocaust survivors can tell the story of their people. African Americans don't have that privilege. I don't know what my ancestors went through or even where they came from... can anyone relate or add discussion? Im looking for resources that could lead to an answer. I know I may never be able to find that answer. It hurts my soul...",12Feb2019,1

4,"I think I've made myself hurt more and more every time I expected a spouse, parent, (s)child, friend, etc to generally care about me in a non-selfinterested way. It does not matter what I say or feel and my only personal value to them is when I'm in the action of doing something for them (and still sometimes not even then). 

Realizing that I don't matter has given me the freedom to just go from task to task without arguing, assault, or giving up people that I want in my life. It also allows me to not feel bad when I have to say no to a request because they will just feign interest when they need something that I can do for them at a later time.",12Feb2019,1

6,"It seems like the older I get the more I get drained of conversations. It's not that I don't appreciate people being around but I feel like even tho we know each other or are in the same room..must we always talk?
It's like people always have these expectations of u to have something to talk about or else they would see u as boring. Or in general people are sooo terrified of this 'arkward silence' and feel presdured to talk about something but I don't even mind silencd. Must silence always be arkward? Sometimes I don't get how people always seem to have some sirt of gist to talk about. For example at work my colleges would always be talking about something and I'm just comfortable not talking to anyone and doing my work. Or even in classes everyone seems to be tied to someone and always have something to talk about. However I enjoy beeing by myself in my own world especially in classes. I find it draining to put on that smile and fake laugh about jokes that are not funny. I find it draining to over complain about something just for the sake of conversation. Sometimes I feel abnormal for it because everyone always seems to talk to each other except me which I am completely fine with tho. However Sometimes I ask myself am I normal for this? Who else feels this way?",12Feb2019,1
7,"I'm born and raised in SoCal. My wife and I have lived here all of our life. We have 2 daughters (5 &amp; 2.5) and a dog. 

I have the opportunity of a life time to take a dream job. I would be a manager for a large real-estate brokerage company, working under my mentor. I used to work for this company when I put my big boy panties on and got my first sysadmin position just over 10 years ago. It would be nearly a 25k raise plus 10% bonus. Also, 40k signing bonus and relocation cost would be covered. 

I would have 6-8 weeks to get out to the east coast (Wash. DC), where I would be put up in a hotel for a few months until my wife, kids and dog could make it out to the east coast. 

We have very little here in SoCal, my wife's family lives here but that is about it. I don't have anything here. My biggest fear is not knowing a single person, outside of my mentor and his family, and the job not working out and here I am with my entire life moved across the country with 4 other mouths to feed. 

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest, but would you do it? I have about 72 hours to decide to make a life changing decision. If I accept, I am moving myself, my career, my entire life across the country. If I decline, I will never be offered this opportunity again. ",12Feb2019,1
8,I have a brother and we hang out a lot but I still don’t really know him. I feel there is a whole other world I don’t know. The people I see everyday have their own experiences and sufferings yet I see them as they only exist when they’re in front of me.,12Feb2019,1
9,"I don't know why, it just always works out that way. I dunno if it's because I'm never around a lot of black people, so any black person feels like my family and is ""too close to home"", or if it's some internalized racism (I have a lot of that going on and it depresses me lmao), or what. 

It's really glaring to me and it almost feels unfair, but I can't change it, can I? I struggle often with feeling ""not black enough"" (even though that concept is based off of stereotypes to begin with) and this doesn't help. I'll be the first in line to say that black people are beautiful, but it feels insincere if I don't back it up with my own attractions.

Ugh. Tough shit.",12Feb2019,1
10,"ltl, ftp. I'm sorry for the wall of text but my boyfriend has heard it all already and I just need to bounce this off someone else. tl;dr: hate my job, petrified of change, what do?

I process medical claims for people in a different state than me, and I actually find the process fascinating and also rewarding to know I'm helping people out, even if incredibly tangentially. It's the production structure of this job that's totally grinding my soul into dust. They want these claims processed so quickly, there's no real time to verify the info, it's just slam slam slam one after another, beat those fuckers out or you're going to fall below standard and then get write-ups, pay docks, and on until you get canned. 

It wasn't so bad when I was only doing the one state, on established software. I was good enough to get told to do overtime, and I did as much as I could choke down. I love getting paychecks with a comma in them.  They've also had us troubleshooting some absolute dumpster fire of a piece of software they've got the junior IT guys back at HQ working on, and they're on the other side of the planet so ~~if~~ when there's a problem, it's a 4-6 hour turnaround on the email. And this software is ab-so-lute **dog shit**. It has quadrupled my processing time, at least. But corporate fucked up and locked me out of my log-ins for two and a half days, and because I couldn't make up that time (25 hours, with the mandatory OT) within the next two and a half days - as well as the 25 hours I was normally scheduled, I fell behind. I get taken off OT and I'm restricted to 40 hours a week.

I can never get a straight answer from anyone about anything. The corporate doublespeak is mind-wobbling. My QA person is known for her standard reply: ""Check the guidelines"" - which, can I just add, are the least helpful guidelines on Earth. My knowledge base is surprisingly less helpful than tits on a bull. The search function is non-functional, everything is a PDF instead of a easy to load, easy to manipulate web page. There's no cross-referencing or ability to create favorites or any sort of references. Getting a single answer is like pulling teeth and it's exhausting trying to figure out how to ask a question so I get an answer I can use. 

The last straw came last week. Well, the last two. Team meeting - pay rate is going to change. ""Don't worry, it's just onsies-twosies, you shouldn't see much difference."" Bullshit. Between the lack of OT and the pay rate reduction, the math shakes down to about a 40% pay cut. THEN. I get pulled into an office and ""verbal-written"" (huh?) about my rate - I'm at 25 claims an hour and they want ***at least*** 30. 

Think about that. I've got a claim for a $65k power wheelchair for a 12 year old boy with more diagnoses than I can remember, and he's never getting out of that chair unless it's to be cleaned by his carer, or to be put to bed by his carer, or to get out of it after it's broken and he's getting into his new one. He's on Medicare and Medicaid. He needs all sorts of adaptive parts, cushions, pads, etc, to make it comfortable and functional. And goddamn to I want to help this kid and his parents by doing this right and taking this worry off their mind, if I'm able to, according to the contract terms. There's probably 20 lines of parts I have to verify on top of everything else, as well as the contract terms and god help me if there's a COB involved. 

And I have two minutes to do it, and I'm going to get paid ***thirty-eight cents*** to do it. 

Sure, some of the claims are easy. Sometimes I run into ""pockets"" of claims, all from the same provider, and they go a little faster, but not enough to make up for the time I feel is necessary, ethical, *right*, to put into something this important. I'm disgusted by how fast I'm expected to work, how fucking mercenary this whole thing feels. I want to work in the healthcare industry but it just feels like working at a slaughterhouse. 

Ugh, I don't even want to talk about how pathetic I am and I'm terrified to look for another job because I have no marketable skills and my whole life has been failure. Sometimes I feel so fucking lost and like I'm just going through motions. I guess I just wanted someone to hear me but this post sucks. Sorry, guys.",12Feb2019,1
11,"So long complicated history with this guy, we'll call him XY. So XY and I have been coworkers for over a year. At the beginning we were clearly attracted to each other, flirting etc. and dated for a short time. However I ended things prematurely for a few reasons (life, etc.).

 Ever since we maintained we were friends but clearly feelings have still remained over the year on both sides. I even told him about it a few months ago and he said he still felt the same, but I was committed to trying my best with my new bf. 

In the past month I broke up with my boyfriend, and I was hesitant to tell XY because I wasn't sure if I wanted to jump back in. In the past month alone, we had clearly flirted with each other but even more so on my side because I was actually single now. 

I was going to tell XY BUT then I learned about a past hookup of his from our mutual friend. Anyway, that kind of threw me for a loop so I decided not to say anything. A couple days after this XY started dating a girl who was an old friend of his. 

Two days later,  I finally told him I was single in a passing conversation. I'm not sure how his dating is going or what is going on but it made me realize I need to make it clear how I feel. 

So today, in an attempt to not screw myself out of any chance of dating him again, I simply texted him asking about his relationship status and if he was available to date. He essentially said it's not super serious but it wouldn't be right right now because he is dating his friend. I simply said ok let me know if that changes.

He never replied to that, but I'm pretty happy in how I handled it and how I reacted to his answer. I'm proud I was straightforward and not hung up/devastated by his answer! I feel really good, especially after a really tough past year I'm proud of myself and I have really felt like I've grown in a way.

We have hooked up twice, but I didn’t really think of him much, I don’t even text him often. I’d say the sex was good, but generally I don’t invest too much in him.

But ever since I saw the photos a few days ago, I just couldn’t stop thinking about that girl’s face, it’s literally haunting me. The main reason is, the girl is hot, which I’m not. I started to doubt myself. Like, I’m just not hot enough, so I can’t get myself a man; or my hookup buddy said to me he just want something casual, but now he’s dating someone, so I’m just not good enough for him to date, blah blah blah that sort of thing.

I woke up from a nap, confused, and checked my phone. No. It's still Monday. Okay. It made my sense of time erratic, but looking up at the sky – the gloomy, dark consistent grey sky, the cold chill of the air, the cool wind brushing against my skin, making me want to close my eyes, the calm comfort of the darkness, the coldness; It was so relaxing.

25,"In school I was always told that the more you push yourself, the more your comfort zone will expand. I am a serious introvert, but I'm also very competitive so I took this as a challenge. So, in my first year of high school, I pushed myself to do something I never would have dreamed of doing. I gave a speech in front of an audience. I remember feeling so proud of myself after that, and still kinda do, but this didn't magically expand my comfort. After the speech, life went back to normal. Nobody said a word about it, and definitely not to me. I thought that if I did this huge social thing, people might be interested in what I have to say, and maybe think that im an approachable person. Nope. The dust settled, but I saw the same horizon

Then, a year later I became the leader of a big group at school (it was temporary; only for a project) and the same exact thing happened when I did my speech. Everything just went back to normal, as if nothing ever happened.

They said that your comfort zone will expand for every step you take, but I have found that to be very wrong. To me, expanding your comfort zone isn't something you can just do, because doing things doesn't change who you are.

Recently, I've been taking some smaller steps to raise my comfort zone. I've been trying to hold a conversation, and sometimes start a conversation. I somehow became involved with a small group of kids at my school, and have found some common ground to talk about. Now I feel slightly more ""free"" at school, I'm not sure how to describe it. I also am not sure if it had an effect on my comfort zone, because I count actions over feelings.

38,"I’m going to give a TL;DR of the situation, some details I’d have to explain in private just for privacy and what not.

So, I was dating a girl for a year, before that, we were emotionally involved/talking for a year. During this time, she’d always tell me about how she wasn’t ready for a relationship and couldn’t do it at the time, it was still too painful for her following her last relationship. She ends hooked up with another guy whilst we were talking, I was of course devastated, and of course though we weren’t in a relationship we were pretty much doing everything couples do, she’d told me she loved me at this point and had even talked about kids with me. I ended up putting that behind me and continuing our situationship. It eventually grew into something much more serious. 

We started hanging out every weekend, she’d come to my flat and stay 3-4 days and I’d go to her house and spend 3-4 days, we’d alternate and did this for months. I’d even spend time at her work with her just to have more time together, this was her asking me to do this, by the way. Anyway, she cheats on me proper last April with a guy she’d told  me not to worry about. I’m of course devastated and angry and heartbroken and what not. I forgive her same day and say that I want to work things out with her. We put things behind us and are seemingly going really well, hanging out all the time and she ends up getting a tattoo about me, talking of marriage and kids. 

Few months go by, some drama transpires with a guy on reddit beginning to contact her. She gets upset blames me for everything and says she can’t trust me anymore because of it. Rich coming from a cheater, right? Anyway, we work on this. Month goes by, we go to London for a holiday. She takes my phone and sees some messages from 2017 of old girls that I’d chatted to before we began dating and becomes infuriated that I didn’t tell her about them. Again, rich coming from someone who was sleeping with another guy at the time. She starts talking about me being untrustworthy and a liar and all this rubbish. We have a pretty up and down time there. Ends on a positive note with her crying and begging for me to miss my flight to stay with her.

Fast forward a week, she breaks up with me citing trust and distance as issues. Again really rich coming from someone who broke my trust not once but twice, led me on for about a year and then even after that, still continued to be cool with the guy she had slept with. We continue to be involved emotionally for months really up until the first of January due to more drama. She tells me it’s all my fault for breaking her heart, losing her trust and respect etc. she starts dating a guy the next week and then begins telling me things like “it’s not appropriate for me to talk to you while I’m seeing him” etc. again, this coming from a cheater.

I know it's been like five years since we last spoke, but I was filling out a crossword and came across the clue ""tax pros, for short"" and the answer was ""CPAS"". I just remember singing the song 1985 with you when we were in middle school, and we were taking turns with the lines, and when I sang ""husband's a CPA"" you gasped and laughed at me. 

But fuck that because CPA means 'certified public accountant'. It doesn't mean 'certified piece of ass'. So there. Who's laughing now.

Maybe its because I'm awkward and shy. I tried to change that and be better. I tried to wear nicer clothes , to start smiling again. To sit up straight, to walk up to people and introduce myself. I googled the body language of confidence,  i applied it. I prayed. In all of it I tried to be myself, just more open. Because surely someone would like me for me. When I was younger i had a few friends, they liked me, thought i was fun. My family loves me. I dont  objectively thimk I'm unattractive in a physical way. I know im shy, but lots of shy people still have friends. I thought it might be my acne that people had a subconcious aversion to, although i have been told i was pretty even when it was at its worst.  I've worked at it and it's  a lot clearer now. But still here I am, every row i sit in ends up empty. I alwas end up alone. Ive tried to keep my spirits up, thinking maybe  just maybe i was an outcast and i just had to find my group.

47,"I'm sick of reading/checking so many subreddits so I'll write some shit instead.

I start a job at a well known coffee shop in about a week. Tomorrow I play on going to the gym and yoga. It was really cold and there was lots of snow today.

Some of my goals include losing weight, hula hooping everyday, finishing my animal head costume, meditation, getting up/starting the day right, finishing english and Russian books I started, Russian cursive practice, reading my textbook everyday, remembering to message family and friends.

I start wanting to check out a nightclub then I change my mind. I'm so ambivalent, indecisive and I feel *wrong.* 

I just opened a pdf of a book that sounded interesting to me by Murakami. My mom is watching a Russian soap opera, so it's less fun to focus on the book i guess? or my attention went to shit. I like surreal and magic realism themes in books. 

This summer I'm starting college. I'm lonely, yet dont even want to start meeting people. I need friends and maybe to try to find a relationship because humans are social animals and its part of the life experience i guess but theres feelings holding me back.

&amp;#x200B;

I have acne and not a hugely fat but not a fit body, I'm working on changing for the better.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I gamed too much. I have a textbook that's possibly going to be used in my summer course and is relevant to my chosen future profession and I've barely looked at it.

I finished eating half of a small tub of Hagen Daz icecream, the coconut pineapple flavor. The matcha flavor is never there,all sold out, which is sad. I used to love Japan so much it hurt. I went to Japan 4 times. the most spiritual I ever felt was in shrines in Japan and churches in Ukraine. That is magic. 

The pineapple coconut was the last one of its kind on the walmart freezer shelves. They were having a one dollar off sale. Walmart was very crowded. My mom made me talk to her friend and her friends son, who was nice(and cute), but I'm kind of avoiding people. Not particularly on purpose, it happens. If you wanna talk to me, I can't always be the one texting first. It's not my intention to force anyone to hang out with me. If someone wants to hang out they should tell me lol.

Walmart was so busy because the prices were less suffocating there compared to the grocery stores around here.

The vanilla, chocolate and strawberry flavours were all gone. The only hagen daz remaining were the weird new alcohol themed ones, like vodka limepie and rum cinnamon. The only reason I found the coconut pineapple one, where it was resting on its side, far back in the freezer was because I used to work in and with freezers. Walk in freezers, grocery glass door freezers, dairy coolers, freezer people, frozen hearts(from the point of view of empathy).

So i stood on the border of the lower door to peek beyond my normal viewing angle of the freezers contents to see the lonely pineapple icecream I finished eating today. 

All life will die, all people will leave this earth but it matters how people live. It's at times comforting and incredibly depressing thought to think of how insignificant people are too each other. 

We are like extremely spiky porcupine like creatures in a snowstorm. We need each other to survive to a certain extent, to not freeze to death, but get too close and its extremely uncomfortable and painful. Humans hate so easily. 

I am probably missing out on a lot not having a boyfriend and a couple friend groups. Of course, friends and a relationship are important, but not the most important thing for me now. Life is easier with friends and a boyfriend partner. I wish I had a bf in High School, there was more time then.

At times I am so sad when i see couples walking together. Other times I don't care. I want to fall in love.

48,"I’m going to give a TL;DR of the situation, some details I’d have to explain in private just for privacy and what not.

So, I was dating a girl for a year, before that, we were emotionally involved/talking for a year. During this time, she’d always tell me about how she wasn’t ready for a relationship and couldn’t do it at the time, it was still too painful for her following her last relationship. She ends hooked up with another guy whilst we were talking, I was of course devastated, and of course though we weren’t in a relationship we were pretty much doing everything couples do, she’d told me she loved me at this point and had even talked about kids with me. I ended up putting that behind me and continuing our situationship. It eventually grew into something much more serious. 

We started hanging out every weekend, she’d come to my flat and stay 3-4 days and I’d go to her house and spend 3-4 days, we’d alternate and did this for months. I’d even spend time at her work with her just to have more time together, this was her asking me to do this, by the way. Anyway, she cheats on me proper last April with a guy she’d told  me not to worry about. I’m of course devastated and angry and heartbroken and what not. I forgive her same day and say that I want to work things out with her. We put things behind us and are seemingly going really well, hanging out all the time and she ends up getting a tattoo about me, talking of marriage and kids. 

Few months go by, some drama transpires with a guy on reddit beginning to contact her. She gets upset blames me for everything and says she can’t trust me anymore because of it. Rich coming from a cheater, right? Anyway, we work on this. Month goes by, we go to London for a holiday. She takes my phone and sees some messages from 2017 of old girls that I’d chatted to before we began dating and becomes infuriated that I didn’t tell her about them. Again, rich coming from someone who was sleeping with another guy at the time. She starts talking about me being untrustworthy and a liar and all this rubbish. We have a pretty up and down time there. Ends on a positive note with her crying and begging for me to miss my flight to stay with her.

Fast forward a week, she breaks up with me citing trust and distance as issues. Again really rich coming from someone who broke my trust not once but twice, led me on for about a year and then even after that, still continued to be cool with the guy she had slept with. We continue to be involved emotionally for months really up until the first of January due to more drama. She tells me it’s all my fault for breaking her heart, losing her trust and respect etc. she starts dating a guy the next week and then begins telling me things like “it’s not appropriate for me to talk to you while I’m seeing him” etc. again, this coming from a cheater. 

Come to find out, she’s been going around telling her friends and family that I cheated on her, threatened to kill myself, emotionally abused her and have been sending people to harass her with nasty messages. It’s honestly so delusional that it’s funny. Essentially everything she done to me, she’s projected onto me to make herself look good.

49,"I got too hung up on the first girl who did this to me and nothing good came out of it, so we’re trying a different approach. There’s nothing left to do besides either becoming sad and depressed OR I could move on and learn from this. 

Some people just need to learn how to be a good person on their own, and I fully understand that there’s nothing I could’ve done for her to not cheat on me. I gave her everything and that apparently still wasn’t enough. 

I don’t think I’m a bad person. I feel that I did everything right by her, and I will continue to do that for the next girl and to every girl after that until I find the one. 

I will keep trying until I find someone who appreciates the things I do and someone who meets me with the same energy. 


I’m not going to beg for her back, or stalk her social media to see the other guys she’s with. Instead, I’m going to give her the freedom she decided she wants and let her life go in the direction she is taking it. 

I blocked her on everything. I kept it professional.

52,"Hey guys, sorry if I drag you down into this sea of depression I am swimming in. I think this is just something I have to get off my chest or at least try to put into words. English is my second language so I’ve never felt like a strong writer, I think I just lack the confidence. Anyways I am just going to go ham here and spew it all out. 

A little background about my life. 

My parents are from Bolivia, they came to the United States in their early 20s in hopes of a better life. They worked as on and off farmers for a wage that in all sincerity could barely sustain  a dogs basic needs. That never discouraged my sweet hardworking parents. Not even as my father worked 14 hours straight, manually picking crops under the unbearable scorching heat of the sun did he give up. Ten years later they finally had enough to invest for a small humble property over in Bolivia. My mom was thrilled as she no longer had to leave me nor my brother for months to a year at a time while she worked in the US.

My father had a pretty rough childhood. He was just a baby when his father, a liberal was decapitated by a conservative group during a violent civil war in the early 60s. Leaving my not so maternal grandmother to raise 5 kids on her own. He often begged for food and slept in the street.

My mom lost her dad to cancer when she was 15 years old, leaving my sweet beautiful celestial indigenous grandmother with 16 kids and a small farming home. 

My parents met at the age of 17. Not sure when was the first time my dad hit my mom but from what her drunken slurs spell out sometimes he was a raging alcoholic from the start. My mother eager to leave her crowded and impoverished home conditions stuck to my father who seemed like an easy way out. 

Fast forward four years later and my mother is roaming around the streets at night with my 1 year old brother seeking a place to hide from my raging alcoholic father who comes home looking for a punching bag. 

Fast forward another 10 years and my brother’s fate seems to have followed me. I remember we used to hide at my grandmothers while my dad (light skin of Spanish descend) is shouting out awful derogatory insults about my moms dark colored family. 

Around the time I turned 5, my mother began having a string of love affairs in which she would bring me along on her dates. My brother was 15 years old by then so she knew better than let him find out. He has always been very controlling and jealous of other men around my mother. To the point where even today as a 39 year old man he refuses to support my parents divorce. 

I remember having to keep my moms affairs a secret and hating her so much for it. Hating her for not having the guts to just get up and leave. Hated her for calling me a liar and accusing me of trying to ruin her life when at 7 decided to tell my father that she was dating a man. (Not like he didn’t know)

In hindsight I realize that I did that because I thought that would, for sure, put an end their crazy disturbing turbulent relationshit. Instead my father accuses me of being an evil little lying shit, yells at my mom, threatens to kill her and the next day its all swept under the rug. 

(Just an example of what my parents would do: cuss each other out, threaten to commit suicide, my dad cut my moms finger once, throw pots at each other, once my dad almost bit off my moms nose, he would take my brother as a baby while extremely intoxicated and my mom would have to go out and look for him... the list goes on..) 



Even though my father was abusive for most of my childhood/teen years I still loved him, he was handsome and intellectual and I know that he loves me to death in his own twisted fucked up view of what love is. However it was for my mom that I was growing a deep rooted resentment towards, until this day still consumes me. She has the guts to say that she did it all for me, so that I wouldn’t be without a dad. 

My toxic parents were always so wrapped around their own drama that they never cared to spend time as a family. Sure they fed me and bought me whatever I wanted. My family would often comment on what great parents I had and how spoiled I was. So I grew confused... why am I like this, so ungrateful and bitter? Since I seem to have the perfect parents. Here I am resenting these two individuals while everyone around me treats me like I am a brat. 

Fast forward and we all move together to the US. I was about 12.

My mom continued her love affairs through out my high school years and I continued to keep them “hidden” from my dad. I was such a depressed teen. By then my father had completely stopped drinking and beating on my mom. However, he was still intense, invasive, and abusive. By abusive I mean he likes to solve everything by yelling and punching the closets thing to him, he still threatens my mom but he knows better because she’s not as submissive anymore (plus in the US domestic abuse laws are much more strict) if anything the roles have switched. My mom is now the aggressive belligerent abusive drunk. 

I begged my mom to get a divorce my entire life sometimes she’d iníciate it but would never go through with it. I remember she’d come pick me up from HS to tell me she was speaking to a lawyer only to have my hopes deflated a week later. 

After my grandmother died my mothers drinking increased. (She’s also the only one out of 13 who were able to get their shit together, so she has been financially supporting her ENTIRE family in Bolivia practically all her life). 

She’d get so drunk and then cuss me out if I asked her to please stop. By cuss I mean seriously nasty shit btw, I thought most moms talked to their kids like that until I began making friends and realized how awful the things my parents said to me were. She claims she doesn’t have a drinking problem, I’m the one with the problem. I’ve given up on her drinking because I honestly can’t continue to fight her, it’s gotten to the point where we just can’t see eye to eye on anything. Again don’t get me wrong I do love my mom. She’s great to me, she’d do anything for me as long as it’s not related to her having to change her behavior/ habits. 

As a teen I started to really feel disgusted by my father and his pathetic tantrums. I’d tell him he was a coward and a loser for not having the pants to divorce my mother. It would usually end in him punching my arm or pulling my hair but there was so much rage in me with no outlet.

In high school I was embarrassed to bring friends home as my parents were ALWAYS fighting. Cops were constantly coming over the house. Neighbors were always complaining. It was embarrassing. I was such a depressed teen.

It didn’t help that my older brother  as well as my parents are still until this day in complete denial. My mom is with my father now purely out of practicality and because she says what’s the point now? They live together in that same tiny shitty apartment where I never had my own room, (shared with mom, dad slept in living room) still hate each other but things are not nearly as bad as they were before but still dysfunctional and chaotic.

I feel like I never had the warmth of a real family and I know I’m too old to be nagging about this but it still hurts. Everything hurts. It hurts that my brother the only person who can testify for what we lived through says that nothing ever happened. That everything is great. That I am dramatic, annoying, and I need to worry about myself because I’m a loser, that I need a better paying job...

I hate that my brother would instill fear in my mom. He’s a total mommas boy and I know my mom must of thought she’d lose him forever if she tried to get a divorce. (He asked her several times not to, he didn’t live w us so what did he care) About a year ago I had my first and real conversation with him over our family dynamic and how it isn’t too late for my mom to be happy, for my dad to be happy, for us to live a true and authentic life without all the secrets, drama and bullshit. My brother got FURIOUS, confronted and asked me why I’d want such thing? Why would do I hate dad so much? What is wrong with me? Do you want mom whoring around? 

I was so disappointed, so out of breath, so tired of fighting this.  

I should mention... when I was a kid and my parents were away working in the US my cousins husband sexually molested me. I was 14 when I woke up and my pants were down. He said “don’t worry your parents asked me to check this out” as he performed oral on me. Thankfully his wife called him so he couldn’t hurt me further. The next morning I was terrified,  I told my parents, they were furious, nothing is ever pursued legally, and the rest is a blur for me. They sort of just let it go, no one talked about it, but I sure as hell did think about it.

I moved away as soon as I turned 22 across the country because a couple of states over wasn’t far enough. The distance I needed to put between me &amp; my family’s mind fucking games was immeasurable. 

Maybe it’s because I never had my own room to scape to but I just always felt in the middle of an earthquake in a war zone after a fire. I remember my dad woke me up at 3am the night of my S.A.T’s just to  make a ridiculous scene about my mom not being home accusing me of knowing where she was. Unfortunately this wasn’t the first time he pulled this shit, it was the norm. 

I should add that my dad is a workaholic he thinks about money a lot, he doesn’t have a great paying job but it’s sufficient. My father never took me on trips, we never went to the theater, never took off for birthdays, graduations, vacations, nope nothing not even sick does he call out. He’s in constant fear of being fired from his long term job. For him money is the end game. Which is sad he never lived nor did he enjoy his life because all he cared about was not losing a dime. He’s not cheap with me but he def doesn’t give a shit about himself. I guess it will be worth it to him when he retires? 

I don’t want to sound ungrateful, financially my parents have always been there for me. College books, car, rent money, clothes, doctors.... but I just really wish that we didn’t live such a phony life. 

To think that I work with abused children but yet I can’t seem to decipher my own childhood trauma, why do I let it effect me so much? How do I let go of this anger? I feel so stupid because I know this was a long time ago but they often make remarks about how happy everything was which is so not true. Not for me!  

I’m going back for my Masters and might have to move back in with my parents. Which is why I need better coping strategies, I desperately want to get my MSW but because it is an accelerated program I won’t be able to continue working. 


Anyways sorry whoever actually read this long boring story, I know I’m all over the place but thank you for taking the time. This felt good.

56,"For all of my life I ve been a ""definitely not"" calm person. I am either extremely excited, extremely anxious, extremely impatient etc.

I really want to be a calmer person since I can see my "" not calm "" beings effects on my mental health. I start overthinking, become angry, frustrated etc. ( I have depression but I dont want to use drugs so I am trying more psychological tricks however it makes everything harder ) However during a trigger if I can understand it triggers me I sometimes can decrease the effects, I am not rushing with my thought and even though I should be for ex. extremely angry, I make myself feel calm and remove that feeling. And I enjoy being calm so much because at that time I feel that I can see everything from a wider perspective rather than my own personal view and my anger just replaces itself with another feeling.

I want to be in this calm mindset more and try to calm down even more frequent when I am facing triggers. Do you have any suggestions for me? ( Apart from meditation? I am trying still ^^ )",12Feb2019,1
57,"My late aunt (RIP) once told me ""You are the typical ADHD child"".

I don't know if that's true - but I've always had trouble focusing on a single task at hand. Most times, and that I am grateful for, I can accomplish things pretty well if I have the patience and will to sit down and not get distracted by other things. 

In my teens and early 20s I would often not know what to do with my time. Now I sometimes feel like that I wasted too much of it doing meaningless stuff, like playing video games or going out partying. But I guess different people develop at different paces and so I was rather on the slow side. The youngest child of three and as a male I assume that's more often the rule than an exception. 

All of this to say: I often drift away in my thoughts. Then I remember after twenty minutes what I actually wanted to check online. Forget why I came into a room in the first place because something in the very same room manages to distract my concentration. 

I am often flimsy like that. And so my thoughts dart around from one idea to the next and from one interest of mine to the other. So when I see a post on r/politics, I first check out the gal who the article is about on Wikipedia, then check her personal history, what school she went to. Start reading about who else went to this school. Why a certain library is named after what person. Who that person was. What kind of programs they have that might be of interest to me, even though I live in Europe these days. What specific programs cost that do interest me. 

Until I finally, after about an hour, pull the plug and tell myself ""OP, this is ridiculous, you're not moving to \[insert city in the US\] just to get a degree, you don't even need a degree, you're doing well at your current job..""

That's just an example of how my thoughts run throughout the day sometimes. And I am sure I am not alone with that.

And sometimes my thoughts go into the weirdest direction. Like checking out other guys who I think dress well. Or guys or are built well. Even though I know I am not attracted to men. But then I still end up wondering why I don't look like that. How they live and what love life they might have.

And then I start belittling myself or wondering why I am even thining about that. What does it mean and why did I just start that thought? What was the trigger and how can I learn from that trigger about my own psyche? And what do those insights tell me about my character or what I should be doing in my life? Am I doing the right things right now or should I live differently? Somewhere else entirely? As somebody else entirely?

Thoughts like this have struck me on numerous occasions. Probably caused by my predisposition to overanalyze situations and people's behaviours and be overly critical towards myself. 

I am aware of that. But I still never told anybody. 

I thought it made me special or that other people probably never have such thoughts. I thought myself a fraud for having such thoughts and not acting on them. I thought I wasn't truly being myself. An imposter.

Until I told my wife. 

She is my rock. She can always calm me down and make me feel welcome and at home. I love her very, very much.

And she told me that it's normal to have such thoughts. That it's normal that humans' brains are sometimes looking for explanations even though there aren't any. That everybody has crazy thoughts sometimes and ""good people"" recognize them as such and learn to deal with them, while ""bad people"" might start acting on them.

And it was such a relief for me to hear this. To know I am not special in any kind of way and that it doesn't make me crazy to think like this. I know it sounds childish to read (and write) this now, but it's true. I have kept this from other people for so long that I could not imagine it being of such little importance. Or just 'normal'.

I feel so much better about myself that I now, with some distance, just realize how many triggers and thought structures I have in my everyday life that I created that stem from this misbelief. It's hard to be confronted with it and let this go at times. But I also know that I am on the right track with confronting myself. That eventually I will be able to let this go entirely.

But, most importantly, I finally feel like I can be myself again. And that I can discard all these feelings of inappropriateness and insecurity. That I am just me and nothing is wrong with what's going on in my head.

So this post is just a clarification for myself. I letter I needed to write to somebody. My way to work myself out of these old thought structures. 

Thank you for reading - and thanks to my beautiful wife for helping me let go of this. ",12Feb2019,1

Quick background. I’m a 25 year old male. She is also 25. We have a stupid close group of friends from college and we all still live close together and hang out all the time. We became good friends because when we all first started college and hanging out, I was together with her roommate and she was with mine so we just all became close, things didn’t work out between all that but we all stayed friends and it was cool. Over the years we’ve both dated other people and she was just like a little sister to me. Really never saw her any differently, even though other people always thought we were dating. We always gravitate towards each other when we’re together. I’ve been on vacation with her family, my family loves her etc etc. We’re very close, you get the point.

Skip to last Year and two of our best friends got married and we were both in the wedding parties. The groom was drunk and told me how awesome it would be if me and my friend got together and was planting ideas in my head. No big deal though I’ve been hearing this for years. 
Basically it worked and since then I’ve been slowly falling in love with her and realize that I think I always have been, but have just been waiting for our clocks to match up. And I think the time is now before someone else snatches her up, (she has been single for about a year now).

This is my unique situation which is why I had to create a throwaway, please bare with me. I have been with my fair share of women and talking with her, I know she loves sex and she’s a very pretty girl and has a good amount of it. I have been with my fair share of women, but have not been able to maintain a relationship because, well....I don’t have the biggest penis. It is below average and I know girls don’t like it. This isn’t a pity party, I’ve gone through a lot of self acceptance and it’s fine, it is what it is, nothing I can do about it, but what I’m afraid of is that she actually feels the same way towards me and when we finally go to have sex, she will be disappointed, not want to date someone with a small penis no matter how close we are and our friendship will be ruined. I really can’t talk to anyone about this which is why I’m turning to you beautiful strangers for advice. If it’s true love will it not matter? Is it worth risking our friendship? For all I know she doesn’t even feel the same way and I’ll make a fool of myself before even getting in bed with her. 

I’m thinking about sending her flowers for Valentine’s Day and maybe asking her out on a date as a friend thing but I don’t know, I’m at a loss. I haven’t felt like this before haha. Ughhh please help me. ",12Feb2019,1

67,"Long story short I had my heart broken by a best-friend-turned-romantic situation with someone I considered the closest friend I’d ever had. The breakup wasn’t anyone’s fault in any logical sense but I was devastated. 

Now, we’re out of contact, on opposite sides of the planet (actually) and yet I still compulsively pore over every little moment of the relationship, stabbing myself with heartache every time my mind inevitably wanders back to the good and the bad. It’s gotten to the point where I prefer to have a video/audiobook/tv show/music in the background whenever I’m not concentrating on some specific task like reading or studying. I can’t ever seem to escape my own almost-addictive behaviour. Every time I go back, the food in my mouth turns to dust, the beauty in front of me turns into emptiness, my joy turns into a longing for something I know I will never have. 

How do I move on? How do I stop bringing myself back to the trauma every spare moment I get? How do I fucking stop hurting myself? ",12Feb2019,1
68,"I originally posted this onto /r/socialskills but didn't get a reply whatsoever. I found this subreddit and thought I might as well try here.

So I'm currently attending a web development bootcamp to start a career in the web dev industry. Part of this bootcamp is creating a final project, and then presenting it talent recruiters from local companies.

A couple of weeks ago, the class before mine just had their final project demo day. We had class tonight and were highly encouraged to check out the demo day to see what it's like and find inspiration for our own finals.

I tried to attend the program. Problem is, I have social anxiety and have been dealing with it for a while. I thought I had it under control for the most part - until that night. When I came to the event, my anxiety immediately washed over me, and all I could do was fast walk through the presentation space and make a beeline for the bathroom. After that, I stepped outside in the freezing cold and sat at a bench feeling frustrated, upset, and embarrassed at my cowardice.

After I thought I calmed down, I tried to go again, but as soon as I saw the crowd, I just couldn't do it. And it was so frustrating.

Now I'm starting to feel really afraid. Afraid that I'll be too anxious to participate in MY demo day. How could I if I couldn't even attend another class's demo day? Hell, I was probably more nervous than the people actually giving their presentations.

So I've come here for some guidance. My demo day isn't until April, so I do have time to mentally prepare for the event. But I'm already worried about it now when I should be thinking about what the actual project should be.

With all that said, what can I do to make sure I don't feel so anxious that I'll have an anxiety attack or (god forbid) a panic attack when I do my own project demonstration? Has anyone had this happen in the past and found a way to get past it? Should I talk to my instructor or a TA or my ""Student Success Manager"" (basically a guidance counselor) about it?

TLDR: I had an anxiety attack during a project demonstration event for a career field I want to pursue and need advice on how not to have one when it's my turn.",12Feb2019,1
69,"21 years old. My last relationship was horrible and I vowed to sorta just not date anymore. However, I keep searching for love or whatever. I’m not depressed about it but it’s quite annoying that I long for a woman to take care of. To nurture. And to also have very passionate sex with, almost as if we are communicating with our bodies. I just want to be cool with the fact that maybe there is no “one” for me and just keep it going. And I’ll do that, until I see some woman I’m very attracted to and interested in, followed by me pursuing her, or at least attempting to. 

I have this feeling in my chest, but it feels like it’s filled with emotions not physical pain. It’s towards the most current woman I showed my interest in, via valentines gifts and just overall conversation. We got pretty drunk and high one night and she said things to me that one would think shows her interest in me but I’m guessing once she got sober she kinda realized she made a mistake or something. That’s cool, but I wonder, what is it about me that makes her not want to say the things she said to me while high/intoxicated while sober? 

I get all into my head and start examining my flaws. I compare myself to other men and feel like a weakling. Maybe I’m not ready for a woman. Maybe I’m still a boy but at the legal age of a “man”. What’s it like to even be a “man”? What’s the point of me even wanting to find a partner? Why am I thinking about this everyday?

73,"This is the most ridiculous post ove ever written.

What happened is that the guy wanted to stay with me,because he liked me,but because he recently left a long relationship he didnt want to start a new one with me.(At this point we've been going out 4 months,and i thought we were already in a relationship so when he told me this i was really shocked)

He wanted us to go on dates,hold hands,all the things a couple would do,but also be free to go out with other people. 

We have to tell eachother everything that happened on those dates,and if we had sex with someone else we would brake it off,because he isnt comfortable with me sleeping with other people.

I wasnt into the idea,because i really like him and im only human,i dont want to share.
Hes going to meet up with a girl in a week that he was talking secretly behind my back. I feel betrayed.

Im meeting a friend tomorrow,and i told him about it. I think he understood it as me going on a date,and he acted really weird over texts. I think that me going out with someone is actually bothering him,and he wanted to be the only one to actually experience the open relationship,and for me to stay monogamous,but he didnt want to sound even more like an asshole and say it out loud.

We arent in the same town right now,and thats the only reason we are still together. I want to break it off when we see eachother next time. I want to see his face when i tell him that its over. Want to see if he'll actually care.

I feel underappreciated,used and overall shitty. 
Im not sure why i want him to still like me. We get along splendidly,or,we did,before this. So maybe thats the reason.
I want to be in a relationship with him still,but i respect myself enough to not settle for something im not comfortable with. And the fact that this didnt turn me off enough to run is scaring me.
So my question here is-how do i get over him? We said that we'll stay friends but i don't know if thats a smart decision,at least until im over him.

75,"Hi Gang,

I am actually in the process of heartbreak from my exSO who I was planning on marrying. Its been hard but my gut was screaming at me that the relationship was unhealthy. I wanted to list some of the red flags here and see if, give your understanding of the challenges of marriage and children, that I chose not to take the relationship further or work on it any longer.

I am hoping that asking people who are mostly in healthy relationships I will get a bit of validation that I made the right decision. We were thinking of getting married in the next two years and starting to have children at three.

I should add that outside of these negatives, she was a loving, caring and very kind girlfriend and we were very much in Love.

\- She hit me once, while drunk, as I came home late and she was locked out for 25mins on a dangerous road. She justified this by saying she was scared and locked out. Also it's not the same as if gender roles were reversed. She showed remorse but also seemed to forget this evening happened a year or so later. Making me even deny the events myself.

\- Very OCD about cleanliness in the home. It's a stressor for her. Refuses to get a regular cleaner to help with this and buy us more time to do fun stuff (We could have afforded it comfortably)

\- Cannot take criticism 90% of the time. Gets very worked up and defensive if you try and pass on a criticism, even in a calm manner.

\- Prefers all natural health care to an extent that she has not seen a doctor for 28 years, refuses a smear test and claims that she would always do her own research to decide if she would use a natural or 'mainstream' approach to health. She is not a medical professional in any capacity.

\- Has not been vaccinated.

\- Future MIL is very controlling of her. She is a natural health provider and assists on her helping her around the house with chores (she lives very close) future MIL had a health condition that could be easily treated but again refuses any modern healthcare through the threat of death.

\- She refused any couples counseling, had tried CBT to help with mood swings but refused anyone on one therapy.

\- Often is the victim and rarely has the insight into how destructive her behaviors can be.

\- Has made thinly veiled suicide threats, One more serious that I prevented. Her trigger claimed to be tiredness and me saying 'stop joking about that..' and showing me she meant it.

\- Much of the above has been discussed with her but met with defensiveness and often turning it around to be a bi-product of my behavior. e.g. ""i got angry as you were not listening""

\- Took a very strong dislike to one of my female friends (who made no effort with her and can be a bit rude) to the point where it was once stated ""I can't be with you if you are friends with her""

\- Has a brother who shows lots of bipolar traits, suicide threats and long mood swings.

\- Sister has emigrated with her own family due to the volatility of this one and behavior that got out of hand once she started having her own children. She has gone total no contact.

\- Father has previously been physically abused but seems to be tamer now.

So, I chose to leave and not propose to this woman in the next 6 months, did I make the right call? Should I have tried to work on these issues? I feel it is a way to far gone and an unhealthy place to raise a family. I feel I have abandoned her and the relationship, she is devastated but I think these are not issues I can fix, especially if trying to get to address some of them is a very difficult task.

To be clear she has shown no real intention of extracting herself from toxic family members. Sometimes they are stable but this is what I have observed over the BU.

I did try and discuss these things during separation but was met with yo-yo-ing of empty promises to seek help and throwing the blame back at me, suggestions that I am meant to accept this situation as a healthy one to start a family in.

&amp;#x200B;

But I've also known a girl here for the last three years, and lately all I can think of is how bad it's going to be moving away from her. I'm pretty introverted at heart but I became really good friends with her. We've been through hell together. She suffered from some pretty severe depression and I've seen her at her worst (she attempted suicide several times, and I've said goodbye to her more than a few times not expecting to see her alive in the morning). Likewise, she's seen me at my worst when I'm riddled with anxiety and cant' stop worrying over something trivial, and helped comfort me through some of my worst mistakes. I feel like she's the only person I've ever trusted or been myself with, and we just seem to get along most of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got a job offer in another state and she wants to continue schooling, so there's almost no chance that we will be near each other after graduation. I think I finally came to the realization that I love her, and I don't know what to do. I don't think things would work out if I told her. In the beginning of our relationship I was distant and kind of an ass and I knew she loved me at the time but I wasn't sure what love was or if I felt it back and brushed her off. Somehow we still remained friends, but she told me straight up that she couldn't afford to care about me as much as she did before because I hurt her emotionally. That's fair - I honestly deserved it based on how I treated her.

I don't know. I don't have much to say, and I'm just tearfully rambling at my keyboard now.

86,"I’m going to give a TL;DR of the situation, some details I’d have to explain in private just for privacy and what not.

So, I was dating a girl for a year, before that, we were emotionally involved/talking for a year. During this time, she’d always tell me about how she wasn’t ready for a relationship and couldn’t do it at the time, it was still too painful for her following her last relationship. She ends hooked up with another guy whilst we were talking, I was of course devastated, and of course though we weren’t in a relationship we were pretty much doing everything couples do, she’d told me she loved me at this point and had even talked about kids with me. I ended up putting that behind me and continuing our situationship. It eventually grew into something much more serious. 

We started hanging out every weekend, she’d come to my flat and stay 3-4 days and I’d go to her house and spend 3-4 days, we’d alternate and did this for months. I’d even spend time at her work with her just to have more time together, this was her asking me to do this, by the way. Anyway, she cheats on me proper last April with a guy she’d told  me not to worry about. I’m of course devastated and angry and heartbroken and what not. I forgive her same day and say that I want to work things out with her. We put things behind us and are seemingly going really well, hanging out all the time and she ends up getting a tattoo about me, talking of marriage and kids. 

Few months go by, some drama transpires with a guy on reddit beginning to contact her. She gets upset blames me for everything and says she can’t trust me anymore because of it. Rich coming from a cheater, right? Anyway, we work on this. Month goes by, we go to London for a holiday. She takes my phone and sees some messages from 2017 of old girls that I’d chatted to before we began dating and becomes infuriated that I didn’t tell her about them. Again, rich coming from someone who was sleeping with another guy at the time. She starts talking about me being untrustworthy and a liar and all this rubbish. We have a pretty up and down time there. Ends on a positive note with her crying and begging for me to miss my flight to stay with her.

Fast forward a week, she breaks up with me citing trust and distance as issues. Again really rich coming from someone who broke my trust not once but twice, led me on for about a year and then even after that, still continued to be cool with the guy she had slept with. We continue to be involved emotionally for months really up until the first of January due to more drama. She tells me it’s all my fault for breaking her heart, losing her trust and respect etc. she starts dating a guy the next week and then begins telling me things like “it’s not appropriate for me to talk to you while I’m seeing him” etc. again, this coming from a cheater. 

Come to find out, she’s been going around telling her friends and family that I cheated on her, threatened to kill myself, emotionally abused her and have been sending people to harass her with nasty messages. It’s honestly so delusional that it’s funny. Essentially everything she done to me, she’s projected onto me to make herself look good.

I despise econ so much. I have 46% and I have absolutely 0 motivation to study and got a 40% on my first test because I don’t care about it (obviously because I didn’t study).  

The problem is I’m taking 15 credits now and when I drop it I’ll be down to 11, and I need 12 to be considered a “full time student.” On top of that, my parents are paying $50k a year to send me here so I obviously feel really shitty about taking 11 credits and taking the W. 

And honestly, I’ve never been good in school. I would consider myself a “B” student. I occasionally get a C, but it’s mainly B’s with an A or two. I just don’t CARE about school and grades. I know I can be successful in the real world without getting good grades. No one gives a fuck about college grades past your first job. So, it’s almost in my subconscious not to try and not to fully care about grades because I know they truly don’t care. 

I have an amazing work ethic for things I love and want to learn. I love to learn... about things that interest me. I will constantly watch documentaries about the mind and psychology instead of studying or doing homework. I love how and why people think.  If I don’t care about something, I don’t put effort into it. I just don’t care. Plain and simple.

I really want to start my own company and just DO it. I understand I have to learn the basics, but some classes just don’t help me towards my goals. 

If it’s not helping me to my goals, it’s utterly useless to me and I don’t care about it. I will probably have an interest in econ later in life, but for now, I can’t do it. I get the basics of it, but the tests and all this shit is so boring. It’s marcoecon btw. ",12Feb2019,1

Medications: Predisolone/ACTH/Vigabatrin/Onfi/Phenytoin/Phenobarbital/ Toppamax/Benzal/Vimpat /Keppra. Handles every side effect like a god damn warrior, but Nothing has ever given her the control she needs   


She's had 3 total brain operations.  


at 7 months old she had  her 1st surgery which removed her entire malformed temporal lobe and some parietal which finally gave her seizure freedom, we were estastic only for it to come crashing down 6 months later with atrophy to the hippocampus and atonic seizure (clustering daily)Meds did nothing   


at 16 months old she had her 2nd set of operations were an SEEG and Ablation of the hippocampus. Her seizure freedom only lasted 1 month and now she is having focal onset simple partial seizures. VEEG shows activity in the same area. Where the temporal,  parietal, occitipal lobes meet.  Currently only Benzal/onfi/keppra and just add vimpat, which has shown to weaken the seizure but they increase in number daily, have not finished titration, trying sooo hard to remain hopeful.   


Our neuro team does not want additional imaging done until she is 24 months old. (6months to go) they claim that brain will be clearer then for imaging. 6 months of these daily seizures terrifies me. they also told us an occipital lobe disconnect is most likely in our future. which means  complete homonymous hemianopia. ( complete loss of vision on one side for both eyes)  


My feel like my sanity is slipping. NOTHING, we have done has given her freedom, countless days spent in hospital hooked up to machines, her cries of terror when she sees anyone in medical scrubs after her second surgery. all these medicines messing with her head for what? and now you tell my daughter will need a 3RD surgery? will loss have her vision!? My mind literally can't comprehend it. I'm destroying my daughter

I just really really want to be loved and I really really want to love in a romantic way. I want all the cuddling, the laughs, the random surprises, compliments and sex both of us can give to each other.

I'm only 15 but I don't think I'm too young for all of that. I feel pretty ready for that kind of responsibility tbh. 

But I know I'll have too wait for the right person, the right  time, a good mental health and the right opportunity. Because even though I'm desperate for love I don't want to ruin it for both of us.",12Feb2019,1

96,"This isn’t typical in my experience (this will be my 7th surgery in the last 9 years).  Usually they only give an estimate of how much the procedure MAY cost, but never have I been asked to make a payment days prior to being sliced and diced. ",12Feb2019,1
97,"My kids are 4 and 2.5. We got into a big fight two days ago while I was at work. When I got off work I was checking notifications on my phone and saw a recording from my nest Front Door camera, my wife was getting out kids ready to meet me at the Tax Office and the door camera heard the audio.

My son wasn't listening so my wife told him ""Come on $son or daddy is going to yell at me. Do you want daddy to yell at me?""

To my son. My 2.5 year old son. I'm pissed, I'm heart broken, I don't know what to do. How long has she been shit talking me to the kids? What else has she said to the kids like that? What do the kids think about me now? What poison has she filled their heads with about me?

I don't know what to do. ",12Feb2019,1
98,"So I've been thinking about contacting my ex best friend for the past few days. 

We had been friends for years, before we stopped talking. We text and call every day, before she basically slowly ghosted me out of her life.
I have no idea why this happened, she never gave me a reason and we never talked about it. She just started distancing herself and not responding to my messages or calls anymore. And I was furious with her. I tried to ask her what was going on multiple times but she just said she was busy and then stopped responding altogether.

I was so angry and hurt that she could so easily cut me out that I stopped making any effort talking to her, and then suddenly we hadn't talked for a few years.

But I miss her. I had vowed not to speak to her again after she cut me out but there's a lot of things that have happened in both our lives, and I feel like it's gonna be no time till we're middle aged and I'll barely remember her

I'm still in two minds about making any kind of contact with her again, because I think if she were to ghost me or not reply if just feel more anger and resentment. 

Anyone have any opinions? Is it worth it?",12Feb2019,1
99,"Around 8 months ago I found out I had an incurable yet somewhat controllable disease at stage 3 that has left me in great pain most days meaning I had to quit my job as a trainee nurse and claim for disability benefits. Since then I’ve been in my moms care at her home along with my partner working super hard to help us get along. My job was something I was proud of and something I knew for one that I was great at, it was my baby. But now it’s over for me and I feel like I’ve lost what I was known for, my self worth and all the other great things that came with being in a reputable job. I’m worried that my family think I’m a failure and that they’re now embarrassed of me not being what I used to be. Is there anyway I can rediscover myself to help my situation? Is there anyway I can make my loved ones proud of me again",12Feb2019,1
101,"Two years ago, I moved out of my parents' house without their knowledge or permission. I went overseas for school and upon landing, I took a taxi and never went home. So Feb. 1st, I found my first apartment. That same week, I got my first official job! Shitty supermarket job, but it was in the bakery so little to no interaction. But as time went by, my mood got worse and worse at work, to the point where I would spend many hours of my shift hiding and crying in the freezers. 

My shifts were either from noon to 9:00 or 9:30, or from 7am to about 4pm. I was really lucky to be working full-time in a grocery store, but the job was so not for helping my mood. So I would get home at 10 or 11pm, after taking the longest bus route possible (I love taking the bus and would purposely avoid the metro). I would then call a pizza place, order the same thing every night. 10 breaded chicken wings, one panzerotti, one iced tea bottle. And I would watch The Price is Right. Every night for weeks. At some point, the wifi in my apartment stopped working. The landlord did nothing about it. So, I would get wifi from the floor under me (passwords were the same) and download The Price is Right episodes, and just watch those while eating, and before going to bed.

And I miss that. And I wanted to say this somewhere. I'm feeling a little sad today and the power went out for a couple of seconds. I am thinking of downloading things in case it goes out for long (snowstorm outside) and I remember the struggle of sitting on the stairs of my apartment complex without being noticed, to download 3 or so episodes of a show I don't really care for every evening, so I could calm down before bed.

103,"My dad is an alpha male. My dad has a brother, who is also an alpha male. My brother and I are not. He made sure I knew he was disappointed in me. He was harder on me and always tried to make me “tough”.  I’m not soft, I’ve been in fights. I stand up for myself and those I care about. But I never fit his definition of a man. When I came out as bisexual he distanced himself.  But I called him.  All my unsaid feelings and anger came out. He realized he’d fucked up.  He apologized. He’s genuinely been trying to change. 

I still feel like having feelings is wrong, still. Recently he and I were on the phone and I was telling him about fiancé, who happens to be a woman. He asked about how I chose her. I explained that she respected my boundaries.  I recalled a time when a girl and I were on a date. She kept tickling me and calling me a nickname I don’t like.   So I stopped dealing with her. I’ve had situations like this with a few of the people I’ve dated and I always cut it off.  I expected him to call me sensitive or soft. But....he didn’t...he agreed and said I had good decision making skills. I know it’s small but I’m so excited about this! ",12Feb2019,1
105,"My grandfather was a narcissist who was abusive to my dad, grandma, siblings and I. Everyone.

My grandfather locked me in the closet after I told him that he can get the remote control himself. The remote control was right there next to him. I got a half assed apology from him. 

He yelled at me for accidentally knocking over my glass of juice at dinner. He locked me in the garage for the night for talking back to him. A few days prior, he yelled at me for telling him to leave me alone that he threatened to hit me. 

He called my dad (his own son) stupid at my high school graduation party. Not for the hundredth time. 

More things happened but I spend so much time trying to forget about it that I suppress it. 

My wife tells me that I shouldn’t hold any grudges against my grandfather and that I should just forgive him. I understand, but how am I going to forgive him for the abuse he put my cousins, siblings and I through?

How can I forgive him without excusing the abuse he’s put me through.
