0,"I'm 27 and my girlfriend is 29. We've been together for 4 years and we've been living together for 3 years.

Today I don't feel well. It all started yesterday and I basically got a bad flu. I'm coughing every couple of minutes and my throat hurts so much. I even feel pain in my ribs when I cough. Hopefully in a couple of days I'll start feeling better.

My girlfriend went out in the evening with a friend and I'm still alone at home, feeling like shit because of this bad flu.

I feel like I've lost my own identity. I'm waiting for her to come back and sometimes I don't even know how to enjoy myself. This doesn't seems right. I'm in a situation where my own identity depends on the other person and I have trouble at being happy by staying with myself.

There are people that thinks they need to spend more time with other people. I'm at a point where I'm really starting to think that I really need to spend more time alone. I want to enjoy myself when I'm with her, when I'm with other people and also when I'm alone.

I want to have things to do. I want to concentrate myself on some passions of mine and get excited about that. I want to be so excited about life that even if I'm alone I've so many things to get excited about and endless possibilities in front of me.

I'm scared that I can't be enough for myself and I want to change that.",11Jan2019,1
1,"Hi! So a little backstory so you can have an idea on what I'm talking about. I'm 18 y old,my parents are divorce(they divorced when i was 5) and I'm curently living with my mom. I m the oldest child ( i have 2 siblings) and since i was little my mom would abuse me not only physically but also mentally. She would always tell me how worthless I am, that I'm a disgrace to this family and that she doesn't stand me anymore. She s also an alcoholic and when she's drunk that's when she starts to get really aggressive,sayings things that should not be said to your own child. Till this day I'm thinking WTF I'm doing wrong: i don t really go out, I usually stay at home and study because I want to go to med school this year and always doing, I help around the house etc. I'm not saying that I'm perfect but it seems that everything I do is fucking wrong because she's always judging me. Please help me because i really don't know what to do, I fell like i finally reached my limit and I'm scared to talk to her because idk what to say...

2,"When people talk about gay rights, they love to talk about how it's not a choice, and they love to focus on the difficulties gays face. They always mention that being gay is just about love, and we're not any different from anyone else. I get why people talk like this, but the truth is, I love being a lesbian. It is a huge part of my identity and personality, and I think it's shaped my life in wonderful ways.

Younger years sucked, it's true. I was awkward, bullied a little bit, and didn't fit in. So instead, I spent my time buried in books. Would I have ever found my love of reading and writing had I fit in better and were I not constantly seeking some kind of communion I could not find with my peers? I doubt it. My introverted escapism led me to finding my passion, as well as getting into an elite college. 

Now in my 30s, I see a lot of my straight friends having trouble keeping and making new friends. A lot of them, especially guy friends, have girlfriends that don't want them to have any female friends because of jealousy. It sometimes goes vice-versa. I'm usually the exception because, as a lesbian, I ""don't count"". A lot of them seem lonely and I feel bad for them. I often don't see them as much, and I miss them a lot, too. 

There is a gay lifestyle, and it's not just about who you want to bang. Of my 7 exes, I'm still very close friends with 3 of them, friendly terms with two more, and the other two I've drifted apart from. This isn't weird in the gay community, in fact, it's pretty normal amongst people I know. My girlfriend has met several of my exes. I've met several of hers. We've stayed in one of my ex's bedrooms while traveling, and jealousy or weird feelings on either side haven't been an issue. I've had casual sex with quite a few of my friends at different points. This has not made things awkward between any of us. None of us accuse each other of ""friendzoning"". I get invited to elaborate theme parties almost every month, as well as the occasional orgy, in spite of the fact that I'm cute but not really conventionally hot. It feels like a lifestyle I never even could have imagined in my wildest dreams as a lonely, desperate, extremely virginal teen.

I just wanted to share that I feel really lucky to be gay. I know this isn't the experience of all gay people. I also know there are many straight people lead much wilder and more interesting lives than me. I'm not trying to brag or show off, I just, I feel like this is a side of the story people don't talk about as often. There are so many depressing stories covered about hate crimes and discrimination, but that's not the whole story. There's also communities all over the world of people that love each other deeply and band together to make existing just a little more magical, and almost every day I find myself thinking, ""thank fucking god I'm gay"".",11Jan2019,1

6,"Lately my life has been work. 60 hours a week between two jobs. I’ve decided to change all that and am down to one job in a few weeks and moving cities where there’s more opportunity for career growth.

Outside of work I’m struggling to find my interests. I like to think I enjoy the outdoors, cooking, the idea of meal prepping, being active, going for drinks with friends, being social, going on vacation, getting dressed up all fancy, doing my hair and makeup, going on dates, you name it. But lately I’ve felt so blah.

I’ve been off for the past 3 days and all I’ve done has been sleep in, clean my room, watch YouTube videos and eat some food. I did catch up with an old friend though. And in regards to moving, I have a vacation planned with my parents before I move to go on a cruise. After the cruise I’m in the same city for 2 weeks. I’ve been looking into going on a solo trip to go skiing or overseas to visit my sister but even thinking about it doesn’t excite me to much. What’s up with all that?

8,"I’m 21 years old and I thought, like many young people, that I was invincible health-wise. I am a healthy weight and physically active. I’m also a college student with a pizza addiction.

 “I work out so I can’t be unhealthy” 

“cholesterol? Triglycerides? I won’t have to worry about that until I’m 40”

10,"So atm I have a phase again where I do not think. I've had this before it always seems to reaccure. My days consist of waking up at noon, eating something, playing video games somewhere in between eat again and then go to sleep. It makes me think I am okay.

I feel bad for not thinking, I don't feel I deserve having no problems. It does not feel right. I also know I want to do other stuff like program and exercise but I can't seem to get up for that shit. Kind of hate myself but not that much. Idk really where this is going. My sleep schedule is also fucked. School starts on monday again and I feel like when it does my life will be shit again. Ha. More like I will feel shit again. What am I even doing. This is the most thinking I have done in a while now. Feel like this state lasted for so long. Many months. Kind of feel like my ex made me into a horrible human being. Didn't have much contact with my friends whilst being with her. I hate her. For what she did to me. Just why. And then putting herself in a position as where she is the victim. FUCK YOU.

Watching them self destruct and tear themselves apart because they dont know how to handle specific stressors in life is difficult. Wanting to be their saving grace to only be shut down is difficult. Watching her drink and smoke her life and career away is difficult knowing she is a better person with a beautiful heart and soul. Sitting here slightly drunk bitching to you all is difficult. Wanting the absolute best and trying to keep yourself together for her sake and your sake is difficult. Dealing with your moms cancer being back is difficult. Dealing with your 19 year old brother not working and living in your house is difficult. Kicking his ass out today was difficult. Trying to be the best father possible and get custody of your son is difficult. Being in the Army and LE both at the same time is difficult. Not knowing how to turn off my heart is difficult.

I feel like some of the few things that make my life pleasurable I’m also addicted to. I stay on the internet so much that I can’t sleep at night. I drink soda whenever I go to school in the mornings from the vending machines and I often feel terrible because of the high blood sugar levels because I forget to eat breakfast because I’m also too focused on browsing the Internet and listening to music in the mornings. I also have a massive craving to eat nothing but shitty foods that are going to cause me to die of diabetes or heart disease later in life but I can’t stand to eat vegetables. I feel like killing myself right now because I’m tired of living like this  but I’m not going to because I’m too scared of death and whether it would be painful or not.

28,"Hey guys and gals, 

I'm just writing some stuff down here because I have nobody else that I can talk to in real life. I'm not really sure what I am expecting in reply, just venting basically. 

I recently moved across the country with my bestfriend and girlfriend to a new city after graduating from college last May. It was a huge change but I have been travelling far from home since I was 15 so I didn't think that would be a problem. At first it really wasn't, we were having a great time. Weather was nice, we have a nice place and love the area. I liked my new uni, my classes, professors and job.

But the last few months have been really cold and cloudy and I guess the honeymoon phase wore off? I have been thinking a lot about my undergrad and the my friends there and missing them dreadfully. I was part of a club there and we travelled a lot together to some amazing places. These were people who I could geek out with and felt totally comfortable around. This club was a huge part of my life and really kept me going during some tough times (sister in hospital, brother in rehab etc.) It was really something that I looked forward to doing each week. Also at my undergrad I had very close relationships with professors and really loved the uni and the city. 

Recently I have been going through the old photos and group chats from the club trips and even doing google map street view  of the areas where we went each year. It makes me really long for the past. At my current uni the classes are so easy, the professors don't really care or have a connection to the students and the people are quite priveleged elite people who I can't really connect with. I just sit in the back and go on my computer on google maps or twitter or something and still receiving good marks. 

So basically I have just been longing for the past, just really nostalgic about the club and trips and my time as an undergrad.  And what makes it worse is that I know that if I apply myself I can do whatever I want, I have great ideas, am a good writer and researcher. I could really make something of myself. But I am stuck. I honestly would give all of that, everything I have worked to build just to go back four years and be able to do it again. 

I am surrounded by people who love me but I just feel so completely alone. ",11Jan2019,1
29,"I'm 18 and I've finished high school. I'm going into University in the next few months. I get that I *am* still very young, and many people would still consider me a child, but I need to elaborate on what I mean. 

Every time I go out with my friends, they are treated completely normally, spoken to with the amount of respect you'd expect one human to give another, but as soon as someone speaks to me suddenly they take on this patronizing down talk, I hate it.

I have a job, I live in a sharehouse, by every metric I am just as much an adult as anyone older than me, but everywhere I go I am treated like a child.

I'm 6'1"" but built like a stringbean, narrow shoulders and skinny arms, I am covered in acne, I have an unfortunate baby face and my voice sounds like it should belong to a 14 year old.

When I woke up I was in post op and a nurse was shaking my knee saying “Hey buddy, wake up, you’ve gotta breathe. Breathe for me okay? Can you cough or take a breath?” She sounded a little alarmed. I passed out again and I woke up to an oxygen mask being shoved onto my face and a couple nurses rubbing my chest. I coughed and it felt like my ribs were being crushed. I couldn’t breathe hardly at all. It took the better part of 10-15 minutes for my breathing to feel even slightly normal. My dad looked a little worried during the whole debacle.

38,"I've always been passionate about psychology. I could read about it all day. I could talk about it all day. It lights sparkles in my eyes and there is nothing I enjoy more than learning about how we function, how we think, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

So naturally, I wanted to study it. But my parents fiercely opposed it as they saw it as a subject for ""lazy people"" that are not capable of studying anything else. They said if I liked it that much I should keep it as a hobby. I've always doubted myself, having very low self-esteem, and I've always been a people pleaser. Disappointing my parents was the worse growing up. Furthermore, I'm very sensitive and empathetic and I thought I wouldn't bare witnessing people with sorrow as a psychologist, and I didn't want to spend my days in a laboratory research (I thought these were the only options available when studying psychology). 

&amp;#x200B;

So, following my parents' advice, I chose a degree in business, and specialized later in marketing, as I saw psychological mechanisms. However, marketing is everything I hate; it's using psychology to influence people to make stupid decisions, to buy shitty and useless products, basically it drives everything I hate about this world. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will finish my master degree at the end of the year and every day I resent myself and my parents for not choosing the path I truly love and studying something I hate. Every day it's getting worse. I don't know what I'll do when I'm done with this master as I would hate working for a stupid company whose only goal is to generate profit and bring more customers. I feel like I failed, that I didn't trust in myself enough, that I'm a loser, that my life is fucking meaningless and I should have followed my passion. I thought about starting all over again, but I am 25 and I don't want to start my life at 30! I don't want to live at my parents' expenses anymore. I want to be independent.

Anyway, I just needed to rant, thank you to anyone who read this.

So I was just on winter break just like everyone (days a little bit off in Canada), and I had a physics project that is due the Friday after the break (which is today btw). I didn’t realize the assignment was due so early but a week to do so isn’t that bad. The only two friends in my physics class are already paired so I got stuck with some kid who procrastinated harder than anyone (I procrastinate but I can’t believe this guy). It’s so terrible how bad he is at that. He’s turned in so many assignments late and he’s a quiet guy. From what I’m hearing he’s smart and has a really good math grade (96, way better than mine). My guess was that we were going to finish this assignment in under 2 days but nope. Complete opposite. He messages me the Tuesday and says he has to work on English so he’ll do physics tomorrow during lunch. I’m thinking: Alright, fine I guess, I got some research done and ima call it a night. The next day I do some more research and realize that he hasn’t even logged into the doc (I made a research and presentation doc and he hasn’t logged in on any). I start to get worried but dismiss it, except for telling my friends. Now it’s Wednesday. I do a little bit of research that night before going to the gym. Then I see that he finally went on the assignment (google docs btw so live group editing and such). I come back from the gym, eat, shower and I check the doc. NOTHING, not even an edit. He just let the page sit for 3 hours. I’m still the last person that edited it. Next day I realize I’m going to have to do this shit by myself so during my spare I work on the assignment like normal, and I see his icon sitting there again (guessing he left his pages open). I go home and now I’m working again on the assignment, but today is also the day I have to finish it because I have the presentation in the morning (today because it’s 1:30 for me rn). I’m working on the doc, halfway through I see his icon. MAYBE HE’LL FINALLY DO SOMETHING. I chill for a bit, come back, and see that he messed up some of the formatting for my power point and added a bunch of text from the textbook (bear in mind that I specifically left it out because it was very  unnecessary and already had too much words on one slide). The absolute worst part is that the text is almost word for word, essentially plagiarized from the textbook (it is the textbook so I don’t really care but his effort is shit). I decide to leave it as I wanted to cherish any effort I could get from him. He sits his usual doing nothing for a few hours. Eventually he decides to erase all of the extra slides that came with the template for no reason. Wow. After that I decide to link a video to extra help, less than a minute of doing so, he decides to make sure it’s a hyperlink by editing it. I almost lost my shit. He was basically watching me do all the work. Any tiny little effort he could find to make it seem like he was doing something, he would take it. At the moment he’s left the doc for some reason (probably to get the beauty sleep that he needs for his hard work on his presentation). It’s 8 min until 2am and I’m basically done, just need to format and make a work cited (not like he was going to). I took a few snapchats of it if anyone wants proof or something, idk.

Thing is he really bothers me with his behavior IRL sometimes, when we choose to hang out he's so damn late most of the time, one time I waited freaking 1 hours for him, no kidding, I made sure we were gonna meet but the next day when I went to the place we were supposed to meet I tried to call him, ask his friends about him, no answer, until I got tired of waiting and he told me sometime later he was asleep. That was the worst but experiences like these made me don't like hanging out with him.

I don't quite remember when this started, but for a while I've had really weird, and I guess uncommon, thought processes that destroy my mood and spirit for the day. I have this mentality that I don't deserve anything good. I'd sleep on the floor instead of the perfectly made bed because I don't deserve a soft, warm bed when I'm such a piece of shit that belongs on the cold ground. When I felt sad I suppressed my crying because I don't deserve the release of emotions that will make myself feel better. I'd wear a mask from the start of school till the end of all lessons because my face looks horrible and no one deserves to see this monstrosity. Besides, better oxygen is not something I deserve. I'd find ways to self harm even if I don't have razors or lighters because I deserved pain, deserved to feel the blooming pain from my knuckles that were beginning to bruise from being slammed against a wall forty times. I'd stay away from friends (I'm not sure they are even called friends actually...) because I don't deserve the happiness that they bring me when I talk to them. I deserve to feel shitty, and horrible, and lonely. That's the mindset I'm trapped in, and I know it's so wrong to think this way because it's terribly counterproductive and unnecessary, but I really can't help it. Is this normal?

75,"Hello everyone. Before starting, I want to note that my english might be not good but I’m trying to express all of my thoughts and my feelings about study abroad life.

I come from Vietnam. First, let me talk something to make it clearly. You guys know there is an inflation in my country because of corruption of government. So that’s why Vietnamese currency is so different from others. We have to pay much money when we are in another country then. It might be a bit difficult to understand. But if you don’t understand somthing, let me know I will explain to you guys more clearly.

I’m studying abroad in Australia for a half of year. I have been here since I was 17 so I have to live in homestay with the guardian. At that time my parents paid for homestay, they paid almost everything because I didn’t get a part-time job. After 3 months of studying here, I have had a part time job at Hungry Jack’s and I did work at the weekend. We have 4 Indian managers in the restaurant. One of them is a man who always complain me almost everything. A few months ago, my roster and his are same, we work together. I was still a trainne at that time and it’s my first job. I have never serve any ice cream cones for customers so it might be a terrible ice cream cone for the first time. And in that day, when i was serving an ice cream, it’s first time though, i was trying to serve it completely but he (that manager) threw that ice cream at me and maybe he told me like it’s not your home, get out, i guess. Even though i didn’t hear clearly what did he say but when he threw it at me, it made me really upset. I was coming to cry but I was trying not to cry because we was running orders in front of customers. Since, i afraid to work here. One day, he told me like leave, go home instead of saying : you can finish now. I just feel he doesn’t like me or maybe i’m wrong?I also told it to another manager but there is nothing at all. I don’t want to make it a big deal, I just want to work in a friendly environment, we can help each other to run our own restaurant and get paid well after working hardly. But it doesn’t  seem like what I really want.

When I was over 18, I moved in to a rented room which is cheaper than homestay. As I said before, my parents paid too much money for homestay so I wanna try to pay all bills when I was over 18 already. But it makes me stressful. That’s part time job at Hungry Jack’s always makes me feel scare if I have roster that’s same as that manager throwing ice cream at me. I want to work in a long term because of well paid, and because they work legally. Just work there I can pay my own bills and I can balance my study time. But I’m really upset if I work with that manager. I don’t know how am I doing now. If i stop working there, it’s hard to get another job because I’m over 18 and there is no fastfood-restaurant will employ me. Or if I work at Vietnamesd restaurant, I just get $13/h, then I can not balance my study time. I’m so stressful now. I don’t want my parents pay my bills because they are so busy and stressful as well. My mom was pregnant for two months and I also have a younger brother, so they have a lot of things to handle. So that’s why I want to help them from working part time job then can pay my own bills.

Sometimes I just wanna give up and come back home. I used to suffer from depression before coming to Australia one month. I haven’t get out of it yet. Somedays I stuck in negative thoughts and I didn’t know how to get rid of them. I don’t know who I can share or talk what am I struggling with. My parents are so busy and so stressful, I can’t bother them. My friends have their own life and they can’t hear anything from me everyday. I have to deal with my troubles then. I’m still trying.

She said how she asked her best friend (who's ALSO on the team) if I had any friends and the girl said ""Well no. She usually just keeps to herself and she's quiet and shy. She only talks to me. "".... I went off on that. First, I'm not shy, I'm just not outgoing like the other guys are. Second off, my voice weirdly becomes soft when I talk to people I don't know. And third, I'm not fake. 

Trust me, I tried to talk to my teammates but it was soo awkward and I don't like awkward situations. I quickly picked up that I don't have anything in common with them. Emily told me that I don't have to have stuff in common with someone to be their friend. That's true but there isn't going to be anything to talk about. 

There's one thing Emily said that pissed me off. ""All you just did was sat there. "" Omg, this girl did not even speak to me when I stepped foot into the practice room. She didn't say hi, nothing. What on earth did she expect me to do? Jump into her circle of friends all bubbly and happy? This girl does not speak to me at practice! The only time she did speak to me was when I walked up to her. She knows it's hard for me to speak to people I don't know yet she expects me to just walk in and start making friends? To just walk in and start a conversation easily? 

I'd honestly rather look, hell, even be a loner than to be fake around people I don't get along with.

94,"First i had a pregnancy scare with my ex girlfriend, then said girlfriend had a miscarriage, then said girlfriend apparently has been cheating on me multiple times in our 11 month relationship, then me and said girlfriend broke up then moved on to some dude that is honestly my worst enemy for various reasons. Then i find out my friend killed himself and that a friend of mine got caught selling drugs and put in handcuffs. Then my whole entire group of friends split up so now none of them like each other, a drug dealer finds out where i live and wants me to work with him and all that plus the fact my crush who is my best friend found a new potential boyfriend. As a whole this all made me feel very insecure and sad. But i have to admit this makes me feel strangely good about myself. I don’t know what it is, maybe its because its finally the end of the week and that i can finally relax but i don’t know.",11Jan2019,1
95,"Today's my birthday, and I was scheduled in to work a shift. I'm okay with it, not a big deal, but my job sometimes leaves me mentally tired because of the level of engagement. I got on the bus and took my hat off, after wearing it all day. I could feel my hair was out of place and weird looking so I was desperately trying to fix it, and this lovely elderly lady assured me multiple times that I looked fine and not to worry about it. 

Its something small, but it means the world to me! I don't have the greatest self esteem and I don't receive compliments from people very often, so it's amazing to hear. Plus, compliments from strangers always feel different from those you know. They aren't biased by feelings so it feels more genuine. Just wanted to share that 😁

Have an awesome day reddit 🖤❤",11Jan2019,1
97,"Background: Age 25. Female. Prescribed adderall as needed. Currently living with parents. Worked at job 2 years. 


I don't even eat until 6pm most days. Maybe a granola bar. I usually start actually working around 9 then work straight until 6 with no breaks. I look like a meth-head right now. I do this 5 days a week. Maybe my dad just doesn't know this much about me but I feel like even if I told him he wouldn't understand it or care and he would probably just tell me to keep the job. I hate feeling like I'm wasting my life here. I'm stressed and malnourished. I don't even think he would care. Why do I care so much about the opinion of someone who wouldn't care if he knew I was dying. 

Maybe because I'm scared he wouldn't take me back in if I did quit my job and went out into the real world and failed. I don't know. But nobody wants to do this with me. My boyfriend wouldn’t even want to live with me. He said so. Nobody wants me. My parents only tolerate me because of this job. Nobody wants me. I feel like nobody really cares. Like I’m literally killing myself, and nobody cares. They see it. I know they see it. They see me break down they see me turn down meals and social situations they see my small frame and the hollows under my eyes and my gaunt cheeks and everybody just turns a blind eye to it, or they don’t care enough. 

I want somebody to actually rescue me and tell me it’s ok. I want somebody to help me on my own two feet if I do quit, who won’t make me feel like a burden or idiot for losing the job. I want to feel like somebody actually cares. They listen to me and it goes in one ear and out the other, they only see the money. That’s all they pay attention to. Not the adderall or the stress or the work or the starvation they only see the money. If I was making less they would have told me to quit, that it’s not worth this. But this is? This job is worth this? They haven’t experienced it. They don’t care. Nobody wants to rescue me. Nobody wants me. Nobody.",11Jan2019,1
98,"This story will be quick cause I might tell my dad I’m 15 and my brother is 21

It started of my mom finished cooking and I wanted to eat in the sun room (basically just a room) and my brother came in to eat with me. You don’t understand this kid eats insanely loud and I just wanted to watch a video without him eating so loud like it’s actually a problem it’s disgusting my dad told him and he doesn’t care cause my dad was sick of it and my mom told him he still doesn’t care so I moved to another room to eat and he just followed me and then I went back to the sunroom to eat and as I was going back to the sun room THIS KID FOLLOWED ME AGAIN so I told him “stop following me when you eat you’re so annoying” this made him mad but didn’t do anything. After I finish eating I go to the dishwasher and say thanks mom for the food and she talked to me quietly saying “why would you say that” she didn’t understand what my POV of why I said that so it makes it seem like I’m in the wrong after talking to my mom for like 10 secs and stands ups (the dishwasher is very close to the other room he was eating in)

And he says YOUVE REALLY BEEN PISSING ME OFF LATLY (he was really angry you could tell by his face) and I acting calm and said “ok” then we said a couple more stuff I was acting calm the whole time and he was yelling. my mom was holding him back (my dad was at work) then he sat back down for a sec then my mom started to talk to me again then he got up and threw his food on the floor and stood up and said “ IM SICK OF IT WANNA FIGHT” never ever I thought my own brother would say that to me never it still shocks me he said that I was sacred but my mouth told him of. I screamed at him saying “ARE YOU KIDDING ME THATS NO WAY TO BE ACTING WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHY ARE YOH DOING THIS LOOK AT YOU LOOK AT YOU WHY THERES NO REASON TO BE DOING THIS” he didn’t say anything after that cause my mom held him back. My mom told him I’m disappointed you acted like that stop it and she told him to clean up the mess which he did and I pretended to leave the house but i stood in the breeze was crying. 

Of course I love my brother but I feel he’s crazy sometimes he acts different when our dad isn’t around and he yelled at my dad once like that had a big fight  (they almost fish fought) who’s he gonna yell at next my mom I’m genuinely sacred of him at the fact he wants to hurt me i genuinely don’t feel safe around him and I feel like telling my dad but my mom doesn’t want him to know cause he 100% will kick him out 

He’s already 21 and has a job he can live on his own and I feel like it be better without him of course I love him but I don’t want him to hurt me he’s hit me sometimes when he’s angry but he holds back a little idk what to do someone please help me decide ",11Jan2019,1
99,"So,i was in my small town, waiting in a bus stop in a cold morning this November and here comes the man who lives right across the bus stop (man in his later 40's with two kids) doing stuff in his yard. My thoughts were racing in a typical way and and i hear him coughing(not particulary loud or anything) and for some reason, i instantly pictured Walter White from BB and all the other instances i've encoutered of that tv law which states ""if you're coughing you have lung cancer"" and then i tuoght of my self ""imagine if this man's innocent cough is actually lung cancer, imagine if he's about to die and doesn't know it"". 

Eventually i snapped out of it, my bus came and i forgot about this morning until a few days before Christmas: turns out the poor guy DID have lung cancer which went undiagnosed for a lomg time since he was feeling ill and was refusing to visit a doctor until he was pushed by his wife, by the time he knew it it was terminal and he passed away this week. I'm not ure about the timing but i may have knew that he's got cancer before he did.

I'm not superstitious at all but this thing has really bugged me and its probably one the weirdest experiences i've ever had",11Jan2019,1
100,"So I just got out of an uncomfortable car drive with my father, who after 16 years finally admitted that it seems like mental illnesses run in our family.

My dad has social anxiety, I have social anxiety with quasi-selective mutism (I'm too quiet, unrealistically quiet), my grandmother has depression and is taking pills, my mother has some sort of anxiety, and my sister has also reached 16 and admitted she has suicidal thoughts and will now visit a psychiatrist with the help of our parents, so that he can prescribe her pills.

My grandmothers used to tell our parents that their ""problems"" are bullshit, since she went through World War II and everything is better than what she went, so they had no right to complain, which means she educated them to think mental health is bullshit, and that it's all ""in our heads"".

Fast forward, I'm born, reach 5, and I'm WAY too quiet around other kids, so quiet in fact, that the kindergarten teachers told my parents that I should visit a psychologist.

Fuck you, first 2 psychologists.

The first one told my parents that she has no idea what's wrong, and that she will contact someone that's much more experienced than her to try and see what's wrong.

We went to him, and his solution? Show me a phone, and ask me what the buttons are on the phone. I told him the answer, because the answer was obvious, and he told my parents I'm fine.

BILL: \~$250, BECAUSE FUCK YOU.

My parents were obviously at a loss, mad, and simply hoped my social anxiety will pass.

'6 YEARS LATER'

My social anxiety didn't pass, IT GOT WORSE, my sister was already 5, and she had her own social anxiety in kindergarten, we both went to a psychologist, she saw a few more in comparison to me, I just saw one with her at the time.

First, my sister:

It seems that her teacher was a renown abusive bitch who somehow continued to work with children, and the psychologists knew about her and simply told my parents to get her out of that kindergarten ASAP.

Apparently, she was hitting children, and my sister was one of them.

Now, me:

She didn't know as well, she was at a loss, I apparently shouldn't be this shy, I can't communicate so she can't help.

BILL: \~$250 FOR BOTH OF US, RESULTS: NONE.

A few years later, in high school, I start seeing the counselor, get assigned to special classes that treat kids with study problems and mental illnesses, only for the teachers not to know how to treat me, because I didn't seem to be troubled with studies, and I understood the material, I just hated studying where I hated myself for not being able to be myself.

Also, my grandma spent time in our country, and when she left?

Depression and prescriptions for pills, and she told my parents, which is probably good enough for them to believe that she admitted she was wrong.

A few years pass, nothing happens, I join the army.

first year, a few social workers, nothing special, put a gun barrel in my mouth once.

second year, again, nothing special.

third year, put a gun barrel in my mouth again, loaded the gun, finger on the trigger, hand on charging handle, went on to a forum to rant, social worker saw it, sent me off the army for 40 days, visited a psychiatrist who prescribed me pills, and I proceeded to have THE BEST 2 WEEKS OF MY LIFE:

\- Made a farewell speech - for the first time

\- Made a birthday speech - for the first time

\- Asked a woman out - for the first time

I was fucking ecstatic, the pills worked! only the didn't!

So from what I understood, the pills are supposed to make you feel worse before you get better.

I had it in reverse, I had it better, and it only got worse the more I kept taking them afterwards, and after 3-4 months I simply stopped due to the suicidal thoughts getting worse and worse. My social anxiety is worse, my hatred to myself is worse, I just want to jump off my window or hang myself.

Fast forward, I get released from the army, and I visit my parent's home.

My sister asks me how I talked to our parents about my problems.

I didn't have the heart to tell her they won't listen, and that what will happen is a repeat of me with a gun barrel in the mouth, a step away from suicide.

A few weeks later, today, my father admit that they understood that it's probably in our blood, and that she will see a psychiatrist now rather than later.

It's too late for me now, I'm just happy my sister might have a better chance than me in life.",11Jan2019,1

104,"I was definitely in shock and not thinking clearly on the night of her death. So when the vet asked if I wanted to cremate her, I said yes. But less than 24 hours later, I realized I didn't want this at all. I wanted a piece of Mischa with me, near me, always, not just ashes. So I called a local kooky animal-bone-jewelry store and asked if they knew anyone who could preserve animal pelts. They said ""call Jeff."" But then I panicked because I realized the vet could have already incinerated her body. After being put on hold for an excruciating 10 minutes, I was told they still in fact had her body and that I could come pick it up. I picked it up this morning and then drove it to Jeff's, but not before stopping to buy a rose quartz pointed crystal. I decided to have Mischa's pelt tanned, have one of her front paws taxiermied and plugged with the crystal at one end, and to have Jeff cremate her because he told me he does it over an open fire at his ranch in Yosemite. To me, those are all way better options than just relinquishing her body to the vet and getting a scoop of ashes. I feel so much better that I am doing it this way and have so much relief.
