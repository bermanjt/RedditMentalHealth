1,"Sorry if this isn’t the best place to post, please redirect me if there’s somewhere else I should ask this.

To make things as short as possible, I have extremely regular periods, I always stick to a 28-32 day cycle and for the past two years have never been off track. 

I went  on vacation to Colorado for a whole week with my boyfriends family, 3 other girls were staying in the same place as me. I was supposed to get my period the last day I was there, but it didn’t come on time so I just figured it would be a day late or two. I got back from my trip, and immediately went back to work the next day and worked three (mon tues wed) 12-hour days in a row. Then the next day, Thursday, I got up and moved to my apartment for the upcoming semester. Now it’s almost Monday and still nothing. I’m also living with 2 girls now.

I know that exercise, stress, and also being around other girls can sync your periods, which I have all of those, but my period has been SO regular for a long time and it just seems off. I took two pregnancy tests and both came back negative, but I’m still worried as I have an active sex life.

Has anyone had a similar experience with extremely late periods?",19Aug2019,2
2,"I was always a happy kid. I smoked weed and my parents found out, they sent me away to another country for many months to learn my lesson. 


I was isolated from friends and family and forced to live with a radically Christian grandmother and a severely bi polar grandfather who liked to scream at me everyday. I didn’t speak their language so I was cut off from the world, and on top of that I was not allowed outside or allowed to have friends.

Over there I legitimately lost my mind. I found myself doing drugs no young adolescent should be doing.  I tried to kill myself, and I failed a class because I was so depressed I couldn’t keep up to date with my school work.  So I had to do an online class or I would be forced to repeat the class next year. Something I have never done before, I have never even failed a class.

I just found out I failed that class, despite me trying as hard as I could while simultaneously trying to keep my mental state together and dealing with outrageous grandparents and the school I was subscribed to trying to fail me every step of the way. 

I sit in this chair not even feeling. I don’t knowing to describe what I’m feeling. It feels like I’m just here, and my whole body is swirling, over and over and over. I don’t want to feel this, but it’s all I feel. I don’t know what I’m doing, or why I’m doing or anything. I want it all just to stop. 

Thank you for listening, I wanted to posts my first thoughts as I stare at the screen, failing by 1.5 points.  1.5 points away from passing. Another post coming right after this one detailing just what the fuck went on over there in that country. Peace out for now.",19Aug2019,1
3,"I \[19M\] have had on and off feelings for my best female friend of 5 years. I also know from mutual friends that she has liked me during periods of our friendship but things never lined up for us and so we have never dated. I will also say that while we talk about a lot of things, we have never talked about each other.

&amp;#x200B;

This past year we both entered out first year of university and I went to a university 6 hours away so we stopped talking as much but still caught up on each other's lives whenever we did see each other. Fast forward to summer, we start hanging out a bit more because I'm back in town and it's great because she's awesome to talk to. I slowly start to realize that my feelings for her are coming back but I sort of shrugged it off because I knew that she went through a breakup in January. We hang out this one day where I asked to go mini-golfing and it was fun and light, and later she asked we meet with another one of our friends and just hang out. Later that week, I hear from a mutual friend that the day we went mini-golfing, she told her friend that the day was feeling too much like a date and she was scared of catching feelings for me again and that I would just leave for university again once summer was over. That was why she asked to hang out with another friend later that day.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to near the end of summer, we still text regularly, and one day I ask to hang out with her to get dinner and go rollerskating after since we have talked about going before. We go and the day was fun because she didn't know how to skate and I was sort of half teaching her, half dragging her along the rink. I know we both had fun but there was a moment when it was just couples skating on the floor, and there was silence between us just watching the couples skate. I felt like maybe there was a chance where I could've said something but I didn't because I wasn't sure what to actually say.

&amp;#x200B;

I am having a party with my friends later this week and I was thinking of confessing to her to just say how I feel since I'm going back to university anyways in about 2 weeks. The thing is, we have a great friendship and I'm not sure how she would react to my feelings. Even if she did like me, I am going back to school and I don't even know if a LDR is something I would do. I also don't know if maybe I should just bury my feelings again like I have before because it's worked out pretty well so far. Or what if she does have feelings for me but doesn't want a relationship because of the distance? I guess I'm thinking too much about it but I really don't know.",19Aug2019,1
4,"I was a happy kid all my life. Very handsome, smart, extremely fit and had no problems getting friends or  girls. Then it all came crashing down upon me in 2019.

I tried weed and my parents found out. I was taken out of my school, and shipped off to another country where I can “Learn my lesson” and be “straightened out”. 

I was living in a country where I did not speak a lick of the language, and I was put in a Christian school (I’m atheist) and I was banned from having friends or leaving the house, which had walls surrounding it and cameras everywhere.  I did not have a lock on my door and had to keep it open all day and I was permitted to close it at night.

I lived with my very radically Christian grandmother, and my severely bi polar grandfather who would scream at me everyday because I tried to get him to take his meds. And no one else.

I enjoyed relative freedom before, but now that house became my prison. I legitimately went insane there. I found myself doing drugs no one under 30 should do, at about half the age. I ended up drinking a lot. Like A LOT. And I have always hated alcohol but it helped me deal with being trapped in a house.

My once good grades started to slip, and I ended up failing a class because I was just too depressed to do the work. I wasn’t allowed to work out outside, my only option being a Christian gym 40 minutes away that I hated. 

I tried to kill myself last month, and I ended up not succeeding. When my parents heard this I was brought back, where my parents are telling me I didn’t try hard enough in my courses and maybe that’s why I was depressed.

I lost 20 pounds of muscle, most of my friends, my girl, and my dignity. I feel like I’m not a person, I’m just a reaction to things. I feel ripped out of my body, and I’m just watching myself do things as if it was a tv show. I feel all swirly inside in ways I can’t describe, and I feel sadder than ever knowing I failed my summer school course by 1.5 points. My parents don’t know yet but they will find out soon.  I just hope they can understand. 

I love my parents with all my heart, and it’s been rough, but i trust they will come around. Right now I’m just trying to pick up the pieces from when my mind was shattered with a wrecking ball. Thank you for listening.",19Aug2019,1

8,"EDIT: I already posted this in another subreddit but I really need some advice from people on if I behaved wrong or if anyone has so good advice.


This isn’t exactly recent but isn’t completely old later. This took place around 2 months ago. I’m still considered a minor and am female for some background information. 

So around two months ago I decided to come out to my mother as gay. At first she seemed fine with it and it really didn’t seem too bad. However, the next day I decided to tell her that in the past I had dated a girl. She immediately flipped out and started calling me manipulative, abusive, a liar, and many other things along the lines of a traitor and a fake. This went on for almost 5 days, and I got fed up with her behavior. So I went ahead and told her this was really disgusting behavior and she wasn’t acting like a parent; she told me I was being an arrogant teenager. 

Fast forward a week or so and everything seems fine. Until she starts nitpicking at everything I do. Didn’t tell her about a friend? She’d scream at me, didn’t eat all of my dinner or lunch? Another screamfest. This got so bad that I started locking myself away from her because I couldn’t take all of this.

Fast forward another couple of weeks and she calls me and arrogant bitch for not giving her a hug? I know I may have come off as rude because I was moody that day and I didn’t ask how her work day was but I don’t think it warranted that reaction. 

An instance soon after that happened where one of my teachers found out about my condition and called the counselor. The counselor had to notify my mom and then she talked to me. 

She said that I had caused all the fights with her by being rude and arrogant and she never had a problem with me being gay. And that I was troubled because I had a somewhat troubled past. I got fed up and told her I was locking myself away because of her bad parenting skills and the fact she wasn’t raising me right. Am I the asshole? She’s been acting alright for almost a week now but I still feel contempt against her and I know that at times I can be moody and rude. And I know that she did do a lot for me, I’m just not sure who’s right here.

I did hide the fact I had dated someone from her, and I can see how she’d get mad about that. But I knew she hated this person. (The girl I had dated wasn’t a bad person, didn’t do drugs, never abused me, did sports and had a good social life. My mom just didn’t like her.) so I knew that if I told my mom she would immediately make me break off the relationship. What should I do if I get into another relationship in the future? And how do I make sure to steer clear from this in the future? Was my mom right for acting this way?",19Aug2019,1
9,"I’m a 15 year old male and for about a year now I have noticed I lie about almost everything and it’s really messing with me mentally. For example I needed to leave playing football with my friends a bit early to go have dinner out with my dad then play some pool, but what I told them was that i was going out on a date with this girl who I wouldn’t tell them. Slowly as I told each and everyone of my friends all the details that I’m making up I start to believe it myself and get nervous about a date that I’m not even going on. By the way I lie a lot and mostly about girls that I like to my friends saying things like we are going on a date and I’m talking to her or meeting up with her. I have never even flirted with a girl,not even held hands and not even hugged but all my friends are getting girls and doing everything that entails. I’m getting sidetracked but my point is that I believed I was going on a date and I had butterflies and when I got to the restaurant with my dad I felt sick because of the nerves. So basically it’s ruining days out and relationships I have with people and I’m unreliable and untrustworthy to even my family.

10,"so recently, I rekindled things with my ex (after a long break) whom i thought i was absolutely in love with. so much so that we often had conversations about eloping. well, this past Sunday he broke up with me and blocked me on everything with no explination. thats the hardest part for me. not knowing makes me wildly anxious and I can barely function. this break up was unique because I really didnt see it coming. normally I can tell when a relationship is going nowhere fast, but we were making promises, opening up, and planning for our future. he even shared his suicidal tendencies with me (after 1 1/2 years!) and allowed me to help talk him through it. he's told me so many times that if I were to leave him he'd legitimately have nothing to live for, and I knew what he was implying and I believed him. I felt like it was us against the world and thats why im absolutely shocked he did this. 

 turns out he's a lying, manipulative, misreable piece of shit. he's back on Tinder within a week's time looking for something ""casual"". 

I accept full responsibility for putting myself in this situation. I was played. but i just wanted this to be a P.S.A to all these disgusting fucking people who use suicide as a way to control someone who cares about you. 

those who use mental illness as a clutch, excuse and/or bargaining tool in a relationship. romantic or not. 

those who are willfully inconsiderate to your S.O- during bad times or not- just to make it easier on themselves. 


personally, I hope he's happy for as long as he can be before he realizes that treating people like garbage has fucking consequences.",19Aug2019,1

12,"I tend to put myself down because I have dark skin.  When I meet people (specially white) I automatically think they’ll like me less because I have darker skin. Soon I’ll be moving abroad to a predominantly white country and I’m currently looking for housing through a website where you have to input your photo and some personal details. Lately I’ve been messaging people on there to tell them I’m interested in being their flatmate. However like 80% haven’t replied at all. And as you may have guessed, the first thought that came to mind was “it’s probably because I’m not white”

Honestly this shit is getting on my nerves and it needs to stop ASAP. I don’t know how to do that tho, it literally refuses to leave my brain and isn’t helping my self-esteem.

13,"So this is pretty new and a little uncomfortable for me as I absolutely never vent to people. I just feel like I don't have the proper people to express myself to, and I'll elaborate as to why that is later on in this post. I'm kinda excited to type it all out here as I feel like it'll be therapeutic. I'm very grateful that despite the various issues that I'm going to discuss in this post that I'm not depressed nor do I feel quite overwhelmed. I'm usually a very calm optimistic person and even though I'll occasionally feel stuck and have some hope zapped outta me, I'll always bounce back and be optimistic and hopeful once more. I suppose I don't give myself enough credit for how well I believe I'm able to shoulder the weight of all my issues and not get absolutely crushed. Despite this, I still have been longing for a person to communicate this problems to and I've decided to make this post. Warning, this is probably gonna be a long post. 

Awkwardness:

Where do I start? I'm supposing one of my larger issues would be trying to remain confident and feeling secure in public, which I think I've been improving a lot at. Still though, I feel extremely awkward in public and it most certainly impacts how I feel. At home I feel like I'm on top of the world, I feel like I'm an amazing person who can do anything especially considering how my parents and siblings treat me, with respect. But in public it all melts away. I can still remain secure and think and talk faster than a bullet when I'm surrounded by my friends and people I know and trust, but when it comes to anything less than that I'm really awkward. It really doesn't help that my vision is extremely shitty and while my hearing isn't awful it can most certainly be better. I don't use glasses and I'm hoping to eventually get contacts, but for now its difficult to identify facial expressions (and by extension mood) from people that are not too terribly far away from me. Its harder to tell if someone is engaged with me or not and its a little frustrating. This one time me and my two friends, one of them is rather special and I'll get to that later, but we were walking around a pretty loud gym in laps and one person comes up to me and wants me to stick this metal pole into a hole in the ground. I can't hear what he's said and I can only see blurs at his distance, but still I walk up to him and grab the pole. I'm under the impression that he wants help carrying it elsewhere and he's trying to tell me that I'm incorrect. That special friend of mine laughs and does the job for me. That was pretty embarrassing but to be honest I do think that'd be pretty hilarious watching it all happen from the outside. But this was an example of how my less than stellar hearing and my pretty bad vision has screwed me over. 

Friends and family:

My family is a little wack. My mom and dad are getting a divorce for several reasons. My dad used to be a pretty bad alcoholic but he finally quit after me and him were starting to get physical during one of his episodes. I'm very proud of how far he's come and how much he's cleaned up, but it took him the better part of 14 years to do this. Now he vapes which I find very stupid and at the same time hilarious. My mom has found a new partner in California but this time with an amazing twist, I'm gonna end up having two moms. Sometime next year, probably summer of 2020 we're going to move in with my brand new second mom. I've already met her and she's actually a really good person, but this is still obviously going to be pretty odd at first. Even if it was just a new dad that'd be shaking. I do like my dad, although I think he's pretty simple sometimes and gullible. Around a week ago the divorce was well underway and he was on some dating website or something. Some thot tricked him into giving her his credit card info and he lost $1200 or something. My mom was actually surprisingly careless about it. But the point I'm trying to get at is that despite my love for my obviously imperfect but still caring and hardworking father is that I feel like I never had a really good father figure or parent for that matter when it comes to proper guidance. I've learned and figured out so many things completely independent of both my father and my mother. I've accepted my mortality for one, I understand my passion and I work to try and achieve it, and I'm hoping to live a simple but happy life. I don't plan to become anything incredible or achieve anything big, I just wanna have a happy fulfilled life and have some kids. I'd say the closest thing I have to a real parent or father figure, the one person giving me guidance would be Jordan Peterson, I really care about him and I admire him and see him like the ideal father that I didn't quite have. My mom always tells me that I'm more of a father figure to my siblings than my dad, which I believe may be true. I always listen to what they have to say and their problems, they're very comfortable with expressing their issues to me, and I'll give them my best advice. I'd say usually I end up making a significant positive impact on them.  

Now most of my current friends are good. Before I went to my freshmen year of High school I was homeschooled for all of middle school. So I really didn't start off on the best footing. However I managed to reunite with my old friends from elementary and got to know their friends. Now I've got a cute little network of people I know. However I'd say the ones that are really good friends and not simply people I know would be this interesting soviet guy who'd bring his Russian hat to school. This guy actually contacted me one night to discuss how he was concerned that another person was being manipulative towards me, and he said that he couldn't stand seeing his friend used. That really touched me since that never really happened to me before. The other friend was this interesting... nazi. I've always had an edgier sense of humor and for some reason I was extremely interested in nazism and facism, like I'm talking the ideologies and what happened to the countries that embraced them. I met this guy who I at first thought had similar interests and humor and he actually treated me pretty well at first. He was a handsome popular kid who literally did shit like moonwalk in the middle of the hallway with crowds of people recording him and cheering him on. I observed him and attempted to improve my confidence which worked rather well actually. I learned how to project my voice and all that good stuff, how to walk in front of a ton of people without completely dying inside. This guy led a small group of pushovers, me included. Upon closer inspection this guy really isn't all that he appears to be, he was an arrogant nazi who doesn't know what he's talking about. And once I started to become greater friends with the significantly less popular but much friendlier Russian guy, I cut the Nazi outta my life. The entire time I merely thought he was just memeing like I was when it came to nazism, and everyone else who knew him like I did thought the same. But him and his brother were actual Nazis, and when they found out I wasn't a nazi they scolded me claiming I was part of the problem and I was an SJW and shit. For the school presidency thingy they decided to dress up as nazis using modern day german uniforms (which I actually managed to buy off one of them for only $5) and proceeded to march around blasting the greatest song ever, ""springtime for hitler"" and seiging heil. What amazes me though is that nobody cared and that they never got in trouble. I've got very little respect for this guy but I would actually dare to say that the impact he left on me was more positive than negative. I learned how to become more confident which is something that I'm by no means close to achieving 100% but I'm making progress. I wouldn't have it any other way, him and his group are just a joke between me and my old friends from elementary school now. There is a specific person from school that has had a very very large impact on me both for the better and the worse, and I'll get to that in a bit.

Skin and weight issues:

When I first returned to public school I was overweight at 220 pounds. Now, several months later (basically a year later) I'm sitting at 165 pounds. My ultimate goal is 150 pounds which I'm very close to actually. However, for the past few months, ever since may it seems I haven't been able to shed a single pound. Recently, I mean like this and last month, I have undergone a massive elimination diet where I cut out basically all processed foods and I follow  a stricter KETO regiment. Or at least I try to. It's very disheartening whenever I mess up, since it seems like after 3-4 days of eating clean I'll mess up and just eat as many carbs and as many junk foods as I can find. This is obviously something that has to stop. I've convinced my mother to take us to Costco so we can buy more organic foods in bulk. I take on the role of cooking, every morning I wake up at 5:30 and I eat the breakfast I prepared for myself the previous day, then I cook eggs, chicken, steak, salmon, etc for everyone else. I enjoy this a lot and its a great source of confidence. I feel amazing the fact that I cook my own healthy food and that my siblings talk about how superior my food is to my mom. Its a little bit taxing cooking some 3 times a day but I think its worth it. I've been trying to clean up my diet not just for my weight, but also my skin. I've got the usual acne, but mine is actually pretty minor and not my main priority. My skin texture is just overall very rough and not the most pleasant thing in the world. I also have some pretty bad eczema on my arms and legs. Especially when exposed to direct sunlight, my arms are actually pretty disgusting. So in an attempt to heal my very rough skin I've taken on intermittent fasting plus a KETO diet + low oxalate diet. My skin feels smoother and I've really only started doing this for some 3 weeks, but I can tell that my regular junk food eating will derail the progress I'm trying to make. My binges aren't coming from me not eating enough, I get around 1800 - 2000 calories a day plus exercise so I'm in a bit of a deficit. But rather, my binges come from my pretty intense carb cravings. And once you give into one, the cravings never go away and just get more intense. I essentially just make ""one exception"" but then I make a second, and then I'm thinking that because I failed I can eat another piece of junk food. And then it spirals outta control, exception after exception. So after all is said and done, I'd say I'm a little below average looking. It bothers me, yes but who isn't bothered by their looks especially at my age. At school I can sometimes fluctuate from not giving a damn to being super self conscious. (I'll make it clear now that while I'm eating healthier to improve looks yes, my main goal is simply becoming healthier overall since my previous diet when my parents were in charge of it was just endless ice cream and pizza, I'd say that really screwed me over in the health department. I seriously never ate vegetables until recently when I took full control of what I did and didn't eat.) Now, me looking a little below average has a very significant impact on my final subject.

Crush:

I believe that the ideas and thoughts in my head become more unhealthy and are generally at their worst when I'm thinking about my crush. I knew her ever since elementary school and we were friends for all that time. She lives like right next to my house (but due to the divorce me, my siblings and my mom are gonna be moving to some apartment for a little while so it might not stay like that, might change in a couple months). She's a really beautiful and kind girl. I had a crush on her for a little while in elementary but she tried to politely reject me claiming I was chubby. Which I really was, I mean chubby is putting it lightly. I don't resent her for this, I don't think anyone should see this as a bad thing. I completely support her past decision. She actually tried to encourage me to go on a diet, think she'd be proud of me if she saw what I was doing now? We continued to be good friends and while she ended up being greater friends with my sister than with me at some point, we got along well. Now, her mother had a sort of cancer. Her mother and I got together really well and its a shame I don't remember as much of these times as I'd like. There was this odd time where it felt like I was apart of her family and she was apart of mine, I mean we were really close. But her mother died. I feel so terrible for this girl for having to go through that at such a young age. Now at this period in time I feel like, and I stress feel because I'm not too certain, (i mean why else would she be friends with me) i feel like my past self during these times was a significantly larger cunt then I am today. I don't know why, but I get this sense that I was an asshole and I feel guilty towards the way I treated my crush. I don't know if this is true, because these memories are very foggy, but one memory I recognize clear as day went like this. Her mom had recently died and she was acting strange, she was oddly energetic and honestly a little annoying. I was acting cold towards her and when her dad came to pick her up and honked the horn, I said ""Oh thank god please be your mom"". Because her mom was the one who would usually pick her up. I replay this a lot in my head and I feel so fucking shitty when I do so. We still continued to hang out after this and I honestly don't think she even remembers but I just feel like I was a really bad person when I was younger. I know I used to steal Lego from the church, if that counts. That probably counts. For the first half of the brand new experience that was high school I did little in the way of self improvement and maintenance physically speaking. My health was still extremely poor and while I may think I look slightly below average now, I was a fucking train wreck. My crush ended up going to the same high school as I and I didn't quite have a crush on her yet. I didn't harbor and guilty feelings towards her yet. I just recognized her as an old friend and she even approached me several times to say hi. She was being very friendly and just hadn't changed at all. She was great. I had a crush on this other girl during this first half of school, but I eventually lost interest when all my attempts to learn more about her failed. But I did actually get her phone number once which never happened to me before, that was a confidence booster. I had no crush at this time but then I realized something. I realized that this girl from my past was just perfect. She had rejected me once in the past but this time things can be different. This is when I realized I had a new crush, a crush on my old crush. So for the entire second half of school I started a massive self improvement campaign. So no matter all the guilt that may be trapped in my brain and heart regarding this person, I've still got her to thank for getting my life in order. I was fixing up my life but I wasn't doing it for myself, I was doing it for her. My plan was that I'd get everything in order and improve my looks significantly and then confess to her. Now, it wasn't like we had any large extended periods of time we could spend together, we had no classes together and would only occasionally see each other for brief instances. In fact I may have seen her only a total of 15 times during the entire school year, a handful were pretty extended but that was pre crush. Anyways, I'm working towards improving myself and trying to become the best mate I can be. I'm excited that I have this new crush and I tell my friends. They're extremely supportive and I talk to them about the hints that I believed she was dropping for me. In hindsight I can still tell why I thought these things were hints, I mean she would come up to me smiling very wide saying that I was tall and hugging me. She was also sorta awkward in this adorable way. One day me and a bunch of people are in front of the gym and one of my friends brings up my crush. Everyone starts talking about it and how I should just ask her out, where I explain that even if I had the balls to do it I can't since I don't know where she is. I know she lives right next to me but I'm not gonna walk down to her house to tell her, I'll wait until I can do it at school. One cuck said that he had my crush's phone number and he proceeded to text her saying that I wanted to date her. I ran up and stole his phone and deleted the message before it was sent, but I had to eventually reluctantly return it to this cuck and he sent the message while laughing in my face. Everyone was huddled around the phone waiting for a repy and I walked to my final class full of anxiety. When I got home my friend gave me a screenshot of her reply, which was short and sweet. I don't feel the same way about him, all that stuff. It was a little shocking. Looking back I completely understand that I had essentially nothing to bring to the table in terms of looks or ability (which I'm thinking I've taken care of to a large extent now) but for some reason I had completely convinced myself that she also had a crush on me. So I was crushed (ha) to say the least. I was just kinda in shock, but I was pissed that I couldn't talk this over with her and that I almost never get to see her. It took almost an entire month before me and my friend were just walking down the sidewalk at school, I was singing the German marching song Erika, when from behind me someone yells my name. Its my crush, and she waves. My heart rate increases and I just continue singing like nothing happened, but I'm freaking out internally. I realized that she was with someone else, someone who appeared taller than her and was quite possibly a male, and knowing how great of a person she was, I assumed that it was likely a boyfriend of sorts. Which, even though I had mostly accepted that she had rejected me, still hurt a little. I couldn't quite tell who this person was or what their gender really is, like I explained earlier my vision is really shitty, but that's the conclusion I came to. Most likely a male person, and a decent chance its a romantic partner. When I got home I kinda just listened to ""Hope for the best expect the worst"" by mel brooks over and over again. It helped cope. I was shaken for that day and then I returned to school the next largely over it. In my mind back then, I still had some hope even post rejection that I could turn that around, especially since she hadn't known about the large changes in personality and weight I've had. I would jokingly say that I became a nazi due to my great obsession with it. The last few times I saw her I had either spoken to her in german before giving  a salute or mentioned how 4Chan wanted to make the hashtag simple into a nazi symbol. So I'm thinking there is a possibility she thinks I'm an actual Nazi. oof. My sister is going to be a freshmen this year and I'll be a sophomore. My crush as far as I know is a lot better friends with my sister than with me at the moment and I've been encouraging my sister to reunite with my crush. Now, I'm doing this because my sister is even worse socially then I was when I first entered high school and I want her to have a female friend (I'm a guy) right off the bat. However, the issue with this is that I'll probably be seeing my crush a lot more. This is terrifying for me. Its also a scary idea that she might be in any one of my classes this year. I'll figure out when it starts in august 26th, literally one day after my birthday. Still, I harbor thoughts and ideas that she wants to stay away from me and that she doesn't like me, which while under careful review of what she's said to me and how she's acted towards me in the past makes it clear this is likely not the case, I still feel like she does. I feel shame and guilt for having a crush on this person who I think is superior to me in terms of how kind they are and how they behave and how they look. I'd love to meet with them again and explain how for some reason I feel guilt towards her. I feel like my past self, when we were greater friends let down her and her mother. I don't know why, again most of this is based of a select few of foggy memories. 

Anyways, that's it. These are the main issues I'm facing right now. It was nice to vent, and holy shit this is a long post. Sorry no TLDR, I've gotta go to bed. Its 9:30 and I need to get up early to make breakfast.",19Aug2019,1

15,"I’m 20 and I met a guy (25) while travelling. It was a fling but we both seemed really into each other and we’d go out of our way to meet each other. His English wasn’t the best but it was good enough for us to talk. 

I was a virgin and I’ve never had a boyfriend before (I had so much fun acting all coupley with him) and on my last night I decided I wanted to lose it with him (I didn’t tell him I was a virgin though, just super inexperienced. I was very serious about condoms and we went to the store to buy some. I’m very paranoid so I even told him to make sure to not take the condom off. 

The sex goes seemingly good until he finishes INSIDE ME and I realize the condom is nowhere to be found. I ask him what happened and he says he took it off as if it’s no big deal. I immediately started crying and yelling and calling him a rapist. He did get me plan b the next morning at least. (I’ve also had STD tests since then). 

This happened almost two months ago and I just can’t stop thinking about it. I keep feeling stupid sometimes like I overreacted. He did seem really sorry when I called him out but kept defending himself saying he’s not a rapist. We talked a bit since then and recently I messaged him saying I still feel really shitty about it and he told me he’s sorry and he knows it’s his fault but we both need to get over it and that he doesn’t want this to continue and then he said he still thinks of our good memories and misses me. He also recently changed his relationship status from single to in a relationship. 

I don’t even know why but I just feel so hurt by everything. It kills me how he doesn’t even care that much what happened and he obviously doesn’t care much about me. I guess when I messaged him I was expecting him to be sad over what happened. I’ve never felt so sad and confused about anything and everyone I’ve talked to feels like I should be over this and I literally have no one to talk to about it anymore. This whole thing also made me feel so disposable, as if I’ll never mean anything to a guy. Is it normal to be this upset over it? I feel like I’m in pain when I think of it. I’m also having trouble telling if I’m upset because I liked him and I’m sad that it’s over or if I’m upset over the fact that my body was violated. What do you guys think? 

I still think about the guy a lot and then I feel stupid for missing someone who hurt me like this. Sometimes I even feel like I was too hard on him when I freaked out over what happened, I said a lot of hurtful things to him. I feel like I’m having trouble accepting that it’s over and I need to let go of what happened but I don’t know how.",19Aug2019,3

17,"I've graduated high school yeeears ago. First thing I realised about being the funny guy is that my school, collectively, had a different sense of humour from different schools, so I kind of concluded that different places have different humour.

Anyway, I'm still funny to the few school friends I see from (loooong) time to time, but not so much to other people.

I was funny to my close college friends though, but others - not so much.

During my time in college, I thought it was because I'm very formal with most people and try to be polite and limit how close I get to the people I meet cause I really don't want to be ""close"" friends with most of them, so I'm friendly, but not a friend, so they never really see my more natural side/humour.

But in later years, when I've settled in life and accepted what I've become and don't pretend to be someone else to people and just treat everyone the same, I found out that I'm waaay out of it, lmao.

It's been such a long time since I've cracked a joke to a stranger at one point, that I got confused and upset from how they took it. A few more jokes to different people later (of course in different days, different occasions), I realised that people never get that I'm joking cause none of them know my dry sense of humour, so I've learned that I need to make it more obvious.

Christ, you can't imagine the number of fake laughs I've made after I see a lack of reaction in people. And it's so painfully and obviously fake. I actually do it on purpose so that it would either sound funny on its own, or it would pass off as a complimentary laugh.

My friends would always nudge me and tell me ""it's so fucking fake, the person you tried to make laugh thinks you're laughing at them"".

I'm extremely out of it, even though it was strange and (I know it's silly) painful to know that I'm not as funny as I used to be and that I can't get the same reactions again back when I ""started to try to be funny again"", but now I am very okay with it.

Not only do I accept it, but I actually have a lot more laughs with myself now, and kind of my new funny. I'd laugh the shit out of something and someone next to me would catch on the contagious laughter, even at the silliest shit.

I could never be flirtatiously funny though, that was never my strong suit and it has never ever worked for me. I could pull off deliberately cringey funniness, but being flirty would just be regular irreversible cringe.",19Aug2019,1
18,"He is everything to me. While I know we'll talk a lot and probably visit once or twice, it feels like I am losing him and my heart is breaking. 


Nothing's going to be the same. I'll have to face every day with the knowledge that I won't be coming home to him, can't turn to him for a hug, can't reach down and hold his hand. Can't see his eyes crinkle as he smiles at me when he catches me watching him. I love just watching him, even if that sounds weird.


I love every inch of him. I'm a very physically affectionate person and it's going to be tough to lose his touch. Sleeping on my own sucks. I don't want to do it.


I'm scared of saying goodbye. I cry a lot and easily, and I just know I'm going to be an absolute tearful wreck. I don't want him to leave on that note, but at the same time my emotions won't let me pretend to be okay. I haven't even decided yet if I want to go to the airport with him, or just say goodbye before.

A month in, I started to experience internal problems and could not find a solution. It affected my mental state as well as my relationship. Over the course of this break I have started to find myself spiritually and really asking myself what I believe in. I felt as if I had found something to put faith in. March break, my friends and girlfriend went on a road trip staying at each others homes. It was a great time, very lovely. I'd never done anything like that. Come May we decide to take a road trip to Georgia. That was a fantastic trip for a month, it really let me breathe in and take in things I don't normally experience. However I wasn't physically present as I was sucked into my phone. I felt guilty, and it really put a strain on the entire trip.

July. She ended things with me. I am still not over it, mainly due to the fact that I feel very frustrated and angry at myself because of how she and I handled the situation.

I graduated college, moved to a new city, got my 1st career job and began my next chapter in life. I saw changes coming, but I didn't know what those changes would be of.
The awkward teens people say, when one goes through physical and emotional transformations. Socially, one struggles to fit in or stand out. It's the attempt to create a molding for oneself and see what qualities hold as the transition goes into adult hood. 
However, being in your teens you are still under your parents wing. You have some freedom to be you, but not as much freedom for when you reach the adult stage. The stage where you pay your own bills, supply your food, get your own insurance and make sure you make it on time for work. 
Now the real awkwardness hits....life lessons.
Self reality checks 
Burned bridges
Your truest friends
These are the years I am needing to evaluate my character. Fine tuning we could say. Now we get into the deeper shit where mistakes cost me something. Good news is I am learning from them. Bad news, it freaking sucks feeling the pain after making the wrong call or saying something you shouldn't have said. Or not saying anything at all. The list can go on. These are the years of discovery, they say. Can I add awkward too? It's uncomfortable moments to experience and some could have avoided, but others, well thats life saying ""not today, you gon' learn."" 
It's like a rollercoaster of emotions being in your 20s. And I'm running low on positive energy at the moment. I'm my own cheerleader because being an adult doesn't permit you to rely on others if you can't rely on yourself first.

41,"TL;DR I thought I was schizophrenic or having small seizures after I cold turkey quit my meds. Come to find out i was just going through dissociation. While I’m relieved to find out what’s going on with me, I wish I knew how to handle it.



In 2016 I cold turkey quit all my meds one by one. First seroquel, then lithium, then Effexor. Ive been on meds since I was 15 and when I turned 19 in 2016 I figured I was ready to quit. I stopped seeing my psychiatrist and started my cold turkey journey. I was doing “ok” until I dropped the Effexor. In hindsight, I was manic the entire time but things took a huge turn when I quit Effexor.

I always dealt with depression but quitting meds introduced me to anxiety and panic. I started feeling foggy and started making a lot of mistakes at work. I just couldn’t focus for shit. Next thing I know my speech started to change. Slurring words, stuttering, damn near talking like yoda. Then it started happening. I felt like I wasn’t in my own body anymore. I felt like my lens would turn from reality to feeling like a was in a movie. As if my eyes were the camera and I was just watching life like some kind of movie. Nothing felt real. Looking at my arms felt like I was looking at someone else’s body.

I checked myself into the ER a handful of times because I thought I was going through psychosis. They just gave me one time sedative pill for the night. Of course the episodes kept happening. I thought I was having either small seizures or I was schizophrenic. I didn’t want to ask or google it because I was terrified to confirm it. Finally after months, I googled my exact symptoms and found so many articles of dissociation. I was *relieved*.

I am back on meds, lithium and lamotrigine, but still don’t exactly know why I get these episodes. They happen out of no where – at work, bars, with a friend, at a restaurant, sometimes alone. It’s been hitting hard today and I’m glad I know what going on I just wish I knew how to handle it.",19Aug2019,2
42,"I kind of want to get this out there and maybe form some kind of discussion. 

I've come to a realisation, my best friend of 10 years, isn't the best to be around after I moved in with her. 

I've knew from the very beginning it was not a good idea for her to move in with me. She's somewhat of a slob, not very good with money and it's her first time ever moving out, while I've left home around 2 years now. 

Well there were a number of reason why I asked her to move in with me. 
1. Rent will reduce to half 
2. I'll have a companion (I'm 5'2 and a girl.)
3. Her family is toxic, as she has told me and I've seen in person, and she wants out. 

I've only moved in with her around 2 months now and within the first week we had problems. 

My main concern is cleaning after yourself. I literally do not care about anything as much as that. To be honest, that was really the only thing that drove me up the wall. 
I spotted her when she couldn't pay the bond and the first 2 months of rent (she started a new job a few weeks before we moved in and they pay monthly and the second month she needed to pay off some debt, after finally being employed of 6 months of unemployment) and I did all the cleaning of  the house on my own (but I have to give her credit, she organised the place really nicely). I'm not saying all this stuff to humbly brag, but I want to paint the picture is that all I wanted was her to clean up after herself. That mattered to me the most. 

It made me feel horrible when I tell her to clean up after herself because she gets super mopey. 

It frustrated me even more is when after a month of me being frustrated at her and repeatedly asking her to clean up after herself, she spoken to our mutual friends - and I'm assuming her friends - of how I'm mean and is mothering her when I've spoken to her before and after moving in together of how I feel about your own mess.

We talked about it and she admitted she was completely in the wrong and decided to move out to save our friendship. 

But what's eating me up about this whole ordeal is that I lost respect for her and I feel like she's not the type of person I really want to be around. And I hate that. She's the reason the person I am now. She's the reason I stand up for myself. She's the reason I'm so great because I'm not that great. She made me this way. Without her, I'm not me. 

I don't know if it's because I've grown up or I'm finally seeing her who she truely is after all these years. She's not a bad person, far from that. I love her, but it seems she's more bad than good.",19Aug2019,1

44,"Even now I'm faking it. I'm sobbing at this realization, but yet I'm doing my best to stay quiet so that I don't wake him up. I'm faking not crying.

And I'm a coward. I'm too afraid to say the truth, because it embarrasses me. Yet what am I really afraid of? I already feel miserable inside and I fake being okay.

He was honest with me during the first few months of dating in saying he never wanted to get married, and I was okay with that because I felt the same way. At the time. But I'm not the same person I was 6 years ago. I'm not the same person I was because of him.

I never thought about marriage until he would always bring up...constantly asking in a dreamy sigh, ""When are we getting married?"" he'd ask how much it would cost to get married at a court house... Or he'd point out a ring I'd have my eye on (general rings since I like wearing them on every finger) and say, ""Get it! This could be our wedding ring.""... To which I didn't... 
He'd talk about getting married to me and moving out of the country together. 

These comments over 6 fucking years fucked with me so much, and I didn't realize it until now. I had slowly started to entertain thoughts of getting married to him, until I actually now **do** want to get married to him. Just last month he said again, ""when are we getting married?""

And I finally responded, ""Maybe next year. I still have to work some things within myself.""

And you know what those internal things are? The original thing that made me not want to get married before: My low self-esteem. The fact that I'm a faker. The fact that I'm a coward. Being told growing up by my mom that I should never get married be anyone who does will just end up leaving me. And I believed it--in past tense--now again in present tense.

But over these 6 damn years, constantly getting comments put on me about marriage, the fact that this guy is still with me, made me actually start to believe that it could be possible... Maybe I was actually good enough. Maybe I was loved enough to be desired as a wife... Maybe he wouldn't leave me.

Then yesterday happened. His brother's bachelor and bachelorette party... To a woman he'd only be dating 3 years--to which the woman thought it took him a long time to ask her to marry her...

My boyfriend was not happy about going to the party, telling me his brother is cuck and then proceeded to say, ""I'd never do this. I'm never getting married. So don't expect me to ask you to get married. Marriage is a trap.""

All I could say was, ""But...."" before he adamantly said, ""Sorry if you wanted to get me, but I'm not. That's just the way I feel.""

And hit cut me so fucking deep. I sat there feeling so fucking stupid. All those marriage comments he made over the years were just jokes. He had probably been elated with the fact that I was someone who had not desired marriage too, so he was comfortable making jokes about it. Mocking it.

But no.... As I said, I'm not the same woman I was 6 years ago. I feel disgusted being with someone who sees marriage as a trap when they don't have a penny to their name and is in debt, because it makes me feel like they don't see a serious future with me. While I desire to be with someone who wants a long term relationship with me--someone to share a life with.

I spoke with him about it tonight. Or at least tried to. As I said, I'm a coward and I never brought up the actual word ""marriage"" even though I wanted to...I asked him if he would be happier without, if he's just staying with me out of some obligation. I told him he should just go back to teaching out of the country or move to wherever he wants to for whatever (because that bit about getting hitched and leaving together was nothing more than a bit).

He told me he didn't want to do that. That he's happy with me, ect. ect. ect.

Then he asked me if I wanted to break up. I went silent, thinking about how I want to be with someone who sees a future with me as their wife... But how I'd feel terrible tossing these 6 years away... That I would be able to find anyone better... My mom's voice ran through my head about how no one would want to stay married to me.

I told him, ""No, I don't want to break up. I'm happy with you,"" and then played Fire Emblem for 2 hours before I started to fake not crying.",19Aug2019,6

I’ve been thinking about what I actually want, and I want to be a YouTuber. It would be something I would genuinely enjoy doing, and if I got a million views per video, I could make a shitload of money. But that’s extremely hard to pull off, so I *have* to have a backup plan.

48,"This is a question I've wondered hard about after coming across a myriad of women-hating incels on here. Like I couldn't wrap my mind around why they were so insistent upon all women being the same (specifically since they agreed all men weren't), and that all females shared traits of expecting men to not be a certain way, never being happy with the ""nice"" guy, etc. I couldn't understand what all of these guys collectively saw in girls that girls couldn't even see in each other.

And then I realized it. The vast majority of them are autistic.

Some people on the spectrum have a particularly hard time reading social cues and sometimes respond in ways that aren't socially conforming. Even when people point it out to them, they can acknowledge what they said but they still can't relate to why it's inappropriate, or how it comes off to others - because it doesn't sound like that in their mind. The women they then get involved with/are interested in start noticing these off-putting comments which become a turn-off. Just as hard as it is for someone who lacks social awareness to relate to someone who in turn is very socially aware, the reverse also applies. A lot of these people don't realize this because to them, if a girl said the same things they say, they'd be overjoyed! It's the same reasoning other type of men send unsolicited dick pictures, because they would be thrilled to get an unsolicited nude from a woman.

The girls that these incels pursue then disengage because they realize they're not on the same wavelength - a feeling that a lot of people on the spectrum don't understand and can't identify, because they lack the social skills needed for it. Because they then don't understand the why, they decide to blame the disinterest from  women on them not liking nice guys (since a lot of these off-putting comments are meant to be complimenting), being turned off when guys do ""nice"" things to them, always looking for assholes, desiring toxic masculinity, etc.  

The lack of empathy and not being able to analyze how their behaviour might be interpreted leads to a misunderstanding in the reasoning behind women's behavior, which then leads to resentment. 

Is my guess.",19Aug2019,2
49,"Yes, I was bullied and yes it made me have trust issues, but we better now. I just want to talk about it because I like reading other people's bullying stories and I have no idea why so like read mine. Anywho It all started when I came to my butt hole school in the first grade.

I was a shy and quiet girl. I sat alone in recess and had no one to talk to, but as a kid that did not bother me at all. I would just crack open a book and read intel recess ended. One day I had to sit next to this girl her name was Alexia and she was nice. Alexia and I became friends and she introduced me to her friend's Crystal, Madison, Ivy and Ella they all seemed nice, but I was wrong. Doing the middle of the school year they would run away from me and always start fights with me for no reason saying I was the one starting drama. I was not really good in those situations I mean I was a 7-years-old I had no idea what I was feeling and I never told my parents about what was going on either. Alexia and crystal would say that I tried to break their friendship. How could I? I was just a kid who wanted to be friends with those guys. They would leave me to sit alone on the bus when we went to field trips and talk behind my back. They made fun of the way I looked and every time I tried standing up for myself they would tell the teacher and cry about it acting like they were the victim. I got in trouble thousands of times because I tried standing up for myself.  This continued to happen intel second grade and I won’t lie I could have just left but they were the gods of the class and I had nowhere else to go.

I was in the second grade and I was still with the same girls but I had a new teacher this time. She actually was the only one who noticed when I sat alone on the bus when we went to field trips. I would try to sit with people, but I am just not the one people would choose to sit with. She tried helping me the best she could. My parents even liked her and I liked her too. Most of the time when I would go to the teachers they all blamed me for being hurt. Every time the girls and I would fight they would go to the teachers and tell on me the second I said something they did not like, but I never told on them because when I did they would get really mad at me. I thought the whole time it was my fault.

Now you'll think that it would end by second grade, but it just got worse. In the third grade, these two new girls Mika and Jayda came to my elementary school they were not that nice and I even got a nickname that year ""obesha"" which means obese and Abisha (my name) together. I was still around the girls from first grade some of them changed and some of them stayed the same. I was known for being ugly and fat and it did not really bother me to be honest because I was no introduced to insecurities at that age. I just stayed with them because I felt like no one would talk to me if I did not talk to them. My confidence was shattered because of them. I was delusional too. They said it was me and I started the drama, but who was the one who made fun of the person’s look and made them feel like they were nothing without the other. I acted fine but I was not. I was actually hurt. I remember I wanted to be partners with Alexia for buddy field day, but so did Mika. At the end of the argument, I wanted to talk to the teachers about Alexia because she was yelling at me. Alexia, of course, became sad and started to cry. My teacher blamed me for wanting to stand up for myself. She told me that it was my fault that nobody wanted to be my partner and that not only made me stay silent it made me feel like I can't get help for my sadness. When it was buddy field day I did end up hanging out with me Alexia since Mika ditched her. I remember Jayda telling me I was ugly one day and I usually ignored it, but that day I started to wonder why I was living. I was not pretty nor was I capable of keeping friends. Wow yeah, I know a 9-year-old thinking suicidal thoughts.

I had no idea that they were even a thing where people would kill themselves but I still had a lingering emotion of wanting to die without even knowing it. I even remember saying I wanted to kill myself without even knowing what it was. My counselor told my mom of course and my mom got pretty upset with me which was not really my intention in making her mad at me. I guess me realizing that I was pathetic kinda not only made me feel worse about myself I felt like there was no way out. Now imagine a 9-year-old girl thinking that she could do no good in the world.

Fourth grade was when I started to act out. I did become friends with this girl but I ended up pushing her away because I felt like I did not deserve any good people in my life. I never did my homework and never really studied for any of my tests. I would get yelled at mostly every day about how I was being irresponsible. I had friends well only one that really was nice to me and her name was Ashlyn. I really was not big on friends because the people I hung out with would leave me out in things and make accusations. I did pass 4th grade which was a surprise, but I still had anger issues, but never really understood the way I felt because I was only 10. There were these two girls that were the new Mika and Jayda there names were Jasmine and Laney.

One day doing gym class Laney made a group with Crystal and some other girl and she did not let me join and at this point, they were chasing me and threatening to hit me. I got really angry and threw a purple squishy ball behind Laney's head. I got in trouble, but all I got was sitting out of P.E witch is like a good thing since I hated P.E anyway.

In fifth grade, it was nothing but drama, but I did do better in school. I met this girl who was a good friend and that's all needed to be honest. I hunged out with her most of the time. I still was being called fat and I recall almost breaking my back at the park, but instead of people helping out they all came around me and made fun of me and they still do to this day. I was on the monkey bars and fell really hard. I was in pain and everyone crowded around me and started to laugh. I started to believe that having friends was not important. I started to get insecurities at that age which made all the words hurt more than usual because I at that time actually started to care about what people thought of me.

I wanted to have a friend that I would grow up in life and have memories with. The only memories I grow up with are people telling me I am not good enough sometimes my mom would make me feel like I was just a burden in life. I  looked like I was ok and I told myself that I was but I was lying to myself I was truly broken in pieces. I seemed ok with all the words they were calling me, but I don’t think they knew that it made me feel like I was a mistake and should not have been born.

I finally left those terrible people at the 6th grade. I ended up making new and good friends their names were McKenna, Emily, Ashlynn, Ryan, Tanner, and Karina. They were nice and we even got along well. I got amazing grades in school and I actually was getting better.  I had good friends and everything was going great until Ashlyn decided to become suicidal. I tried helping her out and tried making her feel better. After that everything went downhill. Mckenna and Emily were keeping secrets from me and we got into many fights. After a while, we stopped talking and I was left all alone. I was furious with Ashlyn because she ditched me all the time even though I tried helping her, in fact, I was the only one who tried helping her.

I became friendly with this girl named Nallisha, but she was not so good to me. She would unfriend me for no reason and come back just to leave me alone again. She would also talk behind my back and call me a freak. I was lonely because everyone was hanging out with them and were on their side. Apparently, everything was my fault and it made me feel very overwhelmed and sad. I was called words by boys on Instagram doing this time too and it made me lash out. They called me a “slut, hoe” and “cunt” everyone seemed to be against me. They even made a whole group chat named ""Abisha is gay"" where all they did in the chat was make fun of me. They Also would spread rumors about my dad molesting me which let me remind you we were 12 years old. Nobody in the group chat helped me and just watched those guys verbally harass me. I was at this point considering to die but I held myself together. I am not saying their bad people, but they did do some mean things. Emily and everyone are good and nice people, but the decisions they made weren't so nice.

Crystal made a killer clown account on Instagram because at that time killer clones were popping. She commented on one of my posts saying that I was ugly and that she would kill me.  I did now know it was her intel she changed her account to a spam account.

One day I was getting my clarinet for the band class and when I walked in the room a bunch of girls were making fun of my laugh. They were making a facial expression of a disfigured person. Finally one of the girls saw me and she tried to say sorry, but I shut her down and that girl was Ivy.

At the end of the year, 6th graders got to go to a pool party and I was in the corner all alone not talking to anybody. No one came to get a picture with me for graduation and no one talked to me. I was not even invited to birthday parties and when I invited people every year no one would come. I had no friends at my birthday parties to talk to. I never had a sleepover nor did I have friends period.",19Aug2019,2

53,"Hey, am I the only person (F, 22) who gets extremely emotional and starts crying when things can happen differently than you expected?
For example, when I talk about a topic with one person and I say one thing I am sure is true, and the other person contradicts me or doesn't believe me, and I repeat that I am sure of what I say, because I have documented very well on the subject, but the other is still contradicting me. At times like this I can't really calm down and start crying, probably because of frustration.
Or another example: today is my mother's day, but my parents are in one city, and I am in another, because I can go home only in a few days. Usually, every year, I was the one in charge to buy the gift for the mother, because Dad was never the kind of man to make presents. However, this year, when I'm gone, I thought he will take care to buy at least one bouquet of flowers as a symbolic gift.
However, I found out that he did not do this and instantly I began to cry, without being able to calm myself too easily. 
And there can be many other examples, in new situations that I have to deal with, I am extremely anxios, I am about to cry or to lose my temper.. and in those moments I really need to speak with someone that believes and calms me, usually my best friend. 
Anyway, I wanted to know if anyone else is facing situations like this, or what do you think about it? 
Also, I was in therapy some time ago and I talked about it, but there were much more serious problems that I had to solve, so i neglected this aspect.",19Aug2019,7
54,"I would really like some outside perspective on a work problem that is causing me a huge degree of anxiety. This is really long. 

I do a very specialised job in an understaffed 3-person department. We are looking to hire, but it's a long and difficult process. 

I was hired at the same time as John at the same level, under a boss, Jane. Last week, both John and Jane got a promotion, but not me. 

I have had a few performance issues mentioned in feedback because I'm not amazing at time management, and my clients are some of the more difficult ones. But I work long hours and weekends, because I want to do excellent work I'm confident in, and succeed. I'm very conscientious. I get some great client feedback, I'm known as being particularly good at certain job elements, and work I've led has just been nominated for many awards. But still, I can be slower compared to others and I can have a short temper. At our monthly one-on-ones I ask Jane if she has any feedback for me to work on and she always says I'm doing well. In the meeting where I was told about the promotions, the big boss, Jethro, made a throwaway comment about wanting to employ someone else like me. I've never been told 'You're falling behind John' or anything like that. 

Long story short, I know I have a bit to work on before I can truly be proud of myself, so I accepted that I'm not ready to be promoted, and vowed to work harder. 

The next day a work party was held, partially to celebrate John and Jane. I happily offered my sincere congratulations to both of them, and John told me we needed to talk.

We'd all been drinking (me especially!) and John told me his previous company had tried to entice him back a title bump and payrise, so he went to Jane. He said he had mentioned wanting a promotion to her at his one-on-ones but was told no, only recently. As I said, we are very short staffed, so John told me the company made a hurried decision to match the other company's offer and retain him. This would have put John on the same level as Jane, so they also promoted her to maintain the hierarchy.

Management doesn't know that John told me this.  It initially made me feel better to hear it, but now I'm a bit upset at the lack of transparency. Jane and others always tell me I need to be more confident in my own work. I'm pretty hurt right now, but I can't help feeling that maybe the assumption was that I would internalise the idea that I suck and assume this was a performance-based decision, when that's clearly not the full story. There was no 'We promoted John because xxx, you need to work on yyy' feedback given to me.  I currently feel quite belittled by the fact my employer doesn't feel like it was worth telling the truth to me, instead, letting me sit with the notion that I'm just not very good or appreciated, which may ultimately lead to me going elsewhere. Is that what they want? I don't know and it's making me really sad.

60,"I'm in my last year of high school (doing IB). I really don't know what the cause of the problem is here.

1. Since summer, I have been unable to sleep even if I feel exhausted. The thing is, I would put down my essays and everything because I'm tired and want to go to bed, but once I'm in bed I can't sleep. I feel like it's such a waste of my time but I'm not attentive enough to get back up and do work.
2. For the past 2 weeks or so, every day when it gets to about 4pm, my body just shuts down. This is horrible. On many days of the week I have sports training at night and it gets so bad that I either have to cancel it to take a nap or chug a red bull, and I'd still be tired after that. It gets to the point where I just feel like absolute crap and I can't do any work. However, I feel completely fine in the morning when I go to school—I'm perfectly awake and functioning.

Is this a sleep issue—should I see a sleep specialist? Or is it because in the afternoon I'm suffering from a caffeine crash (I have coffee in the morning) or a sugar drop after lunch?

Could this also be the result of my new…Juul habit? I used to smoke (about a pack every 3 weeks, so barely) but during summer I discovered the Juul and have quit smoking since, but I now Juul regularly (more often than I used to smoke)? I've read that nicotine is a stimulant and makes it difficult to sleep, so I put down the Juul around 1-2 hours before going to bed—would it still have an effect?",19Aug2019,2

65,"We all create the criteria of our perfect boyf or girlfriend from when we're young, and often never forget these fantasies even if we know it's illogical and naive to expect a person fitting our pre-existing perfect standard to exist.

Even if a green-eyed, left-handed, French-speaking girl is alive somewhere, among 7 billion people it's an absurd notion that I may actually meet them.

And if by some miracle, against all odds, she actually does exist, not only within meeting distance but within my existing circle of friends, it would be foolish to assume we'd be compatible on any real emotional level. She could just as easily be a green-eyed leftie bitch.

Well, this girl exists. I've wanted a ""green-eyed, left-handed French girl"" at least since my early teens. She exists, within my circle of friends, and shares innumerable qualities with me, with specifically similar personalities and an effortless rapport with one another. She enjoys the herb as much as I do, plays the same game as I regularly use to unwind, hears colour in sounds, has a love of animals... just about anything. My perfect girl exists, against unfathomable odds, and with time spent together over the past year I have developed an enormous crush, even disregarding the fact that she fits my teenage-self's perfect-girl criteria.

69,"I'm very young, I turned 19 just two months ago. About 1,5 years ago I met my current girlfriend. A lot happened in all those months and now she's one of the people I love the most. I'm not just in love, I  love her. I can't even imagine a life without her, and she's an amazing girlfriend in all ways. 

The only problem is her mental health. She has a few mental health problems such as depression and an eating disorder, and has attempted suicide more than once in the past before meeting me. She's still sick and although she's better than she was like 2 years ago, she says she can't promise me that she'll never try to kill herself again, but that she'll do her best to prevent it. She's already in therapy but it doesn't seem to be helping enough. Now I'm, more or less constantly, living with this fear that she'll either kill herself or that her eating disorder will kill her. 

I feel trapped and I'm afraid that this have ruined my life. I love her as if she had been with me my whole life, she feels like family to me now. I literally love her so much and I don't want to let her go, but even if I did I'd still love and worry about her. And because I love her, I have days and weeks where I'm so afraid. Right now I can't stop crying and I'm feeling so depressed because I feel like no matter what I do, I'm so trapped and my life will be ruined no matter what I do:

Stay with her? Two possible outcomes: Either I'm gonna suffer for a long time until she becomes 100% healthy and I can stop worrying , or she'll kill herself and leave me with a grief and sorrow that I will NEVER get over.

Leave her? I'll still love her and keep worrying. Besides, if I ever find out that she did kill herself, I would also feel extremely guilty. 

Tears are running down my face, thinking about how I might be giving all my days, love and life to someone who might just end up killing herself. I love her and want to be with her, but I just wish things were normal. I know that our relationship isn't exactly normal and sometimes very unhealthy. I wish she felt better and I wouldn't have to feel so scared and trapped that I sometimes want to kill myself. Because I know that no matter if I break up with her or stay with her, I would be crushed if she'd die. Because she's someone I love as if she were family.

1,5 years ago I had a pretty normal life except for a few problems. Now I have started to have suicidal thoughts. I feel so trapped and sometimes I just want to end my life because I don't know what to do. I know I sound dramatic, but this is how I feel.

73,"So, my mom went to a doctor for abdominal pain and the Doctor said that my mom has a hernia and she needs to get surgery. This was a month or two back and she hasn't done anything about it. 

Today she screamed while she was walking and fell over. I went over and asked her about it but she immediately insisted she was fine and said that she was going to go to the hospital ""when she got around to it."" I'm a (new) EMT, and in school they taught us just enough about medicine to determine whether or not someone needs to go to a hospital. I think that while she could have a reducible hernia (which can wait years before treatment), she also might have a worse one (especially because the pain was right over her femoral artery) and I'm worried that her condition might worsen. 

I told her she should go to the hospital and she said that ""I'm taking myself to seriously"" and that ""I don't know what I'm talking about."" She refused a dozen times. Later, I told my stepdad, and he went ""Yeah alright, Doctor"" sarcastically.

It lasted a total of 45 seconds or so before it let go. For some reason i didnt panic and just concentrated on breaking free. So yeah, it scared the fuck outa me.
 Anyone else have this happen to them. If so how do you break free?
 Should i see my doctor about this?
 Fyi. I take amatryptalin at night ( i didnt take any that night as i fell asleep on the couch)
 I also take lyrica during the day. I reaserched my meds better but never really found anything about sleep paralysis

79,"I've had a lot of friends come and go through the years (I'm a female in my late twenties), and I've never had much of an issue being on my own. Until now.

My current best friend and I met at work a few years ago. We became close mostly because we worked the same shifts together everyday. We started hanging out on the weekends, then it progressed to doing things together every night after work (talking on the phone, online gaming, watching movies, etc.).  In the last year I could count how many days we didn't talk to each other on maybe two hands.

I know it's unhealthy to place such an importance on one single person (especially someone who I'm not even in a relationship with), but I can't help but feel so sad and empty now. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that he *was* my life. I very rarely did anything without him, and just about everything I looked forward to involved him in some way. 

I'm immensely excited for him and his new opportunities, but I don't wanna move on. I don't wanna make new friends. I just want what I had.

82,"My mother thinks our neighbors are trying to destroy the coconut tree in our house. Everyday she comes up with a new theory on how they are doing it. I try to handle it by acting on her suspicion so that she will be at peace but nothing helps. 
First she thought they are stealing the coconuts so I removed the coconuts even the unriped once. Then she thought they will burn the tree by pouring acid in the soil as a revenge, so I covered it with plastic sheet and remove it only while watering. Then she thought they are spraying some medicine on the trunk of the tree, so we covered it with plastic, now she is saying they are spraying it higher. 
It just hurts me she is going through all this pain for one fucking coconut tree. 
I provided her proofs that nothing is wrong with the tree but she is not ready to believe me. She says that I don’t support her.
I love my mother a lot and it breaks my heart when I see her standing in the window at middle of the night. She sleeps 2 hours a day. I told her the tree is not worth her health but she is not ready to listen. I will be installing CCTV cameras as one more solution to her suspicion. With the cost of CCTV cameras I can buy the coconuts for 20 years, but she is not ready for any rationale discussion.

83,So basically my best friend got really into casual drinking and smoking and I want her to be safe (because a lot of things can happen and I’m constantly worried about her wellbeing because she means so much to me) so when she goes out/feels like drinking I go with her and pretend I like drinking [certain type of liquor] because I don’t want to go out and make her feel bad for the fact that she’s the only one drinking and alcohol doesn’t really have that much of a effect on me. If I tell her a lot of times that I’m worried and that I’m really concerned about her getting addicted and I just want her to be safe and not be the annoying friend that doesn’t want to do anything mildly fun.

89,"I graduated a few months ago with a Bachelor’s degree in a business field in NYC. I’ve submitted about 500 online applications in the past few months, but I haven’t gotten any job offers. I’ve interviewed at 3 places, but each time I’ve been told after the interview that there are actually no positions available and they’ll let me know if one opens up.

I just finished my (second) unpaid internship and I’m running out of savings to live off of. I think I can last another month, then I won’t be able to pay rent anymore. I don’t have any family I can move in with. I really don’t know what to do anymore. I’m 28 and I feel like I should’ve been able to get a real salaried job by now. I can’t help but feel worthless since no employer thinks I’m worth hiring.

All of my friends have professional jobs with living wages and they tell me it shouldn’t be that hard to get a job with my degree and skillset. It seems like they have it so easy - many of them are younger than me, work from home (doing nothing) 2+ days per week, and earn 6 figures. I just don’t know why I’m struggling so much.

I’m frustrated that I’ve been working my butt off for nothing. What was the point of throwing away tens of thousands of dollars and wasting 10 years to get a degree that’s proven to be useless? What’s the point of working for free as an intern if the experience won’t help me get a job somewhere? The internship was actually advertised as a paid internship when I applied, but after I accepted the role, I was informed that it was actually unpaid and that there was a mistake in the job posting.

Every day I wake up wanting to kill myself. I feel worthless, I have no purpose, and I no longer find joy in life. I don’t know how much longer I can afford to live. I have $15k in credit card debt in addition to $30k in student loans. I feel crushed and there’s no light at the end of the tunnel.",19Aug2019,2

102,Hello everyone so I was in my first relationship. We were both 17 when we started dating and after a month started to make out. Eventually we graduated to the next level and started to do oral. I had just turned 18 when we did it for the first time and she was two weeks away from being 18. We eventually broke up and that ended pretty horribly. Now we started to get in touch again before we go off to our respective colleges. Something that popped into my head was that she was still a minor when we did that. So now I’m freaking out that I’m legally a criminal and I feel horrible about myself. I don’t know what to think cause people even her tell me that im a good person but I still can’t get it out of my head that I’m this horrible monster. I already have had problems with suicidal thoughts and this is only fire to the flame because I think I’m this horrible thing.

My sister has a tick where she feels the need to repeat anything my mom does (cough, sneeze, pull up her pants, etc), to the point where my mom cannot do anything without having this happen to her.

(Before I start: my native language is not English, so please accept my mistakes or strange phrasing)

So... I can't really explain why have I registered and why am I writing, maybe just because writing about my life helps me get som thins out of my system. Or maybe it is just attention seeking, due to being lonely, I don't know. Anyway, I'm the kind of person who always overthinks everything, from the small things like what should I buy for lunch, what possibilites should I expect when packing my backpack before leaving home, to the larger things like how fair is life, what is my purpose,  how should I feel about my situation, how could I be happy and satisfied with what ""I got"". Basically, these latter questions are the point of this post, but let me introduce myself first, so you get a glimpse of my life and my feelings. (Maybe I could post to r/depression too, but that could be another discussion.)

I'm about 30, male, living in Hungary. I don't remember much from my childhood, but after going to primary school, I got bullied by some classmates, which lasted for about 2-3 years. They just liked to make fun of me, and I wasn't someone who would stand up and defend himself, I just let them continue and hoped they would get bored after a time. As a child, I couldn't really handle that situation better. Meanwhile, I was a great student, attending competitions in Maths and Grammar, but my self-esteem and courage got to a pretty low level. I started the 5th grade in another, better school, but soon, I found myself bullied again. I can't recall how or when it started, but I sweat more than the average person, and the main problem is that my palms get sweaty sometimes for no reason but everytime I am nervous. And because of that, none of my classmates wanted to shake or hold my hand if there was a situation where it was needed, also my feet had a really bad smell which everyone could ""feel"" when we had PE lessons and had to change clothes. It lasted about a year when the PE teacher one time mentioned to the whole class that whoever may be the source of the smell obviously does not change socks everyday - that's when I learned that normally, a person should wear clean t-shirts, underpants and socks everyday and not wear them for a week. Also that it is better to have a shower at least every 1-2 days, not just once-twice a week - I had some ""nice"" parenting, as you can see... 

Speaking of whom, my parents had a nice one family house in the beginning, once they decided to extend it becuase by that time, I had 3 siblings. But the house got so big that they could not afford to pay the bills anymore and the loan they used for the building operations, so they had to sell the house, we lost a lot of money, and had to rent a house instead. Neither of them could manage the financials well, my mother had health issues and haven't really worked for a long time, my father had a steady job for a while but was smoking and drinking. This caused him to loose one of his legs due to his circulation breaking down, then he lost nearly all willingness to live, just drank more and were getting angry all the time, especially when he didn't have any cigarettes. They divorced too because as my mother said, she didn't want any financial problem of my father to affect the rest of us, but later she told us once that she hadn't even loved him, just married him because she thought she couldn't find anyone better and he seemed good enough - that was a nice little gut punch feeling again. She wanted to have the divorce papers, but we all lived together even after that, when we moved to a new house (also renting it). My dad got really bitter, did not change his lifestyle, and as a result, a couple years ago he died in some illness. 

My mother seemed to be able to manage the financials at the time, but it turned out she never really planned anything, me and my siblings had to overcome some things ourselves or make some sacrifices, for example not going to parties with classmates because we couldn't spare money to buy a drink. There were some really low points in our life in those 10 years, starting from about a year before selling the house... Like usually, at the end of the month, the fridge was nearly empty for 1-2 days before we got some money. Once, I had to go to donating blood not becasue I wanted to but because we get about 2$ for it and I spent that immeadiately, to buy something to make lunch from at home... I was about 18 when at one point, in that 3rd house, when we got behind with the bills, because the money went ""who knows where"", we, the children decided to take over the financial planning, and from then, mostly I did the calculating, trying to figure out how to pay so many things from such small income (some allowance due to her being a widow and us being half orphans). In the meantime, before that, in high school, I got some friends finally, because I was nice and helpful all the time, but I could never and still can't initiate a conversation or maintain one, I've always been shy and felt myself ""out of place"" and lonely.

Once my older sibling and I went to the university, we had to get student loans and spent about 2/3 of those money to just everyday living and bills. I have still about 7000$ to pay back...  Soon after, we moved to a 4th location, where we could live a little better due to the loans, and the occasional scholarships. I still live here with my mother and one of my siblings, the others found their partners and moved out after a while. Evaluating the last couple years, I can't really complain, because I got a good job that I like, I earn enough money to get by without immoderate sparing which was common beforehand. I still cannot save much money, only a little, month by month, but at least it's something. Sometimes I can afford to pay the others some money for vacation, or any other ""not so everyday"" thing they need. Still, I feel like this is far from the ideal situation, I can't move out without much more money saved, I have to support my mother because I'm the breadwinner now, so I don't really have options or possibilites. She's just waiting for winning the lottery, and dreaming what she would do with so much money, but I've already accepted that we have to work for our situation to get better. We've always managed to get by, to get over some extremely difficult positions, but that was becasue we did everything in our power and hoped for the best or some help from up above (I was raised a catholic). Even so, I don't know how to feel about growing up so early, and being so lonely.

I mean, if I think about it, we are right now in an acceptable situation, it may be somewhere below average in our country, not having a house and many possessions. That's the basic observation, and from there, my mind starts wondering. I often envy those who has everything handed for them, not caring about how much money they spend. Not in a way that I would like having what they have and want them having nothing instead, just the same opportunities and possibilites, being able to not think about the financials even when going to a shop to buy food for the week. But, I don't know and can't know how much they deserve their wealth, if for example one of their ancestors worked really hard to provide them with this life, of if they are just lucky, or there are some illegal activities in the background. However, there are many people in worse situations in our country too, like the ones who live in poverty in small houses which don't even have running water, where the children wear raunchy clothes, and they can't go the normal schools becuase there are none near where they live. Or when I hear or read in the news that someone's home burnt down and they don't have anything left. Or thinking about outside our country, in the world, where there are even worse places, I guess you all can imagine some.

So, I don't really know what to do or how to deal with this. Can I complain that I experienced some bad shit during the years, and I still have many problems? Did I deserve all the negative memories I got? Or should I be happy that it is at least better than for many other people? Who am I to judge anybody about how they spend their money if they have so much? How to move forward from here? How can I just enjoy life? Am I even allowed to do that while many other people suffer? Am I selfish if I want to be happy? How should I manage to not think about all these, for tens of minutes or even 1-2 hours on many days of a week? :/

Thank you if you've read this, I don't really expect answers, just wrote because it felt right, I guess...",19Aug2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

Theres a character that i consider to be a really good villain called Lord Shen who had a large amount of backstory that never made it into the films but is confirmed canon by Dreamworks.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently Villain films have been picking up in popularity. And Kung Fu Panda has had the story officially end for Po but 3 more films are planned. And apart from sausage party no adult 3d animated films have been made yet.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea is that a trilogy on Lord Shen gets made that is pretty dark with some sad moments and happy exploring into the characters life leading up the the second film. The idea of this film is to appeal to the audience that originally seen Kung Fu Panda 1 and 2 who are now 8-10 years older which is a pretty large amount.

&amp;#x200B;

Theres a tons more i can talk about on this idea but i want to keep this super short. Tell me if this is a good idea and what you think or tell me this is a bad idea.",19Aug2019,2
118,"I’m heartbroken (cringe to start it off like that, I know!) but not because of a boyfriend, because a friendship ended due to me ignoring all the red flags. I ignored them because I’ve never opened up to someone like this before, never been this close to someone, never found someone so easy to talk to so I figured they were just small things and focused on growing the friendship. I’ve now ended up with trust issues and low self-esteem. 

I started talking to this guy and he was just the nicest and funniest guy, now he just calls me an idiot, a hoe and purposely does things that hurt me.  He said he lost the “caring” feelings. I still think to this day how? He finally started talking about his family to me so I opened up to him about my family and the stuff I had to deal with. I still think if that was the thing that drove him away? He said I was too needy but really who says that to a friend? My expectations were you’d be there for someone through the good and the bad. Maybe I was wrong. 

We liked each other, romantically and sexually and we tend to not talk about the former. He didn’t want to be committed to me but he had no problems expressing to me that he may date other people in the future and even pushed me to see other people as well. This made me very angry because my last relationship didn’t go well. I played a part in it too but I don’t blame anyone but myself. Side note: he once said his brother has been with more attractive women than the woman he married. Sometimes my insecurity thinks maybe he doesn’t wanna be with me because I’m not white or maybe I’m not attractive enough? Only he knows but I’ll never get that out of him. 

Whenever I wanted to make plans with him it was like pulling teeth. In the end he said I forced him to plan the holiday next year. I’m confused because I asked him to say yes or no. It was an ultimatum because he kept avoiding it and I only wanted to spend time with him. He obviously had no intentions to and was probably never planning on going. The whole thing was just him stringing me along, that’s how I feel after he’s broken his promise. He made me so hopeful and now I’m so distraught. 

I just wanna keep this short but I came to a realization last night that I was used. I keep going back to that time we were talking about being together and he said no. He told me that he stayed because he “needed” me, he stayed because he needed his friend. The friendship was mostly on his terms and whenever I “needed” something, it always caused an argument if he didn’t want it. There was that one time I did something so stupid that he didn’t talk to me for 2 weeks. When we last talked, he said he never should’ve talked to me after what I did. That hurts because after everything that’s happened he just wish it never happened at all?

After he stopped talking to me, I went to this support group kind of thing and I met 3 people who were very easy to talk to but I got scared to get close to other people, I stopped talking to them. Throughout writing this I keep getting reminded of the things he did to hurt me. I’m never gonna forget that and being called an idiot. I just can’t believe someone like that would call me names. I’ve ignored red flags so I’m most likely a fucking idiot, no I’m definitely an idiot. I am human though and I still reminisce the good memories. 


There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think about him and I feel like it’s gonna be like this for awhile. I’ve chosen to be alone because I’m legit terrified to be vulnerable to another human being ever again. 

If you read this, I don’t really need advice I just wanted to get this off my chest.",19Aug2019,1
