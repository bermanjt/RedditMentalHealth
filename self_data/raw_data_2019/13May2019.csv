2,"This post is pretty much about me just ranting sooo.. yeah.. I kinda miss my ex but at the same time I don‚Äôt? Idk if that makes sense. We were impossibly similar in every way possible, we laughed about the stupidest things, made fun of each other, etc. we used to literally talk 24/7 if we weren‚Äôt face to face we‚Äôd be texting. Lmao we made up this weird ass thing where we‚Äôd talk ONLY in gifs it‚Äôd go on for like a hour. We‚Äôd do this ‚Äúrate‚Äù thing where I‚Äôd give her pictures of ppl to rate and she‚Äôd do the same. 

I think there‚Äôs one thing that made her in particular more ‚Äúspecial ‚Äú and y to this day still think about her. So, my parents are always fighting and shit and since I was little I was like ‚Äúfuck love &amp; marriage‚Äù parents thought it was a phase but teens rolled up and nope same mindset. High school came up and never had a gf. I just didn‚Äôt see the point in dating if I wasn‚Äôt looking for marriage. So, I met her and at first it was like ‚Äúsup‚Äù ‚Äúhi‚Äù -poke- -pokes back- lmao but eventually I started falling for her after she‚Äôd fallen for me like 4 months prior. At some point we both knew we liked each other but I was too ‚Äúscared‚Äù to admit it to myself and she got to working on trying to convince me to date. Lmfao I‚Äôd be so bad with her I knew she wanted to date (meant a lot to her) and I‚Äôd me like ‚Äúso I was thinking &amp;... would you be my gf?‚Äù And she‚Äôd get all excited and I‚Äôd be like ‚ÄúNOT‚Äù &amp; I‚Äôd crack up lmao this happened like once- twice a day for 5ish months. After a while I finally caved and just said yes to her asking me. There‚Äôs the thing though (which is why this always fucks me up when I think about it) we BOTH thought ID be the one to cheat. I was always the fuck boy type but nope that didn‚Äôt happen. &amp; she was always the one with the ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt cheat‚Äù bs jfjdnfjwjdnsjfbdndkdjfn 

But ye. After we started dating we dated for like 3 years and we had known each other for 2 years before that. 

The break up was definitely ugly. 3 day thing where I literally went from being 100% into her to going into the negatives. Holy fuck after 5 years I was still in the ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù stage then for that to go into the negatives. K well, she cheated and somehow turned into the complete opposite of what I loved about her. She used to be humble af (like you have no idea) (she was rich) to being a complete brat. Etc. 

Omg idk how to say this or how to even start so, she had this best friend named ‚Äúerica‚Äù they were so close throughout high school but once in college Erica went in the opposite direction(was on track to becoming a nurse but turned to hard drugs) and as you can probably imagine, her friends became my friends so she meant a lot to me and we both tried to pull her back into reality. She never came back to where she was. A few months after we (btw let‚Äôs call her shay) stopped talking Erica texted me and I was really surprised. She asked me ‚Äúplease take shay back‚Äù because apparently no one (from her old friends) liked the person who she had become. I didn‚Äôt. 

Tbh by how much she changed in those 3 days and considering everything I think it might‚Äôve been a mental breakdown (she was going through some family shit) I‚Äôve texted her like 2x since we broke up (idk go long it‚Äôs been prob like 1-2 years?) just to see if she‚Äôs back to normal and nope.. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôve never dated since her sooo..",13May2019,2

4,"I always wanted to try KFC, but heard too many stories of ppl getting sick, pictures of raw sandwiches, etc.

food poisoning rarely kills you, unless you're old or immunocompromised or something like that.

I had a one-day case of salmonella from undercooked turkey when I was 8. it was more traumatizing due to being young, and the fact that I woke up at 4 AM with a severe stomach ache and threw up in a pitch black room. after that I had severe germophobia and had a ruined childhood because of panic attacks every time i got a little stomach ache or gas. the phobia got milder over time, and interestingly my intense fear of puking morphed into a combination of vomit fetish (which helped cancel out the fear) and still some phobia. yeah i have a huge complex/obsession with puking. i think i could handle puking nowadays if i could do it in the comfort of my shower, but i recently panicked because of indigestion on vacation and hate to puke in a random restroom.

as i've gotten older, i've started to hate the idea of allowing the fear of pain to control what i do. like, i'm not letting some stupid evil bacteria control me, or else they win.  i think maybe if you enjoy a food, then the risk of food poisoning is worth it. And don't say not to eat it, because everything has a risk of food poisoning, unless you only eat canned foods and home-cooked food.

i don't think food poisoning is too bad if you can spend the duration in the comfort of a warm shower.",13May2019,1

I'm on my last leg, if you check my post history you'll see that I'm dying. I'm not looking for pity so let me just make that clear I'M NOT LOOKING FOR PITY. I lost a fight with booze and I'm paying for it now.  
  
I don't really know when I'm going to kick the bucket because I've already outlived my expectancy.

I post something on my snapchat or Instagram story and automatically feel uneasy about it and usually end up deleting it in a few minutes to an hour.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping someone who has experienced a similar problem can share how they stopped caring and what caused them to stop caring whether it be a piece of advice or a mindset. I would also love book or podcast recommendations on this subject of how to stop caring what people think. I know there is temptation to say, ""just stop caring"" but it isn't that easy for me.

17,"I was in a coma last year. My heart stopped twice while I was still under.  
  
I had been drinking from the moment I woke up until I went to bed at night for the better part of 15 years.  
  
I did well for myself during that time. I had a career in finance, I worked my way up the corporate ladder. Bought the nice house, condos, cars, toys etc. I had a lovely SO, great friends, great relationship with my family.  
  
I had done what I set out to do in life. All while holding this terrible secret that I never wanted to exist. I was never good enough for myself, I never felt deserving of what I had. I hid that feeling deep down inside, never letting it come to surface.  
  
I found whiskey and fell in love. It made that feeling go away. Knowing that it was poison wasn't ever enough to make me stop. It never interfered in my life. I never got in trouble, never got drunk and started a fight, never cheated, never appeared drunk at work.  
  
And then last year came. I was induced into a coma after contracting jaundice. I was induced into a coma and because of the withdrawals my heart stopped twice.  
  
I was very vocal in the past about that if anything should happen to me I DO NOT WANT TO BE RESUSCITATED. Well they did it twice... And it bothers me so much.  
  
Since I've woken up I have lost my SO (she didn't like me sober and found the sight of all of my newly acquired scars disgusting)    
  
I try to stay sober but keep fucking it up leaving to both of my younger brothers to loose faith in me as a positive influence.  
  
I can't work anymore.  
  
I'm in a constant state of pain.  
  
And I'm lonely.  
  
I didn't want to come back. Dying last year would have been a release. I tried to off myself once last November but couldn't go through with it... Mom would be sad.  
  
I'm rambling. I'm sorry. I'm just tired and lonely.",13May2019,3
18,"My grandpa died about 6 years ago. Me and him were incredibly close and eerily similar. He‚Äôs the one who I wanted to be at my graduation(high school and college), my wedding, and whatever else I was going to do in my life that was a huge milestone. 

It killed me inside to see him deteriorate from cancer. He got surgery to remove the tumor, he had no signs of other cancerous spots, and he refused to go through chemo afterwards because he didn‚Äôt want to go through it. I understand his reasoning for not going through chemo, I‚Äôd probably do the same. 

The cancer came back and spread to his lungs and liver. Once it came back, it hit him hard. I saw this strong guy with a powerful voice just fall apart. He had to get a feeding tube, and eventually became incoherent and couldn‚Äôt take care of himself. When I visited him in his hospital room you could just smell the cancer. It was tough to stay in the room for long periods of time because of that smell but he was the most relaxed around me so I stayed and kept him company. 

He died shortly after with the help of hospice

After he died, I was in denial. I didn‚Äôt believe he died. I never saw the body and I never saw him die in front of me. I was 14 years old and wasn‚Äôt allowed to go be with him in his final moments. 

I went to his funeral without crying, and whenever I went over to my grandmothers house I‚Äôd look for him to be sitting in his chair. When I saw that it was empty I figured he was out on another business trip and he‚Äôd bring me back a cool gift as he usually did. But he never came back. Because he was dead. 

I finally accepted his death last year. I should‚Äôve gone to grief counseling but I didn‚Äôt think I needed it. But now that I realized he is in fact dead, I probably should. I mean, I lost my best friend. The only person I could truly relate to. 

After my grandpa died my grandma‚Äôs narcissistic tendencies started to show up. Everybody else could handle being around her, but I hate her with a passion. I figured it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt want to deal with her acting that way around me but honestly, she‚Äôs not that bad of a narcissist. She‚Äôs a lonely old women who guilt trips people so she has someone to talk to. But I still hate her with a passion. 

The other day, my grandma and my mom were talking. My grandma said that she thinks I‚Äôm acting like a jerk towards her because she should‚Äôve been the one to die, not my grandpa. 

My mom told me it and suddenly my hatred of her made sense. I felt like the wrong grandparent died. My best friend and grandpa was ripped from me and I felt so alone and all that I was left with was a crazy, lonely, old woman. 

Even though my grandmas narcissist tendencies shouldn‚Äôt be ignored, it‚Äôs wrong of me to basically punish her for being the one to live by being a huge jerk to her. I‚Äôm taking my anger out on her because my grandpa is gone. He‚Äôs not going to tell me all his stories, he‚Äôs not going to be there to see me be the first girl in my family to even go to college, and he‚Äôs not there to see me grow as a person. And I‚Äôm taking it all out on my grandma....",13May2019,7
19,"Girlfriend broke up with me and I'm trying to handle the situation as gracefully as possible. She had a messy breakup before and I love her too much to put her through any emotional pain. 

For context she explained that I didn't do anything wrong and that she still cared for me, but other personal issues make it difficult for her to pursue a relationship right now. I get that this sounds like ""letting someone down easy"", but we talked about this and I really believe and trust her reasons.

What I'm struggling with right now is I don't know how to deal with my emotions. I still love her, but know there is no way we will be together again. I've moved past the stage of hoping we could get back together.

I know and understand that I can find other things, and eventually someone else that will make me happy. But they won't make me happy for the same reasons she made me happy.

I want to be able to look back on the memories I had with my girlfriend fondly, I really don't have any reason to be upset with her. Right now though, all those memories just make me sad and lonely.

I don't want to suppress and bury away with my feelings. Is it possible to move on without forgetting? Does anyone have any general advice?

Especially because I keep setting my alarm earlier and waking up earlier only for her to rush to the bathroom first.

What's worse is that she doesnt even leave for work before I do and spends twice as long in the bathroom than I do. She will get up at, say, 6.15 and not leave until 9. I will get up at 6.15 and leave by 7. Still, she gets priority in her mind.

24,"Currently I'm on my second pack, but not until stoke number thirty-five did I enjoyed my first cigarette. I thought thats what I'd been doing this whole time ‚Äì‚Äì my impression was clearly quite wide of the mark. Once I mastered how to take a drag without allowing myself to utterly choke, I realize that this is how a cigarette is meant to be consumed. As I inhale attentively I direct the smoke into my lungs to then let out a smooth, clean, and satisfying current. The wings of my soul fluttered and traveled to their very own Lake of Shining Waters. We spend so much of our time and energy trying to achieve physical euphoria: hiking, rock climbing, or perhaps a thrilling ride at a theme park. Anything that might give us rush or adrenaline. But little do we know that we can access mental euphoria, where the scenic views of hiking don't require an actual hike. The images can be painted for us in the peace of our subliminal self. Entailing me to travel no further than the patio my backyard, I think this was a convenient trip for a rousing buzz. The indicator that ‚Äì despite the others I've smoked ‚Äì this was the first one that I had truly enjoyed was a light spell of laughter that came as a result.

26,"I've been aware of this self image for a while I just don't know why it took so long to acknowledge it. My self esteem is so low it mind as well be non existant. I look in the mirror and see an unlovable person who isn't worth anything. As I said before, I've been aware of this lowly image of myself that I cannot shake no matter what attempts I make, however I've always dismissed the idea of truly not liking myself as me being coincided or narcissistic; obsessive over some unrealistic concept of myself... which only added to further my self dislike. 
Past experiences only help to reinforce and help build this self image. I've never been anyone's first choice, I've always been the person you'd settle for. I've been cheated on in every relationship (always with an ex boyfriend or a new, cuter, impulse) and I've even tried to analyze and improve on myself as I'd assume such consistency in my relationships was a bigger reflection on me than them.. which of course added to this opinion of myself. The thing is, I've been told I'm not a bad looking guy. That I'm a good guy who works hard and should be proud of where I am in life right now... but I just cannot believe that. That's not what I see when I look at myself in the mirror (literally and figuratively). All I see is someone who has never had their love truly reciprocated in any relationship... even one that lasted multiple years. I just... I don't understand why I've never had someone choose me... they settle, then leave... and now I feel that I agree with their decisions. I don't know what to do to fix this.

27,"Many people probably won't read this because who cares about someone else's love life. I just need to write this out. 

I just woke up from a dream where I confessed my love to my friend and she reciprocated by doing the same. I've had multiple similar dreams, but even more so lately. They usually happen after talking to her or interacting with her in any way. The main problem with this is that I'm in a 4 year relationship. 

I first met Maria in eighth grade when she immediately caught my eye as the new girl in class. We never really talked for a couple reasons: I felt she was out of my league and I never strayed far from my small social circle. While I had other love interests, she was always at the forefront. When we graduated I thought I'd never see her again since we would be going to different high schools and our group of friends didn't overlap. 

I believe it was halfway through my freshman year when I heard a rumor that she would be coming to my school. A rush of memories and feelings came with the news. I eagerly talked to her friend, inquiring if whether or not the rumor was true. She confirmed it was, and asked why I cared. The truth was written all over my face and whatever blundering answer I came up with didn't matter. I believe Maria's friend told her about that moment and my obvious facade because when I saw Maria just days later she had a knowing look.

Prefacing, during the summer after graduation I started suffering from depression, which still plagues me as a 22 year old. 

I don't know what I did or said but Maria noticed that I was depressed or that something was bothering me. She provided a shoulder to lean on and allowed me to vent. This was weird as she was crossing social boundaries. We didn't talk much before this and her doing this said a lot about who she was and it resonated with me. This would be the foundation of our friendship I believe. 

She pushed me into going to speak to our guidance counselor and eventually I hesitantly agreed. The talks I would go on to have with Mrs.  Hosten would be overall fruitless but I could see that she genuinely cared for me. 

Maria would go on to be just my support system slowly. We'd talk of things unrelated to the aforementioned, she'd ask me to walk her home, and we would study together. 

During our sophomore year she began to open herself up to me about the problems she faced as I once did to her. I listened and tried to help as much as possible. I trusted her and I believe she trusted me. 

I never really made it known how I felt about her, but I assumed she must have. At some point during this time I brought it up. She was down to earth and very sociable, to the point where she would always say ""love you"" and use affectionate nicknames usually reserved for couples. To clear the air and in an attempt to guage the mixed signals, I asked why she did this and if she wouldn't do it because I didn't want to get the wrong message. Her response was that's just the way she talked and that she just wanted to be friends. I didn't hit me too hard as I didn't really think she felt the same way I felt about her, but it felt good in a way to know. 

For my junior year, I'd be transferring to a different school because they offered a specific class I wanted to take. Me and Maria stayed in contact, mostly through text.

I'd tell her how I'm doing, usually lying so she didn't worry. Sometimes we'd just get food and chill at my house. I tried to suppress the feelings I still had for her and just tried to be a good friend. 

There are two memories that stick out the most and will become more significant in time.

The first being the one day she asked me to go to New York with her so she could give her cat away.  We took the train and along the way the cat peed in the carrier. We scrambled to get the cat and the carrier clean while trying not get cat urine on ourselves. After handing the cat off, we walked around just talking and stopping in some shops until the train came.

The second being the day she asked me to come to get her first tattoo. During the tattooing we just talked and at a point the artist asked if I was her boyfriend. We both said ""no"" quickly. And I couldn't help but think what could be. At my house she asked me to take a picture of her tattoo. The tattoo was on her lower back. She got on her knees and bent over, and not trying to be a creep, I took the picture quickly and didn't linger. 

In hindsight, I often ask myself why did she choose me to go to New York with her? I have no delusions that we're the best of friends. So why me? Maybe she wanted to spend time with me. My naive wishful thinking would lead me to believe that she chose me for a better reason. Maybe she felt more for me than she let on. My rational side says she just needed someone, anyone, and I was the only person that was available.

Why did she bend over on all fours for the picture? I could have just as easily taken the picture with her standing up. My friends and more wishful thinking would push me to believe it's because she wanted me. Rationally thinking, it's because she really does see me as just a friend and trusted me.

I put all of my thoughts and feelings into poetry around this time. Some handwritten, others entered on tumblr. 

Now, after graduation and a few years, we talk and see each other a lot less. I stopped thinking about her so much for a while and felt I was over her at last. But then she contacted me out of the blue and we start talking again.

She's had a child with her boyfriend (now ex) and goes to school to become a nurse. I have a girlfriend, work, and go to school taking pre med. We text each other. Making sure we're both okay, showing support, send pictures to show how old we've gotten, etc..

My girlfriend knows of Maria and despises her. What little of my handwritten poems she found she threw away. In the moment, I thought I was wrong to have kept them. In hindsight, it wasn't. It was my art and she had no right to dispose of it without even talking to me about it. I see her for the abusive person she is, but for complex reasons I stay with her. 

I reached out to her today to wish her happy mother's day, she responded with:

"" Thank you!! Love you ‚ù§Ô∏è it's always nice to hear from you no matter how many years go by""

I think about her a lot. I wish I had the courage to end my abusive relationship. And tell Maria, bluntly, once and for all how I feel about her. But then I think ""why risk it?"". She told me outright we were just friends years ago on the bleachers. I have no reason to believe that anything has changed.",13May2019,491
32,"I lost you, and I only have myself to blame.

I had never had a friend like you. Don't get me wrong, I have great friends, more support than most do. But never someone where I felt like our minds were in sync. We were so different, but we could talk all day. You made me one of those people glued to their phone, smiling away at your little jokes.

I remember one night you were upset and you lay your head on my shoulder. I stroked your hair for a while before we shared a cigarette outside. Tension in the cold air, but neither of us acknowledged it. We only lasted another week before our first kiss. The best part was the moment just before our lips touched, when we both knew what was going to happen.

I had been closed my whole life. I'd reached the age of 26 without anything more than a handful of dates and casual flings. But I never had any doubts about us. I'd distanced myself from my family, the anxieties of my early life instilling routine within in me. In some ways it served me well, it pushed me far in my career and my dedication to the gym had got me in good shape. But it meant when our relationship came along I was inexperienced and rigid.

You were my opposite in many ways. Spontaneous, emotional, a little chaotic and with a history of intense relationships. You told me you had only dated people who were like you before. I started making time for you, it wasn't easy with our work schedules often clashing. This may sound ridiculous, but two dates a week was very significant to me at the time. It was all so new to me. I wanted to build something sustainable with you, I'd seen so many friends rush in and it blow up in their faces.

You really built my confidence. You told me I was so supportive, dependable, loving, kind. That you had never been so attracted to a boyfriend, that I was so nice to you. That I was the best man you had ever met. You made me feel that I was OK, that I wasn't destined to be a failure in relationships. I had fallen in love with my best friend. The funniest and kindest girl I had ever met.

Two months in I started studying for that postgraduate exam and it worsened all my rigidities. Waking up at 6am to hit the gym before work, working all day then straight to the library to study until bed. The couple of dates per week I had with you were such a relief. I just had certain things I wanted to achieve at that time. We still spoke constantly via text. I thought I could balance it all, I was wrong.

I know sometimes you felt like I was rejecting you, you told me once you felt unprioritized. It kills me that I made you feel that, I just struggled to match your intensity. I was so worried about ruining things and I got caught up in my routine and pre-conceived ideas about relationships. It was never because I didn't love you. I'd seen my friend build something beautiful with his partner by starting slowly and maintaining some independence, now they were engaged. But I should have compromised with you more, I know you wanted more. I thought we were getting there slowly, I thought I was growing with you.

We only lasted four months. Although we had our differences, I had no idea things had become final for you. Just a week before we were arranging our first vacation. That week you said all your friends were complaining about their relationships, that you felt smug because you had nothing to complain about. But something changed. You told me we were too different, that we wanted different things from a relationship. You said you wanted someone you could merge your friends and interests with, that I was into the gym and you preferred partying and festivals. You said you felt second choice to everything in my life, my studies, work. That I was too closed off. That I stopped you living. I cried in your arms, your t-shirt wet from my tears. Something snapped inside me. Nothing meant anything to me anymore. My mind obsessed over where I went wrong. Sinking further into depression, friends commenting on how much weight I had lost, how tired I looked.

I know you wanted to stay friends and I thought I could do it. But it was killing me. Always wanting to talk more, to kiss your head and hold you when you were upset. I took myself to therapy to try and work on myself in the hope you would give me a second chance. We got so close, you said you had seen positive changes but it wasn't enough for you. You were upset I had done it after our breakup rather than when we were together. You told me you were still in love with me, I asked if we could build something new together and that I knew now our old relationship didn't work for you, but you said no. You said I can't have changed enough. I've managed to cut down on the gym, my exam is over. I actually feel guilt that I could now potentially be better to another girl in the future, you deserved it.

It's been three months since we last talked, eight since we broke up. My dreams are haunted by you. I wake up believing we are still together and every morning I have that sinking realisation. My mind ruminates on it all day. I'm a shell of the man I once was. I know you're with someone new now. He seems more like you and he is probably much better at this than I am. I hope you are happy. I still see you at work sometimes, the cold look you have towards me now cuts through me. It's like you barely recognise me. Just the other day I cried in the bathroom after we had that awkward interaction.

I know it is ridiculous to be this obsessed over a four month relationship. Everyone tells me I should just move on and forget about you. But how can I? How can I forgive myself for ruining the best thing I ever had. I would do anything to go back and have our time again. I don't recognise that rigid, closed man I was before. I hate him. I don't know why I couldn't just give you more. I fear this will haunt me for the rest of my life, I can't keep going like this. I don't want to live without you. I fantasise about dying but I know it would just hurt people.

You reached through walls I had built up for years. You held a mirror up to everything I was missing and slapped me awake. I'm just sorry I couldn't change sooner for you. I'm sorry I let you down. Maybe one day we will speak again. If we don't then I hope you have an amazing life. All my love.",13May2019,5
33,"(For context I‚Äôm 18 M)

My now-ex girlfriend and I dated for nearly two years. We had had big fights before and brief breaks. A few weeks ago, after a HUGE ordeal that took place over phone, we broke up.  

Seriously a few days later I started to get feelings for another girl that I work with. I think these feelings had been deep within me even during my relationship with my ex, but I never admitted it to myself.  

About two weeks after our breakup, my ex and I had a talk and agreed that we could try getting back together. I didn‚Äôt want to agree, but I did because I didn‚Äôt want to hurt her which was stupid. We were supposed to hang out, but I damn near had an anxiety attack, and I told her that I wasn‚Äôt sure if we should be doing this. After that, we broke up for GOOD and haven‚Äôt talked since then. 

I was depressed as shit for a few days, but after that the feelings for the other girl started to take OFF. I felt guilty about it at first but then I just developed a full on crush on this girl. It‚Äôs still
a bit weird to me though. Like, I moved on REALLY quickly. I‚Äôm completely over my ex. Maybe because my ex and I‚Äôs relationship hadn‚Äôt been healthy lately? 

This isn‚Äôt exactly new. I‚Äôm currently a freshman in college, and ever since the beginning of high school when the ol‚Äô hormones really started to get going, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever gone longer than 2 weeks without having a crush on someone. But it‚Äôs different this time, because this past relationship was by FAR my longest.

I get along really well with this new girl. Whenever we work together (which is rare) we talk the entire time and we Snapchat a bit. I don‚Äôt know if she feels the same way about me, though. A man can hope and try his best. It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve been a single guy talking to a girl I like. 

I guess that leaves me with two questions:
1) this is normal, right? I talked to my friends about it and they said I shouldn‚Äôt feel guilty.
2) any pointers on how to do things with this new girl? I feel relatively confident. I‚Äôve grown a lot over the years and I‚Äôm less shy and I totally flirt with her, at least I think I do. Any valuable advice would help. Like I said, it‚Äôs been a while.

34,"You where supposed to be the one. For years I said I didn't need you. I was happy to have you in my life and wanted you there but was perfectly content with myself if you ever wanted to leave. I meant it, and I let you know it too. 

Then we had the boys. You where a nightmare. Damn near a a crazy stranger in my wife's body. First for 7 months of postpartum, then for 8. But I stuck by you. 

We started going to therapy after the second. You and the therapist convinced me I had walls up. I needed to let them down and let you in. So I did. Eventually I even started to believe in fair tails. Started to actually believe we would be together always.

You and the therapists convinced me to quit my job and chase a dream. I knew I didn't do well without structure but I went along with it anyway. It felt amazing to fully trust someone to have my back. 

And it happened. I procrastinated and even fell into depression. Not even 5 months in you told me you where through. 6 years together. 2 beautiful boys. Just tossed away like it means nothing to you. 

Everyday I have to see your cold face that doesn't give a shit about me. The same face that once worked tirelessly to convince me that we would always be together no matter what and she would always have my back no matter what. 

I don't know how someone can just walk away based on 5 months out of 6 years. Then on top of that, I don't know how someone can just rip someone's children away from them and drag them across the globe. Especially when you once thought that person was your soulmate.

I'm not innocent. I know the parts I played in why it got to where it has. I just thought I meant more than that to you.

I also want to wear makeup. I think it seems like a really fun art form and women can make themselves look amazing with it. It gives you more options for personalization too since you can choose colors, styles, techniques, etc. I think it would be great to be able to highlight my best features and draw attention away from some of my flaws, v cover up some imperfect skin etc.


I'm not saying any of this like it's a bad thing, it just probably seems weird that I identify as a cis straight male but still wish I could do this. I'd definitely never do it in public under any circumstance although that is what I wish I could do. Not that I literally can't do it, I know I could, it's just not something I'd want to do just because I don't really want other people to know about it.

42,"It started when I did a woodworking project when I was about 18 without any sort of respirator, I was sanding and inhaling a lot of MDF dust and hours later I could barely breathe. Thinking it was asthma I would wait, and I went to the doctor, they said it was likely asthma and gave me an inhaler. The inhaler didn't fix it at all and I waited days, weeks, months and years, but there was always that lingering damage from that time. This was okay because it was very mild after the initial attack and not super noticable - but I never had my full breath back ever.   


This was fine for years, until last year I reacted really badly to an odor eliminator sprayed in my room which gave me very much the same as before, and like before I realised it was a similar affair, my lung capacity never came back from that, being permanently changed. I've listened to my doctors, and tried corticosteroids - long acting bronchodilators - short acting when I needed it - to little to no effect even after months. I even did CT Scan and it just came back with some minor scarring of my bronchial tubes - doctors always tell me it's just asthma. The attacks are happening more often lately and always leave a lasting change, my breaths become more laboured and shorter. I honestly feel like the condition of my lungs has deteriorated so much over the past year that I sometimes wonder how long I actually have left until it becomes very serious.  


I'm writing this a day after my latest attack, where I was struggling to sleep and could only get 2 hours in - this is the first time it has been so serious and the symptoms have barely improved since. I honestly feel hopeless and really just want to know what is actually happening - I don't feel like I actually have any symptoms of asthma apart from the attacks, but I don't cough or wheeze, my lungs always feel clear and the attacks don't usually come on right away - they come on sometimes gradually, or sometimes a few hours later. For now I will just believe that it is asthma and continue using my corticosteroids because it's honestly what I'm putting a lot of hope on.

Before this, I was incredibly depressed, only occasionally took showers or brushed my teeth, 

I am only 15, and I don't have anyone in my life who I can talk to. I don't have any friends, my family is emotionally abusive and judgemental. I‚Äôm not allowed to go to a counselor.

In high school, she bullied one of her classmates for being smart. Until now, she is still proud of her actions and does not seem to see what was wrong with what she did.

In her current job, she claimed that everyone in her workplace hates her. Listening to her stories, she paints herself as the victim while in reality, it seems that she's just being a bitch to everyone at work, hence the hating.

We've always had a tense relationship; thus, I try my very best to stay out of her way just to keep the peace at home (we live together along with our two other sisters due to high rent costs). Regardless, it is still extremely difficult to be in the same place as her. Every single move I make seems to offend her and I always, always hear snide remarks from her about the things I do (or didn't do).

She doesn't treat our other sisters this way, just me. I have repeatedly replayed the situations to see if it was my fault that she lashes out at me this way. Admittedly, there were some instances wherein I did have my fair share of errors, like failing to turn off lights or forgetting to close a window. But most of the time, I didn't even do anything. I would just be walking past her and she would always have something to say.

57,"My entire life has been imploding since February. I am bipolar; back then I had a mixed episode, nearly killed myself, and landed in the hospital for a week. When I got out my husband told me he wanted a divorce because he couldn't handle it or me. Fair. 

So now I'm losing my house, my partner, all the friends we had in common, basically 80% of my life. While I was in the hospital, I had made the decision to quit my job due to the overwhelming amounts of stress it gave me (stress sets off my episodes). It's the right decision to make, but that's the last 20% gone. I have solid prospects, so I won't stay unemployed for long, but it's still me cut adrift from the familiar.

I'm not in touch with most of my family.I have a single relative who I still speak with -- I'm going to go visit her tonight, actually -- but it would be so easy to loosen up on that connection and let that go too.

I have friends but the closest one lives 500 miles away from me. Thinking to myself as I sit alone in my new apartment, if I were to just disappear today, or if I were to withdraw from society completely, no one would likely notice. I don't feel like I'd be missed. 

I don't feel connected to anyone any more. I don't know how I would even forge new connections. I don't feel it's ethical to try to do so when it would be for self-serving purposes. Nobody wants to be friends with someone like me, who takes antipsychotics and whose brain interprets a slammed car door as a gunshot, who cries and makes sloppy emotional posts on /r/self when they forget to take their morning meds, who feels like they're play-acting at being ""normal"" when they talk to others.

This is just another bad day. I'll have better days. This just isn't one of them.",13May2019,1
58," Im a 21 year old guy who‚Äôs quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‚Äòawwww‚Äô (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I‚Äôm a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‚Äòawww ok see yer later‚Äô in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‚Äòohh...how did you apply for there then?‚Äô And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there‚Äô in a smiley way but she‚Äôs started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly.

62,"Sorry for the huge wall of text, it's more than I thought

I have very few friends, even fewer IRL. At the moment I only consider myself to have 2 friends IRL, only 2 people in the world I am comfortable going places with. I am in a groupchat with 2 other people one of which I am ok with but the other I have grown to resent. At first everything was cool, I got weird vibes but ignored them for the most part, then came their birthday party. This person is gonna be brought up alot so lets call them A. A is an extrovert, I and my other friends who went, B &amp; C, are extreme introverts. For the first time ever we all lied to leave because C and I were starting to have a panic attack, and B was really annoyed and I believe on that brink as well. A's friends were loud, pushy, and were not people I wanted to be around so we figured leaving after about an hour was best. We gave A their cards and gifts and left. After things are ok for a while. Then A brings up a story from when they were 15 about how they got completely trashed then drove a golfcart on a somewhat busy street in our town and how they got pulled over and lied to the police. Bad story but not enough to make you want to pull away from the friendship right? Well, then A starts saying how we should all drink. I am very open about how I am sober and always will be sober (I have a predisposition to alcoholism so I'm not going to risk it) and B just didn't find the idea of drinking appealing. A kept saying how we should try it 'just once' and got very annoyed when we kept refusing. One of our other friends changed the subject so that was dropped but never resolved. I know it is a super small thing in comparison to this and things that will happen, but in this time I started to not be able to stand how they talk. They are the type to rip their entire personality from the internet, constantly saying ""wig, tea, sis, snatched, stan, ect."" And I just cannot. The way someone talks, to me at least, is a large important piece of the puzzle. Then one day I muted the groupchat and the next day when I came back everyone was yelling at C. C had some issues of her own, we talked about one thing and it became the only thing she talked about, and apparently they had enough. I tried to look at it from both sides but A yelled at me for doing so, B ended up blocking C (we don't use messager, its more convienent for us to use instagram dms, spooky scary instagram) so C was begging us to tell B to unblock her. I said that is always my job so A should do it, and A refused so I sent a screenshot of A saying that and jokingly said ""A is being a pussy lmao"" and THAT TURNED INTO AN ACTUAL ARGUEMENT. C said 'im impressionable, like mentally a 4 year old' and A takes that literally and goes 'Do you have that diagnosed', which pissed me off because we are all sarcastic people who speak in similies and metaphors, they know damn well she isn't being stone wall. Long story short I get yelled at abit, C gets yelled at abit, and it ended with C getting removed from the gc and A repeating ""sorry doesn't cut it you have to show change"" while saying they are blocking and ignoring her that day. That was really the tipping point because I never had a problem with C, I found it annoying but everyone does annoying shit. NOW THE FUN PART! YAY! The last arguement that really made me blow my stack. A and I both identify as nonbinary (""but nonbinary isnt real"" if you don't think so cool, you don't have to respect the concept but you can respect me). We are all artists, and B made a new character on a base I gifted her. She gave the character she/they pronouns, and A, who is usually kiss ass to B just goes ""why did you give two pronouns""? Simple question right? B and I both respond (I have known B for upwards of 15 years) that its just a character and that it's not a big deal. This makes A livid. They go off on how disrespectful that is to nonbinary people and it turns into a nonbinary debate. It turns into ""nonbinary is trans blah blah"" ""i dont see it that way but blan blah"" ""well your wrong"" ""you see it how you want I see it how I see it and your not changing my mind"". It is already a heated debate until A brings up how they are going on hormones. A is a minor still visibly going through puberty, and I tell them it is not safe to do hormones until puberty is over with, I was born with 50/50 hormones and am an example of what would happen. Eventually B and I are both yelling at A to not do that until they are done with puberty and eventually B and I muted and let A yell down an echo chamber. I got on call with B and what made me really really dislike A now is that B was apologizing for starting this fight. B did nothing wrong, all B did was make a character, and A started a petty squable that made B feel like she did something wrong. Last night I finally took the first step and made a groupchat with just B and D (my other close friend who is rarely in the big chat) and have been making an effort to talk there instead of the larger chat. If anyone has any advice that would be great

65,"You'd think I'd be depressed, but I'm not. I've got one very good friend who I play PC games with, but no one at university (first year). I think the reason is partly because I have goals and am busy, such as work for my degree and getting better at CS:GO.

 Next year I will be living in a house with some random students which is a good way to make some friends. After my exams, I have promised myself that I will talk to girls and hopefully lose my virginal status (I'm an introvert and a shy person, so that's why). Also I have a goal to get fitter and build some muscle as I've been skinny my whole life. 

I'm not really into partying and I think it's sad how some people clearly pretended to know people on the first day just to improve their social status. I don't care what people think of me when I sit alone. I'm not embarrassed, I like who I am and I've said to myself: ""next year, I will make some friends"".

 I deleted instagram a while ago. I think it's just a place to flex and make people jealous of how 'perfect' their fake life is, when in reality, it isn't like that, nor do they look like that in real life. I don't compare myself to others (looking up to people is different) , nor care about celebrities or popularity. 

I rarely rarely get stressed and it goes instantly when I think ""what is life, we are meaningless when there are 100s of billions of galaxies in the universe. Nothing matters"". Obviously if I was in debt etc, things would be different. Basically I take a relaxed approach to life whilst still trying and having goals.",13May2019,2

I get up and walk into his empty room and without looking at the number I answered. it was some kind of service for older men calling to confirm his attendance ahead of time. The woman on the phone was very shallow about what it was and kept trying to get me to answer. I asked ‚Äúwhat is this for‚Äù a little more aggressive and she explained to me it was some sort of cock circus. now I was terrified at that response as any normal human being would be.

68,"I was a super enthusiastic kid, could find excitement in anything, could get the whole playground involved in a game, I always got new kids seated next to me because I was so friendly. Around age 7 (maybe 6 maybe 8) my older cousin started sexually abusing me. I definitely became more withdrawn, I stopped interacting with others as much to the point that most of the time I was in my head and I can remember the books I read at the time more than my actual life. 

However, when I did have to talk to people I still came across as joyful because... that‚Äôs just how I knew how to talk and act. I‚Äôd never acted any differently. But I didn‚Äôt really feel it. My parents are both emotionally stunted themselves so even though they picked up that something was off (by my mom‚Äôs admission years later) they didn‚Äôt really know what should be done and I didn‚Äôt seem that bad anyways.

That‚Äôs kind of how the pattern played out the rest of my school life. I was so depressed I would sleep through class and then come home and sleep through the afternoon. But if someone was talking to me I was perky. Even in my own head I was always optimistic though it was twisted and strange optimism. For instance I remember when I was 10 I was suicidal (not that I knew that word yet). I was looking at the knives in my kitchen wondering if cutting my throat would work and trying to figure out how to tell my parents that I wanted to die. My thought process wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúI hate life, i‚Äôm so tired, nobody sees how I really feel, etc‚Äù although that was all true. It was ‚Äúnobody knows what the afterlife is like, I feel like I‚Äôm over this life and it would be really cool to find out what happens after death. Maybe it‚Äôll be something fun! I can‚Äôt wait!‚Äù

I‚Äôve tried to act more morbid just to show others how I really feel, but I just feel silly and fake doing it. In the end my natural buoyancy always wins out. I‚Äôve had friends compliment me many times on how ‚Äúnothing can get me down‚Äù (in one‚Äôs words).

I‚Äôve been to therapy but I don‚Äôt know what to say. I literally just sit there because I have no idea how to express my problems. I mean I can give a general overview of my history of depression, but if they ask me how my day was my instinct is to say it was good even if that‚Äôs not true, because my mind will hold on to things like a pretty flower I saw that day or hearing a new song I liked and when I think back on my day those are the first things that come to mind.

All the same I think my natural inclination towards cheerfulness has probably saved my life, back when I was 10 and when I was suicidal again as a teen. I‚Äôve had a long held strategy of just distracting myself out of my worst moods, or always assuming that something better is going to happen in the next moment if I just blindly move forward towards it. When I was at my worst as a teen I met an exchange student in school and decided I wanted to do that. I shouldn‚Äôt kill myself because maybe living somewhere else would be cooler. On the exchange I actually was seriously depressed and reverted to sleeping all the time (sorry host family) but I was definitely distracted and I didn‚Äôt kill myself!

If I sit down and tally it I can see that on average my mental health has gotten worse as I‚Äôve come into adulthood, but I don‚Äôt want to sit down and deal with it because I actually think my current lifestyle is really fun and it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve felt so awake since childhood. My depression took a dive this year, but somehow I‚Äôm also more excited about life than ever. By the way I don‚Äôt shy away from negative moods when I‚Äôm alone. I like them because I think they‚Äôre interesting. I just can‚Äôt express it seriously when I‚Äôm with others.",13May2019,1

70,"First of all, thanks for reading this, even though we don't even know each other and I'am just a random guy on the internet.  
I honestly don't even know how to begin/what to say I'am just gonna start writing and see what happens.

So I've developed some sort of depression I guess (never actually went to a doctor/therapist). It started a few years ago when I suddenly began to feel this sadness/emptiness and it got progressively worse. I was never really that much into girls, not that I was homosexuell or so, I mean I just didn't really care about meeting girls, dating, even kissing and stuff (mind that I was about 19 years old). But of course the story doesn't just end here as the title suggests.

There was this one girl that I really liked and I mean reaaaally. I had a few ""crushes"" so to say but it was very different with her. We started hanging out and talking on the phone for every single day and I was slowly falling in love with her. And when I spent time with her I realized that these moments were the only moments where I have not been depressed for the first time since a long time. This went on for a few months and I finaly asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend and she agreed (I was 19 at that point). 

But it only lasted for approximately 1 month and out of nowhere she broke up with me over WhatsApp and told me that I reminded her of her ex-boyfriend, which she was still in love with. 

You can imagine how devastated I was and how unfair it appeared to me. Please note that I knew her for about 2 years and we had daily contact for about 6 months+.  
Well, after that I just felt like shit and honestly that was probably the time where  I cried the most in my entire life.

And I think it was at that moment  where I realized that I really wanted/needed a gf.

So I started dating other girls and about 1 year after the  separation with my ex I met a girl online and we went on a date.  
Everything was going perfect and we ended up getting in a relationship. So up to this point I had still been feeling like shit and things were getting worse and worse. When we both ended up in a relationshop however, I felt like a different person. I was happy almost all the time, I was actually learning better and had greater grades because I had the motivation to do stuff and everything was fine.

We both said the each other how much we were in love and that we wanted to stay together for ever. We spent every single weekend together with a few exceptions and every night I felt like crying, but not because of how sad I was but because of how lucky  I felt to have her in my life.  
We were together for a little bit over a year and then shit started going down. Honestly I still don't really understand how this happend but we broke up and after this constant back and forth of ""what if we try it again"" and ""I can't"" it didn't work out and I told her that we should completely break contact. This happend a month ago (I'am 21 now).

Honestly I don't even know who broke up because it was such a mess and explaining everything would essentially double or triple  the text so I'am not gonna do that.

Sadly, I now have realized that despite me beeing so happy it wasn't really gonna work out in the long run. She was really messed up from the inside and my friends told me they didn't even like her that much. So even though I really loved her I don't want to be with her again and I think it's good that we broke up.

But since the break up my depression started to kick in again and I feel worse than ever before.  
It's not really because of her, it's just that I feel like something is missing in my life, and that is a person that I truly love and get loved by.

I have really good friends that I know for longer that half my lifetime and honestly I don't think I could have survived all of this without them. If any of you guys read this shit: Thanks for everything I love you all.

But the thing is, depsite how awesome my friends are I never really feel like I'am ""completed"" the way I felt with my ex(es). And there are times where I want to leave my friends for a brief period of time just because I need some time for myself and I don't really want them to see me like that. I just lose the will to do anything and my mood gets so shitty I don't really want them to suffer because of that. Of course I talked about that with them, specifically with a guy I became friends with not that long ago (It has been a few years but not half my life).

So right now I feel like I don't wanna do anything anymore. Honestly I wouldn't even mind if I died today but I don't actually have suicidal thoughts. I say things like ""I just want to die"" often and it's not really a lie, it kinda is the truth, but at the same time I don't want to kill myself and I would never do that. It's just the thought that I would finally have my peace if you get what I mean.

So after all this shit I started dating again but it's currently not working out that great for me. I met a girl I really liked (not actually in love I mean I just really liked her character) but it seems like she didn't really care that much about me so I'am looking forward to meet new people.

I don't like to force myself into a relationship so I won't just get the first girl I meet just ""to be in a relationship so I can feel better"". That wouldn't be the best idea imo. But I want to keep searching for the right person so hopefully I feel better about myself any time soon.

Probably gonna talk to a therapist if I fianaly get my shit together but first I have to climb out of this hole to even call a doctor.

72,"This isnt ment for anyone really. I just need to type this out. Its been in my heart for weeks.

I have a 11 year old cat. He is slowly dying of old age. I have noticed the changes over the last 2 years. He was born the runt of the litter, he is smaller and weaker than his brothers were. He is still probably 3/4ths of a fully grown tabby cat. Like a kitten that started growing and decided to stop.

My cat loves to snuggle and sleep on my lap and every time I hold him its like a silent plea to keep him around longer. Every pound he loses is cutting me like a knife. I know he probably wont be around come the end of the year. Looking at him I cant just feel it. 

He weighs about 6 or 7 lbs right now, maybe less since the last time we weighed him. The medicine we give him stops the vomitting but  he cant gain weight. Even though hes been tested for everything under the sun hes still sick.

I know I cant fight old age. I cant fight the natural cycle of death. Yet I still hold him tightly like I can hold the life in him, squeeze some more years into him. 

He is nearing the end of his life, his face is old and grey, his body is small and skinny. I just dont know if I can accept it though. I have the clearest understand that there isnt a lot of time left for him and yet I cant accept it. 

I have had him since he was 4 months old. We foumd hom outside in a december blizzard just after Christmas. He looked half his age because of his size but the vet later proved otherwise. 

My brother watched him fall off a neighbor's porch into a snow drift. When we took him in he had icicles hanging from his tiny, cold body. We didnt expect him to survive the night. I kept him with me in blankets and towels and somehow he survived. 

We kept him, weve had him every day since. We named him Titan because he was so small we thought he deserved a big name. 

I have buried many pets that have run their course of life. No prospect of death of any animal has so profoundly upset me. I do not know if Ill be okay when the time finally comes. I will be there of course but I dont know if I will be able to handle his absence. 

Every time I see him I feel sad pangs in my heart with the realization that he is not forever. There will be a time, just like with all other pets before him, that he will pass and he will no longer wake me up to steal my pillow or curl up around my head. I will no longer have my hoodies stolen and covered in his fur. I wont see his beautiful green eyes. 

One day I will wake up and it will be the first day of many without him. Ill have an empty cat carrier and my baby boy will be gone. 

Im sorry for bringing everyone down. I just really needed to vent about this. I just needed to put it out there somewhere. Something to ease my mind I guess.",13May2019,161
74,"I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn‚Äôt look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way.

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‚Äòexcuse me....excuse me‚Äô and then asked me ‚Äòhow do you get a job in here‚Äô and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‚Äòyea we don‚Äôt know her that well‚Äô and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‚Äòawww no don‚Äôt say that‚Äô then the brunette said ‚Äòwell not weird just a bit...you know...‚Äô and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you‚Äô quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

Most of my friends began as smoking buddies; marijuana has done wonders for my social anxiety and my life in general. Now they are all my ride or die friends who value spending time with me.

It just feels weird having people who genuinely care about me and enjoy spending time with me. I've always felt expendable, like the hangout wouldn't lose anything if I was not there. But now the hangout doesn't happen half the time if I'm not there, or I'm told that my presence was missed. My friends have begun using phrases I use, and come to me for support when they're in a tough spot.

I'm still not used to it. Having a social circle has done a lot to help my depression, and I hate being alone now. But to think that not even two years ago, I was all alone save for a couple friends from high school that would visit once in a while. It definitely feels weird. Good weird most of the time. Bad weird on the occasional bad day. It's a big responsibility, but one I'm happy to have.",13May2019,8
82,"Just to start, I don't think I'm depressed, I know that's like the chemicals in the brain and I know it runs in my family but I've never been tested so, I might be good. I think this started after Christmas break, I'm a junior. Over the summer my parents got a divorce, I wasn't bothered by it, they had been fighting a lot recently so it was only a matter of time. After that school started

I've always been kinda overweight, when I was younger it was really bad but in highschool I started swimming so I look at least normal now. After winter break I started to see myself differently, like I only see all the problems, so I started working out in addition to swimming, and cutting back on meals, to some extent it worked but I'm still not happy when I see my reflection, to the point that  I've started trying to avoid seeing my reflection

When my parents broke up my dad moved in with my grandpa, who lived alone. Before that I wasn't super close with him, I was really close with my grandma, but family stuff happened, and then she passed away, so when my dad moved, I got to see my Gramps more, and my dad was like a different person, he was nicer, more laid back and understanding, I was able to finally act like myself around someone. Unfortunately a bit later my Gramps passed away, and my dad and I started moving stuff so we could sell the house. I had fun moving stuff though, I've always enjoyed manual labor (especially when I'm getting paid a little bit)

My parents daughter and I obviously don't get along, before I found out, something, I hated her because of her personality, she's just not an interesting or good person, but recently my dad told me the reason my mom was and is so overprotective to me. Apparently when their daughter was born there was a bunch of medical issues so they had to be careful, and when I was born not only did they not want that for me, they couldn't afford to go through it again. So yeah, I'm not her biggest fan. 

I'll try to speed this up so I don't hit the character limit. I have two real good friends, a girl and a guy, known the guy for years, the girl I met in highschool. Unfortunately I fell in ""love"" with the girl so I've been trying to keep that under control, which is difficult because she's a very physical person, really into hugs and gay stuff like that. For a number of reasons I can't tell anyone, so stuff hasn't been great, and now there's new people in the group that I'm not a big fan of, but this new girl doesn't do great when she doesn't have friends, so I told my friends that it'd be fine if she comes around. Sure it's everyday but she deserves to be happy, she didn't do nothing to me

I don't really talk much anymore, unless I'm with my dad. My friends have noticed but I just tell them I'm fine. My mom thinks I hate her, to be honest I might but I just tell her I'm tired, I don't enjoy any of my hobbies anymore. Every day I pull myself out of bed and just wish for the weekend so I can go be myself again with my dad, but until then I have to be this, kinda shell of myself, because, well I don't know why, it just happens",13May2019,5

84,"I've been having a rough couple of weeks.  Work has been stressful, I've been feeling stress in my marriage and I've been having some philosophical differences with my best friend that have been weighing hard on my heart.  I've been feeling less than great about myself, my contributions to my relationships and my overall worth as a person.

Yesterday, I sat down at lunch with my wife and kids for mother's day and we were at a booth near the entrance of the restaurant.  A couple walked in with a young boy of about 6 years old and I didn't really think much about it, other than that the mom was very pretty.  The restaurant was crowded and busy for mother's day and they had to wait a few minutes for their table and they were sitting at the benches near the front door.  All of a sudden, the little guy ran up to me, threw his arms open and gave me a BIG hug and just held on to me.  I was completely taken by surprise, but after a stunned second, I gave him a hug back and asked him how he was doing.  His mom came up to get him and was all apologies, to which I responded that it was no bother at all and it was actually pretty nice, to which she responded, ""Well, he tends to see right into people and he must have liked what he sees in you.""  Turns out, Jacob (the kid) has Down Syndrome and is just a genuinely sweet kid.  I'm not sure about the seeing into people part, but he sure did make my day.  Thanks, little guy.",13May2019,4
85,"this is bullshit. it‚Äôs been nearly 200 years since we discovered climate change and we haven‚Äôt done nearly enough. up until recently if you showed any compassion towards the environment you were considered a hippy and belittled to being a dumbass college kid who smoked weed. we need to do something about this and get our shit together because leaving all our problems for the younger generations to solve is essentially procrastinating on the project that is saving the earth. it doesn‚Äôt help that our (USA) government is a complete joke when it comes to climate change and saving the planet. we need people who will help. 

don‚Äôt know how to help? here‚Äôs some ideas:

you know when you get a drink from mcdonald‚Äôs and you instinctively go for the lid and the straw? don‚Äôt do that. don‚Äôt waste plastic on your happy meal. 

leaving the house for the day? turn off the fucking lights. you don‚Äôt need them to see when the sun is up. 

be conservative with your water usage. most of the doesn‚Äôt have water and you‚Äôre out here taking a three hour shower. 

public transit is cheaper than owning a car (at least where i live) and uses less fuel. think of it like this: instead of 20 people driving their own cars, 20 people are riding in 1 very big car.

 Then everything went wrong. My grandfather, mother, &amp; uncle passed away between Nov 22 &amp; Jan 29. My girlfriend left me on Feb 1, &amp; I was kicked out of college on Feb 17. 

My ex then cut contact sometime in March, &amp; so a spiral of depression ensued. I couldn't leave my house. I self harmed daily for the first time, &amp; my only intention was to end my life.

I‚Äôve gone to therapy a few sessions now and our relationship has turned more of being myself instead of ‚Äúbeing his girlfriend‚Äù and our relationship has improved tremendously.

92,"I feel like a lot of people are too young to remember what 4chan was about a decade ago, it's always been a very counter-culture website and because of this it was pretty left-wing/anarchist around the bush-era. Everyone there disliked the rich, many people supported Obama, LGBT rights, etc (despite the edge-lord jokes) and were more likely to quote V for Vendetta than Mein Kampf. I mean I literally just stumbled across a post on 4chan today where people were talking about how much they want to start gassing transgender people, that's a far cry from the 4chan when I was a teenager.    


Side point, does anyone else feel like the 13-18 year old demographic of today are radicalised and alt-right wing than the previous generation? I feel like Trump is oddly popular with that age range, despite being nothing like them (older, rich, etc)",13May2019,39
93,"I grew up as a third culture kid in a very white setting and was subject to violence from peers of my race, which has bred hatred towards my race and an obsession with White people. I have essentially optimized my life choices to stay as far away from Korea as I can, and am happy about this decision.

I'm Korean by birth, but have spent only about 1/3 of my life there. I never miss home and my dislike and fear of Koreans even deters me from visiting family.

Why? Because I was viciously attacked, ostracized and assaulted by Koreans throughout my time there. I hate Korea, its people and culture.

Enter Player 2.

Ironically, I am married to a wonderful woman from my culture but every time she behaves Korean, I cringe. I realized after a while that she was much more ""Western"" in public than at home. She feels like the embodiment of what I seek to purge from myself and forget. I am often left wondering ""maybe I should have sought out someone that isn't Korean."" 

Honestly, her Koreanness sometimes makes me feel like I am failing the one thing I wanted to do with my life: ditch Korea. I have had passing thoughts along the line of ""wish you were white."" a few times. It is terrible, I know.

I am at a loss for what I can do at this point - I am aware that a white/black/latina girl wouldnt change my self loathing. But the thought keeps nagging at the back of my head, and is slowly evolving into an obsession.

I currently am seeing a therapist, but have not made much headway. I dont know what I can do, as ""embracing my race"" is not something I want to do ever. The alternative seems to be divorce.",13May2019,0
94,"I (F, 32) was in a very close, loving relationship from age 20 to age 30; we lived together, travelled the world, and had very integrated lives. It came to an end about 18 months ago when he confessed he wasn't sure he wanted to be with me and wanted to go on a break. This came as a shock, but eventually he came back and decided he did want to plan a future with me. By then I felt our relationship had been ruined by his ambivalence and immaturity however, so I ended things. Breaking up was the most difficult thing I've ever done, but after a few months I started to feel stronger, began dating, and generally felt that my life was on the up. I started a new (initially quite causal) relationship, and felt like I was undergoing a bit of a sexual awakening after a decade of monogamy. This lasted for about 8 months, until abruptly two months ago I started to experience intense, overwhelming feelings of grief and sadness. It's come and gone since then, but I generally find myself feeling very stuck, and experiencing what I guess is depression. I am frequently inundated with feelings of loss, anger, nihilism, self-pity and self-disgust. I feel alone amongst my peers as almost all my friends are in the midst of getting married or starting families. I don't know anyone my age who has come out of a comparably long relationship; it's many years since any of my friends went through a breakup. The man I am now dating is aware something is wrong but I'm afraid to reveal the extent of my feelings to him given that they concern my past. I don't doubt my decision to end the relationship with my ex as I felt it was really over, and when we see each other I don't want to get back together. But I'm haunted by memories of the closeness we shared, and feel sickened knowing I won't experience it again. Outwardly my life is in good order and I appear to be doing well, but internally my confidence has been destroyed. I am concerned that these feelings don't seem to be abating, and that nearly two years after the breakup began I haven't made more progress. I'm also concerned about how inward-looking and egocentric this suffering is making me; unable to really participate in my friends' joy at getting married, consuming a lot of their time and energy as I am frequently sad and anxious. And I'm afraid that these feelings of bitterness and alienation will also mar the relationship I'm in now, and make it even harder for me to find intimacy and trust in the future. I know that it can take a very long time to get over the end of  long relationship, but I'm not sure how long is normal, and what I can do to help this process along.

Everything was going well and then one day she just decides to start ignoring me. This went on for four days until I finally asked what was wrong and if she was okay. Long story short, she ended up cutting off everything we had which hurt a lot and I'm still thinking about it every day. Due to this I just feel so unloved.

When I am riding a roller coaster, I am more present than I am in any activity other than sex and masturbation.
