0,I have been bullied for the last 3 years both physically and verbally. I have done nothing to stop this person and it's kind of the point where I feel pathetic. I don't know whether it's time to tell a teacher or it's time to fight for myself and I guess I just need advice.,08Feb2019,1
1,"I've had some decent success from OLD as a guy and I've met some pretty intresting women. But man, online dating is just totally shit. Not the people, just how it's designed. In theory, it sounds fantastic. Being able to meet and connect with people you wouldn't normally meet on a daily basis. But in practice, ugh I don't see why it's even popular anymore. The horror stories I've heard from women and what they have to put up with. Pyscho guys, creeps, pervs, etc. Then the shit guys have to deal with. Ghosting, unresponsive matches, crazy people, etc. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying dating irl is perfect, but it feels so much more natural and real. I'm rambling, but I feel a lot better getting it off my phone. Hopefully the urge to download this junk on my phone doesn't come back.",08Feb2019,1
2,"When I see subs like r/NiceGuys r/NiceGirls r/ChoosingBeggars i truly do not understand why the person doesn’t just stop responding after the first hint of something being off. Now this doesn’t apply in all cases, but SO MANY on there can be entirely dealt with by deleting/blocking the person harassing you. I understand sometimes it comes from people you know and can’t really tell, but in a lot of cases what’s the deal? I’m trying not to victim blame but the delete/block button is right there, plus it’s so much easier to ignore these messages rather than responding and egging them on. 

Once again, in cases of violence being threatened or other special circumstances I understand the need to attempt to defuse. But it seems like the people responding aren’t much smarter than the people looking for a reaction... ",08Feb2019,1
3,"I’ve decided to create this account and go by the pseudonym Courtney. Anyone coming across this who may know me personally may already know Courtney, but that’s alright. I’m a 27, soon to be 28 year old male that has been suffering from this disorder for about 15 years now. I get up out of bed multiple times a night and eat copious amounts of food- typically anything high in fat or sugar, while I’m still completely asleep. When I wake up in the morning you can imagine I typically feel very full, embarrassed, and will not eat for the first half of the day (sometimes called morning anorexia). 

I finally got to a sleep doctor a few months ago and started taking a medication that unfortunately stopped working. There is very little they currently can do for me other than add medications or increase my dose and hope for the best. When I was younger this wasn’t as big of an issue (my metabolism was better). However in the last few years I have gained a large amount of weight. I’ve been having to diet and exercise to try to balance out my unconscious eating habits. 

I’ve managed to lose 15 pounds of the 50 I’ve gained through diet and exercise, but it’s been a slow battle. Every morning I still find the mess Courtney (my nightly binge-eating twin) leaves behind in the kitchen. Peanut butter finger prints, bread crumbs, the lid not properly replaced onto the carton of almond milk etc. Sometimes what I eat throughout the night can account to half a day’s worth of calories.

I’ve definitely seen the comical side to all of this and even considered placing cameras in my kitchen to try to catch myself in these situations (as I’ve only ever heard friends and family tell me about how I do this and tell me about Courtney’s wild personality). But first and foremost I want to try to combat this as a health issue. The weight gain, emotional toll, and disturbance it has on my sleep over the last decade and a half has weighed me down quite a bit. ",08Feb2019,1
4,"I explained the circumstances of why I was mad.

I carefully thought of my word placement and vocabulary in every sentenence.

I went back and changed phrases and words to improve the sincerity of the message I wanted to communicate.

I brought in my justifications and reasoning for why I brought up the issue and suggestions for future improvement.

Then I realized that just writing the email was so cathartic that I actually didn't even want to send it because just writing it out made me feel better...

So, I deleted it.",08Feb2019,1
5,"I won’t get into specifics as to what it is, but for a year or so now I’ve been having this one annoying thought/feeling return to my mind repeatedly.. day after day.

For some time this thought led me to take action, and I had followed along with it for some time. (Nothing self harming, although it was out of irrational fear.) Only until now I’ve begun to really stop taking action and see clearly, and see the thing as a true problem. This happened a week ago. I don’t expect to be suddenly “cured” but god.

I feel clearance, but the thought still returns.
When the thought returns, it is similar to the feeling you have when you need to do something, or remembering an upcoming event. 

I’ve tried to figure out the source, to no avail. I wonder if I’ve just attached the thought to an emotion, and now it just returns strongly? I don’t know, it is so strange. Almost like an obsession.

Well, there’s my vent.",08Feb2019,1

7,"I’m studying to be a nurse but every time I have to go to the hospital I feel sick. Tomorrow I have my clinical at 7am and I already have a headache. I can’t tell if it’s me over stressing (I’m a very anxious person) or if I just genuinely hate the idea of doing this for the rest of my life. I want to do something fun and creative but so does everyone else and their mother.

I have nothing in life that interests me. I chose nursing because it’s the most practical and safe option. I figured I’d make myself like it because this is the only future I can secure for myself. I’m already 22 and I wasted an entire year of my life not studying or working because I was depressed. I did nothing. I just slept and cried and felt tired all the time. Even when I would try to put in effort I’d feel too weak to continue and stop halfway every day. But I’d always think the next day would be better. It didn’t. 

I had to go back to school in 2018 because fuck if I didn’t I never would’ve. I don’t know if it was the right choice. I need a little over a year left in my degree to finish. But...

Everything makes me fucking sad and anxious. Any slight change in a routine or something makes me nervous. My 2 friends used to call me nearly every day and just because they got busy these past few weeks I start to feel nervous like our friendship is falling apart. 

 I don’t think I’d even be able to handle nursing because of how bad I am under stress. I hate the person I am. I’m so easily stressed and agitated and I never feel genuine happiness. Any minor inconvenience gets me all sad. I always get headaches and I don’t even know what I like to study as a career.

It’s too late to change I’m already 22 and this deep in my career idk what the fuck else I’ll do. 

What am I? Is this me being emotionally unstable? Is it me having low self esteem? Is it me being incapable at handling life? 

The only thing I like about myself is that all this suffering I’ve put myself through to this point has made me empathetic and kind. I wasn’t like this before. But it’s not enough to thrive in life. I want to be free to do what I want. But I can’t. I’ve tied my own hands down. Limited my possibilities. 

Every day the only things I look forward to are talking to my friends and doing my skin care routine. Nothing else. 

I feel so confined not only in my head but my own house. It’s so small with too many people. I see my nephew and I think of how I’d wish I could be a child again. How I could start over and do things differently. How happy I was as a child. So innocent and free of worry and stress and anxiousness and depression and fear and emptiness.

I want to do things differently but don’t know how or what.",08Feb2019,1
9,I really love my personal space. Standing in line I want a full arms length between me and the guy behind me. When my coworkers come to my desk to review things on my computer I lean away. Come holiday time I try to wave hello to family and my half brother (different mother) who thinks this is funny always makes me bring it in for a hug and tells me he loves me while I grumble. My first serious boyfriend was not very affectionate and we had a kind of had an informal unspoken agreement on level of touching. I never really held his hands or made out with him. Ex boyfriend was a big guy who was offended whenever I flinched when he touched me unexpectedly. He said it made him feel like a monster. I’m just not accustomed to being physical. Current boyfriend is pretty awesome. We geek out on that nerd shit and have spirited debates on politics and laugh at the same type of humor and speak the same language of teasing each other. He does not respect my personal physical boundaries though. He’s always trying to kiss my hands or hold me or grab my boobs. It always pisses me off. I was having dinner with my older half sister (different father) and we were talking about this and her husband chimed in asking if that’s a family thing because she always leans back like wtf are you doing when he tries to hug her. I don’t know why I’m like this. It’s so irritating when ppl are in my space. And my boyfriend as great and compatible as we are otherwise just says I need to deal with his level of affection. I think this is something I need to get over. And as far as sex goes ( because I know you’re wondering about it) I usually only get in that mood when I’m very drunk. How do I get over this aversion to physical displays of affection?,08Feb2019,1
10,"Now I'm finally at an age where I'll be able to vote and make political decisions. I've been heavily involved with politics since I was a teen, and could even argue I was interested in the field since I was a child. It's my current dream to become one of the youngest Represenatives or Senators (perhaps even the president). I only hope that by some grace or god, I will be able to attain that. The only problem is, I'll be moving soon, and my political passions could be affected by where I situate.

My grandparents decided that we, as a family, should move one last time. They have settled on two states. One being more to the north and another towards the south. If we move north, we will be connected with almost ALL of our family. Aunts, cousins, and uncles that we haven't gotten to see in ten years. But there are downsides to this, as well. We won't be living as nice of a house, and my political dreams will be diminished. The way I see the world would never go over well in a predominantly democratic state.

If we move to the southern state, I could speak and connect with those who align with my political beliefs and moral values. I could build a good reputation, and perhaps become a young representative of that state when it's time. I would also never have to worry about money again, could better provide for my immediate family. And, the house we'll be living in would be real nice, yet cheap! The only downside to that is, I would never see my other relatives again.

I could become a fresh face in the political world. I could make changes for my country. Except, it would be at the cost of losing the rest my family. I'm literally choosing between family and Country, something I never thought I would have to do.

17,"I’ve been friends with this girl for about a year now. Only a couple months ago (around September) did I figure out my feelings for her. She’s absolutely out of my league, but I figured I had somewhat of a chance because of our history. I’m the type of person to prefer to have 1 or 2 really good friends, but I also feel almost naked standing alone in a group of people. My friend is good friends with another guy at this table, and that’s where we’ve sat this entire year. Everyone there except for friend 1 and friend 2 are total assholes. I really hate it. They do normal asshole shit like giving me everybody’s trash, taking some of my lunch, making fun of me, you know, the usual. What pains me the most is that I used to be friends with this group. I had drifted apart with them last year, and they apparently took it personally. Anyways, the ring leader of the group, let’s call him asshole who waste his parents money on supreme and Gucci, let’s call him AH, recently took a liking to my crush. At first I didn’t put much thought into it, because he’s friends with her friends, so they had to meet at some point, but it was when I saw AH creeping in the comments on her instagram that broke me. He didn’t know I liked her, but that’d only make him more into her. She’s stopped talking to me, I’m not sure why, and he told everyone at my lunch table today that he’s dating her.

19,I’m 18 and going on a date with this older guy I met through my job. He was a regular customer. I started getting to know him bc I got a tattoo and some piercings done by him.

He’s cool for the most part and always hooked it up with the piercings and tattoos and we texted for a while and I did contribute a lot. He invited me to a concert tomorrow night and bought the tickets and everything. He even offered to pay me to make up for having to call in to work but I told him no need. I’m just a little scared bc at the end of the day I don’t know this man too well. He was fun and nice and cool on the surface and I’m just scared I’m letting things go too far. I can’t bail bc it was expensive and I’ll feel bad. Should I enjoy the night out and just keep my close friends updated and share locations and all that and then call it quits after this in a nice way?

24,"I'm not quite sure where to post this and I'm not quite sure if I'm stupid for thinking that my case would be sexual abuse. Throwaway cause I don't wanna seem like a retard and don't wanna be insensitive to what I would consider actual abuse victims. 

So let me start off with this: When I was like 11-12 I would use the internet and back then a chat software named ICQ was hugely popular with everyone at my school so of course I used it daily. And I also used to go to their websites chatrooms where you can talk to strangers. So after a while I would become friends with this ""girl"" and after a while you know we started talking about more sexual stuff. And after a while it was like we were a couple and 11 year old me didn't think of the possibility that it wouldn't be an actual girl. 

So the person asked me for nudes and would sent me some of ""her"" (which I a few years later found out where just pictures of some girl ripped from the internet). And after a while I would keep sending her nudes and videos and I was so stupid for not realizing it was just some pedophile tricking me into sending him pictures and videos.  And it just makes me sick knowing that these probably still exist somewhere. 

Now over the years I had issues with coming to terms with this and I never really considered it being sexual abuse until recently, but I'm still not sure if it really is. I have never ever talked to anyone about this. ",08Feb2019,1

26,"Note: I’m a guy

So for the past few months, I’ve been talking to this girl that I met from a game. She’s the same age as me, same ethnicity, and also has similar internet meme interests. In fact, me and her both have traded problems that we rant about. Things about our family or trust issues. I really like talking to this person, they are funny, cute (at least from what I can hear and read), and generally awesome. 

However for the past month or so they talk to me less and less and in fact more to this other guy, who’s like way older. Those two have been friends for a longer period of time and during most of the day, they can be seen by discord playing games often with each other. I know they’re not dating, but it hurts whenever I try to strike a conversation with my crush it ends in a few messages. As they seem busy hanging out with each other.

Another big note it seems another friend of mine that I introduced to my crush talk more with each other than I do my with my crush. They seem to trade memes often and have inside jokes I’m not privy to. It hurts because when I talk with my friend he often talks about how funny and hilarious my crush is and about their conversations and jokes. 

Whilst I was also talking with my crush, I have found out they are gay. They even joked about it a few times and have talked about their past relationships a bit. I have nothing against people who are gay, but I lovey crush’s bombass personality. I have no advice from anywhere as my situation is quite strange and I can’t trust advice from my “friends,” as after a brief conclusion a lot of my friends are trash.

And just about everyday I think about how meaningless so many things are and how extremely short life is. I’m also struggling with the fact that I don’t have close friends.

I was majoring in mechanical engineering, my accumulative GPA was 2.9. Counted the days, had a very boring life where going to university felt like going to school (""I need good grades so I get a good job and have a good life""). I had absolutely no clue what my life after graduation was going to look like, I had no goals( other than passing with an average GPA and reaching Masters rank in an MMO I was addicted to).  
I always knew that this is not the life I want and it will never be but I accepted my reality and lived with it, I thought I had no way out. Depression and anxiety followed, I felt like the world was collapsing on me but for some reason, I never opened up to my parents, I didn't want to bother or worry them, they had a lot going anyways. The only thing that kept me going was the fact that I am getting a step closer to my graduation every day.

A good friend of mine made me realize that graduation won't solve my underlying nightmare, I had to step up and face my problems. So I did, I decided to drop out and find what I love, even if that meant sitting at my parent's place for now. I was shocked with my parent's reaction, they absolutely accepted and respected my decision and they gave me some time to figure out what I want to do with my life. They are also willing to support me all the way until I am back on my feet. I haven't been more proud of myself, I am glad I took such a decision at such a young age before I had responsibilities and commitments and was forced to do something I hate for the rest of my life.

Fast forward 2 years and I get told everyday how mich she hates it and she takes it out on me. We have had so many great experiences and made new friends. We live on the most beautiful part of our country and we have no shortages of things to do.

We were on the verge of divorce last year but decided to move to another town as a compromise as she is not happy year and our previous city is a hole. Today I mention to het that we can maybe adjust our price for our home down to make sure it sells and we can buy the house in the new city. And her response was ""I just so not want us to drop too much that we still make some profit. It will be the only positive of moving here"". It went to my core and lit a fire there and I immediately got so pissed off.

I again realised we are not the same person. I like adventure/compulsiveness and she is just so depressed and bitter she cannot see the beauty in life and what we have here.

40,"I don’t think I’ll ever be able to truly love anyone because I can’t even love myself. I haven’t since I was like 10. I’m not suicidal. I understand what a devastating chain reaction something like that would cause. I have a long-term plan if things don’t get better once I’m an adult, but I’d like to hold onto any small shred of optimism I can and hope that things might get better as I get older. Though I still doubt they will.

Not a day goes by where I don’t look in the mirror and punch myself in the face as hard as I can. I haven’t been able to get through a si gel day without some form of physical self punishment. I feel like an abomination and that my birth was a horrible mistake. I despise my birthday because of what it reminds me of, and I try to pretend it’s just a normal day. I think a lot of people feel it’s their moral obligation to carry on their genes to the next generation, but I think for me it’s the opposite. It’s my duty to make sure my pathetic genes rot away and die with me. 

Every night I just lay down in bed and rewind through my life while staring at the ceiling, thinking about how much better the lives of my parents and my siblings would be if I was killed as a baby or better yet never born at all. I’ve even had dreams of this. 

One of these dreams was of my Mom giving birth in a hospital. I popped out and immediately started shrieking. My parents took one good look at me and said “disgusting” in unison. The dream cut to my Dad holding newborn me upside down by the leg and throwing me into a dumpster behind a restaurant. The rest of the dream was just baby me screaming his tiny lungs out surrounded by trash until he died. It made me happy. 

Another dream I had that was long as fuck was basically an alternate timeline that showed my family if I wasn’t born. It was pretty much the same. My parents weren’t “missing anything from their lives”, in fact they had better job and more money and my siblings were happier. Really made me feel like a burden. 

And yes, I’ve been to therapy. Didn’t help. Plus it was expensive. So not only am I an emotional burden but I’m also a financial burden on my parents. I’ve had a lot of fantasies where I see a sharp object and picture jamming it into my neck or cranium so my family can be free of me. In the end I would never go through with it because my parents seem to think I’m a gift and would be devastated.

41,"Please excuse any missing facts i dont know everything going on. Starting with backstory, back in augest 27th i moved started crashin on my friends couch until i was able to sign a lease with my future roomate, long story short he fucked me over and i still live on my friends couch. Now for the bullshit, two months ago my roomates were with someone in detroit and that someone set fire to a file room in an abandoned fire training center. Now two days ago my house got raided by over 20 cops with a search warrent and AR-15s, its a two bedroom condo so it seems a tad excessive, makes more sense nkw that someone had suggested that there were so many simply because they pissed of the PD, But at the end of the day they took over 10 hard drives multiple cameras and cellphones and laptops. now heres where im caught up, i smoke weed medically without a medcard however every thing i own is stored in a common area of the house, there was also a small ammount of hemnessy on the table and wine on the fridge, no one is 21, the medcard holder is 20 and us other 2 are 18. My roomate has a medcard, and my other roomate had a dispo bag with weed in his room so youd imagine that doesnt look good. Also i had my ex staying the night, abd right before the police sargent removed my cuffs i said somthing about they barged in on me gettin fuck, then he said how old are you, i said 18, then he told me my ex was 15, i insisted i didnt know which seems obsurd but its true 5 seconds later the sargent had another officer remove my cuffs Now both my friends were detained and i assume arrested, they were taken a county over because we dont live in detroit or near, i was let go and told i couldnt stay while they were there so i went to work early, the cops allegedly went through they 18yos snapchat memories which im sure had things of me, now id imagine they had enough evidence on me if they wanted me arrested, but im still concered the cops are going to come back for me just cause they are pissed, if they cant prosecute my roomates.

 Anyways, I have gotten infatuation and love mixed upI've misunderstood fucking and love to be the same thing before as well.  I now know that love is not sex. Love is not butterflies in your tummy. Love is hard work. 

To love yourself and accept yourself can be a challenge when you know that you are the bad guy. I shouldn't love myself that's narcissistic if I love be my bad parts. So I'm on this journey to find the good things about myself to love and nourish. I have been so egotistic and uncaring and unable to love for so long that it is now making me feel incredibly isolated. Heck, I guess I'm like magic man.

59,"Names have been edited out:

I had a moment today--during Homeroom-- where I was sitting at my desk in the art room, and A was sitting at her desk to the left of me. Her friends had come to visit her at her desk (B, C, and D). I began to feel completely cast out as they were having a fun conversation about parties and drinking, their lives, and inside jokes. It made me feel terrible about myself because I felt like I would never be true friends with any of them, albeit anyone. That isn’t hard to believe with the people that I really have basically no relationship with--B, C, and D--but it hurt to think about that in relation to A. 

I consider her my best friend, but I know that she does not feel the same way about me. She’s the type of person to call all of her friends her best friend so that no one feels left out, but I know that if it really came down to it and she had to choose a single person, it would absolutely not be me. I have a terrible personality--I have trouble staying in contact with people (texting, Snapchat, etc.), I’m terrible in conversations (I am always scared to say something weird so group conversations are better where I can get away with barely talking and only chiming in when I have a joke to say that I think everyone will like), and I can’t share anything personal with anyone out of embarrassment which makes it unbelievably hard to cultivate a personal relationship with anyone at all. 

I am totally fine with hearing about others’ personal thoughts and experiences and I would never judge them (or, at least, not out loud--I want them to feel like they can trust me), but when it comes to me sharing things, I cannot bear the thought that they are probably judging everything that I am saying. I’m too insecure to get over that barrier. It’s even worse when I actually work up the courage to share a sliver of my feelings and then regret it later and feel like an idiot for thinking that they wouldn’t judge me for sharing part of my life. 

Also, I do not think my problem is just my personality--it’s also my appearance. I am fat. I won’t deny it. I’m trying to change that, but still, right now, at this moment when I want to have close friends and be involved in conversations where I don’t feel like I’m lacking something, I feel like my weight is completely holding me back--internally and externally. Internally, I feel unbelievably insecure. I hate the way that I look, and that causes me to not want to open up. I feel like I’m not worthy of having someone not judge me just because I am fat. I feel like anything that I say will just be written off and not taken seriously nor go unjudged just because I am fat and ugly. Externally, I feel like I am constantly being judged. I hate being the largest person in a room. People look down on me and pay less attention to me because of it. I don’t want to be the center of attention all the time--I would actually hate that--but I also don’t want to be invisible. 

The worst part of my insecurity, though, is probably my face. Maybe it’ll get better once I am skinny, but, unlike my weight where it can be changed, my face cannot (unless I have thousands of dollars). I want to be pretty and skinny and have people be interested in me and willing to get to know me and look past my ugly face and my fat body. 

I am too ugly to be loved. I am too ugly to truly be friends with anyone. I am too ugly and boring to deserve to be treated fairly and equal to that of someone who is skinny and has a beautiful face and interesting things to say. I’ll be alone forever. Maybe it’s a good thing I’m an introvert.

60,"So I'm a 25-year-old virgin, female. I met this guy on an app and really liked him. we went on a few dates before he learned that I'm a virgin. Before that, I know for a fact that he really wanted to have sex. And I've always been very conservative about sex and have never gone further than kissing all my life as I knew it will only make it harder to restrain myself from having sex. where I come from, Virginity is a big deal, word gets around quickly and all that simply complicates your life. 

But at this point, I let myself get into bed with this guy because he was a stranger, was someone I felt comfortable with and also I liked him. I told him I wasn't ready to have sex yet and we just ended up doing other stuff. And ever since that he has been ""too busy to catch up"" but still keeps texting every day which is very confusing. 

But the real issue is that, now I cannot stop thinking about sex. Because I LOVED whatever stuff we did the other night and it just keeps coming back to me ALL THE TIME! My course is quite intensive and I've been slacking for the past three weeks because of this. I'm horny most of the time and have absolutely no Idea what to do. This is starting to affect my grades. The worst part is, I once told him that I'm horny and may be ready to have sex (the most embarrassing thing I've ever done) and he actually didn't sound excited about that(we were only texting and he replied after 2 hours!), he was just being nice.

I understand clearly that he isn't interested in dating me and probably doesn't want to have sex with me anymore. But I don't understand why I'm so obsessed with the thought of having sex with him. I liked him a lot (not so much now), but I still think he is a nice guy. Maybe that's why I'm caught up in these thoughts. He might have definitely lost some respect for me as I told him I wasn't ready and was then just after a few days I told him I was ready. And we didn't get to meet in those few days, so he might have thought that I was using sex to get him to meet me, which is really really embarrassing. 

Can someone please help me from obsessing over this thing? It is toxic too as I think I have feelings for him and even if I have casual sex with him, it will only end up hurting me. I know this shouldn't at all be a priority in my life at this point. I'm at the university and this is a very crucial time for me. I would be grateful for anyone who can talk some sense into me.

69,"* Question: What's a 221(g)?

A security clearance/background check for non-immigrants (NIVs) and immigrants (IVs) which takes place under the status/case of ""Administrative Processing"".

* Question: Is it an approval or refusal? 

It's a temporary refusal. (temporary refusal = **MAYBE**)

* Question: How long will that processing take?

It's usually resolved within **30 to 60 business days** and can either take shorter or longer depending on your circumstances.

* Question: Is a temporary refusal a bad thing?

It's actually a **GOOD** thing. (It means you have a case and are being considered!)

&amp;#x200B;

No matter who you are or where you are, receiving a 221(g) can be a very emotional experience because it's your future on the line and the waiting period can be the worst. Obviously, you need to **act quickly** and **follow the instructions** on the 221(g). 

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few things you should observe to understand your situation:

* If the consular officer kept your passport during your interview this is a **GREAT** sign, especially if your form says that they do not require further documents and would like you to wait on them to contact you. (These are approved in the shortest amount of time because all of the information provided during the interview was accurate).

&amp;#x200B;

* If the consular returned your passport during the interview it means that they require some missing documents and after they receive them post-interview, they will ask you to submit your passport at a later date. (If you have to submit documentation after the interview this creates delays in the processing so submit the required documents as fast as you can.)

&amp;#x200B;

* The **colour** of the 221(g) form has different meanings.

&amp;#x200B;

**Orange/Yellow** = Technology Alert List (**TAL**). 

This type of security clearance applies mostly to graduate students (sometimes undergraduates) or those employed in a speciality field/industry, if the research or position involves the use of sensitive data (mostly those studying or employed in **STEM** fields). Estimated wait: **7-31** business days minimum and **32-108** business days maximum.

**White/Blue** = Record ping/Name check. 

This type of security clearance applies whether you have a criminal background or not. Your name might have gotten matched to someone with the same or a similar name to yours, so your identity has to be verified. Estimated wait: **8-14** business days minimum but can take as long as **15**\-**90** business days maximum.

**Green** = SEVIS/USCIS related\*.

This type of security clearance is required when your data doesn't match what is on the system or contains errors. The errors can either be from bugs or slow updates in the system or human error on the application and can be resolved through verification. Estimated wait: **2-21** business days minimum and **22-42** business days maximum.

**Pink** = Internal Decision.

This type of security clearance is handled by the embassy and is required for verifying information during the interview that was deemed conflicting and involves the completion of a questionnaire/survey to move forward. This case type is typically updated regularly. (It is alleged that familial relations are connected to this type of processing) Estimated time: **To be determined**.

**Purple** = ""Unorthodox"".

This type of security clearance is given when most of the information provided via application and interview are deemed to be suspicious despite some accuracies. Estimated time: **Indefinite**.

&amp;#x200B;

**(If the processing exceeds 90 business days, consult with an immigration attorney on further action.)**

* Trying to personally contact the embassy about the status of your case during the waiting period will result in a generic message.
* Have your school, employer or attorney contact the embassy about your case instead (this **may** help your case get processed faster but no information will be disclosed about it).
* **Keep in contact** with your school, employer, spouse/family/friends or attorney to discuss your options based on deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Create a backup plan**: 

1. If you're in school defer for the following semester if 1-2 weeks after add/drop has passed. 
2. If your employer is waiting for you to fill a position, request accommodations for the delay if possible or considerations for another position that can be fulfilled by a later date. 
3. If you are married and/or have children keep connected with them and support each other through this time. 
4. If you're trying to go to a workshop, convention, conference or just planned to enjoy a nice vacation, do not purchase plane tickets or book a hotel until you have received your passport in hand.",08Feb2019,1

75,"         I swear it was like it came straight out of a movie. It was about 4 years ago, my first day of English class sophomore year of high school. I was sitting 3 seats behind a new boy in my class, heavily taking notes. The following is what he later relayed to me: 
        He was sitting in class, looked back towards the clock, and saw me. He thought to himself,  “I need to talk to her!” So for the remainder of the class period, unbeknownst to me, he preceded to pretend to drop his pencil and pick it up or pretend to be looking at the time so he could look at me again. He must have done it about 20 times he said, but I, who was buried in my notebook, didn’t notice. He sat there all period thinking of ways he could somehow approach me and ask for my number. Being the really shy guy he is, that was extremely nerve wracking for him. Then, in a glimpse of chance, our English teacher said we were going to be doing a project and had to work with the people in our row. He thought, “This is it!!” I, the devoted student, however, just thought “There’s a new boy sitting up there, I wonder if he will pull his weight or if I will have to do it 🙄” As I preceded to stand up and tell my group members how I, miss young and driven, will do all the work and that they would only be allowed to edit it, I glanced down and saw the most wonderful thing I have ever seen in my life. It was his face, smiling up at me. My first thought was “Wow, he’s beautiful”. I had seen boys before, but I had never, ever, seen any boy that looked as gorgeous as he did that Tuesday. I did not allow my rapid heart beat to derail my focus for long, of course, and preceded to tell them to let me do all the work. We all exchanged numbers (to his delight) and went on our way. 
       That night, I was texting in the group chat asking if anyone had any preferences for our PowerPoint format. Immediately, he messaged me outside the group chat with his answer. I thought, “He must not be able to text in a group chat or something” and directed my thoughts back to work. The next morning, he responded to me individually again! I thought, “He seems really nice, I’ll ask him where he’s from. He must not have many friends having just moved here and all.” And then we started texting back and forth.
        Around 10 text messages was all it took. I knew after that that he was the one for me, that he was different than any other boy in the entire world. He was charming, sweet, goofy, and really intelligent. He was everything I had ever wanted, but I didn’t even know I wanted until then. I honestly had never felt that way before, and all it took was a few text messages.
