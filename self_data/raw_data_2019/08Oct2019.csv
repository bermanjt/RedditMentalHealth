2,"There’s a lot to unpack here but I’ll try to make it short. 
My best friend moved in with a guy she knew in high school last year because he bought a house and had an open room. They became good friends/roommates. One day he revealed that he’s in love with her while they were at home...he knows she’s a lesbian but she explained again that she’s a lesbian and doesn’t feel the same way about him. He didn’t get it...he asked her if she were attracted to men would she be into him..So he treated her poorly for a bit then acted like it never happened. I moved away and came back into her life around that time and we’ve always been close, nothing new there. So he felt threatened and inserted himself in between us anytime he could. She tried sitting next to me at a baseball game and when I got up, he sat in the middle of us. When I stayed over once he wouldn’t go to bed until he knew her and I weren’t sleeping together. He literally stayed up all night lurking. He got mad at her when she expressed wanting more male friends in her life. I mean he had a fucking fit! He still texts me pissed about that. He makes passive aggressive remarks about homosexuality to her and believes women are here to have babies. My friend hasn’t been with a woman in years because her life got pretty fucking crazy for a while and she had some health issues on top of that. That is none of his business though. He makes it his business. Last week he text me and said “if she likes women then why doesn’t she have sex with them or pursue them?” He doesn’t understand the spectrum of asexuality either which she pretty much falls on. He also says that because he got close with her he feels he deserves a chance with her since they get along so well.... anyways so yesterday I visited her at their place because I was in town. I didn’t text him about it because truth be told, he’s been extra weird lately. (He’s been bashing her through texts constantly and is trying to get close to me which is weird as shit. I’m finding out from her that he’s blowing our friendship out of proportion trying to make her jealous). So he showed up before I left and acted really really weird. He didn’t say anything when we greeted him and acted suspicious. We left very shortly after he got home and he text us both separately that it was weird how fast we left (playing like he was joking) then what I thought was joking turned into actual anger/anxiety on his part. He was telling me he felt like a stranger in his own home, was bashing my friend, saying we were hiding something from him...like what the fuck?! Who does he think he is?! So he started fact checking her and I and commenting on the timing of our text messages to him....I have half a mind to fucking punch him next time I see that goddamn loser. He apologized but he officially crossed the line. Am I wrong for wanting to end the friendship and wanting my best friend to move out ASAP?",08Oct2019,1

8,"Heyo. I just found out I didn't pass the bar exam. Can't decide if I find a new job in an alternate career path and make more money or stay where I'm at paycheck to paycheck and take the exam again.
Background: I work for a great small firm as a legal assistant. Non profit serving low income folks. I Love it and it and it being a nonprofit, together with my loan set up, might meet the public loan forgiveness requirements. I'm a fifth way through the ten year goal. 190k in debt (law school was expensive). Worked in law throughout undergrad and grad school. Worked 50 hours per week while studying for the bar, couldn't afford a lap top, and clearly didn't set myself up for success. I am forlorn. I don't make good money at the nonprofit but I am proud to work there and truly enjoy helping people in the ways that we do plus the co workers/boss are great. 
I could stay where I am at and take the exam again and hope for placement at the firm upon passing or find a new career that makes better money now but give up the fifth of time in the forgiveness plan. 
I got a law degree because of the versatility. I worked so much while studying because I'm living paycheck to paycheck. I make twice as much teaching lessons as I do being a legal assistant but, for teaching, the schedule can be rough and taxes in spring as an independent contractor are bad. I am  overqualified for my current pay at the firm and the challenges I take on but love the work. Help Reddit...what do I do? Side note: I studied only 20% of what I should (calculated by a study course) and only failed by 20 points. Also, the bar exam costs $700 and two workdays to take it.",08Oct2019,1

15,"A bit of convolution in this writing, so forgive me.

My mother died 12 years ago, shortly after the birth of my daughter. Her death was unexpected (reaction to medication she was taking for psoriasis), and me with an infant it wasn't easy to deal with. 

When arranging to deal with her ashes, my brother asked me what days I was unavailable to go to a funeral service. She wanted her ashes to be released to the sea. I told him the days that I would not be able to attend (I was travelling for work a lot). He booked the service for one of those days (he's always been an asshole).

As it turns out, and no one informed me about this until last week, her ashes were never released due to a storm. My mother's husband (another asshole, he's not my father) took them home, then stopped all contact with my family. Because he won't return contact, no one knows where my mother's ashes are. My mother's sister wants to find them to finally fulfill my mother's wishes.

...

My parents divorced when I was 13, in 1983.

This spring my father passed away after an incredibly unhappy decade as he slowly went blind then slipped into dementia. Just before that decade he married a woman who mistreated him constantly throughout their marriage. When he was put into hospital she refused to pay for a taxi to go see him before he died because it was $15. I'll give a little leeway because she's been headed into dementia too, but she's a cast iron bitch and according to her kids was always that way. 

Since my siblings and I have our own lives, and were dealing with his death, and don't much care for her bullying behaviour, and were pissed off on the way she treated my dad...we were in minimal contact. This pissed her off so much that she won't allow us to have a service for him or have access to his death certificate or deal with his ashes.

We had talked about burying them in the town he spent most of his life. She wants to bury him at sea, which I'm sure he couldn't give a rat's ass about.

Keep in mind that none of us live within a 8 hours drive of the ocean.

...

I'm not really looking for a resolution to a question here. The situations are different, but connected. Maybe we'll get a hold of the ashes one day. Maybe both my parents will be buried at sea, though not together. Maybe, over the millennia, the atoms of my parents ashes will meet and say ""WTF."" to each other. Maybe my mother's asshole husband will sort his shit out. Maybe my father's asshole wife will die and her kids will ask us about what to do with my father's ashes. I don't know. I'll find some catharsis, or I won't, and I will eventually die.

I've written in my last will and testament that I do not want to be cremated. That, at least, will force everyone involved to sort their shit out immediately before I rot and stink. Hopefully.",08Oct2019,1

17," Hey I really don't know where to post this, so here goes. Several not-so-fun things have happened in my life lately and I would LOVE some input! I lost two of my best friends after my wedding, one because she was talking to one of my husband's friends (I guess somewhat cheating on her psychotic husband and her husband blamed me...she let him even though I didn't have anything to do with it..) and the other because she started dating an extremely possessive guy and dropped out of life all together. She also had a baby and never even told me (had to see it on facebook). Have any of you been through losing close friends and how do you deal? I am hurt every time I see their social media.

I got in a serious accident in my dream car exactly one month after I paid it completely off. Ended up very injured, horrible concussion (that has given me non stop headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light, the list goes on..), along with normal back neck shoulder jaw ear etc. injuries. I have permanent hearing loss (just confirmed), my hearing has not been the same since the accident. Overall it's just really depressing. And I have physios telling me how awesome I'm doing (my movement has improved) and it must ""just be your anxiety"" preventing me from healing (I don't want to drive just yet...and I haven't been sleeping since the accident). I don't have a history of anxiety but I feel like nobody aside from my concussion therapist believes that I am in pain everyday, or understands the seriousness of how it feels. I almost don't even want to go to appointments anymore because I don't want to see anyone. I feel like I am never going to get through this car crash aftermath. Any experience with this?!

My mom has been extremely awful to me lately. It's a whole other story, but screaming at me, telling me I'm a horrible person etc. because I am not excited to watch her house for her (for a week). It's an extreme amount of effort. The hurtful stuff she's saying lately is getting to me and I don't want to be around her. I'm avoiding her. I posted about this a while back, and reddit basically said she's a narcissist and I need to distance myself.

I feel like everyone in life is way further than us. We are in our mid thirties, still living in a tiny apartment (that recently had an assessment and major repairs, a leak and mold), and that we will never be able to sell because it has dropped so much in value. We don't have kids (yes we want kids). It just feels messed up. There's nothing I want more than space (a house) at the moment. We are working towards it but I have to pay my mom back for a ""loan"" she gave to ""Help out"" a while back, and then proceeds to hold over my head and throw in my face constantly. So I am literally paying more than a high end mortgage each month to pay it off as soon as possible and get her off my back.

I just feel extremely stressed out and I'm starting to truly feel like I'm just existing. I don't even know how to feel! I just want to hear what you all think about this, or any input to offer! Have any of you been through similar situations? It feels like a lot all at once. Thanks!",08Oct2019,1

26,"Sorry for the psychotic rant. Please give me your advice. I'm going crazy. I have been for years but it's getting worse and worse (still totally conscious but my thoughts are becoming more ""erratic""). I'm extremely lonely and isolated, and I fear it will never end because I'm scared to meet new people. I have no sense of belonging or emotional connection. I don't trust anyone. I have no purpose in life, no skill to offer the world. I have no passion for anything. I have no joy to spread. If anything I only spread negativity because I only see the down sides of things. And all of these symptoms worsen the other symptoms. I'm a defeatist. I seem to focus on the negative aspects of things. I'm hateful, racist, and sexist. I have knee jerk reactions and judge different kinds of people, instead of learning about who they Are as individuals. I can't connect with people. I can't process my emotions or communicate them (I fear they will be used against me) I can barely hold a conversation with the 2 friends I have. Everytime I talk to them I feel like I'm struggling to make them not hate me. I'm profoundly socially awkward. I also can't get a job because of this. Which lowers my self esteem a lot. No girl will ever love me because I'm a jobless, effeminate coward who can't talk to anyone. I can't even look them in the eyes. I'm scared to go outside. I don't leave the house for days at a time. Most of my problems would have never happened if I just had a healthy social circle in my teens and early twenties. It's incredibly hard to make friends as an adult, and especially for me because I have no experience with it and I struggled to do it even when I was a child. I have imposter syndrome. If I start to like anything I don't show it or let others know because it isn't 'legitimate'. I've never felt I belonged in any subculture or anything. I'm also addicted to porn which Reddit seems to think isn't a real addiction but whatever.

I've made other accounts asking for advice over the years. Most people say I should get therapy. But I really could never do that. I am skeptical of how that would fix it but that's not the issue. I can't talk to strangers about little things like the weather. How am I supposed to open up about all these things that a normal adult should have already figured out? My speech is stunted from years of isolation. I stutter and take a long time to form sentences. Its humiliating. And im depressed which makes it hard to shower and get out of the house at all. I really can't do it. I'm a socially inept, neurotic weirdo. Maybe if I drank a lot I could get the courage to walk in there.

I would do anything to feel a sense of joy. I would do anything for love. But there's no hope. I'm over the curve. Everyone my age has had sex, multiple girlfriends, many friends and social experiences. They've gone to college, they've done courageous things. They've learned skills and hobbies. I have nothing. No education or job experience. I wasted my youth (I would join the military but I'm too retarded) I have no prospects of a girlfriend. I don't know anyone. Even if I found someone who I could convince to like me, it would be because I'm dishonest and only showing my good side. I would be hiding how pathetic I am only to be revealed later. And it wouldn't lead to love and even if it did I would be unable to love them back, because I literally don't know how.

Thanks for reading. I can't believe this beautiful gift of life was wasted on me, and now I seriously want to end it after 8 years of thinking about it. Don't worry. I will not do it any time soon. I know I can always do it so there is comfort in that.

28,"For my literature class in college we’ve been reading In Cold Blood, and since we’ve started it, I’ve been feeling so insanely sensitive to human cruelty and crime in general. I just don’t understand how someone could kill another person, or be so intentionally cruel. 
I even started crying to my boyfriend telling him all of this, even thinking about squashing a bug intentionally feels like an unnecessary death. A factor could be my other conservation biology classes, where I learn to appreciate the intricate workings of plants and animals. So I just feel to deeply hurt when I hear true crime stories, or even when I hear about 
 mean things people say to each other.

29,"Hello all, I am just going to get straight to the point here because I really don't know what to do. 

To start off, I am a 20 Y/O male. I have no direction and no drive and it's really weighing down on me.  I have so many ideas, ""hobbies"", ""passions"" but for some reason I just can't stick to anything.  I can tell I am having the pressure put on me by my parents because I have dropped out of community college twice.  I always get so interested in something and so motivated to do something for a maximum of 2-3 days.  Then it drops off, and no matter what I can't stick to it.  I have had 7 jobs over the past 3 years and I can never get to a point where I just ""do it"".  My parents and SO say I just need to ""buckle down"", ""find a direction"", ""find your passion"".  I am just so impulsive and so eager in the beginning but it just fades so quickly.  I see all my friends progressing whether that be, continuing college, starting a business, or even working their jobs. But overall they just do it, they do what they have to do.  I on the other hand lose interest so quickly that I feel like i'm never going to get anywhere.  For example, I have some serious impulsivity problems.  Such as I started to get into drawing, well, $500 in art supplies and 3 days later I was done with it.  I did the same with camping, programming, fishing, running, body building, college, etc.  I always just give up even though I have the support of everyone around me.  I am really starting to let people down and I have no clue where to go.  I really am at a loss here, I feel like others can just do what needs to be done.  But no matter how many people tell me to ""buckle down"", I just can't do it.  When I was in college I couldn't even be bothered to read a textbook chapter more than a few paragraphs before my brain just wasn't taking in any more information.

30,"July 21, 2019...it was the day that my youngest baby girl came to this world. It's supposed to be a day  when I would hear her cry and the day when I would first hold her and carry her but instead I saw her looking back at me but lifeless. Instead of carrying her w/ her in her baby blanket, I was allowed to lie beside her but her inside a little box. I felt numb. I wanted to shout. I wanted to tell the doctors to bring her back to life. My heart was bursting in pain. But I had to gather my strength and tell my dad to bring her home. I know she deserves to go home even for just a bit..even if she cant stay home for a long time. 

Losing my Aleyah changed me forever. 

Losing her made me want to be better. I cant do anything for her anymore now that she is gone. But I want to make sure that when my time comes that I would be able to be with her. It may sound like a cliche but its true. I didnt want to self destruct because I want to make sure that I can be with her when the time comes. I dont want her to cry because she cant be with me during the Resurrection morning. I want to see her smile on that day. 

Losing her made me want to live my life. Sitting in the hospital bed for 4days carrying her but lifeless made me realize how precious life is..you may breathing now but may not be true anymore after an hour. Before losing her, I was carrying alot of baggage--grudges, pain, hate--name it and i have it. I was full of resentment. But losing her made me realize that life is so short to be spent feeling bitter about everything and wasting life trying to get back at people or things. She made me want to live my life rather than letting it go by.

..You will always be in my heart my baby love. Mama will remain strong for u and your sister. Mama will be better so she can be with you in the future..

34,"Let me lay out the main points as to why I think this may be the case.

1. I'm 18, and I haven't managed to develop even basic living skills. Case in point: I use cutlery in an (admittedly inefficient) way that most other people consider strange and I have no clue how to tie a shoelace. I get mentally overwhelmed by unfamiliar tasks very easily regardless of how simple they are and struggle with them excessively.
2. My social skills are completely and utterly nonexistent. When others are talking I find it extremely difficult to keep up with what they have said and find it nearly impossible to know what to say in response. I don't know how to hold a conversation if that conversation is about something I don't have a special interest in. I can't do small talk and my social life is nonexistent.
3. My executive functioning is terrible. I lose focus and get distracted easily, and take an extremely long time to learn very simple concepts that I suspect that others could pick up easily. I don't retain information well unless it's on topics I'm personally interested in. I have forgotten a sizeable amount of what I've learned in university. I constantly question my own knowledge about things and whether I really understand them, even extremely basic maths and statistics.
4. More or less every day there is a distinct sensation of cloudiness/fuzziness in my head and all my thoughts are lacking clarity as if my head was filled with fog. I get distracted, turned around and confused easily and I feel only vaguely present most of the time. Throughout the day a distinct feeling of lethargy and fatigue follows me around - regardless of what I do to dispel it - and I find it hard to focus or gather up the energy to actually get around to doing things. I hardly have any moments of clarity.
5. I have this horrible tendency to obsessively focus on a couple of special topics and activities that I am interested in and shut out everything else. Sometimes these are the only things my mind can think about, and it can lead to me neglecting important matters.

Because of 1) 2) 3) 4) and 5) above I find it difficult to get a job or even leave the house on my own. I can't seem to handle matters or achieve milestones that other people are able to.",08Oct2019,10

Life is just so meaningless in any sort of extended period of time for me, so when I run out of things to keep it ‘meaningful’ enough for me in the short term I feel like even worse shit?  I’m a lost cause really, someone nobody should know, or love.  A waste of time and space, a waste of life and resources.  So many people actually like life and they don’t get to keep it, so why am I the one to keep living?  Others have people who love and depend on them and they die, I am a burden and I live.

2. Often when we are out in public, men will insinuate he is going to have ""a really good time later"". I truly think this is just because we are an interracial couple these comments stem from fetishization. 
3. My boyfriend also claims men always check me out - I think this is in his head and since he believes I'm a 10 he seeks validation for his viewpoint
4. My boyfriend's claims all his friends agree I'm hot, even the ones who don't consider me their type. - Would his friend's call me ugly? I wouldn't tell any of my friends their SO is ugly unless they had hurt him/her.
5. I've never had a boyfriend before, not to say men haven't been interested in me, but my boyfriend and I started dating when I was 22. Isn't that kind of late for a ""10""?

I guess to be fair to his side, here are four of his arguments that I can't refute

1. A few men have congratulated him for ""bagging me""
2. All of his exes are pretty hot, why would he start dating an average girl? 
3. Many guys I have casually dated are pretty obsessed with me to this day, but I personally attribute this to my personality.
4. Many girls are attractive and don't realize it. This is definitely true, my most attractive friends are weirdly the most insecure.",08Oct2019,1
42,"Im 22m. I’m a law student in my second year. I have mental health issues, just got over an episode of depression. I have debt, had to move back to my parents‘ place (temporarily until end of year). I need some vacation. I haven’t been away for over a year and my mind longs for some rest. I’m confused about what I want and what to think. I need to change myself back to who I was because I’ve lost perspective. This would be fine but I feel like I can’t do that unless I get a few days to myself first. I love my mum but I don’t have any space here. I lived away for 2 years and it’s hard to be back home, but granted it’s only been a week. 

I’m trying really hard not to be sad, to see the good things about my life. I know they’re there. But it’s difficult. Moving out of my shared flat I lost my favorite roomie who was also my best mental health buddy and made me feel safe and liked. More so than all my other friends that I’ve known for 7-10 years. 
My roomie will be moving out forever in like a good week, we promise each other that we are still going to hang out but who knows? We have sort of a difficult history and I feel like I’m always the one trying (because she has trust issues and I get it but I just want some effort from her, too). 

I hate uni atm. None of my lectures are interesting (except legal philosophy) and I’m thinking of not going to uni anymore and just studying the stuff at home. It will go faster I think. 

I usually hang out with my friends every day. I don’t anymore because I feel I need more time to myself. The past days I’ve just been sleeping a lot which I guess makes sense because I probably haven’t gotten enough sleep in the past 2 years. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this. Just some thoughts that I had to let out I guess. Sorry for the lame content and lack of structure lol. Hope you guys have a good day!",08Oct2019,8

My sister is 20 years old. I am 22. We had never been close in a friendly way. We fought a lot growing up. We have been on good terms for only the past few years. And that's when I don't think about the hundreds of dollars she owes me, or how she consistently threw me under the bus growing up. But that's just sibling stuff.

Now she's pregnant. I don't know if it was planned or not. She seems really happy about it. I mean she has very few reasons not to be. She's been with her boyfriend for years now. He has a great stable job with the military. She just got her second associates degree.

She's really young imo. But that's no reason to not wish her a healthy pregnancy and baby.

I can't have kids. I don't know why but I just can't.

""You're just trying too hard!"" 

I'm not trying at all, but my fiancé hasn't pulled out in years. I can't say that to people.

I feel so shitty. I feel so worthless and stupid. I don't even have the money to afford a child. But I've wanted one for as long as I could remember.

My SIL just had a child as well. Her and my BIL can barely afford to feed their toddler, but they don't have a problem having another. 

I can't have kids and my soul feels like it's crying. My little sister is pregnant and I feel horrible for only thinking about myself.",08Oct2019,1
50,"So, they perform on Feb 2, 2020 in San Jose. They’ve been huge inspirations in my song writing, dancing, singing, and piano.

They launched a tour with a group in the USA which is rare. I was super excited, but I full well knew I wouldn’t be able to get to tickets. I’m 17 and have little to no money (no establishments want to hire me yet until I’m 18, which I will be in less than a month, but I did have an interview for a clothing store for the holiday season this week). Tickets originally sold for $225 for a VIP package, but most are sold out at face value or are being resold 5 times the original price. 

I really didn’t want to get bad seats, I wanted to be up close since I’ve been a fan for about 10 years, but the resell cost is $1,500 (fucking wild, right?). I was sad, but I shrugged my shoulders because well, oh well.

I could work my ass off at this seasonal job and, sure, I could end maybe making $1,200 and spend all that on one ticket or even spend $200 maybe for a lower level ticket, but I started thinking if I really want to do that. Do I really want to work 2-3 months, resist spending any of it, then splurge it all on a floor ticket to a concert that I’ll be going alone where some fans are maniacs (K-Pop fans...) for one night, plus being on my feet all night to see them.

And I think the reason why I want floor tickets is for the members to possibly interact with me, but the chance is just unpredictable. I mean, maybe, but all that work for one night when I could spend that on a desktop set up and new clothes (since my old one has finally died out and my wardrobe is becoming a bit dull), it seems like having a desktop set up is worthwhile than a concert night.

Yeah, I know: experiences &gt; materialistic things but being on the floor in front of mobbing fans... I’ve come to realize that, you know what, my inspirations don’t need to see me to make me feel validated. 

I’ll feel validated when I’ve taken what I feel inspired from them and apply it to my own works in song writing, dancing, piano, etc.",08Oct2019,3

Second thing, we have been suffering financially and in Pakistan, parents pay for their children's tuition even in uni, so we (my mother and i) asked higher or maybe they highest authority in our uni to help us with this semester's fee.

52,"I do enjoy some people, but with the majority of people I find it really difficult to enjoy being with them, for various reasons. Maybe I’m too critical, maybe I’m just a bitch.

I have a boyfriend, I like his family. I have a job, I like the people there. Maybe all I need is to get to know others and then I’ll like them. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this, I just need to put it out there. I’m lonely. I need friends, but I struggle to connect with others and maybe that struggle is due to the fact that I have my guards up so high that I give off a bad vibe. 

This post won’t be cohesive sorry, but due to recent events I’ve had a fair bit to process today and I am a bottle of wine deep, so I probably won’t make sense and I’ll likely delete this later because I sound like a drama queen. 

Anyway, my mum didn’t hug me properly as a kid. Weird opening, I know, but it kinda prefaces how my childhood was. I always thought that I had a decent childhood, but the fact that as an adult I can’t have sex without feeling shame and I can’t tell my parents how I’m feeling makes me think about what happened in my childhood. 

One big thing that comes to mind is that I was sexually attracted to both girls and boys when I was younger. Still am- shocker. I wrote it in my diary, which my mum saw, and she made me feel guilty about it. 

When I got my first period, she told me to be quiet about it. 

Her reactions to everything are blown out of proportion so I feel like I can’t tell her anything. 

I can’t tell anyone anything. My boyfriend gets annoyed, my dad is my dad and I don’t want him to be worried, and I don’t want to burden my friends that I do have. 

Sorry for the rant. I went from wishing that I could enjoy others to blaming my mother and my childhood.

# The strangest things that seemed like a dream, but turned out to be reality

  
I'll start. My memories of this ""Dream"" began about 5 years ago. it was pretty weird: my aunt's wedding, it comes in blood, it's all retro. it seemed to me that all this was just my stupid dream, which was preserved as a memory(I have this happens sometimes), but recently I asked my mother if there was such a thing. and so it was! at my grandmother's birthday party when I was 3 years old.

61,"It was pretty interesting.

-

I accidentally made a British princess interested in me and ended up confronting my attitude toward monarchy and the value of human life. I ended up conflicted because of how desperately I wanted her to stay. She was super pretty and had a nice personality but the thought of ""I just said a week ago that I wanted to kill her mother"" never left my mind. I have a huge fear of abandonment, but theoretically I was just in it for the money. Practically though, I knew I really liked her and every time she looked away from me I panicked.

There was this one moment where I wanted to show off that I was fluent in Spanish to surprise her, and then I faltered when I realized she was probably extremely educated. All the subtle details were really expressed in that dream.

65,"My girlfriend recently told me that she wants to have an open relationship. We live together.

I'm fine with that, sex is just sex and if it makes our relationship stronger all the better. Our sex life has not always been the best- various reasons (Kids, medical stuff, etc). 

I expressed an interest that I'd rather do things as a couple. Couples that have sex together stay together? She was pretty adamant about doing things separately reasoning she's bi and women are harder for couples. I'm not the jealous type and am fine with the sex part.

So, the reason for the post is that I inadvertently found out that she has already slept with a guy. The huge betrayal I feel comes in 2 parts:

1. She lied to me and said she was going to work. We had agreed that communication is important and she went out of the way to not tell me about it.
2. Their messages got really personal, talking about our relationship. She commented that she wanted to get married again, but not to me. Yes. That's what it said.

So, basically not having slept last night I'm not sure what to do. At this point there doesn't seem to a point in staying in the relationship and I should just move out. I have not talked to her about this yet. I'm much calmer then I was last night, but I'm still sorting feelings. Honestly,  her comments to essentially a stranger have broken my heart.

Almost one year ago (20 days till full year) i started diet. At first it was just to show that I can lose weight if I want to, but never wanted to do it. But I got into it. 

I lost about 56kg(123lbs) in that time and i clearly mark this as a some kind of success. But here is the thing: I wanted to lose 5kg/month and with 4kg(8.8lbs) and 20 days left I don't think that I can do it. I'm aware that what i have accomplished so far is good, but i set up my mind for different goal (60kg in 1 year) and now seeing that i won't be able to do this is crushing me.

With this failure I'm reminded that whatever I do, I fail at it. Maybe not entirely fail, but **I'm never doing it at 100%**.

75,"So I really struggle with dating. I’m 21, a little socially awkward, not entirely ugly but I’m a short ass, which doesn’t help me with tinder or other online dating apps. I don’t really like them anyway, I do get some matches, but they never go anywhere at all. It feels so hard to get to know someone that way. I’ve come to realise the big issue for me is that I see hundreds of women who catch my eye, but approaching them in a way that is sensitive to the fact that they deal with creepy, shitty guys day in day out, and managing to break past that barrier and get to know them is basically impossible. Because of this, I just never try get to know girls I think are attractive. It just seems like a crazy idea to me at this point. I should probably mention to begin with that I completely understand that women tend to have their guard up around guys they don’t know for a very sensible and understandable reason. It’s the creepy pieces of shit who go out their way to terrorise women that are the root cause of all this. it’s completely normal to feel like this. I feel however that this is a problem not just for me, but probably hundreds of normal, everyday guys out there, who mean well but just have no idea how to approach women while being respectful of how weird it is to be approached by a stranger.

Like, how the fuck do people meet each other these days man? It’s a mystery to me. After school finishes it just becomes seemingly impossible to meet anyone to date. In class at college I try keep to myself, and try not to sit next to any girls I find interesting cause I don’t want to be that creep that sits trying to flirt with them when they’re just trying to get a degree. I wouldn’t want to date a co-worker, for obvious reasons. Online dating completely sucks as a way to meet someone unless you’re intrinsically good looking, especially for guys. Average looking guys just dont get that many matches, and women get too much to the point that they have to be pretty picky about who they want to match with. It’s kind of a broken system. I’ve never been the type to try have a drunken hookup with some girl I meet in a club, again people just aren’t that attracted to me until they see a glimpse of my personality, and that can take time, and it’s hard to get that across shouting over the music at some stranger you don’t know. That leaves the same group of girls I’ve been friends with for years, who I see most weekends and have had some flirtations with over the years, but I know that none of them really see me as dating material. I’m at a point in my life where I need to meet some new girls and start dating, but I’m completely stumped as to how to even go about it.

It basically leaves a few options that all just seem crazy. Basically, just approaching any girl you find interesting or ‘sliding into the dms’ of someone you kind of vaguely know, which just seem ridiculous to me. Like no girl wants to be approached by some random guy when they’re going about their business, and no girl wants some stupid reply guy filling their dm’s up with stupid hollow attempts to get to know them.

I really just don’t have a clue how to meet girls. I’m not a completely lost cause; I’m not some fedora wearing neckbeard. I’m a little socially awkward, and it can take time to get to know me, but aren’t we all like that? It’s just that the girls I know well have known me for so long they see me as just a friend, a drunken hookup at the very very best, and me being a little socially awkward means that meeting new people is something I overthink to hell. I see what girls put up with all the time, with random guys approaching them on nights out and hopelessly trying to flirt with them when they’re just trying to get on with their day, and I never want to do that. So, my question is: how the fuck do you meet people to date? It sounds simple, but it’s completely beyond me. I just wish it was as simple as seeing a girl you’re attracted to, saying hey, and getting to know them. I wish the world could be that friendly, but everyone has their guard up these days (for good reason) and it just doesn’t work that way man.",08Oct2019,5
76,"We had to submit our work last week during class and we got them back today. It’s not graded but our prof will indicate if we’re on track or not. 


Backstory, In my friend group of 3, friend A and I are the dumber ones. We always say this about ourselves because as compared to friend B, B is very good at our major. She can write something last minute and still get an A+. She understands concepts perfect and very quickly. She can do a test in 30 minutes and get good grades while others take twice the time. Bottom line is, B is very smart and good at what she’s doing. I’ve been struggling with this module since week 1 and I think I’ve put in a sizeable amount of effort into it but I keep feeling like it’s not enough and I’m not on track. Whenever we have discussions among ourselves, A and B can understand the concepts and discuss about it on a higher level. While I sit there extremely confused and struggling, barely understanding, that I need much more time to sit and think about it. Which makes me think that A and B are on the same intelligence level. Whenever A asks me something to clarify, I can’t give an answer. Because I really don’t know. 


However, today, when we got our work back, albeit it being ungraded, it was indicated that I was not on track. Well, expected of me because I still think I’m struggling.

87,"My best friend was the one to discover one of their housemates had committed suicide this morning. I knew the other person, not well, we followed each other on social media, we'd watched films together, had meals together, shared cigarettes. Enough for me to feel knocked off kilter by their passing.

My best friend has been really close to them since starting uni 2 years ago and they've lived together for that time. When I heard that *something* had happened, my mind jumped immediately to this so I suppose that's some comfort that it wasn't completely out of the blue. I'm scared that the other side of that is that people close to them will feel like they should have done more?

The whole thing is just odd. I feel odd. Not close enough to be allowed to grieve but close enough to have a panic attack hide in the toilet shaking? I want to support my best friend but I'm not in *that* circle that's been directly, acutely effected so I'm very much *outside* right now. And they're high walls.

I'm not against suicide and I believe it's important that it's an option to people - you should have the right to choose your own path and take ownership of the direction of your life. I'm just angry and scared and so so sad that this person decided to choose that option. Not at them, but at everything that led to it. It's just an accumulation of marginal losses though. Too many things for me to even thing about fixing. It makes me worry that maybe I don't know with the people I'm directly close to, what kind of marginal losses they face themselves. What is the straw that breaks the camels back? How can I trust people to communicate those things with me when I don't talk to anyone when I'm suicidal?

Dying is weird. Death is weird. This whole thing is exhausting. I just wish I could make everyone feel okay.",08Oct2019,1
88,"I met some people at an event I wasn't even supposed to be at. We talked a bit. I realised I knew one of them cause we worked together some time ago. We exchanged numbers. Today we talked through text about how much fun the event was and he said me and the other people (who I met at the event) are hanging out tomorrow, come join us for a drink. Normally I say no, I can't read social situations because of my autism and can't tell if people mean it when they invite me to something or if they are just being nice so I won't feel left out but they don't actually want me to come. This time I said yes. This is going to be a one time thing, they don't know I have autism but longer than an hour in my company and they'll start to notice I'm different. But I don't mind. I don't have any friends and haven't had friends for a long time. I'm going to enjoy myself to the fullest tomorrow and pretend, just for the night, to have friends. Superrr excited!

89,"I've always been kinda an odd ball. Growing up in school I was much slower than my classmates in learning, I had speech issues, I would pronounce my ""L"" as ""Y""(I yove you). I would day dream in class all day and focus on some part of the room because I couldn't stand learning so I ended up being put in a special ed class where I could understand all the concepts my teacher tried to teach me. I barely passed kindergarden because doing something as simple as crafts was tough. A teacher told me to cut between the lines and instead I changed the way I held the scissors. 

I've also always been very blunt and I speak my mind ir say something in a very ""matter of fact"" fashion. I would always get in trouble and I'd get irritated because I didn't know what I did was wrong. When it came to video games I would always ocd check them to make sure they didnt have scratches otherwise I'd lose my mind at school. 

When it came to relationships I was pretty normal up until middle and high. I had a hard time with the stereotypical desires of that age range. I liked sex and what that entailed and I was not asexual at all. But I had a hard time with hook ups because I had the unshakable belief that I was being used for sex. I don't condemn people for that culture and way of life but I didnt know how to engage. I also didnt like getting in relationships for the hell of it to gain experience because I overthink; ""what if they end up falking hard for me and i dont feel the sake way because its casual"" etc. I needed to be in love. It might also be rooted in a rough early childhood with bullies that made me self concious too. I did also got Type 1 Diabetes when I was 12 and it might of shook me in some ways. 

As I became an adult I had a hard time staying motivated and the only way I can explain it - is I have a bunch of energy but I hated staying in one spot and commiting to a task or working. It's like I have this weird headache and want to stay home and do nothing even though I have energy. Then I'll get weird energy spikes and I will do all those things abd get tired. I also pace alot. I like to do it and cant help it. 

Something as simple as applying to jobs is complicated. Because I'll sit and overthink everything and wonder ""What if i apply at a bunch of different jobs and they all call me back at once and I go to each interview and they all ask if i want the job after they give it and i have to lie to one of them and i dont like lying but i need to get to the other job interview blah blah blah"". Or I'll think if this job will allow me to have any down time and lose the free time i have for school? I'm not really lazy but I don't think to do something or feel like i cant sit and do it. 

I'm naturally an anxious person and I overthink, I get panicky, I think the worst before the good etc. I also do get depressed. I'm not suicidal but I wonder if I have some underlying mental illness. My brother has autism but I doubt I have it. I understand social cues and what not. I just don't think thats my issue but I'm open to being corrected. What do y'all think?",08Oct2019,1

94,"Tl;Dr: I'm terrified about people (around me) 's attitudes​ about HK.​

I'm not sure if this is a topic allowed to be discussed here, but I really have no where to talk about this issue in my life. This is a throwaway account I just created for posting this because I'm afraid of people know my main account will trace back to me in real life.

I'm from mainland China and I'm studying in U.S. for my undergraduate right now. I'm not exaggerating, but literally everyone around me and all people on the Chinese Internet blame the HK protestors and think they are violent terrorist or ""trash youth"" (废青). The official newspapers spread the fake news to slander the protesters.(For example, they claimed that the girl who was shot into her eye was shot by another protester). No voice of supporting HK is allowed, not even some neutral voices that only ask people to take a moment to think of HK people's appeals. I said something support HK people on Weibo, and I was doxed by some extreme nationalist people, insulted(They call me prostitute bitch) and threatened. I was too scared so I delete anything that related to my personal information online.

I feel very much lonely, not emotionally, but politically. My parents blame the students too even though they went through 8964. Some of my friends are understanding, or would ask me what's happening in HK, which I'm really grateful. But I cannot talk to them on WeChat with them because all media in China is strictly monitored. 

Everyone seems to be so happy about the 70th birthday of the authority. I can't be happy about the dictator. I can't pretend to be happy. I'm sad. I'm sad that people are celebrating to the ruler that limits their freedom and oppresses them. I don't want to be too radical, but the authority is in fact the enemy of people right now. Not only in HK, but the whole China. But people feel happy pretending that the authority is their ""Mother"" and protecting themselves. I'm not able to deceiving myself. 

But I don't know what could I do. I only can support HK people deep in my heart. I follow the news. I try my best to speak up a little bit on the Chinese internet, even though they might got deleted very soon. But I can do nothing else. I don't want to go back to China, honestly. It's like back to the Cultural Revolution. People are resisting NBA, which is really...stupid. I even see somebody online that even server his relationship with his father because his father is a big fan of the Rockets and wants to continue to be their fun. I really hope this is a fake story....

This whole country is fucking crazy. Please excuse my words. What bothers me most is not people inside the GFW, it is my fellow Chinese students that are studying abroad and have numerous accesses to learn about what is happening in HK. But they choose to read People's Daily anyway. They choose to stay being fooled. 

I can very much feel the people who committed suicide in HK. It's so hopeless. I have no choices but to see the things getting worse and worse everyday.",08Oct2019,17
95,"A very close friend of mine broke up with her boyfriend of 3 years about a month ago. They had been fighting for a while and the break up wasn’t a surprise to anyone except her and she took it extremely hard. I was always there for her and tried my absolute best to be supportive. However, the past few weeks she has been ghosting me and canceling plans on me so I called her out on it. I told her that she has been very distant and that it comes off as she doesn’t want to be friends. So, she told me that she hadn’t been eating, sleeping, or going out because she’s broken due to the break up. She turned it around on me and said if I don’t want to be friends with her I don’t have to and that it’s unreasonable for me to expect her to reach out to me and let me know she’s alright.

112,"When I was young my mo m used to have one of those multiplication charts (which I also hate seeing now) like the ones you might have had in a classroom that went up to twelve. Everyday before school we had to memorize it, usually 6 to 9 . She would make me and my brother say it out loud and if we made a mistake she hit us. 

It scared me a lot. When we did multiplication in school it made me uneasy. I wasn’t confident at math and I had to go to a special program thingy because i was behind.

I dated her for more than a year and the relationship was a mess. She constantly accused me of cheating and being an asshole. She broke up with me and that was it... never heard of her again. Now that I started 12th grade she started talking to me again and I gave in and started talking to her. I fell for her again and she “fell” for me too, we got back together and after not even a month she broke up with me saying she couldn’t like me and she can’t force herself too and left. Fast forward and about a week ago she tries to get back with me and tells me she hates herself for leaving. I give her a chance and we start talking... she is being sweet and all but this shit still doesn’t make sense. Im talking to her best friend and she is a really good friend of mine too and her friend shows me that everything since the beginning of this school year was a plan to gather information from me like things about me smoking joints and to break me emotionally. She showed me the evidence to prove it and I was heartbroken... she still thinks I don’t know anything and we’re talking as if we were a couple but she is sweet to me but in her conversations with her friend she is doesn’t care about me and genuinely hates me. She talks so much shit about me there too and she tells everyone im a fuckboy who cheats and plays with her yet I genuinely never did those things and tried my best with her, gave it all... 

After this im just disappointed because I put so much trust in her. I wan’t to tell her that I know everything and just show her how fucked up she is but I can’t because then her friend will be fucked badly since she can ruin her life in seconds with everything she has.

122," 

I believe he adapted in his own way to the pain and suffering he was experiencing through child hood and into adult hood. For what he went through he was still striving to be ultimately good to his fellow man. I believe he was kinder, more gentle, honest and more down to earth then most of the characters in the movie including Murray.

His adaptation as much as it was necessary for him to survive and makes sense of the world around him was not fitting to the world he was living in. Similar to how PTSD is benefit to someone in war or an abusive relationship, being conditioned is also a detriment to living outside of war or in a relationship that is not abusive. The problems are as much of a problem for Arthur as much as they are for society, but Arthur was consistently and proactively seeking assistance from a system that was suppose to offer assistance but ultimately not only gave up on him but punished him for growing up and living through a painful life.

I believe the laughter was something in him growing out of the mess of his life. He was adapting to become functional within that mess, to have an identify and sense of control and trying to make sense of the irony of being so sad and having to be the one that makes people smile. He genuinely cared for people and had made great points and i'd even say strong arguments, but how he carried out his actions were wrong. He was confused and lonely most of his life, he imagined shit that didn't happen because he wanted to be vocal and social but was not able to, was never allowed too. That sense of self that was repressed came out in another way and one of the ways was to imagine himself in situations that most people would determine as being ""crazy"" or ""loony"" but to me they weren't crazy dream, they were expected for someone normal to have if  they were never able to develop those emotions and these emotions became confused in mixed up. 

I guess, lastly I draw on an analogy. It's like trying to learn to  play golf or a sport with others when you have never played a sport or done anything physical before.  Watching people play is confusing and you see things that appear one way but are actually done another way. When trying to emulate what you seen or just feel your way through something, a person can appear awkward and off beat and out of touch to those that have had some kind of guidance, training, or previous experience. For Arthur, his sport was life, socializing, feeling connected and having a sense of self. But he kept trying even until the end to achieve these things, and still, he authentically voiced how ""rude"" everyone was and did what he did to people who were not nearly as sincere. Essentially,throwing the golf clubs down and making his own rules that fit himself in a world or sport that wouldn't let him play. Its not easy to fit into a world were people have over a hundreds of years of combined socializing experience given to them by there parents, relatives, other family members and you are starting the sport without any support and having to figure out that there are rules and learn how to follow them and understand their meaning and reasoning's, every time the hard way, the weird way, the unnatural way, being the pun, the one who doesn't understand, not looked at but whispered about, watching and learning from social queues, yearning for a connection but always being the joker.",08Oct2019,7
