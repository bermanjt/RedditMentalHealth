Imagine thay one scene in infinity war where spiderman is jumping out of portals and hitting thanos, but one portal opens and deadpool pops out and headbutts thanos. Or theres a fight scene and hes not involved but  gets caught up in the collateral damage.,or just fucking around in the background of a scene.

It would Also double as a great replacement for Stan Lee cameos.",11Apr2019,91

3,"I fail to fully tuck in my chair? He all but explodes. I take a look out the blinds, mildly disturbing the broken one? He throws a fit. I'm so sick of him treating me this way. It seems I can hardly do ANYTHING right by him. Everything I do, according to him (and keep in mind I am a very responsible person, great student, and overall very organized/neat) is half-assed and sloppy. It's like he can barely stand to look at his pathetic failure of a daughter. 

Often, this makes me sad, but tonight I'm even more angry than sad. I screamed back at him, which I know only serves to escalate these types of situations, but I'm so fucking frustrated with how he treats me.",11Apr2019,1

5,"Well one of many. 
I was brought up with a catholic mindset. Virginity virginity virginity. I had no serious relationships but plenty of opportunities to have sex but I was waiting for my special one, my husband. Fast forward to 24 I get my first boyfriend and all of my senses go out of the window. Only a few months in and we are both drunk and I lose my virginity. Few months later and we break up and my mental health takes a plunge - like a big big plunge I was heartbroken and I also felt like how could I lose my virginity so soon how could I, oh my god I’m single and not a virgin all that for nothing etc etc etc. 

6/7 months after my break up I meet let’s call him T. T is gorgeous and a few months of talking we end up having sex - a year after I lost my virginity. We continue having sex a few times and I felt liberated and happy. For once I was happy that I was having sex and I felt ‘ normal ‘ and unashamed for being deflowered. 
Anyway that fizzles out as he ghosted me. 

A few months later, after being ghosted by T, I meet L. The love of my life. And I feel so bad those feelings of feeling bad are back as I wish wish wish I saved myself for him. I can’t help feeling if I weren’t drunk I wouldn’t have lost my V and now I feel so so bad for putting myself in that situation even though I have been drunk with several other guys in the past I mean I’m not totally irrational when drunk I still know right from wrong. 

This is seriously eating me up and I cannot function.

6,"I was walking home today from work and it’s /exceptionally/ windy. During my walk I saw a man lose his grip on his insulated delivery bag and it goes tumbling with the wind. Every time he’s about to catch it, the wind sends it rolling again. Thankfully the wind actually sent it towards me, so I ran into the path of the bag and caught it for him and gave it back to him. It actually made me laugh a little catching the bag, because it felt like I was catching a ground ball. He muttered thanks and I said no problem and we kept walking in opposite directions. 

It’s kind of a miserable day today but I hope it made any onlookers smile to themselves too.",11Apr2019,5

But I did I fell for her feels like I was in love I never clicked with someone so much before not even on just anime so many other things I wanted bff to be mine. Bf didn't like this not one bit, I knew she would be furious if she found out i was flirting and trying to get with bff but i did it anyway. Soon the guilt ate me up and I told bf she was understandably furious and didn't speak to me for a week but we got back to good terms. I was still trying to be with bff and evrytime I would bring up the subject of being with her bf would get mad at me and tell me I cant cuz she said I couldn't.

12,"I grew up in a small conservative town and my family was very non conformative. Very liberal politically, and just generally raised differently than most others. People didn’t like my sister, and she set a reputation for my family and I, so I wasn’t super well liked either. 

I’ve held onto my hometowns opinion of me for so long. I’m now 19, I haven’t gone to school in my hometown for about 5 years, but still hear the comments in the back of my mind. Always how I’m too; political, out there, annoying, etc. it’s never left my mind. So, in response, I built up this wall around me. I acted like everyone hated me so that when they said it, it wouldn’t effect me. I told people I was annoying because I didn’t want them to say it to me first. I let these opinions control my life. 

It turned me into a negative person with no friends. Putting out that hate into the world, it only came back to me. No one wanted to be friends with the person who clearly hated themselves and stated it. No one wanted to hear from the girl who would bash her hometown on social media. 

So, I’m making a new Instagram (my main social media). I’ll keep my old one, just not use it. Let it die with that negative part of me. I will only let people who love and support me follow the new one. I won’t be afraid to annoy people when I post. I won’t feel like everyone hates me all the time. I won’t feel annoying. I will live, and enjoy sharing my thoughts and photos because I know it’s people who truly care seeing them. I won’t worry about followers or likes. I will finally be free of this negative world I’ve been living in. I will be happy. I will love myself again.",11Apr2019,15

15,"Was after a long time of unemployment finally offered a long term substitute position with good chances of a longer contract for next year.
I have loved this job, even though I’m not 200% qualified and the learning curve was steep.
Found out yesterday that they hired somebody for ”my” job. During lunch one of my co-workers hugged me and said they were sorry I didn’t get the position adding: ”considering the first person they interviewed said no and the other one took so long to accept....”
So they basically kept me wondering while interviewing other people (granted, more qualified). It made me feel like I am some kind of consolation prize. 
The department boss said they have nothing against my work and that I have done my job perfectly. I cried on my way home in the car.

Since nobody said anything, I applied for other positions, went to an interview that seemed really promising, even though it was part-time.
Today they call me to tell me they sadly hired somebody else. So that’s a second day crying on my way home in the car.

I know this happens to everybody from time to time, but man, it really hurts.

I have a department transfer interview scheduled next week and I would do almost anything to stay, but I’m at the point where I have lost all hope. I feel like I’m back to square one, no job and no prospects. I’m applying for a minimum of 5 jobs per day now and I’m prepared to cut my earnings in half if I have to.

It’s really hard keeping up appearances and smile and go on for another month, pretendent like I don’t care and do a great job. Even trying  to not be a whimp and sob at the lunch table is hard.

How do you pick yourself up and get back out there? Right now I just want to stay in bed and feel miserable, but I don’t have any sick leave in my contract so even one day off is costly.

I am extremely close with my father in that we both suffer very similarly.  But I very much struggle with wanting his validation when it comes to things I so desperately want to believe about myself.  I will worry that he does not believe these things in me and it makes me feel really bad about myself.  My own common sense tells me that this pain is just my body calling to me to let go of having another human being control my mind and dictate what to believe. about myself  But at the same time when i'm around him sometimes I will feel bad about myself and I hate that and it will ruin our time together.

This little idea has the potential to turn things around if you're stuck, struggling or thinking of giving up on something. Some people get lucky and their environment just falls together by chance to make them more resilient. But many have to assemble it themselves and targeting each key part will help you get there sooner.

24,"So I'm depressed. This is something my therapist and I have covered PLENTY of times. I'm also an enlisted programmer in the Air Force. On top of that, all I want to do in life is make music, movies, and comedy. Lately it just feels like depression and the military have just sucked all the creativity out of me. I either A: don't have time to work on my creative exploits or B: just can't muster the creativity and motivation to do anything I want to do. I'm only 20 years old and it feels like I'm already giving up on my dreams. I only joined so that I wouldn't have hungry nights anymore and so I could get an education. However, I'm stuck in it for another 5 years. I literally just sit in a room all day waiting for someone to give me a mundane task they don't feel like doing (such as vacuuming, pulling weeds, taking out trash, giving random people rides, etc.). I don't even do my job because due to circumstances beyond my control, I have to wait on that. Well, I've waited for 9 months. I haven't done anything (other than get engaged to one of my only two joys in life). I'm getting fat. I'm losing interest in things. I already go to counseling, but it's just not enough. I feel stuck in a rut. All I want to do is be able to go home, sit down, and start working on a song or something, but I just sit down and play video games or watch YouTube videos or something then go to bed only to wake up and repeat it. I mentioned two joys earlier and I hang onto those very tightly; those being my fiancee and D&amp;D. The only thing is, my fiancee enlisted shortly after we started dating and now SHE'S miserable and stuck in training for a job she never wanted. I'm not looking for a magical solution to solve all my problems, but I really would like to be able to just sit down and have a creative outlet. Has anyone here been in a similar emotional state and still been able to work on something they love?

(Btw, I am NOT considering suicide. I really do have a lot to live for and have, at one point, enjoyed life before and would rather work on making it to the point where I do enjoy it again rather than know I'll never see the day where I'm truly somewhat happy again.

26,"Last week my body started doing all kinds of wack shit. I woke up and had bruises all over my arms and legs without ever doing anything. The next night I tested how easily I was bruising by lightly banging my forearm against the table and by morning there was a huge bruise there. My lymph nodes in my armpit are huge. I’ve felt so sluggish, achey all over, and I nearly fainted yesterday. 

I looked up “strangely easy bruising and swollen lymph nodes” and literally got slammed with things about leukemia. And I read the symptoms and was like ohhh shit that all makes sense. I thought I’d been losing weight/not quite feeling right cause I’ve been pretty depressed but I don’t know. 

I also can’t tell if I’m being completely ridiculous and just crazy. But either way I’ve basically convinced myself I definitely have cancer which is stopping me from going to the doctor cause I’m too scared im right. 

For like six months I’ve been wishing I were dead and now I’m terrified that’s actually gonna happen. I want to fall in love and I haven’t really yet. I know I’m being dramatic, but I know my body and somethings really really off. I also haven’t been to a doctor in years which is also pretty intimidating.

29,"I gave my job two-weeks notice (My last day was Friday) and didn't tell anyone, and those that found out before I left got a bs excuse. I sorted out what I thought would be my final affairs. I drafted a note, I made a 'will', I gave those close to me as much of a meaningful good bye as I could without them catching on. I was going to do it yesterday, but I wanted to clean up my home a little and clean up my phone/computer of any weird stuff my family may find.

&amp;#x200B;

I tied my noose and I jammed it in the door I stood atop my squeaky black computer chair, clean and showered (for the first time in probably about a week). I must have been up there for 20 minutes trying to muster some courage. I thought about all the reasons that I wanted to kill myself. Mostly about how alone I feel all the time. How I am completely unsatisfied with my the way I look, the way I sound. I thought about how I'm a virgin at 23 years old and how I pissed away my chance at college. I took a deep breath and I edged my feet to push the chair out from under me. I had my eyes clenched shut. I took a few deep breaths and I told myself ""This is it. You'll have nothing to worry about if you just take this one step"". I couldn't do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's the fact that I've been here before. I was forced to think about the last 2 times I've tried to kill myself. The first time, when I woke up on the ground with a broken toe and a soar neck because the belt couldn't support my weight. Then the time I tried to shoot myself and the gun wouldn't fire. 

&amp;#x200B;

I made the realization that I just threw my life away and I was too much of a coward to do the one thing I've been building to the past 2 weeks and I felt defeated.  I took my noose off, and I stepped down from my chair and I just sat there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what I'm destined to do with my life. I'm a loser. I owe everyone and their mom money. I have no marketable skills, and I'm in hell. Because a part of me wants to die. It's all I think about. When I'm driving down the street I hope that   some asshole pulls out in front of me and kills me.

The first year was good but as my sophomore year goes on I don't feel motivated to go to school and I don't go to many of my classes. This wasn't my dream school as I always felt like I wanted to move away from home but moving away would mean college expenses and I don't want to fall into college debt. I live with my parents still which isn't bad but I have always felt that I could be doing more with my college experience and life if I didn't go to my current school. I don't have many friends on campus so the only friends I have are friends from my mediocre job and from high school so I don't see new people very often. 

I haven't gone to class in over a month and every time I don't go I punish/insult myself for not doing anything. I have supporting friends and family but I don't feel like I should even bother with school at this point. I don't like the school I'm going to and I have no motivation to even get up to leave my house and go outside. I just spend my time looking at videos that help distract my brain from my current predicament and every time I do this I know I only hurt myself. I don't want to kill myself (considered it in High school but wasn't strong enough) but I hurt myself by not feeding myself or by secluding myself from my friends. I am super behind all of my classes and I know theres nothing I can do at this point because I procrastinated to such an extreme. I feel guilty for not doing anything with my life when others believe in me. I just don't feel like theres a point to anything if theres no goal for me to be there.

I feel like something is wrong with me and I know its all my fault. I don't know whether I should drop out of college, go to a community college or take a gap year away. This is affecting everything and I don't know what to do about it at this point. I feel worthless and I feel guilty for not trying hard enough.

That’s HUGE!

But the people saying that the whole team should be celebrated seem completely disingenuous to me. It’s interesting that none of them have had anything to say about the “teams” until a woman was being celebrated for her achievement.

None of them gave a shit every time Elon Musk is celebrated for what his TEAMS at SpaceX and Tesla do, it’s always “Elon Musk made this” or “Elon Musk is amazing.”

1. A few years ago when I was 19, a new girl entered our group in the summer and I fell hard for her. But she liked one of my best friends( who never had a relationship before) and he fell hard for her too and they got together. One day he was out of town and through some circumstances I kissed her one night.

I felt goddamn awful afterwards, came clean to my friend and by some miracle we still are closer than ever and the girl is not in the picture anymore.

2. A few years after this, I was 22, still in town, and friends with a group of 17yo's. One of these guys looked up to me a lot, and said he viewed me as an older brother and was getting very attached to me. I wasn't feeling the same about this friendship, but whatever, we were just hanging out.

Now, he had a girlfriend who was a year older than him and I started liking her a bit. Apparently he was an asshole towards her, she wanted a way out, they broke up and I was available, so we got together, even though I knew I would absolutely crush this guy, since he admired me so much and all. 

We were together for a year, until she left for college halfway around the country,  and she left me for a guy at her new school.
Now she's friends again with her ex and I and him are on good terms again.


Now, both of these girls had big issues, but boy did I have some too. I did a lot of introspection and figured out I was a shithead and I try very hard to change myself and become a better man.

For me at least, it seems like doing a shitty thing is so much easier than doing the right thing, and is the first way to respond to this sort of situation that comes to my mind...and I don't know why.

Now I just miss a lot of things. I miss longboarding on the wide open streets of my hometown, or driving out into the middle of nowhere just to take a moment. I miss the desert where I used to visit every summer and where I hope to someday live. I miss being in love, even though I told myself I was over that. I miss all the things that used to make me feel holy, all the the things that used to make me feel whole.

I missed a class today, one that I shouldn't have missed. I narrowly avoided several panic attacks and then had one anyway. I have two important exams tomorrow, and I'm up to study for them. The only thing getting me through this week is knowing that I'm gonna get to have a chill evening with a few friends in a couple days. This cool girl I met hasn't responded since I asked her out for coffee. My life is sort of a mess and I don't know how recoverable this semester (or my GPA) really is. My parents have high expectations and think I'm doing okay, and I don't know how I'm going to face them next time I go home. I'm worried about a long-time and very close friend of mine, but I don't want to press to hard because I know what it feels like to struggle and to have people try to nose in when I'm not ready to talk.

I'm questioning every part of an identity that I thought was pretty solid - my gender, my sexuality, every little bit of my behavior, my motivations, and everything I'm interested in. I have this strong urge in the back of my head to just save up, buy a van, and disappear, but I know I can't/won't do that.

But now, at 4 in the morning, I'm having a moment of clarity. I can see right now that not everything will get better. Some things might never change and I might always struggle. But I'm kind of at peace with that. All I can do is try to find my way and try to pursue those things that make me feel whole. And one day, I'll die, and in 100 years no one will remember my name, and none of it will really matter, and that's okay. I know I won't feel this way most of the time. I know the road ahead is filled with panic attacks and late nights alone and overthinking and exhaustion and anger and sadness and heartbreak. There will be days when I'm just completely empty. And I don't know, maybe it'll just suck. I might not even feel like this in 10 minutes and I'll go back and read this and be disgusted with myself. I have no idea what will happen or where my life will go, and the best I can do is point myself somewhere and hope I land somewhere decent.

And there are things I can do now. Things I have to do now. Thank all the people to whom I literally owe my life. Apologize to the people I might have hurt. Be there for the people I care about. Remind my family that I love them. Be honest with myself. Try to write more. Do some more reflection. Make peace with some things. Pass these dumb tests. And maybe that takes me nowhere but at least I'll be trying.

Thanks and apologies to anyone who read this whole thing. This kind of thing, just getting this stuff onto a page or out into the world sometimes helps me, and I need that right now.

49,"Lately I’m not gonna lie I’ve let my ambition and goals die a little bit and for the last few months I’ve just been wallowing in my own self pity and trying to have some fun. This has led to a decrease in productivity and probability of success has decreased :( 

Basically life sucks and my goals (can’t?) be reached. First time I’ve ever felt like I couldn’t do anything. I like to say I’ll never regret anything in my life since everything is a learning experience and I wouldn’t be who I am today without those experiences! And I plan to stick with that ideology till the day I die even through the roughest of times.  I think the man question now is how to get back on track to reaching my goals I had before and removing this negative mindset I have now. 

Future—
 

I need to find out where I’m going next. I realized I need to do my traveling now so I can experience everything I want too. Italy? France? Australia? I’m literally down to go anywhere. Back to Africa?

It wouldn’t be hard to save up that much.  My job is decent and the pay kinda sucks but the benefits are pretty good not to mention the ESPP is gonna be great! I should work more to take max advantage of that. My 401k is looking good too. 

20 years old already feel like I’m turning 30 next year. Which makes me wonder what my priority is? 
Am I looking to get married by 30? 25? Not gonna lie I’ve never really had problems with girls. Especially now that I’ve been hitting the gym a lot more and been focused. I’ve been getting compliments pretty often and what not. Am I looking to screw around more than I already have? I want to say yes but feel the right answer is still no.  The emotional connection i had with someone in the past was definitely overwhelming and not sure if I could handle anything like that! It was blindness by happiness. Ignorance is bliss tho right. 

I’ve been pretty happy lately tbh even tho I haven’t done anything. Like literally anything. I’ve played more fortnite in the last couple months than I have ever before. Lol Im gross.

Baby steps are still steps. I need to remember this I have a hard time slowing down Bc I feel like I should be ahead of everyone and I usually am

I need to tame my emotional issues through meditation and mindfulness. Need a lot more self care than I thought. Considering taking a trip to India to learn more about Buddhism   

Prioritize. I haven’t done this in a while. I need to organize my priorities based on timeline and importance

I need to write more. I have my laptop and my blog which is pretty dead atm. No one knows about it so it’s pretty anonymous and I can write anything I want there. I can write my thoughts clearly.  And things to remember. 

I’ve had a decent amount of wins in the stock market with some luck and a lot of modeling and reading. Interesting enough I made my friends some money too. This finance degree may not be useless after all? But I’ve learnt shit in school and all my knowledge has come from reading and thinking. 

 If I don’t have anything I still have my gym membership. If I can’t afford gas at least I can afford to run there to do my workout. I need to remember the only thing I have for sure is my body and my mind.  

It’s 4 am and I need to sleep LOL.  Just some thoughts I’ll probably delete later.  Need s good quote of the day for today",11Apr2019,2

I dont know what to talk about with people, i cant carry a conversation for 5 minutes.

Sometimes its good at the start but i always worry about what to say maybe if i meet them the next day.

I have used most of my life talking to girls online and i just get one word replies and i give a lot of fucks about it, if i dont then they wont either and i cant make friends.

I worry so much about if they reply to me or worry what should i say... one of them even said im a boring guy.

I dont know how to make people care for me and be my friends or give me attention.

Im always the one who gives more attention than get

If i dont give a fuck i will be alone forever ever.

I dont know who i am or who i want to be or how to find out who i want to be... i dont know how to be a man or how to love my self...

I have problems with social skills, self worth, self esteem, confidence, social skills, neediness, seeking approval, and people pleasing, Not being able to make friends and having no personality, overthinking a lot, anxiety,im also a r/niceguys, not being smart, dont know where to start to improve my self.

55,"So I’m 25 and have been helping my mom get to and from doctors appointments recently. She’s usually in and out of the doctors at least once a month and has been on prescriptions for awhile (steroids, blood pressure and another one). She had a fall a few months ago and broke her collarbone, then had to go t the doctors for severe leg pain a few weeks ago as a reaction to reducing her steroid dose, then fell again recently and broke her arm pretty good. I took her to the doctor today and we were visiting with her medicine doctor and on the way out I overheard them say something about that one of her MRI’s they noticed a “‘mass” but another MRI at a separate place they didn’t notice the same mass. So on the way out when he mentioned the “mass” I turned to the doctor and said “excuse me?” And he repeated himself again and said a “mass” so I said “excuse me” again because I am not a little kid and I know what a “mass” is and he mentioned a possible tumor. My mom was very non-chalant about it as I have been helping her so much these past few months in between getting her around the house, getting dressed, helping her to the bathroom at times and seeing her cry multiple times and doing my best to just be there for her during this period. It caught me so off guard that I didn’t want to bring it up in the moment and about an hour later had to take her home and instantly called one of my brothers to talk to about it (I have 4 older brothers). As of right now I’m not sure if any of my other brothers are aware either and just really don’t know what to do or think about this situation right now. My parents split when I was younger and have both since Re-married but maintain communication and are still friendly and cordial to each other at birthdays and we all spend holidays together. I also talked to a friend about it because I needed someone to talk to but between my mom dealing with nerve damage in her neck/spine, a broken collar, broken arm, diabetes and a few other less significant issues I am just so so so so so overwhelmed with this whole situation and love my mom so much that I never want anything to happen to her.

I noticed that he made no attempt to introduce himself to me so I decided to introduce myself. He shook my hand but really didn't seem to interested. The 3 days leading up to the wedding he avoided me as much as possible and tried to cut me out of conversations when I entered the room. I think he may have been jealous as I was asked to be best man and he wasn't in the groom's party. Im usually not bothered by this sort of thing but for some reason it really bothered me and even to this day when my friend talks about him it just bothers me that he doesn't like me. Im a guy so im not really ever bothered by this type of thing but it does upset me for sure.

I decided to step out and get a different view. I hadn't put shoes on, and it felt a little cold, but it also felt so real. Something I hadn't felt for a long time.

62,"I've got two wildly different things I want to talk about, but they occupy the same head, and I don't think there's any way to really combine them. I'm going to just start writing one of them and either break off and make a new blog, or somehow discover a way they might work together. We'll see.

I'm starting to simulate what I think will happen when I get back in “it.” It, in this explanation, is that mode of being that goes hard, obsesses, believes, and exhaustively explores some avenue that's taken interest. I felt myself so confused as to what to do with myself after work today, I ended up falling asleep. I can feel my psyche shifting into needing an overwhelming topic, or shutting down from the energy zapping the circuits. Nothing else seems “right” or “appropriate,” but to progress through the things I got a taste of the other day. Clean more, build more, work more.

I think a lot about having money. I already have money, not huge amounts, but a means of acquiring it where I'm no more than a month or 2 away from being “even” or generally better off than even most first-worlders. I think about all the money I watch on talk-shows. Rich people are just like us! After a while, they just want to have game nights, and raise kids, and while they'll talk more nonchalantly about the amount and types of vacations, deeper animal desires and instincts will start to reign. “Competitive” won't be an overbearing character flaw, or a niche interest can get to work masquerading as a humanitarian exercise.

When I have money, I'll want the laughs. I'll want to keep powering through movies and shows and being fairly culturally “plugged in.” I'll want to improve on my musical knowledge. I'll want to entertain. It occurred to me that when I actually believed I could “help” something, it seemed as good a reason as any to exhaust myself in service to the mere chance I could provide. I don't know how much of my languishing belief in that is due to this 2 or so year waiting period, but the “burden” feels less imperative. I want something profitable and successful drawing off the wisdom of a thousand failures tomorrow, but I've got more of a “pace of life” attitude about it. No matter what, I'm still going to work, and I still need to refine the home base. What sense would it make to start ignoring the foundation after you've been beaten into respecting what it takes to set it up?

It's interesting me to watch the priority shift. I'll proclaim how “anti-aesthetic” I am in service to getting the job done, but I'll take my naked insulation and barn over a trailer any day. The yellowing foam insulation is keeping the bugs out, and can be trimmed any time. The mud caked onto literally everything is an immensely satisfying power-wash away from clean. While I think it'd be dumb to go into debt for the things on my Amazon wishlist, they are there for various reasons. Few hundred dollars at a time? Spend the next two weeks playing with new toys until the coffers fill back up. Consistent ongoing tune-ups and oil changes? Why, it's the responsible thing to do! Ten dollar event insurance? No sense in risking losing out.

It's feeling more and more like a craving. I can feel my chest pulling me towards my spot. I can feel myself walking lighter and smiling quicker. I'm not a person who habitually looks for a problem, and when one of the biggest ones starts to lift, it's like, now what? What do I do with my improved mood? When did I start to bother mingling? Who am I going to risk sharing what I'm doing with? It's something I cherish about drive or compulsion. You know where it's pushing you if you're willing to pay attention. I can ask every question, but I'll know I'm where I need to be when I snap into the moment and just go, “yeah.” Enough of those bred the romance I had for college friendships, so I'll be better next time, but the feeling is no-less desirable.

Let's break off and flip the script entirely. The next blog is about pee tapes.

I watched the docu-series on R. Kelly. I notice a familiar pattern in documentaries. First, there's an *obvious* “bad guy.” R. Kelly the child rapist is about as dark as you can get without drifting into an exposé on murderers. What most people can comfortably and loudly proclaim is that R. Kelly has a problem, and it's wrong to take advantage of the naivety of youth. One profession after another testifies to his controlling nature, his charisma, and his undeniable music genius that millions find compelling. The regrets are for ever having introduced someone to him, being seduced by the money or perks, or knowing full well what was wrong and how they were complicit.

I was frustrated watching the show. I couldn't escape the nagging feeling that each person professing their pain was looking for their own kind of redemption. It's almost too easy to point to the Big Problem of R. Kelly's sexual exploits. It's going to a wake or funeral knowing it's not really about the dead person, but the living's ability to process or cope. It's a memorial to reflect on what the music means to you or what kind of spell he put you under, skipping right along past what your responsibility to it might actually be. At least with the actual dead, they won't be watching to keep you honest.

That's to say, no one was offering how their experience was going to make them better. No one recalled what they “might” have done to improve upon their concerns. No one offered a proactive sentiment or where they've taken their lessons after coming out the other side. There is no real understanding of the nature of that complicitness, and instead of parsing it, in an important sense, we pick the big easy and “powerful” targets to scapegoat. I think it's the normal generalized human tendency because complicated psychological trauma is just that.

Let me be clear as well, I don't *excuse* R. Kelly for “preferring younger women.” I don't deny the power and consequences of manipulation. I know teenager brains aren't developed. I know the fucked up situations I put myself in when I was younger that I would totally have appreciated more guidance through or received leeway on. Nothing I say in this blog is supposed to be the kind of devil's advocate for exploiting children, if you're so inclined to fuck about with deliberate mis-reading.

The task is to take from specific examples, and draw out the larger ethos or implication. Isn't it weird that pee fetishes or stories seem to come from the top? Why is Trump embroiled in his own? Where do you go when you have everything besides return to a kind of filth? You'd probably reflexively say you could just enjoy and vibe with the good you have and the opportunities presented, but then I think you're living in the kind of fantasy world where our minds don't attack us when we're happy, or pick our most secure periods to feel anxious.

I couldn't help but hear faint echoes of the dialogue surrounding me and the party dynamics in college. I've not been accused of pedophilia, but I have been of rape. How did that conversation go? Well, it mostly didn't, but my power was brought up. The implicit guilt I should feel *because I knew what I was doing*. What for years might've been written off as a kind of alcoholic and immature culture immediately became *my problematic behavior*. And certainly, let's not forget that we're supposed to, without examination or doubt, *believe all women* regardless, because it's time to wildly swing the culture war in the other direction, civilian casualties a mere rounding error.

I don't think I've ever denied my awareness of my power. I wouldn't be foolish enough to think the sway of fame and fortune wouldn't capture nearly everyone. But I always return to the moment. It's in the moment you discover what your responsibility is. It's in the moment you seize power. It doesn't help the conversation or the capacity to take on more responsibility when “problems” remain as distinctly abstract as a series of damnations all alluding to horrible feelings. It's not enough.

They say it starts small. First he made girls who were susceptible to him call him “daddy.” Then he'd control who they could talk to. Then he'd keep them in his house. He'd beat and degrade. Every day, every hour, and every minute of that process was a moment. Each of those moments absolved and absorbed by fear and every complicated psychological description of the consequences of fear. Here maybe we start to begin picking at what “our” cultural responsibility is to young girls, or young black girls, or youth. What we may or may not find entertaining I think is mute before you have that discussion.

What is R. Kelly afraid of? Consequences? Eh, maybe, but he pretty reflexively pisses in the face of the idea of those, and then proceeds to make a million dollars in doing so. What am I afraid of? It's certainly not bringing up rape accusations and comparing myself to R. Kelly. I want to have the conversation about what we're going to bring into the moment moving forward. I want to discuss the ardent feelings and insistence I believe is earnestly felt if misplaced. I could spend hours dancing around political ways to explain myself or write off the situation in a series of crass doubled-down horrible jokes (or do both), but neither would speak to the conversation I have with myself regarding my behavior. R. Kelly has fans who “believe” in him. How should we regard that belief? To the degree it's a blind fervent love, little to none. I can apparently party and have sex with a fair amount of people, be excessively open about it, and still have my motives regarded as predatory and forceful, to me, as ardently believed by any fan of popular hashtag-moments might. So then what's my responsibility?

Notably, when you do something criminal, the suggestion is that you go to jail. We, of course, don't live in a world where punishments ever remotely match crimes, and usually the accused's most ferocious defenders have more than one skeleton that resembles what's on trial. I don't think it wise to serve unjust sentences, nor do I think a lack of conviction erases implications. My method is to keep talking and keep asking. I likely won't be conducting myself with the same age-group of drunk crowds the rest of my life. Do you apologize? I was told it would be the height of a bad idea to reach out. And then I'm apologizing for hurting her, or for a rape I don't believe I committed? Moreover, I do believe, easily, that I tore her vagina and probably missed a cue to slow down or when to start back up. I've managed to accidentally make girls bleed with us perfectly sober, let alone drunk enough to think a quickie on the side of a house party was tactful.

That “compulsion” or “force” that points you at what needs to be dealt with is playing out with #metoo and Black Lives Matter, and the general consequences of concentrated wealth and power. That's the underlying conversation and psychological battlefield. Knowing what you know now, what happens if you have a daughter who'd ever be willing to call someone daddy? Knowing what you know now, how often should you use alcohol for anything beyond a polite buzz or to share in a sense of camaraderie? How easy is it to rail against the likes of R. Kelly or reel at the idea of getting pissed on, verses the Olympic task of addressing child brides more broadly, or our complicated biology and aberrant sexual preferences?

What if we took a step even further? What if we discovered in ourselves the filth and the worst thoughts? What if we couldn't pass the depravity onto someone else's example and had to take responsibility to act in spite of it? What if we had to remind ourselves every day, “But for the grace of God go I?” What if you're always going to love *I Believe I Can Fly* no matter how many 14 year olds you watch R. Kelly pee on or have sex with? What if you never allow yourself to forgive what your under-developed brain considered a good idea and “always/never” your understanding of yourself and past into a depression spiral? When do you recognize and take the moment for all that it is, and not just the single feeling or person you can point to and judge?

I'm in a job where, to be effective you're forced to, at the very least, pretend that everything is okay. Interestingly enough, for me, in an important sense, it is. I can calmly ask you about accusations that you sexually molested your child. I'm not there with an agenda to catch you. If I can I certainly will and will nail your ass to the wall, but it's a story first. There are significantly more examples of spiteful ex-spouses, resentful sister-in-laws, and crotchety grandma's calling us with crazy stories than there are violent drug-addled child molesters looking to hurt everyone around them and tear things down. There are a lot of problems out there, and there's an infinite sea of grey that no institution, nor really any individual than the person suffering, can do much about. The story of either of our responsibility to their situation is the eternal cultural question.

Are there easy takeaways? Don't be complicit might be one. I'm not going to ignore a hypodermic needle I see in your house or pretend it's cleaner than it is. I'm not going to attempt to unduly punish you or speak as harshly of you as you attempt to provoke me to. I know you're broken. I know you can't pronounce “denial” before you get around to discussing what it is you're denying. I know that method works insofar as you're not the one rehashing dramatic instances in your life from slightly modified angles over years. I know it's hard to accept that achieving a remote peace of mind is even possible. I know you'll feel guilty of something regardless.

That's how I read people. I get bored to tears hearing the same catch-phrases and cultural virtue signaling. You can state what you blame on someone and follow it up with your course of action or responsibility. You can build within yourself, and future relationships, the bullwork for combating what you see wrong with how power manifests or the indignity and intransigence of those you wish to see take more responsibility. But you can tell most of the story in how they respond. Do they want more or less? Do they entertain or dismiss? Do they cry and shut down, or spit and choke out as close to an approximation of what they're feeling and thinking in spite of themselves?

::breathe::

But let's bring it over to “forgiveness.” I feel like forgiveness is a pat-on-your-back sort of thing. They say you'll never really process or move on until you forgive. But if things are all coming from you. If it's about how you morph reality and how you understand it or can cope, then ultimately you're forgiving yourself. No matter what somebody has done, you have to forgive yourself your anger, forgive yourself your angst, forgive yourself the depression and the pain and the lashing out or whatever the fuck else.

And then that becomes a double-edge sword, because your capacity to forgive yourself can develop the kind of pathologies that protect a lot of shitty behavior, or give others the tools to understand you in a “forgiving framework,” even when some shit doesn't deserve to be forgiven. Remember, it's God that forgives all sins. So how convenient little god-complexes present a holier-than-thou posture about their hypocrisy and hatred. It becomes forgiven when they give up thinking about it or were too dumb or afraid to process the devil at the wheel.

I don't like a great deal of things that have been implicated about me and my life. I don't like that I had to pay a ticket for passing a school bus I did not intend, nor really believe, I actually passed turning. I don't feel like a proud “bad boy” for being overtly sexual and finding myself on some proverbial opposite side of the ring regarding the progression of women's rights or the severity of men's shitty behavior towards them. I don't beg for the pain and drama nor try to deny when it's a palpable force in how someone's life feels like it's being conducted. I don't want to be ignored for my railings against too-good “problems” and the weather to then dare believe we should be dismissing the complicated psychology or circumstances of teenagers who are stardom-adjacent or 20-somethings and party hook-ups. You have to be willing to accept it and work with it all. Not accept things as “perfectly right” or “correct” or “inevitable,” but accept there's layers that work to depersonalize and reassign the nature of how we're going to relate to each other.

You have to remain responsible to the moment, not what you presume to believe yourself capable of in the future. You have to examine the past, because it's manifest in what you're feeling and how you're behaving right now. I'm not begging to be around people who prefer to think of me as a rapist. I don't feel guilty when a catchy song comes on from someone *we all know about*. If you do, turn it off. And if you feel bad and don't, unpack what “complicity” means to you. Put little weights on the scales about how good, or nothing, you feel against the idea of kids getting peed on. Or don't, and keep skipping from monster to monster to blame. I think at some level we know we deserve what that strategy is giving us.",11Apr2019,1

I’m 25 and my twenties so far has been a rollercoaster of anxiety and emotions. It’s been a period of realizing why I am the way I am, and being angry in hindsight. I also realized how clueless my parents actually are, and that I’m most likely going to end up working some passionless career for the rest of my life.

70,"I got to work this morning to my job of eight years and just felt like I didn't belong. It's my family's business and, yet, I get treated like I just started. I'm not asking for nepotism, just fairness. I've made ten percent above minimum wage for six years and work, if I'm lucky, thirty hours a week. I've complained about my work on Reddit before but at this point I'm just kinda indifferent. I like my habits and my routines and I value loyalty, which is why I haven't made a move to a better job. I've worked in the business since I was old enough to lift fifty pounds, which was probably ten or eleven, but now I'm twenty-three and I'm just burnt out. I have no incentive to put my best in and give my all. I love my co-workers and our customers but upper management, which includes my dad, makes me feel like shit. Over the past three years my responsibility has increased several fold and my pay hasn't. There's no privacy here either, so bringing up issues of my recompense has to be done off hours or in earshot of my co-workers; neither of which are even close to ideal. I love writing and I'm good at it, but I'm not sure if I'm good enough to be published and make a career out of it. I've considered working for the shipyard in my state that builds submarines, but it's far from my home and I'd have over an hour commute every day on a vehicle that isn't super reliable, plus I'd need to be trained and I'm historically bad at getting out of my comfort zone. Overall I feel trapped and undervalued and stagnated and nothing seems to go right for me when I try to change so why should I bother anyway?

74,"I recently got hired at a company that claims it’s very “family-like” where everyone looks out for each other. 

There are groups of people who go out and drink often and I got invited to go out as well. These groups often include managers, supervisors, HR reps...an interesting mix of people. Anyway, my boss invited me out for a drink with a bunch of them so I agreed. 

Now, there is a coworker who travels and is rarely in the office who basically has told me he likes me but understands I have a boyfriend, but he’s cool with being friends and is there if I ever need something. I only really started talking to him a week or so prior. , but everyone in the office has such high regards for him. He was there and this is who this story is really about. 

So we all went out, we were drinking talking about ourselves, super casual, when someone asked about me and my family. I gave them a very basic answer but they wanted to dive deeper so I started talking about my younger brother who has special needs. 

Now I should preface that my family is a peculiar case. My parents were alcoholics/ drug addicts, mental illness was/is rampant in my family. My little brother is currently diagnosed with “pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified,” the doctors basically said “hey something is wrong with him but we don’t specifically know what.”  As a child he was diagnosed with autism, and then mental retardation. 

And that kid has come a damn far way. ❤️ He was practically nonverbal as a child and had explosive anger issues. After our mother died and then our father was arrested with 16 DUIs and 3 felonies we were taken in by a family member. She got my brother into many different therapies including social skills, speech therapy, group therapy, the works. Now he lives in a special needs assisted living community (in his own apartment!), has a job at a grocery store bagging and collecting carts, has a girl friend (also special needs), and he was in the special olympics. 
I’m pretty protective of him, we’ve been through some fucking shit and we made it. But, I’m not always there for him like I would like to be and I really should be spending more time with him and taking him out. 

ANYWAY, they were asking about him and I told them how he’s been a little lonely since he graduated high school where he saw his friends everyday, and there were planned activities/events. He has also regressed in terms of social skills and language due to the fact that he isn’t in school anymore and he is interacting mostly with other individuals who struggle with communication skills. I think this has been a quite an issue for him as he has expressed frustration due to difficulties in communicating how he’s feeling. 

Well THE GUY, was saying how he would LOVE to hang out with my brother, take him to baseball games, the rec center, just play video games, whatever. I didn’t believe him at first but he insisted that he would love to help. I honestly started to cry a little bit. It isn’t often that someone outside of my family offers to do something so kind for my little bro. 

Well fast forward a few days and he brought it up again. I wasn’t going to bring it up because I just assumed he was trying to be nice and he was drunk at the time of offering. Again a little overwhelmed with emotions we started talking about it and what they would do together. He then told me that him hanging out with my little brother was contingent on me basically breaking up with my boyfriend of 6 years and dating him... oh and he would have to leave him new wife that he isn’t happy with.  

Excuse me, but what the fuck? No! I was very clear that I had a long time boyfriend, and that the guy was nice and all but It’s just not going to work right now, AND HE WAS COOL WITH IT. He then started saying how if my boyfriend was really “my man” that my bf would hang out with my brother (and yes we do). Why the fuck would you offer this to someone after discussing that and then saying it was contingent on dating when I told them it wasn’t going to happen??

Omg sorry everyone but I just can’t get over that. Go back to your wife that you are trying to cheat on and stay away from me AND my brother. 


TL/DR: I was telling my coworker about my special needs brother and how I don’t hang with him as much as I should and he offered to be his friend/ mentor. Turns out he was trying to get in my pants and the offer to be my brothers friend was contingent on that...",11Apr2019,632

80,"I don't have enough faith to believe that I will be saved even though everyone says that I am through the Word.

Sometime during college, I heard a voice say to me as I gazed to my passenger seat next to me wishing I had a significant other to look back at me, ""you don't know I'm staring straight into your eyes wishing I was human."" Later on I would find out that Archangel Michael was the one sitting in te passenger seat.

I asked for God to show up as a burning bush to see if He was real. He manifested as a burning bush on the side of a campus building to prove to my 22 year old self. The bad thing was I did not talk to him and left. He said to other students who wanted to ask questions about heaven that He came specifically for me. My hard heartedness lent Him to say He would let me serve corpses for eternity if I continued to walk away.

I first asked for Archangel Michael to show up in 2013 to see if he was real. When he first showed up looking at me with soft eyes, I knew I had already done something wrong. It turned out he saw me being punished according to the religion I was exposed to and wanted to save me from that pain. He pointed out that I figured out he wasn't human and that I requested that angels show up in a public place so I wouldn't be scared off.

I tried looking for his wings and his immediate response was, ""I don't have to show you my wings. You judge people by their looks.""

I thought about asking him the meaning of life but he just said, ""You're so busy thinking of asking me what the meaning of life is to listen to what I have to say.""

I looked up at him and he replied, ""You have to move on.""

The archangel instantly responded to my intents and telepathically responded, ""You're thinking of proposing to me.""

I suddenly thought, ""Will you be my boyfriend?""

He was suddenly taken aback and tried to hold back his feelings.

It didn't faze me. I still asked him, ""Can I have a hug?""

""If you want a hug, you have to come to me."" He answered.

Unfortunately I didn't go up to him for one.

He said, ""I can't wait forever."" I let too much time pass and he gave me an angry look and followed with, ""Well, I've told you what God told me to tell you."" and left.

A few days later, I was lying in bed and called to him in my heart out of loneliness. I felt his invisible presence suddenly lying next to me in bed. He said, ""You don't know I'm lying next to you staring straight into your eyes. You don't know angels can't have relationships.""

He suddenly changed locations to stand at my bedside. ""Now I'm at your bedside,"" he said. I looked at the left corner of my bed near the desk.

Archangel Michael replied, ""that's the wrong side. You're looking at the wrong side because you can't see me.""

At that point I gave up trying and went to the dresser right across from my bed to look for clothing.

""Oh, you care more about your clothes than me. Well, I'm leaving you now."" he responded as he walked out of the doorway.

One day when I passed three boys at church and showed some interest, my granduncle said I had to talk to them if I liked them. As I refused and began to walk away, Archangel Michael tripped me so I would stop. I raised my arms on each side to regain balance and turned around to give them a minute or two of gladness out of instant karma. Due to pride, I didn't bother going back to talk to them.

When I moved back to my parents' house, I began to sin instead of be productive so the archangel began to let me hear his presence walking around my room. He used that method to get me up out of bed and dress for the day. Archangel Michael never allowed me to hug him for the next three years, but knew he had to try saving me from my sin. Though he kept his distance, I felt his care for me. He would respond to my intent for him to stay with ""I can stay for you, I have to go, I'm busy."" When my sin began to overtake me he stomped his foot loudly to warn me of his anger. I sent him an image of me wearing a long sleeve, v-neck black dress with white wings behind my back while being led by his right hand and looking into his eyes. I would later find out it made him want to find a black dress for me.

I dreamt of kissing my guardian angel once after hearing someone else was able to do so. Two archangels stood in front of me in a reddish realm of a room discussing some man's future life plan. The archangel on the right finally noticed me and gave me an angry look and said I wasn't supposed to be here. The one on the left glanced at me then asked why I was there. The other one who was angry replied that I was there because I heard some other woman say she kissed her guardian angel on the cheek. When I turned to the right back a few feet away I saw a line of archangels standing there waiting to be called to duty. The one closest to me immediately rushed over with enthusiasm and bent down. He nodded eagerly and I heard the words, ""yes, you may kiss me"" and offered his cheek. When I kissed him, I felt the bliss spread from my lips to my whole being and I awoke from being so happy.

There came a point where he could not stand watching me sin any longer and refused to let me hear his presence for several months. During that time I ended up with PTSD from an incident at home. It was only weeks later he would walk around my room at night to let me know he was still there watching me, but I thought it was someone else.

When he finally returned to start a relationship at night, he could tell my love had faded when I chose to belive my own stubbornness over his words and from then on he knew our relationship was coming to an end. I broke up with him forgetting how much his presence was worth and became so lonely to the point I turned to Taoism to wish for a husband. I honestly believed, as Archangel Michael said, that the Taoist gods would bring me a husband. I ended up naming the archangel despite being warned by Mazu/Matsu that I would end up serving corpses. I named him anyway and he invisibly turned up behind me to tell me he knew for a fact I would not endure the pain it would require and would marry the world instead. I could tell there was somethingwrong when I heardhim say that, but I trusted and believed him so I made that wish. He watched me give into vanity listing those not meant for me regardless of their potential feelings and to find a job through marriage because I thought I could work in the same field as my spouse.

I saw the results of this wish in May of 2018. I saw living and deceased partners brought to me at a metro station in Taipei. For some reason I only thought of two holy figures to save me, and that was God and Archangel Michael. Alas, I turned away from both God and Archangel Michael, either of whom were willing to give me that marriage I always wished for. It would have changed the bible, as would marriage to any other holy figure in any holy text.

Archangel Michael detailed what would happen for the options of yes and no. If I agreed, I would cross over in his arms, the spell cast over him desiring me would wear off, he would break us free using his wings. His proposal was, ""I can't wait to hear you scream have mercy and carry you up to a better place where you will no longer hurt anyone."" I would stay in the room he prepared for us for him to visit during personal time off between work. If I declined, I would suffer the result of marrying the world in the afterlife, serving corpses for eternity. Regrettably, I was too afraid of dying screaming in pain, only to find out my death in the future from rejecting marriage to him was just as excruciating as well as horrible and gross with eternal suffering in horror as the consequence.

I later found out that God and Jesus read the letters asking for forgiveness that I burned to them about the relationship and God was originally going to make Archangel Michael save me for having a relationship with me but the fact I threw my life away last week negated all of that it seems. It wasn't meant to be. I have yet to gain his forgiveness for breaking his heart.  It could be that I just need to accept my fate now despite what good I do in the future - nothing will be considered enough, even if it happens to be saving the world.",11Apr2019,1

103,"Hi all, I just want to start by saying: I myself am not a flat earther, I respect peoples believes and standpoints as long as it doesn't physically hurt others.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR (at the top because I recently read that people prefer this): Father is Flat-earther, I learnt to respect it and other standpoints unless they actually cost lives or hurt others. A little Anti-vaxx rant and why it is way worse than Flat-earth.

&amp;#x200B;

So this all started about 1,5-2 years ago, my father was a HUGE space fan. He loved everything about space and just how immense and beautiful it is.

Just one day, he became a flat earther. He started discussions on flat earth on birthday parties, at the dinner table and whenever he kind of could. It was a bit annoying, he would play videos of flat earth on the television while we where having dinner so we couldn't try to avoid it.

He was trying to indoctrinate us, I started pressing him on that and he then noticed it and stopped doing that.

Later on he would start heated discussions on facebook groups about space, he would often get permabanned and get really mad about it. He would say things along the lines of ""I thought we had freedom of speech"" and ""Some people are just afraid of what they don't want to believe"".

&amp;#x200B;

I know how the internet thinks about ""flattards"", I know what flat-earthers think of ""globarts"". I don't really care, everyone is just a person.

You can easily think of a random stranger online the worst things, just don't forget that if a person close to you would have the same standpoint, you'd have to accept and respect it at the very LEAST.

If you erase someone out of your life because they have a standpoint that you don't like, then you should be VERY ashamed of yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

How did I deal with it? I looked at it myself so I at least had a basic understanding of what the flat earth theory is all about. I will not judge anything until I have looked at it myself and have a basic understanding of it.

To be fair, yes the Flat-earth theory has some points that I disagree with and the science it uses can be very warped or very wrong at times, but it is not a complete mess like Anti-vaxx.

&amp;#x200B;

Anti-vaxx and flat-earth are COMPLETELY different in my eyes: Flat-earth has not killed or hurt, Anti-vaxx has killed and is hurting people.

Believe me, the Flat-earth community also sees the Anti-vaxx as enemies. Flat-earth does not make Polio, Whooping cough or Measles return, Anti-vaxx does.

I have in fact looked at the ideas and theories of the Anti-vaxx, it's illogical, dangerous, blind and just plain idiotic. It is BASIC Human Biology we are talking about, the Immune system, everybody has had this in school!

&amp;#x200B;

So, let's try to erase the REAL dangers out of this world and at least ignore the ideas we don't agree with.

Thank you for reading my little rant/standpoint, bless you and have a good night!",11Apr2019,4

I've never liked receiving gifts. They're this perfect storm of unwanted attention, responsibility, and judgement. People telling you who they think you are, in the form of an object. It does nothing but feed dysphoria and make you feel emptier than you already do.

109,"I'm 18, live with my parents, and one thing I can not and have never stood for is double standards and this has particullarly made a bit of a clash between me and my parents over the years as they seem to try and pull one over my and abuse it whenever they can. I don't really know what to do in situations like this. ""Apologise"" - when I don't mean it just to keep things friendly, or hold my ground when I genuinley haven't done anything wrong and create tension, or even an argument like just now with my mum.  

&amp;#x200B;

For starters me and my mum get along very well but she still seems to try to pull this one whenever she gets the chance. In the past I have recorded potential situations like this on my phone to listen to afterwards and reflect on whether or not I was in the wrong, or if I did/said/sounded wrong. This has reassured me that I haven't. So I was intending in borrowing something from my mum for a few hours, and she questioned something I intended to do with it. I was a little confused as I thought it seemed quite obvious ( due to a feature she has used in the past ) but I questioned a few different things and asked her what she meant. We went back and forwards a few times and then I questioned if she knew about said feature and she claims she didn't. She instead says ""You could have just said that instead of being a cocky obnoxious arrogant little shit..."" in a pretty serious sounding tone, raising her voice, which caught be off guard.  I immediatley jumped a little on the defensive and raised my voice too, to match hers and stated that I in no way intended to sound like that and it was just a misunderstanding but she starts talking over me and gets angry a starts to waffle on about how cocky and arrogant I am thinking I can get away with talking to her like that and how she wont stand for it and being as I cant respect her she wont allow me to use what I was going to borrow until I apologise for treating her like shit. I refused to outright. She questioned why and I said I'm not going to apologise for treating her with the same respect she treated me unless she was willing to aswell. She gets a little aggressive and says how I was being a disrespectful shit and how I don't deserve to use her belongings to which I said I apologise for the mis-understanding which caused that argument but I'm just not going to apologise for ""Treating her like shit"" because I didn't. She tells me to fuck off back to my room because I was disturbing her and it was left at that.  

&amp;#x200B;

My dad does this alot with everyone. He raises his voice and shouts and bellows at people and if they ever drop their levels of respect to his standards, he goes ballistic. I feel this is where my mum has gotten it from a little and I just refuse to apologise for situations like that without mutual apologies. Am I doing wrong in this? Like I said I'm not one for double standards and absolutely detest the idea that someone can treat someone else with such a difference in respect and \*get away with it\*. Maybe I'm overreacting to this but I just know now - and this makes me feel a little upset - that my mum is thinking that I'm disrespectful and arrogant and how I was just looking for an argument when I genuinley intended for nothing of the sort. I apologised for that like I said I get ""Just fuck off"" as a response.",11Apr2019,1

113,"// Not sure if this is the right subreddit to post, but for some reason there is no subreddit to neutrally discuss subreddits. Hope it's cool...

Anyway, I found these two

/r/MapTheory 

/r/DeeCiphers

The first is apparently about math, and the second is about some ciphers from literature over the past 500 years, relating to world domination and what not. The frequency of the posts is... interesting.

Dee Ciphers are apparently named after this guy who, according to the subreddit, influenced shakespeare to include them in his plays https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee

Anyway I spent like 2 hours delving myself into this and my friends just called it batshit crazy stuff, but I would like to hear some other serious opinions.

115,"I was going to be 8 weeks pregnant tomorrow. But this morning I started having hurtfull  cramps in my stomach, so my partner and I called the doctor. He said we should get an echo asap to know what was going on. We kinda thought it was just my intestines....

So at 6pm we went to a gynaegologist who could see us today. She did the echo and... saw nothing. No embryo was growing in my uterus... she said it would probably be growing in one of my ovaries so she had to perform surgery on me to take that away. Apparantly this could have been deadly for me if I kept carrying the chlld as my ovary would rip open and I would bleed on the inside of my body. 
The surgery happened immediately after our appointment. 
Since I was already almost 8 weeks far she had to take the ovary away at my right side, where our baby was growing... 
I am grieving over this right now... And I am so scared this will happen again next time I get pregnant...  IF we ever succeed to conceive again. We want to have children so badly and god would my partner be such a fantastic father...",11Apr2019,49
116,"So hi, I’m an introvert teenager and I stay awake at night thinking, making up brilliant plans for days out with friends, I wake up in the morning and I don’t want to do my excellent plan with anyone.

My male friends are weird, like, weird weird. I feel like I’m the only normal one out of my friend group. But my female friends are nice and kind, but I’m scared that I won’t be able to hold the conversation. I’m scared that things will be awkward and we’ll have nothing to say. 

I really wanna go to this shopping centre with someone but I would rather go on my own, my mum is against that and my dad is like “take one of the lads with you” but I just don’t want to. So I’m sitting here wasting my school holidays.

121,"Every night I can remember I have a nightmare or night terror that's all too realistic. Last night I dreamt I got expelled from my university for grades being too low, but instead of getting yelled at by my dad he gave me a pep-talk and told me to keep my chin high. My friends came back and wanted to be with me. 

Then I woke up. Normally I wake up 10 minutes before my class (10 AM, class is 15 minutes away and it takes me ~20 minutes to get ready), covered in sweat, groggy, or generally uncomfortable, but today I woke up at 5 AM and felt... awake. It was strange considering my dream about failing the only thing that I cared about, but I woke up with no anxiety.

I even got to class on time, participated in lectures and stayed awake the entire day. No moments of falling asleep or tears. For the first time in 4 months I felt happy.",11Apr2019,3
122,Some people stand on their soapbox and preach their gospel. Then you point out their hypocrisy and all of a sudden you're the one in the wrong.

123,"I feel like this happens often to me where I’ll be talking to someone and they’ll be talking about somebody else they dislike but it sounds like they’re talking about me. I’m not sure if it’s in my head, I understand people are sometimes passive aggressive and veil their insults, but I’ve never heard of anyone talk about insulting someone this way. I’ve been bullied a lot, so I’m sort of predisposed to think people are being dicks, but sometimes it’s so obvious I can’t help it. And it happens to me all the time. I can’t think of a single person who hasn’t done this to me at some point or another.

For instance, my ex girlfriend was talking about a guy she dated when we were still together a few weeks ago and was talking about how boring he was, how he just sat there and listen to her talk, how he had no redeeming qualities but was loyal, how he was quiet and couldn’t seem to break into conversation, etc. This sounds exactly like me. I asked her in passing if she thought l was boring at all and she was like “no of course not” and a few moments later she was like “ya I guess boring people are insecure about how boring they are. I was complaining to [the guy] about it and then he was like ‘am I boring’”

Like, she was obviously talking about me right? I just don’t understand why someone would be passive aggressive like that.",11Apr2019,3
124,"So first and foremost i (25f) have to start with the fact i know its myself that i do it too, i put waaay to much pressure on myself, can over think things/look into things too far and can be quite defensive, however i can recognise when ive gone over the line of rational thinking (aha)

However at the moment my job is stressing me theeee fuck out, women shitting on others for the sake of a little power trip ect, general bitchiness and i cant hack it, im constantly anxious at work, its a very demanding job and on the occasion i forget something, thats it, its picked up on in two seconds flat and reprimanded. I feel like the buzzards are circling everyday! I dont get support from my manager so have stopped bringing things up with her as it just gets ‘rationalised and reduced’ 

Theres one woman in particular that I absolutely cannot tolerate at the moment, now she is acutely good at her job which is a more authoritative role (official or not, nobody including the boss and manager will argue) but my lord does she know it, lords it over everyone and loves every sickening part of it, walks around like shes the cut above, and i cant stand it, to the point im starting to ignore her criticisms (childish i know but after a year my fucks to give have run dry) 

My issue is nobody else seems to be bothered by it, which makes me doubt myself, and why cant i just let it go..? 

Im so miserable there and resent most of the team..?

129,"So the last year and a half have been the worst, longest two years of my life. These last two weeks specifically. I fucked up my relationship with my best and only friend cause I got drunk and made a move on him, which was actually the first of many things that have happened over the last two weeks that make them stand out amongst all the other shitty weeks of the last two years. We're still talking and he says he's gotten over it but things just aren't the same. I have exams in 50 days that I am quite literally, in no way whatsoever, ready for. As I type this it's 00:23 in the morning, and I have yet to start an entire portfolio due for tomorrow that's worth 25% of my overall grade. I'm going to fail my exams, not get into college and be stuck in my parents' house for the next decade. I feel so lonely all the time. No matter how much sleep I get I'm always tired. I'm constantly bored and the things that used to entertain me just aren't working anymore. The last two years have killed any passion I have for literally anything. I now dread the idea of having to do things I previously loved doing. Nothing gives me pleasure anymore, not even masturbation or sex. At this point, I masturbate because I feel like I should, not because it actually brings me any pleasure. Most of the time I end up in a ball on my bed afterwards purely due to the fact that this thing that's supposed to be enjoyable just no longer is, at all. I have a therapist and as nice as she is, she isn't helping, and I don't feel comfortable enough around her to share my innermost thoughts. My family aren't the type that you have very deep conversations with. The one teacher in school that genuinely wants to help me has announced our class with him tomorrow will be the last we'll have with him, as he is being replaced with another teacher who doesn't know me at all. The counsellors in school are useless, it's obvious they don't care at all about us and they're just doing the bare minimum so they can get paid. I hate the country I live in, it's always dreary, dark and depressing. I just... I'm not thinking of hurting myself or anything but I just don't see a reason at all for what it is that we do. And where I am right now, while I wouldn't take my own life, if a bus or truck were to hit and kill me, I don't think I'd care. Why should I keep powering through this horrible life? For vague promises of a better future from older people whose lives look just as horrible as mine? I just don't get it...",11Apr2019,6

Lots of people out there, alone together. Lots of people out there, having fun, not sparing a thought to the less lucky.
