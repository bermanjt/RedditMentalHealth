0,"My therapist of three years and I had our last session today. She’s moving across the state. I have another therapist lined up but I’ve been dreading this day since she told me she was moving a month ago. I started seeing her when I moved up here for grad school and continued seeing her after I got a job in the same town. We’ve been working through my PTSD and she’s been helping me become more comfortable with being vulnerable. She’s been the best therapist I’ve ever had and has helped me realize things about myself and she helped me process through some difficult emotions regarding my brothers death. If you have a good therapist, you should thank them the next time you see them. ",28Mar2019,2
1,"This is kinda hard to explain but I feel so abnormal.

I also don’t think this is common, because it seems to stupid to be.

Since the last few days I have been very startled by common sounds. For instance, if I’m reading something, or just generally focused on something, even like the sound of me taking a deep breath catches me off guard, almost as if it sounds differently and isn’t coming from me. But once I focus on the sound I realize “oh, that was just me breathing”

It legit has me worried although it’s nothing more then just annoying

Has anyone ever experienced this and will it go away?",28Mar2019,2
2,"Man this is a heavy one for me and I'm not sure if this is the right place to post, but I just need to put it out there and get some perspective on this. Basically, I've always thought my unit to be normal, albeit slightly unusual. However, I must have been in a weird headspace yesterday because I was just staring at my dick and thinking, almost as if for the first time, ""I wonder if it is actually normal that I'm uncircumcised yet don't have enough foreskin to wrap around and cover the tip."" So I googled, and learned that I was born with a condition known as hypospadias. Not only is my foreskin different, but I also learned that the opening of my urethra is not where it should be, but instead is on the underside of the tip, which I always thought was normal (you really don't take notice of this kind of thing or even this region when watching porn). I guess this is technically a malformation as the urinary channel never fully developed to reach the tip of my penis while I was in the womb. I also have a small cleft on the tip where the urinary opening should be that connects to the actual opening below it, like a faux dick hole. On the bright side, it could be worse. Some people with hypospadias have the opening of their urethra lower down the shaft, and some even as far back as the taint. I guess its also common for people to have a smaller than usual penis size with hypospadias, which is luckily not my situation as I am at least slightly above average in length.

Learning this has really fucked me up. Being almost 30, this sudden, giant revelation that my hardware is malformed hit me like a brick wall. On the one hand I'm angry to find out I have had this congenital disorder and have been different than other people this entire time, although I guess I have always felt different than others in a subconscious way. I asked my mom earlier today if I had been diagnosed with a congenital defect, and she was confused. When I said the name of it, she brushed it off like ""oh yeah! the pediatric urologist told us after you were born and said it's fine."" Like what the fuck? Some people even consider this to be an intersex condition, as the genitalia had technically never fully developed. I am confused as to why she and my father didn't think that something like this might emotionally or psychologically affect me later in life, or at least think to tell me at some point as learning this now has left me with incredibly confused and panicked feeling. I'm confused as to why the pediatric urologist didn't elect for a cosmetic surgery at the time so that my junk wouldn't look this much different than most other dudes. Just this newly discovered term, HYPOSPADIAS, is flashing in my head with this realization that I have a malformed cock. I have had sexual partners in the past that haven't noticed or at least haven't said anything about it, including one long term relationship. I haven't been sexually involved with anyone in a while due to general depression, however learning this does encourage me to meet girls anytime soon.",28Mar2019,3
3,"I don’t know how to describe it. 

A few examples would be:

Meeting my boyfriend 2 years ago. Hanging out for the first time as friends to not see each other for another year. I have a hard time wrapping my head around that person being the same person I’m seeing now. He feels very foreign to me even though he is the closest in my life. 

I am thinking of a few months ago. I was driving back from California to Georgia by myself. This memory feels very weird, I have no idea how to describe it. I did it, I know I did it, but for some reason this memory feels very foreign, like it doesn’t belong to me. 

Everything feels empty and like I am floating through life. ",28Mar2019,2
4,I started an anti anxiety/depressant a week and a half ago but I think I'm feeling worse than before. I came home after work and just layed in bed and drank some beer. Did not want to get out of bed. I haven't showered in 3 days and it's hard to even want to. I know I have to but I just don't want to. And I don't wanna get out of bed in the morning. The last couple days I've been waiting till the last min to get up for work. ,28Mar2019,1
5,"I don't know what caused it. I'm 23 and have Adhd, OCD, and bipolar.

I need to note I'm on Adderall for the Adhd and a friend gave me an energy drink. Seemed like a bad idea, but I didn't think about it until now.

So, I tagged along with my mom today to keep her company since she had to do a lot of work and I felt fine all day. On the way back we were driving down a road and I was looking at the shadows and thought of a gif where one of the shadows was a hole in the road. It was a passive nothing thought, but as we got close to the shadow I was looking at I went in full massive panic attack mode. My head went really light, I couldn't breath barely speak, needed to pull over. I thought I was literally about to die. I tried to calm myself down but it didn't work until I sat up quickly. I was then clear again instantly. I was calm and able to think. 

It's been 4 hours since and I've done nothing since I got home but think about it and that whatever the fuck just happened could happen again.

I'm really not trying to ask for medical advice, but I'm a hypochondriac, it felt like thinking about that episode was going to cause more and I was going to go insane.",28Mar2019,1

8,"As in: you play as an individual, and do not need other individuals to play (so, like, tennis is out even though it can be an individual sport).

10,"I managed to do it because after all these years he hadn't proposed. I know that sounds dumb, but it's what I fixated on. It's what got me out. Six years and there was still no sign of a ring. 

But it was more than that. I need a partner. Someone who is there for me. I supported us financially while he was out of work, while he blew his savings on weed. I smoke too, I'm not making some dig at weed. I enjoy it. But I was smoking because he was. I ended up taking care of him constantly because he was too stoned to do anything. I became his housekeeper. He'd be stoned on the couch while I was on a cleaning spree. He'd be too stoned to do anything so I'd make us dinner and do the dishes afterwards. I do all of the household chores. All of them, other than his laundry. I cooked, I cleaned, I set his doctor appointments. 

I'm bipolar with an anxiety disorder. I also have other health issues. I've gone off my medications a few times, but never intentionally. He just.... Wouldn't set his next appointment and I had to keep track for him and call and set appointments every time he was being a jerk and I realized he was off his medications again  because he slept through an appointment (again) and didn't tell me. I was in charge of his mental health. I don't like playing the ""I have it worse"" card.... But, honestly, I feel like I do. He's older than me by almost five years and I took control of my mental health. He won't do anything but pills, reuses therapy. 

I'm so lost. I miss the man he used to be. And I regret breaking up with him over a dumb ring. But I know it was the right choice. I was so worn out, taking care of two people. I never wanted kids. It felt like I had one. He got a job, but only because I managed to pull strings and said 'if you fill this app out the job is yours'. He makes less than me, but not by much.

I wish I'd done it differently. But as it was, I couldn't have married him even if he had finally made the proposal. I wasn't happy anymore. It just took me going to his friends wedding with him and realizing ""that will never be us""- I literally couldn't picture us ever being as happy as the bride and groom were. I deserve to be that happy. I give my everything to the person I'm with. He wasn't capable of giving that back to me, and it's been six years of me hoping he would go back to who he was when we met. 

I don't know where I'm going with this. I just feel empty. I have to live with him until we find new arrangements and we live in one of the top 5 most expensive areas in the US. I'm going to need a roommate, I went into some debt taking care of us and never recovered financially. 

My entire world has been upturned. I know it was the right choice, but I have so many regrets. I wish he had taken me seriously when I said he needed help. Maybe it wouldn't have come to this. But I just couldn't do it anymore.",28Mar2019,14
11,"I’m an ardent liberal, and I’ve supported most things feminists have put forward, but a fear that’s always been lodged in the back of my mind is “when will they say that pedophilia should be accepted?” I have this mental picture of it being protested to be legalized, and eventually becoming legal, and then every single person who disagreed with pedophilia being seen as on “the wrong side of history”, like people who opposed integration and LGBT rights. I’ve already seen the seeds. MAPs and NOMAPS, it scares the hell out of me. Now there are two sides to consider in this. On one hand, criminalizing pedophilia has always been an issue undertaken by the left. But on the other hand, as more and more previously outlandish things become socially accepted I wonder when this will be the next thing. First gay marriage, then transgenders, then non-binary genders. I don’t have any problems with all but the latter, which I personally don’t believe in. I can already see how they’d justify it. Just as they used historical and cultural examples of multiple genders to justify being gender fluid and non binary, I can see them bringing up examples of child marriage being done for millennia. I imagine them calling it “natural” and saying that it “teaches children about their sexuality early on”. I might be looking too far into things, but it’s always been a fear for me, having experience with sexual abuse as a child. ",28Mar2019,1
12,"First of all.. there, I said it. I suppose I'm trans.

And I guess that's good and all, but for me it just feels like another piece of myself that I can't control. Something else for me to feel horrible about.

It's not like I wanted to do anything with my life. Nope. I don't have dreams, or hopes, I'm just this meaningless piece of life.

15,"My mom is a semi-closeted racist, definitely a misogynist, sees all LGBTQ issues as bizarre and laughable, thinks Catholicism is superior to every other religion or spiritual belief (especially Muslim), and she literally despises anyone who is politically liberal without any further information, and thinks they are inferior to her by default. It's a total hate-mongering shitshow. 

Anyway - what prompted me to write this was a recent exchange with her that got my blood boiling. I  work in a school district and encounter different kids daily, from different schools and grade levels. The area is very multi-cutural as well. The other day I mentioned to my mom that I had been dealing with 35 preschoolers that day, and eventually when I was looking around, I noticed that not a single one of them was white in the whole group. 

I guess I should've known better than to say anything about race at all to her... But I was basically just commenting in passing about how it was unusual for that to happen in an area that consists of at least 25% white people, and was just kinda wondering if it was sheer coincidence, or if maybe there's less white kids that are that particular age, etc. It was merely an observation that invoked some curiosity, and didn't have anything to do with any opinions about race. 

My mom, of course, COULD NOT address my actual ponderings, and had to launch into an emotionally fueled rant about how the non-whites are taking over, and how there probably weren't any white kids because their parents didn't want to subject them to having to be the minority.

I said: ""so white kids are above having to experience the exact thing  that kids *of all other races* have had to deal with forever?""

No direct response to that. 

Personally, I would WANT my children to be exposed to all types of people and cultures... to encourage compassion, respect, sensitivity, independent thinking, and many other positive traits. Segregation breeds discomfort around people who are different than you, which just reinforces that divide and fosters an environment where prejudice and closed-mindedness are ingrained and accepted. 

My mom ended up saying it didn't used to be like this, and that non-white people have come into our area and made us the minority. 

I told her it wasn't OUR area to begin with and that there's no reason we should have the inherent right to be the majority anywhere. It's weird as hell to me that she doesn't even see how entitled her attitude is.

Rant finished. ",28Mar2019,7
16,"Recently i've been affixiated with this other student at my university who is looking like a person that is going to be so successful. He has a startup that has won him many hackathon competitions, and even a major microsoft international competition. I've been stalking him on all his socials, and it just pisses me off seeing images of him showing his work to big time government officials like the prime minister in one instance. 

The university recently went through a major rebranding name change, which majority of the student body hates, and of course hes here sucking the university's dick on twitter. Cant believe the president of the school is retweeting a bunch of his stuff. The president of the school even gave him an ipad for promoting the new brand name (presumably on his twitter which has 400 twitter followers)...I can't even. The president is also going on about how his skills are being tested at a Tesla internship, which he didn't even get off his own merits...his aunt is a Vp of some department there and got him a placement.

I've never been this type of person but I can't believe i'm using my precious time I could be using to study just to stalk his socials to hate on him. His startup is actually trying to help people in the medical field and lower costs. I don't know why i'm being like this.

23,"Science Professor here.

8 of us went out for drinks one night last week. Tempers flared, egos got involved.

Trivial pursuit was the game. History professors vs science professors. 4 on 4. My mentor, our most senior science professor laid down the gauntlet.

""Let us bet more than monetary value. The losers will place on the line their very honor and dignity! If you are so confident, let us agree the victors will watch the losers run across the quad at midnight...naked as the day they were born, exposed as the fools they are, literally and figuratively, for all to gaze upon!""""

I froze. I'm only 26 years old. The fresh face of the group. I'm a freaking virgin. (that's how you become a science professor at 26, folks!) But I was told this was a ""lock"", and I didn't want to act like I had no confidence in my new colleagues (I've only started teaching back in September).

We lost. One by one, we shed our expensive clothes and took off running into the night. The cold breeze biting at our naked butts.

I won't name them, but my mentor is a 52 year old male with a ""dad bod"". His pot belly shamefully exposed to the world.

The other, a 33 year old male nerd wit, I have to admit, a surprisingly cute, round ""bubble butt"" jiggling behind him to the epic delight of our opponents.

A 44 year old female, in surprisingly good shape actually eccept for a pudgy slight belly she'sbeen hiding under her pantsuits, holding her big breasts like they were precious jewels.

And finally me, our freshest face, a 26 year old geek girl with a short haircut and a nearly flat chest, feeling like a high school freshman, buck naked for all to see.

All of us were confident. All were stripped and sent running bare.

I was the most respected young professor on campus. Can anyone guess why my nickname is now ""Cotton Tail"" once the story spread?",28Mar2019,0
24,"Every person I've asked so far has just stayed silent or agreed to the person I disagree with, I just wanna know if I'm the one in the wrong here. So for some context I'm 15 and a freshmen in highschool and has never shot a gun in their life. In biology today I was doing a test on computers and when we all finished we put the computers away, while I was putting my computer away a friend held a finger gun to my back and said ""give me your computer"" as a joke so I turned around stepped back and pulled out an invisible rocket launcher and loaded it with my invisible ammo and shot it at him. I thought it was so stupidly childish it was funny, he thought it was funny we laughed whatever. After class before I walked out the door my teacher stopped me and told me to stay and he needed to talk to me. He spoke to me saying things like in today's world and all the stuff going on that it's extremely offense to do things like that and that I should be ashamed of myself. At first I was baffled but was like whatever I won't do it again until he told me that he was calling my parents and the district about my behavior and that I'm going to get in trouble over this. I was dumbfounded and couldn't speak I tried explaining to him it was just a joke and I don't find it offensive because I've been playing finger guns since I was like 5! My question is, am I really in the wrong here or am I just surrounded by people who are easily offended because at first I thought I was just surrounded by snowflakes but now I'm starting to second guess myself...

TL;DR: Is it offensive to play with finger guns and go pew pew in this day and age?",28Mar2019,2
25,"Excuse me for the long and choppy and unorganized post. This is all spontaneous and I am too tired to try to make it sound poetic 

I have no motivation to go to school anymore. I have to wake up at 5:40 and I’m always so so angry waking up and then I feel angry walking into school. I don’t do my assignments anymore which I know is stupid because I’m a junior and junior year is incredibly important, but I just don’t have the motivation. I don’t do my homework, the only classes I actually try are in the elective classes and even in those, it’s barely. Right now, I’m supposed to be doing homework but instead I’m typing this and I’m just so so tired physically and mentally and I want to take a nap and never wake up. 


I’ve not been to a therapist and I don’t want to armchair diagnose myself but i know I am not mentally stable. Years of living poor and constantly having to push off dreams (“this year...” and then this year becomes next year and so on because doing fun things requires money), of hearing my family arguing over money, of living in a shitty apartment that’s a little to expensive considering it’s infested with mold and god knows what else, of having to live with our uncle- depend on our uncle during the first few years of moving here (who, by the way, is shitty and got into a fight with my family because he wanted my mom and dad to send my brothers and I back to our native country while my parents stayed in America because it’s “too expensive having us here” and when my parents said no, he left for weeks on end and my family (completely dependent on him at the time) almost ran out of food to eat). Years of all this have taken a toll on me. 

This is not the only thing. My mom used to (and still does) give me the silent treatment which lasted for hours and by the time the minutes turned into hours, I was convinced that she disowned me and I would start sobbing and begging her to just talk to me. The longest it lasted (a few months back) was 2 weeks of her completely ignoring me. My father needed to keep food on the table so he would work long hours (and when we couldn’t afford a car, he walked to his job and back) and I never got the chance to bond with him. I still remember the humiliation (and this is something I could never admit to him) when my friend pointed to a big building and said that her dad worked there and I didn’t have the courage to tell her my dad worked at a gas station  (New Jersey) so I lied and said that he was an engineer and that one lie led to two and two turned to three and for all of elementary school, I lied to hide the shame of being poor, of being an immigrant, of not being white. 

My mom and dad are incredibly caring people but I think they have their own set of traumas that they haven’t quite dealt with and that’s what brings upon their behavior. They are good people doing their best under their circumstances but if you asked me the last time my mother hugged me, I would say a couple years back, and if you asked me the last time my dad so much as touched me, I would say last year when he held my hand. 

Another reason behind their behavior is the culture and religion. They grew up to be Muslims and they expect me to be a Muslim. I am not allowed to wear dresses, skirts, shorts, anything “too revealing”, I am not allowed to hang out with any non Muslim friends outside of school (my mom said that I need to limit my friends to school only and the only time I can visit them is for a school project and in that scenario, she drives me there and back). One time I went to my friends house after school and I had told my mom before hand and when I came back, my mother was clearly giving me the silent treatment and she started telling me how I don’t even consider how she feels and “what will THEY say about me when I  allow my daughter to go out with all these people at 6 in the night. and then my dad agreed and I overheard him telling my brother to tell me to “control myself” and i could tell my dad was very angry as well. (and God forbid I talk to a boy, let alone date him.) I am not allowed to pursue certain hobbies (theatre and dance I’ve always wanted to do, but it’s “too slutty”)  My parents plan on putting me in an arranged marriage when I grow up, and expect me to become a housewife when I’m married. They also marry “in the family” (cousin marriage). This is disgusting. I thought I could get away with the help of college but they expect me to go to a college that’s near our home so they can drive me there and back home.  And if you think my parents are strict, then it’s important to note that in my extended family, our family is the lenient one. 

It’s tempting to say “just move out” but I will have to live with the guilt of doing so and if I did then I would not only bring shame onto me but also my mom and dad and they don’t deserve that. And, I believe my mom has already decided who she wants me to marry? (I remember her telling someone that she already knows and then she refused to give their names and with my brother she told the aunt to “save the daughter for him”). If she has me saved for someone else then saying no would also cause a ton of family drama. 

I don’t think I could ever move out because I can’t add more guilt. I already feel guilty for so much. Middle school years, my mental instability was at its worst and I was sad and anxious and I would hide in my room and I made them think that I hated them or something when in reality, I was just suffering. My own brother asked me “why do you hate us”.Even now, I can’t tell my parents I’m suffering because they don’t believe in mental illness. 

My grandfather also died on my birthday fifth grade and every birthday is so gloomy and it’s just not the same anymore. It’s quick and awkward and it’s not as lively as my brothers’ birthdays. 

And last school year, my father had a heart attack, and even though he’s still alive, I watched him die and his eyes turn lifeless and it was too loud and my mother was going into hysterics and my brothers were trying not to cry and I can’t cry in front of people because I have some sort of psychological barrier and I couldn’t cry and when they left for the hospital, I stayed home because it was too loud and I could feel myself getting a panic attack and it was too loud and when my mom found out I wasn’t going to the hospital, her expression turned murderous and I remembering thinking “this is it, she really hates me now”

And even now, my family hasn’t recovered from the heart attack. It’s not the same. My family has always been gloomy, I grew up hearing my mom and dad talking about how the world hates them and I remember eating breakfast while my mom and dad would lament over the hateful nature of our extended family and how we’re stupid and we’re too naive and aunt (name) hates us and what’s wrong with us and you get the point. But it has tripled since the heart attack. And the heart attack haunts us like a ghost and I remember having nightmares when he came back from the hospital about him having another heart attack and not being able to get to the hospital in time. I remember compulsively checking my pulse to make sure it was still beating. Even now, a year later, I get this tight painful feeling in my chest when anyone brings up anything to do with the heart. Even now, I can’t erase the memory of my father laying lifelessly on the floor with his eyes completely vacant and the police shouting at each other and my mother trying to push through the police so she could see him. 

The fighting, after the heart attack, has also gotten worse. When the family fights (I don’t participate in them anymore because there’s no point), it’s awful. A lot of it (besides financial issues) is about the heart attack and my brother addressing how he’s been depressed after the heart attack and my mom getting angry and saying things like “I should really slap you right now” or “if you keep saying stuff like that, then he’ll die and it’ll be your fault” and it escalates until it turns into her saying “I should just go kill myself and your father will die on his own” and “would it make you happy if I killed myself” and “she [me] wouldn’t even care if her mom and dad died.” The argument continues and it transitions into my mother telling my brother to never once mention the depression, or the heart attack ever again. And he says okay, everytime. And then 2 weeks later, the same thing happens. 

I am exhausted because of a “relationship” as well. I met a boy once and he made me happy, really happy. And he gave me so much courage and helped me get off my depressed ass and made me feel happy and long story short, stuff (mostly my fault and was caused by my insecurity) happened and we drifted apart and I had a dream a couple nights back where I was hugging him and crying and begging him to just talk to me and saying sorry over and over and he looked guarded (and this entire scene is oddly reminiscent of how younger me acted when my mother gave me the silent treatment) and I kept saying “I miss you so much. Please. I’m sorry. I miss you so much” 

I am also incredibly insecure. I do not think I am pretty. I have under eye circles and my hands are a little too dry and my teeth aren’t straight because I can’t afford braces and I have scoliosis and acne and my mom hates my hair (it used to be straight as a kid and now it’s wavy borderline curly. My mom once jokingly asked if I was trying to be black and when I tried to explain that that’s my natural hair, she explained that it was simply a joke. The only time she has ever complimented me on my hair was when it was straightened. When it was washed at a salon and it looked nice and pretty and undamaged and the curls looked better than ever and I felt so so pretty, she said “they messed up your hair”). people say I am pretty. That I have pretty hair. That I have pretty eyes. And that my smile is nice. People seem shocked when I call myself ugly. (To anyone reading this, I’ll gladly email a photo to you if you honesty think I’m pretty because that is far from truth)  i am ugly and people say I’m pretty but I think they are just trying to be nice. If I really am so pretty, then why do no guys show interest in me besides the one guy that I drifted apart from? Why am I still single if im so pretty? I have never received male attention whatsoever.  And people only say I’m pretty when I say I’m ugly. 

There are good moments in life too. Moments where my family is laughing and smiling and everything seems perfect. Moments when I listen to an amazing new song by an artist.  Last Friday was an amazing day and I was laughing so hard alongside my friends that my chest (?)/stomach (?) felt sore. Just today, in forensic science, we were doing a lab that requires taking out a strand of our hair and a guy was helping a really cute guy with pretty blue eyes pull out his hair (they were close friends) and I turned and saw the scene and I couldn’t help but stare and laugh (though I have a silent laugh so i doubt he knew I was even laughing. He probably just saw me smiling like a maniac) and then he turned to look at me and then he had this small smile on his face and and we just looked at each other for a while and it definitely didn’t mean anything to him, but to me, it made my day  (it’s important to note that no he couldn’t be into me because 1. he’s out of my league 2. He has a very very pretty girlfriend and I don’t advocate for cheating) 

I’m not saying I’m incapable of being happy. I have good days and I laugh and all that stuff but at the same time, there’s that heavy feeling inside of me and it’s as if a demon is clawing at me and trying to make me drown. Life is not what I had expected and I’m so disappointed and I’m so so tired

They have some trust issues with me and I get that. I know things won't be perfect over night but I don't know how to make it right. I'm a perfectionist and I am trying not to overanalyze things but I'm starting to give way.

33,"*I created a reddit account just to ask this question and maybe find help because a psychiatrist is not available in the province I lived in.* Please, help me. I can't live like this.

For a year now, I believed I have some type of amnesia where I forget doing the things I've done like wash the dishes or put my phone in a certain place. It has always been the small things like ""I don't remember closing my laptop,"" or ""I don't remember eating the only apple in the fridge,"" and I even thought I was haunted. I moved once, and I still misplace things. I stopped believing it was ghosts when my Mom told me I personally drank the coffee and even chatted with her when I specifically don't remember.

I left it alone, thinking maybe I do have memory-loss. But late-february to march, it started getting weirder. I would fall asleep and wake up, only to see I've skipped a day. I thought I was sleeping that whole day away but my friends said that I talked to them and even went out with them. Strangely enough, it kept happening that I would not remember what I did in the days that I missed. I broke down because turns out I insulted and cussed out a friend on one of the days that I don't remember. Two weeks ago, it got worse because turns out I was missing classes. I am a top student, I never miss classes. One week ago, I broke up with my boyfriend of two years. I WOULD NEVER DO THAT. Now he hates me and he moved on, leaving me depressed and afraid to leave the house. One night I woke up with a slash in my collarbone. I will provide the picture if anyone asks for it. But I don't remember doing it. I panicked, thinking I'm possessed. I went to social media to ask for help but I saw posts from my account that I don't remember posting. I CAN'T EVEN log into my twitter because ""password is incorrect.""

39,"I have always struggled with hardships. Had to overcome everything by myself. Never had anyone to lean on.

Lately everything has turned around. I have the love of my life next to me. Making great money (working for a great company where growth opportunities are frequent; 2 promotions in a year). I have a brand new car, my own place, and I’m still going to school.

As good as things are going, it’s so overwhelming. I wake up at 8, go to class till 12, go to work at 1 and get off at 11, do homework and go to sleep by 2. I repeat this everyday except my off days. I have almost too much going on. It is draining me to have a full time job, while being a full time student, plus all my bills. I’m living paycheck to paycheck to pay off my school. Top it off, I don’t think want want to pursue what I’m getting my degree in, but I don’t know what I want to change it to. No assistance. 

It’s like I have this evil voice within me, telling me to ruin everything, quit my job, drop out, get rid of my car, and let everything else be affected by the apple falling. OBVIOUSLY, this isn’t what I want. But it’s so easy to just give up and go back to my roots and fight to survive which oddly enough wasn’t overwhelming.

43,"Sorry for the rant, I really had to get this out of my system. 

I am so head over fucking heels over this girl. No one has ever made me feel like she does, I have never met a girl who gives off positive energy and joy and love like she does. It really was love at first sight, I can’t explain it, of course she is beautiful but it wasnt that, I just felt clinged to this girl from the moment I saw her, like that thing werewolves have in Twilight. 

Love is a very strong word. I know this is just infatuation, but like I said, nothing I have ever felt for comes close to this. 

Not even the last relationship I was in, and I was in love with my ex, but I could no longer stand her bullshit, she was horrible to me. But this other girl? Oh wow, she could spit on my face and I would thank her. 

We are friends, but I casually asked her out a couple of times when we first met and she did her best to come up with excuses. Few years later, we are both going to the same festival, but she is going alone, so she asks me to go together. 

I lost my shit. I almost shed tears of joy. I couldn’t believe I was finally getting the chance of being with her. Even if nothing happened, and nothing did happened, spending time with her feels me with so much joy. 

Here’s the deal tho, I’m a mess. I am a ball of depression, anxiety, and insecurities. I reek of weed and neediness. I am soo lazy and out of shape, I look disgusting naked. Literally the only reasons I can think of she might want to go out with me is because sometimes I’m funny and we have great conversations. 

SOMETIMES. Most of the times I am very shy and awkward. It is VERY hard for me to keep a conversation going, I am a very shitty listener, and I maaaaay be on the spectrum because half the time I have no idea how to act in a conversation. 

So we went out, had an fun night, it wasn’t great because I suck, but it was fun. Kinda awkward at times, but def a lot better than I actually expected. A couple of days later I tried to ask her out and it was a huge fail, I dont think I’m hearing from her again in a while. 

Best case scenario? She likes me but has no interest in going out with me. 

Worst case scenario? She thinks I’m a fucking weirdo but she pities me. 

I totally get why she wouldn’t go out with me, seriously, I’m not mad, I get it, I wouldn’t go out with me. Hell, I’d be suprised if she agreed, like wow seriously? You will? Whats wrong with you girl? I knew she was going to say no, I was sure of it, but I still couldnt help fantasize and feel hopeful for the future. 

Take my word for it, I am not exagerating, and I AM NOT fishing for attention like “Oh baby I’m sure you are a great guy!” No, really I am not, I know. 

Believe me dammit, she really is that fucking great, and I really am that bad. I’m not a bad guy, but I’m shit. I’m trying not to, I’m trying to be better, but I have a veeeeery loooong way to go. But the opportunity already happened, maybe it will happen again (doubt it) but I already screwed up too many times. 

Plus,d she doesnt deserve this, she deserves the fucking best. If we started dating I would always feel like I am not enough for her, because I know that I am not. 

I know its not entirely my fault for I am the product of the shit I have lived. I know that one day I will be better. I know one day I’ll find someone like that who will fall for me. 

But god fucking dammit piss balls cocksucking shit fuck fuck fuck fuuuuuck. I really wanted a break, I really want to be with her. 

Life offered me a prize, but I haven’t earned it yet, I have to improve sobmuch before I even come close to being worthy of consideration. 
I need to be better because I hate what I’ve become, and I hate myself for not doing something about it sooner. 

I’m still super grateful for spending the day with her, it was amazing, but I cant help but feel it could have been so much better if I was too. ",28Mar2019,0

47,"Right now, I am very drunk and all I feel is loneliness and depression. It’s why I avoid drinking most of the time, yet here I am, drunk off my tit and wishing I had someone next to me that I can be with. 

That person has come and gone however, and I know for a fact that I am not ready for another relationship, but I’m just so damned lonely.

Normally, I have no emotion, no feelings, as a result of years of depression and trauma. I cannot care about anything, even when its something that will affect the rest of my life, I don’t really care what happens.

But when I drink I get some vague feelings back, some twinkle of emotion. It’s all I’ve got. I haven’t been drunk since December 2018 because it was beginning to be a big problem, I was wasting most of what little I earned on alcohol and it was getting bad. I decided to slow down, and not get drunk unless it was with friends or whatever. I’ve broken that rule. But I haven’t felt anything in so long that I felt that I had to. And now I regret it more than ever, because all I feel is my crippling depression and anxiety multiplied.

I don’t know what to do, for when I’m sober, nothing matters and I’ll get nothing done. I won’t be able to care about anything, and I’ll probably just be... nothing. Yet when I’m drunk, I feel a little about things and am able to feel about aspects of my life.

56,"Growing up, I was always one of the smart kids. I was told I was gifted, I was placed in honors programs and AP classes, and school just wasn't that difficult because I was actually interested in it. I was in the band and had nerdy hobbies, and even joined the speech and debate club. I could get wrapped up in relationship drama, do after-school activities, and geek out with my friends while still maintaining my grades.

So, in my senior year, after my AP tests were mostly finished, I was coasting along until the end of the year. There wasn't much for me to do, really, since school had always been easy and now it was doubly so. I just had to finish up a few projects and pass my non-AP final exams (not a problem) and I could get out of my hometown and go off to college.

However, one project was drawing close to a deadline and I still didn't have anything done on it. My band director had been able to get us honors credit for the top-level band class, so long as we submitted an independent music project, like a transcription, arrangement, or analysis of a piece of music. I had just downloaded some music notation software, but so far all I had done was poke around and make some random melodies. It didn't feel substantial enough to submit.

At the same time, my honors English class teacher had been helping the school and some multicultural clubs prepare for an upcoming event showcasing food and art from around the world. I realized I could use it to my advantage: I could arrange some songs from other countries and have my band friends play them! That would definitely be substantial. I downloaded a few national anthems and started looking them over.

However, every time I started working on the project, I found myself bored, uninterested, and distracted. It was more work than I had done on anything in months. I copied them into the notation software, but all I had was a bunch of lonely melodies sitting on an otherwise blank page.

The weeks went by, and before I knew it, the multicultural event was nearly upon us. I quickly threw some crap onto the page, grabbed some of my band friends who happened to be free, and crammed us into a practice room to look over the music. However, my procrastination showed through with flying colors. The parts were incomplete or missing entirely. I didn't have anything transposed properly for the various instruments. Everyone tried to play their parts, but it sounded terrible.

We only got to ""practice"" a couple times before the event, but I knew. I had failed. There was no way I could show this to my teacher or submit it as a project. I was so ashamed of what I had done. My work was pathetic. The night of the event, I dragged myself over to my teacher and told her I didn't have any music to play after all. It didn't help that my parents had come to the event specifically to hear what i had written.

The event turned out fine, since they already had some loudspeakers set up and they could just keep playing the generic music they had brought. But my teacher really chewed me out. She was disappointed in me, which was something I had never felt from a teacher. I was devastated, and I asked how I could make it up to her. She said something I'll never forget.

""I don't care about the music, or about what you did or didn't do. I'm upset because you broke your promise to me. Until you show me you can do better, you can't really make it up to me.""

Those words struck me.  It didn't matter how smart I was, or what I could have done differently. It mattered that I had hurt someone else.

I did a lot of soul-searching after that. I read a lot of books, and stumbled onto the *Seven Habits of Highly Effective People* series. It made me rethink the way I saw myself, and he way I acted towards other people. It's no exaggeration to say I wouldn't be the person I am today without that failure and the subsequent period of penance and self-discovery.

Of course, I put together a different project and submitted it to my band director before the deadline. But my real victory, the reason I almost failed instead of failing completely, came at the very end of the school year.

After my final exam in honors English, I sat down with my teacher and showed her the books I had read, the plans I had made to be a better person, and told her how her words had changed me.

And she smiled and said, ""I know. I can tell you've changed.""

I'm sure in the grand scheme of things, the music for the event was nothing particularly important. But in that moment, I felt like I had earned back some respect. It wasn't easy, but I had done it. I hadn't failed completely. And in the process, I had become more than just ""one of the smart kids"". I had set myself on the path towards becoming a better person.

It was a failure I'll never forget.",28Mar2019,3

I always used to think, help everyone. Its like- what goes around come around. So i always helped everyone. Sending all my friends (more like classmates) notes and stuff, being there when they're down. And then when I'm in on the other end, they always leave me hanging. 
 Maybe I'm just glorifying all this. But i think I've been a doormat for quite some time. 
That won't be selfish right?

68,"Five years ago my father got into a really bad car crash where the car rolled off a mountain road. We didn't know if he was dead or alive for 2-3 days because the authorities apparently didn't do rescue missions during mudslide season. Eventually my uncle went down, dragged him out of there and got him to a hospital. But during those days I didn't cry and I wasn't worried. I just sort of accepted it. Months after the accident my stepmother kicked my father out of their house because he wasn't able to work due to his broken leg, neck and worsened eyesight. So my father, at 50, had to move back to my grandmother's house. I remember getting so angry that I wanted to go to my stepmother's home and hit her over the head with a baseball bat. I'm not a violent person. I've never had a real fight my entire life. But in that moment I felt like I had to do something. I don't hate my father, but I don't think I love him either. He just happened to be my father, and I happened to be his son.

&amp;#x200B;

Three years ago my grandfather died before I was able to see him, (Me and my mother lives in another country) and my mother didn't fly back until he had already passed because she wasn't taking the warnings from the other family members seriously enough. So we went to see his body, cremated it, attended the funeral, ate dinner. I didn't cry this time either. I again just sort of accepted it.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember telling some of my childhood stories to my therapist, and he started crying! I didn't understand how he could cry just by hearing the stories. But I couldn't, even if I was the one personally experiencing them. So I just went quiet and never continued.

&amp;#x200B;

And today, I broke things off with one of the few people I truly care about in my life. We had become more and more distant. So eventually I just decided to formally end the friendship instead of hoping everyday that things were going to change for the better. This time I felt really sad, and it feels like this is going to take a long time to get over, but still no tears.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is, why am I not able to cry to events like these? What's wrong with me? Am I a psychopath? I know I'm physically capable of crying. I cried as a small kid, and I don't have a medical condition that prevents me from doing it or anything (If that even is a thing). I don't drink or do drugs to deal with my issues. It definitely feels like being able to cry it out would make me feel so much better, but for some reason I just can't.

72,"Hello. This is my first post. I’ve always been a reddit lurker, so actually typing something out is both incredibly terrifying but slightly exciting. I just wish I was typing something more positive. But alas, here I am. I don’t know what this will achieve, hopefully it’ll ease my burden.  Advice would be much appreciated too. Just so you know a bit about me, I’m a 20 year old female uni student. Anyway, here goes. 

I broke up with my SO of almost 3 years this past November. He was kind, sweet, but he had his demons which eventually drove us apart. To this day, he will still always be my first everything and my soulmate. Since then, however, it’s safe to say I have completely gone off the rails. From not drinking at all to getting obliterated on a regular basis. From no drug taking to barely being able to survive without something to keep me awake, or something to calm me down, or something to put me to sleep. From being shy and reserved and respectable to sleeping with first dates, friends and people I truly shouldn’t. I have completely hit a wall with my mental health.  I have attempted once this year, hurt myself multiple times on purpose and just about taken every possible avenue to help me self destruct. I am in pieces.

I now think I have feelings for someone who couldn’t be worse for me. He’s a manipulative, alcoholic, drug-taking, womanising sociopath who takes the the term ‘treat ‘em mean, keep ‘em keen’ to the absolute limit. When he’s drunk he loves me, he uses me, then sobers up and hates me. And I. Can’t. Get. Enough. Where did my self respect go? 

Last weekend was the worst it’s gotten. I slept with 3 people, MY FRIENDS. One of which has a girlfriend, the one mentioned above and another who I crushed on since I was 16.   I did more drugs than I’ve ever done before, stayed up over 50 hours and spent my money that was supposed to last me 3 weeks expenses for uni. After every weekend, I return to uni (this all happens in my hometown) and spend the next week in a constant state of anxiety and shame about what I’ve done. Then I drive home Friday, and the cycle repeats.

I suppose this is a cry for help. I don’t really know. I’m in this rut, this pit of self loathing and I can’t get out. I have absolutely no idea how I can help myself. I can’t talk to my friends because they’re all as fucked up as I am. I can’t talk to my parents, they’re way too strict and if they ever found out I even so much as drunk in excess, the consequences would be dire. I just want someone to talk to, because I really really really want to get better. I can’t live like this anymore.

73,"Let me start by saying that I am a 25 y/o male and not someone that likes to hurt people. And when I do, I only feel the pain I thought I wanted to give away. 


This morning I saw that someone parked in my reserved spot where I live. I sat for a moment but looking back I wish I would have sat for a moment longer because I took it upon myself to write some dumb note to leave them. If only I stopped there because instead of leaving that note, I opened their gas cap just and walked away without really thinking. I was just so angry that I wanted to give them a scare or something by letting them find that their car had been messed with. Even typing that now makes my skin crawl with regret. 


I regret doing that so much that I called into work because I felt so embarrassed about how I reacted. 


The most embarrassing thing is that the person (another male around my age) fucking caught me as I was walking away and asked if I had messed with their car. I said yes and told them I thought one of my roommates friends had parked in my spot and that I was playing a prank on them and I apologized to him for the confusion. 


The dude seemed annoyed (rightfully so) but said no worries and we both walked away. 

I didn’t even make it to my door before I ran back to the parking lot to explain myself and let him know that I was in the wrong. Of course he was gone.

Well, this has been fun. By ‘fun’ I mean extremely hellish and both physically and mentally challenging. Food poisoning. I have it. And I’m on Day 3 of puking my guts out and shitting myself silly. 

This is the first time I’ve ever had food poisoning and I truly hope it’s my last. Fuck food poisoning! I want to shout it from the mountain tops. However, I doubt I could climb a mountain right now without throwing up and passing out. I had to walk down the stairs of my apartment building to throw away trash bags full of puke and the change in altitude paired with the revolting situation left me puking by the dumpster. Great. 

If I could go back in time to Tuesday when I forgot to bring food to work and instead ended up getting a salad from the near by pizzeria, oh mama mia, I would!  A salad of all things is what did me in! A fucking healthy ass salad. A $10 salad, mind you. I spent 10 big ones on a bougie salad, only to eat about a quarter of it and still be poisoned!

The first night was miserable. It’s harder to purge solids than liquids so everything I ate that day was revisiting me. After a while though I had nothing left to purge so I was dry heaving. If it was for my knight in shining armor who forced me to pound the fluids I might still be dry heaving to this day. But it’s okay because I’ve been steadily drinking water and then it coming out one way or the other (if you know what I mean *nudge nudge*). 

Hey at least it’s kinda like fasting which can be beneficial, right? I’ve only been able to drink water the past three days. I forget what food is like. Right now, consuming anything beside good ol’ H2O seems like a fantasy. Who knows how much longer this will go on?

If you’ve stuck with me this long through my tirade, I salute you. I also envy you for having the wellness of not spewing from both ends. Take care of yourself and be wary of food you get out-to-eat. I wouldn’t wish this fate on my worst enemy.

Listen, she’s beautiful. Men get weird about her. It’s actually fucking annoying. They gawk. They approach us while we are deep in conversation to ask bullshit questions about her tattoos.

I am invisible next to her.

I’m not unattractive, and I’ve had my fair share of suitors in the past. I get looks. Not entranced stares, no one’s drooling here, but I get a little trailing of the eye. But the past few years have been personally difficult, it’s hard for me to connect with people. Dating often feels like this peacock dance that I can’t help but find suspicious and distasteful. I like reeeeeeeally want a genuine connection, I just want to be comfortable, to be valued. I know I have shit that I’m working through, I’m just afraid that the mess overshadows the positive characteristics that I can contribute to relationships. I toggle between insecurity and self awareness.

I have beautiful friends. Inside and out, they are all crush-worthy babes.
I’ve been cheated on in the past with friends, coworkers, women who looked into my face and hugged me and said “love you!”, and “I just really respect you”, and “you’re so beautiful!”. I don’t associate with any parties involved anymore,
And I love my friends so fucking much,
And I know they love me.
I don’t want to be dated because I have hot friends.
I have absolutely negative desire to compete with them.
I’d rather fold into myself and forget about intimacy altogether.

But I was emotionally shook when a yoga teacher took 20 seconds to massage my shoulders and earlobes during meditation yesterday because it felt so nice, so distantly familiar to be touched in a loving way. My entire body tingled and I was hurrying to wipe tears off of my face before anyone opened their eyes.
It made me angry with myself for needing that.
It made me feel so lonely.

80,"Most childhoods begin with both parents together, happy and loving. As the relationship progresses with their new kid things, start to get out of control. Parents split, divorce and separate, it has many effects on kids some lead to being detrimental. In my case, my parents splitting made me who I am, and I’m positive most kids can say that.

&gt;*No man succeeds without a good woman behind him. Wife or mother, if it is both, he is twice blessed indeed. — Godfrey Winn*

My parents started off like many. They were happy, and together for a long time. Both my parents had children from previous relationships. My two brothers from my dad, and my older sister from my mom. I came into the picture in 2001, my parents remained together for the first six years of my childhood. Although a good amount was spent with them arguing. In 2009 my mom’s adoptive father passed away, my mom decided to move to Vancouver Island to deal with her dads passing, and collection of his property, etc. I was left with my dad, who had many problems at the time. The problems include drugs, alcohol, and the people he hung out with. From a young age, I was exposed to it all from parties on school nights, to waking up all alone and having to get myself to school. My dad would work from 5 am to late in the evening. He’d be most of the day, and it happened regularly. I was left alone to fend for myself on most days. I spent most nights staying up late and playing Call of Duty with my friends. I would make myself some food and continue playing video games. I honestly liked it, I enjoyed being alone, and I still do.

I started to become *very* independent. With my dad and I rarely talking he began to just trust my judgment. If I wanted to sign up for something, or go to a friends house, or leave the house at all, I’d just do it. I never consulted with my dad unless I needed his signature, which he’d give me whenever I asked. I started feeling like an adult, but I was only about 14 at the time. I started learning how to program computers and became interested in orbital rockets, and planes. I began to fall in love with engineering and science. I began researching and learning about rockets and engineering, I quickly became obsessed. When I turned 15, I went out and got my first job, mainly because money was tight. There was often not much food, and my clothes were getting old. So I thought I’d get a job and try and help out. I started planning for my future, education wise at least. I decided I wanted to go into Electrical Engineering, and my goal was to work on rockets and satellites. I had decent grades for high school, I was considered A/B student, and excelled in math and physics.

At the end of 2017, I had about $5,000 saved up for a university. Around the same time, my dad then went on a trip with his ex-girlfriend to Thailand. This whole time I was left alone at the house, with my dad’s friend checking in frequently. When my dad came back, he was short on cash and asked if I’d lend him some. He asked me to lend him $5,000 and he’ll give me an extra few hundred dollars, and to make it better he’d pay me back within the next 3–4 months. Since I had no use of that money at the time, I agreed. He paid the bills, stocked up on groceries and genuinely made the house better. I was happy I could help and didn’t make a fuss on him paying me back when he said he would. I allowed him to take his time, which I told him he could take a year to pay me back (He still hasn’t paid me back after 2 years.) I continued to work, and save money here and there. But I would never save more than a thousand dollars because I just didn’t have any motivation to save anymore. My goal was to save money, so I didn’t have to worry about money like my parents do. I accomplished that goal and was happy, and then my dad came along. Now the last two years have been full of financial stress, and to top that I’m only 17.

But all this has taught me many valuable lessons, on budgeting, savings money, staying away from drugs and most importantly being independent. My mom was a lifesaver, if I didn’t live with her for the first 8 years of my life I don’t even want to know who I’d be. My mom set great examples in my life, such as how to be on time, the importance of savings, and how to properly treat women, all of which my dad struggles with. **Thank god for mothers!**

Some white people I thought were friends turned on me and called me racial slurs online.

I don't really know why or if there's a name for this but I feel like I'm starting to despise people of my own race because of the racism I get, like being racist towards people of my own race if that makes sense. I've had it most of my life but if one of us dies a tragic death and it gets in the news it's seen as a novelty more than a person who died. Like if we die or something bad happens to us we're treated like dirt or our deaths are something to just laugh at.

I'm worried this may affect my job since my town is 99.5% white people so I doubt my workplace is going to have another person of my race so I will stick out like a sore thumb.

83,"Why is it so hard for me to accept help? No matter what it is. I’ve always had a distorted sense of perception since I was very, very young. Always thought my parents did shit to make my life miserable, even though they were just trying to help me. And now it’s bled over into my beautiful relationship with my fiancé.

We were talking about money and how I was upset he could spend money on lunch for himself and I don’t have the funds to do that. He suggested that I ask my dad if I could hold off on paying him my monthly car payment so I could have some buffer room, but I shot it down immediately because I “know” how my dad will respond and it’s not worth asking him. 

It ended up as a huge argument that I can’t accept help, but how it would be easier to accept help if he was more gentle about it. I want to be helped in a very specific way that’s unique to me, but he kept saying that sometimes you’re gonna get help different ways. In other words, beggars can’t be choosers. 

I know he’s right...I just get so frustrated and pissed of at myself for having such a hard time just accepting help. Or taking it personally or like someone’s trying to tell me what to do.

Not in the sense that, I can hurt you back. Maybe I do, maybe I don’t. One thing I do have control over, that you don’t, is my life. 

I have money saved. You don’t. I got my license and I bought myself a van. I set myself up with insurance money to last me the whole summer — That’s essentially my rent for the summer paid off already. 

I don’t know what your problem is with me, and obviously why would I agree with your judgements of me? But it just looks like you’re jealous because I have what you lack, I have what you desire, I have what you need... I have control over my own life. Do you? 

Why do you hate me for speaking up about the things I want or need? I work hard to afford I life I want — and that’s a life where I was able to quit my job I hated, and raise puppies instead. I do the hard work it takes to save my money so I can always have security - I do what I need to maintain control. And you’re trying your best to take that away from me, but you really can’t.

Your friends will all know you hit women when they stand up to your “right” to harass them. And then you’re going to go live on the streets and hope you get a job you want. 

We really aren’t that different. Your plans are taking you to the city, I don’t want to live in a city. You want to work in a kitchen, I want to work in a tattoo shop. We have essentially the same plan, but i have a van to live out of, insurance paid on it, and money saved on top of it. What exactly is childish about my situation compared to yours? The difference is I took control of my damn self and you didn’t. 

You tried, and I was proud of you, but now I regret ever helping you. For someone who would act so vile, I’m sorry that I was ever a reason not to commit suicide. I thought you had a drug problem, but it’s not that. You’re fake, you can’t stand up for yourself in a meaningful way, and you’re a bully. What kind of a person can pretend to be someones friend for so long, and even try and plan a business with them..? It’s absurd. And to top it all off, you act like you’re buddies with the guy who made you hate me, the guy who you tried so hard to convince me was a scumbag... you’re like a sociopath, with how two faced you act. 
 
I’m gonna be living a fucking awesome vagabond life and you’re just jealous cause you’re too much of a fuck up and a crack head to do it yourself! Every time you’ve attempted something similar you end up on the wrong side of a needle and maybe thats why it seems childish to you. But one day I’m gonna be renovating my dream short bus, with the badass anarcho-hippy of my dreams by my side. Have fun living in the hood and spending any extra money you ever make on drugs. 

And good luck being the fuck up you are, with no understanding of how trauma fucks people up. Cause the strangest thing to me is how you don’t seem to connect that my having trouble working in kitchens is related to watching my boyfriend die in one two years ago. You think I’m just being immature. Or that my panic attacks might have to do with that, and not so much about needing attention or sympathy.

Not only am I asexual (a 1% of the world that doesn't have sex (NOT ABSTINENCE)) but I'm also riddled with fetishes, and I have constantly felt like an outsider in every community whether its my home, any school I've ever attended, any workplace, and even in the gay community. I've never felt a legitimate connection to anyone in my life except for ONE of my exes, and he turned out to be horrible.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never in my 27 years of life held onto a job longer than 6 months, usually fired, sometimes I quit because I have extremely high anxiety levels that keeps me from acting like a normal human being. I still live at home and my parents know I'm suicidal, so now they walk on eggshells whenever they talk to me (more now than ever). They open my door without knocking and make me feel like I'm undeserving of humanity. My dad talks to me like I'm 10 and has done so since I was 16. I constantly express my feelings to my parents but they either forget or make it about themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to die because this world isn't for me. I'm almost 30 and I have nothing to show for it. I can't take things one step at a time anymore because that's all I've been doing and I keep getting set back. My brain doesn't let me function properly and I'm tired of being told mental issues can be overcome, because I've been trying my entire life and it hasn't worked. I'm tired of waking up and feeling sad because I know I'm worthless, can't hold a job, can't hold a man, I am literally useless and I am tired of trying to get better because I honestly don't see it.  


SO, to my dark web friends, I know it's possible to get a gun no questions asked because it happens every single fucking day, so please show me the website, or the encoded url, or whatever, I know it's possible, so please someone help me out and get me a gun so I can stop feeling pain.",28Mar2019,1
102,"She believes the government is trying to control the population and that's why everyone is moving into urban areas. Her boyfriend thinks he was born on an alien spaceship. He thinks that the Clintons are at the center of a pedophile ring and that they were behind the recent violence in New Zealand (where they live). They believe in chemtrails and they believe in the Illuminati. They believe in every dumb conspiracy theory I've ever heard and I have no idea where to go from here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a chronic illness. I would greatly suffer if it wasn't for vaccinations and to hear this from my own sister breaks my heart. I can't stop thinking about it. I have a very small family, it's basically just me and my sister and my mom. I just feel like I'm losing a third of my family and I don't know how to handle this at all. I don't know how to talk to her anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

They're not dumb people either. She graduated college with ease and he went to the best college in the southeast (US). They're just self righteous people. They don't listen. When I tried to have a conversation with my sister she smuggly told me that her and her boyfriend had ""been doing a lot of research and they understood what they were talking about."" As if I was just talking out of my ass? Her implication being that I was too stupid to understand why vaccines are bad?? 

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any subreddits out there for support with this kind of stuff? I just feel like I'm taking crazy pills. And my mom is over here being like,""well they have good points ... I'm not sure what's right anymore.""

I need some help, I need someone to talk to about this... I am just feeling very lost.",28Mar2019,3

104,"They know where I live, what my name is, all of that stuff. Those people who work for them are monitoring my every action on every device that I own, and even if I were to simply get a new one, they'll know that I bought it, and continue to make sure that I'm uncomfortable. There's no hiding from it all, unless this VPN does what it's supposed to, but even with it, who knows.

But even if I were to get rid of them, there are eyes everywhere. People can read my mind, and what exactly I'm thinking, they're thinking as well. Intrusive thoughts are never going away, either, they're hellbent on making my life a living hell until I finally succumb to it and blow my brains out. At least then, everybody will be satisfied.",28Mar2019,1
105,"I’m a 15 year old boy and I’m sitting here and I think to myself “I’m wasting my life by just sitting here”, then I got really motivated to do something, anything. Then I realised I don’t know what to do, and I sat back down. I’ve started to lose creativity and motivation recently and I want to do something with the parts I have left. 

So, to all the adults here, are there any things you regret not doing as a teenager? ",28Mar2019,4
106,"I've posted ads and on facebook and yadda yadda and now I just feel empty. He was the best dog I've ever owned, great personality, fun walker, such a snuggly dude. And he was my first pit bull, I've always wanted one and I was so happy the day I adopted him. He has such a loving personality and I just hope no ill will has met him and a good samaritan will at least take him to a shelter. Only just turned a year old too.

I just needed to vent somewhere.",28Mar2019,9
107,"I boiled the kettle and poured boiling water onto my arm.

I don't know how to react.

If it leaves a mark I could hide it from people I don't want to know, except at work where the uniforms have short sleeves. Even then a quick excuse could be made.

I just feel overwhelmed by everything.

I feel under prepared for everything coming at me. I don't feel like I control my own life.

I always feel like a coward. Hell, I couldn't even put my arm directly onto the stove and had to use the kettle instead.

Can't even stay true to my dark fantasies right.

Fuck.",28Mar2019,1

Just had to tell someone how awesome he is, that’s all",28Mar2019,2
109,I’m the type of person who hates telling lies especially to friends. I messaged my friend something I regret then I deleted the message on messenger and lied that it was for a different chat. There’s a high chance that he saw the first message already. I don’t want my friend to think I’m a lier. I felt terrible after it but I know I can’t tell the truth. It’s being troubling me for days and I don’t want to be like this anymore. ,28Mar2019,1

My father (somewhat new to the internet) has recently been watching videos on Youtube about random stuff. One time he fell into a rabbit-hole of conspiracy videos... You know, stuff like UFO's, 9-11 and Illuminati. First he was a bit skeptic but that changed quickly. He watched a whole documentary series about the Annunaki (It's basically about ancient egyptian aliens, stuff like how the pyramids are giant tesla coils to generate infinite energy and even crazier things... yeah). He really believes it...   


Right now he is watching a documentary about UFO's and extraterrestials and how the government has kept it secret. (It has a bunch of crazy claims which arent backed up and a bunch of cherry-picked, obviously biased or out of context interview clips and it ends on some bullshit about the aliens having free energy which is clearly impossible).  
Quote from a review:  ''A dreadful compilation of pseudo science. The presentation consists of monotonous commentary, stock footage and amateurish graphics. There is nothing positive to say about this.''

My mom is watching it with him and I'm scared she will get manipulated aswell  


I have been trying to get him out of this manipulated mindset because it is only getting worse and this is how flat-earthers are made. (though he at least thinks that's a stupid conspiracy theory...)  
I have gone through this ''phase'' aswell when I was like 13 but I remained skeptical and eventually found the truth to most of the conspiracies. Which is actually what got me to like science (right now im in a chemist-physicist education)  


Anyway, he's pretty deep in, having watched tons of Youtube videos, documentaries and even read books.

So... what do I do?",28Mar2019,3
