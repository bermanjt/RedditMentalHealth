7,"Just everything. If there's anything I want to do regardless of if I should or not I'll do it, and if there's anything I don't want to do I won't do it. I don't even think about it usually but when I do have no control whatsoever over it. I might sit and try to convince myself one way or the other but 100% of the time I'll take the worse option because it's just what I want.



Exercise? Never. I'll maybe do it once and then realize how much it sucks and not do it again for months.



Eating healthy? Also no. If there are snacks, drinks, desserts, whatever that I want I'll eat them. I'll never choose vegetables over chips as a snack or say I've had enough and not finish whatever food is available.




Saving money? Absolutely not, if there's something I want I'll buy it simple as that. I won't even think about it. There's about a 0% chance of me ever going to any store and leaving without buying something, even if it's just candy or something (back to not eating right.) Even if I try to save specifically for something thinking that'll motivate me it doesn't work.


Cleaning? Nope. I don't want to clean and I'm not gonna die if my room is messy so I'll just sit on my ass in the filth instead. I'll never do any chore I don't want to just because of that, I don't want to.


Homework/studying it's way easier to just not do them so I don't. 


Even stupid small things. I've never been able to stop biting my nails. When I play video games and try to just play it how it is but there are cheats available I'll use them. (I've been playing since beta and I don't think I've ever had a minecraft world where I didn't cheat). If I try to get up early I will absolutely 100% not do it because I don't want to.



I can't even function like this. It just makes me feel like a horrible horrible person. I'll literally never accomplish anything like this. I have the personality of a 4 year old. I have no self-control, will power, discipline whatever you wanna call it at all. Zero. And I've tried working on it but by definition I never stick to trying just like I never stick to anything else that's hard. If it's something I don't wanna do then I won't do it, and if it's something I want to do I will and I've never ever been able to change that despite years of trying.",26Sep2019,3

10,"I’m wish there wasn’t so much work.

I just started middle school abt a month ago. I was very excited because I heard how everyone said that you got more freedom and talked about how fun it was.

I guess they were wrong? The only freedom I say I can get is being able to walk to my classes by myself and talk to friends in the process. 

But they make it seem like having to balance 7 grades is fun also. 

I’ve gotten sadder lately with stressing myself to be perfect and have all a’s , making sure my grade doesn’t drop to anything lower than a 88 (which one of them have, and I’m pretty sad about that) and also playing piano.


I never really wanted to play piano in the first place, it’s just my mom that has been egging me on this whole time. I don’t have enough courage to just tell her I hate playing, and I wanted to quit as soon i I started. I feel bad though, because I’ve been playing for 3 years, and it would probably be a waste of money to her, which she could invest into my baby sister.

11,"How do you go about exploring your own unconscious mind? I feel like I am a stranger in my own head; there is someone I really and truly am, buried somewhere deep in the subconscious recesses of my psyche ... and I want to meet that person. I feel like I've been hiding and pretending, wearing a mask for too long. So, although it sounds strange: I want to somehow find a way of meeting myself. 

I can be patient and put in the time and effort. I'm not looking for an instant oatmeal, quick fix, pop psychology sort of superficial facade of self-improvement. I want to get to know the *real me* better. Like I said: I feel like I'm almost a stranger to myself, and that's become very concerning. I know there is something deeply unsettling within me: a conflict of what my conscious mind wants and what my unconscious mind expects. Sure, a lot of it is just the conflict of societal expectations. And that's something I'm trying to sort through as well. I know I'm a huge disappointment to a great many people: teachers and family members alike ... Hell, if we're being honest with ourselves here – I've let *myself* down. Things are pretty complex (aren't they, for all of us though? ... I oughtn't pretend my problems are any more trying than yours, or anyone else's ... but trivial though they be, these trials and tribulations uniquely belong to me and are all I know).

So, yeah: I'm pretty damned disappointed with the lousy, hateful, shy, hurtful, cowardly, slothful, unloving, unloved, ignorant, holier-than-thou fool of a hermit I have been for far too long. But there's precious little to be gained by beating myself.  No: what I'm really interested in is plumbing the depths of my own mind and learning who I am ... peeling away the layers of psyche to see the real me: the person I've repressed out of fear, anxiety, self-imposed exile.

I need to re-discover me: once I see who I really am, deep down inside, I feel I'll have a direction for self-improvement ... a vector to move slowly ahead in, making positive changes in my up-until-this-point-in-life pretty negative existence. Is there a way to re-discover the inner core of my being, or am I just babbling new age nonsense? I have to believe there are other people who have endured such a voyage of self-discovery. I don't pretend I'm all the special or unique. Surely this can't be such an uncommon journey? Surely there are countless other people throughout history who have felt the same such need and embarked on similar quests of self-discovery? And surely, in a helpful massively multiplayer online troubleshooter zone like reddit, there much be some like-minded individuals who could offer a gentle word of advice and steer a fellow traveler in the right direction? 

So how does a young, dumb, confused kid begin such a quest of growth, maturation, and spiritual advancement?

I get this is a greatly subjective, experiential journey of personal identity ... no one can do this for me. But surely someone could point me to a good starting position on the map?",26Sep2019,1
12,"Hi,

I'm a woman, never been on tinder or anything like it before, but at the ripe age of 25 I was bored on a work break. I joined and it's been an experience.

I always thought guys were exaggerating about Tinder being easy for women but... Damn.

Ive gotten multiple super likes that I promptly left swiped because they looked like weirdos, but it's wild to me. I'm not used to someone thinking I'm attractive. Like I get side eyed by people when I let it slip how I feel like a lumpy, bruised potato, so ik I'm not a dog. It's just validating? I probably have some dysmorphia going on tbh, and I shouldn't be seeking outside validation, but dang do I like knowing I'm not fugly.

The weirdest part is finding guys I know and matching with them when I right swipe just to see if they right swiped me. It's just wild. I matched with a guy I had a huuuge crush on in high school! And a guy I had a mild interest in, in college. It's weird y'all.

I also love having material for when I need some comedy relief. God damn are some of the redneck fuckboys I find cringey.

There's no real point to this post, just wanted to share my experience on Tinder in the first week. Maybe I'll find a guy to go on fall dates with and who can help host dinner parties, maybe I'll just get a confidence boost. Haha.",26Sep2019,4

Also no I didn't ruin his life. He will not be fired. He will not be badmouthed in any kind of way. He has still all the opportunities in the world to succeed. 

I thought I made it clear that I gave him notice for eviction. Meaning he had days to leave the property. That's why I am staying with my sister. It's not a done deal it's still in porgess but the biggest steps have been made. Jesus people



First of all I want to clarify some questions that came up in the OP.

-mark couldn't have seen my car and known I was home because I don't have a car. I don't drive I uber arround. Driving makes me anxious and I only do it when necessary.

-I don't work as a waitress anymore. I worked for the time I was in uni.

-Mark wasn't hired as a high exec right away. He didn't take the job from anyone. He started as a normal intern and worked his way up.

-they weren't joking. They have never made that kind of remarks in my presence. Also I doubt calling me a ""stupid trustfund barbie"" qualifies as a joke.

.............................

Update :

I was very tempted to play the long game and lead him on. But I decided to just present him with a prenup to look into his reaction. 

After telling my dad, we invited Mark for lunch and would serve him the prenup there. However to be sure about things I asked him if he had had anyone over, because our neighbors had  complained about lound noises. He said yes that his buddies were there. He didn't mention the girls that I saw.

We finished lunch and dad served him the papers saying that it was a must for getting married. You could instantly see that he didn't expect this. He got angry and asked me to speak to him alone. We went into the other room and he began babbling about blindsiding him and that this just really felt like a personal attack.

He was trying so hard to sell me the roll of victim and making me out to be the villain. Then he just said that he needed to think everything trough and left.

I have to admit I kinda broke down and began second guessing me but I could keep it together.

My family happily didn't pull the ""I told you so""ʼs. We looked into everything and I have the legal right to evict him. The lawyer handled everything. Wrote an official eviction notice. And after a lot of talk, dad decided to present Mark with a deal so that he would leave the company.


After that was all sorted out I decided to just simply text(as one of you suggested) ""Hey Mark, trustfund barbie here. As you said you would be free in 3 years I'll do you a big favor and set you free now. Kisses. Op""

My phone completely BLEW UP with marks messages after I send that. He texted and called me so many times I had to switch off my phone.

He came to my sister's place as he wanted to explain the situation. He promised that it was just a joke like a million times. I said it wasn't cutting it. They disrespected me in my own house, and I didn't want to be with somone that puts me down In order to appear better. He pleaded her cried he begged me not to end things. When. I wasn't budging he got mad at me accusing me of spying on him and ruining his life (honestly idk).

Then his manor changed once again to apologetic. He eventually owned up to the comment he made, still insisting that it was just a shitty joke. And then when I asked him why he didn't tell me about those random girls that appeared to know so much about me, he told me this weird story of them being cousins from on of his buddies and that they know of me because of my Instagram (shits private and I have like 30 followers).

I stood strong and I ended things with him. I will never know what exactly his plan was, but it's better to have things this way. We still have to sort out some financial stuff but after that I won't ever see mark again.

28,"This post contains extremely first world problems. I'm not looking for anything, but if I'm being a douche or whatever feel free to let me know.

I really like to drive. It's one of my favorite things to do. And I really like to drive a stick shift. I did have a stick shift car a few years ago, a [Ford Focus ST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Focus_(third_generation)#Focus_ST), but, among other reasons, I traded it in for a [Ford Fusion Sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Fusion_(Americas)#Second_generation_(2013%E2%80%93present)) when I got married to get something that was more of a ""family car"" that my non-stick-shift-driving wife could also drive. It's a nice car, and I really like it, but I really miss having a stick shift that I can just carve windy roads in. It's just not the same driving a big automatic, you know?

Some quick background, I grew up in a wealthy family with a trust fund (not enough to live on, I still have a job and make my own money) and my wife grew up solidly lower-middle class. So a few months ago I talked to my wife about trading in the Fusion for something with a stick shift. She was very against it, in part because I had only gotten the Fusion a few years earlier (and she didn't want me to get in the habit of recycling cars lest our future children grow up believing cars are disposable) and because she liked the car, we had done a couple of cross-country road trips in it and it had sentimental value. I only floated the idea of selling my car because she had previously mentioned she would be against us having 3 cars (two of mine, one of hers), as it was frivolous and wasteful. But when I asked again if she would be open to me buying a second car for myself, she said she would be. That got me excited, I shifted my focus from practical cars to more impractical sporty cars, like the [Honda S2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_S2000). 

Fast forward a bit and I tell her I'm just looking at those cars, and that decent ones range from $15,000-$20,000. She tells me that's absolutely too much, no way is she OK with me spending that much on a car we don't need. After getting married, we still haven't merged our finances, and I had more than enough money in the bank to pay for that.

Fast forward another couple of months to today, after some crazy stuff in our lives has settled a bit. I floated the idea of having my trust fund pay for this car, so that way it doesn't really affect our finances at all. Keep in mind this would be the first time I dip into my trust fund for a big purchase like this.  
She immediately said absolutely not, she's not comfortable with me having a second car just for me, it's a frivolous purchase and it just flaunts my wealth. She didn't allow me to say anything or make a case, she just said ""absolutely no"". She also added that there's a 99% chance she'd never be OK with me getting a second car just for me ever in the future. She's also uncomfortable with me spending that much of ""our money"" on a hobby, even though it's coming from my trust fund. She said we need to keep that money for retirement or emergencies, because it's both of our money since we're married. She told me it wasn't fair that I could spend so much on my hobby when she didn't have that kind of money to spend on her hobbies. She did add, however, that if I were to give her a check from my trust fund for the same amount as the car that she could spend on her hobbies, she would be OK with it. Essentially, she wanted me to pay her off to allow me to buy a second car.

She also told me she was extremely offended that I would even ask her if it was OK to spend that much money on something that was just for me. She called it extremely selfish and the most privileged thing she's ever heard me say, and that she would never ask me something similar. She also said it was extremely unfair, since she didn't have the money to do something similar.

I feel like shit now. Something I've been looking forward to for a long time was just shot down by my wife and said it would never happen after she had said previously she would be open to the idea. But, if I gave her $15,000-$20,000 she would be fine with it. I feel lied to and led on. She basically got my hopes up and tore them down when she changed her mind. I also feel dirty that she'd even consider asking me to basically buy her approval. It also feels a little weird that she has the final say over what I can and can't do with money that is still, at least legally, mine, based on her tastes.

I don't know. I don't want anything from posting this, I just want to ""tell"" someone. I don't really have any close friends to talk to. I just feel depressed that something I've really wanted to do for a long time has now been closed off from me. And I feel like a shithead first world privileged asshole because I'm depressed my wife wouldn't let me spend $20,000 of my own money on a car I don't need. And I feel weird that my wife was essentially bribing me. It's just all weird, and I feel like shit.

TL;DR: My wife said I could get a second sporty car, a few months later she changed her mind (unless I bribe her) and now I'm sad.",26Sep2019,2

My brother John has a decent job. He lives by himself in a small apartment, and always complains about being poor. He really just doesn't spend his money wisely. 

A few months ago, he bought a new microwave. He'd been needing one for awhile. He ordered a $250 microwave from a magazine/catalog, actually filled out an order form and mailed it in, and paid $50 in shipping. It took 3 weeks from the time he mailed off the form to the time he got his microwave. I checked online, it took me about 15 seconds, and I found microwaves almost identical to the one he ordered on Walmart/Amazon/etc. for about $60 with free shipping.

He has a computer. He has internet. How does he not know about online shopping? 

He spent $200 on a push mower. Please re-read the second sentence of the second paragraph if necessary.

He bought a $150 bike from a hardware store as a decoration for his apartment, but only spent $5 on a flimsy plastic deck chair as his primary seating furniture in his apartment. 

He spent $700, $1000, and $2800 on different bikes (like the kind you pedal), but he complains that he can't afford to buy a car.

He spent almost $200 on a palm sized John Deere lawn mower toy. I asked him how he can possibly justify that, to which he responded ""the wheels turn when you turn the steering wheel, and some of the levers actually work"". 

He doesn't have cable, so he constantly buys new movies on DVD. He spends more a month on new DVDs than what he was paying for cable... and somehow doesn't think that Netflix is a reasonable solution.

My question is, what words should I use to ask a professor who is egocentric, narcissist, (with no family life) to give us more time on work. He is known around campus to be egocentric and even the other professors roll their eyes when we talk about him. We want to confront him in a nice way because we still have 2 more semesters to go with him. I would RREEAALLLYYY appreciate if you gave me ideas as to how to begin and what words to use as I have never dealt with someone like that.  

Since we have 2 more semesters to go with him, we don't want to stay on his bad side so we are trying to come up with words to kiss his butt but at the same time, get the word across. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated!",26Sep2019,1

52,"First off, I don't know where to post this and also I'm frustrated with myself so I apologize if I sound a bit rude or all over the place. Don't even expect anyone to read this .

 I've literally had TWO guys give me the cold shoulder and I've come to the conclusions it's probably thinking that I am interested in them romantically...

With anyone honestly, I value friendship more really... if I am interested, I'll be honest.. truly. I know people don't hear that often but seriously I will be. I'm tired of playing games so if I truly feel some way I'll be honest.. Anyhow, I've noticed that asking to 'hangout' is synonymous with romantic interest and honestly, with realizing this, I understand it's my fault but at the same time... I mean come fucking on like jesus christ..... I am so tired of every man thinking i'm trying to score some date with them by just saying this..

Am I supposed to specify ""hangout as friends"" out of nowhere or something??

Honestly, I know I don't have solid proof but both guys eventually end up having girlfriends..so the timeline lines up.. as soon as I get ignored I see they have a gf.

Look, I'm not the type to constantly text and I'll take the hint cause I'm not here to get in the middle of anyone's relationship....but honestly this leads me to the conclusion that men constantly think I'm trying to be with them...

I JUST WANT FRIENDS. jesus christ and getting ignored just because they possibly think i'm interested bothers me... like I'm not...I swear on my life i'm not... I'm so tired of being treated like this. 

At first, I legit would ask friends if maybe I did something wrong as a friend to upset these guys...but I truly have never done anything and this is coming from someone who is pretty wary of what they do..

Anyways, rant over. Sorry I'm just so tired of this... like I liked these guys as friends... I literally had no interest in them romantically whatsoever... I'm so tired of being ignored and treated coldly just because of that

P.S. - One of the guys is actually a coworker of mine now and he treats me very coldly.... and the last message i sent to him was about catching up as friends lmao... like  I just really am tired.. i don't do anything and i get treated coldly... I take the hint (I don't text more than twice tbh) and still get treated coldly... like god fucking damn... it is truly tiring",26Sep2019,6

if our lives were movies, wouldn't DT be the best super villain that you couldn't even write - we truly live in times where it seems as though we are in a movie.

here is my bit 


imagine that both parties are for the majority, bought and paid for by the 1%.  there is just the appearance of choice, orchestrated to let us assume there is real democracy.

as it looks like the country is being divided of 'left' vs 'right', at least in the news they present it that way, the impeachment inquiry fires up donald trumps fan base 

now i read the facts on this story already, but let's imagine somehow much like how in amazement we were that trump even won presidency after hearing there was no way he would win, this actually results in him being impeached.  its seen as a win for the democrats, but treason to the republicans/conservatives/right wing people

this would be pulling the pin on the grenade, turning into an all out civil war never before seen

and it was all planned by the ""1%""

now a complete totalitarian dictator military dictatorship forms to bring order back to the US

millions die as the country falls into lawlessness

there is a 15 year period of disorder

order is eventually restored

56,"Being a calm and cool person is an extremely special trait which is becoming increasingly difficult to find in the hectic nature of our modern society. When a person is calm, his energy affects all the people around, bringing others an air of comfort and peace by making them feel that everything is going to be okay. A calm person is relaxed, assured, and stable, making him better capable of dealing with stressful situations and solving problems effectively and efficiently. Consequently, he gains the respect of others, is pleasant to be around, and abides joyfully in this world.

Today, I'd like to share two main ways to develop our inner calmness by highlighting how to increase our physical calm as well as our mental stillness.

**Physical Calm**

Because of our mind-body connection, the condition of our physical well-being has a significant influence on our feelings and emotions. If we can maintain a healthy body, our mind will benefit immensely, and we will feel an elevated sense of joy, calm and confidence, and overall positivity. We must always be mindful of the three basic yet vital aspects of a healthy body and monitor them daily. These three pillars of good health are: eating healthy, resting adequately, and exercising frequently. When we can manage these three things well, we will see a significant change in our mental well-being that in turn, leads to inner calmness. 

Furthermore, it is important to maintain good posture throughout the day to ensure the tension on our joints and muscles are properly distributed and that we keep our body parts in their rightful positions to minimize stress. Whether we are sitting, standing, or walking, our backs should always be upright, our shoulders should be pulled slightly back, and our necks should be comfortably rested with our gaze just a little lower than horizontal. We should always assume relaxed comportment and avoid tensing up our shoulders, jaws, necks, or legs. We can do this by practicing several rounds of mindful breathing every hour or whenever we can remember. We take a deep breath and fill our lungs up with a good dose of oxygen. Then on our out-breath, we send our body into relaxation by letting go of all the tension throughout our body that we have been carrying unconsciously. You can try it now for yourself to uncover just how much strain your body is carrying. After a few rounds, you are sure to feel a little more relaxed.

Every time we breathe in mindfully, we clear our minds of mental clutter and regain clarity of thought. And when we breathe out, we relax our bodies and let go of negative energies and emotional burdens that we've been carrying throughout. Over time, when our sleep, diet, and exercise is well managed, our physical posture is realigned, and we have regained mindfulness of our breathing, we will notice a sharp increase in our body's physical comfort. We will feel calm and relaxed wherever we are, whatever we are doing.

**Mental Calm**

Because we cannot physically see our minds, it is easy to forget that it also needs taking care of. However, not everyone knows how to care for our mental well-being, and so in many cases, we end up doing things that instead bring it harm and suffering. The first thing we should realize is that our minds are just as delicate as our bodies and is equality susceptible to negative influences. We need to show it as much attention as we do to our bodies.

The first thing our mind needs is our attention. How we feel, what we think, our wants and needs, our joys and pains, we should all be attentive to them, moment to moment. Giving attention to our mental world is called mindfulness, and without this quality, no amount of effort will bring us calm, peace, and happiness. Just as a mother cares for her newborn, never leaving it from her side, we should care likewise for our minds. Mindfulness is another word for deeply listening to ourselves, while maintaining a gentle, kind, and attentive position. This is the highest form of self-love, which, when practiced profoundly, leads to unconditioned joy and fulfillment. 

When we begin listening to our minds and giving it the attention it deserves, we begin understanding what causes and conditions lead to certain effects and outcomes. For example, with mindfulness, we learn that hatred and anger create much stress, anxiety, discomfort, while kindness and open-mindedness lead to pleasure, ease, and delight. When we witness with mindfulness that wholesome qualities lead to inner peace and happiness, we will naturally begin doing more good and less bad. We learn to live life more harmoniously, generously, and lovingly. When we listen to our minds and give it what it wants and needs, we will inevitably develop a deep sense of calm and confidence.

But of course, mindfulness of our inner world may also lead to the discovery of negative emotions, suppressed memories, or even bad thoughts that bring us pain and sorrow. When this happens, we must fight the urge to turn away from our hurting mind, but instead, show it the great care and concern it needs most. The best way to deal with such situations is to realize that like everything else in the world, these thoughts, feeling and emotions are temporary, transient, and have the nature of arising and passing away. With this understanding, we develop patience which is the best virtue to help us manage unfavorable states. With a patient mind, we listen deeply to our pain, embrace it as a mother embraces her baby, and remind it that everything is going to be okay. 

When we develop mindfulness, patience, and wisdom of impermanence, we naturally give rise to great inner calm, because we learn how to create good states, how to manage bad ones, and realize deep down that no matter what happens, everything is going to be okay.

**Conclusion**

To realize our inner calm, it is important to establish healthy lifestyle habits, a healthy body, and a connection with our breath. This will inevitably bring a great sense of physical calm and comfort. To cultivate our mental calm and comfort, we must practice mindfulness, which is simply the practice of deeply listening to ourselves. Then, we create positive states by developing wholesome qualities like kindness, generosity, and empathy, while learning to manage negative states with patience and the understanding that all phenomena is conditioned and temporary by nature. 

If we can internalize these ideas into our everyday lives, we will naturally feel a deep sense of calm, joy and fulfillment, knowing that we have a way to deal with everything life throws at us, and at the end of it all, everything is going to be okay. I hope reading this has brought some benefit to you, and I sincerely pray that we all realize our inner calm, peace, and joy.

May we all live happily, healthily, and harmoniously, and work together to create a wholesome, vibrant, and joyful world for our families, friends, and all future generations.

Thanks for reading 😊❤",26Sep2019,2
57,"I've been depressed and reclusive for weeks recently barely doing anything outside from going to class. Everything sucks and I finally started to get out of that funk today and walk around, then tonight I was walking home with some food from my favorite place nearby and got ganged up on by a group on teens. There was maybe 15+ of them and only a few hit me but I was scared. Right outside my place, they didnt rob me or take anything but my sense of safety, my reclaimed want to be outside and my dinner.
Right now I'm terrified to go out, I know it's not likely to happen again but I am scared. I'm probably going to skip class and finally set up a meeting with the therapist at my school.

I'm just feeling really worried because she's under so much stress. She goes to a private college and they gave her waaay to many credit hours, and all of her classes require the upmost attention and time outside of class. I wish there was a way I could help her other than reminding her that I'm here for her and that I believe in her. It doesn't help we rarely get to see each other, and our communication is pretty sparse. However hard this relationship has been on me the last few weeks, I know she and I will be okay, and that we're going to do great things together in the future.

59,"The voice in my head is not mine. It sounds like me, but it is not my voice. It's the voice of a disease that tries to cut me into pieces, that has made a home in my head for a very long time and has studied my whole life. This voice knows every mistake I wish I could take back and knows how to maximize the hurt and sorrow. I try to fight back. And in the light of day, I can fight back. But at 4AM, I feel weak. I don't have enough energy to fight back. My brain is telling me the same things over and over again. I deserve to be alone. I am going to fail. Scars have already made me ugly, so I should keep hurting myself. Go get the razor. There is no reason to keep going. I deserve to feel shame. I am a bad person. I am broken. I don't deserve you. I don't deserve anything. I have nothing to offer. I am a burden. You would be better off if I was just not here anymore. The whole world would be better without me. I am not a good enough friend. I am not a good enough daughter. I am not a good enough partner. I am not enough. I am not enough. I am not enough. Notenoughnotenoughnotenoughnotenough. 

When I believe these lies, I start to spiral into suicidal thoughts, which then lead me to panic. I imagine this is what drowning feels like, only mentally. But I made a promise and tonight your existence is my reminder that there is good in this shitty, shitty world. There are days, like today, when everything is scary and I can't help but feel despair. In these moments I have to remember there are also days I sit on top of the mountain you don't even know you built. Where we laugh and smile and know I can make it through this.

What took me over the edge was that recent Reddit post of the fresh cow meat twitching wildly from having salt poured on it and now I just can't do it anymore.

All I can think of is that cows have been designed (through selective breeding and stuff) to be food.  They can't survive in the wild and all they're good for is to be drained and chopped up and that's not even remotely fair.  They're sweet and gentle, timid creatures who just want to live and have a good time. Chickens are kind of getting on that level to me but we shall see.

He had to be airlifted to the city I go to college in and is at one of the best centers for this type of injury in the country. They have conducted surgery to remove part of his skull temporarily and last night they had to put him in a coma. His prognosis was full recovery as of yesterday but I’m not sure how the coma is going to change that.

Climate change is real, is a reality that we are facing.  

I used to be part of a climate organization, small one, but it was something. I wanted to contribute and I was given the opportunity to make climate awareness more interesting, but since I wasn’t the “leader” of the club I couldn’t do much about the ecological events since it is organized by the president of the organization, obviously, listening to our ideas. 

The thing is....

They never left that cycle of speeches....

I was expecting something different than spreading fear. For me, if we want people to understand climate change and how can we do
Something about it is educating them by awareness. The speeches were all about climate change but no explanation on how can we apply a better lifestyle (Eco-friendly). What caught my attention is how many speeches the organization  has done  than doing something (action) sure going to schools and places is something but is not what I consider as “action”. 

Actions are louder than words.

When the “superiors” were asking for ideas for the next “speech”, I suggested we do an activity than a speech. Something fun that can make you have a good time but at the same time be  eco-friendly. 

“Teaching people to recycle by being creative” 

I wanted to do something different and interesting, something that does involve talking about climate change but at the same applying it in a fun way. Not by just sitting in a conference room listening the same speech, over and over again. 

For example: ways of recycling your clothes or how you can create art with your old things. 

That was my first suggestion. Basically, like give your old jeans (or anything you don’t use anymore and want to throw it away)  a new use or doing art with it. Something like that. The activity was about bringing your old clothings/things and doing something with it. Like, you can transform your jeans in a collage work, give it a retouch, etc... or if you have jars that want to throw away you can bring it, think about another way of use like transforming it in your own personal piggy bank (you can paint it, add your personal touch with materials you don’t use anymore.) 

Imagination.



It was  like a workshop that uses your imagination, the activity was for all ages: children, teenagers, young adults, adults, you name it. I didn’t want this to be only for school, and also because I want to give this organization a new light than just speeches because seriously how many of us have hear climate speeches about the same thing? Is good, speeches are good, but we need action. How can we do it? Creativity is a way of tackling this situation and I wanted this activity to be fun.  

The “leaders” liked the idea and went with it, they told me that they were going to do the activity, and wanted me to assist. I spent my time organizing it, searching for ideas, and doing the invites, also searched for artists who created art with their old clothing, etc... the date was set for March 15, 2019 at 4 pm.  


I was super excited because finally! We were going to do something different! But in two weeks my strive for something different and all the hard work I put for this activity was erased like it never happened.

In two weeks, after I had already contacted artists  who agreed to come, and made a reservation (place the event was going to take place) the organization’s leaders called me saying that they are going to cancel the activity and change it into a speech because well they wanted the speech because it was convenient. 
The activity was not going to take place.
I had to cancel everything, the reservation, the artists invites...everything. 

I was disappointed and sad, as I was called t attend the seminar which was about the same damn thing in a conference room in some building that I don’t remember the name of. The same used speech. The people who attender were forced to be there by the school (their targets) basically, they were no longer paying attention to what the guys were talking about, and I don’t blame the because I recognized various people who had already heard this speech. 

The project that I was going to be part of was moved aside, transformed into a summary like examples of recycling, that’s all. It was like short examples and then they congratulated themselves for being creative. Added an old video made in 2001, and that’s it. 

The speech lasted around an hour. 

I just didn’t know how to feel...
I guess I was expecting too much from the organization, perhaps, I got too excited. I don’t know.

But I still believe in action...",26Sep2019,1

90,"I had a clothes moth problem a while back. And I bagged up all my clothes, checked them regularly, and physically killed any flying moths or crawling larvae I came across. I finally got rid of them since I didnt see any anymore. 

Then the gnat problem happened. I physically killed those and got over THAT problem (wasnt too hard). 

THEN..... while cleaning my place I was using my vacuum (which was pretty full of dirt/dust). And went to empty it. I opened the dirt container and dumpted the contents into my trash container. When it came out and hit the top of thetrash.... about 15 tiny moths came flying out of the dirt. I was kind of speechless. And unable to do anything without spreading dirt/dust everywhere because I had the container and filter in my hands. Felt helpless as I watched these little fuckers get away. And they pretty much disappeared quickly.

I put the container and filter down, and killed one moth I saw on the rim of the trashcan. Then pulled the bacg shut just in case more was in there. 

I guess they were breeding like rabbits inside the vacuum dirt container.

91,"I started at a new sixth form and I feel like it's a loop of what has been happening for 5 years in secondary.

People's thoughts of me aren't fully set in stone but they are close to it. I haven't made any real group of friends and I've been sticking around with one close friend I've had since secondary and I feel like I'm holding them back from making new friends, despite how much she denies it.

I feel like people think I'm sensitive, nervous and an absolute freak of nature. I am for sure, but it means they'll be more wary of what they say to me and what jokes they make and I hate it. I can't make real friends and get over that barrier.

I got called up to do a brief 2 minute overview of an experiment, and I was involuntarily picked so I chose not to make any eye contact because I knew I'd be thrown off if I did. At the very end when everyone clapped (heh) I happened to Look at a guy. This guy happened to make eye contact with someone else and kind of gesturing about me. That made me realise I've become the kid I was in secondary again. It's extremely hard to change that once everyone's thoughts are set on you.

I found it alarming when my friend Jenny thought I was lucky I was 87 pounds at one point and wanted to gain weight after I dropped my weight during my flu) She also has been showing me pictures of women with very pronounced collar bones that I suspected were anorexic. I tried warning her that she should eat, and that having a high metabolism isn't always great and that with her height 110 is way too thin for her. No matter what I tried telling her she's been telling me how it's going to work,  she's going to be thin, nobody is going to stop her. I tried explaining to her that she's lost 10 pounds due to not eating and that she's going to be super thin and unhealthy. 

Later that day, I screen shotted the snap chats (probably a bad idea on my end since snapchat tells you when a user does it) and sent to my other friends who was friends with her to tell her what's going on, and she told me about  Histrionic Personality Disorder and I noticed that my friend shows a lot of the same symptoms with weight. At this point I'm frustrated because she won't listen to my advice but also she'll bring up her weight and weight issues then when I try to give her advice and get her to see how what she wants to do is unhealthy she'll tell me how she wants to change the subject and I don't know how to help her at all and it seems like nothing I do sees to be getting through to her. What should I do about my friend?",26Sep2019,1
94,"Thanks for reading. This is just venting, I guess. I am looking for some sort of response, but I do realize that if I was an actual AC vent that I would be very reliable.


It started earlier this year. My friend was getting married but he was also treating me like a drug dealer. He would ask if he could get some pot from me, I'd bag it up, and be waiting for him to give the ""OK"" that he had the time to see me and the money as he has a bad habit of just forgetting he owed people. The call would never come. Then I'd find out I would get passed off for other friends and activities. Well, when he invited me to his wedding I was at a cross roads. I could suck it up, enjoy myself at a wedding, and be supportive of my friend. The other road gave into my dislike of his fiance, I'd give in to my annoyance of how poorly he handled our falling out of a D&amp;D group I was instrumental in setting up, and the not following thru on plans.


I didn't go. We haven't talked since. My dad wasn't talking to me at the beginning of the year. It wasn't until I was employed again in February that I called him and acted like every thing was okay. Well, months down the road and he's back at it again with the attitude that set us apart to begin with. Last weekend was his birthday and everyone was having a go at my expense. I just had no idea what their deal was and at no point did I feel he'd stick up for me. I can't stand the idea of calling him anymore. His attitude about work is different now from the guy who helped raise me every other weekend.


My mom is probably the biggest reason I'm at a job I can't stand right now. I'm working a dead-end cubicle gig that's making assholes above me money. I'm so tired of it. I have so much resentment over the way life has turned out. At every corner of my upbringing I had little guidance beyond ""No."" and screaming. So often I remember her constant screaming at me. Stuff I hope I never say to my kids (if I ever have any?) I had so many ambitions shot down by a lack of support. It's this outlook on life where I can't have a ""want"" because that want won't work out. I feel broken. I have nothing I want except ""nothingness"" which I can say might be misconstrued for wanting to take it easy and relax, but work and this job doesn't let me ever have that peace of mind so I am just unsure.


My friend has a group of online friends that have never taken to me regardless of the fact I'm there almost every night and pal'ing around. The other night it was just some shit that always happens. We all talk about something that should be done and no one has a forward enough idea to suggest anything. Except me! I always have an idea and as usual I suggested it and was fucking laughed at. My idea wasn't even acknowledged and it mostly came from my friend's actions and words that lead everyone to decide they shouldn't acknowledge my idea. How can a group of grown adults not take the seven seconds it requires to validate someone who is definitely a part of the group? I'm not even thinking about how I'd reconcile that hurt that's been building up for years.


Dumb, right? I still have my loving SO that I finally get to see tomorrow, but I'm nervous. How long until she makes some weird, ill-precieved slight against me and I turn on her? She's my last person that's directly a part of my life that I've yet to be upset and disappointed with. But then I think about stuff long term. How I can't just abandon everyone because that's wrong (right?) and I know I'll get bored and lonely one day soon and all the regret will wash over me and drag me out to sea.

107,"Good afternoon r/self,

&amp;#x200B;

I am here today coming to you as u/idfkCOLLEGEhelp (I am in college if you didn't notice :) )and that right there states my current state of mind at this very point in time. This situation, indirectly, started a year ago, maybe to be as precise as I can be. I used to room with a person that I am friends with. A semester with them, I was quite honestly a bad one, which means I stayed home all the time played on the laptop... yeah. I was cringey in the ways that I acted, some times here and there and stuff. Things went on, and we have our neighbors who we knew a bit about. Anyway we have a communal shower, coed shower, and one morning, I was about to leave my room to use it, and then one of them rush in and guess what. They don't even say a word and now take it. Does that seem right to you? Is that normal behavior in respect to me? 

&amp;#x200B;

Any who, time went on, and towards the end of that school year, I did not hear a sound, and coincidentally I walked out of my room to use the shower at the same time one of them was going back to their room from the bathroom. Of course, I did NOT mean it and did not want that to happen, but considering some times they did some things like that to me, it overall wasn't a fun experience. It made me seem like I was very impatient, and I am not an impatient person. I wish we could both do a forgive &amp; a forgive, which I think would work out greatly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Months passed, summer break happened, and I'm back here. I was a bit happy to return, knowing I could get back into my studies, do my thing, and maybe try a couple of things out. Well, not so much as of this moment. I've been in class with this one person, and for example, I have glanced at them a few times (ie., locked eyes). Now, this semester, I've done it a couple, and now I am seen as public enemy #1. Let me tell you why. I've known/seen them a bit. Like if I'm in our eating hall, I have locked eyes with this person twice, this year. And then I see them speaking to a few of these people real quietly, like I mean I can't hear. They look over when I pass by them, and sort of maybe laugh a bit also. Again, I am not that great of a hearer, probably because of my ear wax (sorry but I need to let that out very awkward I know). Not that recent, but recent, I saw the person and her friend laughing and I can sort of see them looking over a bit. And that is after I've sat down and stuff. The dorm friend of mine, now still a usual eater of this hall, tells them something in a super quiet tone after I've arrived, and I can't help but think it has something, negatively, to do about me. Time passes and stuff, my friend and I exchange a few words, and then go our ways for the day.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, now that I've sort of let out the whole confusing, backstory-less story, let me give you some facts. I've always been a pretty weird, shy type of guy. I can read body language good enough I feel like, sometimes better than usual. NOW, moving onto my room friend, who I am on a sports club with, it's been a good years being with this person. Once we finish the practices, I go inside, and we all speak to each other, fun things. But, since I've returned, it's seemed that they have just sort of grown to be intolerable, some part to me. I say something, then maybe the room friend glares for a bit, then laughs, and then seems to move onto the next thing right away. I have not done some things that we are supposed to do, such as maybe just resting for a bit during a cool down, then they grow very intolerant of me sitting down. We used to happily say things to each other, do this and that together, but now it has just turned into ash, I feel like. Not to forget that he still is friendly or in connection with the person that had the bathroom incident with me. The bathroom incident person still sort of looks at me, whispers to others, I am sure, cause I've seen them mesmerized by my appearance before, like it was a super shock to them. And their friends always keep their distance, or barely utter anything to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

One last thing is that I've seen something I think I am not supposed to have seen, and that is about a former person who I'd say I was close with as a team member. When I speak to my room friend, after we do a practice, about when so and so is returning, after I have noticed him walking on campus a couple nights before, and I was not notified, them and a few others look down as if to dodge the question. Is that some normality? Am I going insane? Is all of this too confusing? And if it is please PM me cause I am just very frustrated. I feel left out and I don't want to tolerate it that much longer.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I just have to vent and I have a very, very strong gut feeling that this isn't some sort of blown up ordeal. I've felt these things happening and it has been super clear. Also when I left one day, when I was doing this activity with the club, and said goodbye, only one person, not the friend, said goodbye. And I was quite loud with my farewell.  Help me please.?",26Sep2019,1
108,"I'm having trouble knowing who I am.

I am the sort of person who has never socialised much in college. I felt the whole ""my squad"" thing was bs. I couldn't connect with most peers in the 4 years of my college. And I never really interacted/initiated a conversation with people who weren't on the same frequency.  
When I was a fresher, I saw people around me trying their best to make their first impressions. They initiate conversations about TV shows and movies which are trending and have surface level idle conversations while injecting their personal opinion about a character from show and why he deserves to die. I just felt that the whole charade was .... pointless. I watched this social circus unfold as I put on my zombie poker face and sat back in silence. I never hung out much with my batchmates and never really got close with anyone in particular. From my observation, most people found atleast a guy or two with whom they always hang out, eat together , sit in the class together etcetera.  
During the final year of college, I realised that I never gave myself a chance to bond with other who are different from me.  
I was lonely.  
Looking at my peers recollect their college memories made my camera roll and heart feel empty.  
Due to some personal loss at the beginning of the final year, and after a change in perspective I realised that my social life was an integral part of my wellbeing and happiness. I was usually content with my solitary life but evolutionary biology caught up to me, for I am a social being after all.  
Now I'm trying to connect with people but I face problems. When I try to get into the same frequency as the other person and have a conversation at their level, I feel I'm faking it. I feel like I'm not being me anymore. And in this dilemma the people never seem to like me much anyway. I want to build a healthy social circle but when I try to put my self out there and try to make ideal talk(which I taught was lame back then, still do I guess, but now I know it's worth) I feel like I'm not being myself ya know.  
I have never had a constant handwriting. I always used to try different styles depending upon my mood that day or how determined I was to make good notes. I feel like my character is the same way. I don't seem to have a 'fixed' me or a real me. I'm just trying to experiment which behavior works best in this social world and so far everything has failed and the identity crisis I'm facing doesn't help.

It's been 5 days since i've started 9th grade yet i've only went 3 days. But i know nothing bad'll happen if i go, it's just that the more days i skip, the more the anxiety about it builds up. I start thinking that the teachers'll get mad about it and get scared.

It's not a problem with waking up early either. I wake up at exactly 7AM every single day, weekend or no weekend.

I really like school and i'm friendly with everyone, i don't exactly have good friedns yet cus it's been only 3 days but there are some kids i hang out with.

113,"I guess I’m really only posting this to vent. I just don’t know what to do at this point. Today, my cell phone just got shut off for non-payment. My bills are piling up and I genuinely am out of ideas outside of hoping for a miracle. 

I worked in IT up until a few months ago. 3 to be exact. I was fired because the owner of the company wanted something done, but me and my boss were busy trying to fix a major network outage we were having which shut the whole building down. The second day, after fixing the outage, I began working on the project and got a call from my girlfriend who was having sever kidney pains (we only have 1 car and 2 kids) and she needed to go to the ER. She’s not the type to even complain of pain so when I heard he crying I freaked knowing she’s had problems with her kidneys in the past. So I called my boss, explained and was told to leave and take her (two hours early). So I did. We were at the hospital all day and she almost needed to have surgery. They kept her overnight to monitor and see if a surgeon was needed. Thankfully she didn’t and got to come home. She had 3 large stones by the way. 

I went in early the next day and just started working on the project and was met by my boss and the owner who told me I was no longer needed there and to get my stuff and go. Now, I was underpaid, overworked, and it was crazy strenuous but I loved it. So that hit me hard. I immediately filed for unemployment and put out my resume and applications everywhere I could. I still haven’t heard anything back from anywhere despite putting a minimum of two out a week. My bank account was overdrafted until yesterday trying to salvage what I could. Today, my phone got shut off so I had to schedule a large payment for 48 hours from now into my newly not overdrafted account with no income outside of a meager unemployment payment which won’t cover anything. 

I just can’t stand feeling this helpless. I’m 25 and I’ve been through hell my whole life, but this is the first time I genuinely feel like I’m out of options and don’t know what to do.
