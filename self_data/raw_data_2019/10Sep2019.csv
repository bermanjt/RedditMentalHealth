1,"So, i hope you don't mind a bit of text, dear reader, because i like to go into detail on certain subjects. I'll try to shorten it and leave out the less important parts. Also, i should warn you beforehand, there will be no explicitly supernatural happenings in this story, only a small breakthrough of mine that i would like to share and hear your thoughts on.

Anyway, it will be 2 AM in a few minutes from now. At 11 PM, i was mindlessly playing videogames. Almost totally spaced out. As i casually browsed Instagram along with it, i saw a meme about your friend suddenly becoming a comedian when your girlfriend is around. For the female readers who don't know, it is considered a big point of jealousy when a girl you like laughs at someone else's jokes, especially more than at yours. Anyway, this somehow made me think. I am a shy, reserved, generally unhappy with my life person for a long time now. And i imagined myself in some time, when this exact type of thing might happen to me. I will be there, with my girl laughing at some other witty guy, while i just sit there, humorless and with nothing to say. I have been thinking about the way my life is everyday for a very long time now. But i never absolutely commited to changing it, and even when i thought i did, it always ended in a few days at most. I know that we are the creators of our own story. I know that by doing the same thing, i'm not getting anywhere further. The question is, when will i change?
.

I hit the Alt+F4 buttons on my keyboard to end the game a few seconds after these thoughts. I've started making myself something to eat, and giving some serious thought into this whole ordeal. After a few hours of watching self-help videos, i asked myself, what do i really want? What hurts me most is definitely my lack of peace of mind, which leads to my shyness and lack of social contact. That's what i want. I want people to respect me, and like me. I have forgotten how it feels since elementary school. Ever since High, people seemed to just stop liking me, because i developed some limiting beliefs about myself and became a more mature, albeit less likeable person.

I've always HATED with a passion, the word introvert, and got very upset when someone would label me as such. Even worse when i see socially awkward people call themselves introverts. It's not the same fucking thing! Anyway, i have recently started accepting myself as one, even though i hate it and wish i could be different. But after thinking about what i really want, it dawned on me. I can not be an introvert. In elementary, i was considered the class clown, and kids were deciding whether they would go to a field trip or not, according to whether i would go. I loved the positive attention. I would do stunts, make a fool out of myself, etc. As long as it made people laugh. That's what i loved about it the most. Making others laugh. That's what i've been missing all these years. That's what's been bugging me so much. Not only can i no longer make people laugh, but these days, no one even wants to hear what i have to say. And in turn, i subconsciously start withdrawing into myself more and more. Does this make me an introvert? Absolutely not. I do not mind being by myself, i've functioned that way for years. But that feeling i forgot, the feeling when the people love to have me around, is what really makes me happy.

Therefore i have come to a conclusion. I am not an introvert. I am an ambivert. There is still hope. I have to work on my self-esteem, self-confidence, self-image, and revive my long lost social skills. But when i finally do, and go out there into the world, i will be the happiest man in the world to have finally broken through this bad dream of an outcome. Had i not seen that one meme, my life may have turned out completely different. Maybe it's too soon to talk, but i guess i'm about to find out. Wish me luck, because i'm going in the direction of my dream from now on.

If you have gotten all this way, thank you very much, it's an honor for each and every person. If you have any thoughts or advice, feel free to share. Have a great day!",10Sep2019,2
3,"One of my childhood best friends sent me a picture of us from when we were 13-14, which was about 10 years ago. I was totally taken aback from how bad I looked. Then immediately disgusted with myself for caring about how I looked as an innocent kid. Now I’m not exaggerating when I say I looked pretty damn rough, mid length hair with weird spikey bangs and bad makeup with too much eyeliner plus a big nose and giant round boyish face. This was the awkward stage between child and teenager and it hit me full force. 

I hate caring about how I looked in the past. I hate being embarrassed that I was an ugly kid, child me doesn’t deserve that! I just hate that I care about looks at all, and I hate that seeing this picture changed my entire outlook of myself. Today I woke up thinking I was pretty, and now I’m reminded by how I used to look and realizing that your face doesn’t dramatically change just because you’ve gotten older. I really just learned how to apply makeup and got better hair. Now I feel like when I’m just sitting somewhere, people are going to be inspecting my looks and thinking about it to themselves as they watch me. Something about that really upsets me.

I don’t know why this experience is hitting me harder than I want it to. I grew up around people and a society that made me feel like looks were the most important thing, and that they were what you’d most be judged on. Honestly, I get judged a shit ton on how I look even to this day and it feels like nobody is ever talking about me unless it has something to do with my appearance. I’ll hear something talk about how someone else called me ugly, and I’ll hear about how someone else thinks I’m so hot and wants to get to know me. At least if it was one or the other I could reach some kind of closure with how I look to others, but it’s always a mix. I feel like I don’t even know what I look like and hate that my identity is wrapped around physical beauty. 

I want to be beautiful but I don’t want to care. Is there a healthy mix? Is there a way I can take time and effort and money to become the best looking version of myself, while not feeling guilty that I want to look good? I hate that my self esteem is so shot from this, when I really thought that I was a confident person. Do normal people think about this or should I have grown out of this insecurity? Why do people act like nobody notices how you look when in reality they really do, all the time.

Thanks for listening to my rant, if you did. I feel silly but just needed to express how I was feeling.",10Sep2019,2

that is how i am feeling, as if home is a tangible thing that i can reach if i shut my eyes hard enough

15,"So today i bought a brand new phone and instantly i went to a brand new kiosk to buy a strong screen protector and a bulky cover.
 
As soon as i get there i ask for the screen protector and the guy ask for my phone, he takes it and grabs the screen protector that fits and does the process of cleaning the screen then applying the screen protector, cool!

Next i ask for a bulky cover and grabs the phone and looks behind the shelve for a bulky one that fits but finds none so he says ""ill head over to the other kiosk to see if they have one there"" and he leaves with the phone in hand i think of asking for it back but hesitate because i don't want to be rude (which i regret and feel like a pussy for not doing so) so instead i follow him from 5 feet away and he never looks back, all the way to the other kiosk he puts his own phone is his pocket and starts using my phone looking for who knows what just fiddling with it so i'm kinda concerned as to what he was doing although in hindsight i think he was just being curious about the model and what it could do but i'm still worried because i DON'T know what he did.
He gets to the other kiosk and hands over the phone to a colleague there as i look from afar for any shady moves, after a while i decide to just approach and as i get there he seems surprised that i followed him and the phone was already inside the cover as his colleague handed it to me asking if i liked it, i liked it and took it back.

After that i just pay him and leave and i guess he couldn't possibly do anything with a brand new phone with literally nothing installed in it, the only thing it did have was my previous phone number and i don't think he could do anything from knowing that right?

But what really worries me is the sim card, could he had possibly made a copy of it? he did handshake a guy sitting on a bench as he was walking there and as soon as he did that the old guy puts his hand in his pocket and pulls out a handkerchief in a fast manner which idk whether think nothing of it or what... how hard/easy is it to copy a simcard?

Also am i being overly paranoid? i think i might be but it's not everyday someone just takes your phone for a stroll without saying anything like that...",10Sep2019,1

23,"I feel like I have trouble keeping close friends. I had amazing best friends in college, but those fell apart horribly. Since then, I feel like I’ve been trying to find my niche.


We had one friend who always hosted these events for everyone. It was a boon, since he had the most diverse group you could ever see. But then he moved away, and somehow I was able to take that mantle for awhile. However, being connected to everyone but not having anyone feel connected to you is lonely. 


I have been described as the center spoke of a wheel of many friends... which is flattering and I honestly appreciate it. But from my view, everyone is the center of their own friend wheel, and while I am connected I don’t feel like I’m in anyone’s friend wheel. Often times I’m the one who has to reach out or make plans, otherwise I’m going out alone or staying home. I got tired of always planning and initiating so I phased out of it. 


I do have many acquaintances, lots of friends, and a handful of people I would describe as my best friends and they feel the same in return. And I know my strengths- I’m charming, funny, witty and I appear confident to most.  I’m just tired of feeling lonely when logistically I’m not.",10Sep2019,1

As the title says, one year ago I set out to make my first game. And it truly has been a crazy experience, filled with constantly alternating periods of sadness and doubt and excitement and enthusiasm. Along the way, I made an amazing decision, and that was to find some other people who wanted to help make a great game. We're doing our best to release the game before 2020, and I'm truly excited to share it with the world, no matter what the reception may be. I really hope you enjoy Birdie as much as we have enjoyed making it.

Birdie is a 2D pixel-platformer endless flyer game at its core with some RPG elements, other minigames, and tons of love put into it. There's lots of competitive aspects to the game, treasure to find and clothes to collect, characters to interact with and procedurally generated worlds to explore. Birdie is completely free and will be released on Android and iOS.

You can sign up for the beta now on our site, and everyone who signs up gets to play first! It would be super awesome if you did. Just visit [https://www.playbirdie.com](https://www.playbirdie.com). Filling out the form just takes a few seconds.

Also, the main theme for the game was just completed! If you want to listen to it and show our composer some love, that would be amazing!

I’ve tried religion, music, distraction, food, shopping, meditation, exercise, all of it. But I’m at a point now where I really can’t do it anymore. It’s been 10 years since I first started battling depression, 10 years of holding out hope and waiting for things to get better, but they haven’t and honestly I don’t think they ever will. Ever.

For example, I feel confident to a certain degree, but at the same time, I feel like everyone is smarter/better-looking/happier than I am. Like, is it normal to feel this way?

32,"My senior year of high school I started to have a slight crush on my friends girlfriends sister. I was 16M and she was 16F but a junior. My group of friends at the time (who my friend was dating her sister) tried to get me to talk to her more and make myself known, which I did but I had terrible social skills (stuttering,  nervousness, and I got really sweaty) but they kind of helped me build confidence. I had a lot going for me with an academic scholarship, graduating top 30 in a class of 800, and doing a stem major. I felt really confident and achieved and honestly from I can remember was the last time I felt good about myself. Anyway, my friends encouraged me to do things for her I bought her lunch a couple times. She was nice to me but being a naive teenager I didn’t really realize she didn’t like me at all.

Eventually graduate and me and her interact much less although I asked her out a couple times to which she said “Maybe. We’ll see.” But I eventually figure it out to which came from her blocking me one day as per the suggestion of my friend (dating her sister) because I didn’t get the hint. I feel pretty shitty but I move on. 

Now here’s where the truth bomb got unleashed like Hiroshima. This girl despised me.  I found out from my other friend who left our group. Apparently he always wanted to tell me but never did because he didn’t want to cause any problems. But she had been making fun of me for like a year and a half on Twitter. (I don’t use it so I didn’t know). She posted about how she used me for food, called me a looser, said  I was funny thinking I had a chance with her, said I was awkward and a clown. And even now when I’ve seen her at my college she’s given me dirty looks. I’ve never felt so shitty. I mean honestly it gave me a few tears because I felt degraded. I felt like a looser and haven’t felt any different for a while. It’s been about a year since I found out and while I don’t feel as shorty I still have a lack of confidence because every time I look in the mirror I just think about being called a looser with rows of clown emojis. I don’t know what to do. I feel shitty and feel like I’ll always be shitty. It’s taken a toll on me, i haven’t gotten close to people since her and honestly don’t want another crush ever again.

We talked in May and it was fun, she said ""text me"" as her goodbye, but I never did.

We talked again tonight, maybe an hour, at a mutual friends house. And it was great, but there is still something that divides us, but when you talk it's like if you ignore it everything is great. I laughed a lot, she laughed more than I did. 

We hugged goodbye and she again asked me to text her as her goodbye.

I was driving home and I thought of a really funny reference to an old joke and was waiting until I got home to type it up and send it, because I knew she would get a kick out of it.

I had it typed up and.... I thought about all that had happened between us, and all the pain and mixed feelings I had about her.

And I deleted the text. 

I couldn't bring myself to send it, I want her to be happy and OK, but I don't want to be part of it.

Since finally 'getting over us', he's been sending me walls of text telling me we get along and that we should keep hanging out just the two of us and that he definitely just wants to be friends and why have I restricted him on social media platforms and on and on an on. He literally just asked me if I wanted to grab dinner next week and chill out with him............

It's exhausting! And he is wasting his time! I don't want to force a friendship, and after breaking up with him, it would be difficult for both of us to suddenly just go into being besties. We have a lot of mutual friends anyway, so it's not like we are going to start acting completely uncivil toward one another. 

Since the break up I've allowed myself to be 100% firm with him (he is someone who likes things to go his way), and it feels really good simply giving him a firm 'no'. And as someone who has a difficult time saying no to people, it feels really good. NO!!!!!!!!",10Sep2019,11

42,"i found it, the reason i am not confident, the reason i am the bullied one always, the reason i am lazy, it has been like 1 and half hour since my mom yelled at me grabbed my cheek to beat me just because i sneezed 2 times when our neighbours were going to ujjain, i first time felt weird because i haven't been beaten by mom for what like a long time. if i deeply think about it, isn't this what made me tolerant of people's beating, i was always beaten and even at the places i wasn't supposed to be, at places where for her need for having \[a good social image\] she beat the hell out of me. how many times has she yelled at me since i was born for not having a what she think as 'good behavior' in front of others. This fear of having a bad behavior followed me and even though the beating has gone, the scars are too much that it has stopped me from developing to my best self. i am not blaming her for my flaws, no she is doing the best she can in her place regarding how much has she seen and how much it has shaped and affected her personality. she was never good at studies, she worked instead of study at her age. when she was married to my dad who was very abusive at that time, she was beaten more than often, at small things like tea, my dad had beaten her, this pragmatic approach broken her attitude which she had in her mom's house, it gave a pragmatic view to world. when i was 3 or 4, my grand dad passed, it just affected her even more, which lead to giving the beating she was given in dad's house to her kids, \[me and my both sisters\] she got used to working so much that in dad's house that she still does all work of house and my sisters don't. she doesn't let me work because as from what she has seen, men shouldn't work. for speaking anything, she would beat me, which developed a fear of not speaking something which developed a fear of not speaking at all in me. As i read a quote once, we are nothing but the reflection of our family, it sums up everything does. right now she is emotionally broken because my grandma passed away, which is in a fairly young age. i think i understood why i do what i do, i am lazy because she let me and i saw her doing everything my dad said, making me think like she is my maid unconsciously. limiting beliefs, i found their reason now all i have to do is know how to remove them, how can i?",10Sep2019,1
43,"My dad and my mom split up when I was really young and it was mainly due to her being a drug addict and alcoholic. I don't have much memory of her when I was younger, but I still care for her for some reason.



 Later on in life, around middle school I wanted to start seeing my mom again since she was clean. I would visit her (she lived with her parents at 35, I think that's how old she was I'm not sure). So from around 6th-8th grade I would visit her a couple times a year. 


I also have a little sister (my mom had her with another guy and calls her a mistake). She's awesome, a wonderful girl. Nine years old I think.  She got sexually abused a couple years ago and my mom's parenting led to her being put in a foster home. I miss her so much. 


Around a year ago my mom started messaging me on Instagram talking about how the stars are aligning and everything is starting to make sense to her. She says she's getting millions from the government in a couple months and she's moving to another country next June. She was kind of off the rails, but I stayed in contact. She's my mom. 


For a couple months now, no contact. I can't find her on Snapchat, Facebook, or Instagram. Her accounts are still there but nothing is active. One of the last things she told me is that she married this Italian dude who moved here and she has three step-daughters. 


It breaks my heart that me, her first son has no contact with her. That my little half-sister who she calls a mistake is in a foster home. That she's with someone else with three new daughters. I just want to make sure she's okay, that she's not just ghosting me. It's been keeping me up at night and my sleep schedule has been fucked. It's started getting to me lately and I feel lonely. I miss my sister so much, when I get older I'll try to make up for all this lost time. :(",10Sep2019,3

52,"Hey so bear with me for a moment, I've never ever told anyone very much about my life, and so I'm just very curious what my life sounds like to others and just want to hear unfiltered feedback. I am 19, gay, and a dude. Starts out boring so wait, but here it goes:

My early childhood wasn't that significant, however when my younger brother was becoming a toddler things started going south. Around the time he was becoming a toddler I started becoming self aware, as in aware of what was going on around me and conscious and blah blah. My Dad was a pretty warm figure in my early life, I constantly emulated him and wished nothing else but to completely follow in his footsteps, but as I grew and started to be less submissive to parental authority he started to grow violent. And I don't just mean like I was a teenager and fighting back, this stuff manifested a lot when I was about in kindergarten. My Dad is a macho guy who grew up old school and also had abusive parents which affected him considerably (more on that later). A lot of times he thought he was ""disciplining us"" and teaching us how to behave but a lot of times he was just angry. The thing about him disciplining us though is that besides being overtly physical he was often punishing us for things that we were too young to be able to comprehend. The best analogy to explain is that when potty training our puppy he threw our puppy across the room because he peed in our house, our puppy was about 8-12 weeks old when this stuff was happening and it was a common occurrence. And when he punished us it was often excessive and cruel, at least in my mind. He'd spank us with the belt so hard it would leave welts for a days. Sometimes my Mom would even beg my Dad to stop and of course he would refuse. If we flinched or scooted forward we'd get spanked even more because we were being disrespectful by ""avoiding our punishment"". We would often have to be in timeout for what seemed like hours but I have no idea, and if our nose wasn't so far in the timeout corner as he wanted he would either shove our nose in their by whamming our head, extending the time, or whipping us with the belt. I thought this was excessive but want to know others thoughts. 

He'd also just lash out and hit us over trivial things. His favorite move was to grab us by the nape of our neck and slam us to the ground. Or just against stuff in general. One time he slammed my like 5 year old brothers head against a truck. I have always wondered how much of this my mother knew. My mother is emotionally removed, so me or my brother really have no emotional connection to her and she is pretty adept at ignoring problems she doesn't want to handle. She also grew up in an abusive home. But my Dad would often threaten to really hurt us bad if we told my Mom. Or he would hurt us and we would cry and he would say ""oh so if you're gonna cry I can really give you something to cry about"". 

All of this led to severe disillusionment with my Dad and I stopped wanting to be like him. But it turns out that him and my brother have the same interests (Fishing, Hunting, and Football). So my Dad, and then my Mom developed a favorite, my younger brother. They would punish me for not controlling my brother and his insane temper (courtesy of my father's DNA) but then punish me if I ever tried to control him, alternating between ""Your his older brother, control him"" and ""How dare you control him you're not the parent"". He always got better presents and got better things and he has always had the world handed to him. A lot of small scale Cinderella moments would happen where I was expected to do all this stuff for him and was punished for asking him to return the favor. My Dad has a huge temper and a huge narcissistic streak and were always walking on eggshells and had to manage his emotions to ensure there wouldn't be retribution. I have only ever heard him admit to being wrong once my entire life, it was so momentous that I remember it because it stands out so much. Speaking of which, since I gained the ability to remember things I have only really hugged my mom like 4 or 5 times. I would hug her but she wouldn’t hug me back and those 4 or 5 times represent the times she hugged me. Anyways that narcissistic streak led to a lot of fuck ups which he would blame my brother and I for because of the said narcissistic streaks.

He was only physically abusive like once or twice a week so it wasn't bad. I kept growing up and as I grew up the abuse got worse and then kinda calmed down as my Dad tried to work on his anger issues, as the oldest I bore most of the abuse (75-80%). My seventh grade year or so he started being more consistently abusive eventually climaxed into him choking me so bad I started to pass out and did for a few seconds. For like 2 months my Mom made him move into our mother and law suite and be away but he came back eventually. After that it was pretty infrequent, fall of like my sophomore year he slammed me into the wall in my room and multiple pictures fell lol, he went to start hitting me and I shoved him back and he hit the door pretty hard. I yelled at him and said that if he ever tried to hurt me again I would beat him up twice as bad. My Dad said he was bigger than me and so I wouldn't be able to, I said ""I am beyond furious from years of this, you maybe stronger but if you ever lay your hands on me again I will put you on your frickin back with the force of my rage"". I know, I said frickin, pretty lame lol. But it worked and he never laid his hands on me again although quite a few times I thought he would.

That's the physical stuff, and I touched on his anger and how my brother and I would have to learn to handle it, channel it, and learn how to soothe his anger. We had to learn to soothe his anger pretty quick because of how he could be towards service people. He also had a lot of weird fucking rules that are so hard to explain I won't even try. Also he would always give contradictory rules and then we would get punished for obscure rules or rules that didn't exist until we were being punished for them. Everything was very regimented. We had these things called EDDs (EveryDay Drills). It was just psycho like that. We did like three- four hours of chores a day and got no allowance nor did my parents buy us any toys or barely even clothes. The only clothes we got were from my Grandma yearly for back to school. We were also only allowed to have fun once a day wether it was hanging with friends or Tv it could only be once a day.

The emotional stuff however had another side, a side that culminated in an eating disorder and some other things. My Dad definitely has some problems with eating and his weight, his narcissistic streak covers how deeply insecure he is and he never quite got over the fact he used to be a bodybuilder. He grew into a pudgy man though and would often starve himself or go on extreme diets to lose weight. As a kid I often would eat my feelings and I became pudgy myself. He would call me fat and make me exercise because I was fat. When I was like 5 he would make me watch and work out to ""the Wiggles"" for like an hour but then he started making me do sprints and workouts and he would encourage me to eat less. Fast forward to seventh grade and I developed an eating disorder, I have a hard time saying I have and had anorexia because even at my lowest I was never skinny skinny just because my body is built stocky but I was often eating 500 calories a day max seventh grade and lost a shit ton of weight. It comes and goes now and sometimes my doctor grows concerned for my weight loss but I'm never super skinny so he doesn't get too concerned (I have just a stocky body type and it is so annoying). Now my weight journey has swung the other way and after getting fairly skinny I started going to the gym and now I am going 5 days a week and I actually just started using steroids. I spent months going to the gym while eating under a thousand calories each day and my body was just fatigued. I was so weak. The bargain I made with myself was that I could eat but I had to lift seriously and take steroids so I could get muscular. I know that if the gym was like removed from me I would just swing back into not eating.

Also I am gay. My family is Trump conservative and very religious. We went to church every Sunday no matter what, and daily bible study was mandatory, as well as youth group and consuming christian media 50% out of all the media we consumed. Which was little, because TV was limited to an hour a day and one movie on Friday and sometime Saturday. Sunday was no media at all unless it was Christian and even then it was mostly relegated to Veggie Tales before Church. Growing up and realizing my sexuality really fucked with me and I would pray a ton and cry my eyes out begging god not to be gay. 

All of this shit was worsened when I hit puberty, which is when Depression, Anxiety, OCD, and ADD all set in. I was only diagnosed with them the last year of high school once I got my own doctor because of my family's conservative nature but thats when they started appearing. The abuse, the mental illnesses caused by the abuse, my eating problems, and my growingly apparent sexuality made me very suicidal and I dabbled with self harm on and off, two months self harming two months not.

Back to the gay stuff, I got a phone! Which I bought with the money I had saved from working side jobs! My parents made me sign a contract saying the rules and I had to download a purity spyware thing I quickly disabled. I was in eight grade and after I disabled the purity spyware I discovered Grindr and the Craigslist Classified section. I was a popular kid so fooling around with guys at my school was pretty much out and so I turned to Grindr and Craigslist as my sexual outlet. The only guys who would meet with me were the ones who were predators. It was consensual so I don't have too much regrets over it because I thunk it was necessary for me to be able to experiment but I do think they're fucking perverts. I should probably mention my sexual problems here too which are probably Daddy related. I am big into bondage/ Bdsm and being submissive, I like that stuff but I also just like it rough in general. I also am usually attracted to daddy types, but the muscular daddy types because I have a huge fear of fat. I don't know if the daddy attraction is related to my daddy issues though because I am really attracted to muscles primarily and so I would've fooled with someone my age but they didn't have muscles like I liked haha. One day, I had faked going for a run but really I met up with a guy in a public restroom. Someone recognized me and the police later came to my house. The guy was in his thirties and we had a master sub thing going on. The police confiscated my phone and of course told my parents. I should also mention I had a few sugar daddies. Like I said I was into daddies but like oldest I meant was like 40 but I found that old men would be sugar daddies. I always thought it was fucking disgusting but I needed the money because I was too young to work and I also played sports so couldn't really get a job if I was old enough. Yah that all got told to my parents. Not from me though. From my phone via the police. My biggest regret in life is that I didn't wipe that phone, I had the chance to but I didn't think of it because I didn't think they would take it after I confessed to the police that I met up with that guy. God I was so naive. The only reason I didn't go to conversion therapy was because the police made sure I didn't. But my parents made me talk to someone else who had struggled and been cured of homosexuality as well as go to a christian counselor to fix things up and make me straight. I made up this elaborate lie about how this girl I was into had spurned me and I was confused and I had been faking a crush on her for a while and even took her to a dance so ya it worked pretty much and they thought I was back on gods path or something. I got my phone taken away for like 8 months. Not really mad at my parents about this but it just all sucked. I got really depressed and my eating problems got bad. The police asked me about all my suicide, and depression, and eating disorder related searches but I said it was for a friend who I was concerned about and I guess it worked because they didn't ask me again. Other than being hella grounded I wasn't punished too much but the police were kinda suspicious about my parental relationships and were being watchful so makes sense because after everything died down my parents returned back to their shitty ways.

I have never told anyone that last paragraph and fortunately it never went around school which btw was living hell. I was popular yes but also not really. Everyone compared me to the Kardashians, I pretended like my family had money because of smart Goodwill shopping and I always saved up for nice things with money that I got from side jobs but I had good style, was funny, and knew everyone so people loved to talk about me. I knew everyone but didn't have any close friends and it really sucked. Because everyone knew me everyone also liked to gossip about me and my sexuality and just like completely random stuff. I would literally be in the bathrooms and hear students and teachers gossip about me. I was involved in some drama but it wasn't my fault and was generally not a troublemaker it was about such stupid shit I just don't want to say and expose myself over though in case anyone reads it. As my sexuality became apparent even though I was closeted I lost like 95% of my male friendships and got bullied a lot in the locker rooms. My popularity was such a double edged sword it was so hard to explain but hey I was on homecoming court numerous times and got free hoco tickets so I guess it's fine haha.

Other then that stuff I have also been kicked out of my house a couple times by my Dad who resorted to that because he couldn't be abusive. One time he lost it and got out control because when I was vacuuming I didn't vacuum something because I thought he didn't want me to vacuum it and since my Mom was away I was kicked out for like a month, that was junior year. Ya it was fun. In my last year at high school I was lowkey an alcoholic which I decided was gonna be my coping measure instead of cutting which caused me a shit ton of problems after I got caught. I graduated and then went to community college so I was staying at home, poor decision but something I was coerced into doing. I ended up being kicked out by my Dad after an argument over how my dog was being treated. I was gonna have to live elsewhere but I essentially blackmailed my parents into letting me live in our mother and law suite. I couldn't afford to live elsewhere and go to school and because I was over 18 my Mom wouldn't stand up for me anymore. Also I reported some of the abuse and she felt like I was betraying the family and I just needed to forget it. I don't speak to my family nor spend holidays with them and it has been like 8 months since I moved up into the mother and law suite so shoutout to blackmail for allowing me to not have to rent. I fell into a huge depressive slump and already was struggling a lot with eating disorders and I pretty much flunked that term. I'll probably not really speak to my parents again, unless they try to make amends. Not having a family sucks but it's also nice to not be around their toxicity. Anyway nothing is resolved but that is where the story ends for now! 

Obviously it is pretty easy compared to what others have gone through and I feel bad for taking away from but even though other people have had way worse and I should probably be grateful this still has hella fuckin affected me, anyways lemme know your thoughts on my life lol! I don't get offended easy and I am an INFJ so I just like outside input",10Sep2019,3
53,"I realise that I barely understand concepts enough to talk about it in depth now that I’m in my second year and things are getting more intense and complicated. I’m never the type to get good grades, I don’t think I’ve ever gotten good enough grades. It doesn’t help that my sister has a scholarship and is always hard working and smart. I’m thankful that my parents are still willing to pay for my education even though I’m not doing well. Heck, I don’t even dare to tell them my grades. It’s so embarrassing because I feel like I work so hard but my grades are so bad, especially so for this semester. 

Ever since the start of the semester, I feel dumb as ever. My gpa dropped from last semester and I told myself to work harder than ever and I am. I come home everyday and I study. But I still feel extra stupid. We have quizzes and my friends were talking about how much they got. And then my friend asked if I understood. I THOUGHT I understood but obviously according to the results, I didn’t. I’m really trying harder than ever. I feel like this last leg of academics is the hardest I’ve ever tried in my ~ 13-14 years of studying. I’m just thinking of how I won’t even get second class by the end of my 4 years. And I’m thinking about how embarrassed I will be to even invite my parents to my convocation when I have shit results.

I guess the only thing that can comfort me is that I know that I’ve learnt things despite not getting good grades. And if I had the choice, I wouldn’t choose another major. I like my major, just that I don’t think I’m fit for it. It’s really interesting but I don’t think I have the brains for it. I already have a diploma in another related course that will complement my current major and I’m really just looking forward to get a job in about 3 years.

61,"Please let me know if this is the wrong sub for this.

For a couple years now, after constant self-reflection and reassessing my values to determine what kind of person I want to be, I've come to a strange and sort of vague understanding of something. Everyone has their struggles, big and small. But do some/many of us happen to fall in between the cracks of social groups where we are caught in the middle tier of ""I have my issues"" but no one acknowledges them?

I'm not taking about the lowest lows or highest highs of concerns being neglect. I mean the people in the dead center.

For me, I'm in between finding a new place to live. In my mid-20's, single, one full time and one part time job, friend group honestly less than 3-5 people. I exercise regularly, read, write and draw, play video games, and enjoy a good heart-to-heart conversation with most people. 

Where the trouble is I feel is in my needs not being met. I lack gaining affection, romantically, which would mean I should put myself out there more. My jobs are insufficient, so time to look for better work. 

But my interests also are not getting the attention I crave. I'm not expecting major praise for a drawing of a smiley face, of course. All within good reason.

My imagination sees me stuck in that spot in the car, right between the driver's seat and the middle compartment. (Cupholders/arm rest area) I let coworkers/friends vent and share their achievements to me, but I can't do the same back.

And this isn't the start of a pity party for me. I'm just trying to wrap my mind around the state I'm in and what I should do about it, if I can do anything.

Thinking maturely, it seems like one of those ""not now, but later"" situations. But I would also argue that as an adult some of those circumstances require an action. Do something so a thing can happen, otherwise it won't.

My little brother who is almost in his last year of high school is incredibly lazy and pretty much outright refuses to do any of his work, and his grades reflect that. My mother and I have tried everything from tutoring to punishment to rewarding him just to try and get some progress out of him but nothing works. I was the exact same way in high school and I ended up dropping out because it wasn’t the right environment for me which he keeps saying himself, so get where he is coming from. I’m now in university studying to become a teacher (crazy right) so everything has worked out for me in the end. So now I just suggest to him that if he doesn’t put in the effort he should just leave high school and work for a bit until he decides what he wants to do with his life. For some reason he doesn’t want to do that either, but I’m pretty sure by years end it won’t be up to him anymore. 

Is there any advice anyone could give to me to try and combat this situation, I don’t want to see my brother end up lost in life because he didn’t care enough when it counted; I don’t want him to regret anything down the road.

67,"Hello,

I’m 33f. I’ve been with my partner (33m) for 3 years. He has a 7 year old daughter with his ex-wife (31f) of almost 6-years. When we first met I knew he didn’t have an assets or money due to paying for his divorce. I have worked very hard my whole life and managed to save quite a substantial amount that I still view as my money. He is not yet divorced but court was finalized last summer and he was left with $1200 per month to live off of while his ex-wife received $1140 ($340 child support and $800 spousal support).  I actually broke up with him for 1 month after the verdict as I refuse to financially support him and his daughter because his ex-wife refuses to work. He promised me that he would do whatever it takes to make this work and that we would get financial help from his parents as long as needed so I decided to give it another try as I do love him very much and have never connected so well with someone. I am going through a career change so my financial situation is unstable but I do have earning potential with my current education. Although we are financially stable now, I worry about what will happen when we go back to court in summer 2021 (they will have been separated for over 5 years at that point in time). He now makes significantly more money and I worry that all it will mean to the court is that he has the ability to continue to support his useless ex-wife.  I’ve read a lot about family law and divorce law and it seems pretty unpredictable what will happen in 2 years and I feel anxiety around the uncertainty of my financial future about once a week. I also read that I may be responsible to pay child support if our relationship dissolved if we have been living together over 2 years. I also bought a house with a large down payment which is only in my name which we live in. I’m not sure if I’m looking for advice or examples of what happened in similar situations. I would like to find peace of mind so that I can stop feeling like I ruined my financial situation by choosing him as a partner. I’ve considered getting a prenup to protect my assets but I’m not sure about the cost (which I prefer not to spend money on) and procedure.

71,"I don't share this publicly often, but I've wrestled with suicidal thoughts since the age of 12 (I am now 29). I didn't talk to anyone about it until I was in college. All that time in middle school and high school I didn't have words to describe what I was feeling. I still don't always have the words, but now I often use words like sadness, loneliness, and despair. A lot of times I'll say ""I don't feel like being alive anymore."" Not that I want to die, just that everything in this world is so stressful and complicated and dark that I would feel like there is only one way out.

I'm doing quite a bit better now, but I wanted to share my story because there were a lot of days where I didn't feel like there was hope. But I want to encourage you that there is hope for you. You - whoever you are that is struggling with suicidal thoughts - I want you to know there is hope, and I want to fight for you and with you.

I want to share with you that it's ok to feel broken, and to feel depressed. It's normal even. But I hope that you will try to share what you're living through with people around you. Even just one person. When you do that, you give someone a chance to love you. And love is one of the few things in this world that can drive out the darkness.

I want you to know I'm on your team in this fight. If you need someone to talk to, feel free to send me a PM, I'll do my best to get back to you as soon as I can (I'm at work rn). I know I won't be able to understand what you're up against, but I'll be in it with you, pushing back the darkness one word at a time.

I love you. Your life matters. You matter. I want you to stay alive because someone in this world needs the love only you can give.",10Sep2019,20
73,"Think I did this wrong lol but anyway, I’m 21 years old. Graduated high school and went to work that summer, later on I get into the social media marketing world and dabbled in my own business where I grew clients Instagrams. I had roughly 100+ clients at one point and was doing very good so I bailed on college, never wanted to go that route anyway. Fast forward a couple years and business has slowed down quite a bit and I’m only making maybe $2k/month, and only have to put in about a hour a day of work. I need something else in life, sitting at home all day is boring as crap - feel like I’ve hit a brick wall. Torn on what to do, I could go to college and still be able to do Instagram or even the same if I had a 9-5. 

Also, I have roughly $60k saved up at the moment. Don’t know what all you think about my situation/where you’d take it next. I’m more of a physical work kind of guy, workout everyday and always do labor-ish work on the side.",10Sep2019,2
74,"We are taking our  A-Level this year, so as a graduation trip, 4 of us decides to go on an overseas trip and we planned for days. All our itinerary (flights and accommodations) were paid and settled in June. All of us were intending on going a trip together since 2 years back. However, one friend decided to back out. Her reason is that she got accepted to attend a prestigious conference overseas. I know the rest of us should feel happy for her and understand that she got accepted. However, the rest of us felt really disappointed about the situation but especially in her. This is because, she decided to sign up in august which is AFTER we settled everything necessary. Before she got accepted, she kept saying that she is just applying to get an experience with interview setting and that she was not really interested. Then when she passed the interview round and got accepted, she changed her tune saying that she needs this science conference desperately and it is important for her future and blah blah blah. (please note: she received the most opportunities and had many international conferences prior to this and honestly, in my opinion, this conference is not critical for her future since she has many prior awards and conferences before) The three of us felt very disappointed that she was willing to forgo 6 years of friendship just for this conference and were in disbelief about her hypocrisy and change of tone. Yet, at the same time, we know that we should be happy for her. But we felt as though our friendship was taken for granted and could be put aside easily without much consideration and how little it meant to her. (throughout the whole discussion after she got accepted, she kept saying how much it meant to her and how desperately she needs it (though previously she said she didnt) and how we should be happy for her genuinely as a friend, blah blah, BUT she never once try to understand from our perspectives (based on her replies). It kinda dawned on me what kind of person she is and it got me thinking: is our 6 years of friendship since secondary 1 till junior college (IP) that easily discarded away?) U might be thinking, its just one trip and no big deal. The thing is that all of us are moving to different countries, different courses for university. and this could be the first and last trip together as a group. Then u would be wondering why cant we reschedule. the thing is the current itinerary was set based on all of our schedules and note she is only going to get busier next year with scholarship, university applications, and i feel like the situation will repeat again with another reason. I am so frustrated, annoyed and esp disappointed. I dont really want this long friendship to be degraded just because of this, but the person is making it hard by being so selfish and was so defensive about herself to the point she is ruining the friendship. You may take a different view on this and there is nothing much that can be done, but I would like to hear your thoughts still and really just wanted a ranting platform.",10Sep2019,1

77,"I don't even remember it happening as I was very drunk. I don't know who she was or what I said or did. I'm thinking about how I could find her and tell her that I'm sorry for what it was but I'm not sure if that's possible.

I'm also not sure how my relationship to alcohol should continue. I never drink alone, it's always a social activity for me. There were many nights when I was out with friends (or home with friends) drinking that left happy memories and built new friendships. It's just that now I find it difficult to regulate myself when I'm already drunk. There is no point at which I say ""no more, that's enough"". That was, until now, a problem that only affected me (the day after a night out). I don't want to behave like a douchebag and I find it my responsibility to behave decently and not put others down but leave them better than they were. 

This leaves me with the question what to do. My current idea is dropping liquor and only drinking beer when I drink as I find it way easier to moderate that way. If this won't work either I think it might be best to stop drinking alltogether.

80,"TLDR: I’m a young &amp; attractive girl/woman but can’t stop comparing myself to other women which makes me feel like an asshole that I’m acting shallow and hurting myself more by ruining my self esteem and confidence. 

I tend to write a lot but I’m going to attempt to shorten my text this time around. I am a 18 year old attractive female. Attractive is subjective but in societal terms I would be considered attractive. I have long brown hair with natural blonde accents, light brown eyes, clear skin, I’m as thin as a board, perky c-cup boobs that fit my body amazingly, a small yet cute butt, long legs, etc. I use to be extremely ugly and unattractive when I was younger and didn’t grow into my beauty till basically after I graduated. Despite being extremely grateful and caring of the body I very much cherish, I continuously hurt myself by comparing myself to other women I judged and thinking how I need to be better appearance wise. I really like girls they are so pretty and nice and I wish I had some girl friends but they scare me so much. 

I believe I’m mainly just experiencing some extreme internalized self confidence issues. When I see an attractive women I just despise myself for not looking like them and then just try to find something wrong with them so I can tell myself they aren’t perfect or I’m better. I don’t really react much with someone considered unattractive besides maybe being slightly relieved or feeling good about myself. I know this is shallow and I don’t like my brain thinking this way at all. I’ve always been smart and I try to not be an asshole. I was just hoping someone might have some helpful advice for me as I’m trying to grow as a person.",10Sep2019,1
81,"This became a very long (or should I say tall?) wall of text, but I would be thankful if you read the whole thing.

It seems like all I've been doing lately is spew hate and rage against trans people. I constantly think of transgender people, transitioning, dysphoria and things like that. For hours, every day. It's been especially bad now that I've been sick with a cold for two weeks and haven't been able to excercise. I think I'm also having a depressive episode - I have lots of fun things I could do, but even my favourite things can't hold my interest for longer than a few minutes. I only see the negatives in everything and even the smallest flaws or errors in things make me even more irritated than normally. So I have no ways to spend my time, except reading anti-trans things online and sometimes writing hateful things myself.

Since a week or so ago, I've been following a mix of LGBT/trans-friendly and trans-critical subs (I like to try and stay neutral on things). Now it's only trans-critical or openly and blatantly trans hate. It doesn't make me feel better about my body (which I dislike). It doesn't make me feel better about being socially female - my name, belonging to female groups, and things like that which I also dislike. Hating myself only gives me temporary relief. It's impossible to feel an all-consuming passionate rage all the time, and when that rage exhausts itself for some time all my trans thoughts come back. So even self-hate as a way to combat trans thoughts doesn't help very much. I feel a lot better with some friends who know about my gender struggle and are accepting of it and whatever it might lead to.

I'm exhausted. My mind's been taken over. I have trouble concentrating on things other than hate for trans people. I felt better when I identified as trans and considered transitioning at one point! It was scary and tiring, but I didn't feel the same sort of a ""pressure"" in my mind than I do now. I could sometimes relax for a time, accept my thoughts and be in peace for the moment. Now I can't. The OCD-like thoughts are much stronger and much more distressing. 

I wish there was some way to definitely know what's the truth about trans people. The truth about me, too: am I just dysmorphic, mentally ill, delusional fetishist? Or are trans people actually real and am I one of them? I feel like I just don't have the strength to struggle any more. I've been told pretty definitively that if I transition I would be almost commiting a crime against humanity and especially all women. That I would be messing up my body and brain. That I would be giving in to sick desired. Then some people tell me that the things I feel are common in trans people, and that transitioning could help me. But I don't know which group is right. It's hard. I'm a scientist myself, and all the peer-reviewed science backs transitioning. But other people say science is wrong and shouldn't be trusted. It sounds sad, that everything should be corrupted so.

It makes me feel suicidal. Please don't suggest calling a hotline - I'm not in immediate danger. There have been times when I've been talking either on phone or even face-to-face to a nurse, talking of my suicidal thoughts, and nothing I've ever said to them has ever lead to some immediate action. It seems almost ridiculous to me that in some places even vague talk of suicidal ideation can land one in involuntary commitment! That sort of stuff doesn't happen where I live. I would have to be holding a knife to my throat or be threathening someone else in order to be considered an acute case 

I have a therapist I meet weekly but my occupied-with-hate mind makes me resist everything she keeps telling to me. Things line acceptance, mercy to oneself, not pushing too hard, or taking time off to take care of oneself are not a part of my vocabulary. As I hate more on trans people I also hate more on everything else. I become a zealot, there's no room in my mind for humanity at all. My therapist is worried. I'm not - when hate takes over my mind all other emotions and feelings disappear. The rest of time, even now, I just feel nothing. Not even numb or empty, completely nothing. Void. In a way this complete and total apathy and depersonalisation has been what I've been aimng for. I don't feel very distressed, but rationally I know this isn't how a human being is supposed to be like.

I just don't know anymore. I don't know what I should be working towards. I'm not even drifting, I'm not moving at all. I'm not even stuck, just unmoving.

I don't even know why I write this. Probably because I don't want to burden any of my friends with things this deep (not even the really accepting friends). But if even someone reads this whole thing, I think I might like some sort of comment. Any sort. That's if I even have any capacity for liking things anymore - I'm not sure about that. I might be too far gone.",10Sep2019,1

86,"Some stories haunt you. Ten years ago I spent half a year tracking down a child who was kidnapped from the slums in India, sold to a local orphanage and then sold again through an American adoption agency. I was able to track down the kids address through court records in India and then flew to Wisconsin and knocked on his adoptive parents door to tell them about their kid's history.  All the parents in India wanted was to open a line of communication to their biological son. But the parents in America were too scared of losing their son that they refused the offer.  [The story](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/03/meet-parents-dark-side-overseas-adoption/) appeared in Mother Jones and then I updated it again in my book ""[The Red Market](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004FEF6OW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1)"".  But for the most part nothing happened. I couldn't legally contact the child until he was 18.   

Then, this last December, the child: Avi/Subash contacted me and said he had read my article. He wanted to meet his parents. So I helped reconnect him to his family in Chennai.  Two days ago he sent me [this picture](https://twitter.com/sgcarney/status/1171436743611936768?s=20).  I couldn't be happier.

90,"For some backstory, I’m a 17 year old high school student living with my parents in a rather messy household.

About a week ago I was cleaning up around the entertainment center in my living room, and I noticed these really small black bugs crawling near the router. I was grossed out so I just wiped them off with a paper towel and threw them away. Every time I’d come back I’d notice they were back and I also noticed some on a lamp in the living room. I cleaned up what I could, took the lamp outside, and told my mom.

My mom found out the dog treat drawer was infested with them and there were thousands of them dead behind the dresser. I was feeling really stressed from that and could hardly sleep.

Fast forward a few days to Sunday, I went to a party and came home a little out of it. I went to my room and saw a mouse scurrying on my desk and freaked out. I shut the door and slept on my dad’s bed (who’s currently on a business trip). I cleaned the fuck out of my room the next day and I couldn’t find where it came from. Ever since then I haven’t been able to sleep in my room.

So yesterday I was looking around where the bug infestation happened and I noticed there were a few of them left but the bulk of the problem had been solved (my mom had tried her best to get rid of them). I cleaned up the tiny amount left and went to eat.

I reached for a box of tricuits and noticed there were a few of those bugs in the bag. 

This set me off and I freaked out. I cried in my room for house and slammed on my desk. It felt like a panic attack. I’m still not comfortable sleeping in my room and the stress has been building so much I’ve been having suicidal thoughts.

I’ve been living in this messy household my entire life and I’ve always been sickened by how much of a slob my mom is and how my dad allows it. This whole bug thing along with the mouse was the final straw for me and I feel so hopeless. I desperately want to get out of this house and never come back. But I’m worried I’m overreacting and am acting crazy. Every night I check around my dad’s bed for an hour or two looking for evidence of bugs or mice. I’m obsessed that one will crawl on me while I sleep or bite me and I’m having a hard time staying together in school. I feel like I can’t relax anywhere in my house because I’m worried there are bugs or mice around me. I think I’m getting paranoid but I don’t know what to do

93,"I’ve just been so happy in my life and what I’ve accomplished so far this year, may not be a lot, because I know I still got a long way to go but it’s much more compared to what my life used to be like. I used to be in a bad place, and I’ve fought to bring myself here and to want to give myself a better life. I’ve always suffered from anxiety and depression, I was homeless from ages 17 to 19 because I was just tired of getting verbally abused and manipulated by my mom. She treated me differently out of my four siblings growing up and it put so much strain on our relationship. She depended on me and she expected more out of me. I’ve struggled in highschool due to this and never gotten the chance to graduate. I dropped out and commited my life to struggling. I had my guard up a lot because I was always scared of what would happen to me or where I would end up, I wasn’t even a bad kid, I had no addictions or hung out with the wrong people but I felt I was still headed in the wrong direction. I was in an abusive relationship because I was looking for someone to love and take care of me, but I figured out that wasn’t love because who in the right mind would abuse the person they love? I eventually found the courage to leave.

I now live with my current partner and my cat, and we have our own place. I even moved to another city, I had to get myself out of that place because I felt it was no longer serving me. I am now back in school and working towards better opportunities, I want a better job so we can afford a new place. I’m excited. It has also been two years since me and my partner started seeing each other and I am just so grateful to have met him. I thought It would be a good idea to share my gratitude with my sister because my siblings are truly the only people I’m close to these days. And she hits me back with advice that I didn’t even ask for, she then goes on about how I put my relationship before everything and myself which is not true, I knew this was just her acting jealous in a very subtle way because she can’t commit to anything or anyone. She’s much older than me and she still lives at home.

What hurt me was how she brings up how my parents don’t want to help me because all I do is brush them off, when all I do is show every ounce of kindness to them. She acts like im co dependant and meanwhile I set healthy boundaries between me and my partner and I don’t rely on him to be there every second of the day, I trust him. 

For one my parents walked away from us once we were all of age to be on our own, I was already off doing my own thing because isn’t that what regular people do when they turn 18? They move out and fall in love or go to school? My family always perceived me as selfish for doing this. I ask for help ONE time and my mom couldn’t even do it because she would rather help my sister, she would do anything for her drive 9 hours to go pick her up yet she can’t even come get me 4 hours away. This one time I ask for a little help, when im literally struggling and in tears she lies to me and says she can help then never talks to me again, never again will I ever depend on anyone to help me. I chose to walk away from my dad because I knew he was using again and he wasn’t acting very kind to me towards the end, he even stole from my sister and kicked out both of my brothers while they were living with him.

At first I was very hurt but then I realized that I gotta stop worrying and take care of myself, because what am I supposed to do? In the end of the day no one’s tucking me in bed or paying my bills. I don’t mind genuinely cutting off any family members in my life if they don’t support me, it might upset me but no one has no right to make me feel inadequate for everything I’ve done.  Growing up I’ve done nothing but take care of my siblings when my mom was out getting drunk and wouldn’t come home for days, or when she became emotionally unstable. I’ve sacrificed my time just so she can go out and correct her mistakes and get the help she needs. I felt obligated, who else was going to take care of us? I had enough because I realized I wasn’t a happy kid, I remained anxious and worrysome. 

I’ve tried reaching out to my parents but all they do is push me away, so that’s on them. All I’m focused on is becoming an independant and functional human being and not this disfunctional bullcrap that I had to endure my entire life. Honestly though, as long as I’m not hurting anyone I’m not doing anything wrong right. I try so hard not to hurt people or my siblings during my growing process, if I do I will correct myself right away and apologize. I just hate being judged by people who aren’t self aware and can’t fix their own issues first, they’d rather look at other peoples flaws. I just wanna become a dependable person so I can help my siblings get the life we never had. I’m sorry but I feel that I really needed to vent because I’m tired of people thinking they can say whatever they want to me because they know I’m sensitive, yet they have no idea what I’ve been through to get myself here. I am aware of the underlying issues that my childhood has caused me and I’ve considered getting professional help many times, but’s hard to reach out, i still haven’t found that courage to do so. I’m still young and I still struggle, but I wish nothing but strength for those like me, and most importantly myself. Thanks for reading!!",10Sep2019,1
94,"	In relationships, I tend to be pretty cold. I consider infatuation to be a chemical reaction. I’ve suffered the most severe effects of Oxytocin only once, which was an ill-conceived affair in my early twenties in which my strong feelings were entirely unrequited. The ensuing couple of years were spent in the kind of misery that left a pretty strong impression on me. I consider Oxytocin the same way I would consider heroin, something with huge awards for the pleasure centers of the brain but carrying extreme risk. I’m not sure I’m capable of allowing myself those feelings again, but if I’m ever tempted I feel like heroin would be more stable.
	Since that time I’ve dated a lot of people and had years long relationships. I’ve never had those kinds of feelings for anyone else, and I’m comfortable with that. My goal for the short term is to have a good time together or in the long term to be with someone who is trustworthy and dependable. Infatuation plays no part, and if I ever say “I love you” I feel like I’m lying to make them feel good. I’m really saying something like “My life is enhanced since you are in it” rather than anything someone would write a song about. That’s enough for me.
	I’m probably in the wrong culture. I feel like I’m unintentionally abusing people since my definition for companionship is so fundamentally different than the people who I go out with since I am providing a facade which can be appealing but is ultimately empty. When someone tells you that they love you, what’s the polite way of replying, “I will never love you, but I like having you around?” I feel like I would be better off somewhere that marriage is considered a transaction or a duty (which is currently nowhere since I wouldn't want to live anywhere where women are considered property). Or maybe someplace without the expectation of life-long pairings in which children are raised communally. Someplace where I’m not expected to provide something I can’t.
	Maybe people can tell I don’t participate in that classical romance bs, or maybe when their feelings for me wear off they want another fix somehow. My relationships end either by circumstance or when my partner gets tired of me. I think the next time I’m single it’s going to be for a while or at least until I can find someone I can appreciate as a life-partner who agrees that we can both see whoever we want. Maybe I can marry another straight guy who feels like I do and we can both see as many people as we want. In any case I should probably stop allowing my relationships to go on for too long.",10Sep2019,0

97,"I smoked cigarettes in college. I hated myself for doing it, but I did it anyway. I knew it was destroying my lungs. I knew it was the beginning of a horrible, horrible mistake. But I did it anyway, because I needed an outlet for my stress. 

Then I discovered vaping.

I was an adult, old enough to buy all of the products advertised for me. The flavorings appealed to me because they were more enjoyable than cigarettes, and also safer. It may very well have saved me from taking years off my life with cigarettes.

But just as Reefer Madness took over America in the 1930s, so too is Vaping Madness descending upon all of us. I am becoming stigmatized. My choices as a consumer are being sacrificed on the altar of the nanny state. Protests are unanimously given refrains of ""THINK OF THE CHILDREN"", in tones much more shrill and irrational than Helen Lovejoy's. Rights do not matter. All that matters is the all-encompassing altruism of our government, the Nanny.

I will not live in a world where my state government is encouraging me to smoke cigarettes again.

I am not a hardcore fan of Pewdiepie but I can respect him and I am happy that he reached 100 million subscribers. But at the start of the video he does an ad. That video is him showing where he was when he started Youtube and where he is now, and how grateful he is for his fans, but he just plops an ad right on the video. I'm sure he could've promoted honey on a different video. But seriously he has to make the video where he is talking about him reaching 100 million subscribers sponsored?",10Sep2019,1
103,"First day of class and as I enter my classroom at 9:30 AM on a cold Monday one would think the first thing I as a male college student would notice and put my attention to is girls but no. Neither I focused on the periodic table or the projector portraying the grading criteria for the semester. Instead, what grabbed my attention was that thin and fresh new 2019 MacBook Pro.

As I take a seat and look around all those impressive and yet simple pieces of machinery, for a couple of seconds I think about my old but nonetheless perfectly fine 2015 MacBook Air and start to think that it no longer is beautiful enough and start to remember all those few moments when it got slow when trying to browse the web just to justify my consumerist thought process. Not to mention that now I prefer the apple logo on the back of the laptop not to light up as previous versions or the screen not having a metal frame but rather have a black glass frame.

As soon as I go home I start to shop for that new laptop while still trying to convince myself and my girlfriend that I need it. What I really needed was to stop myself from doing something that might not harm dramatically my budget but possibly my mentality and consequently my budget and the quality of my life. Most of our consumerism and sometimes even compulsive behaviors are based on the fact of something new. New meaning improved product that announces the old stuff is not good enough for our needs but somehow the new stuff will provide us with that unique feeling of peace and comfort.

I thought about what triggered my behavior of shopping online and as insignificant as it sounds it holds no less power. I started switching the design features of both 2015 and 2019 versions of the MacBook in my mind; what if the 2015 MacBook's logo on the back didn't have light and instead the 2019 did have light inside the apple logo. I would enter the classroom and start to see all these new 2019 MacBooks with the bright logo while I'd be embarrassed to have the old MacBook that is not capable enough to have a light on the logo.

I'm not claiming there is no improvement on software or certain features, what I'm saying is to give attention to our thoughts and behaviors telling us to buy something primarily because how it looks or how **we** look with it. Not to try to convince ourselves that our old device is not good enough when in reality it works just as good as the new one. There is a line between actual improvement and our compulsion to buy something elegant, between the feeling of comfort and the felling of greed, and finally between focusing on material things rather than experiences.

It took me a long time to warm up to the idea to return to school to get the degree I need for this career, and I am just kicking myself for not doing it sooner.

By no means would I say the healing journey is over though, not even close. I’ve made a lot of progress, but not as much as I’d like and not as quickly as I’d like - too many distractions. The next step is to get off Reddit for awhile. So take care while I’m out /r/self. Your wisdom brought me lessons that keep me grounded every day.

125,I am not diagnosed with ocd but this might relate. I’ve always had crushes on girls and had fantasy’s about girls but recently I haven’t been aroused about anything. I thought this meant I was gay. But I don’t feel that way towards men. I still think oh that girls hot but nothing else comes of it. All this happened pretty much over night and I’m wondering if I’m weird or if I’m gay. I really don’t want to be gay and I don’t think I am I just find it weird that all the sudden my desire for women stopped. I just want to know if I’m not alone and if anyone has been in my situation. Anything is appreciated.,10Sep2019,1

I mean yeah sometimes they say they wish they were guys so they can go out later at night and still feel safe.  But no one wants to be a guy...  just cause... and some days realizing that I am not a guy just feels weird, but other days I feel ok about being a girl. So I thought about it and for know I'd like to think of myself as genderfluid. Not going to lie but this is pretty scary coming from a conservative family and I'm already gay so... I guess its just another thing on the road to self discovery.",10Sep2019,1
128,"I’m 30 years old and I have no clue what I’m here on earth for. I work at a job that I despise, have literally no friends at all and no prospects for a girlfriend. I’m not mad at anyone I’m just disappointed in myself for not having any reason for getting out of bed and going on because that’s what’s expected of me. 

I kind of wish that I could force myself to believe in some form of a god because that’d give me some sort of direction in life. Or maybe it would’ve been better if my ex didn’t miscarry. Then I’d have someone to take care of instead of just barely keeping myself alive for no reason. 

I’m pretty sure there’s something wrong with me. Back when I was seeing a therapist after  he disagreed with me and said that I don’t know who I am. I know who I am, I’m a boring mofo that’s living just to exist. 

At the very least I’m a loser. I’ve dropped out of 1 brick and mortar and 2 online schools because the school work stressed me out. Now I can’t even get into a new school because I don’t own a computer. I have a decent paying (but emotionally draining and demeaning) job. I should be able to but a computer but my debt from too many strip club visits and financial drain from lottery tickets stops me from getting a computer. 
 
I know that I could turn my financial situation around by never going into another strip club and cutting out lottery tickets but I know that that’ll never happen. If I can ever lose my debt I’ll visit strip clubs again because being drunk at one is pretty much the only time that I’m happy. And it feels like spending time buying lottery tickets and fantasying about winning is my only hobby. 

I really am a worthless loser.",10Sep2019,3
129," 

We had been dating for a little over 5 months when she asked to end things about 5 days ago. In her words, she hates herself and was getting in to all kinds of things (working out, sorority, work, etc.) to help her self image. However, with all of that going on she felt like she wasn't making time for us and thus was being unfair to me because she couldn't give me what I wanted because she needed to work on herself.

This was my first really serious adult relationship and this caught me by complete surprise. I knew she was busy and couldn't see me as often with the semester, but I thought things would be fine once the semester calmed down. However, this was clearly not the case. I'm not angry at her or her decisions, as I have been there before and had to have similar talks in the past. The thing is, the night we broke up I had intended to telling her that I loved her. I realized this about a week earlier and I was waiting to tell her when we saw each other next, but after she told me through tears that she thought it was best to end it I couldn't tell her and make everything more complicated.

Loving someone is complicated for me. I have trust issues from my past and I actively refuse to say the word to partners or friends, but things were different with her. Now it feels like that once I finally find someone I feel something with, everything blows up in my face. I get everything is still fresh and after a few weeks or months everything will seem okay, but this feels different from other break ups. Normally, I'll feel down for awhile, but I can see how given time everything will be okay. I don't see how I can go back to looking at someone with romantic sincerity after this. On top of this, we still want to be friends once everything calms down, at least that's what we talked about at the time. I don't want to lose her completely, but what if I can't get over all of this hurt that I feel and I poison the relationship.

I'm posting on a throwaway so my friends who know my reddit do not see, they know I'm dealing with a lot but I don't want to lean on them more than I already have in the past given how busy everyone is. I'm just looking for any advice on how to keep my head above water with all of this. Any amount of advice or kind words would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

tl;dr Ex asked to break up to work on herself, but I love her and cannot see how to move on",10Sep2019,1
130,"I never know when the switch is going to flip on me. I’ve been feeling tense lately, but you learn to live with it, to navigate and you hope to God it will get better on the days you don’t trust that it will. Then someone or something (?) triggers it all and you don’t know which way is up. What a hell of a way to live, or rather, not live. 

It starts in the grocery store, the fucking grocery store, while I’m looking for fish sauce, skimming the ingredient lists to find one without sugar. They all have sugar in them. All the weight of everything else in the world, but I’m stuck on this. You have to be or else everything would get to be too much. 

The fingers on my right hand tap against my left palm like I’m playing the piano on it. Some part of me always needs to be working at dispelling the frenzy of energy rattling around inside of me like loose change in a pocket. It’s loose change and in the nature of loose change I don’t know what to do with it. 

The recipe is one I found in a cookbook that I bought full of a genre of recipes for a lifestyle complicated enough that I do not have the budget or inclination to live my life around it. I’ll make one recipe out of it though. That’s what people do, don’t they?

Someone drops a bottle of something that shatters on the floor and goddammit it hurts, it hurts, and I reel back and cringe into myself, shaking with my palms in front of me, like if I surrender it won’t hurt me. Instantly, I’m angry at myself for the disruption, for the stupidity and the over reaction even if I know deep down it isn’t something I need to punish myself for. I was going to buy something, but I place it on the nearest shelf and walk towards the exit. All of me has gone monotone, but I stop to buy a coke zero out of habit and to normalize everything. The actions are routine to me. Self-checkout and walk to my car. 

When I get to my car I just sort of sit there and scream silently inside of my head until I’m crying for real, out of anger. Sometimes there isn’t even sound, just a silent intensity where I breath out hard and no sound comes from the back of my throat. In between, I sip my coke zero and hold my phone tight, pondering who I can text or call. I always come up with no one. People know. People have an idea. I just can’t say any of this and I don’t know why. Maybe I don’t trust anyone enough to understand this in context or maybe I don’t want to have to explain. I don’t know. But I want someone to read this. I do want that, so I’m typing it up because I’ve got no one to text in my phone and no one I’m going to call, but the thoughts are still here and I might not know who is reading this, but I know someone will read it. That’s what I need for now.

    This is why I’m probably not going to work tomorrow and why I look like an awful fucking employee who doesn’t come in as much as she should. Sometimes the PTSD gets to be too much, but I don’t have the option of explaining it all so people get to think what they want. It makes me sad. It makes me fucking sad. I want to have a life without these interruptions. So coworkers, I really hope one of you reddits and maybe gets it without me having to say so.",10Sep2019,1
