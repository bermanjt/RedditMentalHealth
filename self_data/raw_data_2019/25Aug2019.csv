0,"I moved an hour or so away from the area I grew up. I barely talk to my immediate family and never communicate with my friends anymore. I've found a new life. I recently started seeing someone and they are literally my better half.. I've done the whole codependency thing and this is very healthy. 

My mother has no idea.. I don't want to tell her. She's a cynical person and doesn't believe in going head over heels. I have an awful roommate situation and they ate extremely religious, inconsiderate, and gross about their living startards. We are friend different countries. 

Anyway, I was invited by my boyfriends mother to stay with them. They are very laid back humans and I honestly believe they know I love their son with all my heart. I'm moving in next week and we're saving for our own place. 

Did I mention I'm in love with his man!? Also, his mother is a successful attorney and my career path is to be an attorney. She's been very informative and is willing to mentor be through school. I am so happy I found supportive people in my life. 

I don't want my family to know or put any doubt in my mind.. I've lived with doubt forever and I've never been so sure about these humans being a positive and long-term part of my life. I am grateful and I feel so loved by this family. Nothing I've felt with my own.",25Aug2019,2
1,"I never really cared about anyone, but myself in the last 18 years. Yes, I do have parents and a brother, but I don't really care for them on an emotional level.

I don't really talk with my brother at all. Is that weird? I think it is. But why? Why am i like this? My brother is failing and I'm just sitting here being selfish and isolated.

It's too late now anyway, it's been 14 years since my brother is alive and I still haven't formed a deeper relationship with him. I don't feel home here. I just hang out with people, who are supposedly my parents.

They gave birth to me, they feed me food and pay for my things. is this really parenting? I haven't really shared much of my personality with my parents, I kinda keep it for myself. They would just call me weird anyways and of course I would have to explain everything I do, which would be awkward-

How selfish of me. Come to think of it I never really opened up to anyone, no one knows me in a deeper level. I never really liked having conversations and living by ""society's standards?"" 

Yes, I'm an introvert and yes it is an understatement for the situation that I'm dealing with right now. But is it too late now? I'm going to college and i haven't formed any meaningful relationships with my family or anyone else. Fuck, I just lost 18 years of my life, implying I wouldn't waste more time being socially inept, retarded.

I get very anxious about a lot of things, things that I don't know for certain, obviously, so I never really leave my room. Thank god for modern technology for being there and providing cheap entertainment, dopamine rush, keeping my empty time filled with content.

This life isn't really that bad though, maybe I'm exaggerating. I mean I can't complain. I'm white, middle class, no family abuse, Ok tier education, then why did I turn out broken like this? is it my parents or is it me?

My parents spoiled me all throughout my childhood and I just took everything they gave me silently like the spoiled little brat I am. Maybe I should have been more thankful and open, charitable. Well it was difficult to stay charitable when people wouldn't leave me alone, I just wanted some time alone. It's something I value. 

(something I'd like to add here is that my dad never brought home or talked to me about his friends, so that lessened the importance of a friend in my head when I was younger. The idea of a friend never really came into my mind when I was young, I used to come home, do my thing. Ignorance was a bliss back then)

They hated me, because I was quiet, they justified it by saying it's for my sake, they wanted me to grow as a person. Look what came out of that. Nothing. Nothing has changed since then. My days are still often silent. I hear more audio than life. I type more words, than I speak. I'm a slave to the modern technology.

I can never find friendship and a big reason why I can't is because even I'm not friends with myself. How can I expect people to like me, if even I can't be content with myself.

I'm not interesting. I wouldn't have a topic that I could talk about for more than five minutes. I have missed out on essential pop culture references, movies, songs, games, books, people. I lack knowledge, experiences, people in my life and therefore I'm at a serious disadvantage when meeting new people, making friends.  The awkward silence that comes with me trying to *conversate* is, honestly one of the scariest things that I can think of, especially on one on one conversations. 

I lost my trust when I was little. I though we were all laughing along and not at me. Today's connected world doesn't help my thoughts. It has never been easier to talk behind someone's back. Technology was a mistake. (and a blessing of course.)

So, what can I do in this situation? I tried... and i failed. I was making changes, didn't really work though. I stopped. Those changes weren't enough for my odd situation. Perhaps the problem with my attempts at changing my behavior is that I never really changed my behavior. I would eat better alone. I would exercise alone and at home, not at a gym. I would watch some movie alone, never bothered to invite anyone.

And now It's too late, It's the end of summer, another one wasted. Another opportunity ruined by guilt and fear. 3 months of nothing. 3 months of nothing but hopes and dreams. Isn't that HILARIOUS? I'm like sitting here 2AM on a Sunday night writing this to... I don't even know, man. 

I feel weird.",25Aug2019,1

5,"Thought i was going to marry him one day. We’re both 27, been together for 2 years. We were living together, everything was going great up until 2-3 months ago. He became distant... ignored me.. never wanted to hear what I️ had to say about anything. Began making plans often without including me. Was solely just cold towards me. But took care of me financially all summer while i was in school full time finishing up my degree. His dad passed away 3 years ago, and yesterday he finally admitted that he’s depressed, he broke down bawling his eyes out. I cried with him. He feels guilty for the way his dad has passed. He was on life support, and the Mom chose to let him go because of the possibility of being in a vegetable-state after waking up from coma. My ex didn’t want this, he watched his father fight for his life while being let go (pulling the plug). Since then, he thinks about it every single day of his life and it kills him inside. He said the last few months have affected him more lately than ever before, which is why he’s so distant from me, he says. There’s so much to this... im at a loss. I AM lost. Heartbroken. I feel like he took my heart out of my chest and put it on fire. Im homeless. I have nothing. I was ready for the nursing program. But now, that is impossible with no where to live, and having to work full time to try to bounce back one day. I feel hopeless. Just wish my relationship could go back to the way it was. He showed me what life is and taught me so much. He felt like my family, my soul mate. He was my everything. And now, im purely nothing to him.",25Aug2019,2

8,"I am using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

For about a year or so, my life has gotten progressively worse. My grades dropped, my relationship with my parents has gone to shit, I don't feel joy where I once did, and I can't help but wallow and think about how my life isn't worth living.

It's not even like I have any actual friends either, I just know people and they know I exist, but I might aswell be dead, because they would never know, or care to find out. 

The only one I talked to dismissed my feelings and just thinks I'm joking like I always am.

I'm stuck, I want to die, but I am too much of a pussy to do it, at some point, the only reason that i found not to do it is that my parents would think I am an attention whore. Also they might find out by going through my pc that I'm bisexual which would haunt even in death (my parents are EXTREMELY religious).

It's to the point where if I could pay someone to kill me, I would do it.

I've considered therapy, but I could never hope to trust my parents that way and talk to them about my feelings and why I believe I should seek professional help (they'd tell me to read the quran or some shit, find the way of god).

At this point, I'm just rambling but that's that. Also fun fact, I've been offered help before on reddit on an other account, but my anxiety and social ineptitude took control and I blocked them for some reason.",25Aug2019,0

Now five hours have passed and it still hurts like a motherfucker but I am dry of tears.

14,"Hey everyone,

I'm working on a social group platform, designed to help users discover people who have similar interests and experiences, and to see what's going on around you. This way they can meet up in real life and coordinate social interactions. You can think of it as similar Meetup but free, more secure, wide demographic, and many other features. It will be free to use, unlike Meetup.

Features a live map with events and people, a securely encrypted chat, and a discovery feed to meet new people.

For instance, let's say you moved to a new city for work, you don't know anyone there, and are looking to meet people and find fun things to do. You fire up the app and connect with people who have interests in common, and events curated to you.

Or, let's say you want to find something to do tonight, you open the app and see what events are happening -- curated to your specific interests. You can also post your own events and have people join you.

This is perfect for a sub like this, where the whole point is to be more social. The purpose of the app is **to create a great social environment through meaningful real-life interactions**.

I just finished the design stage, next is the development phase (app needs to be programmed). Wanted to see if this is something people would be interested in using before I build it.

If this is a project you're interested in, definitely sign up to the mailing list on the website to stay updated. I'm not here to shill or to ask for money, however any type help would be appreciated; donations, feedback, suggestions, or if you have a skill that might come in handy.

15,"I’m a Chinese-American and yes, I just want to preface:

I do know that most of the time, the negative comments and press are centered around the mainland Chinese government. Especially with the news and stuff that’s going on in Hong Kong, I don’t take it personally, because 

a) I’ve have been speaking out against the CCP even before these protests.
b) I know that’s exactly what the CCP wants- for mainlanders to take it personally. 

On the other hand, there have been a lot of Chinese overseas, usually first generation immigrants and international students I’ve noticed, that are literally waving their pro-CCP flags in the streets of Western countries like Australia, the USA, Ireland, the UK, etc. 

And under all those posts there are comments with like 500 upvotes saying “Chinese people are *insert negative adjective here*, and “send them all back!” On Youtube I’m constantly seeing comments under those Chinese tourists videos with over 1k upvotes saying “they’re all locusts”. Which leaves a bad feeling in my stomach, because I sympathize with where their anger comes from, but their words are so monolithic. 

Of course those Chinese tourists shitting on the ground are disgusting, and I don’t want to associate with them. But also I can’t deny that my parents are from mainland China, nor do I want to. I don’t actually HATE my Chinese heritage, despite all this I’ve been typing. I just hate what the image of Chinese people have become. And part of me is a bit selfish and sad I guess....I don’t want my reputation to be impacted by it even in a subconscious way.

But it’s impossible, because I will always be seen as just another Chinese person on the outside. Even if my values don’t align at ALL with China. 

And with all these embarrassing Chinese tourists, all this political chaos, so many people are lumping everyone all together.

I feel really pathetic typing this out so please no insults. This is just what’s honestly been stuck in my mind all day lately, probably because I’ve been spending way too much time on the Internet lately. 

TL;DR: I don’t want to hate myself and I honestly don’t? But it’s getting hard to flaunt my heritage loud and proud without being afraid of being stereotyped as so and so.",25Aug2019,3

18,"So I'm 20 years old, about to start my third year of college. I didn't have a horrible childhood, we were well provided for, but a little over protected. I wasn't allowed my first boyfriend until college, I didn't get a phone that wasn't a tracfone until I started paying for it( yes, I know both aren't super unreasonable, but it was different for many of my friends)  

The last 3 years of my life, I've been struggling with an eating disorder. I lost about 60 pounds in high school. I've been going back and forth an additional 10 pounds. I was going to get inpatient treatment, then got scared and ran away. I've been trying medication, but the dosage wasn't handled correctly. I was hospitalized a month ago for a suicide attempt, and after a really bad week of my depression and anxiety, I was dumped by my boyfriend. 

Right now, i am trying to move onto campus. When I graduated high school, my parents told me where I was going to school, that I was staying home. and that was final. Things have been totally difficult for my sister, an aspiring music major. I'm chomping at the bit to get out of here, my entire life has seemed a clusterfuck. 

I don't know the point of this. I'm trying my best to get my life on track.  I'm desperately missing my ex. The loneliness drove me to hook up with a friend yesterday( he didn't seem so excited during it), which is something I've never done. Right now, I just wish something would go right.",25Aug2019,2
19,"My old childhood friend is painfully immature still despite all these years we haven't seen each other and it hurts me that we fight over every simple thing because she's always on the defensive.

20,"Sorry, but I feel the need to put down some context. My entire life my parents weren't together. I remember going back and forth between parents as a kid but not I can't really remember much, and then me and my father moved to Florida (We lived in Pennsylvania) out of nowhere one day. 

My father apparently was madly madly in love with my mother, and it's hard to tell when you're a kid but I get the impression now that he isn't, and never really was, a great guy. My mother went on to have 2 other kids, with two other fathers, and all of them for one reason or another were left by the wayside. I know that sounds bad to some people, but I'm more of a ""such is life"" kind of person. Anyways, she never ever looked back, and she worked hard to support her kids.  She loved to read, she encouraged all of her children to explore the arts, urged us to write, draw, paint, pick up an instrument, go hiking and camping. Sorry if I'm rambling, I don't really talk about her much. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well Like I said I moved with my dad to Florida, and I didn't know it at the time but I guess my uncle was abusive as hell. I really hated it at his place, And looking back I get how it's abuse now but I just saw it as discipline and pretty much blamed myself. Don't really want to get into details there. Well, dad one day got the whole picture of what went on while he was at work and we moved to our own little place out in the middle of nowhere. Now, this was my fathers method. 

Here are some things, play with them. He got me video games, toys, a dirt bike (we had a decent plot of land) and honestly most of what a kid could want, but I was socially worthless. I didn't know ANYTHING about society, my uncle is actually the one who forced me to read books, thank god for that because I couldn't live without books. Anyways, dad was the ""Do better in school or I'll hit you"" kind of dad, which is fine I guess but I 100% had (have?) ADD (or is it ADHD?) and he didn't want to hear it. My hygiene was terrible, I didn't know how to talk to people correctly, and I had an inherent fear of authority figures. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Sorry I know I'm rambling but it's hard to fully contextualize how I feel about this without knowing how I feel about these two people because the decision I'm stuck with is really hard for me.** 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother was always great,  and my dad was great for other reasons. He wasn't abusive honestly, and any bullshit stopped when he got home. He's also ridiculously tough. He once broke a rib lifting a 600lb cable at work and this son of a bitch shifted it to the other shoulder, finished his work, and came home on his lunch to wrap his chest in ace bandages before going back. He was Strong and funny and provided for me, but he wasn't good at... idk, tending to my soul. I saw my mother on my summer breaks, and that was obviously amazing, I wish it had been more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, throughout my life my dad was infatuated with my mother. He begged her to take him back hundreds of times, he accidentally called other women her name. I think he truly was mad with love. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 16 my mother moved back in with my dad, both of their current partners being absolutely no good. For the first time ever in my life my family was together, even my siblings where there. I thought everything was great, we went camping together and went to amusement parks and stuff. But, I vividly remember one night where my mother was up in the living room just crying. Her brother just died not too long before so I assumed it was because of that, but she started talking about my dad. ""You don't see it because he's your dad"" ""He's horrible"" I recall arguing with her because she was going to go back to her last partner, who I especially didn't like. I still regret that honestly, but I digress. I foreshadowed enough,before I turned 18 she was dead; cancer. It all happened pretty fast and it effectively destroyed my family, my siblings weren't about to stay with my dad after all. 

Side note: After my mom died but before everyone split up my aunt bought a storage unit my mother had left a ton of her stuff in, back in Pennsylvania. The torn fragments of my immediate family went and picked it all up, and I got one of those Baby Diary things, where parents log everything their baby did and write notes and stuff. Fuck me but was that a hard read, but it abruptly cut off with a big tear stained paragraph about how my mother hates my dad for making her sign custody papers and how she regrets it more than anything and that she's worried about how my life will go. Oof. 

\*ahem\* 

Well it hit my dad the hardest, my mom dying, and I try to see it his way sometimes. You know? The love of his life back for a year and then taken away in the cruelest way possible. Well he started bring home women, any woman that would have him. He once tried to save a girl from the streets, some heroin addict with a tragic story all too common these days. He was always punctual, he was a working man, always, but now he stayed out late into the night, came and left at odd hours. At some point he got pulled over with cocaine, and lost his job, and we lost our house.  He used to talk about suicide and life insurance payouts for me and other stuff that started plenty of fights, he's not perfect but he's still my goddamn father you know. 

My mother was cremated, and he expressed, many many times, that he wants his ashes mixed with hers after he dies. He said that back in those times, I was born in 1990 so the math isn't too hard. But he's 64/65 now, and blew out his back at work. I'm not saying he's going to die any time soon, he's as tough as an Ox, but It has me thinking. Because I KNOW my mother would not want my fathers ashes mixed with hers, and my father wants nothing more to have them mixed. Even mixing just a little of my mothers ashes with his sounds insulting to her, because right before the end I and only I know that she was painfully eager to leave, that my father isn't a great person. But he is my father, and for better or worse he raised me, and I know I'm painting him like a villain here but he's just a guy with a heart of gold and a lot of flaws. But I don't know if I can grant his wish, but it is NOT easy for me to deny it either. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, thank you for humoring me, if anyone did. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR**

My dad wants his ashes mixed with my mother after he dies (she's already dead and cremated) but she didn't really like him and I know she wouldn't like that and my heart hurts.

i feel lonely, and i don't feel like it's going to get any better any time soon. i'm constantly trying to hide my face, or trying not to cry, and it's even worse when people notice and ask about it. constantly comparing myself to everyone else who are cute and confident, even though i know i shouldn't.  

i'm unmotivated to do any homework or classwork, and it's been a week since class even started. i'm already feeling extremely overwhelmed and i'm even afraid to check my grades so i haven't done it yet. 

constantly tired, constantly worrying about my health, like a total hypochondriac.  constantly wishing i could look better or feel better about myself.. i wish i could get a nose job. or get my teeth whitened. or both. or maybe just get an entirely new face. that would be nice.

26,Saw him today for the first time since summer break and he dropped that bomb into the convo.

27,"TL;DR: Dad has cancer, brother flunked out of school, I’m starting senior year completely overwhelmed and I need to vent a little.

So basically, a lot of stuff is going on all at once and I’m so unhappy but there’s nothing I can do about it.

In February my dad was diagnosed with cancer (again). He’s done with chemo and everything and he’s having surgery on Tuesday. He won’t be able to sit up straight for eight weeks. He’s going to be fine and everything, but I know he’s dealing with a whole lot more than I am right now, and it’s not really right to complain about my problems while he’s going through this. I feel awful for him, and I’m trying my hardest not to bother him with anything.

In May, my brother flunked our of college. It was inevitable, but we all pretended that it wouldn’t happen. He has autism and is socially delayed and I cannot stand him. Basically because, our whole childhood he was rude all the time to me and got away with it because of his autism, and he got most of our parents’ attention, even though he screwed up all of the time and I didn’t. I guess I have a lot of resentment about that. I’m honestly not really very nice to him, and everyone always feels the need to remind me of that, but it’s really hard to be nice to someone who was awful to me my whole childhood (although unintentionally). He desperate for me to like him, but I just can’t, and my parents make me feel bad about it all of the time. He hasn’t bothered to get a job or actually do anything this summer, so he’s going crazy being home all of the time. My parents want to send him to a school for people with disabilities, but he won’t be able to go until October. (My mom promised he wouldn’t be here for any part of my senior year, and while I know that it’s not her fault, I’m upset that she went back on her promise.)

In July, my best friend severed ties with me, with very little explanation. She texted me that we couldn’t be friends anymore, and I asked her why, and she left me on read. She’d been my best friend since sixth grade.

On Monday, I start my senior year of high school and I am fucking terrified. I’m still working on the whole applying to college thing, and while I’m normally pretty independent (growing up with a dependent brother helped a lot with that), it’s pretty fucking overwhelming. 

So yeah, right now I’m in bed, freaking out because I don’t know where to go with everything that’s going on. I don’t want to bother my parents because I love them and they’re going through a lot, and I have plenty of close friends but I don’t want to dump things on them either. So I’m venting on reddit.",25Aug2019,2
28,"I really didn’t think he would since he just got hired at his place. I said it would be cool if he worked here and he should look into a position. He actually applied.

30,"Hey guys ! First post here and I've been wanting to say this for a long time. Throughout the last year, I've realized how life doesn't slow down.

Recently, I've become bored with the life I live. Social media has become like a never ending chore, switching from one to another as if I'm running in some race. I've stopped enjoying video games as they feel more of a waste of time. Even going out with my friends has become a burden in which I fake a lot of my reactions.

I think I've become fatigued with the fast tempo of the world and the high expectations placed by my society (university majors and the pressures of opening my business in the future).

So I've decided to take a step back, disable most of my social media and relax. I maintain some communication with my friends but less than my normal activity. I've dedicated my time to hanging out with my family and listening to the music that I enjoy.

Most people my age are drawn to aspire greater goals. However, I just find a place to stay and a stable job as enough to satisfy me. 

I'd rather slow down and enjoy the finer things in life(minimalistic approach) than run this marathon.

What do u think? What advice would you give me and how would you approach this situation?

Thank you for your feedback and enjoy your day!",25Aug2019,9

I heard my ex’s name for the first time in a while earlier and it kind of set me back a bit. Now that I’m trying to sleep I can’t stop thinking about all the bullshit. All the pain. All the shit she put me through. And then turning around and trying to blame me for everything. All the things I should have never done. All the things that would never have happened if I wasn’t so blind. All the things that never would have happened if I would have put my foot down instead of letting myself be manipulated. 

I’ve turned to focusing on other things to get me by. Like work. Like games. Like sleep. Not doing much else other than those things but it’s worked for me. 

I’ve also started trying guided meditation to sleep. It’s been working. I’ve gotten more sleep, better sleep. I don’t wake up as much after listening to the meditations. I sleep a lot better and wake up feeling more rested. It’s nice. 

I’m hoping by just simply putting some of these thoughts down that it’ll help clear my mind and get things away. I would like to just forget about her entirely but then I can’t learn from my mistakes. I wouldn’t know that I need to respect myself more than I did. I wouldn’t know how it feels to let someone walk all over me and tell myself that I would make damn sure it’ll never happen again.

33,"Hi I’m 21 and I just can’t seem to have long conversations w people without stuttering, not knowing what to say, muttering in a low voice, not being able to look at peoples eyes. It’s worse when I try to talk to guys - from a little age I never really hung out with guys and I just find it so hard to talk to them. I always don’t know what to say and feel like anything I say isn’t right for the convo? I also feel like I’m so boring that I can’t keep the conversation going. It’s been really bad lately as it’s triggering a sort of social anxiety with people, including girls as well. I would ask the most boring questions and our convo would just die down in like a minute.

34,"I recently discovered that I am not a crier. And I don't say that to sound badass or anything. In fact, its the opposite. We need to have an emotional release from time to time. I've never truly understood why people cry when they've received emotionally jarring news or are sad/depressed. I get that its a human reaction, and its perfectly normal and natural. But, my first instinct isn't to sit there and cry. Albeit, I have other recognizable symptoms, and do cry from time to time (more of a light sob but thats crying to me I suppose), which I have to force in order to feel a more ""tangible"" form of emotional release. I don't know if there is a scientific name for the thing im about to attempt to explain, but I discovered that my brain and body's way of crying is that I experience full body goosebumps. Goosebumps and all, I then go through about a minute or two of deep processing of whatever emotionally shocking news I've received or what I've gone through. Sometimes it happens when im listening to a very emotional song and I can feel emotion the song is trying to convey all at once.

36," 

I'm a 22 year old male, and I'm from a relatively small city in central Florida, and I'm basically super conflicted and I have no idea where I can start with this, but be prepared for a long-ish post.

So I've been out of school for over a year and a half now, graduated with my Associate's Degree (in a non-declared major, for reasons explained later) from our local community college in May 2018. I told myself near the end of my time there that I would not go back to school because I felt like it was a waste of time. Originally I actually did declare my major, which was Computer Science. However in my second semester there, I failed Calculus. Calculus I, II, and III are required for a CS degree. So I ended up dropping the major, because Calculus was so horrendously terrible it honestly made me cry, made me realize that if I couldn't pass it then there's no hope for me. I never sought out tutoring because I have very bad social anxiety so going to get help from people would just about be not able to happen for me.

While I was finishing my Associate's I did select a couple coding courses just for the hell of it. The first was an introduction to programming, which taught stuff like for loops, variables, all that stuff in Python. Then I took Java programming which introduced me to OOP concepts and more advanced stuff than what was in the previous course. I really enjoyed those classes and I tried to program stuff outside of class...but I didn't realize how much more knowledge it took. Every tutorial I looked up confused, bewildered, and blew my mind. One time I followed a tutorial exactly and to a T and I couldn't figure it out.

I haven't touched computer code for almost a year now, I always feel bad about myself for giving up on something that I enjoyed doing because it was difficult, but I just can't learn this shit on my own.

So I decided to register for University. The closest one that would accept my GPA was UCF (University of Central Florida). I signed up, went to the orientation, and I had a mental breakdown. The environment there just felt like it was smothering me, and I had all these flooding thoughts of moving so far away from my family, girlfriend, and three friends to go to a place where I know nobody. Not to mention I was terrified of having to face these difficult subjects again, given my history of wanting to commit harm to myself so I figured being so alone would be terrible for me. So with that as well as some other logistics issues like not being able to find a place to live and/or a job, I ended up rescinding my application. This was back in November

So I'm here, completely bummed out knowing that I'll never get a career in computer code because I'm too terrified of finishing my bachelor's degree. I've tried teaching it myself, but I just don't have the discipline or the mental strength.

So yeah, that's that. Wtf should I do",25Aug2019,1

40,"I googled my last name, which is rare (only 200 people have it). I know my paternal grandpa is descended from Ukrainian migrants to the Canadian countryside, so I googled it and found an article in an English-written Ukrainian newspaper from 82 years ago. It basically describes a guy with my last name who was the son of the richest farmer of ""the colony."" He apparently had a big mustache and killed a bear with an axe (can't make this up). The story in the paper is that he kept on hitting on a 17 year old girl, then gave her a pumpkin (why?) as a marriage proposal, which she denied, which then brought shame onto the My Last Name tribe. But the plot thickens, he was proudly a member of an obscure ethnic group called the Hutzuls/Hutsuls, who is/was a semi-nomadic group of people in the Carpathian mountains who number roughly 25k as of 2001. They even had a short-lived country and fought a battle. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutsul\_Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutsul_Republic) Now this raises so many questions, because only about 50 people with my last name stayed in Ukraine instead of immigrating to Canada. Is my tribe still active? Roaming the mountains and giving pumpkins to 17 year old girls? What the hell is the colony and is my family still the richest people there?

41,"So, I (20M) have had a serious crush on this girl (20F) I’ve known since high school. (I apologize for my shitty storytelling skills) I myself was more of the artsy kid in high school, she was a year younger than me but she was the same type of girl. The only differences between us were I was more into partying, weed and stupid shit in high school, and she was more into her art, games, and overall just a better person than I was/am. She’s so sweet, smart, funny, cute, just so many things about her made me so happy. In high school we never talked a lot but we were decently good friends. 

Early on in high school, probably around sophomore year I had tried to make this girl my girlfriend. However she had been talking to another guy at the same time and ended up dating him. So we stopped talking for a few months, but eventually she ended up texting me again and we became good friends through school. 

Senior year we had been talking a bit more often, and we had even hung out a couple of times by ourselves (she was still dating the bf at the time), but nothing ever happened. During this year I had managed to find a different girl myself, and she actually liked me a lot. I had trouble talking to girls in high school because of anxiety and being rejected so many times. So things with the girl start looking good, and I still had a crush on the girl from sophomore year, but I didn’t figure anything would ever come of that. So graduation comes around, and me and the crush hang out again. It was probably my best memory from high school, we just ate together and hung out, and she was being really touchy/feely, &amp; she also told me she had wondered if she had made the wrong choice dating her bf. Anyway, next day we hang out, we kiss, get to 3rd base, etc. We told our SO’s that it was only a kiss, and we kinda stopped talking after that. 

So FF to now, (several years afterward) and she’s visiting a mutual friend from high school at a buddy’s house in college, (she lives about 8 hrs or so from hometown) and I see her and all these feelings get brought back up, I miss her again, and although it probably means nothing, she’s looking me directly in the eyes from across the table with all of the homies, doing little flirty type stuff like making funny faces, sticking her tongue out at me, teasing, general stuff.
It’s so amazing to see her again but it’s kinda disappointing at the same time.

Anyway, I know not to expect anything at all, I just wanted to share my feelings with you guys, I don’t have a lot of friends and although this is a condensed version of events, it still helps to talk. I really really miss her and she doesn’t want to talk to me that much, and she lives far away, so it’s just one of those things that life throws at you. It sucks but it happens.

It makes me wonder...what are the things I could say that would actually be vulnerable?

But the other night he told me he slept all day and ended up going to work at 9pm, which isn't totally absurd for Uber but something in his voice made me believe he was lying. I went to bed and tried not to overthink it. 

When he came home, I saw him hanging up his leather jacket in the closet which he wears when he goes out somewhere. I just told him that if he wants to go out and relax, he doesn't need to lie to me about it, he can just be honest. He insisted he didn't go out anywhere, but I knew it wasn't true. 

I looked on his instagram from my main account and didn't see a story posted. However, when I logged into my old account I don't really use anymore, I saw he posted something at a bar/restaurant that was taken while the sun was still up. So, he wasn't home sleeping... he DID go out, lied to me about it, then hid the story from my main account. 

The next day, I called him to let him know the pair of pants he needed had to be ordered online. Totally normal conversation, how's work, all that. Then I brought up the lie. I calmly asked him why he felt the need to lie to me last night, that I saw the story and knew he tried to hide it from me. I explained I'm wasn't  mad that he went out, I was mad that he felt like he needed to lie to me about it and hide it from me. I didn't even finish getting my words out and he hung up on me. Blocked my calls and ignored all my messages for the rest of the night.

Needless to say, I'm extremely angry and confused. He came home last night and crawled into bed without saying anything.

65,"I  bought a guitar a year ago from a local guitar shop as my birthday gift. It was around $100, so nothing too expensive. My mother hired a guitar teacher to teach on the weekends, and though I was enjoying it for the first weeks, it slowly became kinda boring. I didn't realize, but this was because he was teaching me the fundamentals of guitar, (changing chords quickly, finger plucking, slides, etc.) It took so long because I would rarely practice on my own. Finally, he started teaching me Hotel California, my first ""real"" song. It was difficult in the beginning, but when I played it well I felt so proud of myself. Today he came and realized how much I practiced; I played every chord well, memorized the lyrics and sang on tune. I'm finally starting to have fun playing guitar again, and I just wanted to talk about it somewhere",25Aug2019,1
66,"I'm not going to do it. I don't actually want to die. I'm scared of death. I just want the pain I'm feeling to stop.


As I'm sitting here thinking about reaching out to one of my few friends, I realize that that I'd basically get told that I need to handle my shit, or that I'm being dramatic. The people I want to tell would get mad at my reasoning or throw hard truths at me that will just hurt even more because it's one of those situations where I know exactly what the situation is and I just need someone there who will just give me some comfort from the pain, even if it's for a moment.


I wonder how many people have these thoughts before actually going through it. How many people saw the signs of a loved one or friend who was struggling and would have brushed them off like in my example and turn around saying ""I wish there was something I could have done"", when what they would have done is just say ""suck it up buttercup"".


I hate that I have to post this on reddit and not just talk about it to my closest friends. I know everyone has their own problems, but some people can't just sort it out and just need some loving support.

68,"I'm a 23 yo guy who has literally never had a relationship with a woman. Never. Not even a hot night (I'm still a virgin tho). I was about to have a girlfriend when I was 18. We really liked each other, but I ducked up because of being toxic.

Also, lately I've been trying to be friends with more women in my city that I casually find in Instagram, but most of them just last a few days or even a few weeks, before I lose interest on talking to them (ideas about me wasting their time usually assault me) or viceversa. Sometimes I end up unfollowing them at all.

I have only been in one relationship in my life, and i remember it being a very bad time/experience that i don't want happening to me again, i sure learned a bunch that i could do different now which I'm sure it helps, but, i notice the obsessive thoughts everyone i get close to a girl, i met this very nice girl not long ago and we grew to be really close friends communicating for hours on a daily basis, and i started to obsess over her, thinking about her all the time, overthinking things and just making problems for myself. My mind couldn't rest while we were talking daily, i had to stop doing that at some point, now I'm much better because we talk from time to time and i can control it better, but I'm avoiding relationships for the same reason, i don't want to put myself in a position that's hard to get out of.

81,"I'm starting my first day of med school tomorrow. Except I don't want to do medicine.

My whole life my mother has only wanted me to become a doctor and nothing else (my father was a doctor, an incredibly good one too before he died from a stroke when I was a kid). 

In college I failed twice and had to switch to another pre-u program which I finally passed with the bare minimum to start medicine. I had no direction in college and I guess I was hoping somehow I would make up my mind on something but I didn't.

Before starting university I took a year off to ""think"" about what I wanted to do. My mother was not supportive. She had planned for me to do medicine my whole life and she didn't want to talk about anything else. She said I was afraid of responsibility and if I didn't want to do medicine so badly, then what do I want to do ? I don't know. I don't fucking know what I want to do. My whole life I've never paid attention to other careers, and at the same time I know I don't want to do medicine. Anyway my one year ""break"" ended up with me trying to hide from my problems inside my computer and I spent the whole year playing games until the end and now my course is starting.

I hated lying to the interviewers when I applied for med school, I hated lying to my peers and professors during the orientation pretending that I am actually interested in the career.

I can only see this going two ways now:

I follow along, and almost certainly fail med school because it's FUCKING MEDICAL SCHOOL, people don't survive if they are half-hearted about it. All my peers, professors and family find out that I'm a failure who dropped out. My mother will be disappointed.

Or I stop now and waste one semester's fees. My mother will be furious and everyone will still know I am a dropout. 

&amp;#x200B;

Either way I don't know what to do afterwards. My mother isn't going to help me find out other options, and I've wasted my life so much that I don't know where to begin. I have nobody to talk to about this. You know that stereotype about Asian parents? My mother is exactly that. To her it is medicine or nothing. Every other job is a garbage profession that is not worth doing. She says that if I want to do anything else then I won't get any help from her and in the future I will come back crying regretting not doing medicine. I don't have anybody to turn to because all my relatives have the exact same mindset and most of my cousins are doctors too. My friends in college all went abroad to do things they are passionate about.

Every time I try to bring it up with my mother she gets extremely angry and she says its because I am just lazy and I am avoiding responsibility. Maybe she is right. I don't really have anything to look forward to anymore. I'm not going to do anything because I'm too much of a coward to kill myself so don't worry about that. 

I live in an extremely backwards country in Asia. I'm a minority here and we're treated by the government as second rate citizens. I can't even speak the languages spoken here (English is my only fluent language) and nobody gives a flying fuck about English here. I always had this dream/idea that I would go to study abroad in the future and settle in another country so I would finally belong. I feel like a foreigner in my own country. I can't afford to study medicine abroad because it is the most expensive education course (other courses are way more affordable, but my mother wouldn't care anyway). Besides my grades were the bare minimum to study medicine here, they won't qualify for universities abroad even if I wanted to do something else like engineering. I am interested in astronomy, science, game programming, design but I don't think my results qualify for anything like that and arts courses in this country are akin to being unemployed.

&amp;#x200B;

I've just been going with the flow so far in my life and never had the courage to make my own decision. Now that it's too late to make one and I have to, I don't even know what decision I would make...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't expect anyone to understand my situation since most redditors are Americans and everyone is going to ask me why the fuck I am talking when I got accepted into medical school. I should probably just shut the fuck up. I didn't deserve to get accepted into this school. There are people who dream of getting the opportunity I got and I'm just going to waste it. A complete failure. A stupid fucking idiot who doesn't want to do the one thing that would make my life that much easier. It's embarrassing to even say but I don't even have a reason to keep going, I just do. I don't look forward to anything aside from dumb things like upcoming videogames and movies.",25Aug2019,1
82,"Hello, so i'm an American. And, my whole life Japan has always fascinated me. Of course there's anime, but it's media. It's game shows, it's drama series, it's commercials. I've always loved them all.

Now, why do i bring this up? Well, my whole life, any time i saw something vaguely Japanese. Like cherry blossoms, or the lanterns, or the city lights, the architecture. In a video game or a movie or something, it always brings up this rush of...Nostalgia. Like i've been there before. My whole life i've had this feeling.

It's always the exact same feeling i get whenever i listen to a childhood song, watch a childhood show.

I even have somewhat vague memories of actually walking down the street of Tokyo. I remember it, it's vague but it's also pretty intricate for something that my mind just made up.

83,"The phrase is common enough - ""I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired"". We've all heard it plenty of times before, but now I think I'm really starting to understand it.

Most of my time - slacking at work and lazing around at home - is spent doing things that I don't *really* want to be doing and aren't productive. They don't help move me to where I want to be.

I want to lose some fat, gain some muscle - but I eat almost entirely garbage and only work out 1 or 2 times a week. I'll set alarms early to go workout before work, then just go back to sleep when the time comes.

I want to be healthy and save money - family history of heart disease and living paycheck to paycheck even on high incomes. I'm not paycheck to paycheck, but I definitely waste money on crap that also makes my health worse. Too much booze too often, and then I order takeout with one of the food apps. This happens 3-4 nights a week. I'm killing myself and my finances - especially with the food orders on the app. Exorbitant fees but when I drink I just feel shitty and drunk me thinks food will help. Of course it never does.

I want to learn a ton of stuff. I'm already working in IT and am a decent coder, but I could be a lot better. The time I could spend doing this usually ends up being spent mindlessly redditing - often while drinking.

I have a pile of great books I've started but never finished. I think I own more books now that I haven't finished or started than have. There's nothing wrong with them - I love reading. But the mindless habits get started before I even realize what I'm doing it again.

I want to re-learn algebra and finish my degree (have about a year left) but I always find myself... yup, on reddit, drinking, youtube, or playing a video game instead.

All of the cool and fufilling things I could do and be skilled at if I wasn't so set on wasting my time (and life) with crap that doesn't *really* make me happy. It just passes the time and makes me feel worse later (well, videogames actually make me happy but I digress). My reddit hangover is feeling like shit because I know I just wasted a couple hours looking at crap I don't really care about.

I know exactly how to fix all of these problems. It's simple. cut out the garbage. That doesn't mean it's easy - simple solutions often aren't - but it's not complicated.

I'm done with wasting my life - and making it shorter by being stupid. It ends today, right now. I understand now what it's like to truly be sick and tired of being sick and tired - but also being sick and tired of being lazy, unhealthy, weak, fat, under educated, and broke when I should be saving money like crazy.

All I have to do is all the stuff I actually want to be doing. Instead of mindlessly redditing I'm going to hop on khan academy or read a book. Instead of pressing snooze for an hour I'm going to *at a minimum* go walk the dogs. I'm going to actually eat all my mealpreps instead of freezing half that I replaced with booze and takeout. I'm cutting out alcohol entirely - it's poison and when I really think about it while drinking it doesn't make me feel any better - usually worse or just numb. I'll likely keep Reddit to some extent, but I'm installing a productivity plugin to keep me remind me to get off and I nuked my old account. This one is only going to have subreddits that actually align with what I want to do with my life. I'm going to stop thinking short-term and work on thinking about the long-term.

This won't be easy and I'll probably struggle with it - at least at first. I know the only way to get what I want is to just *go and get what I truly want*. I know there's no other way but to simply do it - because I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.",25Aug2019,1
84,"I was watching Breaking Bad lately and started wondering what it would be like to actually let that inner ""bad voice"" start talking more and influencing your actions. People would describe me as a very passive person, who wants to achieve a lot, but never really speakes my mind, or make a fuss or make my disagreements vocal. Usualy I turn the other cheek, or prefer to not let things escalate, because ""it's not worth it"", or ""I'll be putting more negativity in the world. However, more and more I find myself ashamed of my passiveness, and have started to really disike the ""good person"" persona, the one that does not swear, or use sarcasm (a sence of humor that I secretly love, but fear might hurt people's feelings, even if they have it coming), or straight up take control of my life. 

Has anyone felt that way before? What have you done about it? The more time passes, the more I find myself wanting to get rid of that persona (not entirely, my aspirations don't incluse mass murders, or meth production) and just let my character flow uncensored. Has anyone been throught that transition? If so, what tipped you off, what was the last straw, or you awakaning call? Have you made it and how does that feel? Do you feel guilty, like you betrayed a part of you, or are you more free than ever?

86,"I'm finally understanding what it means to love myself, after years of giving my love to people who weren't deserving of it I have finally realised that the reason why I had self esteem issues was because I havent been loving myself. I think it comes from negative experiences that I had as a teen growing up and then as soon as I hit my 20s I had a skewed perception of reality and how things work (such as attraction, success, love etc). Now at 25, after experiencing a rather nasty break up, it has me feeling, quite happy with myself actually.

I have realised now when it comes to to attraction and women the reason why i felt like no one was interested in me was because i was essentially switched off and clearly gave off the impression that i didnt want to get to know anyone/flirt however i never actually knew that i gave off those vibes at the time.

Now that I am woke and understand myself better I have had so much attention from women and to be honest i feel like it confirms my theory about myself (&amp; by that I dont mean that they contribute to my self esteem at all its just that I have reached a higher understanding of myself and people can see that.)

These findings also have made me understand when women reject guys and they get real butt hurt that its not always anything to do with you or your looks/personality but sometimes its that they just dont understand themselves or know what they want.

Ive realised my self worth and I feel complete in a sense, now I just have to build upon what I already know. I feel this intense warmth all the time now, the feeling of love and ive never felt anything quite like it and I know its real because I am aware that no one can actually make me feel this way apart from myself and its absolutely incredible. 

I have always liked the concept of auras and this experience really has confirmed for me that i really do believe in them. They aren't something that is necessarily tangible however, we respond to people based on their aura or in other words the vibes that they give us.

In the end, I think we are all here to learn and we can only learn so much by reading and talking to peers. You have to experience things to really understand who you are as a person and I finally feel like I'm there. Of course there is still more for me to learn but I now have a solid foundation to build on and that foundation is my self esteem. 

Everything happens for a reason, so to all you people who are going through a tough time, just remember that when you get your epiphany and reflect on all the self esteem issues you had and you will see the reason why everything in your life at that time had to happen the way that it did :).",25Aug2019,3

My problem though is I failed college and dropped out, and now my life is messed up to the point that I have no idea when I'll be back.


People around my age are or will soon be starting their full adult lives. They've had their time to be young and make friends while I've sat alone.



Then when/if I go back to college I'll be the weird older guy. A 30 year old is never gonna make friends in an environment of 18-22 year olds. 


Then from there it's nothing, just 9-5 until you die. I'm only anticipating losing even more friendships from now on and not being able to make any new ones.",25Aug2019,3
97,"It's a lot to process, but I think I feel relieved. It explains a lot. I have been dealing with depression and anxiety all of my life because I felt and KNEW that I didn't fit in and something was off, but didn't understand why. For my entire life, I have tried to convince myself that I was normal and actively blamed myself for my obvious shortcomings. I have been forcing myself into a mold that never fit me in the first place.

I hope that in time, I'll accept that I will never truly be normal like I thought I wculd be. My autistic traits are no longer flaws that I must continually correct in some way. I no longer have to strive to become a person I'll never be. I'm free.",25Aug2019,11
98,"So I'm about to start university and I will be financed completely by my parents. I'm aware that I'm incredibly privileged to have parents who earn a very decent income and are generous on top of that. And I'm scared to come of as very spoiled when I meet new people at university. They give me a good a amount every month, enough to pay rent for my room, food, books and after that I have probably 200€ left to spend on clothes and activities every month. So it's not incredibly excessive but I will be quite comfortable. In my Country you can also get support from the state while studying (but I don't qualify for it because of my parents income) and the maximum amount you could get from the state is about 120€ more than what I will get every month. Just to give you an idea. 
I will definitely get a job after settling in but my education will absolutely be my top priority so I can graduate on time. My parents have also told me that they have absolutely no problem with spending that money on my education because the house is payed of, they are comfortable and they feel that I'm responsible enough with money. I will also definitely pay them back when they are older and might need some money and/or care. 
Still I'm so scared of beeing judged because most people won't know all that and wanted to ask if somebody has any experience with an issue like this? how can I not come of as spoiled? I'm not somebody to brag with money (especially money I did absolutely nothing for) so that is common sense but I feel people already judge me when I mention they finance me.",25Aug2019,2
99,"It’s sunday. I’ve always hated Sundays. They’re slow days where nothing is done and the house is empty. I always get a sick feeling in my stomach on a Sunday. Even when I was younger, I hated them. 

I’m going back to college in 2 weeks. I’m happy and excited to get back to Galway and to the hustle and bustle. But I’m frightened by the fact it could be like my 1st year there in terms of socialising. I felt alone and trapped. I didn’t like my course at first. I was on the other side of the city from my friends from home. Often enough, I blew off assignments to go to them, to fulfil my social need. My house was comprised of me and 3 others. Two were stoners. One was a quiet guy who I’d only run into when he’d come back from classes. The 3 of them never cleaned up after themselves and constantly would blare music at 3-5 am. The only thing I used my house for was a bed. It didn’t feel like a home away from home.  The second semester I found myself going to the library a lot more due to them in the house. It was better then sitting alone in silence.

Last night I was told my girlfriend would come up to me my first week back. I’m excited. I have so much planned to do with her that I know I won’t be able to do when I’m in the thick of things during the year. I hope it’ll set the tone for the year of a good positive vibe in the house.

105,"It happened 2 weeks ago. Watching Pewdipie's wedding video just made me extra sad and I just felt like sharing my feelings with some strangers will somehow help me get through these tough times.

We had been dating for a year but we both knew it was never meant to be. It should be easier to move on since I knew things had been half broken in my heart for quite a while... But there was hope. There were ups and downs and even though the bad times were sad and eye-opening, we were learning a lot from each other during the best times. We had just started to explore so much more during sex and now it's all gone. It's over and I will never have it back. I can't imagine myself enjoying intimacy with anyone else since I was convinced they would be the last person I'd be with. All my passion and kisses belonged to this person and now I feel so stupid. I've been fooling myself thinking we would have a future together and it hurts because we were in completely different stages in our lives. In order to get closure I need to stop thinking of the possibility that our paths with cross again in a future when we both are on the same level but at the same time it's such a nice thought. 

I know I will be fine but it's so hard to fight the loneliness despite all the great friends surrounding me at the moment. 

I go out all the time - instead of staying home crying, eat healthy, I'm finding refuge in my work, which takes most of my time and a lot of things are going on since I moved into my own apartment. I sort of adopted the sweetest cat ever and got three more jobs besides the one I already had. So I am trying to keep myself busy because life goes on but I'd appreciate any kind of advice. Should we stay friends or is it better to give each other some distance for now? I need to know they'll be alright, too, and I want to eat my ego and just ask and be friendly but I also know we can't be close without me having feelings.

106,"A run down of what‘s happened to me since April:
- Loss my hearing 4 times (in right ear only)
Taken high dose steroids to bring my hearing back (5 courses of 7 days each).
- Spent countless hours in the hospital and at audiologists trying to get answers about my hearing.
Lost my job mid June (the whole office closed).
- The last 2.5 months since losing my job I’ve been doing career coaching, studying a short course and trying to enjoy Summer in my city. I was paid 3 months notice which I’ve budgeted to last 5 months, I’ve got 3 months left but no interviews or job leads. 
- Started  taking medication 3 times a day for possible Ménière’s disease which may be causing hearing loss).
- Stopped taking anti depressants for 3 weeks to see if this affected hearing loss - it didn’t  (restarted 1.5 weeks ago).
- Lost my auntie to cancer yesterday (she was diagnosed mid October last year).

I’m struggling. The last 2-3 weeks being out of work has hit me. My aunt being ill has hit me due to the family breakdown of the last 3 years which has meant I haven’t seen much of her recently even though we were really close growing up. Luckily I saw her Friday before she passed Saturday night but I still feel immense guilt/sadness at how our relationship deteriorated and what a waste of time the last few years were.
 
Work I know will come eventually. But I am upset about friends who haven’t reached out in the last few weeks. I’m questioning the people I thought were friends. I deleted Instagram because I see close friends enjoying events and wonder why I wasn’t invited. Or at least why they haven’t been in touch? 
Then I berate myself for being so needy of friendships.

I would appreciate support from the people I’m supposedly closest to.
This morning I reached out to couple of friends about my bereavement because I knew I was in the danger zone. I’m really proud of myself for that but I can’t help but feel shitty about the fact that my so-called “best” friends don’t know. I know I could have told them but I would just get meaningless platitudes and what’s the point?
I’m not sure whether to cut them out or keep them as acquaintances?

I honestly think I need to find some close friends that share my interest and values but I’m completely lost. My confidence is rock bottom. Sorry this wasn’t very coherent.",25Aug2019,1
107,"It actually started off with my friend sending me a screenshot of another girl's Instagram story. She was gushing about how she wants to have a travel blog and she was so happy that her friend (my ex) had so much faith in her that he inspired her to actually go ahead with it.

I was hurt and angry because when I started my blog, I wanted him to support me by joining Instagram and following me. It would've meant the world to me and he said he wasn't interested in Instagram and he would just support me morally. I was a little disappointed, but I shrugged it off. To each their own, right?

But now he's ok ""inspiring"" and ""having faith"" in the idea of a travel blog, a totally redundant idea. He is on Instagram now, following her, liking her posts. At least in my blog, I was creating my own mood boards. How many times do we have to see the scenery of Europe in travel blogs? They act as if the content is so damn original. And she's boasting about how she's visited so many countries. Let's do the math - she's 24 now. She hasn't worked before. So she has gone on vacations on her dad's money. And she wants to flaunt that. Cool. Again, do your own thing.

Except, I'm not impressed with it. And it made me take stock of my own situation. I'm not working on my blog anyway. My career is so far removed from fashion that a) I don't have time for fashion blogging and b) I have to create a certain professional image and no offence to anyone in the fashion industry, but a fashion blog won't help me with that.

Again, no offence to those in the fashion industry, but I started feeling like all of this is shallow. I DEFINITELY felt that her blog was shallow. If I had a fashion blog and called her blog shallow, that's being hypocritical. So I decided that I didn't want to be the fashion blogger any more. I like being well dressed but it ends there. I'm not sharing anything with anyone any more.

But more than that, it's also a way for me to cast away my old self. The old me was someone who was flippant and just wanted to be famous. I wanted the lifestyle of those bloggers quickly and I thought brand deals and shit were the easy way to get to that lifestyle. I was this girl obsessed with glamour and the high life and never thinking practically. I want to grow up and become serious.

I liked my run as a fashion blogger. I'm proud of some of the pictures I've created because to me, they look more artistic than I could ever hope to be. The hours that I spent making those pictures gave me unbridled joy. But I don't enjoy it any more. And I don't want to be clubbed with a girl like her. I've saved the pictures since they are all that matters to me from this whole phase. But beyond that, there's nothing for me to be wistful about. So I'm not regretting my decision to delete it and that's what puts me at peace.",25Aug2019,3

109,"I'm a 25yo woman with two outgoing younger siblings and great parents. I've moved away and we only get together the five of us maybe 4 times a year now, though see each other between. I'm currently abroad for two weeks and we're playing a lot of games.

With some games (but not all), I'm aware that I'm a bad loser. I try not to be, but I'm used to doing well in general and I get embarassed and annoyed when I lose. I'm aware of it and try not to let it impact me, but they'll tease me about not liking losing, it'll feel patronising, and then I'll get annoyed, thus confirming their assumptions. It's obviously unpleasant for all of us, though I definitely end up feeling more excluded. 

It's annoying because I play games a lot with friends, and am far better then at being a gracious loser. I just seem to regress to being a teenager with my family. 

It's also a trait I've noticed in my (relatively new) boyfriend. He was losing a game that my flatmate invited him to play the first time they met and the bf kept saying how he wasn't going to play properly and how tired he was as an excuse. It was embarrassing. I'm hesitant to introduce him to the family because they'll definitely not be impressed by it - as I'm not. 

I think with my family it's tied into other insecurities. I know they aren't delighted with my career choices (I have a good job but I'm not sure what I want to do long term) or my cynicism (they're all activists). I feel like they don't all necessarily respect my other choices (though I know they love me) and I guess perhaps with the games I feel like I'm losing something else.

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

114,"title pretty much explains it. im back for my sophomore year of college and just moved in today. i was in a pretty good mood on the whole drive here with my parents, because im really really close with them. however, i was getting stomach pains from the anxiety of going back and having to go back to doing work all the time. 

it was even more upsetting to say goodbye to my parents because my brother is in the hospital currently.  hes being treated for mental health related reasons, and because of the medication they gave him he hasnt acted like himself at all. its really scary to see someone you love turn into like a stranger and theres nothing you can do about it. its also very sad to leave him in the hospital on his own.

on top of all this i was hoping to have a better year than last year because i didnt really make as many close friends as i would have liked. i got to campus and had a nice reunion with my roommate but other than that, nothing. i made a ton of like casual friends, but i didnt meet my core friends and i feel lost without that. so no one is hitting me up to hang out.

my closest/best friend here transferred this year, otherwise i would be hanging out with her.

i guess i just feel worse because my parents had to leave and theres no events going on around campus. on top of that my roommate left to go to dinner with her parents and now im alone for the next couple of hours. 

one of the worst parts is my mom wasnt that upset to leave me because she thinks that i love it here and i have tons of friends. i dont really have the heart to tell her the truth.

i walked around my floor to see if I could hear anyone in their rooms, but nope, nothing. i dont have the confidence to knock on peoples doors and just introduce myself (at least not when im alone - fuck social anxiety). prob gonna chill and watch netflix and then go to bed early. if my roommate comes back we might come back and go around to peoples rooms, if i feel less anxious.

116,"So I'm a 26-year-old guy with almost no dating experience, save some haphazard encounters from my college years. This is something that happened recently, and I just really have an urge to write it down. I don't have any specific questions, but this whole situation is a big unknown to me. Totally outside of my prior experience. Keep in mind this isn't a full transcript or anything (my memory just doesn't work like that hah), but it's full of details that stuck out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple weeks ago I matched with someone on Tinder. Her profile said she was a certified ""sex, intimacy, and relationships coach"". Her profile was something of an ad, I can't remember exactly but it said something like, ""Do you want to find yourself and increase your ability for intimacy?"" I generally assumed this was a bot or something, but I still messaged her on the off chance it wasn't. From that title I wasn't sure exactly what it is she did, so I just wrote the truth: Finding myself and increasing my ability for intimacy is definitely something I want. I sent her the message and after no small talk at all, we ended up just scheduling an appointment. I had no idea what to expect. I felt a bit weird about the fact that she was using a dating app to look for clients, but I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt.

&amp;#x200B;

I get there and it's this big empty yoga studio with only 1 other car. At this point I'm having a mini-war in my mind between my imagination taking this situation to its sexiest and my realistic/logical side saying no, this is a professional kind of thing and I can't think like that. I meet her and we go into this big empty yoga studio. She puts down 2 yoga mats and we sit facing each other. We talk a little about each other, and she brings the conversation to the topic of intimacy. She explains that she is in a relationship and this is a coaching kind of thing, we're not going to have sex (something I'm not the first to be unsure about, unsurprisingly). That calms me down a bit, but not much. I'm still feeling all kinds of ways based on this situation, and she has this inviting kind of energy, and I find myself talking WAY more openly about stuff than I ever have with anyone. I tell her my entire short history of failed attempts to initiate anything romantic, what happened during the few sexual encounters I had years ago in college, the kinds of fetishes I have (I have a thing for being submissive), the porn I watch, the loneliness I often feel. Really wild stuff to hear myself saying. I told her things I've never said to anyone except anonymously online. Eventually she moves closer to me and I'm really flustered about it. I end up telling her that I have difficulty actually acting in a moment of intimacy, and she tells me that this feels like an intimate moment to her and asks if it is for me. I tell her it is, and she asks me to try acting on it now. I have this minute of hesitation while I try to parse what she's asking, and then at some point lean forward, put my hands on her knees, and told her she was so beautiful, totally sincerely. She seems happy I did this. I'm used to rejection, so this feels good. Really good. She told me we can practice things like that and other aspects of intimacy within this space, keeping it within the bounds of the coaching. I'm still not sure exactly what those bounds are, but a part of me is really enjoying not knowing.

&amp;#x200B;

I came back a week later. Early on I brought up what I'd been thinking at the end last time, ""I'm not exactly sure how to gauge the boundaries of this..."". She misunderstood at first, ""You mean, how to gauge the boundaries when on a date with other people?"" That wasn't what I meant, and I guess she picked that up because she then said ""...or do you mean something else?"" At that point I started to stammer and bit and ended up trailing off. I told her I needed a minute, closed my eyes, and we sat in silence for a little while. I told her, ""I know this is a professional thing and you're probably seeing a bunch of guys like this. And maybe it's because I'm so used to a lack of intimacy and the contrast is throwing me off, but I'm feeling a LOT of things from this."" She told me that all my feelings were ok, that doctors and therapists get these kinds of feelings from patients all the time, and that this is far more intimate than even those relationships. She said we could use this space to practice things I'm interested in, like being dominant and submissive (my heart skipped a beat hearing this), or other things. She told me that it would be ok even if I needed to sit and meditate in silence with her for an entire session. I liked that idea too. We then sat in silence for a long time, staring into each others eyes. Not looking away at all. She told me this was a kind of meditation she doesn't get to do with many people, as a lot of people can't maintain that intensity of eye contact. I told her it's amazing, and in a surge of confidence I shuffled forward so I was sitting right in front of her, us both cross-legged with knees touching, staring directly into each others eyes. I don't know how long we sat like that, but it felt amazing and extremely intimate. We talked a bit like that, but it felt like the kind of conversation you have with someone that's too intimate to share with anyone else, anonymously online or otherwise. Eventually I start to shuffle a bit and she asks me what I'm feeling like doing right now. In my mind I'm imagining pushing her backwards and making out with her ravenously, but I just say, ""things that aren't appropriate to do right now."" She gives me a ""like what?"" kind of response (I can hardly remember), and I started leaning forward, but with this conflicted sense of ""what the hell am I about to do?"" I end up hugging her and just like snuggling my cheek up against hers. She tells me we could cuddle a bit for a while, and I say ok. She asks if I want to be big spoon or little spoon, and I say little spoon. I say, ""I think I should probably be little spoon."" She probably thought that choice had something to do with my dominant/submissive thing, but the truth is I was just trying to hide certain bodily cues that would've been impossible to hide from the other position. Regardless, we lay down on some yoga mats and she presses her body right up against mine. She reaches one arm over me and starts, like, softly kneading one of my nipples over my shirt. Now we're both entirely clothed, but I've been completely naked at times and felt less naked than I did right then. Hell, the few times I've been actually having sex with people I felt less naked than I did right then. I remember her asking how I was feeling, and all I could say was ""Good."" She even tried to ask in what way, but all I could answer was, ""I a lot of ways, in every way."" In retrospect I think she was trying to learn about me for the sake of the coaching, but in that moment I really couldn't think of a thing. Eventually we sat up, and she asked if there was anything else I wanted to talk about. But I told her I couldn't think of a single thought right now, I'm totally silent inside. And I just thanked her and she thanked me. And then I left.

&amp;#x200B;

So that was last week. I have another session on Friday. I've never experienced anything like this in my life and I'm super excited. I'm planning on bringing up practicing the dominant/submissive thing next time. I still feel a bit uncertain about the whole thing, but far less so. I'm more excited than uncertain. It's forcing me to drop my preconceived notions about what to expect out of... life. Which I think is probably a good thing. And I really enjoy the sessions themself so... I guess I'll keep at it.",25Aug2019,3

118,"I just thought about how well I accept the way I look now. I male (18) am not the looker by any means, but for a some time during, say middle to high school when people would call me ugly(one time I was likened to wrong turn), I felt bad about myself and insecure about my looks. I didn't want to look people directly in the eyes and whenever I see another male I'd think about how blessed so to speak they was that they looked normal at least, it also didn't help that twice in highschool when I was walking to my next class and I walked by some girls and overheard one whispering ""how come he so ugly"" or something to that effect and another time a random question why I look the way I do, theres also the time in 9th grade I was walking out of class to go to my next and reach in my pocket for something while thinking, I made a slight face I guess a two girls walked by, stopped, looked directly at me, and bursted out laughing. I used to think to myself that if I had a good personality that I'd find a nice girlfriend, while I still don't have a girlfriend, I realized that the only reason I wanted one was because I felt lonely and was just a horny teen. Eventually I accepted it, I began to look pass my apparent shortcoming and started to enjoy myself, I always had a knack for making people laugh which makes me happy in turn and I've reached the point to truly enjoy the friendships I've made. Even if I'm a little insecure now and sometimes get stumped by my situation, I learned to keep going, people can be terrible but that doesn't mean that I have to be terrible as well. So I strive to be a good person, because that's what makes me feel good, not having a girlfriend or looking like someone's prince charming, but being able to be good, help people, and making others smile.

I’ve met a lot of new people so far and I’m way to extroverted to not make new friends but being alone with little to no money and a roommate who is very picky is kinda killing me. School starts tomorrow but I’m the oldest person in my building so far, I haven’t met anyone older then 19, and I’m being very negative. On the positive side, I
Hope my internship starts soon. And I know I needed to move away from my home town so *deep breath* here we go.",25Aug2019,2
121,"When I moved into this house three months ago, I offered horse shoes to a few of the neighbors as a moving in gift- they’re good luck if you put them above your door and I have quite a few because I used to be a farrier. This lady didn’t come to the door when I knocked and then when she did, I offered and she looked at me like I just tried to hand her a dead bird. Anyways, fast forward to now- I got a puppy for my birthday in July, my son loves to play with the puppy in our yard. She came over yelling at me about leash laws today... we’ve had a few other run-ins where she proved there’s no winning with her but this was over the top. I definitely didn’t hide my opinion when she came to my door. As much as I can agree that leash laws are there for a good reason, this is a little puppy wearing a collar and name tag playing with my son and a neighbor girl. Why are some people so unhappy with their lives that they have to come into a situation raging instead of just SPEAKING. It’s honestly really hard to react kindly to someone who shows up angry. I’m not unreasonable, I’d love to have had the opportunity to correct the problem before she yelled in my face at my own front door! She was sure to mention that I wasn’t the first renter she hadn’t liked and that she’s a HOME OWNER!!! Lol and she doesn’t “give a shit” 😂😂😂",25Aug2019,1
122,"They talk very candidly, about each other's lives, information isn't power, they really care for each other. Seeing my mother is always a source of stress for me, I avoid talking to her and am always on edge when I do. My friend was also lucky enough to have a bigger social circle growing up, and now he's way more charismatic. Funny how everything works out like you'd think. I'm just a pessimist anyway.",25Aug2019,9
124,"I’m 20 years old , from the UK , born in America so I am a citizen but I’ve lived in the UK since I was two years old and I consider this my home. I live with my mother and my father lives in America. I am sadly failing college and I won’t be getting back in when it starts again, I’ve repeated this year before and I once again failed so I can’t repeat it again I just can’t afford it and if I failed twice maybe it’s just not for me. I don’t know what else to do other than move to America with my father and pick up a trade over there and live there since he can guarantee me a job which is what i need since I’m still lost in life and need a kick up the butt to direct me. I love America I’ve visited it but I don’t want to move. I love where I currently am and I love my mother and my friends and I don’t want to leave them. My older brother left for America and my mother was devastated and I know her next son leaving to a whole other continent will destroy her since I’ll never be able to see her except once or twice a year. And my friends... I love them so much and can’t imagine life without my best friend but I know I’ll lose contact because of time zones and just pure effort to upkeep it and when I move to America i will have no friends and seeing my current friend group have fun when I’m gone without me is going to kill me because that could be me out there with them. I don’t want to leave my mother and my friends i love them too much and I don’t want to leave my country either I love it more than anything... the culture , the people , the atmosphere it’s just perfectly suited towards me, i have to abandon it all and move across the world in a month and I’ve just been crying thinking about it. How will i cope? How do I deal with it all? Leaving my friends behind , I don’t know if I can emotionally handle it, I’m a very social guy and I need to talk to people and moving will make me unable to do that. I always figured these would be my friends for life , I’ve already made so many memories with them throughout the years I’ve known them, leaving them will be the hardest thing I’ll have to do cos I know the toll it will take on me but to them it’s just one friend leaving the group but to me it’s all of them leaving me... I don’t know... I just am really sad right now and trying to accept the reality that my life is going to go from what it is now... to something I do not want (leaving friends and mother , I do want the job part lol) 

Thanks for taking time to read , If you have been in a similar boat or just have any life advice I would be forever grateful :]",25Aug2019,1
