0,"I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like nothing I do ever works out for me no matter the amount of effort I put into something or not. I started college last year and so far I have maintained a 4.0 GPA (something I’ve never done in my life) and I thought that would keep my life meaningful and purposeful but it hasn’t. Not even kidding, I barley had to even try for straight A’s so it doesn’t even feel like an accomplishment to me. My boyfriend chose to support me financially while I went to school but the feeling of not having a job actually depresses me. I hate not being able to buy whatever I want, when I want, I hate feeling like a burden to him and always needing to ask him for money when I want to be able to support myself. So, I got a job. The job I got ended up getting shoplifted while I was the ONLY person scheduled to cover the ENTIRE store so my crooked boss demanded I cover the cost of the stolen items ($450) obviously who the fuck would do that? So, I quit. I was done working entry level jobs because I have an extensive resume considering I started working at 12 years old so I feel like it’s time for a step up. I ended up getting, what I thought was perfect for me, a job as a medical assistant. That job ended up fucking me over because my boss literally admired my work ethic so much that he rather me be his PERSONAL ASSISTANT, scheduling car repairs, maintenance to his 2.1 Mil dollar home, tutoring his kid, rather than a medical assistant where I contribute to the community, help sick patients, and genuinely enjoy  ( and where my actual skills and knowledge are based in). Since I just started there, they were cutting hours considering a lack of business and my boss basically stated it was either be his personal assistant or find a new job; so I quit. This really set me back because I enjoyed what I was doing so much, and for it to be ripped right underneath me, it was a defeat. I feel like I’m a brat because I don’t want to settle for some piece of shit job. I feel like I did my time working shitty jobs. I want something new, better. But everything I go after doesn’t work out, or requires time/money/resources I don’t have. I have a savings account, around 2k, but I can’t even come up with a good enough idea for a business or investment. I have enough finances that will cover me this month, and next month, including my savings, but that time is running out. I need a job by November ideally but I refuse to settle as a server, hostess, retail, customer service (been there done that); I’m ready for a change. Is it really that crazy to say that I want to do what actually makes me happy for once? I had a shitty childhood (got kicked out at 16) so I know what it feels like to struggle. I almost feel like I DESERVE something good for a change, but nothing ever works out for me. I’m suffering so bad from learned helplessness that I really want to throw in the towel and give up. I just want to make money doing something I actually enjoy why is that so fucking hard. I could scream to God with these questions and still hear nothing as a response. I’ve applied, interviewed, followed up, nothing. All of the jobs I want require more certifications and education, something I don’t have yet. But every job I could get “for the time being” seems soul crushing and a waste of time. I’m honestly lost, scared, and hopeless. My life is never smooth sailing. It’s always a chaotic shit storm that no one around me seems to be experiencing. I’m realizing that I’m just going to have to settle with a low paying job until I’m out of college but even then, what? How am I so sure a college degree will land me to where I want. How do I know what I want? At this point I’m about to say fuck everything and go to the military, hopefully I’d get drafted or something. I’m just lost y’all. I feel like no matter what, life is a game that only wants &amp;wants &amp;wants &amp; wants from me but wants to give me nothing in return. Yes, my life could be worse. But it could also be better. And yet, it’s not. Honestly nothing I said in this post probably makes any damn sense I just don’t know what I want to do. For Gods sake, I’ve resulted to an Internet forum to ask for help. 

P.S yes, I’m diagnosed with depression as well as GAD, OCD, and some PTSD. I’m not on any medications for them considering medications made me feel crazier. I do however see both a psychologist and psychiatrist. They have helped, but not really.",06Sep2019,1

2,"I have never told anyone, this is a new account for me, but I just feel like I need to say it to someone. About a year ago, I started getting this... feeling. Wearing dresses suddenly seemed wrong to me, I didn't want to wear them, people would always think I was a girl. Which was confusing for me, because I had never questioned my gender before, I was always female and nothing else. Yet here I am, announcing to the internet that I AM MALE! Not that anyone I know will find out. 

Its not like they wouldn't be accepting. Its just that... It would be weird. Everything would change, my world would topple, my friends in school would perceive me differently. 

I wouldn't be plain old \[REDACTED\] anymore, I would be someone else. I really want to tell everyone I know, but I also know that by doing so I will be putting unwanted change in my life.

3,"I just got a call from a private number at work. It was from someone asking to speak to the key holder. He somehow knew only one person works at a time at the store I work at. He claimed to be loss prevention at the corporate office, saying the manager owes a ton of money and is going to be investigated by the IRS.

The guy said if I told the manager, I’d be charged with a felony of hindering an investigation. He said the IRS was going to come, and then the store would be shut down tomorrow. 

He wanted me to answer a series of questions on the recorded line. I refused by saying I just do my job and nothing else. He said I was engaging in “noncompliance” which could shut the store down for months.

6,"Yesterday I interviewed for a state parole officer position. They said they’d email in a week or two with a yes or no.

My step father and mother are also pretty high up for the state in corrections, my step-father actually emailed the last guy I interviewed with and put a “good word” in for me, the guy responded back and simply said “he did a great job”. I’m really anxious because it’s going to be a great improvement for my life. It pays more, you set your own dayshift hours (I’ve been working 3rds), has more variety and is a step up in the criminal justice field. They’re hiring 15-17 people for the position so I’m really hoping I’m one.

8,"Recently a police investigation had to happen where I had to recount my sexual assault and other things I didn’t want my mother to know but since I’m a minor she has to know.  She found out and told my dad and grandma and they put restrictions on me. 

Ever since I’m investigation I’ve gotten sad by everything, angry pretty easily, and then I just full on shut down and show no emotion. This happens a lot

I’m thinking this is a response to the whole investigation and having to re-live the whole sexual assault and other stuff that happened that I didn’t really every try to process and just swept under the rug. 

An example of me getting easily angry is I wanted to take my hamster out to show my dad it’s tail and the differences between mice and hamsters and then he actually quite politely told me not to and to just leave it and I got angry and took it as him not thinking I was responsible and that I was an idiot. 

Another instance when I completely shut down was when my mom brought up the whole investigation I just shut down and refused to give more than one word answers in a monotone tone

15,"So I went on a date with this guy from my office. Everything was perfect and we are very similar. However…I had no feelings towards him what so ever. I kissed him on two separate occasions that night and I still felt nothing.

SIDE NOTE: I’m the type of gal that gives (almost) everything a chance. And for everything I decide to try, I give it 3 chances. If I don’t like it, I drop it.

Anyways, it’s only been the first date, but I’m gonna try again Friday night. But just in case I need a rescue. I’ve devised a plan to get me out of there. Since we are going to watch a movie, in any point I can ask if our friend could join us. And I actually enjoy their company and it will allow me to keep away from my date for the rest of the night.

In case things don’t work out though, what do I say ? I want to be stern enough to where he gets the message but nice enough to where he doesn’t wanna kill himself afterwards or something.

(He’s very persistent and doesn’t take the first no seriously and keeps pressing the same thing over and over again)

Every time I think of us kissing it’s like I’m reliving some type of fucking war flashbacks. He wasn’t a bad kisser, but I don’t know…I just felt, nothing !
I felt empty. But it also takes me a while to warm up to people which is why I’m giving it a shot. I’m just feeling like a really chaotic bisexual at the moment. (I am female, if that wasn’t clear)",06Sep2019,1
16,"Well here’s the story about it. 


So about 10 years ago my mom went out of town, and just like any high school teen I wanted to have a little party. This party ended up having about 40 people more than originally intended. Needless to say it was crowded as hell in this house.

Skip ahead a few hours towards the end of the night when everyone is trickling out. Myself and a few friends were doing a sort of pre-cleanup recon. We come across ole Caren in the kitchen with her pants around her ankles; now at the time it didn’t seem like that big of a deal. We just sort of ushered her to a spot to sleep off whatever drunkenness fell over her.

The next morning when were cleaning, Caren slipped out of the house never to be seen again. While we were cleaning up, we smelled a smelly smell that smelled...smelly. We could not for the life of us figure it out. Eventually we gave up and decided that our lingering hunger was more important. I took the opportunity to preheat the oven to 425 for pizza rolls...that ended up being the biggest mistake in recent human history. This only increased the raunchiness ten fold. I opened the oven to put the food in and the most distinct smell hit me right in the face. Now this is something I’ll never forget; the appearance of this mound is something out of a Goosebumps novel. It looked like something similar to my neighbor’s Rottweiler feces.

At this point, we didn’t know what to do. After a few minutes of dry heaving, I built up the courage to clean it. I didn’t have much on hand except an old spatula and some degreaser. The real fun began after i made my initial scoop...have you ever stabbed a fork into slightly undercooked brownies? A nice crust built up on the outside, but inside was a liquid so vile that not even the the craziest of war criminals would consider using this as a bio weapon. This was the lava cake from hell.

Eventually everything was “clean” and disposed of. Later that day, my mom came home and of course was curious about the stench that hardly died down. I told her with my sweet teenaged charm that we simply burnt a lasagna (only a partial lie). She bought it and we moved on. I thought everything was over.

I was wrong.

Rewind to the discovery of said shit casserole. My buddy, Zane recorded the findings on his phone...for science. Anyway, he eventually uploaded this to Facebook and tagged me along with many others in this video which made it pop up on my mom’s timeline. My mom wasn’t too thrilled with the fact that she’s been cooking dinners in that oven for the past six months completely unaware of the poo essence fusing with our food. That day ended with a new oven being installed.

Some of you may ask what happened to the demon we know as Caren. Well, she never admitted to doing it. She also never agreed to a DNA test, but deep down I know it was her. We all know, Caren.

I remember my sister holding her pets in her hand crying and my parents with her. When I asked her about them more recently to make sure it actually happened, she said yes, you killed them. 

Now I can’t even think about harming an animal. I feel so empathetic towards them and love them. 

It must’ve been my extremely young age and not understanding that they weren’t toys, that I had to be careful with them and that they were living animals. 

It still bothers me a little when I think back to it",06Sep2019,1
21,"I think I'm really depressed. I think my depression started in high school, but I did nothing about it until college. I started seeing a counselor in college, for three out of four years, and got on antidepressants (Lexapro). After graduating college, I stopped seeing a counselor, and quit my antidepressants as well. I was starting a cool new job in my field of study at a cool company, and moving in with my long-distance boyfriend (whom I was seeing in college). So life was going great for me! I thought it was ""cured"". But I got sad again, smoked weed daily for a year and a half, and started a new batch of antidepressants. I have since quit the weed, but still on antidepressants (Effexor). 

I guess I just keep expecting that the antidepressants are a magic pill, that will give me excitement, vigor, and fervor for life. But they are not. I don't even know if they are actually helping, or if they are just an emotional crutch. Just making me feel like ""well I'm taking antidepressants, so I have my depression and feelings under control"".

Every day, I just got to work. I am only motivated to work so that my co-workers will think that I'm smart or competent and so that my manager will give me praise or tell me I'm doing well. I do admit that doing something and getting things done helps me feel slightly better. But the feeling fades quickly. Even just the daily every day activities like putting on clothes, brushing my teeth, going to the bathroom, getting water, driving, etc. are just too much for me. It's just so exhausting.

When I come home from work, I just sit on the couch and passively watch TV or play games on my phone or browse Reddit. I have no energy or desire to do anything else or see other people. Basically just passing the time until it's late enough to take ambien and then pass out until I need to go to work tomorrow. 

I just don't know what to do about this. I just don't want to do anything at all. I'm not suicidal, but at the same time, I just feel that there is no point to doing anything. I don't have a greater goal in life and I don't have anything to work towards. All my life, I've been working towards good grades, to get into a good college, good grades again, to get a good job. I don't know, I just can't even at this point. 

Sorry, this became very rant-y and ramble-y. So I'll just end it here.",06Sep2019,1
23,"I'm 29, 30 next month. I work for myself, alone mostly, and I go to lots of events where I'm around people but not part of it.

I'm very lonely so I go out. I'm not really a bar guy but I like a little beer sometimes. People tell me I need to go out and meet people so I do.

But honestly, and maybe its because I'm olderish, that doesn't work out in reality. Everyone is in the friend group, everyone is paired up I'm very social and easy to talk to, I feel comfortable with new people very easily but no of that really matters  when your just ""the guy who's alone at the bar."" Your a weirdo, ""why don't you have friends? Why are you just sitting there?""

It doesn't appear to be a realistic expectation to make new friends by going out alone, but maybe I'm missing something. I'm open to suggestions, and yes I've tried Meetup and blah blah blah, I hate all that online stuff, it never works out and there's nothing that interests me in my area.

25,"We met in the summer of 2018. We started as coworkers but became friends. I appreciate his friendship a lot, but also...

We have nearly identical tastes in music, and often blast music and sing together while we work, or listen to new releases by our favorite artists for the first time together. We tease each other, have silly debates about trivial things, and have more inside jokes than I’ve ever had with anyone else. 

I love how passionate he is about his goals, and how that trickles down into everything he does. I love his humility and how he doesn’t take himself too seriously, how self assured he is. He’s unashamedly himself, from his goofy, cackling laugh (which I love) to his dumb jokes, his dramatic performances of pop ballads to how openly and fiercely he cares about things. 

So yes, I feel like I truly know him, well enough to say that I’m in love with him, although you may disagree and say it’s obsession. Because my feelings for him are, to my more-than-likely-accurate knowledge, unrequited. He’s in a serious relationship and shows no 
more than a friendly, casual regard for me. 

The way we talk and joke with each other could easily be mistaken for flirting and our other coworkers joke about us dating or being romantically interested in each other, but he has no more than a passing interest in what I say. He doesn’t make excuses to be around me or talk to me. He keeps his distance when it comes to physical contact. Of course, he’s not the type to have an emotional affair with another girl while in a relationship, but I think that I personally can divine people’s opinions of me pretty well. 9/10 chance he has no romantic interest in me. 

That’s the way it’s been for a long time. I’ve seen him go through rough times, I’ve seen him sick, I’ve seen him get a new job and countless haircuts. I feel like I’m stuck in limbo. I’m completely in love with him, yet I’m just a friend who probably barely crosses his mind when I’m not around. Will we end up dating? Highly unlikely. Will I get over him? Again, unless we’re forced apart for a long time, highly unlikely. But that’s just how things are for me, I guess.",06Sep2019,2

34,"This year has been eventful one. At the start of the year I was working a dead-end job at a major retailer, when I received notice I was being laid off and paid a decent severance if I didn't want to apply for another job in the company. I decided to take the money and run, not knowing what the future would hold. I ended up being unemployed for 6 months before starting a new job this summer. I took a vacation, and really spent time thinking about me and the kind of person that I wanted to be. I had hidden in a shell the previous few years, really withdrawing from the world around me. I've started socializing with my friends more, and with the new job I finally feel good about myself. I feel appreciated for the first time in far too long, and that feeling is intoxicating. 

I have chosen to be single for some time now. My heart got broken through a series of events, and I really didn't want to open myself up to that again. I needed to focus on loving and appreciating myself, before I could even think about asking another person to do that. I didn't want to put that burden on my partner. I had spent some time on dating apps, but I never found any success through them. Until a couple of months ago, it had been years since I went on a date. I finally went on a date a month ago, and it went no where. We had talked for a while before the date, and it seemed like we had a lot in common. She ghosted me within the week. 

Like I said earlier, I started a new job recently. The company is hiring rapidly, and a new colleague also started a few weeks ago. During training she reached out to me for a problem she was having with something, and I was able to quickly solve it for her. From there things have evolved, and I can definitely say there is something there between us. I recently learned that one of the local art museums has a free night every week, so today at work (with just the two of us around) I casually mention what I had learned. She replied that she can't this Thursday (with out me asking her to go with me). So I followed up by asking about next Thursday, and she said that she was free. I then confirmed that she'd like to go, and she followed up with ""Oh hell yes!"" She had asked herself into a date before I could even ask her.

Logically, this seems like a really bad idea. The whole ""don't shit where you eat"" type thing. Ground rules will need to be laid, but I think I'm finally ready for this. I've undergone a transformation, from someone who keeps to them self out of fear of being hurt, to someone who is willing to open them self up to new things, and new people. I still have many things I need to fix, but I am far more confidant in myself and finally find value in my presence. I am on the start becoming me.",06Sep2019,2

My first love was genuinely magical for the first year. We were so, *so* in love, and to be honest my time with him made me let go of a lot of the anger that I used to harbour toward my family and the world and myself. It was a very healing love for what felt like a very long time -- not because it was *bad* of course, but because it felt like we'd known each other and been together forever and our relationship was just some natural, borderline-divine continuation of what was always supposed to be. 

Buuut, the last few months were toxic as hell. I wasn't perfect, I am under no impression that I was, but I'm slowly realising that *he* wasn't either. 

A lot of things got on my nerves toward the end of our relationship, and even after when we decided to stay friends because it was amicable and we *had* been so good together and known each other for so long (we went to high school and university together), plus besides the bullshit we really did get on very well and were very compatible on the whole of things. 

It's been a year now and I've realised how terrible some of his behaviour was. I spoke with my father about it earlier today and he basically told me 'I told you so' (in a slightly more sympathetic way than that sounds, ahaha) and goddamn, gotta say -- his first impression turned out to be right in a lot of ways. My ex *wasn't* some terribly awful individual; he came from a hard childhood, we're both young, I get it. I can be empathetic to those things.

But looking back, there were a lot of times when he was straight up rude to me - he was short, snappy, would make sometimes kind of odd comments on my appearance without being prompted (an example I can remember is the length of my nails, specifically them being too long), and would later blame it on being tired. I mean...I get tired too, man, doesn't mean I get to be a dick to people I love! Listen, first couple times, I get it. Non-issue, let it slide. Guy's tired, messed up a little, whatever. But when it comes such a pattern, and when it seems like he's mostly only ever ""tired"" with me...? Whenever I brought it up with him (I'm not an ""angry"" person. The only time I was genuinely mad with him was one time he used the word 'bullshit' directed *at* me. I swear a lot, but never *at* people and I would never in my right mind -- and even then I never, ever yell. I just told him to close the door and sit down and sternly said to never swear at me again and that that's a line I don't want crossed. Felt bad about even that afterwards, but as per usual, his feelings came first and I felt bad for making him feel bad), he would ask me why I wouldn't just give him the benefit of the doubt. Every time I would feel at a loss for words -- my feelings as I recognise them in hindsight were that there was no *doubt* to give benefit to. I *knew* he was a good person, I *knew* he meant well, I was confused and hurt by his actions and trying to share that with him. This happened *every* time I brought up something I wasn't happy with -- he catastrophised it, and made me feel bad for making him feel bad. I wasn't exempt from doing this either, but I did this for a few months toward the end of our relationship. He did this for a few months at the end of our relationship, and for a year afterwards. When does it cross the line from miscommunication to borderline gaslighting, ya know?

I contorted myself for his benefit when we lived together. I cooked every single meal for both of us (and paid for the majority of it) and when *he* cooked it was some big event, I didn't wear things that made him uncomfortable to think of me being seen by other men, I barely hung out with *any* other people because it made him upset but was at the same time expected to wait at his beck and call while he hung out with others. Over the summer, we almost dated again at the beginning -- I fell a little bit back in love with him, I think. I was sitting on a couch with him and had never, *ever* wanted to kiss someone more. I'd genuinely never experienced that before, not even at the start of our relationship. Maybe because when we were together, I could just *do it.* Then he distanced himself again when he no longer needed me - at least that's how it felt. He would confide to me about how we had been distant, and not really had any meaningful conversations lately, and then do the equivalent of shrugging and walking away by just...not making any effort to change that and still not talking or engaging with me. It felt like he expected *me* to do all the actual work to keep any sort of friendship up. And me being little old doormat me, I did. And sacrificed a good deal else to do it before I gained a little more self-respect and self-love at the end of the summer.

Even now I wonder: was it all in my head? Was it *really, actually* **just** me? And it's hard to reconcile still loving him (not *in* love, I'm content without him though admittedly it is still a little odd at times - and honestly we have barely spoken in a month now) and caring about him. How can I *know* these things, or at least *feel* like these things happened, and still feel so confused and conflicted about not being a part of his life anymore and hurt and as though I will always love him? It's a weird, contradictory, backwards emotional place to be sometimes. I don't cry about it, and honestly it would take some concentrated effort in order to do so, but...it just feels off sometimes. Sometimes my life feels like someone has moved the careful scaffolding of it one inch to the left and while its odd and I keep bumping into things I used to know the placing of like the back of my hand, it's still fundamentally *mine,* just different. I don't know if that makes any sense.

My divorced dad decided (i dont think it wad an accident) to have a child with a lady not older than me by 10 years and that is weird as fuck but it definitely got weirder when it was confirmed they were having a child together, a solid 10-4 over the radio confirmed. I dont agree with the situation but none of it is my half sister's fault, absolutely none of it. Tonight I put her to sleep cause she was being fussy for her parents, I loved every moment of it but I'll always cherish it because I felt her little heart beat on my finger, one individual finger, so precious.

45,"Extremely strict/controlling/'conservative' parents meant I couldn't date in my teenage yrs.

University and freedom came, dated some guys, some of whom wanted a relationship, but these relationships were short lived.

Then something struck: I got too attached to one particular guy I *thought* was amazing. Our relationship was fast, intense and fizzled. It became a 2 year 'tumultuous' on-off relationship with no real commitment and we did a few things, but the intimate side of things was not great. We could be very emotionally intense, but both had our issues. The toxicity of it all kind of scarred me.

Since, I have had some pretty bad sex with a few guys that I've not connected with.

BUT the things that annoys me about myself: the few rare gems of guys, who have expressed their interest and made me feel great, those are *always* the ones I have instinctively pushed away, I suppose out of FEAR...of getting hurt. I don't know why I do this - but can think of a couple reasons from my upbringing/ various assaults, unfortunately.

Either I've pushed these guys away or some unlucky circumstance like moving away or job will stop things.

I'm 26, but I just feel old with a lot of regrets behind me. I feel like I haven't lived. I feel like I haven't connected with anyone romantically or sexually, really.

App dating has not been fruitful - it feels like a forced job interview, wading through plenty of people looking just for hook ups.

Can anyone provide hope/advice?

46,"That thought crosses my mind, randomly, making me ask myself how things would be. I’ve never been interested in having a relationship, not even as a teenager, but now as 21 year old I’m wondering how different would be. Like, I’m not even that desperate nor considers it important. It’s just a mere thought, I suppose. But, I’ve noticed that throughout my life no one have been attracted to me or maybe I’m just oblivious. Probably, I’ve turned them down without exactly knowing their feelings. It’s funny honestly, as I promised myself to not get attracted to someone just so my family won’t say “I told you so”. (I’ve told before that I really don’t want a boyfriend and my family “aunt, uncle, grandma” always gives me the “you’ll change your mind.” Especially, when I’m not even interested in getting married.) maybe I am trying to challenge them that not everyone thinks like them. As you can see, all my life I’ve been told about boyfriends and how cute couples are, how romantic, and beautiful is to be in a relationship. But, deep down I view it as cheesy. I don’t like the idea of someone kissing me nor touching me, I don’t know....hell even receiving kisses in the cheek makes me uncomfortable (I only allow my parents to hug me and kiss my cheek) 

I do get feelings, crushes, but it passes very fast.  It’s weird. 

Yet I sometimes wonder how would it feel to have a boyfriend, but then the appeal is suddenly gone like how quick appears.  

My friends are like wait until you find the “right one”. But I ask to myself that perhaps what you feel and what you want is the right thing.  

At 17 I thought I was a freak...I still think I’m a freak. Everyone around me have been in a romantic relationship but I don’t think I want to be in one. I don’t find it appealing.

What's the point? 



How many people are *actually* content and satisfied with their lives? How many of those people who are were born into relative financial comfort or stable families and had things just fall into place for them along the way?


Like it or not unless you're rich then working *has* to be the most important thing in anyone's life. It just is. You need to have money to live and you have to prioritize work over anything else. A lot of people would say family is more important but what pays to support that family - - literally to keep them alive? What keeps *you* yourself alive? If you don't work then you die, that's almost a direct correlation. Especially in the US not having enough money is a death sentence and most people think that's ok.


If you work 40 hours a week (which isn't as much as a lot of people do) for say 40 years then that's like 9 and a half years spent working, and you never have any choice in it.


Literally from birth kids are conditioned to be good worker bees and not happy or good people. That's what matters.


So I'm fighting through absolute hell and trying not to end it, and for what? The only end goal is working until I can retire where I'm too old to do anything. Anything I do along the way is secondary, since like I said you have no choice but to make work your #1 priority. You can say it isn't the most important thing in your life but it is, unless you have a family treasure chest or some source of good passive income.


Anything anyone does is to distract themselves from how pointless their lives are -- that practically any job that exists could replace your position within the hour even if you disappeared.

Everyone thought I'd take it but I turned it down... I'm not entirely sure why but my gut was telling me not to take it and I would be miserable if I did. The job is located an hour away from the city I currently live in, and is in a small town with about 800 residents.

60,"So I should mention I'm 19M and they're all 19-23 F/M.We all work at a pizza restaurant and I've been friends with them for almost two years now. 

Despite some occasional fallouts with two of them I've maintained a pretty close relationship with them for awhile now and I genuinely view as being akin to siblings in how much I care about and value them. I guess you could say they're kind of my world in a way since I never really had  a whole lot friends or anything going on in my life outside of things involving them.

I'm not perfect really I've done things to betray two of them in particular's trust, I occasionally lie to their face, and sometimes I go through emo phases where I question if I even like them (maybe this is one of those phases).

But lately I've begun to feel like a tacked on side dish to their main course, or an afterthought in their minds, hell sometimes I feel like a plan b for them. It hurts, a lot.

I'm single, and I've been for nearly a year now. I like it, a lot actually. Don't get me wrong I've had the occasional crush or so while being single, but ultimately my life is too stressful for me to be in a relationship. I'm a bit of an emotional wreck (obviously) and I'm just not mentally ready to dedicate myself to someone in that way, it's too much for my weak brain.

I hate the term third wheel, it's something I was called a lot in highschool when my two best friends happened to be dating eachother, but it's a prevailing thought I've had for awhile now. My core friends are all in relationships and that doesn't bother me, I want for them to be happy. It can even be thrilling when I here how happy they are in their respective relationships.

I feel left out in some sense then because of me being single. Everytime I hang out with them I feel invisible and muted. If I try to do things with them like grab lunch, it feels like I'm paying for them to go on a date. I just feel ignored.

I rarely get invited to things anymore. If I'm hanging out with them, the majority of the time it's because I made the plans. And hell, when I do make plans there's like a less than 50% chance they follow througb anymore. They typically cancel and I've straight up been told they forgot about me.

It hurts, like a fuckton. I've become desensitized to them even flaking. What hurts is that it when from a rare occurrence that was usually followed with profuse apologies to what's expected.

I'm not attributing my feelings solely to being single, that would be immature and moronic. But when your friend hosts a housewarming party and everyone, but you, is with their plus one so you're left so bored you're sitting on the couch on your phone with almost no one to talk to then it is an immature and moronic feeling that is tremendously hard to shake. I feel selfish for it.

I'm supposed to be the guy that's chill and likes to be alone, but I often hate being alone. Even when I do hang out with them it's usually awkward for me, since they'll bring their respective significant other ( who I forgot to mention are also useful my friends and in some cases best friend) and most conversation involving me, is initiated by me and sort of glossed over by them. 

And now here I am. My 20th birthday is in just under three weeks and I feel like half of them don't know and the other don't care. I want to have a party, whether it's at my house or a dojo in the mountains I don't really care, I just want a reason to be around all the people I love wholeheartedly. But I'm scared they don't want to do anything or even acknowledge it at this point.

I just want my friends to attend to me more and I feel so selfish and narcissistic just for saying that, but I'd be lying if I said I like the way things are at the moment. It's sad thinking in such a stuck in highschool ttpe manner. Third wheel? Birthdays? Adults shouldn't give a shit about this kind of stuff, but I do. Maybe I'm the problem.

62,"Hello guys, I wanted to express my feelings about my summer crush. So i just got back from my trip to Bulgaria on which I’ve been with a group of my friends. I was chilling in the aqua park when I first saw that dude and I immediately felt so attracted to him I decided to grab his attention and get him into our circle just to get to know him better. Well I succeeded and we started to go out in the evenings, drink together and stuff like that. So at first he looked totally straight to me, he was saying things like “oh man check out this chick”,  “have you seen her? I’d totally hook up with her” etc. I was like fine he’s straight, he even listens to music where women are objectified heavily. But one time when we were all drinking my female friends gave me a massage from the back and he just like started massaging my shoulders from the front. I was like ok it was nice but whatever. So that night he wanted us (he, me and some of my friends) to get naked into the sea. I declined but went in my boxers anyway, he went naked and wanted me to do the same which is again not a big deal. 

He slept in my room all the time at night because he didn’t want to wake up his siblings I guess. He once even lied on my back right above my ass. Then he was touching my back and like stroking it on several occasions which had never happened to me before with other guy friends and he did it couple times a day. Ok so it’s still nothing, he was perhaps trying to be nice and anyway he still was commenting on other girls’ boobs etc. he even wanted to be with my female friend after like 2 days of knowing her but she wasn’t interested lol. I know it’s a mess but please keep reading. So one time I was lying in my bed with him and my female friend came over to us for a platonic hug in the bed, she was lying between us and he hugged her and she hugged me. But then he started to hug me also and I got his hand closer to me, It felt so fucking good and I was fucking dumb to be like omg maybe it’s a sign and get my hopes high. I know it’s dumb but I fell for every bit of attention cuz I’ve been single for my whole life. Ok so here’s comes our last day. It’s been fine but then he was making those stupid remarks again about women, he even sent a paragraph to another girl he met on the holiday to take things further. So I was like ok I’m dumb he’s 100% straight and he probably likes to touch people I guess. 

I went for drinking with my friends and he came to join us. We got drunk and we were hugging eachother telling ourselves how much we will miss eachother and he even said I’m the most important for him which again made me feel the warmth in my heart. One time I was like talking about two guys who were sitting by the bar and I said that one of them keeps smiling at me and I also said that wow and they are so tall and he got mad a little like “whatever” kind of attitude. But the night went on, we kept drinking but sadly I had to go to get my suitcase and head to the airport, so he was waiting for us in the reception he said goodbye to my friends and gave them a hug, then he hugged me and said again that I’m the most important for him to my ear. I couldn’t help it and I totally broke down in the bus cuz I miss him. I know it’s dumb cuz it wasn’t even that serious It’s just how I feel. I don’t event know what I am asking for, an advice how to get over such situations or I a validation that there’s no chance he could be interested in me cuz he’s straight.

Update: he just texted me and said he misses the whole group and then he called me while tipsy.

I don’t really blame them as they usually are absolutely shit-faced but I find it harder to work in that situation each time. I have a shift tomorrow night and I feel terrible about it! I cancelled a shift last week as a friend was coming around for a catch up and my boss asked the day before for me to work, so I feel trapped and not able to cancel again. In addition to all this, I’m going to university soon and I think the pressure is building up even more and making me feel worse. As scared as I am to do this, should I cancel my shift and quit completely due to the stresses it puts on me? I have worked there for almost 2 years so I feel like I’d be letting my coworkers and my parents down for not being able to hold the job. Once again, sorry for the rant but I’m already in a bit of a panicky state about tomorrow’s shift. 

TL:DR I’m feeling really bad about wanting to quit my job but it has a really negative effect on my mental health and makes me feel physically sick, should i quit so I can focus on uni in a calmer state of mind?",06Sep2019,1
80,"A little while ago at work, my friend and I were just shooting shit about random things and the subject of race and dating came up. He and I are both not white, and are both mixed race. He's darker than I am and would easily pass as black, and his girlfriend is white. Blond hair, blue eyes, pale, the whole thing. I decided to ask him some questions regarding his preference, since we had talked about things like that before.

My friend is not nerdy at all, and is very athletic. He frequently hangs out with other athletes and goes out quite a lot to parties; drinks casually, smokes, whatever. We both have a similar friend group and even know people from other jobs we worked at, but the people he knew were all athletic in some way. I want to say this to give you an idea of what kind of person is saying this.

I first asked him if he would date a girl taller than him, to which he replied pretty staunchly with, ""No dog, I couldn't. She's gotta be shorter than me. I can't fuck with tall bitches."" I replied with, what if she's attractive and she likes you a lot. He said it would still be a no-go for him. He's average height like me, if that gives you any ideas about the statement.

I then asked him a race-related question.... Would he date a girl darker than him? He actually paused for a second and had to think about it. He started the sentence off with, ""Honestly dude... I probably couldn't. I dunno why either. I just don't like girls darker than me. It's like dating a whole [expletive] (assume what it is)."" He's not light-skinned at all, keep in mind. He's somewhat on the darker side of brown-skinned, I'd say. I asked him, as a follow-up question, if he would date a black girl at all, to which he replies that he has, but that she was significantly lighter than he was. He made a remark about lightskin girls, and although I can't remember what specifically was said, it was something along the lines of, that he would 'accept' lightskinned or mixed girls. They aren't his preference. I made no judgmental remarks about anything he said and didn't throw judgment his way.

The last question I asked him was a bit nuanced, and I made sure to phrase it in a very specific way. I asked him if he would date a girl that had very black features; wide nose, lips, stuff like that. He, once again, stopped to think about it, and actually had a moment where he was deep in thought. He followed the silence with, ""No, I couldn't. It'd be like I was with a whole [expletive] (again, assume what it is)."" I pressed him on that, because he had some black features himself since he was mixed with black, to which he replied with, ""I don't know, dog. I just couldn't. That's just how I am, I don't know what else to say."" We eventually finished the conversation and went about working the rest of our shift, talking about either miscellaneous things or just working alone away from each other.

82,"I (23F) have been romantically challenged for around a year now for various reasons. I basically miss someone just constantly messaging me, or complimenting me, and constant flirty banter. It sounds so shallow to say, but there are biological perks to getting affection/attention.

I have the impression that a male friend has feelings for me, and the way that I’m thinking about him is that I don’t want that type of relationship with him at all, I’m just loving the attention. He is a great human and I would hate for someone to treat him that way, and here I am basically having those feelings. I have to pressure myself into not being that bitch, and I’m scared if I told anyone they would hate me for it. Justifiably so, because I’m hating myself for it. 

I don’t think I’m currently willing to actively search for attention somewhere else, but because I’m already friends with him, the devil on my shoulder is trying to sway me to turn a blind eye to me potentially hurting his feelings.

83,"I work as a first aid attendant on construction sites. A subcontractor so I get sent wherever needed. That’s it. I show up for a day and do first aid. Which means I’m simply on a site to wait around in the event of an injury. My job only extends to the fringes of preventative safety. Other than that I just hurry up and wait, which involves a lot of being on my phone or reading a book. 

The problem is some people don’t like seeing someone on a site not constantly working. So I get superintendents trying to turn me into a labourer or a housekeeper or just otherwise questioning my purpose. (And getting uppity at me about it, like the one at my current site). 

On the one hand, yes, I understand how it looks as a whole. But trying to say it causes resentment from the other labourers/tradesmen? Fuck off. That’s not my job nor do I care. I have my job description and I’m not going outside of that. If I do it’s as a courtesy because I’m polite or because I’m bored. If something is demanded of me in a bitchy way I’m definitely going to dig my heels in and NOT do that because I can. Because fuck you. 

This is honestly the first time someone has genuinely taken issue with me. Everyone else has been super chill, not really cared if I do something or not. Especially not housekeeping since that’s largely the responsibility of *everyone* on site. 

Suffice to say I’m not in a good mood and I’m definitely not coming back. I’ve been taken advantage of in my work too many times in the past to just lay down. I emailed my dispatch about it and man, even if they give me some kind of reprimand for making the company look bad, I don’t give a fuck.

84,"It is, isn’t it? I’ve been plowing through this situation by situation with added anxiety to the mix. I’ve been losing friends, and now I lost my long-term boyfriend of almost 8 years.

I knew it was my fault because he said so. I just didn’t have any idea why he chose to keep his hurt away from me knowing full well that I’ll do my best to help him and better our situation.

I’m depressed but I’m not some sort of robot that wouldn’t just care at all. I even decided to get help so that we could maybe have a healthier life together. So that I could help my parents deal with my shit too. But damn. Recently I had a breakdown. Life’s just too sucky for people like me, I guess.

I’ve been contemplating suicide for the longest time. Only now have I taken it seriously and it sucks because most of me would want to just end it. End all the pain away. I relapsed into cutting, I couldn’t eat, sleep, drink.. I just want an end to all of this. But my anxiety is shit and its making me steer away. Every morning, I wake up with the thought of suicide in my head. I wanted to buy a blade and sit on the kitchen floor and cut my wrists until I bleed to death. I just couldn’t handle pain any longer. I couldn’t vent out on twitter either (that’s what I do back then) due to the complications of what my ex’s friends would think of me. It sucks when you’re just trying to get your thoughts away but people who know you the less would judge you for it. It sucks more when the people closest to you would start to believe that judgement instead of you. Life sucks everybody. Try to learn how to love wholeheartedly and check on your people whether they are depressed or not. Let’s just hope I could gain the courage to get the freedom that I yearn for.

95,"How to Not Make Friends In College!

* come in with a false sense of security because you had a couple of friends in high school who initiated everything.
*     continue the illusion that everything will be okay by going to freshman orientation. everyone is so friendly! don't panic, this does not last; you'll eventually find yourself exactly where you want to be, alone while everyone else has found their place. keep telling your friends and family back home you're excited for college.
*     choose a difficult major! tell yourself (and those back home!) that you can't socialize as much you want anyways because your major is SO hard, pain is temporary and GPA is forever, ect. tell this to yourself until it's too late to go back or drop out. you're in this for the long haul!
*     try out the whole freshman dorm + random roommate thing. no matter how nice or well adjusted your own roommate is, your own dysfunctional ass will make sure that you guys stop talking after the first few weeks. if it's uncomfortable being in the same room as your roommate, just spend all you time at the library to ""study"" and ""totally not avoid having to confront my roommate about their music being too loud"".
*     WARNING: don't sit next to people in class! ends of the rows are choice, because that reduces the chance someone sits next to you by half. if someone does try to talk to you, don't worry. your one word replies will be off putting and push them away. worst comes to shove, just wear headphones all the time, the universal sign you are not friendly and/or likeable.
*     your professors and TAs can be your friends too! never go to office hours.
*     okay, you made it through freshman year with no friends and that's great and you can continue all these tips so far.but if you still feel guilty about being a hermit, you try AGAIN with random roommates. but this time have two. oh no, does this mean I may have double the friends? you sick dog, don't fret so much! you will once again not be able to stand the awkwardness of living with strangers and will be too scared to leave your room because one of the roommates is always sitting in the living room watching anime and screaming at his friends on x-box. ( FUCK YOU [redacted] ). also don't ever cook in the kitchen unless it's 5 am and you're sure your roommates won't be up. starve and get anemia induced depression, which will enhance your ability to avoid people.
*     you'll feel like shit if you don't at least try to join clubs. every semester tell yourself you're going to change and show up to the first meetings of a few organizations. enjoy the free food! wow, these clubs are pretty social and intimate! maybe you could really make friends here... but then (this step is critical) get cold feet! start thinking about how everyone is much more mature and cool then you. repeat this chant to yourself: ""I am lame and have never been drunk or done drugs and am also a virgin AND, no matter what anyone says, I will be judged harshly"". every interaction will end up being jarring and painful and you'll eventually be too embarrassed to keep going to meetings. &gt;italian chef kiss&lt; voilà, no friends. not going to the 'club fair' out of fear of another panic attack like last year is extra credit.
*     realize you are a liberal atheist fuck and somehow chose one of the most conservative colleges out there??? paranoia and secret, undeserved resentment of your peers will make you even more inhibited around them.
*     starting your junior year you can finally live alone, probably somewhere dumpy and sad. ""yeah I tried roommates, just didn't work out and I prefer to be alone"" yeah right buddy 😉. with that comforting lie in place and all hope for other avenues for making connections gone, you can safely sail your last two years in Total Isolation. if you only study (alone) and never get out, the days will blur nicely together. maybe you'll fail a class or two and delay graduation by a semester but either way your friendless college experience will be over before your know it. all you have to do is never EVER think about the regret of missed social and professional opportunities. who cares if you wanted to go to football games or do undergraduate research? shove that shit way way way way way way down.
*     you may think about taking on some wierdo incel or red-pill mindset. DON'T DO THIS. not only are you better than that, those people could also somehow end up being your friends
*     unfortunately you will get lonely and have cabin fever. going months without socializing can really take a toll! here are my top tips for that:
 1.  squeeze as much socializing as you can out of team projects and other scenarios where you have to talk to people for school or work.
 2. form a GroupMe with high school friends, just in case you guys start to care about each other again. you can also cyber stalk other people from high school for that nice hit of familiarity.
 3.        reddit

102,"(Posted this elsewhere, but posting it here too.)

Throwaway, in mobile, yada yada yada. 

Hey, I don’t really know where else to put this. Basically this is a really nuanced situation with a lot of different aspects to consider. I’m asking for advice, but I also just need to get this off my chest. 

I have a crush. Yes I am 16, yes I’m a teenager, yes I know this happens to almost everyone. I just have never had a lot of luck in the past with crushes. When previously I liked someone, it always failed. One crush said I’m ‘annoying’ and that I ‘talk too much’ (which granted is probably true, but still). Another one admitted to my wingwoman that he had a crush on her when she was trying to help me out. Those both happened when I was 14 newly 15, so over 18 months ago. Since then I haven’t really had any feelings for anyone. 

Until recently. I don’t ever get complimented on anything other than my academic skills. However, the other day I got a compliment totally out of the blue from a boy, I’ll call him Zach. Zach doesn’t really speak to me, as we aren’t in any classes together or anything. However, we used to be closer in middle school, although we were never close to best friends. Anyways, Zach randomly told me in the hallway that he liked my hair, and specifically my hair color. Now I have a very love-hate relationship with my hair, so this means a LOT to me. 

Of course, because I am a teenage girl, I’ve been obsessing over this a bit. Although the more and more I think about it, the more and more I am crushing on Zach. He is totally my type: geeky, nerdy, passionate about what he loves, and confident. Yes, I realize that this is high school and in the grand scheme of things there isn’t any way we would get married (I’m not even sure I want that with him!). But these feelings are very real to me right now. We also don’t have too much in common, although we do have a few things. 

I am a big believer in the fact that girls should take initiative. You like that boy? Ask him out! And considering homecoming is right around the corner, I would love to just get up the courage to just ask him. 

Here-in lies the problem though. There are rumors flying around that he might be gay. I go to a very conservative Christian school where being gay isn’t exactly okay. I refuse to put someone in a position where they feel they need out themselves or endanger themselves in order to explain themselves. 

There are a lot of people that have previously thought me and Zach should date. He is aware of this fact. Zach can not possibly be oblivious to the fact that he has rumors about him floating around. I don’t want to put him in a position where he has to choose anything suddenly. Maybe my anxiety is just really really abnormally high, but there are a few outcomes, even fewer of which are good, that come from me asking him to homecoming. 

1. Zach is not gay, likes me back, accepts, everything goes smoothly. 
2. Zach is not gay, does not like me back (was just being nice with the compliment), accepts anyways to save face/keep rumors at bay, is unhappy
3. Zach is not gay, does not like me back, does not accept, everything is okay
4. Zach is not gay, does not like me back, does not accept, rumors continue to fly anyways and it gets bad
5. Zach is gay, accepts to save face/keep rumors at bay, is unhappy
6. Zach is gay, does not accept, no one bats an eye, everything is okay
7. Zach is gay, does not accept, everyone freaks, he gets outed/put in a dangerous position 

As you can see, in my 7 possible scenarios, only 3 end up with things okay (#1, 3, And 6). I am aware this all is in the mind of a hormonal 16 year old girl who is probably WAY overthinking a very simple compliment. (I am also aware of the possibility of Zach being attracted to more than one gender, considering I am myself, but in my school that’s almost worse than being gay, so put those ideas where you will in my list.)

At this point, I don’t know what to do. I just want to know something rather than be trapped in this area of limbo where the ball is in his court, and I don’t know if he knows that fact. 

He Reddits, I know that. Hopefully he doesn’t come across this. There was so much more backstory, but this is the most relevant info. I also don’t want to put in too many identifying things. 

Help? Either support or advice, or a harsh dose of reality if you think that’s what I need. Thank you. 

TL;DR: I have a crush. He might be gay. Help?",06Sep2019,2

 My job considers me and my 7 team mates ""temp- employees"" - even though at least 4 of them have been there for 7+ years.   
 Because of that, the only benefits we have is shitty health insurance.  
 We start getting vacation days (paid) after TWO YEARS. But, after two years, you only get two days. After 3 years, 3 days. So on and so forth.  
 We work every other weekend, which means I work 12-13 days straight before getting 1-2 days off in between.  
 After 2 years, I can start working towards collecting longevity checks. After you work a certain number of hours you get an extra 40 hour paycheck.   
   
 My boss constantly asks for overtime.   
 When I first started, I was all about it. I had such a good work ethic, and I actually cared about my job.   
 My boss had me working 12 hour days for the first 6 months of my employment.  
 Oh, did I mention that I'm on third shift, as well?  
 I got burnt out on the overtime QUICK. I felt as if my good work ethic was being taken advantage of, with no praise.   
   
 On top of working my ass off for every second of my life, I am set up for failure every day when I walk through those doors.   
 We are supposed to have procedures on every job we do.   
 We don't. But when I fuck something up, I get blamed.   
 I am given procedures with the wrong information constantly. Or things will change, but no one cares enough to change the procedure, so I fuck shit up that way, too.  
 And not only do I get yelled at like I'm to blame, but people doubt my work now.   
 I am given the wrong information by my employers, and it makes me look like I don't know how to do my job.   
   
 But something more specific I want to take about -   
 my boss asked me on August 13th if I could work 12 hour days starting tonight, September 6th, to September 13th. I told her then, no.   
 Not only do I not want to, but my boyfriend uses the car we share for work every day, and he doesn't get home for 2 hours after she wants me to be at work.  
 So, I tell her no, and she schedules me anyway  
 THEN had THE BALLS to email me today and say, ""Your team doesn't seem to have very much faith in the fact that you're going to show up for the early hours tonight and next week"".   
 LIKE NO SHIT. They have every right to believe that.   
 I told them that myself! Just like I told you!  
   
 AND - ICING ON THE CAKE HERE BOYS -

 The very next day, she asked me to come in and work another 12.   
 So fucking insensitive.   
 I'm over it.  
   
 I've been looking for a new job for months.   
 This job pays me well. And it's really tough to find another job that's going to pay me a similar wage, with no experience elsewhere.

Boss man isn't thinking properly... Plus not to mention we wear short sleeve buttoned up shirts that have the company logo. Those types of shirts with a sweater vest? How does that look professional? 

I can understand if it was with the long sleeve shirts that don't have any company logo on em and it was winter but for summer? You got to be kidding me. We'd probably burn out due to how much we move about. I know I would.

Hope my boss knows these types of sweater vest hold in heat.",06Sep2019,3

116,"So generally, i’m not a fan of school itself, but i somewhat enjoy the fact that i’m surrounded by people. I don’t have to talk to them, but i’m just glad i’m part of the community in a sense. i also consider myself as a more leaning sided introvert because I’m a tad shy and new interactions make me go outside my comfort zone. However when i get home, It’s quiet. I feel left out. Sometimes i get home and just go sit outside just not to be inside my house. Usually right after school. However there are days when All i want to be is home by myself. I don’t know where i’m getting at this but i’m really curious for a explanation on this matter.",06Sep2019,1

I spend almost a whole week working closely with someone and I didn’t even knew her name because the moments he was introduced to me my brain decided “I don’t need this information, I’ll just throw it away”

It always happens to me...",06Sep2019,3

120,"I’ve been losing motivation, energy and focus for the past few years and it’s getting to the point where I’m struggling to complete even the simplest of tasks. Procrastination is at an alarmingly high level, my social skills are worse than ever and I’m becoming more selfish and self-absorbed by the day. It’s like I just don’t care about anything anymore and I feel like I’m most definitely unpleasant to be around.

What are some things I can do to bring some positivity, motivation and happiness back into my life?",06Sep2019,7
122,"So it went something like this:

------------

I mentioned the thing about Trump sharpieing the map

Mom: fake news

Me: Yeah you think everything negative about Trump is fake news because you think he can do no wrong

Mom: You liberals think everything is a conspiracy theory. You think qanon is a conspiracy theory

Me: Qanon is a conspiracy theory. It's the dumbest thing that I have ever heard and the people who come up with that stuff are smoking something

Mom: Do you even know what it is?

(TBH I don't know too much about it because I only read part of a RationalWiki article about it)

Me: Some idiot wants Trump to declare martial law and become a dictator

Mom: hahaha you don't actually know what it is

Me: If the Democratic politicians actually we're pedophiles then they would be in prison

Mom: No. It's about Hillary Clinton's husband running a human trafficking ring with Epstein

Dad: Do you care about Bill Clinton?

Me: no, he's irrelevant

Dad: You care about Trump when he does bad stuff but you never care about Hillary...

Me: Hillary has never been president not is she running right now

Dad: I don't think Obama has done too much sex trafficking but Bill Clinton has and he was the president

(Stuff happened that I couldn't remember)

Dad: Like, don't you care about the Democrats...

Me: I don't care because they're a bunch of centrist goons

(Stuff happened that I couldn't remember)

Me: I seriously sometimes want to use parental controls on the cable to block Fox news

Mom: Qanon isn't on Fox news

Me: because even the dumbasses on Fox know better than to believe that shit

(Stuff happened I couldn't remember)

Dad: I like this. I get to know exactly what spin liberals put on everything

(Stuff happened I couldn't exactly remember)

Dad: Who would you want to be president?

Me: Bernie

Mom: hahahahaha he's a socialist Communist

Me: He's not a Communist

Dad: Trump made the unemployment rate Soo low...

Me: But people are still under-employed

Mom and dad: hahahahaha

Me: People who want full time jobs still only get either part time or seasonal

Mom: Okay, the increased employment is just seasonal and part time, okay.....

(Stuff happened I couldn't exactly remember)

Me: I seriously think Trumpism is a cult

Mom: You're in a cult

123,"for the last 3 or so months i have had thoughts about whether i might be gay or not. when the thought first popped into my head it shocked me as this is something thats never popped into my head as the fact that i'm straight has always been a given. the thoughts might have started when the first time i tried to have sex it wouldn't go up or maybe its due to my porn addiction catching up to me (idk i heard porn can do this to you). ive had thoughts such as; gay images in my head, thoughts that i want to be gay, thoughts that i feel gay, thoughts that girls dont attract me, thoughts that i was always gay and just didnt know it or that i was hiding it. it caused me to look back at every single interaction ive ever had with a male and even if i look back at an early childhood memory and realise yh what i was doing was kinda weird, before these thoughts u jsut brushed it off, now its like its trying to convince me that it meant something and that ive been gay all along.these really messed me up but over time i have tamed the thoughts a bit but they seem to come back. eventually i decided i need to see a therapist because its having a bad affect on my life. she listened and told me i have an anxiety disorder which is causing intrusive thoughts and compulsions and obsessions. but the issue is when it first started and i went to her it calmed me down soooo much but its like ive had this thought in my head 24/7 for so long now that its like i believe it and it doesn't stress me out as much, i stress when i realise im calmer. ive only ever found girls sexually attracted, all my childhood and teenhood crushes have been girls and the one incident when i was young which the thoughts are telling me is me having a crush on a boy, when  i spoke to my therapist she told me thats something different and more of me looking up to them, but its like im now having thoughts that shes made a mistake or that i didnt explain myself fully and that if i did shed tell me in in denial and im gay. and its tough because even if i find a feature attractive on a man which im told is completely normal, before it was always the thought of i want to be like them, or have that feature they have now my brain is telling me im sexually attracted to it and its really hard to dismiss it as anxiety because a part of me genuinely thinks its real now or that i dont want to be with a girl anymore. sorry for this being so long i just wanted to get it all out there the best i could. if anyone could help or has experienced something similar id really appreciate the help.",06Sep2019,1
124,"Hello guys, I'm here to share you my story and I need your advices. I really sorry, if my English is bad, its not my native language. I was dating a girl that I like for almost 3 years. First year was perfect, we loved each others, but sometimes I saw that she is not as other girls I dated before. She had a continuous depression for almost whole her life. At first, she didn't tell me anything about that, but I felt that something wrong. After a year of relationship, the ship started to happen. She became hot-tempered and be jealous of absolutely everyone, right down to my colleagues. She had only one friend and they saw each other once per 2-3 months. So the whole time she was going out with me, cuz she wanted to. We often had quarrels, our relationship has become like a swing. I couldn't break up with her just because I got used to her, and I realized that if she would be alone, she might commit a suicide. I never wanted to hurt her feels but at that time I sacrificed myself. I started to have depression time to time and etc. It could be a long story, but now something happened to her. She started texting like her wish is to die and I can do whatever I want now ( go home later, go out with anybody etc.). She said that she loves me but she don't wanna hurt me with her depression and want me to forget her like we dont know each others. Also, she said that she no longer would be alive and that would damage me if she dies. I tried to explain that I love her and don't wanna give up. But she don't listen to me. Please, Reddit, help me. I don't know what to do, I don't want to loose her, but I could not control her, we are not living together. What should I do? Listen to her or try to normalise everything? (it is almost impossible). Sorry for a long story, I tried to shorten it as much as I can.",06Sep2019,1
125,"I mostly wanted to do it because it sounded fun, I guess I didn't because no one would read? I'm not entirely sure. That's the irony. My memory is terrible and actually won't stop getting worse due to 1. Brain damage. 2. Brain surgery. 3. Depression.

Now I wish I could read the autobiography. Would come in handy since most of my memories are gone or too foggy to really remember what happened. Yet another to add to my list od regrets :/",06Sep2019,2
126,"I broke up with her about 7 months ago, but I keep having second thoughts and start wishing she was still in my life. I heard she’s still not seeing anyone... Should I just reach out and say I’m sorry?? 

We broke up because we were working together, but we’re not in the same department anymore... it’s like we never settled those old problems, but now they might be irrelevant? 

Should I just keep moving forward, not looking back, even though these memories keep haunting me? I don’t wanna swallow my pride and beg for her back, but then again, it really fucking sucks being alone",06Sep2019,2
127,"Ahh I've been so thirsty for the last week. Doesn't matter what I drink how much I drink or anything. I'll drink and be thirsty within 3 min.

128," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look at my hair funny in a wtf face if I had it styled or just untouched is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",06Sep2019,0
