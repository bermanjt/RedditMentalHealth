0,"I wasn‚Äôt sure the subreddit to post this, but I am directing this to women. The backstory to the question; I was shopping at a wal-mart, cruising around and checking stuff off my list. As I turned down an isle, I noticed a female shopper and my jaw almost hit the floor. This women wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhot‚Äù as most men would say, she was drop dead gorgeous!! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è my question, how do you not come off as a creep to compliment her beauty or do women not like that, and as a man, you just have to respect her beauty and move on?

1,"So I got a meeting notification for a meeting in a couple weeks with my boss's boss, my boss, and my only direct coworker. 

Necessary background: I won't say what line of work I'm in to protect my identity. They are selling off my part of the business but it's a very long process and the majority of it won't be sold until 2021. Until then, it's mostly business as usual. Upper management has been pretty clear that we will all still have a job in the area but they don't have a clear plan for us. More figure it out and look for positions that open up. Also, there are two current open positions in a close area that match what my coworker and I do exactly, just in a different place. 

So anyways, on to the meeting. I get this meeting invite which is very unusual. I ask my boss what it's about and he asked and was told we would find out. My boss then tells me that he has a meeting with his boss and then all the boss's that are at his level after that and then our meeting. Something is really going down. I had really wanted to take this day off so I email my boss's boss asking how important it is and he says it's very important but I can call in. 

So what do you think is up? Are we all fired? Are they merging us with someone? Are they freezing our spending? Are they forcing my coworker and I to the other place?",22Jun2019,2
2,"it all started with an std scare last year and its just stuck around. its taken so much out of me. its also helped me. im down 40 lbs and up a lot of muscle mass. i just hate the constant worrying, the constant questioning of reality. is this red really red why does the color look like this, why does the sky look this shade of gray. are the headlights super bright? why does the room look weird. 

ive done all the tests humanly possible and all ive gotten is anxiety or i could have had vertigo. im tired of feeling this way. i wish i could go back to old me. 

i wont let it take my life from me, ill still keep being the best version of my self and aiming higher each day. i just hate the lingering feeling of it being here. to anyone else feeling like whatever they have today has claimed their life, it hasnt, you are in charge and like you i hope one day we will reclaim it.

happy friday everyone",22Jun2019,1
3,"I have this thing where I can never be sad about something for too long. If I'm at a low point I would randomly just starting thinking ""it's alright"" and I would start to feel hopeful. I hate that. I hate that because everything is good at one point, then the next point everything is ruined and I'm back to being sad and negative. Then next thing you know I'm hopeful again, then the cycle continues. Hope is the only thing helping me go on. I know I should be grateful for that, but  sometimes I wish I was never born at all. 

Sorry if this doesn't make sense, I just wanted to rant.",22Jun2019,8
4,"I love my small boobs. Its kind of ridiculous that i‚Äôm 20 and just now starting to love a part of my body that has been with me since I was 14. It took so long to get to this point and that is largely because of how beautiful women are always portrayed as voluptuous and curvy in order to be feminine and attractive to men. Even my own friends and family would make subtle comments about how small boobs are ‚Äúnot desirable‚Äù. Well I fucking love them and would never change them if given the opportunity. I wish younger me had the courage to love myself and not put myself down for not looking like all the other girls. If young girls are reading this and felt at all the way that I used to, love yourself in whatever form you walk the earth in. You are no less than anyone else because of a bodily feature. You are worthy of anything and everything you desire and loving yourself is the only way to truly realize this.",22Jun2019,36
5,"Ok so I‚Äôm at fort lee and I‚Äôm not allowed to go off base. Everything costs an arm and leg on base so I was thinking on getting stuff off base but again, not allowed out and shit expensive. 

I use doordash a lot and I got the idea of contacting one of my previous doordash delivery persons and offering money in return for them to pick up a few things off base and delivering em. 

So, I was wondering if the contacting them for this type of request would be considered weird (well duh it would be weird but would it be the creepy weird type?)",22Jun2019,4
6,"I'm in my early 30s. My friends have significant others and families of their own to care for. All at once, I've become fairly isolated. Instead of getting bitter about it, any time I would text a dumb joke to one of them, I instead record it in a text document on my phone. Same thing if I just need to vent. Venting there is especially helpful because it allows me to still get it off my chest but I don't have to burden someone else with larger problems",22Jun2019,4
7,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but I need some social advice and figured this might be the best place to ask. English is not my first language, things may be a bit foggy every now and then.

Background info:

I am 16M and have been diagnosed with light autism. I was bullied in elementary school (between age 8-11) and I have a PTSD from it, which I have had therapy for. Also important to note is that I'm not suicidal, I just feel alone and like a bag of dog shit.


I don't know how to hold a normal conversation with someone without there being awkward silences or saying things that for them seem very random. I just think through on whatever subject we are talking about and some things cross my mind and I just say them. I then just get weird looks  or people laugh but I just don't know why. This is why I am often alone, at school I usually only say something if someone asks me, and it happens that there are school days that I don't speak to anyone at school. I don't see my friends a lot, usually once a week perhaps. It just makes me want to cry that I can't socialise as well as other people.

I know other people have their own issues too, but I just want to be able to think and act like a normal person. Even though my family loves me and I have really nice friends, I still feel lonely.

I had a crush on a girl in my class and I really liked her, but I barely knew her and I didn't start a conversation because I was just too afraid to mess it up somehow. Same goes for making friends or just chatting with someone in class. I am too afraid that I screw up and people start to dislike me. I don't always know if it is the right moment to say something, if it's socially accepted behaviour, or I just don't know what to say or what to talk about.

I really want to improve my social skills and I want to feel better because at the moment I just feel alone. I feel like I'm just 'that weird guy'. I hope you have some advice for me.",22Jun2019,2
8,"So in 4 days, I turn 21. I‚Äôm at school for the summer just working so I can pay rent. All my friends are gone for the summer. I know I have friends and all but it‚Äôs just going to be a lonely birthday. Currently my only plans are to come home after work and do absolutely nothing. I want to cry and because birthdays are suppose to be fun. I figured at this point in my life, I‚Äôd have something good, maybe a girlfriend or boyfriend, or some close friends to hang out with me.

9,"

They‚Äôve pressed plenty before on whether or not I‚Äôm taking medication, why I‚Äôm not taking medication, if there is a way this can be fixed, and why I can‚Äôt get this fixed. 

I‚Äôve now had two managers ask me at work if I‚Äôm getting a procedure done so that my ‚Äúheart is fixed and doesn‚Äôt act up in the future.‚Äù

I never said anything of that sort.

I never said I was getting a procedure.

All I‚Äôve ever told HR and the store manager was that I‚Äôd be going in for my last rounds of EKG testing back in April. I wish I knew why all these managers were claiming that I was supposed to go in for some ‚Äúprocedure‚Äù when I‚Äôve never mentioned or spoke of anything of the sort. 

I‚Äôve explained how my tachycardia works. I‚Äôve explained why I can‚Äôt be on medication (they INSIST I should be put on medicine), and they still don‚Äôt understand that episodes just happen. 

They refuse to call my fianc√© as well. We‚Äôre getting marriage papers done early just so he can have better medical rights and more authority in these situations. He‚Äôs been my emergency contact since I started working for the company. Even if I‚Äôm incoherent and can barely speak they‚Äôll still force me to call him myself. I stutter real bad and can‚Äôt speak that loud during these so he‚Äôs barely able to hear me. They get annoyed if I tell them, ‚ÄúPlease call him for me,‚Äù and will retort with ‚ÄúYou seem coherent enough.‚Äù 

Mind you during these. I‚Äôm occasionally convulsing, shaking like a leaf, breathing gets hard, everything twitches, I‚Äôm rocking 150 beats per min (sometimes 200), I can barely move, my vision is blurred, and the second I start closing my eyes they‚Äôre already rolling into the back of my head. These aren‚Äôt common episodes. 


I‚Äôm very very done. Fuck I don‚Äôt even know what to think anymore. I called my docs office and she should be sending a thicc note in the mail regarding how tf my heart condition works and to contact her should they have further questions about my heart condition. If shit is still fucked after that I might take legal action. Isn‚Äôt pressing about medical records supposed to be illegal? Idk anymore man",22Jun2019,1
10,"Have you ever seen how a group of about 10 middle schoolers interact with each other? That‚Äôs how we act but 20x more sexualized and 10x more violent. And a whole lot more of goofing off.

13,"I've (F20) been with my girlfriend (F24) for about 4 months now, and overall, things are going great. 

Long story short, last week I noticed what I thought were mosquito bites appearing on my body, only to realize they might be bed bug bites. My mom and I proceeded to do a huge clean-up of my bedroom, just to be safe (vaccumed and steamed literally everything, and also thoroughly washed all my clothes). 

We didn't see any bed bug. But there is still no explanation as to what all those red, itchy bumps on my body are. 

I texted my girlfriend and asked her to check her mattress to see if she could spot anything (stains, etc.) I even sent her a picture of my own mattress with the small evidence I found there, as reference. She told me there was nothing in her bed. 

The sad thing is, I have a hard time believing that. I'm guessing she wasn't lying and did in fact see nothing, but I'm like, 99%  sure she didn't check as thoroughly as she should have. I love her but I know she can be lazy. 

Now, I'm scared to go back to her place. I don't want to question her and tell her I don't believe her, but I'm paranoid. And if the hard truth is that they do indeed have bed bugs, I don't know that they'll do anything about it. Most of the roommates are on welfare (including my girlfriend), and their place is kind of a mess. I really don't see them taking the steps I did and cleaning eeeeverything. My parents told me it would be the landlord's job to call an exterminator, but it would still leave them with a lot of work to do. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like I could offend her if I examinated her bed for myself, and if I do find the evidence I'm scared of finding, it would cause so much fucking trouble. But I can't just ignore it, either. 

If I tell her I don't wanna come over anymore until they do something about it, and ask her to come to my place instead, I'm still going to be paranoid about her clothes. And it's just annoying 'cause I live with my parents, so we don't really have the freedom to have sex and stuff. 

I'm like... going crazy about this. Maybe it isn't even bed bugs at all, but they're a common problem in the area where she lives, so... fuck.

18,"I don‚Äôt want to even use a throwaway because just don‚Äôt care anymore 

Today I came to the realization that mom hates me because of my anxiety. I always feel so afraid to do something because I never feel like I do good enough so I shut down and never gets done. I went to therapy for my anxiety for a couple of months before she said it was getting in the way of my job. And because of that things have only gotten worse and it doesn't help that she doesn't talk to me anymore because she is always with her boyfriend and the only times she comes home is to poke at me and trigger my anxiety because I didn't do anything. Being insulted by here became so normal to me that I would just expect it making a loop of anxiety that only made me fall deeper into a whole if just trying to bury everything. I became addicted to bring online because it gave me a place I could be someone better. I always was so happy just making other people laugh that I began to value it so much that when it was taken away all I felt was a horrible guilt that would last for months.

Today I half my stuff taken away permanently and it'll just be sold and for once I didn't get depressed but I got mad and finally told my mom how I really felt and what she told me was "" if you don't like, get emancipated"" and she tolf me this through text because she was at her boyfriend s house and she didn't want to see me.

I don't know if it's just that evey 16 year old feels like this but it just feels horrible that the only time I can be happy is when I'm someone else. Ot if everyone has that voice in their head that doest go away always saying that I'm never good enough for anything.

At one point I was so interested in doing things like law school. I guess I always just imagined being the hero who shut the villain away. It just always felt like it was the thing I was meant to do and then after an anxiety attack it was just gone. I've never been able to find a passion like that ever again and it been 3  years.

I always feel like it's just getting worse and worse and I keep hearing from people that it's worth it to live but it gets harder and harder to see it. I don't want to die but sometimes I just can't deal with everything.

I'm sorry if this is incoherent because yo be honest my hands are shaking because I realize that the only place I can be accepted and loved is a place where people will never know the real me who is just a sad sack if shit who can't do anything other than put himself down because I'm to much of a coward to do anything about it.

So please excuse me while I think about everything that is happening.

If I don't make an edit to this in about a month I probably have made my decision",22Jun2019,9
19,"Lets say for example I have the solution to a math problem. I know the answer and am the only living person that knows the answer. There was someone in my life 2 years ago that I had a falling out with. He was really rich. I never asked for anything and turned down gifts that I was given because they were too expensive. 

I clicked with this person because their family said that talking to me was like talking to them. We had the same childhood and interests. I was ridiculously loyal. They helped me discover that I was faceblind.

We sat down and talked one day about said secret. He explained that he would pay anyone millions if they could figure it out. I was never one to chase money at the time. I just continued the conversation about the topic and didn't really think ""I gotta get the millions"" I knew this persons closest secret and never told anyone, as part of the loyalty, after I figured it out. 

Skip about 6-7 months I go off to college. They appear on the campus. We talked on the street and such. Word got out that I knew such person and bam... Everyone stuck their nose in it. There was one guy in particular, who didnt like me. He decided one day to walk up to this person and come up with lies like, ""He talks about you to literally everyone"" and so on.. This hit a bumpy road in the relationship but it continued.

 I, being faceblind, was approached by the daughter of this person and she began to like me. I had no clue who she was so I kinda brushed her off and didnt think to much of it. She sat down at lunch one day after me telling her I had no clue who she was and began trying to talk to me again. She thought I was being mean and pretending to not know her for some petty reason. Again, im faceblind. She got upset and told him i was being mean to her. He immediately got pissed and approached me like ""What the fuck is wrong with my daughter?"" I explained that i didnt know who she was or even remember meeting her. Blah blah blah. Skip a little ways ahead, the guy who lied the first time, sits down and records me. He starts asking questions like ""So where there any whores at your school"" I said shit like ""Yeah she fucked like 3 guys at a party and filmed it then bragged about it."" He editted the recording and showed it... You guessed it, I was in trouble... Long story short I was beaten, raped and almost killed. I was told if they ever seen me again i would die.

Fast forward like 1 1/2 later, i figured out that secret he would pay millions for. I did it purely to keep me busy. There are people who he knows that knows i was set up, plus theres the fact that he knew I was faceblind. If I could get the chance, i could explain and answer literally every question. Im not bothered by the rape and all that. Honestly i knew he was hella overprotective, just didnt think i would ever have to worry about it.

Should I try and give him the secret in exchange for some money. There is a huge chance that i could die. But its a million+ dollars, which I was literally told was ""pocket change.""

TL:DR: Basically I was setup by someone on my college campus that ruined my relationship with a millionaire. I was raped and beaten. Told that I would die if seen again. There are people close to him that i could go to help plead my case. Should I go to these people so they can help explain shit and possibly collect a few million? What would you do?",22Jun2019,0

21,"Sorry for the bad title and probably terrible formatting I'm on mobile. Also sorry if this isn't the right place to post it.

I've been at my job for like 5 months now, I worked hard at the start because I was leaning and didn't want to fail my probation but after I passed my probation I started to relax and didn't work anywhere near as hard. I've now decided to stop being lazy at work and actually try to work hard. 

I've come to this conclusion because my father in law, god bless that amazing man, passed away earlier this year, the last conversation I had with him I told him I'd been offered the job, and he was so proud he started crying and telling me I'm going to go far in life and will do good things, I've never in my life had someone be so proud of me for something so small, so he's one of the reasons I'm starting to work hard, even though he's not with us anymore, I still want to make him proud. 

Second is my partner, we've been together nearly 4 years, we live together and have an amazing relationship and life together I would honestly be lost without him, he always tells me he's proud of me, but if I'm not trying my hardest at work then there's nothing for him to be proud of. 

Lastly, and it's silly but my dog, I would do anything for this boy, he may be just a ""dumb dog"" or ""pet"" to some, but to me he is my child, my baby and I love him with all my heart, every time I leave for work I tell him ""Mommy's got to go to work so she can buy you nice things"" I want my boy to have all the best things in life and want to pamper him.

24,"I check her social media compulsively almost constantly. I know which photos she's deleted, which ones she's changed the captions on and how many times. I ask our mutual friends about her at every chance and they (rightfully) think I'm obsessed. I've looked over everything she ever wrote or gave me dozens of times. Late at night I have trouble falling asleep because I'm thinking of all sorts of dumbass schemes to get her to talk to me. She hates me for choosing to end it and hasn't spoken to me since, save a few very short interactions. I know there's no chance of us working if we were to ever get back together because she has zero sexual attraction to me (did nothing but kiss over the span of a year and a half) despite having no problems with intimacy when it comes to other people before and after us, but I cannot believe just how much I miss her. I just want a chance to talk to her again.           

My current girlfriend has been incredibly understanding about my weird hangups, but I only feel like I'm taking advantage of her. I care about her so much but with my thoughts and feelings as scattered and conflicted as they are I know I'm not as committed to this relationship as I should be.

29,"Odd story, but here goes. I think fate intervened in my life and set me on the correct path. Now, i do believe in God, i recognize others don't but the coincidence is a little too much.

Throughout high school, i had always struggled with what i wanted to do. I always had trouble trying to figure things out. I kind of just drifted through, taking on whatever came up. But, after high school, i was mostly decided by my family that community college was the best option. 

I started there in the summer, i had a general idea of what my field was. But i just didn't feel it. I just didn't feel satisfied with my current choices.

It lasted for a year. And, really, i don't remember a darn thing i learned. My first semester was full of the average classes, Your maths and english's. My second semester was a little closer to what i had in mind, but it just wasn't feasible. I just didn't feel right, when i was there. There was an Accounting class that i was horrible at, there was this other class that i was no good at. Literally the only reason i even went was this girl.

I don't remember my teacher's. I don't remember the subjects. Nothing. This girl was the only thing i remember in any capacity. I had feelings for her, but i never really told her. Seeing her was the only reason i even bothered showing up anymore. I looked forward to it. I found myself waiting out the clock for class to be over, just to see this girl.

After the second semester came summer break. Towards the end, i also had to apply for next year and set up the funds. Now, being dirt poor, my courses (not counting books and material) were covered by a Pell Grant. The problem was, when i tried entering everything and submitting it, it never went through. I found myself waiting for days, but it just never actually finalized. I tried emailing the Financial Aid office but never heard from them. I don't know what happened, but the ""payment"" never went through, i never really got approved.

And it's a good thing too, 2 days before classes were supposed to start and the due date for applications was here. I had my accident. I fell, it was a horrible injury. Messed my leg up really bad. I was horribly depressed. I couldn't leave the house. I couldn't do anything. My life was stuck on hold. After a couple days, the due date came. Class started. The payment still never went through.

I honestly think that this was fate. Some form of destiny at play here. Because, 2 years later, i am in a different position from what i was studying for. It's not a normal job, but i make decent money now. Honestly, i was never meant to work in an office (my former career path). I was meant to be my own boss and work independently.

Nowadays, i don't really think about going back. It's almost as if i only went there to meet her. But now, my life is on a different path. I'm happy with how i am. I have no regrets about not going back. My only regret? Not confessing to that girl.",22Jun2019,1

31,"I have a 2.5 year old daughter named Marley. She‚Äôs brilliant and beautiful and loves with her mom 10 hour drive away in Utah, whereas I live Washington State. Our family moved to WA last June for me to pursue a Masters program to be more competitive with the medical school I planned on attending in WA. A couple months into my program my wife left me, taking my daughter with her because she has fallen out of love and didn‚Äôt want this demanding medical life anymore. At the time, I decided to finish my masters, and have FaceTimed Marley everyday since and have driven down a few days at a time once a month.

I‚Äôve recently been accepted into the medical school I wanted in WA, and I‚Äôve been so excited and happy about that. My mantra throughout this time has been ‚ÄúMarley and Medicine‚Äù, while everything else has been on the back burner. I‚Äôve recently had second thoughts though, about if me going to medical school is really what‚Äôs best for my daughter. I have no doubt there are opportunities and doors that will be opened to her that wouldn‚Äôt if I don‚Äôt continue with medicine, and I feel I would be much happy pursuing my long awaited dream of becoming a physician, but it‚Äôs precisely because I want medicine, I worry that I‚Äôm not really doing this for Marley.

Would it better if I came back to Utah and found another job so I could see Marley on a more regular basis?  I‚Äôm haunted by the idea that as Marley grows up she will one day ask me why I chose to stay in WA and pursue medicine, rather than move back to Utah so she and I could spend more time together.

Any insight would be appreciated. Thank you in advice.",22Jun2019,1

34,"I never truly knew my parents, I was raised by two of my uncle's and my aunt, all they told me about them was how they used to have a drinking and drug problem, I was fine up until late 2011 when they felt they couldn't raise me anymore so I went to live with my cousin and his wife and two kids.

I knew he was abusive from when I stayed there before but I thought he changed, turns out he was worse, he would constantly remind us of our mistakes, tell us how we would never graduate, and the physical abuse from dragging his daughter downstairs by her hair, to me getting pushed back into a computer desk, I couldn't pick myself out of bed for the next week at least, but once I did I left because I saw that me and his two children were becoming more like him the more we stayed, I told the police everything and at first they all denied it but then his two children came forward.

35,"English is not my first lenguage so sorry if I get mistakes.


So in my school every year 6th graders go to a camp at the end of the school year for 3 days. It has some things like a great lake, caves, outside activities and all that. Kids sleep in groups of 7 with a chaperone in a little ""house"". It is usually a great experience for sixth graders and everyone talks wonders about that, so naturally I was really excited.

I had my baggage ready for the camp 4/5 days before, I counted every single day until then. When It finally arrived I went to bed early and woke up REALLY early. It was as if I was about to explode from the excitement.

I got to school with a big smile on my face and almost wanted to scream when the teachers told us the bus has arrived. We all went to the buses and I suddenly realized no one of my small group of friends was there. I didn't really get along with anybody else in my class nor in any other class, so I ended up sitting in the front of the bus with all of the chaperones, just looking out and waiting for the 1 hour trip to end. I was a little sad, but I thought ""Well, the trip is boring but at least I'll have fun when we get there.""

We had some problems on the road since the rain had filled the road with mud and the buses couldn't go on without sinking if all the students were on, so we had to walk a little bit. At the end we took about 3 hours to get there.

When we finally arrived, I found out that since a friend of mine broke his leg the school got a mini van so he didn't have to be in a crowded bus. (They got there 2 hours earlier btw).He was also able to invite 8 people. We were 8 in that group but I guess somebody didn't want me there. 

Then it was time to form the groups. Since there were 2 girls in our group of friends, we ended up having a free space, which was taken by a boy from other group. He was mean, nasty and a complete dick to everyone, but we couldn't tell him not to join since we where the only free group.

Then something happened the first night but I'll save it for later since it's what I remember the most.

Since we had lost 2 hours, we had a really limited time for all activities and we wouldn't be able to do two of them.

One of them was the exploration of a cave. I was really looking forward for that one, but guess what? That dude with the broken leg couldn't enter the cave and we couldn't go without the chaperone, so I had to stay with him all the 45 minutes, some really akward and long 45 minutes.

Another one was to go down a giant waterslide that went down a little hill to a lake. At first I was really excited but then I really freaked out and ended up not doing it.

And another one was rock climbing (in a wall), which was cancelled due to a heavy rain. We had to hide under the wall (it was like a tall, shallow prism). We stayed there until the rain faded. And everyone just started doing dumb sex jokes which only made me feel uncomfortable tbh.

That night we had a disco/party, which I was able to leave almost immedeatly  with some other kids since some of us didn't like that.

And last, but definitively not least. What scarred me the most. I took with me dog plushie that one of my ""closest"" friends gave me on that year's christmas exchange. It helped me sleep. But oh boy, 6th graders (and 19 yo chaperones) can be dicks. When I took it out of my bag, one of my friends just snatched it out of my hands and started to act as if he was fucking it, when I tried to grab it he threw it to someone else and he did the same. My poor plushie ended up being ""fucked"" by everyone, even the chaperone. I wanted to fucking cry. 

I have the hope my sister doesn't have to pass through anything similar. She is kind of like me on personality, and she had the same hope and excitement I had. And I feel all that made it a bad experience was because of my timid and introvert personality. 

Sorry for venting, I just wanted that out of my chest.",22Jun2019,2

37,"I went to a bar tonight hoping to meet someone, or talk to any new person, interact with someone besides ordering a drink.  I milled around, sat at the bar, circled the place slowly, for a few hours.  No interactions.  Depressed and defeated, I decided to travel home.  On the way, I saw the sign for a strip club open until 4am. I immediately rationed why I wanted to go. I suck at talking to strangers, but what if they WANTED to talk to me. I could practice conversation with people I would NEVER be able to talk to (beautiful women....) and it would only take the effort of speaking on my half. I changed my taxi's instructions and there I was.  

I'd never been to a stripclub before, so I stood outside and mentally prepared myself. I googled dos and don'ts.  I unfortunately didn't have cash, so I took out $250 and paid a $10 ATM fee (holy fuck).

&amp;#x200B;

I sat at the bar and got my ""free"" drink. I stared at the floor for an hour and a half.  Women would do their dances and I'd hand them a few singles, never looking up.  A few of them came up next to me after making rounds, trying to make conversation. I shooed them away with a ""I'm not looking for a dance"" and a ""I'm just here for a drink"".  

&amp;#x200B;

Then one woman came up to me and started a conversation like no other did.  She just bumped into me and said ""hey, everyone says you're being shy"".  This startled me. I looked up and she tried to make conversation about my heterochromatic eyes...brown and green. She had the same eyes. I told her I was just there for a drink. She said ""you're drinking fucking costco water"".  She asked me to list three things I like about myself.  I just chuckled and couldn't answer. She decided to answer for herself and the only she could say is ""I'm sexy..that's it."".  Got my laughing again. She tried to list my three things for me...my eyes...my reserved personality...and I probably liked that she was sexy.

Again I just said I was there for water. That got her to go away, but her aggressiveness and persistence.  turned me on.  She made me feel desirable.  I looked around for her after she walked away, but I guess she went to a booth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then another dancer was on stage.  She stared at me, we definitely looked at eachother. Later she sat next to me, said she wanted to dance for me. We stared for a minute before I said ""why not"". For $170 I could go to a quiet room and get a lapdance and make casual conversation.  I gave the hostess the cash and then we went.

&amp;#x200B;

For the next 30 ish minutes, I was relaxed like I hadn't been in so long. She soon figured out that I had never been to a strip club before. I was enjoying, but not really focused on the lap dance. She danced on me for maybe 10 minutes before just sitting on me and giving me a hug. We hugged for the next 20 minutes and it was the best 20 minutes I've had in a long time. I forgot about being lonely or scared to talk to girls. I forgot about my career troubles or problems at work. I didn't even think about work. I drank the kool-aid as she said things to try and get attached, lines I am sure she has rehearsed for other people. ""You're too nice for this place"", ""why would you ever come here"", etc. When it was over she took me outside and told me not to come back, it wasn't my kind of place. I tipped her 45 bucks, gave another 15 to the blonde from before who got me out of my shell, and ubered home.

68,"So I've always been a quiet/socially awkward guy but I managed to land a prom date with a ""popular"" girl because she recently got out of a relationship. She's super kind and understanding, but she only asked me because we both didnt have dates. Over the four weeks before prom i couldn't even sum up the courage to ask for her number.

Prom day arrived and we went for photos, she did a good job not making me feel awkward taking photos and it was just a nice experience.

At prom after the initial dance, I kind of just hung around my friends, I was kind of acting like a bum because a slow song came on and I didnt find her to dance (I wanted to). By the end of the night after I hadn't seen her in a while, I noticed her on the stairs, but all I could do was watch. I noticed she grabbed her heels and ducked behind a curtain, but instead of going to check on her I just waited and hoped she'd come back out. When everyone started heading out to watch the fireworks I saw her walking towards her car but I couldn't get myself to say anything so she didnt even notice me standing there.

I got a message from her that she couldn't find me, wasnt feeling good, and left. I think she was still a little upset about her ex but I'm not sure. Either way I felt really shitty because she couldn't find me, and three times I saw her and didnt say a word. Kind of put a damper on the rest of my night.

I was hoping to see her at the party afterwards but never ran into her (she did go). This morning we messaged a little bit and I told her how much I enjoyed the day.

I really like her but I know she only sees me as a friend (maybe). I know i wasnt her dream prom date, and she looked like she was enjoying herself dancing with her friends, but i feel like i could have been a better date for her. Oh, and I'm crying.

72,"I am a 16 year old girl who is born and raised in the United States, my parents are born and raised in West Africa.

My entire life, I have never felt like I was an American. When people ask me where I am from, I will always say West Africa (sorry for not specifying the country, it is a less well known one and my sister is very active on Reddit and I do not want her to know it is me), not the USA. I see many other children of immigrants who are born here say they are from the USA, but I have never felt like this. I do not feel very patriotic for this country or proud of it, I never have and over the years my love for the country has only decreased, especially due to politics. I feel very strange to say that I am an American because it does not feel like me at all. 

I do not hate the USA, not at all! I would not even say that I do not like it, I just do not like being in it or being from it. There are many good things about it, so many opportunities, lots of beautiful scenery, each state has its own unique culture and values. I am actually quite happy to be from the state I am from and I do not think I would like to be from any other state, except Hawaii, which I adore. But at the same time, I wish I was not born here, and that I was born and raised in another country. I just do not feel like I belong here. If I were to stay in the USA, the only state I can imagine myself living in is Hawaii, because I really love more tropical places and ways of life.

Is it weird to feel like I am not American, or do not call myself American despite being it? I do not think I could ever do it when someone asks me if I am American, I say I am from West Africa but born here, I cannot just say yes because it does not feel right for me. I wish I was born and raised in the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, or in a South American country, is that weird? 

I am in love with Brazil and it's culture, and I am teaching myself Brazilian Portuguese. To me it is a beautiful country with a very rich history, and I love how Brazilian and African culture are intertwined. I know it is not a perfect country at all, I wish to be a humanitarian and I have read a lot about its social and political issues, but through the cracks, I see so much beauty in this country! For some reason I cannot do the same for the United States even when I try!  I really wish that I was born and raised there, rather than here, or maybe in Peru or Chile, although I know much less about those countries compared to Brazil. I do not know why I feel this way, but I feel if I were to live in Brazil for ten years,  I would feel more like myself saying that I am a Brazilian than saying I am an Amerixan, I know that is so weird and I do not want to appropriate Brazilian culture in any way, I am not sure why I feel this way.

I have never had many friends, at the moment I have none. I am quite shy and can be awkward, and I like a lot of very girly things like dresses and makeup, and also more ‚Äùnerdy‚Äù things like Zelda and Pokemon. I was bullied as a kid and I am not from a great family, currently, I am often ignored in school or just seen as the ‚Äùnice girl‚Äù or the ‚Äùquiet girl‚Äù, so this aids in helping me to feel like I do not have anyone or anything. Now I do not think being born and raised in another country would have solved these problems, I most likely would face the same problems in any other country, but I do think that having pride in the country I am from would help me to feel as if I have something I belong to. 

I do feel like I am West African and that I belong there but at the same time I cannot speak my language at all, I really do not like the food, my family often calls me American as a joke because I can only eat foods from the USA or other countries, but never African food (except jollof rice!) and I apparently don't act like a typical African girl, being very shy and sensitive, and quite emotional. 

I am sorry this post was all over, it was more of a rant than a question, I hope that someone could sympathize with me or give me some advice!",22Jun2019,2

83,"5 years ago I got to know a girl that I instantly fell in love with. She was smart, she had a good personality, she was beautiful. However, she had mental health issues and during our friendship I called an ambulance for her multiple times when she tried to commit suicide. After the 3 years of friendship we began dating and it was my first relationship ever. We went on vacation to multiple countries and the whole relationship felt like an adventure. 

But I have social anxiety and she might have mental health issues too, but she always wanted to go outside more and since I didn't want to we had to compromise. We went out from time to time, but we also had our calm tv-show evenings. 

Then after 2 years she met another guy. He was really extroverted and loved to do things outside all the time. They met up, again and again. 

After a few weeks she told me she is thinking about breaking up with me. I knew what the reason was, I just couldn't keep up with her motivation to do things and the other guy was able to do it. So out of panic I tried to throw ideas at her. How about we make a vacation to another country today ? How about we go playing paintball right now ? How about we do this and that RIGHT NOW. I just wanted to appear spontaneous and extroverted. And she actually agreed that we can go watch a movie at the cinema. 

It was a nightmare. Even during the car drive I tried to make jokes, I tried to make her compliments, I tried to show her how much I love her. But she just gave me the cold shoulder. No kiss. No hug. No laughing. She wasn't even really talking besides ""yes"" and ""no"". 

After the movie she was in a better mood, I thought I may have done it. She looked in my eyes and I was expecting a kiss or something but instead she just said ""You know what ? I remembered why I wanted to break up with you."" And that was it. I cried infront of everybody and the relationship was over. No contact anymore, she pretty much ghosted me and after a week her mother gave me my things back. I never even got an answer to the reason she ""remembered"".

That was 8 months ago and since then I tried to become better, to ""win"" her back. I studied hard and I'm now studying medicine. I worked out a lot. I educated myself about various topics. I did so many things. But everything I did was for her. So every few days/weeks I would ""stalk"" her on facebook. She posted nothing in the entire 8 months, so I thought she may be depressed and she might regret the break up. Today I went on her profile and.. she has posted a picture of her and the guy that she met up with back then and their first apartment together as a couple. 

Technically I didn't waste the last 8 months since I progressed a lot in life, but it definitely feels like I did. There was not one single hour or maybe even minute in which I did not think of her at least once. I'm so pathetic. Things will change from now on.",22Jun2019,2

85,"My ex and I broke up about a month ago. I know lots of people would say a month is plenty of time but this guy was the love of my life (or so I thought). In the past in relationships, I‚Äôve rebounded immediately and sought the validation of random men making me feel like I‚Äôm good enough. 

I have heard that my ex has been hooking up with girls and past me would‚Äôve taken this as a reason to go and throw myself at the first guy who would have me just so I could feel wanted. 

My ex and I broke up because I needed to work on my self esteem and steer away from only feeling comfortable in myself when I felt supported by others. Tonight was my first time out clubbing since we broke up and a couple of men who I thought were very attractive were approaching me in a suggestive way. I was tempted to a certain degree but I thought about it and realised that I didn‚Äôt really want to hook up with them, I was sort of hoping that my ex would see or that I would feel like I was ‚Äúeven‚Äù with him if I was hooking up with other people too. So I decided that these reasons weren‚Äôt good enough and that I was going to put myself first, for once.  I knew I would regret these hookups in the future and would just feel awkward and yucky about the situation (no shade to people who enjoy a casual hookup, I do too given the right circumstances).

Indeed, working in Finance is not what you would call a creative job. Also, giving selflessly to people and helping others is something I always found fulfilling!

To the surprise of many of friends, I decided to create a YouTube channel and shoot 3 types of videos:
- Crossing off items from my bucket list
- Talking about motivational/inspirational topics to encourage others doing the same
- helping in real life some selected individuals to reach a goal/dream

I already released videos about the 2 first points and I am working on 2 projects for others:
- Found a recording studio in London to help a gifted piano player, putting his video on YouTube, to get his first album out!
- helping the wife of a friend to start her dream flower business without her knowing (work in process)

I want to work on more projects like this and make it my brand, my niche!

I d love this r/self community to help me brainstorming on small projects, requiring only time and energy with a minimum initial investment, that I could do to help other people!

93,"My family had to unexpectedly say goodbye to our cat Kira. She was the sweetest, funniest, cutest little Siamese cat I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of meeting. The grief has struck us deeply, as these things do for all who experience this kind of loss. Going through the days and weeks since losing her has given me a lot of time to reflect on what happens when we lose a beloved pet, and I wanted to share them here.

We don‚Äôt know where we or our pets go when we die, but we do know what happens when a pet dies.

A pet is far from just ‚Äúan animal.‚Äù They are our family members, an extension of ourselves and our love and compassion reflected into one furry, sometimes endearing, sometimes challenging manifestation of all we love and put out to the world. In exchange for our love, they return it to us unconditionally, as if playing fetch with our hearts. And it‚Äôs in our hearts that they take up residency, as part of the purest, most innocent and limitless love that we are capable of. They give us joy, they make us laugh, they welcome us home and comfort us when we need comforting. They make houses into homes. They make us more joyous and loving and grateful for every day we get to spend with them.

But through it all, we know that each day is limited. We never know how many more times we‚Äôll get to play with them, to pet them, to share fun memories with them. And when the day comes when it‚Äôs time to say goodbye and for the first time the end is in sight with all of its tragic truths, all you can say to your pet is, ‚ÄúNow you know the secret. Now you know why we held on so close.‚Äù

In the end it never seems like enough, but at the same time what more did we have to give than what we gave them? After all, we had given them all the possible minutes, seconds, moments, hours that made up our life and our love with them until that wretched day when it all went away.

When a pet dies, who they are to us never ends. The love we shared with them lives on inside our hearts. Memories of them spill out across all the years or days that we knew them. All that love we gave and received in return overflows, rushing through us until it‚Äôs too much to bear but we find a way to bear it somehow and it all extends, pooling outwards into the great unknown expanse of where all unused or unfinished love goes.

Maybe they‚Äôre waiting for us there. Maybe even if they were, the feelings we felt and memories we shared wouldn‚Äôt quite be the same. Because if we and our pets could live together forever, would it really be the same? Or is our time with them all the more beautiful, compelling and tragic because we know that there is a cruel, unknown expiration date hanging over every moment we share with them?

How do you replace unconditional love? How do you fill the gaps it leaves in memories, in corner spaces and small moments? How do we keep alive what has passed on? We can let our love continue to flow, continue to share it with the world to embrace other animals in need ‚Äì to recognize in them their own unique flaws and beauty and appreciate them as their own furry bundles of endearment and challenges. We can give back in other ways, finding compassion and solace in trying to be just a bit kinder, just a bit more patient with the world around us. We can hold our memories close to us, keeping them alive in our hearts and knowing deep down that we were just a bit better of a person, just a bit warmer and kinder and happier for having known them, if only for a little while.

I know, and my family knows, that there will never be another Kira for us. But we also know that the love that we shared with Kira and the memories we had with her did not end when she left this world. That love is still here. It‚Äôs just a little further out of reach than it was before, if we can just extend our hands a little bit further, dig a little deeper and find it still close enough to hold.

I have always struggled with anger and depression, and as such ive had low moments where ive dramatically claimed i want to end my life, but where deep down i know i really do not want to, nor do i intend to. 

Nowadays, when i think of killing myself, it feels like an eventuality, not just a dramatic outburst. It washes over me like a foreshadowing instead of a conscious yet intrusive thought on my part.

People have always been coming to me for advice or to help solve their problems but now when I need someone to share my problems with there's nobody's here. It's frustrating because I feel I am constantly being pushed aside. I am made to not feel important and I feel this way everyday. I am ridiculed and made to feel stupid everyday.

I had genuine love but faked how much of it it really was. Why? Because they made me feel good in return. That was the sole purpose. All the friends I had... whenever and if I ever was a good guy.

This is another wall that I need to break within myself but have very little people to tell. Even now as I'm writing this down I'm doing it because I want my voice to be heard. Because my voice matters and I want you to hear it. No matter how shitty youe day was. I have to tell you. And i do it because I'm a selfish bad guy.",22Jun2019,18
104,Hello guys. Can you tell me what do you think about Netflix? I‚Äôm from Russia and it‚Äôs not such popular in my county as in USA or Europe. Is it convenience to you? Why do you like and use it?,22Jun2019,5
105,"Even when I was little I noticed I had some really uh, ‚Äúunique‚Äù genetics. My grandfather was addicted to smoking, my uncles were addicted to drinking, my cousins addicted to drugs, my dad addicted to working etc. I always knew I had an addictive personality or whatever you wanna call it. Few years ago I took one of those 23&amp;me tests and it just confirmed it. 

So, now I‚Äôm faced with a dilemma or more like me trying to keep myself from. A days ago my roommate was like ‚Äútry this‚Äù I was like I‚Äôm good. He was like no seriously. I was like no he was like I‚Äôll pay you 5 dollars to suck on it. I was like alright. So I got his stupid vape and ya. 

Well, it felt so.. relaxing and in my stress filled life it was amazing. Ever since that day I‚Äôve been trying to keep myself from getting one because I KNOW if I get one imma be addicted to nicotine in like second. 

Currently in MOS school (military) and I‚Äôm not allowed to go off base, they sell them off base but legit I‚Äôve been looking too much into them. I got the idea of getting doordash (like I always do) and asking the delivery person to pass by the gas station in front of the doordash thing and get me one and I‚Äôll pay him when he gets here. But holy fuck I‚Äôm like trying to hard to get my mind off of the stupid idea of getting a vape-.- 

So, tell me all the ways imma die if I get addicted :D pretty much just scare me shitless ty",22Jun2019,1
107,"I'm finally seeing my friends and family, working a lot, having fun, and making good money, and getting a new apartment.

So everything started last Saturday when I went to my cousin's high school graduation party, and I saw them for the first time in over 6 years. Seeing him and his brothers all grown up (one of them is also in high school) makes me happy, and I feel being re-connected with that part of the family after not talking with them very much over the years.

I'm also starting to make money, working 3 jobs this summer (though I'm planning on quitting one of them and just pick up more hours at my other 2 jobs because it's not worth the money for the hours I'm getting), so I'll be getting good hours and good money. In addition to the job I'm currently working, I started one of my other jobs about a month ago, and I've been working at the other new job I started for a couple weeks now, so I should be getting my first paycheck for that one soon.

I'm starting to make friends with my current and former coworkers at all of my jobs, and I keep seeing them when I'm working or going places. On Wednesday I finally decided to go out to a special comedy event at my city's local comedy club, and I saw all my coworkers from one of my jobs there. At one of my other jobs I keep seeing people I know there and I get to talk to them. It's really great. And now I finally got invited to a work party on Sunday, and I'm hoping to have so much fun there.

My roommate from my college dorm sophomore year finally messaged me after not having talked to him since the beginning of last summer. We caught up, and it seems like everything's going well for us. He transferred back to the school he went to freshman year, and he seems happy there.

I'm leaning on the decision to go back to college next fall, after initially deciding not to go back last April when I was stressed out over finals. I'm currently setting up my advising appointments for it after procrastinating for the longest time. I think I'm going to work full-time and only take a couple classes each semester, as I'll need the money, but I can't stress myself out having a full slate of classes and a part-time job.

Also, after searching for a new apartment for over 4 months, one of the people who I contacted early on finally messaged me, and offered to show me the room he's subletting after he moved out. I took a tour of the place, and I really liked his roommates! I'm going to contact him soon, and go through the process of signing the lease.

I'm also trying to update my wardrobe, and I bought new shoes to replace my old ones that are a year old and completely wore down. These ones I'm just going to wear on the street and not use them for work, like I did with my old shoes. I also bought a cheap pair of work shoes so I can wear those out instead.

I'm starting to go biking again, after not doing so since spring. I plan to do so at least once a week, if the weather's good and my schedule's not too busy.

For the first time since spring last year, I finally feel like I'm making new friends, and on top of that, I know who my real friends are, after leaving some of the more toxic ones.

I've been trying to fix my life up, and for the longest time feeling like a mess, I'm finally having my life together. There's a lot good going on for me this month, and I'm finally happy! I think I might also start dating for the first time, now that my life is turning around.

I think this might be the start to a great summer. Or maybe it's just June, but I'll take it. Anyway, June 2019 will be one of the most exciting months for me since I started college.",22Jun2019,6
108,"When I was a kid, I would often pretend that I was recording a voice memo on my ipod. I did this everytime my parents argued in the car so that they would stop. I did this mostly for my younger brother who would get scared when they screamed. Once they began to scare my brother, I would take out my ipod and pretend like I was recording everytime they argued, saying things like, ‚Äúthe date is XXXX and they are arguing again.‚Äù That would shut them up and call my brother down.",22Jun2019,537

114,"When I loved and lost at the age of 15 I was heartbroken; nobody tried to advise or help. It was as if I was just left to do my thing and I did.

I drank and smoked sniffed and took. Each and everyday for close to 11 years I would do anything to 'not be sober' each and every day - anything to take the pain of heartache away. By the time i'd reached 18 it wasn't really about heartache anymore i'd forgotten what she looked like, it was just drug addiction.

Nobody told me taking drugs was bad, nobody. Everyone just let me go about my business because they didn't want any trouble, didn't want to get involved. 

It was only once i'd tried everything in the book to cure myself that I realized there was last one thing i'd never tried - just stop taking drugs and live sober like a normal person. 

Taking drugs felt like the only way to feel normal because i'd lived in a constant withdrawl symptom state for my whole life. I don't remember anything before the age of 15, literally my whole life has been in withdrawl symptoms. 

I blame myself but I blame my family and friends so much more. They all knew what I was doing and just left me be, i'd understand if I was threatning but I weigh 9 stone / 126 pounds / 56 kg. I'm not threatning to anyone and I couldn't fight my way out of a kindergarden class.

My mother - she kicked me out 3 years ago and said it was because she was scared of the familys safety. Such bullshit, she just didn't want to deal with fixing a drug addict. My brother - i've been telling him for so long that i'm hungry, just hungry for some food, he says nothing it goes in one ear and out the other. My younger brother.. I am guessing has been brainwashed by my mother and brother to dislike me - we'll never truly have a relationship. My father... When I was homeless I rang my father and he said 'there's no room in my house' (or his three empty garages for that matter). My friends said it just wasn't their problem, it's right it's not. I'll never blame them as much as I blame my family.

Nobody told me taking drugs was bad, nobody. I'm expected to just know, right? 

Well sometimes people are just wrong. I didn't know. I'm not perfect. I was in pain and it relieved the pain. 

Now i'm sober and angry. 

If I was in an underground bunker and there was a big red button infront of me; pressing that button would wipe out civilization as we know it - I would hesitate. I'm not saying i'd press it, i'm not sure what i'd do. But I would definitely hesitate. I'm not evil, i'm just damaged by drugs and angry. 

I've been sober for a while now. Hard drugs I don't remember the last time, soft drugs a couple months. Not even a cigarette or a beer.

You don't have to reply, I just had no one to tell.

Today I finished my first day at a new job. I loved it.",22Jun2019,1
115,"My girlfriend and I are going to break up soon. She‚Äôs going abroad to study and I‚Äôm staying in my country, so we decided it was for the best. We‚Äôre slowly drifting apart and it‚Äôs so fucking weird and strange. We‚Äôve been best friends for two years and have been dating for almost 5 months and we barely talk now, she‚Äôs not there for hours at a time. But also, I don‚Äôt feel any romantic connections to her anymore. Maybe I do and I‚Äôm just repressing it or it‚Äôs way less than before. But I don‚Äôt feel like telling her that I love her anymore. I only feel like telling her that I care about her and that I‚Äôll always be her friend.

It feels like what I felt for her is crumbling down. I used to feel like she was the one and that she was perfect. I knew that rationally she wasn‚Äôt, but that was how I felt and I allowed myself to feel that way. But I don‚Äôt feel that way anymore and it‚Äôs fucking weird. It feels strange to not love her. I‚Äôve loved her for so long now. Months before our relationship started I was falling for her. And now I just don‚Äôt. I care about her but I don‚Äôt love her.

In the back of my mind I knew this would happen eventually. We simply didn‚Äôt have the same path in life. I went into the relationship knowing it was going to be for fun but that eventually we‚Äôd have to break up. And it‚Äôs weird to finally reach that point where it‚Äôs closer than ever. Where we‚Äôre drifting apart rapidly instead of holding on tight while we still can. 

Our relationship was never perfect. We never got to go on a date because her parents didn‚Äôt trust her and they decided to hate me without even meeting me because her ex was emotionally abusive. She also hasn‚Äôt healed completely over the trauma her ex caused. She would vent to me about how her ex mistreated her, and while it was therapeutic for her, it hurt me to hear how she had been hurt. Maybe I‚Äôm just selfish for that. I don‚Äôt know

For these reasons, I think that even if by some misfortune she lost all opportunities to go abroad and had to stay in our country to study, I wouldn‚Äôt want to continue our relationship. I care about her, but I want to move on with my life. Our relationship won‚Äôt evolve even if it could. If she stayed here her parents wouldn‚Äôt make it easy for us to go on dates, and I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd be willing to go behind their backs for me.

I was never a priority for her if I‚Äôm being honest. She always put her studies and university first, and I was there if she ever finished with her responsibilities. I guess that is reasonable, but that also means she never made the time for me. I‚Äôm over exaggerating, never is too strong of a word. But more often than not I went last. This is also partly the reason we never went on dates. She always procrastinated talking to her parents.

I don‚Äôt know what to feel anymore. The more I talk I realize I‚Äôm antagonizing her to make myself feel better. But that‚Äôs not the right way to go about this. I made a fuck ton of mistakes too. Sometimes I didn‚Äôt want to keep hearing how she felt and I told her that I couldn‚Äôt listen to it anymore, and I just told her that I hope she felt better and went to sleep. 

This just isn‚Äôt what Im used to doing. I‚Äôve been focusing on the good of this relationship so much and for so long that talking about the bad is strange. And it‚Äôs not like we never talked about the bad together. That‚Äôs what made our relationship so good. We talked. We communicated. But at the end of the day some issues went unresolved. Their resolution will be the breakup.

I just want to move on with my life now. I want to see what my future and university has in store. I want to stop feeling sad about breaking up with her. She‚Äôs still my best friend. I haven‚Äôt lost her. But I lost this connection to her. And no matter what happens I‚Äôll never be as close to her as I was in these past five months. And I‚Äôm sad about that. I hope I can stop feeling sad about that soon, because life has bigger and greater things in store for me in the future. I‚Äôll allow myself to feel sad while I have to. Eventually I‚Äôll keep my chin up and look forward to the future.",22Jun2019,1
116,"So for the past few montha i have been seeing this guy. He was my first legit gay boyfriend. Im out and he did come out shortly after we started dating. We didnt really get to see each other much do to the fact our work schedules didnt match up a lot and we live an hour away from each other. However when we did see each other i enjoyed every effing second of it. We didnt have sex, i wasnt presuring him into anything he didnt feel comfortable with. But i enjoyed his company. Just us sitting and watching a movie Or the hella hot makeout sessions. 

I was really really looking forward to yesterday i hadent seen him in a few weeks. We had made plans to hangout nothing in particular. So after work i hurried home power cleaned the house and got myself ready to see my man. But when i opened the door i could tell he seemed off. It didnt take long for me to ask what was up. And he started talking to me about it all. 

It wasnt bad or anything. It was just very sad. He did look like he was about to cry, but half way theough our talk i coudlnt really look at him, i just stared at my hands. I wasnt mad. I dont hate him. I get his reasons. I respect him for telling me. I just wish it didnt have to happen. I really liked him. He was the first person i actually gave a chance with in a while. But it was fun. I dont regret it. And i hope the best for him in life. 

Im just hella but hurt and needed to vent a little. Ill be ok. It always get ok eventually.",22Jun2019,1

119,"Warning: long post, and I'm on mobile so excuse the formatting. 

Since I was in middle school I've suffered from depression intermittently and lots of self esteem issues. It mostly deals with issues that I can't change in my life, such as height and penis size. I was always the shortest guy in my class, and it only got worse in high school as everybody physically completed their journey into adulthood.  Because of my crippling social anxiety, my height, hair loss, and penis size, I was invisible to women in high school, and didn't finally get a relationship or lose my virginity until I was 21.

That first real relationship gave me a confidence boost for a while, but the relationship was very rocky, and ended very poorly. Since then, I've only had a couple brief FWBs and many one night stands, since my view of relationships and women overall is fairly low. This problem only continues as I've realised more that the 2 key factors that women look for in a guy is height and penis size. While everybody has sexual preferences, I'm no exception, it's still incredibly frustrating knowing that women will never really want my physically. People say it's all about confidence, but it's hard to have confidence when the world is against you just for something you can't change. 

I'm lucky enough to have been born into a family that cares deeply about me, and I care about them. This becomes trying at times since both my folks are heavily religious, particularly my mom, and I'm not at all. They blame my lack of confidence on my disbelief, which just makes it seem like they really don't understand what's going on. I'm not intending to play the victim with this post, I just can't see how it's possible to build any confidence when I don't have any external validation for it. How can I possibly build my own self confidence knowing I'm not going to be able to enjoy some of the simpler things on life like love and sex? How can I like me for me, and be okay with being alone?",22Jun2019,2
120,"I met a guy off tinder, and we agreed to be fwb. 

The first time we met up, he took me out on a date and the night ended with amazing sex. He was so nice to me... kissing my forehead gently, holding me close, sometimes just looking at me and smiling... Our personalities mesh really well together and I feel so comfortable around him. 

I realized pretty damn quickly that I had feelings for him. We both agreed in the beginning not to have a relationship because we had just gotten out of disastrous relationships. 

Yesterday, he came over and we had a lot of fun. I told him that I had a crush on him, and that I was so used to relationships ending in disaster that I had already braced myself for the inevitable. He deflected a bit with humor. I said ""Just reject me. I need to hear the words."" So he did. He said he just wasn't looking for a relationship. I told him that was exactly what I expected. I said that I didn't expect anything from him, I just wanted to let him know that door was open in case he wanted more. He thanked me for my honesty and told me to let him know if I couldn't see him anymore. 

I am an idiot. I agreed to this. What did I expect? I am still foolishly hoping that he likes me. He looks at me like I'm something amazing, and gently kisses my fingers when we watch a movie together. But maybe he just treats all of his hookups really well. 

How stupid am I?",22Jun2019,3
