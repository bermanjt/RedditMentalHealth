2,"I just moved into college about a week ago. I’m attending a large state school about 1100 miles from my home town, and I just feel kind of alone in the whole process. My father, whom I’ve lived with for the past 3 years, never went to college and he just doesn’t know how to handle tuition bills or class enrollment or anything in that vein. My mother on the other hand has just been a pure asshole. Every time she gets on the phone with me, she speaks to me in the most condescending tone possible, and tries to downplay my success. One of her big lines is saying that if she never reported her income then I “wouldn’t be where I am today”. She believes that all the financial aid that I got was because of her, even though she hasn’t been involved in my life for the past year. Anyway, I’m paying for college all on my own (I’ve saved up all my money for the past 4 years), and I just feel really isolated. I genuinely feel like I have nobody to turn to or ask for advice, and nobody to vent to. I’ve been thinking of seeing a therapist on campus but I’m just not sure if that solves all of my actual problems.",12Sep2019,17

4,I have an 8 month subscription to medications for my depression and anxiety disorders. They were prescribed less than 2 months ago and I just have to go to the pharmacy to get refills every month. Only I moved out like a month ago and quickly ran out of pills and I have no idea how to transfer the 'scrips to the local pharmacy and even if I did I don't know how I would go pick them up or how I would pay for them so I haven't even tried and now I'm depressed every day and suicidal a lot of days and missing classes and there's no hope of ever getting better. Plus I have no friends who are close enough to care about me because my home is 18 hours away. So I'm kind of just fucked,12Sep2019,2
5,"I don't know, thinking about it now, it feels like for so long, I thought that my personal struggles and hardships were silently dismissed by all the people that could help me. Mostly the authority figures in my youth. Like if I were showing clear signs of distress, but was ignored.

Surely, that's happened to some extent... But I think about how much or how little of other people's lives I see. I think to myself ""the people around me saw about the same of me. Even if was a small amount of time **every day**, they probably were living their life and oversaw what I was going through. Maybe it really wasn't something they could see.""

I guess, that's how it was. And that's really helped me shine a better light on my experience with my parents, teachers, uncles and aunts. They all saw different things, and they just didn't happen to catch the things I was most hurting about.",12Sep2019,1
6,"I recently got out of a 7 month relationship where I thought everything was perfect, until an old friend came back into my life and showed me how wrong I was.
Turns out once again I was allowing myself to be lied to, manipulated, and used. I was giving 100% into that relationship every. single. day.. 
Yet I only received a good 1/4 of my love back, and only when it was convenent for my ex to do so.

So I broke up with him, after finally hearing what I needed and having 5 of my closest friends and family examining our conversations over text and agreeing that I was actually in a bad spot. 

I could never see a future with him in it, and I ignored all these problems as they kept popping up, hoping they'd just get better, but they all got so much worse.
The older our relationship got, the less effort he put in. He must have been so comfortable and confident that I wouldn't have left that he just stopped trying. The sad part is, it *was* working, I would still be with him for months, possibly even *years* to come if it weren't for this wakeup call.

The reason I fell for him and became so blind to the abuse is because of the abuse I went through as a child. I'm so used to just letting people use me for their benefit, being neglected and mentally tortured and still believing I love them for them.
I don't want to be a victim, or be so numb that I can't tell when I'm being hurt. I was being hurt, even though I loved him so much. I felt such a rush around him, I thought I had found my person, it all felt too good to be true. 
Turns out it was.

When I told him the news he blocked me on everything we were connected on, and I had no way to communicate with him. Right before he did it he wished me luck in the future and claimed he still cared about me, but still blocked me and rid me from his life just like that.
Someone who claimed they loved me everyday, that they didn't deserve me, that I was so out of their league and kind to them for no reason just disappeared at the first sight of me being done. I wanted him to at least want to talk to me? Is that too much?
He didn't try to fight for me, he didn't get angry, he was just confused and told me that if this is what I wanted, then he's okay with that. 

So I found another way to contact him, and sent him a reassuring message explaining the situation and how I should've found another way to talk about this with him. It's been almost 2 days, no response. He hasn't blocked me, but I expect it.

I'm so used to being abused that at times after the breakup I was willing to face him again, just to feel that love for a little longer, no matter how he treated me.
I'm so ashamed, I was subconsciously allowing myself to get so used to him and so addicted that one day I would never be able to leave.

I know he would've hit me one day, he has anger issues and though he claims he works on them, they don't get better.
I just know that if I stayed, there may have been physical abuse involved. I would relive my childhood of being hit and yelled at, I'd feel like that little kid again.

I want closure, I don't want him back. I don't miss him, I miss what he gave me and the good times we had, that's what I want back.

I'm just at the point where I'm desperate for love. I want him out of my head but I let him hypnotise me. Now I'm stuck.",12Sep2019,1

 I have my bachelor degree of engineering in my home country, i was excellent at school, but i have not had many contacts as i am from a poor family. After my studies, i have manage to find a contract from one of my professors. I worked for his engineering firm for 7 months. After the end of it, i tried to find another one, but no success. 

I said to myself why it has been so hard for me even all those efforts.  Cause it’s more than one year since i don’t have Job. On path to find solutions, i send my application to continue my master degree in Canada, as i have really good grades, I have been accept from 2 universities, the other part is for scholarship as i can’t afford to pay the big amount as international student. But again, Unsuccessful to find a scholarship.  

Trying to find jobs from my home country. Nothing. I don’t know why, but life seems unfair sometimes, even though i am strong sometimes, but i just feel down too. Maybe one day the light will shine. But how many days, weeks, years it would take?

14,"There's a blog post out there that I just came across recently and I want to address it in this post and get some external feedback on: http://carynschulenberg.com/tag/tickle/

I just think there should be at least one thread out there calling them out, because to me, this blog just looks like a narrow echo chamber of awful behavior being accepted.  And no one should be under the illusion that they're being ""dramatic"", have ""no sense of humor"", or are ""crybabies"" for speaking out against this.

I'll preface this by saying that tickling can absolutely be a healthy form of play-fighting between siblings, and done to extents that are enjoyable for all parties.  There's even some biological hypotheses that consider whether tickling is a left-over evolutionary behavior to teach small children how to defend against attacks in vulnerable areas (i.e. elbowing away attacks to the ribs).  I'm not saying that it shouldn't be done, and if one finds being tickle-tortured fun, then there's no problem with indulging him or her.

But that's not what this is about.  Many stories in the comments for this blog post take it to pretty cruel extremes.  I would say the OP of the blog (Caryn Schulenburg) isn't so much the problem as she indicates that she and her siblings would stop when the person being tickled pleaded for it to stop.  But the blog's comment section in general, which Schulenburg does condone, has some pretty nasty stories about sustained tickle-torturing going on for 10-20 minutes or so well after desperate pleas for it to stop.

Many comments positively remark on tickling people until they can't breathe, panic, urinate, almost pass out from oxygen deprivation, and inappropriate tactics to make the ""victim"" feel vulnerable before doing so and ignoring begging pleas for it to stop.  

&gt;Don’t listen to nonsense like “i cant breathe!” Of course you can you are talking! 

Mind you, usually in a BDSM context, this type of thing is done, but with consent and safe words. But these stories are often taking place in much more casual familial settings where none of that is established.

Almost everyone in this blog post thought this was acceptable behavior to allow between kids, siblings, and even from parents to children. And victims who didn't enjoy it were just poor sports who needed to toughen up, and accept being a repeated target. The very few who offered dissenting opinions about how just because one is laughing doesn’t mean they’re enjoying it because it’s an involuntary response and that consent should be obtained and respected for this sort of thing, were told that they were being crybabies with no sense of humor, and shut down or had their comments removed.

Now mind you, normal healthy tickling or pokes that seems commonplace of a few seconds that is often enjoyed, is one thing, but this article and more so, the comments just seem abusive (even if not the legal definition of it).

Here’s an excerpt of one story, just to showcase:

&gt;Her thrashing before was nothing compared to the fit she threw, but there was no way she was getting free. The “under the arm” hold worked perfectly and I was able to concentrate on the job at hand (or the job at foot, so to speak. There’s something about tickling that lends itself to puns!)

&gt;Her foot was so small and soft – perfect for tickling! I loved watching it close up – her sole scrunching up, her toes wiggling madly, and that poor foot trying so hard to escape. Brad was laughing, “Make sure to get in between her toes – it’s her favorite!” I don’t really think it was her favorite, but I know I had fun sliding my fingers between them and feeling her reaction. Since I was facing away from her, I couldn’t see Stephanie’s facial reactions, but I loved hearing her combination of laughing, screaming and begging. Brad was quite good at teasing her (practice makes perfect, I guess!) He’d say “Steph, tell me you love it and I’ll stop!” She yelled back “Stop! I HATE it!!” then he’d say “Okay, since you you didn’t do as I said, I’ll keep going! Her shriek went up another octave, with “Okay, Okay, I love it!!” “Well, since you love it, we should keep going then!”

&gt;At that point, I felt torn. We had been going at it for around fifteen minutes. The three boys were having a great time. Stephanie, not so much. Her laughter was becoming more desperate and hysterical. Her resistance had weakened to almost nothing. Even her begging was sounding more feeble. I think Brad and my brother were oblivious to it, but I was very aware.

&gt;[…]

&gt;Well, that day the devil on my shoulder won the battle over the angel. We kept it up for another five minutes or so with just a few breaks. Then Brad wrapped it up. “We’ll stop, if you promise not to tell Mom &amp; Dad,… deal? If not, we’ll keep going!” Stephanie wailed “Stop! Stop! I won’t tell!” “okay, then” and he slapped the bottom of her foot and let her go. My brother and I followed his lead. She laid there for about ten minutes, recovering.

And these types of stories were applauded and praised.  And I personally think this is taking something that's supposed to be playful and fun in moderation, to a cruel extreme, and shouldn't be condoned or trivialized just because there is laughter.  It's involuntary, reflexive laughter, and excessive tickling has actually been seriously used as a torturing method in the past.  

Personally, I’m actually a possible fan of being tickle tortured and it’s something I wish to explore. That said, this seems really wrong to me, and is the typical nature of the whole bunch of stories in there. I found the anecdotes on this page to be awfully upsetting.  It irks me that there's no decent thread or forum post calling these people out so far, so I'd like to make one just so that people don't feel alone if they had similar negative reactions to reading this blog post.",12Sep2019,1
16,I’m a senior in college. After class and the gym today I planned to be sooo productive. I have 3 different assignments for 3 different classes that need to get done within the next few days... and today I did none of it. I didn’t even get around to doing laundry like I had planned. I don’t know what happened. As soon as I sat down it’s like all of the energy was sucked outside of my body and all I could do was lay down feeling exhausted. Nobody’s fault but mine.

18,"I guess I just need somewhere to write this down and be completely honest and make a decision regarding where I’ll live until January.

I (30F) currently live with my mother. I’m currently paying her monthly about $400 dollars to live in the house. It’s cool because I help her with the house when fixing needs to be done (for example window replacements for the living room managed and paid by me), and I also got to save up a lot and paid my student loans in a very short time. It’s also hard another times bc my mother is 68 yo and has depression, is a bit narcissistic and has a big hard dose of OCD.  This makes me sad and makes me want to cheer her up most of the time, and give her lots of love, but sometimes she’s unbearable. I’m also under lots of stress at work.

Now, I managed to fully pay my debts and am facing the following situation: in January I’m renting an apartment. Probably with my boyfriend, which would be great, economically speaking, because we could split/share expenses. Thing is, either with or without him, it’s happening, but I can’t right now because I just finished paying my student loans. 

I’m now facing two options with several pros and cons:
- I either start paying more ($550 dollars/month) for the housing since my mom is going through a dark spot economically and hence would move to a smaller apartment if I left
Pros: includes food, is close to my office (30 min walk), 15 min in Uber and costs about 3 dollars a ride, I get to help my mom a bit till I move out in January, don’t have to move my stuff right now, boyfriend can stay over, can invite friends, near the subway and very well connected for me that don’t own a car
Cons: moms mental state and sometimes overall bitterness in life and OCD

- rent the top floor of a house of an elderly couple at $430 dollars/month 
Pros: house is AMAZING, would have a fridge + freezer entirely for myself, space is much bigger than what I have home, more options regarding how much to wash in the washing machine, has a pool, all my things fit, more independence but just to a point because couldn’t invite boyfriend over, get a break from mom’s bitterness 
Cons: if I buy the food it would be almost the same as the $550,I would have to do two moves from here to January, it’s very far from the office so in uber it would easily be around 35 min commute and around $10 dollars each time, or 50 min commute by bus/subway, very far from friends, boyfriend, and family 

So right now I’m more inclined towards the upping the rent and staying but also think maybe the top floor would be an interesting experience but am a bit lazy to deal with the distance without a car??

22,"Today is a somber day. A generation has been raised with no living memory, or are nearing adulthood learning about it through textbooks and the memories of parents, family, and friends. They have no recollection of what the world or the nation was like before that day. When the big political debate was fetal stem cell usage, and the controversially elected leader of the country actively campaigned against nation building. What followed was the briefest moment where the great American melting pot spoke with one voice, and with its growing diversity, came together to soothe the soul of a crying nation. 

It is not something to be forgotten. In fact it is the one thing that I won’t joke or kid about. My family is one of the lucky ones, one to have their family member walk away from the Pentagon, while so many would perish in New York, or go down heroically in a Pennsylvania field. Faith and luck would continue to be with us as he returned from deployments, duty stations, and troop surges. However, the same cannot be said for the thousands that were sent out and never returned, and the thousands more who came back only to end their own lives, an epidemic that ravages the country to this day. 

To say that stayed until present day would be an idealistic lie ignoring the last eighteen years. The creeping fear of the other raised its ugly head once more, and once again the American urge to strike out against what doesn’t feel or look like them rose from its slumber since Pearl Harbor. There was no need for internment camps, through the PATRIOT Act, expansion of FISA Warrants, the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, everyone was effectively watched, monitored, and came back to the puritannical streak of spying on one’s neighbor. A digital and cultural panopticon came forward and has become all too commonplace privately and publicly.

At the time, we were told that the world would hear us. Yet so many could not speak or feared the courts of public opinion as many saw the erosion of civil liberties escalate. The world heard us, as America did what America has done best since its inception. The nation went to war. The nation went to war across the globe, fighting a shadowy, asymmetric enemy whose ideals couldn’t be destroyed no matter what the kill count was. We had no endgame, other than to seek some sort of retribution, lashing out against leaders and cells on the world’s stage. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, the American tour now arrived to the Middle East, a land stymied by sectarian differences with borders created by the French and English from a war a century old. 
 
Warfare changed yet felt familiar, as the most technologically advanced and superior fighting force in the world was once again fighting against insurgents, guerillas, radicals. One man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter. An untold thousands of combatants, civilians, children, aid workers and government officials have perished. The labels changed, almost anyone was considered a combatant as administrations changed. The wars had grown unpopular, the nation fundamentally transformed. A promise of change swept the land, but the only change that followed was a vast mechanization and expansion of the conflict, machines replacing men as promises to bring the boys home rang true.

And so we left. Left a country that so many believe we entered under false pretenses, a nation now ravaged by war with little to no resources, government, or men to rebuild. New evils emerged. Hundreds of thousands were displaced, killed, or stuck in a similar conflict with many of the same parties involved. Now at a point where even the most god-fearing, gun-toting politician will agree with his or her counterpart to the left and state that the actions that followed this day were a mistake, the great American misadventure in foreign affairs.

So here I am, writing on a platform that didn’t even exist when the towers fell, the Pentagon ablaze, and brave souls fighting in Pennsylvania airspace. I grew up in a world and a country that gave its faith, its freedoms, pieces of its very soul hoping that those in charge and those in the shadows willing to do harm on our behalf would know what to do. 

This tragedy, this attack, showed me, and millions of children across the world on that September day there is evil out there. Such evils must be confronted, and hopefully destroyed in such a fashion that they may never harm another soul. Nothing can be done to bring back the thousands of lives lost, the thousands more who have died from disease and complications as a first responder. And no amount of folded flags, yellow ribbons, or patriotic ballads can bring back the servicemembers who left in defense of a nation, an ancient calling of service; and never came home.

So here we are. If such a day were a person it would now be old enough to vote. The very system that has enshrined our freedoms and liberty is now in such a place that it is in a constant state of distrust and partisanship. So as we remember, as we look back, give our prayers, condolences, memorials, be reminded that this nation is still here. As Americans, regardless of views we all share this vast and open land. And while I have gone on, on a rather pessimistic tone, this country through its people will continue to survive and stand tall.

We have survived a civil war, the plague of slavery, the dust bowl, a great depression, two world wars, the threat of nuclear annihilation, a great recession, and the attacks on September 11th, 2001. If we can survive these things, continue to strengthen the foundations of this great country, then we can carry on, and learn from our mistakes. 

So as we remember, I will leave with this. America, and Americans around the world, are not perfect. But as long as this nation still stands, we will remain to hold onto the capacity to make it perfect.",12Sep2019,3

30,"Am I an asshole is being difficult for going over the character limit so I’ll post here I guess 

Complicated story but I’ll try to explain it as better as I can, bear with me. 

Okay so when I was really young I had the perfect family . I was legit so happy etc. one day my brother started bullying me in school and I finally worked up the courage to tell my mom who I obviously loved and trusted. I told her, she was in the kitchen chopping carrots and she turned around, got on her knees and slapped me told me to never say such bullshit lies etc. my parents immediately turned (trying to avoid the word because mods will remove)

So this kept going until I was 19. At this point I was so ready to just “go” if me enlisting in the military didn’t work out but it did and I left. 

A few months passed I got held back at boot camp for medical issues but I got out after 5 long months. Throughout boot camp drill instructors had given me the “family matters” speech when I couldn’t provide an emergency contact number/parents info/assign someone to my life insurance policy. 

So for my boot graduation I asked if they wanted to come and they did. I took leave and I went back “home” for leave. My parents, especially my mother who had been infinite x more (ab use ive) instantly turned so caring. 3 days into leave I was begging to leave for MCT because my mom was getting so weird I legit thought she was trying to poison me. 

Long story short i started “building” a relationship with my parents. I never forgot any of the bullshit they did to me. Sometimes they’re like “why are you like this?” “What happened happened “ “why can’t you forgive us” 

One time she wasn’t taking care of my pet bunny and I just got fed up and was like “if that rabbit dies you can forget I ever existed. If I can’t see her again why should you ever be able to see me? She dies to me then I die to you”  which got the message across. 

This time, I’m stationed in Hawaii and home state is CA. I want my car shipped here but the nearest port is in Los Angeles. I live by Sacramento so it’s about a 300mile drive. At first I was like “I am NOT asking dad to drive it there” but dad offered and shit then I had this argument with my brother over “I am not taking hand outs from him or you” so I got to applying for a loan to buy a car here but then my brother called and gave me a speech about not buying a car. So I was like “fine” but instead asked how much dad made an hour/a day on a typical day. Then I asked how much he made etc. calculated everything and I was like “ok drive over the car but I’m paying whoever drives it over to LA” and gave them the calculation of their wages(both usually works over time so calculated their wages plus a plane ticket back home and cost of an Uber home from the airport x3 days) came out to like 1200 for dad and a little under 1k for brother. They both came back asking why I was being “difficult “ and a scumbag etc. I then went back to the “I’m not taking shit from either of you, the only reason I ever took from you when I was 18-19 was because I was doing college and couldn’t even afford to sustain myself, I have a job now and won’t take your hand outs, take the money or don’t drive the car”",12Sep2019,1

Why?  


I've been suicidal, anxious, depression for years, and I have ADHD. I'm not as suicidal as I used to. I've gotten a good grip on those thoughts, but I still have severe anxiety. But I think that's what I want to look into now.

He asked if I was not attracted to him at all and I had to be honest. 

A while ago, I really liked a guy. I was so sure we had something going.. something different. I thought he must’ve felt it too. But in the end he told me he didn’t like me as much as I liked him.

42,"I need to change my life and dig myself out of this hole and I don't even know where to start.

- Year 11, Australia, FTM transgender (extremely early on, pre-T).

- Distance education due to mental illness (agoraphobia/anxiety/...etc) has left me in severe isolation. While I'm doing kind of better now, I have no IRL friends, and I haven't talked to people in years. No idea how to get out and make friends, scared I'll look like a huge cringemeister, and I don't pass yet so I am scared of discrimination. No LGBT meetups nearby (or, at least, I don't know where to find them). No hobbies that let me meet people. :(

- Struggling with OCD and depression. Have had horrible symptoms for months with no signs of improvement. Tried meditation, went to a psychologist and they told me I probably need to be medicated. Going to a psychiatrist on Saturday but I'm scared SSRIs won't fix me, or will make me worse. Scared I'll go crazy. 

- No motivation to do anything because I'm so horribly depressed. No focus whatsoever. I try so hard but it doesn't work.  I have exams next week and I haven't studied. I barely study anyway because I'm too miserable... I just skim the material and wing it, and for some reason it all goes fine. Everyone thinks I'm way smarter than I really am, but I put in no effort at all. I feel incredibly stupid for thinking I can constantly get away with this. I don't even know how to study. I don't really have the energy to pick up the material anymore.

- I don't have any energy to do anything. I know watching something or doing something I love will make me feel better. But I sit around doing nothing for hours. Why? How do I stop? Why can't I do things?

- Scared I'll entirely flunk the HSC. I can't even study anyway. I don't know how. I'm too fucking sad. I don't really know any of the material from this year, so how will I even do next year? I just wing it and get away with it and I can't stop. 

- I don't have any plans for a job. I don't know what I want to do after school. I don't have any ambitions. I can't make a job out of any of my hobbies. Everyone says I'm an amazing artist but doing it makes me sad. And my skillset would never fit a real job as an artist. I'm scared I'll be denied from jobs because I'm trans and I'll have shit HSC results. 

- I need to move out, but I'm scared if I get a roommate, I'll be discriminated against. I'm scared I won't even be able to get a proper job. My family won't stop screaming and yelling at each other, making me feel even worse than I already do.

43,Been through a lot recently. I guess dealing with trauma that i can’t get over? Made the decision to speak my colleges counselor. Never been to therapy or anything before and i’m very nervous. Any advice for a first timer? :( it’s causing me a lot of anxiety,12Sep2019,2
44,"So I need a little advice. I’ll cross post to a advice sub too 

Okay so I’ve had this issue on my mind for the longest time. 

Alright so I’m a male, 20 currently serving in the military. I enlisted for 2 reasons. 1. My shitty parents situation and 2. I didn’t really know what I wanted to do in life. 

I was going to college for a psychology major along with a nutrition program thing family consumer sciences. The thing is, I absolutely cannot stand math. I hate it and I’m horrible at it. It’s one of the reasons I took the major I did. I still didn’t exactly “like” I did like my major but like I didn’t if it makes sense? It’s kinda of a it’s what I liked the most.. 

So I enlisted in the marine corps. The less shitty job field i thought of was logistics. I was given a job as a 2311 otherwise known as an ammo technician. 

Again, I don’t “like” my profession but I don’t hate it either. At this point I’ll be 23? By the time I get out p late to be changing around. 

Currently with my training I can get a job with a base salary of around 70k year. If I complete my bachelors (but in business) I’ll be making a little more but it varies from state to state. DC being the highest paying and CA (my home stage and preferred state) being one of the higher paying ones at around 100k a year. 

Now, I work with obviously classified shit/ hazardous shit/ transporting those munitions/ different hazard classes etc. so obviously, there’s always more training you could get. If I keep getting training in my job field by the time I get out I could have some very uh.. “expensive” training under my belt which is obviously preferred when looking for a job and having that training you could open up more job fields. 

So the thing is, keep looking for something I honestly like and not just “don’t hate” or, keep going and make some bank while potentially sacrificing happiness. 

At this point i think it’s worth mentioning I have depression I always speculated it was the reason for me not being able to find a profession I honestly liked. 

Also, I’m barely a year in the corps. I have 3 years to go which could be a long time to get costly training for free while I’m in",12Sep2019,2

I can't focus on anything and both my depression and anxiety have worsened considerably.
Everyone just calls me lazy (which I am to some degree). Honest to God though, even when I give it my all I always seem to fall short.
 I'm supposed to be getting tested for ADD (which was hell just getting anyone to listen to my concerns in the first place) but it's been 3 weeks and and the docter hasn't returned any of my calls. I'm stumped.
I can't keep track of my schoolwork and it's only been 2 weeks. It feels like I'm drowning just thinking about it. It's not even that I find school hard, I just can't concentrate. 
My job doesn't help either. It was fun at first but it requires an enormous amount of energy which I just don't have anymore. I can't quit because it's run by a family member who depends on me. I get major anxiety before every shift. 
I'm always stressed and it's exhausting. I get constant headaches now, I can't remeber the last time my head was clear. It used to be just a fog but now it physically hurts. 
I just feel like I'm drifting through life. No more enjoyment (I still can laugh and joke with my friends). I also get waves of apathy (they luckily aren't as frequent anymore), I literally won't care about anything which scares me deeply. 
Worst of all is the constant feeling of loneliness. It doesn't make sense however, I have more than enough friends and a loving family, yet here I am typing this mess of a post. 
Everyone thinks I'm a pseudo intellectual because I enjoy learning math as a hobby. Even my father called me one the other day. I swear I actually learn the math and don't just read pop science articles and pass it off as me understanding the material.

50,"So I’m currently in an almost two year relationship where it feels like we’re just roommates and nothing more. I’ve tried to have multiple talks about my needs, their needs, and unfortunately it doesn’t get anyway. 

I met up with an old friend to get some help about what to do. He told me that if I was unhappy, then I should break up with him. I agreed, and said I would, but by the time I got to our apartment I chickened out. So now I’m telling myself that I’ll have one last talk with him in a few weeks to say what I really need from him in a relationship. If nothing changes, then I leave, because at least I know I gave it my all. 

Well, my friend that I had a coffee date with, gave my number and sent pics of me to a friend of his. And we totally hit it off without even trying... I told him up front that I was still working on my relationship but had no problems become friends. He said he respected that and needed more friends anyway since we was new to the area. 

WELL we texted all night, and had a great vibe texting. Which obviously confuses me now, because how can someone who I just met listen to me so well, compared to someone I’ve been with for almost two years.

I just came here to vent. Kinda get it off my chest. I know I should talk to my boyfriend and just rip the bandaid off, but I’ve reached the unhealthy “I’m comfortable and don’t want to ruin that” phase...

I currently live at home with my parents and siblings, which is no issue. I like being here because it’s a sense of security.

For university, I am torn between moving away and studying in a new city while doing my degree (which is considered the norm). 

Or I can stay at home, continue with my job and also studying full time on the side with the Open University (which is basically online school).

56,"Nala was my baby. Her mum was a stray cat who chose us when I was 17. Nala was born in my brother's closet. Nala never bit anyone. She was so docile and lovely. She sat on our laps for cuddles, would sleep on my bed, she would always greet me whenever I walked into a room that she was in. Three months ago, Nala went missing. She had always been an indoor/outdoor cat (I regret ever letting her out) and when she went missing I posted it everywhere and offered an award. 

Last month, my baby girl came back. She was skinny, but gobbled up her food. She couldn't walk properly though, and so I took her to the vet, who told me that she was fine, just malnourished. She prescribed Nala pain relief medication and high calorie cat food, which Nala ate. 

Today, when I got home from work, Nala was very uncoordinated. Since visiting the vet for the first time, Nala had been unbalanced but today it seemed like she'd declined. Nala fell into her food. She couldn't move her front legs, and I noticed that she had thick saliva coming from her mouth. 

I called the vet and asked for the next appointment, which was 5:15pm. I told the lady on the phone Nala's symptoms, and she asked me to bring Nala in as soon as possible for observation, which I did. 

Around an hour after dropping Nala off (1:00pm), I was asked to come back in. 

When I got there, I was told that although Nala had been eating over the last few weeks (she'd been eating three packages of wet food a day) she had lost weight since her first visit. Her gums were white (why didn't I know to check that? Why?) and it looked like her organs were shutting down. 

The vet told me that they could run rigorous tests on her, pump fluids into her and keep her alive, but ultimately it looked like something else was going on. 

She told me that it would be best to put Nala down. 

I agreed. I could see how poorly she was. She wasn't the same cat. 

So, I held Nala, I told her that she was such a beautiful girl and that I loved her, and she was put to sleep. 

I am absolutely heartbroken. I took her home with me, wrapped by the vets in fresh cloth with a pretty bow. She was still warm. 

Her body is on the couch right now. Our soil is hard and it's dark outside, but my Dad said that he'll bury her tomorrow. 

I am so sorry that she had to be in pain for so long. I honestly thought that she would get better if I fed her enough food and syringe fed her water.

58,"22  years old, one year left in college for my second degree, still living    at home, and my father gave me a talk today which ended in an   ultimatum.  To explain, my current weekly schedule is this:

Monday - Thursday: Work my delivery job in the morning (7:30 am - 12:00 pm    Mon/Tues, 7:30 am - 10 am Wed/Thurs) then drive to school (1:15 pm -    6:15 pm Mon/Tues, 11 am - 6:15 pm Wed/Thurs) and I get home at 7:15 pm    to do homework, eat, etc.Fridays and Saturdays I work my main job from 6 am - 3 pm.Sunday I'm off.

A   workload a lot of people have my age or older when in college and still    trying to have some cash. Nothing new here, a decent workload to a lot    of people, but we all got to do it right? Life isn't easy and never   will  be.Also, I somehow have a girlfriend who I am very fond of and my   time  with her is important just like in any relationship.

But let's get into what actually happened:  
Woke up this morning after  going   on a movie date (watched IT: Chapter 2, honestly pretty good for  a  clown  horror movie) pretty tired because I got home late and got up  at  6:30,  normally don't come home late it just happened that way.   Nevertheless, I  got up and was talking to my mother about taking off   Wed/Thur mornings  from my second job, want to spend more time focusing   on school in the morning, be able to sleep in a little in case of late   nights, and still  be able to see my girlfriend like usual. I'm given   the ""Welcome to the  real world"" bit and I snapped at her (raised my   voice) for it, it was  wrong, no excuses on that, just a little tired   and got a little mad, I  immediately apologized, she forgave me, no big   deal, I tell her bye and  hope she has a good day at work, and I leave   to go to work, life goes  on. Get a text from my father while at school   saying ""Come straight home  after school."" and a lecture on how I  should  never disrespect her and  they won't tolerate me ""completely   disrespecting my mother, who nursed  me, raised me, been with me in both   thick and thin situations, and is my  father's wife."" Then I'm told I   need to decide what my priorities are  because if I focused on myself   more I wouldn't have a problem with work  and school. Basically they   were telling me to see my girlfriend less.  I'm sitting here confused as   hell, feel like this is blown out of  proportion, and thinking to   myself ""if I choose to miss out on 5 hours  of work for school and my   girlfriend isn't that my own business? I was  just making small talk...""   Then I'm told I need to decide what my  priorities are by Monday, my   father understands my girlfriend is  probably one of the top 3, but he   feels I need to focus on myself more,  and if my priorities don't change   the way they are now, I was told that I  should probably move in with her.

The  whole snapping at my  mom  part has only happened twice in the past 3  months, both times   apologized for, I label it as ""Crap happens, life goes on."" First time   was because of storing flour without keeping it in a  plastic bag   (stupid, right? But it happened and again, I was wrong and  therefore   apologized, nothing else I can do.) Neither times were I  cursing her,  threatening her, or whatever, just typical arguments.

While this has definitely been considered, moving in is extremely premature (5 month relationship) but I'm also sitting here wondering ""Should I pull my pants down and bend over my Dad's knee at this point?"" Because    I've been having to teach myself how to do my own taxes, pay  insurance,   how insurance works in general (never got taught this by  anyone   including my parents, should really be taught in high school,  but   DEFINITELY should have been taught to me by my parents a long time  ago)   and I've already lived on my own before, only moved back in with  my   parents because I transferred to a different school 2 years ago.

I'm    just trying to do the right thing, don't really know what that is, I    feel like if I stay things will only get worse, and if I leave things    may get complicated with my girlfriend (going too fast scenario) on  top   of staying in school. I just can't believe I'm 22 years old and  having   to really decide what to do over this mediocre BS. These two    arguments do not, nor have they ever, appeared severe to me. (Kids,    never argue with your mom, you will lose every time regardless of what's    going on.) Apparently they are, and now I have to decide if I'm  moving   out or not.

Just a side note: school is only about a month in, have all A's so far, graduated Magna Cum Laude with my first degree.

So please tell me, am I an asshole? Tell me because I'm at a crossroad and I'm just blown away.",12Sep2019,8

60,"I'm approaching my fourth and final year of university soon and lately have been reflecting on my educational journey until now- from primary school through to high school and university.

I have always been what many would say a ""high achiever."" My standards have always been extremely high and while I'm proud of myself, I guess I've never really been fully satisfied. I achieved my educational-related ""goals"" throughout school but never felt a sincere sense of achievement. It never felt good enough and so I naturally increased my expectations more and more. That inevitably resulted in more and more focus on academic work. To summarise, I guess studying and achieving-well academically is a big part of my identity and it's fair to say I've put a lot of my eggs in the academic basket. 

With this being said, as I'm transitioning to adulthood and nearing tertiary graduation, I feel like my lack of attention to other aspects of life throughout school, e.g. social life, relationships, financial, is beginning to catch up with me. This is not to say I ONLY focused on academic success- I have an amazing group of friends, have worked a part-time job since Year 9 and maintain a good relationship with family. I'm not incompetent in these areas (e.g. social life, relationships, financial), so to say, but I just feel as if I didn't fully capitalise on every aspect of the experience, and that too much of my focus has been on academic success, i.e. too many, but not all, of my eggs have been put into the academic basket. 

I'm realising more and more lately that there is more to life than academic success, and learning-about and delving into these ""other"" aspects of life has been overwhelming to say the least. I was always told throughout school that education wasn't everything, but it's not until lately where I've truly been appreciating it.

With that being said, I am one to focus on the positives of every situation. Being academically-focused has developed within me a series of 'pros' (solid work ethic, problem solving skills, discipline etc). Many of these things have helped me excel in other areas of life, e.g. part time job.

We were at the point in our friendship that I didn't need to knock before I went into his house and my fingerprint was in his phone because he let me use his, as I do not have a phone.

62,"I am recently Widowed, in my 40's and for the last 21 years was in an amazing relationship with the love of my life.

In the past month I have spent some time on dating websites, it has been hilarious and quite depressing at the same time, sort of dipping my toe back into the water, I even looked into an online relationship, just to see if anything like that is for me.

Now lets just state now I am no ones catch, Overweight, I have Bipolar effective disorder type 2, ADHD and PTSD, yay for those and somewhere on the higher functioning autism scale, I also am in remission from Bowel cancer, my therapist actually is amazed I am still alive.

I am moving forward, losing weight, balanced my bank account, taking small steps towards a life after my wife's death.

This is not a self depreciation post, I have my positive sides, the whole sticking by my Wife through cancer, diabetes, dialysis, coronary disease and being there at her side till the end 18 hours a day for 20 years, highly intelligent, a confirmed geek/nerd (built my first computer at 12) Learned more about Cancer, Dialysis and Coronary care than anyone should when looking after someone, I knew the dialysis adaptive peritoneal system so well that I ended up being the one who took care of the machines while my Wife was in hospital. Anything I put my mind to I end up being at least okay at, for example in March I became a streamer (never used a mic or cam before that) now I stream to 5 different places every day have about 1000+ videos up on Youtube from gaming to vlogs, some of what I have done in my life is actually amazing, I built my own online game in 1999 and it is still running today.

I am still broken but we learn how to cope.

After a month of experiences on a few different dating and meetings I am amazed anyone ever gets together these days, so many obvious red flags, fake profiles, people who once you get to talk to them openly admit they are already in a relationship but its okay for whatever reasons, others are just interested in one night stands or afternoon quickies.

I only met a few genuine woman in a month and the first she was so hurt and damaged by past lies and deception that I ended up being what she needed a friend, in fact the others became friends too.

I am not saying it didn't happen while I was young, I was a virgin till 26 because simply put I was more interested in my computers, roleplay, gaming and programming than girls at my local college and Uni who only seemed to care about materialistic things (not all are like that but when most of them within the first few seconds asked you about money or if you had a car, I just stopped).

For the record I met my Wife at a party, she was sitting down and as I walked past she challenged me by saying Babylon 5 is better than Deep Space 9, we talked for 4 hours and spent nearly every day for the next 21 years together.

I don't get the mind games and the shallow ideals, I don't get the fake photos both male and female, I don't understand the point of deception if you actually want to meet up with someone.

Do people really believe that if they get to the point of a meeting that they can pull it off if they look nothing like a picture.

I guess it is okay for short term or notches on a bed post but what if you meet someone really nice, someone genuine and you started that friendship, that maybe relationship with deception, how exactly does that work.

On the plus side I have made a few friends.

But I just find the rise of Tinder, Facebook, lies/deception/mind games being the new norm a world that I don't want to be part of and yes Netflix and chill to me would mean sitting down and watching a series/film on netflix kind of blunt and honest like that.

On the other hand I could just be looking on the wrong places or having really bad luck.",12Sep2019,1
63,"I went home for the weekend, my mom asked me to head over to the neighbors to water their plants, they are on vacation. I unlock the door, as I am greeted by an unholy odor that would Make an exorcist Lose faith. I’m thinking their cat died or something, and my phone is dead. So I have to. Venture into the ungodly odor in order to use the landline in the kitchen to call my mom to see if she knows about the smell. As I pass their fridge, I see a post it note that Just says “Kate, Don’t call 911. No one died. It’s just the plant. So I follow the smell to the greenhouse room at the back of the house, and there I find it’s all it’s glory, a corpse flower in full bloom. It reeks like an elemental cemetery. So I water the plants and get the hell out of there. The neighbor is a botanist, and the corpse flower is why she fled her house for the next week.

64,My dad left us when I was like 3 but he went to another country to study and look for a better life for us... we were supposed to be with him later but he died a few days before we get there. I didnt cry at his funeral I was so young I was 5 and I didnt understand why everyone was so sad I even told my older brother not to cry. I dont have any memories with him except the one where he is lying dead on a bed. I grew up fine and never really felt his absence but these days its killing me I cry every night thinking about my life if he was there. I'm 20 now and people kept telling me how he loved me how he looked like me and how he loved to think and talk just like me. I feel like he is the only person in this world who could have understand me but he is not here. I dont even know how his voice sounds like. I wish he could hug me and give me advice. These days I feel like everything I do is useless since he cant see it and tell me he is proud of me. What hurt me the most is that I will never really meet him. The only picture of him I have in my head is him lying down dead...its the only memories left of him. I kept wondering why I miss someone I dont know. I try selfishly to blame him for leaving us and  think that he was a bad father so I can stop missing him but there is not a single bad story about him.,12Sep2019,1

74,"It's about this girl I know and this is what happened:

She was the wife of a friend of mine (divorced now) and while I liked her, and I liked talking to her but there was nothing there past that. We were in touch but we only talked once every few weeks.

We started talking daily in November as I was talking about going for beers with her and her hubby when they come back to the country for Christmas and stuff. She said yes and that we'll talk later cause she won't be coming at Christmas time

December comes and he returns to country without her, he says she didn't want to visit that Christmas. I took it in stride, kept talking to her and didn't think much of it. I kind of had the idea that they'd fought or separated or something but didn't ask.

February comes around and she confirms they separated in October or November and she lives alone and we should go for a beer sometime when she gets back or I could visit.

We keep talking almost daily and turns out she has a bf now, 20 years older than her.

She's making innuendos with me on chat and saying she doesn't love the guy.

April swings around and she visits the country and we go out for a beer. I'm still not thinking she's interested and don't really have an interest at this point except deep down somewhere. We go out and we kinda get drunk and she asks to go home with me. I panic, cause this is unexpected, while I want to I didn't expect this, it's kind of out of the blue, my house is a mess, she's married to my friend. I say no, it's not a good idea at the time. She says fine, but we're taking an uber to get us home and she's paying.

She leaves again and we keep talking every day, I get pictures of her trying on clothes (nothing nude or anything, just her in different clothes) I make a suggestion here and there what looks good and what doesn't and what I think would look good and what not. She takes it in stride agreeing or disagreeing.

I start searching for jobs in her city, I was already searching for jobs in that country but now I concentrate on the city in particular, we talk about this and she encourages me to gogogo. I get no response or negative responses and mention in passing that might be the language or the fact that I'm not there. She suggests I can come stay with her and search for jobs and get language lessons while staying with her free of charge in her 2 room rental (this is the beginning of August). She's still with that bf of hers during this time and she mentions him from time to time, I respond with ""..."" and stop talking when that comes up cause I don't want any details about that.

In June we are talking about going to the beach and she mentions she would like to but doesn't know who with, I say I'll go and she says that's OK. She riles other people to go and it's a party. When she gets here again, in September, we're going to the beach, or that's the plan.

Mid August comes around and I'm asking about the beach she says that's probably not happening cause the other people dropped and only the 2 of us...

I get some stickers made with some of her art and some pictures and plan to surprise her with them when we meet.

Just before getting here in September she sends me a drunk text, some picture with some comment, nothing too lewd or anything like that.

At this point I'm about certain we're having something but don't want to make the first move due to who she is and destroying a friendship by being dumb (stay tuned)

She sends me this selfie where she's all dolled up and mentions that it's for the new guy and I go ""ah shit"" and go my usual ""..."" and stay out the chat for the night cause...

It's now September and she gets here, we go out for a beer, after she had her divorce papers issued that morning (or the morning prior, can't remember exactly). We have a date basically, we go for a few beers in a craft beer place, we talk, I spring the stickers on her, her face drops, we talk about stuff, her family, her meeting them rarely but how it's nice, I see pictures of them and how she went shopping with her niece and sisters. We go to my work place, there's a nice terrace with a nice view, I'm still not sure if this is actually something romantic so I stay put and am a ""perfect gentleman"" (at least according to me) through this just talking and stuff. We leave the building to go for a beer in a bar, we meet some people, we have more beers we bar hop for a while, dance (silly, cause I'm not a dancer) and about 3 or 4 in the morning we sit on a bench and talk a bit she brings the new guy into discussion and I go ""TMI"" ""what do you mean TMI?"" ""too much info, I don't wanna know about him"" then she grabs my face and says ""just want to see something"" and kisses me. I go ""what are you doing?"" cause it's out of the blue and cause I'm dumb like that but I reciprocate. Then she stops and kinda grabs her knees with her hands and says ""it's too late"" and we kiss some more and hug n stuff then she says she should go home. I follow to make sure she gets safe (it's 4 in the morning by now). We walked in silence, didn't know what to say but we get to her place and I grab her and kiss her some more and she responds. Then after a few minutes she stops me and plants a final kiss on me and goes in.

We exchange a messages the next day, she says that the guy makes her happy and she doesn't why to let go of that. I say fair enough.

We keep talking and at some point, one week later I invite her to my place, I have a few games she expressed interest in playing but she says to go out instead so we go out. We meet some people, she's a bit more distant but after a few drinks we're making innuendos and joking around. We walk home about 2 am but nothing happens except I invite her back to my place again but she says no.

We go out a third time, this time only the 2 of us, we have some beer and she asks about my impending trip to her city, I have a plane ticket for next week bought in July, and what am I going to do with this visit cause she can't host me anymore as it would be awkward. We didn't get to a conclusion on this one but I change the subject when it hits a plateau and we talk about stuff and go to another bar and have some wine and talk about movies for another hour. I'm having a good time and she seems to be as well but I know at the end of the night she's still saying ""no"" so I'm stupid with the help of the wine and say a bunch of dumb stuff (""can't you undo the thing with the other guy?""). I apologize for this, my mouth was really going on it's own vocalizing some thoughts and the booze wasn't helping.

I really believe that I could have been a bit more firm with my handling of her but I don't want to get too physical without reciprocation as that would be bad.

And I know I'm rubbish at communicating but nothing good ever came out of telling someone directly that I liked her.",12Sep2019,1

80,"I’m zeroing in on 40. And I’m finding that my attention span actually seems to be decreasing. 

I have always loved reading books, but over the past several years I’ve finished very few of the ones I’ve started. I develop sudden and random interests in various things, whether it’s music, a foreign language, a particular genre, a TV series, cooking, etc, but nothing ever sticks. I feel like I’m perennially shifting from one thing to another, always kind of dabbling, but never really going in depth into anything. 

I’m realizing now that this is pretty much the story of my whole life, and it’s probably why at age 39 I am pretty much stalled out. I stumbled into a career I really didn’t like, and then washed out of it about a year ago. Now I’m flailing around, ostensibly planning to go back to school for a health sciences field. But it will probably just be money down the drain. I have no idea if it will actually work out, or if I’m going to be able to keep at it.

I am over $120,000 in debt due to ill conceived and badly planned educational ventures.

I can’t even finish books. They’re just laying all around my house, most of them about 1/3 of the way read, I’ll find books I don’t even remember buying, and I’ll go into these panic modes where I think I have to read all of these books but I cannot for the life of me single one out and just sit down and read the damn thing. 

I was going to talk to a psychiatrist about having ADHD, but I just lost insurance because my wife lost her job, so that’s that for now I guess.

I'm ""cold called"" about new opportunities on Linkedin everyday, several times a day. 

Most recruiters are inept at recruiting and expect ppl to bite their jobs for shit reasons.

No, I'm not going to take a pay cut just because your company is cool.

In fact, offering me the exact same income for me to change to your company is pointless - why should I take the risk?

""Oh but there's room for climbing the hierarchy in a year or two"" - That's what every company says you dumb fuck.

I've tried to filter what gets sent to me, for a job change I need to know if I'd join at a higher position than I am now, make more money or have less stress ; but if I ask these out of the bat people will get offended , why can't I ask the 3 basic things that make most people move jobs (discounting ""my job/boss sucks and I hate this place"") since I'm not actively looking for a job and you came to me, I'm listing the three major things (of which you just need to give me one) that would make me move, why are you throwing a hissy fit about it? Why do you think it's better to waste everyone's time with a bunch of interviews that will end with disappointment for both of us?

I had a happy childhood, never had to worry about anything. I'm not too bad looking (or so I'm told), I'm at least intelligent enough to have become a PHD and enter an industry were I earn good money. I have friends, a wife, a kid. 

On paper, I have everything to live a happy life.

But I'm not happy. I'm actually deeply unhappy and depressed. 

I came to the realisation, with help of a therapist, that throughout my whole live, I never made decisions. Even worse, I never even THOUGHT about different possibilities which I could decide for. I'm just water flowing down the river, taking the path of least resistance to wherever it leads me. And I hate it. I went to college, studied something because my friends studied it. The job I got I took because this was the company that employed me, not because I was particularly interested in it. When a discussion comes up, I often just agree because I don't want to take sides. Go to this restaurant? I don't care, let's just go. Vacation? Wherever you want. Work project? Sure I'll take it, why not. But I won't be happy doing any of it, I'll just do it.

I never experienced the ""high"" of successfully completing a project, a milestone, whatever. It's just ""meh"" for me. 

I never had the guts to pursue my dreams. Hell, I can't even name my dreams.

96,"i was at a party this weekend, a rarity for me over the past few years, but getting back out has felt good in some ways.

i saw the most beautiful girl there. i fell for her, again. i've seen her throughout the years before at other parties, though i don't quite recall completely. she's the kind of girl i just look at and admire, and really enjoy doing so. i love her accent and listening to her talk. she talks a lot about things that i personally connect with and would love to sit around and talk to her about. 

i remember one time, a long time ago now, she called me out on staring at her. i got embarrassed at first, because i hadn't noticed i was staring, and i thought maybe she was calling me a creep or something at first. but she didn't mind, and said she kinda liked it. i just told her how i felt, and what i was thinking, which is that she's just a really beautiful attractive person, who i enjoy listening to talk in a way that carries me in and out of my own thoughts. and that i had kind of wished things were different.

she's always had a long-term boyfriend, and they're married now and all. even besides that, i would find it difficult to believe a relationship with her is within the realm of possibility for me. not given how i see myself or anything, but just the complexity of my own circumstance. 

i don't even remember her name, and it's probably just better off that way anyway. i remember we spoke briefly a few of the other times years before, though i don't remember completely the nature of our conversations. only that she was kind and accepting, and i enjoyed talking to her as much as i enjoyed listening to her talk about her family, friends, or w/e 

i haven't been able to stop thinking about her. it always ends up the same way. i see her at a party, fall in love, can't stop thinking about her for a few weeks, then stuff happens, and i just move on. until the next random time i see her at a party around somewhere.

i'd love to be embraced by her, and i sometimes wonder if she would want to. then i remember i'm a poor piece of shit, in too much debt, in way over my head dealing with a lot of violence and fucked up shit that i've struggled to get away from for my entire life.

it's nice to wonder sometimes though, how things could be otherwise. this kind of wondering does leave me feeling lonely, but it's not bad feels to just wonder and imagine. 

it was a good night, though definitely emotionally/mentally taxing, and a bit strange in some other ways that i'm not sure i can put my finger on it, i don't think it's in a bad way. i dno. it was just good to get out of the house and be somewhere else, out of town, that was a safe and comfortable space. i got to see a few people i haven't seen in a long time, it was nice to catch up",12Sep2019,4

My phone is being repaired and meanwhile I'm using a replacement phone. I paid a 100 euro security deposit, and would get it back when i return the phone unharmed.

I don't know anywhere where they can replace this particular phone, so I might as well do it myself.

Hey guys,

I have posted here the last few days and been talking about how I am 5 years sober and so pumped about it, but tonight I really want to talk to people and answer questions if I can. I love talking about my issues and talking to people about their issues and I absolutely love trying to have open discussions about what we struggle with collectively.

I think its so important to have an open conversation about mental health to show others that we are Not Alone. That has been a really big focus of mine for the past years and a half.

I struggle with anxiety, depression, seasonal affective disorder, and ADHD and am hoping to have my largest conversation yet tonight if everyone could tune in with me (: you can click my link and follow but the most important thing you could do is just **set a reminder to come watch tonight at 6:00 EST**

112,"I use to be the biggest gamer of all time. I would enjoy any game. I don’t even watch soccer and I would love to play the games. But after I graduated high school, I never had the motivation to play games. Feeling confused I kept trying to force myself to play games. I can’t do it anymore, it feels to much like a chore . Now all I do is watch YouTube all day. I feel like I’m going through a small depression. Sucks going to work and not looking forward to anything right after. Been playing games since I was 4 years old. Is it just burnout? I feel like almost 8 years is a long time for a burnout. I’ve also tried so many different activities and it all felt like a chore .

113,"*I know this post is on the longer side, but I promise it’s worth the read.*

Wednesday, September 11th, 2019.

I finally discovered the secret to living life. It’s all about the ego. I’ve heard of ego for my entire life, but after watching a YouTube video about it earlier today, it finally clicked. I understand that the ego is just an illusion, and it can be separated from yourself through meditation and/or psychedelics. I completely understand why shrooms can cure depression, anxiety, addiction, etc. *Side note: my first shroom trip was three days ago.* This medicine temporarily dissolves your ego, but the lessons learned from a trip can have lasting and permanent effects. Shrooms make you realize that the ego is an illusion and that the actual truth lies beyond anything within the beliefs in our ego. All our thoughts are not real. The real truth is that the universe is one connected thing, and we are just a part of it. We are all in this together. There is no reason to make judgements, there is no reason to be angry, there is no reason to have enemies, to hold grudges, to be anxious, or to spread hate. Nothing is good, nothing is bad; everything just is.

These concepts go along with what I learned about anxiety during my mushroom trip. *Another side note: I learned on Tuesday that I need to accept my anxiety instead of ignore it, which is what I was doing my entire life.* My social anxiety is a part of me, but it just lives in the ego. My anxious thoughts are just that: thoughts. They are not real, they are not good, they are not bad. It’s just a part of my ego that I can be aware of. If I am able to separate myself from my ego, my anxious thoughts will just be thoughts. I don’t have to let them control me.

All of these realizations about life have helped me understand religion. Before today, I thought religion was foolish since there is no evidence that God(s) exist(s). But now I know that the oneness of the universe is a very real thing. That’s what God is, that’s what Buddha is, that’s what (most) religions worship: the oneness of the universe. Spiritual practice is just a way for people to feel that, as well as a way to dissolve the ego. Different religions are just different pathways to reach the same type of enlightenment. Again, there is no reason to judge anyone for choosing any religion. Religion is simply a guide to a life lived well and selflessly. And—random thought—selflessness is just another way to describe the act of not satisfying your ego. Another random thought: the devil in Christianity is symbolic to temptation, and temptation is about, again, satisfying your ego.

It all makes sense; life makes sense. I’m so excited to live a full life with this knowledge. I’m hyped that I have this figured out at only eighteen years old. Life’s gonna be nice, I know it.

I like to end all my journal entries with a quote: “Q: How does the ego handle truth? A: The larger the ego, the less truth can be handled. Arriving at total Truth is the end of ago altogether.” - Leland Lewis",12Sep2019,4
115,"I don't feel much anymore, at least not in the positive sense. Not just happiness, it goes for anything, even fun. I'm bored all the time and evenings are just grey and dull. I started drinking sometimes just to feel, but oddly enough even alcohol doesn't do it like it did when I was younger. I don't feel sad either. The only thing I kind of feel is anxiety.

I put on emotional songs and emotional videos to feel something other than anxiety and dullness. It helps. I want to be sad just to feel.

I listen to motivational videos as well on a loop because it sometimes does something to, wakes something up. And if I find interesting educational videos on really great people, also helps, like the one on the front page recently on Alan Turing.

But mostly just sad songs.",12Sep2019,1
116,"I've been studying special effects make-up for the past two years and I absolutely love it. I wouldn't say I'm the best, but I definitely feel like I have enough skills to make it my main job. The thing is, I'm absolutely terrified of actually finishing anything related to this school. I'm supposed to graduate in about two weeks and I'm so paralysed with fear I wasn't able to do anything until this week. I used to study English at a university and I dropped out after two years because of how bad my mental health was at the time. There was a point where I haven't spoken a word in months and because of that I'm very soft spoken which only fuels my anxiety. I can't focus on anything because the only thing I can think about is how I'm too weak to actually finish anything.

Also, my mother wants to come with me to record everything and take pictures and I can't stand that, she's very controlling and loves to interfere when I'm working. I told her today that I'm afraid to take her with me just because I don't want to stress about her behaviour and what she's going to do(which my therapist agreed that it's fine to let her know how I feel) and she got extremely upset and wouldn't talk to me for a whole day. I don't know what to do and how to motivate myself to actually finish everything.

I'm sorry, I don't feel confident enough to vent about these stuff to any of my friends so I just need to put it out somewhere.",12Sep2019,3

120,"Just a disclaimer I am new to posting and I'm not even sure if this is a good place for this as it is sexual in nature but here it goes...

A little background on me: I am a 25yo male with a now severe case of social anxiety. I started using porn at an early age (6th grade) and a year after that I started to be romantically involved with girls. At the end of middle school I began a relationship with a girl that would last until my freshman year of college. During this time I continued to watch porn on a near daily basis. My girlfriend and I experimented with the basic stuff (touching/oral sex) but didn't have sex until we were 16/17. When the time finally came to lose our virginities I struggled to get an erection. This had never been an issue before. She cried and I turned to the internet for answers. At a young age, I learned of porn-induced erectile dysfunction. Looking back I believe it was simply performance anxiety, as I now realize I have always dealt with what I would consider strong anxiety. Anyway like I said we dated for many years and the problem only flared up occasionally. All this time I continued using porn. 

In college, my social phobia really took a hold of me and it was incredibly hard for me to socialize and even go to classes. I became terrified I would lose her and ended up pushing her away. She dumped me and I began to spiral. I rebounded immediately and got in a relationship with a girl I barely knew that was centered around sex and partying. Also, my ED would occasionally flare up, or I would PE. I developed a chronic marijuana habit and started binge drinking. I ended up dropping out of college. 

Still devastated by my first relationship ending, I began to drink more and have a lot of casual sex, culminating in me getting chlamydia. I dealt with that and decided enough is enough and to look for a serious relationship. At this point I depended on alcohol to talk to girls because my anxiety was so bad. I met a nice girl and when it came to have sex I orgasmed almost immediately. I was humiliated and felt so much shame. After that I couldn't get an erection. It's been two years since I last tried to have a relationship with a girl. My porn use became a multiple times per day problem and my tastes became more and more hardcore. I ended up turning to things like bisexual orgies to get off. For the first time in my life I began fearing I must be gay. It drives me insane because my brain is telling me one thing but I just don't get horny anymore thinking about real sex. 

My theory is that the increased use of porn has warped my brain, coupled with an increasingly stronger fear of women. I tend to attach to girls very easily and relationships have caused me so much pain in the past. When I see attractive women I long to be able to start a relationship, but the fear that I either won't get an erection or I will cum instantly stops me from even being able to talk to a girl. 

I just don't know what is happening to me. It has been 24 days since I last used porn and I have been seeing a therapist for a few months. I guess I just hope someone here can help me.",12Sep2019,7

125,"I was in the kitchen at work grabbing my Trader Joe's Palak Paneer out of the freezer when Karen\* walks in and says, ""Oh, Dee, tell me you don't eat frozen dinners"" in this ""I'm so disappointed in you"" tone. 

I gave her a look that I hope said *Are you fucking kidding me right now?* and told her ""I do, so what?"" 

She said ""There's so much sodium in those things!"" and she grabbed the box out of my hands to look at the nutritional information.  I said ""I don't care,"" and grabbed it back.  She basically tut-tutted me again and I repeated that it didn't matter to me, and she walked out with her lunch, which I'm sure was some clean, macro, paleo/keto pile of twigs and raw meat or something.  

It really pissed me off.  I eat mostly vegetarian and I try to eat a healthy diet, but I would never say anything to anyone about what they choose to eat (unless it's my dad and I need to tell him that eating a whole box of Nature Valley granola bars in one day is definitely not good for him).  I thought about a bunch of things I could say to her to excuse eating one frozen dinner, but fuck it, it's literally none of her damn business.  She knows absolutely nothing about my life or my health and I'm not justifying anything to her.  If she ever says anything to me again I'm just going to tell her that her comments are not welcome and she should keep her thoughts to herself. 

Anyway, that's my rant.  I really felt like going over to her desk and giving her a piece of my mind, but getting my frustration out on Reddit is probably a better idea from an HR perspective.  Anybody else ever have issues with people at work sticking their noses in your personal business?

126,"I foolishly took a peek at the news today and found out Trump is repealing the WOTUS rule which is a newly developed part of the Clean Water Act and I just can’t take it any more. 

Regardless of my stance on politics or distaste for him, it is EXTREMELY obvious that Trump is starting to develop dementia but no one bats an eye. I’ve never heard the man form a cohesive sentence and it’s getting worse. He gets confused easily and his attendants have to lead him hand and foot to his next obligation. He incites violence at his rallies and does nonsensical things. No one has even thought to give him a psyche eval and they won’t until it’s too late for the guy. I don’t care for him at all but I’d imagine someone would, he’s the fucking president. 

But that’s the kicker. Who better to serve the needs of the Government than a man with no sensibility? He’s just the perfect scapegoat for every one to blame after his term is over.

The president can’t repeal a law, that’s congress’ job. I’ve never heard any one complain about congress during a president’s term; it’s always the one individual every one gets mad at and calls a ‘bad’ president, and even now the media is attaching the presidents name to something he legally cannot do on his own. The executive branch is the only one we ever hold accountable for causing dismay, even though there are two other branches that we could argue have way more jurisdiction than the executive branch. But every one will have sympathy for Trump once he goes senile and he won’t be held accountable for anything. So congress, as always, gets away scott fucking free AND on top of that conservatives don’t look as bad. The same idiots that have been ruining our country for the past 30-40 years are just going to keep doing what they do and we’ll expect the next president to facilitate some kind of great change.

127,"I would like to know random thoughts on how my idea will benefit society, how it will NOT be good for society, how it can be adjusted and maybe work better. ANY input will be appreciated thanks....ENJOY lol
Ok, I will try be accurate &amp; short....
This idea I have will ONLY work if WE ALL JOIN, UNITE AND ASK FOR IT TO HAPPEN.....
Ok, we will ask as MANY athletes and Celebrities to JOIN our cause as we all unite forna better America.
Once MANY,MANY,MANY athletes show interest and join the movement we can begin by setting a date and ASKING all the athletes and stars to create a GOFUNDME .....this GOFUNDME  can be called.... EVERYTIME IT REACHES 100,000 CASH....1 PERSON WILL RECIEVE THE 100,000 CASH)
Ok, here is how this GODUNDME CELEBRITY EMPOWERMENT CHALLENGE WORKS.
Everytime a CELEBRITIES Gofundme reaches 100,000 Cash in donation ...THEY now select 1 person from the STATE in USA that the celebrity was raised at, then again the gofundme goes to ZERO and repeats...everytime the GOFUNDME reaches 100,000 then AGAIN another person will be given the 100,000 cash..... the CHALLENGE is to see WHAT artist, athletes celebrity can create the MOST 100,000 dollar people withing THEIR particular state. EXAMPLE ....Micheal Jordan joins the movement because HE wishes to make CHICAGO great again.... everytime HIS gofundme reaches 100,000 CASH ...then 1 person in Chicago can recieve the 100,000 cash....then LEBON JAMES sees how Jordan is making Chicago great, NOW Lebron James joins and creates his own gofundme and when we all donate and it reaches 100,000 cash...lebron James selects 1 person from Ohio to give the 100,000 cash.... Serena Williams sees these athletes empowering locals in their neighborhood and SHE also want to make her old neighborhood proud so SHE also creates HER gofundme and when it reaches 100,000 cash donations ....NOW she can select 1 person from  Florida where she grew up, her gofundme then goes back to Zero and when it reaches 100,000 AGAIN she can select another person in Florida to give the 100,000 cash..... once ALL THE PEOPLE recieve this 100,000 cash they MUST come forward and tell EVERYBODY that this is real and NOT a scam...once there is transparency MORE people will join and support THEIR FAVORITE athlete or celebrity from THEIR STATE.....or ANYBODY FROM ANYWHERE CAN DONATE TO THEIR FAVORITE CELEBRITY....HOWEVER when the gofundme reches 100,000 cash donations ...then the 1 person selected MUST be from THE state that the celebrity is REPRESENTING.. ...example ANYBODY in the world can donate to Oprahs Gofundme BUT....she can only choose 1 person from the very state SHE is representing and thats usually gonna be the state that they grew up in.
The idea is to have over 100 celebrities with this CELEBRITY EMPOWERMENT GOFUNDME CHALLENGE in FULL EFFECT......  the challenge is to see who can produce the most 100,000 cash people in the state THEY represent...THUS HELPING MAKE THEIR STATE BETTER.
All celebrities have 1 million followers....OR MORE....but 1 million for sure because example ....in my state we are 11 million....but for sure I know 1 million atleast LOVE AND ADMIRE AND TRUST Lebron James..... he has MORE around the world that could help and donate...but lets pretend ONLY 1 million because we from Ohio want to help make Ohio better.... so 1 million Ohio residents all donate 5 dollars to lebrons GOFUNDME..... now Lebron can select 50 people from OHIO to donate 100,000 cash to 50 people !!! How....because 5 million ÷ 100,000 cash = 50 people
Another example.... CHICAGO needs help bad....and we know micheal Jordan has 5 million follower that really want him to help Chicago...so 5 million people × 5 dollar donation to Jordans gofundme = 25 million And now divide that by 100,000 cash = that now 250 people from the state of Illinoise will recieve 100,000 CASH each to try and make The state a better one..... NOW....all celebrities have these million followers...all different because of ...well..... artist, some follow and love baseball stars, some will only support their favorite basketball star...some will donate to their actors gofundme..... all in all ..... there should be MULTIPLE celebrities in all 50 states.....
If they are all doing this.....WILL THIS IDEA HELP THE USA ?",12Sep2019,1

So I (19) am into this woman. We are acquaintances and the details don’t matter too much... however, I am in a position where I have next to no idea how she feels/would feel about me romantically. I want to just bite the bullet and ask her if she’d like to go out sometime, and the worst she could say is no thank you. But for some reason, now and in the past, I have sat idly by (sometimes for YEARS) because I am afraid to ask the person that I am interested in if they want to go out. (Seriously, I was really into this girl I went to high school with for many years and I never once told her, because I didn’t know if she felt the same. Now I will never know.) 

I would much rather just be able to tell if there was any chance at all - because if I could tell even in the slightest degree, I’d be way more comfortable taking that chance. 

I dont know why I am so afraid, because no one has harshly rejected me in the past and I have no reason to think she would. Rejection is rejection, but ultimately it’s something normal that I am totally able to handle. So what gives?

So, I suppose my **TLDR** is: how do you work up the courage to ask someone out when you aren’t sure at all if they’re interested in you?

My prof interpreted this as me finding a similar lab online, and copying an abstract for it, as she was aware of such a lab that used mass instead of density.  I was taken aside and told of this possibility and giving a stern warning, which I assume is preceding some sort of greater action.  

Of course, I didn't actually plagiarize my abstract.  It would've been the most pointless act of plagiarism too, since I was essentially paraphrasing the lab procedure from something *she* gave to the class.

I used to waste so much time on reddit but I use my new account very mindfully now. 

I used to care so much what people thought, if I would ever be accepted by society. I'm over it, good riddance.

I wish everyone well even when they don't wish me well, I can see their insecurities in plain view. 

I was 180 pounds two years ago but I am a slim and slender 150 now, not caring how it looks at all. 

I used to get so worked up in /r/nfl over games and now I just crack jokes with the other people cracking jokes. 

I could go on and on and on. It's so relieving to be in a completely new place in life after all I've been through.",12Sep2019,1

I have quit my vices (weed, drinking), given up meat and processed foods too.

I have built a company without any funding or marketing without a degree.

147,"He’s always been difficult. He was never there for me emotionally when I was a kid and he gets agitated/annoyed really easily. I’ve spent my life trying to manage his feelings and I still do it now (I’m 33!). Anyway, today I realised that constantly trying to make him feel better is exhausting and it’ll never turn him into the father I want him to be so what’s the point! I feel sad but I also feel like a weights been lifted.",12Sep2019,10
148,"I won't go into detail about what's been going on, but long story short, I got romantically involved with someone who had bad intentions. I promised myself I wouldn't obsess about him here, but when a hateful toxic person invades your life like this, it's easy to want to shut everyone off. I have spent a lot of time locked in my room in bed because of this man. 

I thought if I took myself to shopping and lunch I would feel better. I did for a bit. New lingerie does the trick for a while, and wearing a pretty dress helped me get my head up a little higher. My friend suggested I download Tinder to help me get some self esteem back because she promised I could do better. 99+ likes in one night did help a bit, but once again, that was temporary. 

What really made my heart feel warm again was when I was talking to my therapist, the mellowest, most soft spoken man, and his face radiated the most kindness as I cried in front of him and told him how hurt I was. He said it hurt him to see me hurt. We've only had one session, but I could see the genuine care in this man's eyes. Not only then did I realize that not all people were awful, but it is love and kindness that heals the ugly things. 

What's been feeding my heart is giving love. I gave my parrots extra treats. They're getting a bedtime story tonight too. I've been playing with the neighbor's cats. I'm planning on knitting some toys for my cat. I was extra nice at work to people who might have normally stressed me out. I helped an older lady put email on her phone. I let the math professor who no one seems to like tell me about his passion for numbers. I left snacks for my friends. I told a friend I loved her. I helped a foreign exchange student feel more at home. I'm going to paint something for my shared desk at work. I smiled at everyone. I wished everyone in customer service a good day. I shared my chips in class. I gave someone a hug. 

I was sad because I wanted that man to like me because I had something to offer. I wanted him to make me feel like I was worth something. Well, he didn't, but now I know I do have something to offer. I felt it today when I gave instead of asking to receive.",12Sep2019,15
150,"So I know pc is much better than Xbox and it’s not really the Xbox that is making me feel bad, it’s the fact that my parents spent who knows how much money on my Xbox and games and all those things and I just ditched it at first sight of my pc and that makes me feel really bad about it because there is nothing I can do to to get their money back and I feel like a made them feel like their efforts are worth nothing",12Sep2019,1
151,"I'm a 22 year old male who is in love with a girl. I live in Iran. So you can imagine how much our culture has restrictions on us!. Anyway she is a Muslim and I'm an ex-muslim. I don't believe in any God. This is the difference which she has accepted. I mean she says she doesn't have a problem to commit sin for me. If I want to get marry with her I should act like a Muslim in front of her family!! I nearly told her anything to her. I have to wait for three years to get marry to her. My problem is sex! I know it sounds crazy and trivial but it is important. Lol I'm going crazy. We talked about some sex stuff that we would do in the future and she said she won't go down on me!!! And I love to go down on her. She didn't know that girls could masturbating!!!. I'm with her for six months and all we did was kissing. I'm totally fine with it but I wish she was an atheist like me. 
Sometimes I tell myself maybe I shouldn't have fell in love or at least I should not have talked about marriage. I feel guilty. Not about her but myself mostly. My other problem is my future, this shitty future that I have to wait. I don't have a job. I feel so overwhelmed. Why did I born in Iran. Why????",12Sep2019,1
