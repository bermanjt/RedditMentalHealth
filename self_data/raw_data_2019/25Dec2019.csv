So, if you are struggling this Christmas, please feel free to reach out here, in a DM, whatever.  Let's take care of each other at the end of the decade!",25Dec2019,1

4,"So I joined the military to move. I currently live in Arkansas. I am not a fan. So I joined to travel. After basic I got my duty station and guess where I got stationed ARKANSAS. Lucky right? 

One thing I’m thankful for even though I hate it here is that my family is an hour away. I visit them a lot, and on the holidays I get to have a family dinner unlike my coworkers. For thanksgiving I invited my friend whom I met through bumble she’s here for a year working as an au pair from South Africa. But for Christmas she was going to stay with her host family so I invited half of my coworkers to my family dinner. I felt awkward a few hours ago bc I don’t want them all to be sitting around while we’re opening things so I went to the store and bought a bunch more stuff. 

Even though I didn’t get what I wanted for joining (to move) I’m thankful that I get to share my family with my brothers and sisters in arms who don’t get to be near their families. I haven’t figured out my reasoning for getting Arkansas but the holidays always make me happy. 

If anyone has nothing going on tomorrow I’m sure most of you are far from me but DM me and I’ll keep you company for the holiday we can have a convo or something.",25Dec2019,1
5,"Ok, let’s summarize a little bit what 2019 meant to me so you could understand the title when the post ends.

I (28M) started this year deeply depressed, drowning in anxiety due to my job and my recently finished relationship with my only serious girlfriend (25F) (almost 5 years). I was working at least 12h a day in something that I really liked but they didn’t pay, as it was a startup so...an eternal success promise was always floating over our heads but never falling into our hands. It was really frustrating for me as my parents had to help me to pay the rent and food if I still wanted to pursue my dream -so to speak, not a believer of dreams-. I felt that I failed to them as they helped me and were really supportive and understanding with everything I did. 

At some point in 2019 March I decided to go for therapy, because my ex’s shadow was always above me, I was super unhappy with our situation and it was almost unbearable. I have to mention that during 2 and a half years, our relationship was long distance as I was working in a different city that her work was. She told me in one occasion that she didn’t like the city I was in, and didn’t want to move there. Our relationship ended on October 2018 via phone with me crying like a child because I didn’t know what was wrong with me, my anxiety was winning, and she thinking I was weak as fuck because my mental state was far from what it was when our relationship started (something that her mother used to mention aaall the time). I didn’t know if I still loved her (I reckon I still do?).

After two months of therapy I was way better in professional terms, I realised that this promising startup was just a toxic environment and it wasn’t helping me at all with my anxiety problem, so I decided to leave that work and start (again) to do some workouts (I really like lifting weights despite I’m not strong at all, It’s just a stress relief for me). That was one of the best decisions of my 2019 and my life. I started interviewing different positions and finally got a job in a new company and country in August. I was really excited. 

During this time my ex used to text me to ask if I was okay, and this particular occurrence made me feel weak. Like she was feeling pity for me or something like that. Meanwhile she was super happy with her new life, travelling, meeting new people, loooots of photos in social media, I felt like shit in personal terms. Was I that bad? I realised that yes, our relationship was toxic because I was super insecure and jealous after and during my stress/anxiety problems. Asked her not to write me so I could get over her because I still had feelings for her and told her I was super sorry about my behaviour in some points during our relationship. She didn’t give much importance to that stuff. I still do, because I think I’ve learnt and improved in those regards.

I moved to the new country on October. My anxiety today is totally under control and in professional terms I couldn’t ask for more. Not in personal terms though. And here begins the main topic.

For Christmas I came back to my childhood town, where my parents live. Here is where we (my ex and I) used to hang out during our relationship. I feel suuuper alone here, having some relatives that are divorced or just single being in his 40s has me super insecure again because I just don’t want to be that alone in the future. Here I am always remembering her, thinking that I would be happier with her, feeling shit mostly. All my successes in professional field are eclipsed by this particular thing. I just can’t move on 1 and a half year after we broke up. I’ve tried to meet new people, but I just can’t feel the same way I felt for her for anyone else. I just can’t. I think I still love her, and coming back to the places I’ve been happy with her is hurting big time and I cannot avoid coming back here because my parents are also here, and they’re the only important thing that I’ve got in personal terms.

Of course sometimes I feel like a picky child having 28 yo and not knowing how to get over an ex, while at the same time I feel I’ve maybe idealised her or something.",25Dec2019,1

16,"Ok, so I'm a 26 year old Father of two kids (7 and 5), married for 3 years, been together for 8 with my wife. We aren't ""well off"" but we get by and I like yo think I do a good enough job providing for my family.

 I've battled with clinical depression for the better part of a decade, since I lost my mom when I was 16. I just passed the decade mark, and it has really wrecked me. Everything has come back up again like it happened yesterday.

On top of that I've had just a terrible Christmas Eve. Had to work, had to miss going to a movie with my wife and kids, missed going to the pool with them. It feels like the rest of my family is off enjoying Christmas and I'm stuck.

I tried to talk to my wife, but every time I try to tell her why I feel this way, she just comes back with what makes her upset and it feels like she doesn't even want to listen to me. All I want is to talk to her about what I'm feeling without feeling guilty afterwards.

What do I do here? I feel like I'm losing myself, my depression meds take the edge off, but not at this time of year.

18,"This is a long story that I am going to try and keep as short as I can. Basically, there's this girl I met on Tinder who I hit it off with, at least over text. After getting some small talk out of the way, we decided to call and talk to each other that way. It's been about three weeks or so since then, and all I have to say is, ever since our first phone call, this girl basically has made me feel like I am two feet tall. Now look, I'm not one to normally play the victim, and I'm not trying to here at all. But we just do not jive the way I was hoping we would. She has a very sarcastic tone and it's just hard to take her seriously sometimes, whereas I am a much softer, serious, down to earth, very emotional guy who prefers talking about his feelings as well as having others share *their* feelings with *me*.

People say that I'm really good at opening other people up/helping them come out of their shell, and I'm just having some trouble doing it with her I guess. I can tell she's been hurt in the past, and it's due to her past experiences that she has trouble letting me in. You might just be thinking to yourself that maybe she just doesn't like me, but she's made it very clear that she in fact does and hopes a relationship would work between us one day (just putting that out there).

But the TL;DR is, so long as I'm being 100% genuine self (which she has made clear that she wants me to be), this girl is insatiable. Normally I would just not waste my time and skip this one, moving on to a girl who actually builds me up and encourages me to do better as a person, becuase that's what a relationship is: building each other up and supporting each other. But this girl does not do that. She (indirectly) depricates me. I've addressed this with her and she's apologized for it before, claiming that she's ""working on not being so harsh with her words"".

Now look, I knew from the very start that we weren't going to work out. I think we'd make terrific friends, but committing to her is just not something I can see myself doing; we just don't ""gel"" with each other very well at all. I think what's making me stick around though is the fact that she **does** compliment me once in awhile and has told me that she's surprised that I haven't been ""scared off"" or ""driven away"" by her yet, and I want to show her that I'm different. So as I pursue this girl who I really shouldn't be, I ask that you, reading this (if you made it this far), wish me the best of luck. I'm going to need a lot of patience to get through to someone like this. But I'm not going to give up. Maybe one day I will throw in the towel, but for now, I still want to at least **try.**

Thanks for reading. Those are my thoughts. Have a great day!",25Dec2019,1

20,"17M

From 2016-2018 I would listen to lots of heavy electronic music and hip-hop on full volume with headphones, so loud someone sitting across the room from me could hear it. After I popped a cheap pair of headphones in mid 2016 from such a high volume, I got a pair of high-end bass boost headphones and kept on going.

By late 2017 I started getting really bad headaches from all the music. It wasn't just from headphones, but from speakers a reasonable distance from me in my living room too. A normal volume would also cause pain.

I noticed that I wouldn't feel so bad if I avoided music, but that was around the time I realized that music was my true passion. I started to experiment with making my own music. As my love of music grew, so did my pain. Messing around with digital synthesizers and drums was a terrible idea.

I started getting ringing in my ears for a few minutes at a time. Sometimes an ear would pop and I would be deaf in it or only hear a sharp buzzing sound for a good 30 seconds. This was almost always followed with a migraine. I was terrified. I was so afraid of going deaf.

So in early 2018, I told myself I would not listen to or make any music ever again. Aside from growing depressed, I felt better. But my love turned into an addiction and I eventually came back to music as soon as my favorite artists had new songs. I couldn't stay away.

I've been listening to the same insane music on and off for 2 years now and I always have migraines. Probably 3-5 a week. I would never get headaches until 2017 and now they're constant. I deal with them by applying peppermint oil to my forehead, but it's not sustainable. Sometimes I give in and take an Alieve if it's completely unbearable.

Ironically, vinyl records don't cause this problem.

My therapist told me I need a healthy relationship with music, but I've said no, as I know that anything with even a little bit of bass could cause problems. I plan to swear off all music in 2020 and never purposefully listen to any music ever again. I know it's extreme and I'll be so tempted to relapse, but I need to do it.

I currently have a migraine and it's SO ANNOYING. I know I should go to a doctor, but I want to see what other people think beforehand. I've been known to have qualities of a hypochondriac before, but this is different.

My Dad plays even crazier music than I do (hard bass and underground metal) and I'm always spending time with him. It would be impossible to avoid all heavy music. I can't just tell him to quit with me.

I do think my ""addiction"" to music is rooted in anxiety and depression. I am very dissatisfied with my life, have no hope for the future, and no close relationships. It's so amazing and euphoric just to sit and do nothing but blast music all day. It's the best high I've ever had, but I hate myself for it.

I just really don't want to lose my hearing or get progressively worse. God forbid I get extreme noise sensitivity where I have a heat attack when someone simply uses their voice. I've heard the horror stories. Tinnitus is awful.

Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.

P.S. I've tried earplugs and they sorta work, but they're obnoxious. I can't just wear them all the time. It's also impractical.

21,I'm crushing so damn hard on this girl. She truly feels like one in a million to me.,25Dec2019,1
22,"She has some ambitions in life, but oh man, she's dumb. Zero willpower. Zero work ethic. She hates her job, so she's studying to move to a new area but guess what? She calls me almost every single day saying that she can't study because it's too hard, she's boring and so on. Totally mediocre.

She likes to travel, but most of the time she wants to spend almost no money and stay at a shitty hotel. I hate traveling, but she doesn't want to go alone (even when I said so). Fuck.

She has almost no sense of style (actually she trusts me to pick good and reliable things because she just can't choose right) and she still dresses like a fucking teenager... We're way over 20 and I wear clothes like a grown-man, while she still uses sneakers all the time. The gifts (clothes) that she gave me are fucking ugly. It was better for her to save her money instead of buying shit like this.

She has no other hobbies other than travel and we don't even travel that much... Besides liking to travel, she CAN'T, ABSOLUTELY CAN'T plan properly. She doesn't take into consideration flights, how long it is gonna take to get to one place and so on... Jesus Christ, how can someone be so clueless about everything?

Can you fucking believe it that when she met me a couple of years ago she wasn't using any birth control pills? Yet, she had sex with one guy without even using condoms (lots of years ago before she met me – we are tested and we are clear). It was ME who said to her to take the pills otherwise we would be over. It was ME that called her everyday at 3pm reminding her to take her fucking birth control pill... and guess what? As soon as I stopped calling, she managed to fuck up and forgot one pill.

Music and movies? Nope. When we are watching some movies and I'm super excited, she asks: ""why is this guy doing that?"" and I have to literally explain what's happening on the screen. She doesn't seem to understand things that are not right in front of her most of the time. She doesn't enjoy music too, which is a huge thing for me. I can talk and talk and talk about a band, trying to get her excited at least just a little, but nope. She just listens and eventually says: ""oh, cool"".

She's too dependent. To be honest? I don't think that she will ever evolve in life. She left her hometown because it was boring, but I don't think that she should have ever left there. She belongs there.

And what about sex? LOL! I swear to God, it's one of the cringiest things that I ever saw. I don't think that this woman can be sexy even for the first man on earth who has never seen a woman before. Bad taste plays a huge part here... I feel like I'm fucking a woman from the 15th century because her lingerie is ridiculous. Zero moves too. Ridiculous... we fuck only 1 time a month and that's more than enough for me.

The sound of her laughing is like a Hiena dying of asthma.

I don't know what I was thinking when I proposed to her a couple of years ago. She's one of the most **unremarkable** people that I know. She's average (and below average) in almost everything – from her looks to her personality.",25Dec2019,1
23," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ on email replies and said it in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. Sometimes she will ask me something related to jobs etc then when is she whatever is ya she will abruptly reply ‘did yer’ in what seems a snotty/sarcastic way 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

After she broke up with me. I started seeing a therapist, started working out, eating better, started reading. Basically taking several steps to get my life and my emotions back on track.

Necessities which come with having children. She threatened to put me in foster care several times and honestly I just wish she did. I’m eighteen now but it doesn’t matter to her. My wants and personal needs don’t matter. 

I’m an artist. My stupid arse drew a picture of her dead dog for her birthday present this year and she’s been all over it since. I regret letting her in. I knew she’d ruin it. But I did it anyway. For Christmas she demanded a picture of our living dog. I was drawing a picture oh my friends dog for her, somebody who I value so much more than my mother. I didn’t want her knowing about it but stupid me told her. I don’t like drawing things like this one after the other; it’s tiring and draining. I need breaks. My brain doesn’t work the way she wants it to. 

I was trying to finish her picture tonight but things kept going wrong. I got chemically pigments smudged everywhere (I use a liquid blend to get Smooth blending with my coloured pencils) so I couldn’t erase it. Pencil went everywhere. I colour matched poorly on his muzzle and couldn’t life any of it. I just. Wasn’t happy with it. It was a mess. I’d been working weeks on it and it was ugly. And messy. I wasn’t happy. So I ended up finishing a picture of some poppies I never finished for her. As her favourite flowers are poppies, she liked what I’d done so far and wanted it when I’d finished. Because she wants Every picture I draw. I can’t have anything for myself. (But when I offer it as a sale, she decides that it isn’t fair as she’s my mother and shouldn’t have to Pay). I hadn’t bought her anything as I was relying on a picture that was at one point going well. I am unable to afford it anyway, my job has cut all our hours back. 

She recently spent the last of our savings on a tattoo for herself. Then say crying to me saying we couldn’t afford Christmas. “The divorce money wasn’t for looking after you”. Well okay then. My art isn’t for you. None of this is for you. I didn’t want to draw you the dog. I TOLD HER. I fucking TOLD her I didn’t want to do it. This was back in November. 

So on the sixth of December my dog was put down. She died in my arms. She was sixteen, I’m eighteen. She had been my best friend for years. Been there through everything. The only thing I considered family. I lost Everything. I didn’t want to finish my friends picture. I didn’t want to do my mother’s. I didn’t want to look at my dog, let alone the shitty reference she wanted it from. 

I know I’ll get guilted tomorrow. I sat up until 3am trying to fix this picture. Finished the other not long ago. Coming up to 4am. She is going to give me so much shit. And I really, really am not looking forward to it. But honestly. Why should I bother, when I know that tomorrow I won’t wake up to anything. No. I’ll wake up to a paper cutter she bought for £6 (I was there; was going to buy it myself) and if I’m lucky £20 to put towards a Switch.

I came to visit because “it’s the holidays” and all. My boyfriend and all my friends are out of town. My mom just hit the dog again. Ugh. I have never had a good time during the holidays because it’s always an excuse for my parents to get drunk. I would just not go but I live so close that it’d be a real terrible faux pas if I just didn’t show. Dad just got home and fell down the stairs. Not far enough haha. Any happy feelings about the holidays have been stained by all their bullshit and abuse. I mean, it doesn’t matter since I don’t actually live with them on a day to day basis but being home just makes me so anxious and scared.

34,"My mom for a while now has been using that she was the perfect child against me. She never talked back, got perfect grades, and was in every AP class and even was a high position in band. This hurts, a lot, especially when my grades are usually like roller coasters, I mean sure I don’t try as hard as I should but good grades have never interested me and is a lot of work. Along with that my brothers and I are fairly crazy and rough house a lot even if sometimes it leads to tears. My mom cannot stand this and doesn’t seem to understand why her kids are so crazy when she was so perfect and tells us this a lot. I think that when she had us she thought we d also be perfect and parenting would be a walk in the park but 16 years later and we still drive her nuts. She expected a lot from us/me and Im constantly reminded of how much of a failure I am. I would be one of those kids in high school that she wouldn’t look twice at and scoff at. I have a wonderful home, loving parents, we re not poor or in need of money, so it feels so wrong for me to feel depressed and I feel so guilty every time I cry because there are people with a lot less than me.

But when I was speaking with my boss about this opportunity, he mentioned that he was sure he was not mistaking me for another person. Because he double checks and observes carefully before he praises anyone for their hard work. 

But because he mentioned this, I felt doubtful because it meant that someone questioned his choice to praise me and offer opportunities. 

I later found out that my friend told me that another woman was wondering if our boss mistook me for her.  He is great with faces but not names. 

While I am incredibly excited to be acknowledged and recognized for all of the work I put in, I am scared to rise higher. Because the higher you rise, the more people will resent you for your achievements. And I am also afraid of the question “what if he made a mistake?”

41,"I've gone my whole life without doing much complaining at all, so I feel as though I can perhaps take a few minutes to let some stuff out. I was never close with my parents. They both died six years ago. I came home from school to find my mom in her bed and my dad on the floor a few feet away. There were needles, empty plastic baggies, and a charred metal spoon with an almost black cotton ball sitting next to it. They overdosed, but at least they were together, I guess. After that, I moved in with my grandmother. She needed the extra help, and I didn't have any other family, so it was mutually beneficial. She fell and hurt herself pretty bad about a week ago. The doctors gave a grim prognosis, and she passed away in the hospital earlier this morning. On Christmas f***ing Eve. I had hoped she would at least make it til New Years so we could have one last holiday season together, but I guess that ""fate"" had other plans for her. I've been taking unpaid leave from my part-time job and skipping college classes this past week to spend what little remaining time she had tending to her every want and need, which wasn't difficult since she wasn't even conscious most of the time. Yesterday, I took to a busy intersection here in New Orleans to beg strangers for money, since I haven't been working and I'm your stereotypical broke college student who puts every dollar towards repaying my student loans (or what's left after buying food and toilet paper). I haven't got a dime to my name, but at least I'm not homeless yet, so there's that. Food has taken priority over everything else, such as going to class or paying bills (especially medical bills at this point). I don't have any family left. I'm very introverted, so I don't have any friends, either. I'd give anything for one of either right now - that and enough food to last me until my next paycheck next Friday. How long can a human survive without food? How illegal is it to steal water for drinking from your neighbor's garden hose at night while they're sleeping? What's the best thing to write on a cardboard sign to get people to give you some spare change? Three things I never thought I'd ever have a reason to type into a Google search bar. Yet here I am - for now, at least. I haven't completely given up, but I think I'm getting close. I've only ever smoked weed a couple of times back in highschool, but when my parents died, did they feel any pain? How easy would it be for me to follow in their footsteps? Would I just drift off into a blissful sleep? Would someone find me and revive me? What if I wrote ""Do Not Resuscitate"" on a piece of paper and taped it to my chest? These are just thoughts, I'm not going to take the easy way out despite how so very appealing it seems right now, although starving to death would probably suck very much. I'm sorry for subjecting any unfortunate souls to my whining and complaining, but for the very first time in my life, I'm in a terrible situation to which I can think of no viable solution. My pride, my dignity, my courage, they're just illusions I used to think I had, but now, I'm nothing, I'm empty, and I'm terrified. Thanks for reading. I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas, but this year, I'm all out of holiday cheer. Happy holidays, and please wish me luck. I'm going to need it.",25Dec2019,1

Looking back at our conversations, I spotted many red flags of him expressing himself in an entitled and selfish way and wonder why I didn't catch it before. Makes me wonder whether we forgive alot of actions of friends just to remain agreeable, which sets us up for failure when we meet a disagreement.
All in all 1.5 years of friendship down the drain because this person could not accept differing opinions. He isn't a terrible person, and I definitely wish him well but such a shame in a world where people you connect with are hard to come by already.

48,"I’ve been living with my boyfriends family since early November. It’s definitely not the ideal situation, seeing as we sleep on a futon mattress on the floor of their freezing garage. It’s temporary, until we can get our own place. The night we spoke to his uncle about me moving in he said “I see no problem with people working to get their life together”. It was really a blessing because when I was facing homelessness my own mother wouldn’t let me stay with them. We both help where we can &amp; it’s been pretty smooth. 
Fast forward to about an hour ago. I’m at my parents house so I can wake up with my little sister on Christmas. I’m just about to go to sleep when my boyfriend calls me. Long story short, he goes downstairs &amp; our bed is gone. When he questions his uncle about it he doesn’t know about it, then when he asked a second time he told him that if the bed wasn’t there then maybe that was a sign he shouldn’t be sleeping there. He threw it out. Wtf ? 
When I left today my boyfriend was working on his car. He’s sleeping on the couch in the garage tonight then finishing his car &amp; leaving. He doesn’t know where he’s going. He asked me to talk to my parents about me staying here for a couple days, and my mother said that was fine. My dad said he would talk to her &amp; try to get that extended to however long is necessary. But if she doesn’t ? Wtf am I supposed to do ? I don’t have anyone left. I don’t even have anyone to tell this to besides my parents, so this is just me venting. I’m scared. I’m scared for my boyfriend most of all, because even if I can stay at my parents for now he’s still going to be living on the streets. 
I just don’t understand how you can do that to someone- your own family. If there was a problem with us staying there it could have been addressed instead of him going downstairs to find his bed gone. On fucking Christmas of all days. Now we’re both sol with no warning &amp; idek where to begin. Can I please catch a fucking break ? That’s all I’m asking man.",25Dec2019,1

Then I come home for the first time in six months, I’m really excited.

51,"I’m 27 and just kind of realized a lot of how. I lived and believed may not have been correct. Right now I’m realizing I was really sexually repressed and regret it a lot looking back, either not knowing how to handle sexual situations or attention or completely shutting myself off from living and opportunities throughout my prime years.  

A few years ago after a lifetime of incidences and traumatic experiences I decided to power thru and try to achieve my goals so I could gain independence from what I now allow myself to admit was a very abusive controlling family. I was doing well but had clashes with them and they used a creepy therapist I had fired against me to have me taken against my will many times even tried to file conservatorship over me, to which social workers told me that was seriously messed up and reserved for vegetables. 

My goals and plans and deadlines were ruined and I’ve just been left reeling in the aftermath. I had plans and vowed to live my life well before turning 25, but since then I’ve been homeless discarded and my plans were disrupted and my belongings were held hostage by my parents. I’ve come thru a lot of abuse I was never allowed to talk about or acknowledge so the wrong ppl would view me as wrong and bad or scary when I was trained to not emote myself the way I felt. 

I was fit and even that was taken when I went homeless I got emaciated and had to go to the ER a lot, took me 3 years to gain weight back. I don’t know what to do anymore I wanna die but u know how that goes. I’m mad because even like sexually I was totally isolating myself and now I realized oh I had something going on. I used to be so ashamed of my looks because of how my family treated me and talked to me and about me so much so that I would feel and act ugly to an amazing significant other who I realize now after I hurt him that he worshipped me.

I had therapist and fam telling me he was bad and abusive and lying and invalidating everything I was happy about from him. I hurt him bad and my family is the only ones reaping the benefit. I fucked a lot of losers I don’t like at all but even then I’ve gone about it all wrong and did it out of anger or hate. I was overcompensating for being so prude. I never masturbated until 24 when my creepy therapist told me to. My mom used to stand outside my door when I was 14 when I woke up in the morning. It was cold so I always put my hand in the front of my shorts and just kind of slept there but mom would always barge in and accuse me and make me feel shameful of something u wasn’t doing or intending.

I was so nubile and didn’t even realize I could work it, I was totally clueless and retarded in the world so I isolated. Now I’m realizing I could’ve had more fun and maybe even developed more of myself had I not lived that way. I can’t even start a porn career at my age now. If I had not been so scared and repressed at 18 I imagine I could’ve had a much more exciting or lived up life",25Dec2019,1

54,"Recently I've realized that my thoughts of suicide are always accompanied by a feeling of excitement, not sadness or other negative emotions. I'll go ahead and let you know there's no chance of me committing suicide, it's just not something I'd even do, but my brain often hands me the unblockable thought of ending this boring existence manually, and the only emotion I ever feel when thinking about suicide is excitement. It's the same excitement you feel when you fire your first missile launcher at a fake target. Nothing but adrenaline and thoughts of what could be. Pure happiness. I know if I ended it today I wouldn't care and I wouldn't be around to care about whoever did care. 

That being said, I also can't understand what causes people to actually commit suicide. Any time I get very deep in the suicide thought train, it just hits me that those are stupid ideas and I don't even really take them seriously. But then I think about all the people who actually do it every year and it makes me wonder what it would take to make me just a little to comfortable with the idea.

Anyways, whenever I have suicidal thoughts, it's a positive emotion I'm feeling, not negative. I don't get it. I know the negative things associated with suicide, I know the problems for others it can cause, yet thinking about it just makes me feel so okay and comfortable.

63,"When I was about 10 years old, my dad and I had volunteered to help with a local program to give presents to less fortunate children. How it worked was the school system gave us the names and addresses of every student that was on the free and reduced cost lunch program, as well as any other students who's families were otherwise considered to be low income (the school providing us this information was VERY illegal and they eventually got in trouble for it).

The donated toys were dropped off and sorted for gender and age range. My dad and I were wrappers. We sat for a couple hours at a time a few nights a week wrapping innumerable presents. Some of the toys had been donated by corporations, so there were some toys that we had dozens of. One such toy was a chemistry set. Every time I wrapped one, I made the comment about how cool it looked, and how lucky the recipient would be to get it.

The next part of the program was amazing. Volunteers decorated trailers to look like Santa's sleigh, complete with Christmas lights and reindeer cutouts. Santa would ride in the back of the trailer and go visit the children on Christmas Eve to hand deliver a present. That sounded like so much fun, but I wasn't allowed to participate in that part since I was so young.

On Christmas Eve, I was at home with my parents and watching whatever Christmas movie was on TV. Late in the evening as I was about to go to bed, there was a knock at the door. I found it odd that someone would come to visit this late, especially since we lived out in the middle of nowhere. I went to the door and was greeted by Santa! He had a gift for me. I opened it and it was the chemistry set I had been fawning over. I obviously knew it was one of the volunteers (I had seen him in the Santa costume before). He said that they had a few more toys donated than children, and the organization wanted to do a little something for me for volunteering so many hours. I'll never forget that night.

A couple of days before Christmas, I bought a bottle of vodka. Mixed a quarter of it with soda. I took all the pills I had in my apartment and swallowed them.. I sealed all the vents in my bathroom and made sure there were no open gaps in my bathroom. I then lit up a charcoal grill inside of my bathroom and went to sleep, hoping to die of carbon monoxide poisoning.

During the night, I woke up a few times with weird hallucinations, spasms and cramps. But I didn’t die. The next morning, it was as if the day before never happened. But everytime I tried to stand up for more than 5 seconds, I would pass out and fall to the floor... so I had to stay in bed all day. I was supposed to go to my parents that day. But how do you explain to them that you keep fainting because you tried to kill your self the day before? So I just told them it was the flu.

The day after, it was Christmas Day. I felt a little bit better, but still wanted to die. I tried to kill my self by hanging, but it didn’t work. I guess everytime I tried, my reflects kicked in and saved me. I then gave up and went to my parents to celebrate Christmas.

It’s been a couple of days since the attempt with carbon monoxide poisoning. I feel better overall, but I still experience hallucinations and weird lights sometimes. I still worry about fainting.

79,"Someone asked me how I know the difference between intuition and what I “just want.” My intuition is pretty strong, so as I have gotten older they are nearly one in the same. There is a distinction, though, between what I may find appealing either objectively or out of habit vs. what I truly want. More times than not, I want to do the right thing. But on the flip side I may vividly see the appeal or the expectation or the more comfortable paths which may win out, but then I feel in my bones that it’s not the same thing as what I truly want and know is right. When zone was younger I entered relationships and jobs because of listening to the appeal, even though it felt uneasy to me. Not so much anymore. 

Case in point- I stayed home this year instead of going to see my family because I’m on the end of a bad flu. I almost convinced myself that I’m no longer contagious, it would be really fun to be with them, I could sleep on the bus, it’s not morally right to stay home when I could just go, and other considerations, but in the end I really just wanted to stay home and get more rest, plus not put the kids’ health at risk before their first trip to Disney land.

Getting over language barriers was so much fun (thank you English for being a global language), getting to know a different culture was intriguing, and as a usually not very outgoing person, she helped me so much by dragging me out to local parties and such.

103,"For a time I became completely negative and I was miserable. Or was I? I think I began to see no point in it so I quit. Quitting was difficult I think. I don't remember things well. I like to think all my efforts to grow as a human being combined with an antidepressant allowed me to finally become the positive person I am today. I think however that my efforts could work for others without medication that is not as seriously mentally ill as I. It can't be just the medication because I still suffer horribly with negativity attempting to rule me. I used to share in my AA meeting that I go to that changing your mind is hard at first. That it's like rolling a boulder up a hill but after you get it to the top it becomes easy because you've become strong and now it just rolls away down the other side away from you. That doesn't seem to fit in what I know now. Now I've been in therapy for about ten years and been doing a lot of talking and trying to learn cognitive behavioral therapy. It's basically looking on the bright side of things from what I've gathered. Funny thing though. I seem to remember having to allow myself to do so. I used to think that life was a veil of tears but now I see it as something more. Something magical and mysterious. Parts of my analogy still fits. Negativity is like a boulder that had become damn near immovable for me. Something happened over the course of I have no idea how many years. I changed. I became someone that is good at fighting negativity. Now, I do have a serious mental illness and maladjustment to life. Those things are constantly bombarding me with reasons to be negative. But I fight to understand the why behind the issue. One of the things I do is I use a tool I learned here and a tool I learned there until it passes. Like my friend said. You just have to do something about the thing when it crops up. He seemed to also say that there is no real solving of the problem. I may not be remembering that correctly. I do think you can get so good at using tools that the time frame between when the negativity starts and ends grows shorter and shorter. So, there's a boulder of negativity sitting on your chest. You are capable of moving and acquiring tools to use to begin to chisel away at the boulder on your chest. Over time you will acquire more tools. At first, it seems no of no use but you have no choice. People tell you they work. Your life sucks. You use the tools. Then all at once the boulder seems gone but you try a new thing a new task a new relationship and the boulder comes back. So, you use your tools while suffering under the weight of the boulder. Over and over again you encounter a situation the boulder returns you use your tools under duress again and again. Then, one day, you encounter a situation that used to cause you duress but suddenly and unexpectedly you notice that there is no pain. There is no boulder. There is no working under duress to remove it. It's just no longer there because you have either become accustomed to the situation or you have gotten so good at using your tools that you use them instinctively now? Is this tool acquisition simply security blankets that allow you to face your fear? Is my analogy all wrong? Is it tools tat give you comfort while you fight? Are the tools a trick? A way to convince yourself that you will be alright facing your fear? Who knows. I'm more confused than ever.",25Dec2019,1

This seemed to pique her interest. So I went on about their habits and parenting skills. I mentioned how the mothers are the typically the first to migrate, then the chicks, then the fathers. The fathers will actually stay the latest, up to a week or more after the last chick migrates, to ensure that any boomerang chicks returning to the nest are taken care of.

I feel like I owe a final update to the wonderful people that replied and messaged me following the original submission. I had originally updated with another updated in which I had included the chats between us, but after a few hours I felt that its better to post a simple update than post entire chat threads.

Long story short, we are not in contact any more. Few days after I came back home, we tried to keep the chat normal, but she was acting erratically. I tried my very best to make this work, but it was clear that it was starting to be one sided. I wanted to go visit her again in December but she shut that down and was angry with me because ""it was easy for me to try hard"". 

To be honest, I was hurt by that statement, I tried to overlook it but I couldn't. When I calmly (and specifically told her I'm not angry with her) that I would like to speak with her over a call, she didn't talk with me for over a week. (Later that day, I saw she posted on facebook one of those ""Share to win"" destinations. It was for Malta. )

 After a week, she came to tell me she was moving to Germany. She started giving me shit about something, I stood up to her and basically after a while the conversation fizzled out. She didn't even wish me happy birthday, 3 days later.

It is clear that she has some personal issues and maybe does not know how to communicate. I would have loved to help her in all the ways, but she didn't let me in. The shared ""Win a trip to Malta"" made me think like she is a prisoner of herself, like she is locked inside her, wants to get out but does not how. I am honestly sorry for her. She is really a beautiful lady, inside out.

Why am I posting this here, today? Being Christmas and knowing she is alone in Germany, I decided to send her a simple message, sort of a closure (even though I moved on back in November). I sent her ""Happy Christmas. You will always be in my heart"". She replied with a simple ""Thank you"".

So this is the update I think you people deserve to know. Thank you for reading and for your messages. I do not regret this experience one bit, and I would do it again in a heartbeat. To be cliche', I prefer to try and fail than wonder for eternity ""what could have been"".

Every time I goto her house, it's a god damn mess. Her husband is a lazy dumbass who thinks ""I just got home from work, I'm going to have my wife do dinner, take care of the kids, bathe them and put them to bed as I watch sports and star wars."" I wish I was joking. How does 1 person have enough clothes to fill 1/2 the kid's section at walmart? EXPLAIN THAT TO ME? Does she donate? No she just collects, she then throws them in her room and never gets them out. There's a literal 3 ft mountain in her room of clothes that span at least 5 ft outwards. Her dishes, CONSTANTLY a pile. I don't mean like 6 or 7 dishes, I mean there's like piles all over the place. Oh 3 kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her husband oh man:

Oh man, let me tell you about this worthless man. Come to find out, this man was coddled really early by his mom. His mom comes over and hands an ENTIRE box of M&amp;Ms to her little autistic grandchild and thinks it's ok. He's barely 4. Yes, did I mention he's AUTISTIC? He is in DENIAL about his child being autistic. He was in sped too (I was but I'm not autistic but there are other reasons). He is so afraid that he will be treated differently and made fun of. Not in this decade.   


He makes excuses for his child's behavior. Acts like it's ok. Acts like there's nothing wrong with him. The kid runs around in either a diaper or naked. He can barely speak a single sentence and grunts about everything. He gets angry at colours. He gets upset if anything touches his head. He HATES bath time, I don't mean he pitches a little fit and gets over it, I mean this kid goes off the rails. I was in SPED my entire life, sure, I may not be mentally where I should be hell, I can tell this kid is something else. 

This man comes home, doesn't do shit. All he does is sit on the couch, drinks coke and watch sports or something else. He doesn't clean, he doesn't cook, nothing. My sister asked him to put the kids to bed, feed them, bathe them, put them to sleep. he literally whined to her ""but I'm tired."" Mother fucker. These are YOUR children, sure the 10-year-old isn't yours but that's beside the fuckin point. At least get him in line.   


Oh, but the minute that my 10 y/o nephew steps a toe out of line he loses his shit on him. I noticed this is a step kid/parent thing.  

Come to find out, his mom didn't even want a 2nd grandchild (like it's any of her concern), and when my little cutie niece was born, she neglected her for almost the first year and 1/2 for no reason. This came from my sister. She still treats her badly for no reason. She loves seeing me, so does my eldest nephew. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my nieces and nephews:  


I have 3 from my sister. one 2 1/2 y/o one 4 y/o and one 10 y/o.   


The 10 - y/o - He doesn't know how to clean. He has no sense of responsibility, but then again, what 10 y/o does? He sleeps with his mom because his room is a fuckin mess. He never cleans it and my sister doesn't make him, and there's a smelly turtle in there. Not his, it's his stepdads...

&amp;#x200B;

The 4 1/2 y/o - As I said, he's the littlest brother, the middle child. My bro-in-law, he acts like it's completely ok to let him run around and cause problems. My dad lost it one day because the little brat was carrying my sister's chrome book. My dad said ""Put it down"" and he just dropped it on the ground. The kid didn't put it down easily he threw it on the ground. The kid is autistic. He can't function without some supervision. He throws fits, he gets upset, throws things around the place. Thinking it's ok. My bro-in-law? He just ""calms him down."" He can't even be in DAYCARE because they tried and he was actually asked to leave because of his extreme behavior.   


My niece:  
She's a little drama princess who needs mommies attention nonstop. No one loves this little girl :(. Bullshit, my sister gives her attention every second she can. She's become a little smart ass mostly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her house. Let me tell you:  
Walk-in, there are shoes on the floor all over the place. Like 10 pairs. The walls are all marked up. The couch is a bit fucky. Toys everywhere. Kitchen table constantly a mess. The sink is filled up with dishes. So many that it would take you almost an hour and 1/2 to clean up. Let's go down the hall, walls marked up, bathroom, it's ok, but there's books, clothing, the bathtub has toys in.   


My nephew's bedroom:  
It is filled with toys that he never plays with, a turtle that belongs to my bro-in-law, random game cases to games he likely doesn't know exist. A laptop with an external keyboard and mouse, that he barely uses. A perfectly good bunk bed that he doesn't use. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next room is my little niece and nephew:  
They don't clean it, the children don't sleep in there, again, all the kids and my sister and bro-in-law sleep int he same bed. WHY? My father is going to live there because he had to sell the house and he can't do anything about it do to his current health condition. Now that he had a stroke, he doesn't have a choice. 

That room is a fuckin mess. There's so many toys that are old or never used or opened. My dad is fed up with it too.   


MY SISTERS ROOM:  
As I said at the start of this, there's a TV on the wall, a dresser covered in clothes, random crap, and who knows what else. Their bed, till they goto sleep is covered in clothing. The piles and piles of clothing is a fuckin 3 ft by 5 ft mountain. Their bathroom isn't even accessible due to the amount of clothing and it leads TO the bathroom. Most of her room is just a pile of everyone's clothing. She never gets to it.   


I am so sad to see my sister live like this. I don't know how she does or wants to. I asked my dad and her mom (same dad different mom) about this. Both of them said the same thing ""we don't know how it got this bad.""

128,"I am stupid. I am lazy. I have poor social skills. I am unlikable. I don't fit in anywhere, not even with nerds, gamers or outcasts. I am a virgin who has never had a girlfriend or any cool ""coming of age"" experiences. I have 2 friends and I haven't made a friend since I was 18. I have no job. I have no education. I have no hobbies. I'm not good at a single thing. 

I've been completely numb and depersonalized these past 6 months (worse than ever), in part because I'm fully realizing the life I have created for myself. I've never been really happy since I was 17, since then I've been socially withdrawn, depressed and had daily thoughts of suicide but I figured that was pretty normal for an adolescent. However recently I've been strongly considering suicide (Making plans and working on the note) because the pain (and shame) is just too much.

Theres only one problem: I love my mom and don't want to break her heart. She's been through so much (we lost 4 close family members this year to fentanyl, another to drunk driving, and her dad to lung cancer. Needless to say Christmas family dinner was pretty sparse this year) So I've decided I will drag on, no matter how much pain I am in, as long as my mom is alive I will not do it. I have no other reason to live (never really have).

Is there anything I can do in the mean time until my mom passes? I am not smart enough to get educated, what is a good job for people who are lazy and uneducated and not good with people? Should I just move in with my mom and just take care of her instead? Also is it possible to get a girlfriend when you have nothing to offer? Okay I already know the answer to that, but it would be nice to experience that before I die. Is it possible to start from scratch and fix some of my problems? That would be nice but I'm skeptical, for instance I kinda feel like if you don't have a social life by the time you're like 20, it's impossible to get one.

Thanks for reading.",25Dec2019,1

I'm an academically struggling college student. The only requirement left in order to graduate is to pass my philosophy thesis class and defend my thesis. I dropped the thesis class on my first take in order to focus on researching and writing my thesis, along with fulfilling the requirements of my other philosophy subjects. 2nd attempt was fruitful but i still wasn't good enough. I don't want to say that i'm depressed because i'm not clinically depressed, but the sadness that i'm constantly feeling due to failing to graduate on time is quite similar to depression. I spent this year trying to finish my thesis. I can't stop comparing myself to my peers who have already graduated and are working, already pursuing their careers and actually advancing in their lives.

139,"Hey!  

So I figured why not write my life story to here and converse about my feelings on the internet, here goes!  

So currently I’m 25 years old. I had particularly bad adolescence which effected my thoughts and feelings. And generally I’m extremely frustrated with myself. Let’s rewind and visit some major points in my life and how they affected me. 

So, I was born in a culturally European part of a Muslim country. Both of my parents are educators so I was raised well in terms of education. Also, I don’t have any bad memories of my childhood. But there are some bad things that probably happened that I can't remember. Let me paint the picture:

My parents had no friends and they were generally reserved people.  My father was a extremely depressed and alcoholic physics teacher and my mother was a delusionally happy maths teacher. My father used to retreat to my parents room and work for the topics of physics. He was a perfectionist I guess. Leftie guy in uni so he always had problems with school. Finished 4-5 years late as far as my mom told me. And my mom was working extremely hard, always had students come to our house in order to take lessons from her.  

In good part of my childhood, I was locked away to my room because mom has a student with her and dad was working on physics. I wasn’t physically alone tho, I was with my narcissistic brother which is two years older than me. He always manipulated me and did all the fun stuff himself. For example, we had a PlayStation 1 and he always played with it. I remember playing for 20 minutes and him yanking the controller from my hand because “I was playing bad”. I wish I had the maturity to tell him at that time “hey buddy, i’m playing bad because while you play 4 to 5 hours a day, i can only do that for 20 mins and then i have to sit here and watch you, how can I play as good as you?” alas, it wasn’t possible.  

Anyways, so what you can get from that is you can define my parents as negligent, even though both my brother and I were good in terms of education. I managed to get full scholarship from a prestigious primary school in 5th grade. Before that, I was studying at a public school. Anyways, that’s when things started to turn sour. 

I always heard that I was naturally “gifted”, “bright” and “smart”. My parents never acknowledged studying as a big part of my achievement, because me being “smart” was a proof of their smartness I guess. Whatever. Nothing happened as far as I can remember in sixth grade. In 7th grade, I became extremely close friends with this guy, who was rich as fuck and didn’t have my -my familiy's- concerns. And I liked that. We built a sizable community around with people who couldn’t care less about their education because they were rich. I wasn’t though. 

Because the way I was raised, I always tried to protect my friends. I always cared for others, and always knew the importance of community. This, of course, meant that I became a problem child who had somewhat of a critical thinking in terms of general authority structures in primary school. I started to go to discipline almost every week. We formed a group with knifes and shit, graffitied the school property, beat up little kids, bullied people. Whatever right? We were kids. We were punk, before knowing what the fuck a punk is. I got beaten up, get insulted by my teachers all the time. I always questioned their methods of teaching, behavior, knowledge, etc.  

Then it happened, as my final act in 8th grade, I had enough with the authority. Facebook was becoming increasingly popular at this time, so I started a group. It had a manifesto and everything and I wrote about how the behavior of discipline committee is wrong, etc. But with that, I also made the mistake of insulting all of the school, calling it a brothel with stupid rules that we won’t follow. In retrospect, it was one of my first attempts in collective anarchism. Because I was just starting to get interested in leftist politics at that time.

Anyways, after the group had like 100-150 people, some teacher found out about it. She printed all my insults, the fact that parents were following the group, etc. Being a private school, this put extreme pressure to higher ups of school so they punished me. My cruel punishment was that I wasn’t allowed to participate in any class, and they put me in this glass room where everyone would see me and look at me. They didn't kick me out of school mind you. I was basically a prisoner. I couldn’t go back to my classroom, I wasn’t even allowed to be near 6th, 7th and 8th graders. That fucking sucked. I also had a girlfriend at the time and her mother constantly berated her with the fact that I was a bad boi for her. So we broke up at the glass room. It happens, right?  

Then I prepared myself for the exam and went to high school. The high school was public, so at this point I’m not prepared to the “general public” at all.

First thing I tried to do was to remove the unproductive thoughts from my life. I was ready to conform this time. But it never happened. Also, as the age allows, people started to question the things that I was questioning all the way from 4th grade. I wasn’t saying this as “I was smarter”, maybe my father was because he introduced me to these ideas. Anyways, therefore I adopted this mission of educating my fellow students through the knowledge and critical thinking I accumulated over the years. I became the “argument guy” in high school. This motivated me to search deep within the knowledge and arguments against popular beliefs. But the more I searched for knowledge and became good at arguing, I started to argue with myself harder. I remember always questioning every thing that I have read, populating arguments against it, defeating them with newly found knowledge, and going all over again. In terms of education this might be one of the good things that I’ve done. But this also meant that I slowly started to not get along with my peers. I wasn't enjoying their company anymore. It only makes sense right? 

Anyways, while these were happening, I couldn’t drop the problem child act. I started smoking in 8th grade, and in high school smoking was banned. With my intrinsic need to question authority, this became a big problem for me. I started to actively work against what my teachers told me. That created lots of problems. Almost every week I was in deputy manager’s office. Not a single teacher liked me apart from a biology teacher who never  taught my class. That’s telling I guess. 

I formed a group here as well. We were protesting student representative elections, we were escaping the school for no reason, hanging out in canteen at class hours, arguing with teachers for no reason other than making us feel better about ourselves and logical conclusions that we came to. I mean, I did these things. I’m imagining they did as well. They were younger then me so I wouldn’t know if they lived the ideals of it as much as I did. This was basically me in high school.

Anyways, I had a long distance girlfriend starting from the summer of 9th grade (2009). We were in different cities and always had love for each other. She liked me very much for some reason. I wasn’t that into it but as far as she was willing to come to my city and be chill about us being apart I was okay with it. But as time went she went incredibly dependent on me. Which I was not okay with. Tried to end the relationship 5-6 times in high school but for some reason I just couldn't. She always accepted me back when I tried to connect with her again when I felt lonely. But for some reason, I always felt like I didn’t really \*love\* her. I knew the relationship is therefore dishonest but never actually talked to her about my feelings as honest as I'm writing here. I think the comfort of having a girlfriend for my entire high school life comforted me for some reason. But it always left a sour taste in my mouth. I was becoming increasingly depressed about our relationship. And things slowly started to worsen everyday. Will come back to this later.  

At the final grade while I was studying to university acceptance exam, things went south. My parents got divorced. Throughout my high school life, my parents were starting to fell apart. They started a business together, which, evidently, was a bad idea. Anyways, you can imagine the effects this had over my mental situation. I was actually relieved when they said that they were gonna divorce because they were often arguing when they were together. 

My brother picked up gaming to the extreme degree while these were happening. While I was in 10th grade, I remember my mother crying and yelling at him angrily almost once a week because of his addiction. He didn’t care. He fought my father almost always. They weren’t talking at all when my parents announced the plans to divorce if I remember correctly. Even when they were announcing their divorce, he wasn't in the room. I haven't heard from my father ever since leaving that room too. I know he's alive. But he wouldn't talk to me. Why?

Therefore, the burden of the break up fell to my shoulders. In 12th grade, I went to court, gave my witness statement, etc. I was preparing for exam while dealing with this shit. I couldn’t hang out with my friends at this point either because constant barrage of my girlfriend’s toxic jealous restrictions had a toll on me. It got to a point where I had to close my phone just so I can go to a bar in order to celebrate a friend's birthday. Guess what she did? Went in to my facebook, messaged all my friends and get a hold of my friend’s phone in order to talk with me. She was crying out of her fucking mind when my friend gave the phone to me. I think this would summarize the general behavior of her towards me when we are away from each other.

So, to summarize, at this point in my life I was having problems with my school, my gf, my friends, my family.  

The depression of all of these came and hit me like a train. I was becoming more and more depressed every day. I cut my communication with my then gf, stopped studying for university and would just open a book and space out. Everyday, I would solve ten question of maths and start to disassociate. Every. Single. Day.  

Then I figured changing cities and going to another city in order to study would be the best course of action. So, I did exactly that. With disregarding the fact that my gf would come to my city in order to live with me.  

I dodged that shit and went to a different city. I said, again, that we should break up. She didn’t accept, again. Which made me feel worse about the situation. I could’ve just fucking cut communications completely but I was already feeling like a fucking trash about it so I figured if I continue communicating with here while I was in different city, eventually she would like to end the relationship as well. It’s the uni we are talking about here, eventually she could find another guy. Right? Fucking wrong. 

Anyways, when I started the university in another city, I felt like a fucking alien. I couldn’t even understand half the shit they were saying, their values and general thoughts about life became increasingly weird to me. After finishing the first year early (in 1 term instead of 2), I just sat at home in a different city alone and played games that I don’t really like that much. My mental situation became worse. I was living in a full blown depression at this point. I remember not leaving my bed for weeks. I always ordered food, so I didn’t even leave the house for 4 months. Just sitting there by myself, browsing internet, talking with no one but myself and some gaming friends and my gf, that’s it. At the second year, I talked with no one. Like literally, not a single fucking soul from my faculty. I isolated myself from everyone because I had enough with everyone’s shit. Bad decision. After some serious consideration, I started to become friends with people. That made the school at least bearable. But guess what happened then? I got an F for not participating in physics labs even though they assured me that because I was irregular I don’t have to actually go to the lab and just solve the tests. After I went to my teachers office for discussing it with a proof of my counselor's email, he just looked at me blank and said “yeah, i can’t do nothing about it at this point”. The irritation that I felt when I realized that I have to take a phys-102 class again because of their fucking mistake. I can’t fucking begin to describe you, especially after all that I lived regarding education. My situation became worse.  

When I became increasingly suicidal at some point, I figured I have to go back. I have to go back to the agony that I call home. I have to go back to all that fighting, crying, sleepless nights. On top of it all, my gf that I don’t really love that much was there as well. Oh well. I figured why the fuck not?  

So at this point i’m two years into the education. I decided to go back. Which meant I had to drop everything I did in two years and start all over again in a private university. Same major as well. Computer Engineering. 

Dude, I can’t begin to tell you the boredom I felt every day going to that school. At first hanging out with my gf was cool because that meant I don’t have to spend time with my now broken family. But that didn’t last as well.  

Anyways, somehow I survived the two repeat years. At last, I was picking up where I left and things will become better eventually right? No. 

It became increasingly worse. I stopped enjoying anything at all. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn't play games. I couldn't listen to music. I couldn’t love. I couldn’t do anything at all. I felt empty, all the time. Our economical situation worsened by the way. So I had that issue added to my plate as well. My brother had gave up on living at this point. I kid you not, he wasn’t even going to bathroom in order to pee. His room was worse than a stereotypical crack house. My gf had an almost diagnosis with problems of her brain as well (imagine living with a diagnosis called ""maybe epilepsy""), which increased her anxiety to the point where I could fucking sense it while lying in bed next to her. I couldn’t sleep next to her as well because I snored. I remember begging her to go home and sleep, but she insisted for me to stay. I was a fucking trash at this point so whatever she says I would do. She’s the only human being that I was comfortable talking with anyways. That was a fucking mistake because she became more and more attached to me. I couldn’t have a single fucking weekend to myself or any of my friends. I have to almost always go to her place, fuck and watch series while eating pizza. It may sound like a good life, but after repeating this for 2 years it became the worst thing I have done in my whole life. It was boring me to the uncomfortable levels. Believe me. 

So at the third year, it became worse. I didn’t want to do it. She - hopefully unintentionally - forced me. I agreed. Because I was a human garbage anyways right? Who cares about my fucking feelings? Certainly not her because she had enough of my “complaints”.  

I abided.  

At some point, I couldn’t tho. Like, I couldn’t in a physical sense. I always wanted to yoink her to the ground when we were having sex. It became increasingly irritating. To the point when my dick stopped working. Imagine adding erectile dysfunction to this mess at 22 year old. Oh what you said? Is it normal if I feel this way that I might not want to have sex? That’s fucking crazy talk to my 22 year old ears buddy. I always thought that I have became asexual, if that is even possible. So that was it, I wasn't enjoying the last thing I enjoy doing in this life.

My only way out was certain, killing myself. I don’t have the strength to break up with her anyways. I emotionally lived breaking up 6 times at this point, I couldn’t handle one more. When I caught myself actually planing for suicide and gathering the items necessary to do it, I understood that I need help.  

Lucky for me, my gf went to USA for work and travel so I had the time to work on myself for the first time in years. I went to therapy and increasingly became better throughout the summer. She still fucked my life from other side of the ocean but whatever, I was getting better. I was taking care of myself for the first time. I was working out. I was eating healthy. To the point I build up enough strength to break up with her this time. When she came back from US, I tried again.  

Guess what happened when I tried? Dude she became fucking insane. I couldn’t believe the catharsis I saw before my eyes. She begged, cried, done all the things she could to break my determination. She threw herself to ground. Constantly yelling. And oh boy, it fucking worked. I simply couldn’t continue. She promised me that it would get better. 

It didn’t. 

But eventually she found the strength to break up with me. We damaged each other so much in this 9 year period that she finally realized the damage we have done to each other is catastrophic. I still had one year left in my second university. But it was gonna be okay.

I started to rebuild my life from scratch. Connected with old friends, downloaded dating apps, started to do things that I actually liked after 4-5 years of constant conformity. I wasn't talking to my brother for two years and I rebuilt our relationship. 

And, my dudes, I felt the freedom. Turns out, it was the freedom that I fought for from the beginning of my early education years. 

Things didn’t improve instantly tho. Living with early set clinical depression for 7-8 years , isolating myself from everyone, all the fucked up things that I said to myself over the years took a plunge to me.  

I still have certain defense mechanisms that made me survive my past, toxic life. I still lie without intending to do it. I still live my emotions in extremes. I still struggle with addiction. I still struggle understanding my family. I still struggle with the results of isolation. I still go to therapy. My grip with reality is not that solid because of all the daydreaming I have done over the years as an escape. I can't trust my emotions anymore. I can't trust my reasoning anymore. Also, I'm showing all the symptoms of bipolar type 2 but I'm too afraid to bring it up to my therapist. I'm probably exaggerating anyways. Right?

But I’m trying. And for the first time in my 25 years of life, I feel free. I feel unburdened. I feel like an actual being. I feel like I managed to do it. And I’m trying so fucking hard to be normal again. But seemingly no one acknowledges it. I actually am trying so hard. I'm trying to be open and honest about my feelings. I'm trying to be better to myself. I'm trying to love myself. I'm trying so fucking hard after all this. 

But no one really knows the whole picture. Because who would want to listen to a sob story of a guy? For how long? 

The entire time I wrote this, I constantly told myself ""who cares"" and ""bohoo so bad for you wow what a bad life"" and shit. That's how my mind works now. I think this life inherited that to me. Which I hate. I'm trying to better it. I'm trying to fight my superego every day. My mind is fucking rushing with anxiety most of the times that I numb my head with drugs or alcohol. I always try to justify myself. I always try to get a hold of my mind. I always over analyze every action that I made and every feeling that I have as a result of physiotherapy. I'm extremely confused about life, my truths and my thoughts. I hate this feeling but I acknowledge that with enough practice they will eventually stop being a problem. Hopefully guys. Hopefully I'll undo all of this. Hopefully I'll become the person that I'd become if I haven't lived this life. 

Am I the asshole? I don't know. But even if I was back then, I'm actively trying to better myself. I think that counts for something, right?",25Dec2019,1

I’m nearly 31 and the first kid to move out and the only kid to move out until my brother finally did it last year when he was 27. Every single one of my other siblings still live at home from 25 to 7 years old and three are adults. 

Growing up was fine and dandy until I became a teenager and it just became an abusive mess especially between my mom to the point I got acid reflux and my hair started falling out. We aren’t wealthy people nor are we poor by any means but that many kids (8 total when I left for college) will strain finances so I remember clearly my parents telling me I was to be out of there and if it wasn’t college it’d be the military since my ass wasn’t going to stay at home with them. Logically I didn’t question it because it made sense; we all had to share rooms with another sibling and I’ve never had my own room since I was a preschooler or so. It didn’t stop me from feeling upset that the minute I left, my sister (9) was moved and my brother (16) got that room. So when I came home for the breaks and the summer I lived out of a suitcase. 

The bitterness didn’t start until I noticed that things I didn’t get or was promised my brother and sister got. For example, I was ‘given’ a room makeover of a paint job since my room was baby shower pink. Never happened, but my sister (14) who also got her own room got it decked out with moulding, metallic paint and a custom closet for all her clothes. When my brother went to college, things like failing a class or even his Cs were just mild disappointment whereas on my end that shit was ‘fucking ass loser’ territory. 

There’s way too much to get into but essentially I had to cut myself out of all of that but visited and hung once I got my own place and job (I taught high school so I taught a few of my siblings).

Current:

I took a chance to get my Masters degree and to get out of teaching as I was in the middle of a tremendous burnout. My maternal grandfather died and my grandma wanted someone here with her. She did not want to move in with my uncle. I said no at first because of having both a job and home so she tried to court my brother (promised to get him a Vietnamese girlfriend) and then my sister until she railed on her for being shit. So I go and all I know is she and my mother were estranged. Given how she treated me growing up and as an adult at times, I gave her the benefit of the doubt. 

Which makes me a big fat idiot. However I feel bitter to the fact that why grandma is such an awful person wasn’t told to me by my mother. Even more so, I feel like the rest subject again when she brings up how relieved she didn’t let my sister go and get hurt whenever I bring up some shit I’m experiencing here. 

During this time too my brother finally got off his ass and got a job and moved. Before that, broke down the family car, got a DUI and a whole slew of bad partners yet was helped out of all that by the parents. I had to pay this same brother to help me move aka food, actual cash and his plane ticket home. Apparently this isn’t what families do because my friend just looked at me like I was about to finish off the joke, until I didn’t. 

Anyway I’m in Georgia and his Air Force graduation is in Texas. My mom, brother (17) and sister (24) bought tickets and hotel rooms to see him do this and sightsee afterwards. Even though he and the girlfriend treated them like an afterthought. In my entire stay here, I didn’t get any one offering to do that; I only got to see them that time because they had a small layover at Hartford. I even asked them to come down for an art show of mine but all of it was ignored even by friends so I cancelled it. I pretty much just slapped ‘no’ on all my graduation forms for attendance because frankly what’s the point? 

Between school and having my entire paycheck go for bills and food, I can’t afford to visit them over there. It’s all I wanted for this Christmas was to have the chance to visit for a holiday over there but here I am in Georgia still. Even worse is despite the Uncle and the grandparent, I’ve not been even considered for any holiday gathering. I couldn’t tell you if I only got to go the other time because grandma wanted a chauffeur or if I was actually invited by him. 

I do talk to my mom and another sister (20) a lot, hearing about how mom drives them to school even an hour away or to work or makes them steak and favorite things to eat. This year has been particularly hard and lonely due to a dear pet dying, a root canal, a violent drunkard friend of grandma’s and abusive shenanigans, so I’ve wanted things like a card or something. Like they gave my brother for weeks and weeks while he was at boot camp feeling the same. I’ve sent them gifts as I could afford them but if I was thinking a card back was too high of hopes, I didn’t even get an acknowledgement they ever got anything. I actually had to check on Etsy to make sure it was delivered. 

My mom is really the only one that helps; she gave me some money to cremate my pet since the vet bills were so high. I really don’t want to feel so awful but the holidays this year have really brought it out so badly that I pretty much try to sleep though it all so I can feel ok again and return to work. 

I’m not even sure I’m asking anything, just thank you for listening to what I needed to say, I really appreciate it.",25Dec2019,1
144,"I'm just a simple consumer trying to help a friend with partial immobility in a single limb - what's the best place as a 3rd party to start looking for the most recent (and purchasable) tech advancements or prosthetics out there to help my friend get the most out of life again?

She has lost all feeling and muscle control below one knee and wants to run and jump again but is basically feeling defeated about her current situation; amputees have better equipment for running and jumping than the assistive bracing she has to use.  Her current device provides a rigid backing for her calf and ankle and allows her to put pressure on the ball and heel of her foot to stand and walk but running and jumping is a bit of a shit show because there's no spring action.  

She doesn't know I'm researching this for her.  I'm just watching her struggle in our rec league and I just think to myself, man, there's GOTTA be something better out there for her.  She's an otherwise reasonable fit person and I know she busts her ass at PT so that's why I'm focused on the device as a solution here.",25Dec2019,1

Either because we didn’t want to use our leave, too expensive or just because so many people left and someone had to stay behind to run this place. Anyways, we’re in Hawaii so yeah it’s pretty far and costly to go to mainland. 

Well. Currently it’s Christmas and I’m dying from it being so hot In the barracks. I started thinking and well, only logical thinking is that they turned off the AC to the barracks because almost everyone left so I mean, we’re not human right? We don’t deserve AC because we don’t work for our paycheck right?

147,"The world we live in is fucked up, that’s clear. But it’s hard when you have to wake up everyday, and go and read the news which is describing the latest racial or sexist attack by our president, a person who is supposed to represent the whole country. It’s even worse to see so much of the country train behind him, fueled by hate.

It’s hard when you’re sick, and can’t go seek help because you can’t afford it, or you can’t afford the insurance, or the doctor you really need doesn’t take your insurance, and now you’re getting charged thousands of dollars for getting sick.

It’s hard when your rent is due, and you can’t afford the one bedroom apartment even though you work two jobs, because the rent goes up and the wages stay the same.

It’s hard when you’re told all your life to get an education, and then when you try, you get charged so much you would be a slave to the debt you racked up for years to come.

It’s hard, that when life makes you so unhappy you have to rely on substance to escape it, then you get caught, have your freedoms stripped, given a number and a uniform, and have to spend years working slave labor for a corporation. 

It’s hard living in this country, nearly every aspect of our lives either entails despair or is dealing with it. Every second I’m reminded of the world we live in, and the fact that the problems are so massive and widespread, I want to put a bullet in my brain. Better to die free than live as a slave, always working towards something, and never having enough.

I would say I’m sorry, but I’m the one who needs the apology, and so do each and every one of you, America has repeatedly screwed us, and gives us distractions so we can’t see the evil, it’s time they said sorry, and fixed their mistakes, so we can all live free.",25Dec2019,1

152,"I was supposed to go to a big family gathering tonight. I had all the ingredients ready to make my casserole this morning, and an awesome gift all wrapped and ready for the White Elephant exchange. Had my outfit picked out and transportation arranged. 

But I started to feel sick last night and woke up today with a sore throat, stuffy nose, muscle aches, etc. It's not too terrible, but I definitely don't feel like going out and spreading germs to twenty or thirty family members. 

So now I am spending the day by myself in my cozy apartment. Going to relax, watch Netflix, read, eat some of the copious amounts of delicious food I have in the fridge, and basically just have a great time alone.

Definitely not sad about this.

153,"One of my mother's brothers has been telling people that I don't suffer fools. This insight surprised me quite a bit as I didn't think anyone on that side of the fence paid any close attention. If you aren't aware of the saying or what it means, that's okay. It means that I don't have patience with foolishness and will not endure it like a gentleman. This can mean many things and can applied to a great number of situations. For me, it applies to those contexts where common sense is tossed out the window in favor of extreme stupidity.

Jerry, you know that I was researching various stocks and writing them down as a form of personal paper trading. One of the stocks that I was doing this with, a stock I would have invested in, skyrocketed. Had you invested in this particular stock like you did with that bullshit California power bankruptcy nonsense, you would not be having financial issues right now. You would not have to work nor worry about any bills. You could've paid off your student loans with cash and still lived a worry free life. Considering that it was the stock I selected based on my own research, I'm pretty fucking disappointed right now. 

For those of you intimately familiar with that bullshit situation, this is the type of mindless fucking stupidity that's thrown my way often. Treachery is not a characteristic of intelligence. It is not a byproduct of wisdom and proper thought. In all forms of media where it is demonstrated, it is the refuge of the coward. A home to those who cannot and will not no matter what. It's the grand scheme of the loser who thinks nothing of reputation or what others think of them. 

Come January 1, 2020, all of you will be removed from my life permanently. I'm tired of the fucking stupidity, inaction, inability, treachery, conspiracy, backstabbing, and all the other great qualities of people brought to life from sewage. 

Time and time again I have stepped up and presented offers of cooperation and team membership to go forward. In each and every situation, excuses were given that were not even rational. They were fucking silly. If it wasn't the lame excuses, it was the broken promises. Oh, man. How many of you thought you were going to prove me wrong by investigating my court transcripts? That you would reveal me as a liar? Were you surprised? I know they were checked because the silence on that particular topic is very enlightening. 

Each and every time any potential action was presented on the basis of forward progress, people resorted to the same tired ass James Bond 007 bullshit. Who are you people afraid of? The people that scatter and run for safety when action is finally taken? The ones who creep behind the back and talk quietly? Nobody fucking cares about all that which you perceive as embarrassing. 

Multiple wives? Nobody gives a flying fuck. The Iranian leadership reminded me of the limit. That's how far the concern went. A fuck-ton of children? Nobody has said a word about any of it because the Good Deeds that I do, outweigh the established concept of morality here in Neo-America. Police interference? They have finally realized that their street level informants are of a low quality and troublesome. They have asked how they can stay out of the way as to avoid wrath. The only people left are those trying to deceive others. That they are worry some and powerful. Comedy is what that is. 

You don't see any of this, but there are third parties who are asking that I make a decision as to what I'm going to do. Shit or get off the pot is more along the lines of what they are asking. But even they are being too secretive and this prevents any useful plan of action from being established. Too much stage fright here. 

So come January 1, I will make a decision. It will be permanently binding. I cannot continue to have people in my life who promote inaction and stale existence. Those of you waiting in the shadows will be pleased to know that we will become permanent. Your concerns become mine, and mine yours. All of us together and everyone else kept out. 

From the very beginning I explained what was happening, what would likely happen, and how I would respond. Even now some of you are seeing agitation and a form of panic. Why? Because I called a shot and it was extremely effective. 

I'm holding the door open because I had this belief these grievances would be temporary and resolved over time. It would seem this was incorrect and now I have to start shutting doors and moving on.",25Dec2019,1

155,"Christmases are celebrated on Christmas Eve in my house. My close neighbors come over, as well as my uncle and his wife and their 3 children. Two of the kids are damn near full adults, about my age. The youngest is an absolute nightmare of attitude, eye-rolling, and has a gift of being totally ungrateful for literally anything he opens under the tree. My neighbors’ young kids are always appreciative of what they get. They never complain or say they don’t like it, and they always say thank you regardless of its a box of tissues.

I’m saving up for an apartment and will be in the official process of moving out come February or March of 2020. I work full time and snagged 40 hours of overtime this holiday season to build up my savings enough to be financially secure. Needless to say, I don’t have the funds to just be spending money left and right. I’m a teenager trying to build her life; I’m not established in the way my mom is. 

Knowing damn well my uncle’s kids never appreciate anything given to them, I made the conscious decision to not give them anything this year, because last Christmas I gave them clothes and they just tossed it to the side and made a face. However, this year, I bought a few little dinky toys and clothes for my neighbors’ kids. Nothing big or expensive. Just something simple. At first, when it was almost Christmas and I’d not gotten my cousins anything, I felt a little bad. My mom was telling me that I HAD to get them something because they’re my family and it wouldn’t be right.

No. I’m not obligated to spend my hard-earned money on ANYBODY. And after witnessing the entitlement and ungratefulness last night, I am forever thankful that I stood my ground and did not give them a single gift. There was some whining and bitching over not getting a PS4, throwing clothes on the ground, making faces, and acting like little bitches. They could have gotten nothing. Which is exactly what they got from me. Nothing. I’m not sure if they realized I gave everyone else a gift but them, but it doesn’t matter. I saved myself money and the pain of watching them not appreciate their presents. Again. 

I wanted to feel bad. My mom was trying to make me feel like a monster for leaving them out—but at the end of the day, nobody is entitled to YOUR money, time, effort, and love. This might make me selfish, but I’m okay with that. I’m more concerned about finding a place to live and paying my bills rather than whether or not my cousin got the PS4 he was bitching about.

She’s watching basketball next to me and being racist towards the players saying their names in very odd ways to make fun of them. Earlier she called someone a n**ger lover. Honestly she makes family gatherings so much more unenjoyable. When I go over to her house, which is often, she has loud violent old tv or movies playing for my grandfather who has Alzheimer’s. He really enjoys the tv show Cheers and violent shows that she puts on often gives him delusions that he is in the war. Now that he has gone so far he can’t really speak any longer so I don’t think it upsets him anymore but it sure upsets me. She often brags about the “expensive” clothes and jewelry she has while only buying people things from boscovs and goodwill. She is grumpy, whiny, and so very hard to reason with. My mom has told me that she has always been like this and she has gotten better with age. She often comments on my weight and appearance making me feel very self conscious.

157,"Merry Christmas All,

Feeling lonely today for fairly obvious reasons. It's difficult having grown up for so long, feeling worthless and judged, and believe people actually care about you. I don't know how to express to the people in my life that I am not like them.

I'm sad. It's Christmas, and I'm alone, and I'm coming to terms that this is the way things will be for a while.

My family is nonexistent. Too much shared trauma and cruelty. My mother is my mother and regrets treating me badly and letting my stepfather treat me like an animal growing up.

 I was a fat kid before losing 50 pounds as a 16-year-old, all of which I've kept off the last four years due to an eating disorder I struggled with even before losing a third of my body weight. I was shy and plain; not very pretty, sporty, or wealthy in an affluent area. I was lucky enough to never have been bullied, just ignored. I was invisible. After losing weight, I was still painfully shy. 

I am 135 at 5""7; female; college student; I work out a lot, get good grades, stay skinny. Nobody I meet guesses who I was. I went to a large high school and then a very small college. My boyfriend happens to be from the same high school as me, a few years older. He was athletic and popular. A jock. He never knew me in high school, and I've never told him I was plain and fat. He knows I struggle with eating but doesn't know the reasons why. 

It is extremely difficult for me to eat in front of others, especially in large groups. I cannot eat junk food in front of other people. Some days, I don't eat at all and just drink black coffee or water. My stepfather would constantly criticize how much I ate, what I ate, what I looked like, what my friends looked like, how my clothes fit, and anything else that could make me feel bad. He never hit me, but would threat, get very close to (taking off my glasses so he wouldn't have to replace them if he did, chasing me up the stairs or around the house, throwing food or objects/clothes at me) and he was very angry and critical of my personality or the things I would say or do. I learned to basically shut up around him to get as little of a reaction as possible, but this did not always work. I was kicked out officially right before I started college three years ago. I limit contact with my mom because of all of this, but she guilt trips me into going to holidays, like tonight. We are eating dinner together.

This eating together required me not eating at all yesterday, and restricting the day before, so that I'll eat a regular meal tonight and not feel bad about myself after. I feel like nobody likes me or loves me, even though I do have some good friends and my mother is sorry for the way I was treated. Sometimes, it's like the damage is done and I'll never be a normal person again. 

I know the way I act confuses people. I look normal, like a regular 20 year old pretty girl in college. Nobody knows the sacrifices and the horrible things that got me here; the abuse, the eating or lack thereof, the throwing up, the wanting to die. Nobody knows how shitty my family really is or how ashamed I am to share genes with them, or how ashamed I am of myself for being ashamed. The guilt is endless and overwhelming.

Not just that, but I distinctly remember the rejection and isolation I received as a fat, unattractive, socially awkward girl, vs the confusion and attempts at niceness I receive now. People want to like me, or want me to like them. I like people, but I don't trust them. I rarely want to tell people anything about myself because I don't want to make them uncomfortable, or I'm afraid they won't believe me or they won't understand what I went through. I wasn't raped or beat. But the emotional damage has been done and I have almost no self-esteem. I internalized all of my stepfather and mother's criticisms and cruelty, and I don't know how to get over it. I want to.

I'm in therapy, school, work 2 jobs at college, fully independent except for health insurance, and pay all of my own bills and have never gotten monetary help from my mother or stepfather, even for school/food/rent/gas like many of my peers. I am exhausted, to be honest. I watched my boyfriend open Christmas presents yesterday, and my best friend/roommate open hers today. Of course, I was happy for them, but I felt awkward and sad to just get socks and a coffee giftcard, thoughtful presents I am grateful for, but definitely neutral/""I don't know you"" presents.  I watch my friends develop healthier friendships and relationships because they have a family to fall back on. I am lonely, and feel simultaneously too grown up and too immature.

I'm trying really hard to break the abuse/addiction cycle that runs in my family, but it isn't easy. I've made a lot of mistakes and pushed people away. I've kept some wrong people in my life because I have poor judgement when it comes to how I should let myself be treated, and I fall for manipulation tactics and guilt trips because I'm scared to be alone.

I guess I just want advice on how to move on, and how to be normal again. I was a really happy kid, before my mom dated my stepdad.",25Dec2019,1
159,"So normally going home is an exciting time in a young military members life; however, I recently started having anxiety attacks around groups of people and have realized that I’d rather it just be me and a few friends if it me completely alone.

She's an awesome old lady, I've always thought so and it was cool to have a conversation with her. Then we went to his parents', his mum made a delicious Turkey sandwich, didn't kick up a fuss that we weren't staying, no passive aggressive comments. And when we got home, we cooked a delicious roast beef dinner. That part didn't go perfectly but it was still so damn good. We watched some Lost in Space and some christmas movies, one in the morning and one this evening, we had some wine, spent time with the cat. 

I'm just happy, I'm so happy.",25Dec2019,1
