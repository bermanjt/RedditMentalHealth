1,"Thank you for not ticketing me. I was in unfamiliar area, has completely missed the speed limit sign, and was in a rush to get to my sons football game. 

You listened, understood it was genuinely not a blatant act of wrecklessness. You  old me you had a football practice of your sons to get to also, and what good would speeding do me if I got in a wreck and killed myself trying to get there.

You gave me back my ID and told me to slow down so I could live to see another game. 

You didn't know I was secretly trying not to break down because I knew the expense of a speeding ticket would take away from my sons birthday tomorrow. You didn't know how important it was to my son for me to be there today, and even though it was slightly delayed, I still made it...just more humbled. 

Thank you for being human, and treating me like a human. My last name sounds Hispanic, and in today's racial climate, you just never know how people will react. I appreciate you treating me like you would like to be treated in that situation. 

I was honest, did not deny my speed, and I was straight forward about how I found myself going so quick. I did not expect a positive outcome. Thank you for surprising me.",15Aug2019,675
2,"Everyone I get close to winds up leaving. I tried telling one girl who I thought I was close with about some tough stuff that was happening and she kept interrupting and changing the topic and having entirely different conversations with my brother. They're entire family thinks my brother is so much cooler, I don't even know why. The older one that I'm close with basically ignores me (of course I see it now and not earlier) it's now like I have feelings but I want her as a close friend.

I would try to find other people to hang out with but when you're homeschooled it's really hard (ik, being homeschooled makes me an even bigger loser). When I'm with people I can make them laugh and usually can impress a good bit of people (I can do a good bit of flips) but I still have few friends and even fewer close friends. 


I'm sorry for the rant y'all, if you guys had any advice it'd be really appreciated",15Aug2019,1

I know for a fact I am not staying in this cold ass climate. Also know I want to eventually live off passive income. But I have no exact clue what I want to do next.

12,"I don’t know if this goes here but I just wanted literally anyone to see it. I’m always down, not necessarily sad but just grey and uncaring and I don’t know if anyone else feels the same. I just go about my day the way I should and I never do anything different it’s just what I do so I do it. I go to work when I have to and the gym all the time to get myself out. I’ll go see family and try to hang out with people although I don’t have any real friends and the ones I did I found out actually don’t care after 15 years. When I don’t work I just go to the gym and do nothing. I’m not suicidal (although when I was younger I was) but like if I die  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I know people love me and sometimes I do feel kinda happy but it seems to go anyway so fast and I really don’t know if everyone just feels like they are going through the motions or if it’s just me. When I do see people or hang out with acquaintances I tend to forget the grey but then when I’m done I just feel exhausted and wonder if I’ve just gotten really good at faking a smile. Im not sure what to do or if others feel the same grey days that I seem to always feel. That’s all.

13,"So I am processing through this one.  My neighbor is an active old man, who is the slumlord of the property next door.  He is doing a bunch of improvements on the place and don't get me wrong I appreciate that, I really don't appreciate the way he does them.

I have posted this in r/Chainsaw but was unsure of where to post this story.  I have also sought out the AITA community's opinion and I'm mostly not an asshole.

Before I get into this let me explain that I am a very competent laborer.  I no longer work as a laborer, but as a laborer I have built hiking trails, restored ecosystems, fought wildfires, built landscaping features and installed solar panels.  I can operate some heavy equipment and repair most basic-medium difficulty problems on equipment.  Tools I do have are typically mid-top of the line and I have a number of specialized tools for different tasks.  A big part of my career has been running a chainsaw.  I'm not the best by any means, but I am comfortable and confident.

The house next door to me is a dump.  And that doesn't really bother me because I don't live there and it being a dump allowed us to purchase our house.  The guy who owns it is a slumlord.  Previous tenants would throw trash over the fence and were basically useless tweakers.  Our house was pretty cheap so it was worth getting the house to deal with some of the shitty stuff that has happened here.  That was until this last week.

Last friday I was cutting a small tree that hangs over the fence from the neighbor's side.  I cut pretty meticulously and I have a pretty nice professional quality chainsaw.  When I do run a saw for people I charge a very high hourly for the area in which I live.  As I am cutting this tree a car goes by with a guy casing the house next door.  I wave him down and ask him if he is the owner.  He says yes and I ask him if he was going to hire somebody to take out the trees in his yard.  He replied that it wasn't a big deal and he would cut them himself.  Uhhhh ok buddy.  Sure you will.

So that was last week. And then last friday I am walking down the stairs around 8 am after a long night with a teething baby. I have just had the first sip of coffee when I see the tree closest to my house has a rope actively putting tension on the top of the tree and my slumlord neighbor is 2.5 inches into a dutchmen at about knee height. No eye protection and he's looking away as he cuts. He's running a 16"" bar jonsared that's running hot and this is most likely the first cut he has made with that saw since last year. From the sound he is running old ethanol gas with the cheapest two stroke mix and the mix is either lean or his tuning screws are off. He's using the cheapest yellow nylon truckers rope from walmart to pull the tree from a truck and he has it tied to only one branch.

So to define the terms in the above paragraph a dutchmen (didn't make up the term) is where the cuts don't line up on the front of the tree.  Chainsaws are very tempermental and sensitive to poor quality gas, they are two strokes which means that the oil must be mixed with the gas.  When two stroke engines have bad gas, they either don't run or run too hot, which means that the engine is moving too fast, not getting the lubrication it needs and it runs when the throttle isn't being pushed.  Basically it means the chain is moving whether the trigger is pushed or not.  Ropes are rated for weight, ropes can usually take 1.5 times their rated weight.

It took me five seconds flat to figure out that this guy had zero business dropping trees anywhere near my house. Also pertinent he is 73 years old and most likely a gym rat. I have no doubts that this senior citizen could easily whoop my ass. That's one of the pieces that comes into play as I watch in horror.

I yanked the AC unit out of the window and started screaming obscenities at him. I know this isn't the right thing to do. ""Call a professional, you cut like shit. Jesus fucking christ that's a 50% fucking facecut."" It went on and I was an asshole and my obscenity laden rant contained each detail mentioned above beautifully punctuated with fucks and shits. Fully own that I had an unhinged rant at the dude. That's the first time I have ever felt my protective father instincts kick in.

To explain a facecut is the cut that is put in the direction the tree will fall, it's a triangle taken out of the tree and then you do the back cut to put the tree on the ground.  The backcut is a cut that comes from behind, you are left with your holding wood or hinge which is how the fibers flex and the tree goes down.  When trees are cut properly you can guide them down pretty predictably.

They had the truck yank the tree down and he cut through 3/4 of his holding wood. Cutting through your holding wood

Fully aware I shouldn't have ranted at the guy between his gigantic dutchman and him cutting through the holding wood. I would have appreciated a heads up that he was cutting, he very intentionally started right after my wife left though, so it seems like he is at least somewhat self aware that he is death on wheels with a chainsaw. The tree is about 10 feet away from my house, leans toward my house and is over the part of the upstairs where my son's crib is. The tree falls with minimal incident.

The slumlord was pretty proud of himself that dropped the tree with minimal incident. It whipped through another tree and little broken pieces broke off and flew everywhere. 

He started yelling at me that I was a moron for being concerned. Fuck that dude. Let's just say that in a lot of ways I'm a millennial stereotype and I was triggered as fuck by his terrible chainsawing.  Let's just say that cutting through your holding wood is a huge fuckup in the world of running chainsaws.  You cede control over where the tree will go to wind, gravity and inertia, you and your chainsaw have rolled the dice on where it will land.  He had it tied to a truck, but still shitty fucking cutting.  

Oh gosh the day went on. And on. My son is napping a ton these days so I can get him out somewhere for maybe 2-3 hours tops. There are tons of awesome places to go where I live, but it's hard to mobilize and have that short window. So I am kind of stuck at the house. I move the crib to the basement and have him take naps there. I was stuck at home having to listen to an incompetent person running a chainsaw.

He starts on the other tree which leans toward the other side of his narrow lot. Under this tree is a brand new shed with a really, really nice roof. Like a 100 year metal roof. There is also a chainlink fence which is crappy, but it serves a purpose and the neighbors on that side don't want it gone.

Slumlord decides it's time for tree two, which 6 days and 20+ hours later is where he still is. The highlights of tree two are as follows.

Extension ladder goes into tree and the first few branches are cut rather quickly. But the saw is starting to have problems. It's running when the throttle isn't depressed and it won't start in the tree, so one of the guys starts it on the ground and then carries it up into the tree on the extension ladder to the slumlord who's in the tree. The extension ladder is at times on one foot. At one point they wonder aloud what made the saw stop working and it turns out they ran it out of bar oil. Around 2pm the saw goes silent.

At different times he climbs the tree and tries to shake branches down, or tries to cut them with a bow saw. At one point he falls from the ladder and ends up hanging by one hand from the tree.

They start cutting the branches over hanging the shed and pieces are falling. The neighbors on the side are pissed that this guy is just dropping sticks and dangling big branches over their shed while doing minimal stuff to prevent it from falling. Neither myself nor my neighbors feel like we can leave this guy alone, cause he will just fuck our stuff up.

At this point I have a few interactions with the guy. I ask him to at least put some plywood over their shed and checked the rental company website and found that a lift would be $200 and the tree could be done in a few hours. I asked him to consider hiring a professional to do it. He screams back at me and calls me a pussy. He tells me any tree that is leaning can just be cut through with a single cut and other really dumb things. At one point I called dispatch so they could keep a record in case of an insurance investigation and they sent a cop out to try to talk sense into him.

He built himself a little fort up there basically, he has 2x4's between the branches to help him stay balanced between cutting branches. He asked the other neighbor if he could remove their fence to drop the tree through their yard. They said no, and then after that he brought his tractor over with a pickaxe and a chain, perfect tools for yanking out a fencepost sunk in concrete.

The cops can't really do anything and he keeps having people over to look at it and stating to me that it can easily be dropped from ground. He has it cut so that the branch weight is on the opposite side from where it needs to fall. All of his carpenter buddies are scared off of it. I think it could be dropped from the ground, but it would need to be wedged in a way where it would roll to move a branch away from the shed/fence. I think I could do a tiny face cut, bore it and jam two wedges in on the side and then also have a truck pull it that way and get it, but he clearly isn't going to let me cut it.

He's reached a point every day where he comes to the yard, putters around, slips in the tree or on the ground and then goes home.  Today he came back with a new saw and he cut some branches rather competently.  But then he put a cable in the branches and tried to pull it down with his truck.  This isn't in a subdivision in a half acre lot, this is one block off of fucking main street in a tourist town and our lots are as wide as houses.  The tenant has a non moving truck, slumlord decided to pull truck forward so that the way the tree would fall would be an inch or so past the truck.  I saw him contemplating that drop at the bottom of the tree chainsaw in hand with the tree tensioned by the truck.  Just like totally fucked in the head wondering how close he can come to fucking things up.  Maybe he wants to fuck things up and get a check.  I honestly don't see that as a net loss.

He has until August 31st to cut the tree. I have a security camera trained on the area where the tree is. I have enlisted a few friends who are competent with chainsaws to act like they were just walking by and would be able to help him. But I am fully ready to come home one day to a tree somebody tried to yank over with an F-350 leaning up against my house or in my living room with slumlord out of state and no insurance on file.

A different neighbor stopped by and talked to him. Found out his wife died recently and that he used to have a business doing roofing and siding. Those things explain his mental state and comfort with being in a tree. But he is so incompetent with a chainsaw he didn't mix gas right and ran the saw out of bar oil. And I'm sorry if it makes me an asshole, but I want somebody who knows how to mix gas and uses bar oil cutting trees near my house.  Also maybe somebody who is able to line up the cuts and doesn't fully rely on a truck or tractor to yank the tree down.  Maybe somebody with the sense to wear a hardhat.

He plans to yank the stumps out with his tractor.  Which is not an acceptable way to handle that problem in city limits, much less a block from a busy small downtown.  I don't trust this asshole to not fuck up the gas line tanking out these stumps.

Also I think chauvinism is a big part of what drives this guy.  The other neighbors who have been pleading with him to hire somebody competent are lesbians and I appear to be about 25, I'm older but I look very young.  My yard is full of flowers and at any point in time I have 2-3 prius's because I am learning how to refurb the batteries.  The only people he listens to are older men.  I've heard him tell his buddies that I am a pussy ass millennial who needs to man the fuck up.  Like I said his terrible cutting triggers me, but the asshole is about to drop a tree on my safespace.  

Anyways, that's my story and here is a link to the pictures. I hope he finishes soon without damaging anything.

Before the negative, I want to at least give myself some leeway and at least tell myself that I'm good at socializing, much much better than most people are. People seem to be attracted to me wherever I go, not even romantically speaking. This and having a greater deal of empathy and compassion than others seem to be the literal only things I am good at. Maybe I'm greedy in thinking this way.

&amp;#x200B;

When I'm really invested in a game or something I care about, I get incredibly frustrated at myself for not being better and I beat myself into a depressive stump trying to figure out why I can't be good like others. Sometimes I'm not sure if it goes the other way and I'm actually an egoist who can't stand not being at the top. At least when I think about it, I don't want to be on the top for the sake of being better than others, I just want to be good at something.  I used to be a shit tier student and now I'm on top of my game, but even then I still can't get things as fast as others. For one of my classes a year ago, I had to work so much harder for my A than the other students in that class I know did.

I try coping by having substitutes for instance games and friends. But i cannot stand myself anymore I have been way to emotional. And this might be weird but every time i look or think about my ex girlfriend i start crying because i will never have someone like her. It is a stretch but it just keeps haunting me. I try substituting it by getting another girlfriend but that does not work out too. It will be a cycle from there because i am a loving person. And i fall in love very quickly with people.

My yard is full of flowers and at any point in time I have 2-3 prius's because I am learning how to refurb the batteries. The only people he listens to are older men. I've heard him tell his buddies that I am a pussy ass millennial who needs to man the fuck up. Like I said his terrible cutting triggers me, but the asshole is about to drop a tree on my safespace.

Anyways, that's my story and here is a link to the pictures. I hope he finishes soon without damaging anything.

19,"I’m a young male (20) and I was always solid on my interest in females but I also thought I had a interest in males. I watch gay porn and I have a clear interest in it. However, for the past year, I’ve peaked my curiosity and have been experimenting off and on. I’ve did all the typical things that normal gay men do with each other but I always get turned off during sex and I never can come. I never have came when having any type of sexual activity with a guy. It makes me confused because I watch gay porn and think certain men are attractive, but then I do the real thing and I get nothing from it. In fact it causes me to take a break from doing anything with a guy for like 3 months because I get guilty and grossed out. 

Is this normal? Should I just stop experimenting? I’m sure most people don’t go to this extent when curious about this sorta thing.",15Aug2019,1
20,"So I (17) requested 6 days off to meet my family. I work part time for a grocery store. I requested it in advance (about 2 weeks), and also spoke to my manager in which he said its all good. I had three of those days accepted. However I didn't know they only accepted only 3 and not the six as I only saw the first three days as off on the weekly schedule. I came back from my trip and now I look at my schedule and was suppose to work on those days. What do I do, this was a mistake on my end, but I cant help but think why only 3 days out of 6, also they rejected my availability hours and Idk why but this is my schedule for school as it just started, I am scheduled on Friday and know they are going to call me in when I go to work,  I am worried that I will get fired, but also want to quit as I feel they are playing me. Idk I need advice.

29,"Hey r/self, I didn't know where else to post this because I'm sure my friends are sick of it, but for the first time in my life I'm actually excited for the future.
For context, the last four years of my life have been a bit shit. Been working a dead end retail job, got married and separated within a year, been playing in a band that was going nowhere thinking I was going to try and be some great musician, went through some issues with alcohol abuse and just last year got diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety after suffering a major anxiety attack that had me in a hospital for three days. I felt so defeated; felt so  meaningless and attempted suicide twice before. This year though, I decided that enough was enough and that the only person who can change my life is myself.

At the start of the year, I began studying in a field I'm passionate in (veterinary nursing) and obtained work placement. It's one day a week volunteering for experience. Which is great, but cause of full time work it was causing me to do 6-7 days a week working. So I took it one step further. Just last week, I was able to score a paying part time job as a nursing assistant at a vet clinic for two-three days a week. Not only is this a huge foot in the industry for me, but it's the first time I've had a job where ive been genuinely excited and happy to go to. I ended up going casual at my retail job but it's over an hour and a half away. Got a confirmation today that in three - four weeks I will be transferring to the store that is 10 min walk from my house. Doing two - three days depending on my vet roster. I've had all top marks in my assignments lately, and I think I've finally found what I want in life.

I'm sorry for the long winded post and I'm sorry if it sounds conceited but God damnit I'm proud of myself. Ive done it, I've solidified a path for myself and with more hard work and dedication it can only get better. I'm not going to let anybody stop me anymore. I think I'm finally worthy of something.

31,"I experienced one of my greatest fears: I was told that I’m hard to communicate with by someone I care about. Apparently, I was too quiet in each other’s presence. He expressed concern whether it meant a good or bad thing between us.

I notice I can be very quiet person. It’s not him. Maybe this is why some people would rather be around me when I’m drunk because they think I’m a more fun person intoxicated (who isn’t anyways?)

What’s funny is that I remember being this extremely shy ever since I was a kid. There was a boy I had a crush on and would always play with. And whenever I became his girlfriend, I would be too scared to be around him. He would get upset. I remember him asking, “How come whenever we are friends, you play with me but when I’m your boyfriend, you don’t want to play anymore?” I still don’t have the answer to that to this day.

My silence with my recent friend who expressed concern could actually be a mixture of things. It probably stems from the early notion I have that humans are intimidating. Betrayal, deception, disloyalty, and heartbreak are the only types of human interactions I can remember from childhood to now. I know what people are capable of. It seems the longer I live, the more interpersonal relationships I have, the more I find it hard to trust others. I’ve only ever known experiencing disappointment but never taught how to heal from it. It’s just so hard interacting with others. This is probably why I walk around with my guard up. It’s probably why I choose to be an active listener rather than a talker. It’s probably why my creative outlet of choice is writing. At least the paper and pen can’t judge or criticize me for what I write, how I write, and why I write. 

Ironically, in my recent friend’s and I particular situation, my silence meant that I was just comfortable with him and didn’t feel the need to distract from the silence when there was some. I felt peaceful being in his presence. I was also just warming up to understand who he is what he’s okay with talking about, joking about, crying about. 

So now I guess I’m quiet because I’m either shy, scared, or comfortable... 
No. That doesn’t make sense. 

I’m quiet because I’m too shy to be myself out of fear of judgement. I’m quiet because I’m scared to be vulnerable. I’m quiet because it’s easier to hide that way, which is more comfortable than exposing who I am.

The other day, he told me he wants to know more about my intellectual brain. I told him that as of recently, most of its capacity has been used for self-reflection and evaluation. So from now on, I think I will spend more time figuring out why I’m trying to hide from a world that is only eager for me to release and let free.

34,"I’m almost 24. I left after two years in 2017 and have had a couple short-term jobs since and one summer job that I can always rely on for a few thousand dollars.

36,"I just bought another (pair?) of nail clippers and was like “haha...” about it so thought id share. 

So a little over a year ago I went to marine corps boot camp. During boot camp I developed an extreme form of athletes foot.

Anyway yeah that place was disgusting and we didn’t get time to change socks, let our feet dry after showering etc plus it was boots from 4am till we went to bed. So yep. 

Eventually I fixed it and my feet went back to normal. @ boot camp &amp; until it went away I always thought “I’m gonna get nail clippers just for my feet” so I did and used them, after I’d be disgusted by saving them for next time so I’d throw em away.

Lately, though, it feels like it's getting worse. Most of the time I just feel kinda ""meh"" and nothing makes me feel anything at all. Some days I wake up feeling like trash. Not just bad, but like I wish I were dead levels of trash. Nothing seems to protect me from this. I still get myself out of bed and get my shit done, but it takes everything I have to not curl up into a ball and cry. On the other hand, some days I just feel great and literally nothing can ruin my mood.

I have found out my general life situation has some effect. When my friendships and/or relationships are going well, it helps cut down on the bad days. When I have my shit together I have fewer bad days as well but when I do get them they're much worse. That said, no matter what every day feels like a dice roll and it's really starting to wear me down.

43,"Long story short, I talked to this girl for a while, we got kinda close, she said she was interested in me and I said I was too, then a few days later she changed her mind and wanted to be friends instead, but she would still talk to me and even agreed to hang out again, which was cool, but also, along with everything else made me VERY confused.

So, today I decided to just be direct and clear with her, as I was still overthinking every little thing that had just happened, and I had convinced myself that I screwed it all up, that I made her change her mind about me, that everything that went wrong between us was all because of me, and yet, I still didn’t know what exactly I did wrong, and that made me feel like utter shit, and this wasn’t the first time I had done something like this, I’ve overthought and over analyzed the little things multiple times before in other situations, and it really took a toll on me as I thought that it was all my fault, every single time, but I never actually knew what I did wrong, until today, I set my fears aside and took a risk, I did something that I’ve never had the courage to do before, I told the truth about how I was feeling, what I was thinking and asked her why she changed her mind.

This was a big step for me as I had never been this honest with anyone before, I’m naturally a very secretive person, my closest friends don’t even know the half of me because I find it extremely, very hard to open up. Anyways, she responded and cleared everything up for me, she said she was in fact interested in me at the start, but then realized that she wasn’t really ready for a relationship, with her moving schools, and her getting serious about cheer, she didn’t want anything to really distract her, she said “it really is not you, it’s me.” Which I know sounds fake, and it may be, but I’m going to choose to believe her, because I asked her to be honest about her answer and that I wouldn’t be offended, and I trust that she wouldn’t be the type of person to lie in a situation like that, on top of that, she still wants to hang out and be friends, if it really were me, she wouldn’t be wanting to spend any more time with me that’s for sure.

This whole ordeal has taught me, no, showed me that I need to be more direct and decisive when it comes to expressing my feelings and sharing my thoughts, I’ve never done that with anyone until today and it’s made me realize that if I don’t share how I’m feeling and what I’m thinking in order to get a direct answer to any questions I may have, I will most definitely overthink myself into oblivion, and yeah it still hurts that I can’t be with her, but that’s life, you don’t always get what you want and sometimes you just gotta hurt, because it makes you a better person like with what happened to me today.",15Aug2019,24

51,"I came home the other morning after my third consecutive night shift. All three were pretty typical, with the last one being a little crazier than usual, as it sometimes goes. It was my first of three nights off, and I was really looking forward to some sleep and some quality time with my SO. 

My two year anniversary at my first nursing job is approaching. I work in neurology/neurosurgery. In a busy hospital, at the bedside. In the two years I have been doing this, I have been exposed to many things that I did not anticipate. Conditions—and sides of human beings—I never knew existed. Some days I love what I do, and other days I swear I made the wrong career choice. Nursing is hard. There’s little support. We wear a hundred hats. We care for too many very sick patients at a time because we are chronically understaffed, and we often do it with empty stomachs and full bladders. We are yelled at by patients, families, and administrators. We are hit. Spat on. Have body fluids thrown in our direction. And a lot of the time it’s *not the patients fault*. They are sick with neurological diseases that make them terrified, profoundly confused shells of the people they used to be. 

Over the course of the aforementioned shifts, I cared for multiple patients who have a deadly and aggressive type of brain tumor. Very poor prognosis. The patients I have treated who have this cancer over the last two years have tended to be on the younger side. And they tend to be surrounded with family; parents and spouses, as one would hope to see present in support of a young dying person. Anecdotally, I am seeing an uptick in the number people with this condition as of late. 

So I came home and showered. Then I fell asleep. This is typical for me, but so are the nightmares. They are becoming increasingly severe and making for restless sleep that seems pointless upon waking up exhausted. My body hurts. I have chronic low back pain. My mind is racing with pictures of my patients and my own loved ones hypothetically in their position much of the time. I wake up usually around 3-4pm and attempt to spend time with my SO who—thanks to opposing work schedules and 13+ hour shifts—I sometimes don’t see for three days despite living together. But I’m too tired to interact very much. I’m too achy and I’ve spent basically all of my emotional energy on strangers and their families. I go out for date night despite feeling like this, because I love and miss my SO. 

We get home late and SO goes to sleep. I stay up until about 7am because that is how I sleep now due to night shift. At this point I am feeling alright. A little better than before. I open the reddit app for a little mindless scrolling, and immediately read a post on R/relationships (I love the drama) where a poster was asking for advice on how to deal with some specific circumstances of a disease that their father was diagnosed with. This disease happened to be the same brain tumor I mentioned above. And I don’t know why but I just lost it. Burst into inconsolable tears. I didn’t stop crying for a long time. And I started thinking about my patients and also about how their spouses must feel. They are so young and beautiful. And they are spending the early years of their marriages at the bedsides of their dying loves. I thought of my own spouse. We are newly married. What the fuck would I do if this ever happened to my love? I have thoughts sometimes that I hope I die first because I couldn’t bear to go through something even remotely like what I have seen on the job. I feel so fucking awful for these people and for their loved ones. Most people really are good. *Nobody* deserves this shit. 

I am burning out. I am so early in this career and I am already burning out hard. I work with people who have been at it for decades. And they are so strong. I feel like I’m weak. Like I am perhaps not built for this. But I don’t know. I don’t want to leave. Like I said, some days I love my work. And I love my team so much. I just don’t know anymore. 

Sorry this is so long. I am not really sure what I hope to gain from posting this. It’s 4:30am and I’m alone on my couch while my spouse and the rest of the city is asleep and I just have a ton of shit on my mind. Thanks for reading my post, if you’ve made it this far.

54,"Technically and literally, I realized I just grew up! At age 34, my mind has become strong and I now know what I want and what I do not want.
Don’t get me wrong, before now, I thought I knew those things but I just realized I have been misled.
Just a decade ago I had a great guy in my life who really loved me but guess what? I didn’t know I loved him too. 
I look back at my life a decade ago I call my self stupid! It might be a harsh word to use on my self but that is the word that practically describes how i was then. I took a lot of things for granted and unluckily for me I didn’t have anyone who was advising me to go the other way so my own way was always the way.
If you are still young and reading this, let me tell you something, make friends with people that are outside your age bracket even though you have a few within your age bracket. 

Always make sure you have a wide adult you can talk to about anything. It will help you.

55,"I finally gave her the chocolates or the chocolate with  caramel bars; she did accepted it. Was saving those for her. We had different schedules and different areas of assignments so I had not gave the time to have a conversation with her. ☺️

But I am not even sure if she is single or not. Or if she just wants to be friends. 😖

56,"I know that I should work on myself more and I am in fact, experiencing and trying new things at university which is great.

Lately, I've been plagued with thoughts of loneliness. I feel like nothing I do is ever enough for myself and I need someone to feel validated. I wish I got praised sometimes. But alternatively, I feel like there's nothing to praise. 

My friends don't seem enough anymore. I feel like I am in one sided friendships with people because they don't make the effort in them. I want to go do things with people, go out and have fun. We're busy because of university. I get it. I do things by myself just fine but sharing those experiences with someone seems more fulfilling.

I wish I had someone I could tell all my thoughts to, and they would do the same, enthusiastically, in a relationship. 

I feel tired and empty. Wish I had that connection with someone to talk to. 

And no, I don't want to go to therapy or counselling. I've tried counseling before and it doesn't help. Talking endlessly with someone to no end is draining. I feel like they don't care what I say and try to 'figure' me out.",15Aug2019,1
57,"My boyfriend died last year. I didn't even know it was possible to feel this sad about anything. I'm doing a lot better than I was, but there are still times where it all just feels like the end of the world again. He was my first love and I was his. We only had a year together, but it felt like so much longer. We did so much together and although neither of us talked about what the future might hold (we were both at University, so there weren't really any plans other than getting through that lol), I don't think either of us imagined that there might be a time where we wouldn't have each other.

It all happened very suddenly. His death was a complete accident, so for a long time I think all I could feel was shock. Then for a long time all I could feel was sadness/anger/helplessness. Now, although what happened still completely breaks my heart, I am looking forward to what the future might hold. I can't bring myself to think about meeting anyone else yet, but being alone isn't a prospect that terrifies me as much as it did in the first couple of months after he died. 

I always thought it was such a cliché thing to say when people said ""a part of me died with them"", but that's something I now completely empathise with and also something I find a bit of comfort in. A part of me, the me I was before he died, will always be with him. I'm incredibly jealous of that me. I wish I was still that me. But it does give me some comfort that nothing can separate that me from him. If that makes any sense.",15Aug2019,9

63,"I (26M) still cant figure out if i got depression or not. Sometimes i would live 2-3 weeks not feeling a damn emotion but all of a sudden one day i break down and i get the feeling that my life is worthless. If anyone suggests go talk to a professional let me tell you where i live, or about the culture im stuck with, where i come from if you seek help regarding mental health issues you will be convicted as a crazy guy so seeking help by a dr is not a real option for me. I usually love to spend lots of time alone like not in the dark or in a closed room but arround people but totally alone with my music. Im a guy that got lot of friends but no matter what i feel numb at the end of the day like i dont have friends even tho i have bunsh of real clos2 friends i share everything with them but recently due to most of my friends got out the country i barely share anything with anyone. I a shy calm guy, i dont feel comfortable arround new people so i stay in silence most the times but whenever im feeling it you cant hold me back. I always convince my self im not  depressed, but everyone arround me keeps telling me why you dont talk you seems so depressed. I get anxious very fast but im good with hiding my feels like you wont guess either im happy or sad. I love my family so much but let me tell you i cant stand staying at home for than an hour which i found so weird. I really keep telling myslef im okay its all good but when im allone i keep wondering: am i depressed?

65,"I guess the best way to start this is kind of give a run down of my situation: 
I’m a 15 year old boy, and I’d say I’m relatively happy in my life and myself now - I have a great girlfriend who I love and loves me, a caring family and a great school. I have fantastic friends I’d die for in a heartbeat, both girls and boys, from different backgrounds, sexualities and religions. Life is great - I’m in a mature environment where I can express who I really am and I can have fun everyday at school.

Today I went out with my girlfriend (M) and a friend (A). A is transgender, male to female, and while her sex is still male, she identifies as a female. We just went out and had fun today after school, we went to M’s house briefly, and walked up to the mall, stopping at the park and all going on the one big swing. We watched the clouds pass and just lay on the swing, all cuddled up together and smiling. 

We messed around and acted like kids, climbing up street poles and getting stupid photos, playing with each other’s hair and physically bear-hugging and wrestling. We walked around the mall, going onto the roof and watching the sun set, going into the music store and making songs, just acting like normal teenagers free from our problems at home and school. 

I hung out with A after M left with her family, and we talked about our problems, sitting on the ledge of the roof and enjoying the city view in the cool evening. A apparently finds me attractive, and I think has a bit of a playful crush on me, but in a playful way where everyone knows and it’s nothing to ever act on, so it’s kind of flattering to me. 

I guess today was the best day I’ve had in a while, cuddling and horsing around with my girlfriend and A, which I think was needed, as I really need affection to feel happy. I hope I can keep this up.",15Aug2019,44
66,"Last night I reached out and posted my feels regarding period pain and the other shitty stuff that comes with it.
The comments I received were so helpful and supportive and I wanted to share a summed up version of my take aways:

- It’s ok to feel grumpy and negative during this time, just don’t take it out on others.
- limit face to face interactions when feeling this way.
- we don’t need to be 100% positive all of the time.
- there is and should never be shame around the affects of pms
- chocolate and movies help take our minds off the negativity
- reaching out.

Period pain isn’t just cramping. Often it comes with feelings of depression, irritability, etc.
Feelings like these won’t last long but it’s hard to understand why you’re feeling these things when off your period, you don’t.
Personally it does not hit me much at all but on the occasionally few times a year, the blues and emotions kick in and it causes me to feel lack of control because I can’t piece together why.
And really, there is no piecing. It’s an affect of extreme things happening inside of the body and it can be overwhelming for the mind too.

Hope that makes sense and I hope for anyone who takes this seriously, got something from this post ✨🌸",15Aug2019,4

Growing up I want allowed to express myself in ways that truly made me feel beautiful when I looked in the mirror.

My coworker has started to copy my style, not even being subtle about it and I've been surprised to realize that I feel really weird about it.

70,"I know a guy named Phil. We've known each other since we were kids. We had a lot of the same interests back then, but not so much anymore. 

He is easily one of the most intelligent people that I know, and he has an uncanny ability to read people. We were playing poker once. He knew how to play, and I was just learning. He was able to accurately predict what hand I had based on card counting and reading my actions. I would never play cards with him for money.

His family was always tight lipped about what they did for a living. To this day, I have no idea what either of his parents do for a living. His sister studied animals in college, and she won't ever say exactly what she does for a living. His sister's husband studied finance in college. He says he ""works for the government"", but won't elaborate beyond that.

At his house, they had a lot of riddle books. We would often sit around and try to figure out some of the harder riddles in the book. Sometimes we were successful, sometimes we weren't. We would work together to solve the riddles, and were pretty evenly matched. It was always a good time. 

As we got older, he seemed to think less of me due to my rural upbringing and background. We would still hang out, but when we were around his other friends, he treated me like I was just a simple hick. It always bothered, and I'm sure that he knew.

Right out of high school, he was an asset protection agent for a major big box retailer, and was very good at his job. He was effortlessly able to catch people stealing, apprehend them, and turn them over to the police. He kept this job while attending college in upstate New York. He wanted to pursue a career in law enforcement, specifically crime scene investigation. He had seasonal jobs as a police officer at a tourist/beach area. He also had an internship with the New York State Police. After college, he applied for some jobs with metro police departments as a crime scene technician. He was told that he'd have to start at the bottom as a patrol officer and work his way up through the ranks; which would take years. He chose to stay at the big box retailer as an asset protection agent for awhile longer.

Now he lives in California and works for ""the government"". Seems like he's joined the rest of his family in being tight lipped about his career. I don't hear from him much anymore. He's getting married next year, and I'm excited to go out there for the wedding. It'll be great to see him again after a few years. I'm glad I know a guy named Phil.",15Aug2019,1

72,"To start off, we are both 17 (although I turn 18 in a week). We’ve had close call before where she has been almost two weeks late. However, I am a scared little bitch when it comes to pregnancy. 

She went on vacation for two weeks, and while she was on vacation our relationship got a little rocky. 

We did have sex in the days before she left. She isn’t on any birth control so I always use a condom, but I usually start off by going raw. Anyway, I always cum inside with a condom on. Even though I didn’t notice any holes in the condom, I’m still a little on edge on whether I should worry so much or not. We are getting a test if her period does not start within the next two days. She’s anti-abortion, so that makes it even more stressful. 

If you have any advice I would love to hear it. All genres please. Thank you for reading.",15Aug2019,1
74,"So for some reason, I thought 30 last number, so I told my aunt my ”so-called” true fact. When I told that my aunt told me there was a number called 100 I was confused and we basically started a debate on numbers. I said that 30 was last and my aunt said 100 existed. This debate was going on for about 8 minutes until my aunt pulled up a 100$ bill. I was silent for an hour

Here's the second story, when I just got my iPad 4 I was obsessed with Minecraft let's play videos so I had one solution to control my boredness; Minecraft. I had requested my mom to purchase Minecraft and it was the PE version, not PC. Even though my parents rejected Minecraft I never gave up and came up with a plan. In order to get it and trick them into thinking it was free, I had to first press the buy so the type your password popup will, therefore, hiding the price so all I need is to get them to type the password and...





It worked. For the first time, I had never been so happy.



Third story:

75,"Six members of my family (including me) are going to be going to Portugal next year around the time school is still on going. This means if we want to take my sister with us, there is a fine of £60 to pay per week she is out of school. My aunt was looking into it a little more and it turns out that each parent must pay £60 even if they are not living together.

So say if my mum was to have £60 to spare some weeks, she could do something that week with my sister and pay the fine. Also meaning my dad would have to pay £60 per week this is done as well. 

My dad isn’t exactly the best father figure. He’s always treated us like his “mates” rather than his kids. He is also mentally abusive, but is still allowed to see us. So hypothetically he would have to pay the £60 unexpectedly where my mum would be prepared for such payments!

TL/DR: for each week my mum decides to take my sister out of school for whatever reasons, she must pay a £60 fine. This fine would also have to be paid by my emotionally abusive dad who doesn’t even live with us.

76,"since we broke up over a year ago we blocked each other on everything, and i haven't seen a new photo of her since then pretty much. last night i searched her instagram expecting it to be private, but it wasn't. my heart dropped because i expected to be hurt.

gladly, i feel even further apart from her because now looking at her pics, it's like i don't even know her. she looks a different. she looks older. she even seems more mature which is actually what she needed, i can tell by the look on her face and just the way she was standing in her photos.

that's not the girl i dated and loved... but that makes me feel good seeing how much things have changed. the fork in the road has gotten wider and wider. thinking about lying next to her again is just so ancient and seems so weird and doesn't make sense anymore.

i used to stay up at night for months thinking what i could have done better for her to stay and how much i want her back but now i don't anymore. i want to meet that new girl and make her feel special, and create new memories and secrets with her.",15Aug2019,239
79,"Yeah, I just broke up with my long term girlfriend, who I hope’d to make my wife. The reason, and I quote: “You are awesome in every other way, but you are an emotionless bastard and I can’t take it anymore!”

That is what happened to me, a lot of people sent me messages like “Hey, are you ok?” “Wanna go out for some drinks or just grab a bite to eat?” And like similar stuff of people wanting to comfort me but I don’t feel bad, if she wanted to go then fine, go, it is nice to have someone to warm up your bed or make dinner ever so often but it is not like it is hard to do by myself. Neither her nor I talked much so it was pretty silent already, we were pretty similar, we wouldn’t say anything unless we had something to say, you would think the house is empty when we were inside. With other people i would force some (to me) unnatural expressions, twist my face to laugh, or try my best to look said if need be, but I didn’t want to wear that mask at hone and apparently she was expecting me to.

I still think we will het back together tho because I believe she is only throwing that fit because her mother died but, people die, i am a veteran (which is probably where all this started) and I have seen a lot of people die so death is just another part of our stay here on earth before going somewhere else or just dying.

I have a sense of humor, i usually am successful at making others laugh, but i don’t find many other things funny and I don’t remember truly laughing except for a few NEs (nose exhales) here and there.

I don’t think I am capable of truly loving someone, I never had any wish to go on a date or find a date, she was pretty much the one that asked me out because she found me manly, serious, grown-up, I was her type, where as I didn’t have a type. I only saw her as a relief, when I’m tired she would be there, when I needed something, she would try her best to get that, and in return I also went above and beyond to help her out. What I am trying to say is I don’t see a point in “love” i only wanted a wife because it was more “socially acceptable” and mutually beneficial.

Maybe I am a psychopath, mentally ill, but I dont know, can someone at least teach me how to act more empathetic, I believe that is the word.

Also, some of my close friends that accepted me said I look at life like a business, and when they are dealing with shit they like talking to me because I dont sugarcoat things and actually help them through their problems by giving then a harsh but necessary slap back to reality.

80,"She was my everything. I made so many mistakes and had a lot of problems but I was trying my all. I was in a bad place mentally. Suicidal thoughts swarmed my head daily, anxiety turned into anger and fear. I was trying to get myself help but I couldn't even begin to find my footing.

She left me earlier this year. She seems so much happier now. I doubt she even thinks of me. It hurts but if she's happy then I guess it's better this way. I thought we were going to be together forever. She told me that so many times.

I can't stop loving her though. I miss her so much. She was my best friend. I was so excited to share my life with such an amazing person. Her smile, our conversations, cooking with her. All of it. I miss it. I have no desire to be with another person. I have tried dating but I'm not over her, no where near it. I doubt I'll ever be. I've never felt this way for somebody. 

I have been working on myself the last few months. Really working through all my problems. I got on antidepressants, that helped clear my mind quite a bit. I pretty much stopped watching porn and that's actually helped a bunch of other stuff. The suicidal thoughts are not there anymore. I also just figured out that my meltdowns were from severe anxiety. I'm getting that in order now. Like I feel like a new person. I actually feel whole again doing all this.

83,"I was in love with my highschool sweetheart for years and when the time came I asked her and she said yes with all her heart. I loved her more than anything in the world. But unfortunately she faced a car accident and didn't survive. It killed me in a way I couldn't bare to live. I needed a change and moved to a new city and started fresh. But I never felt the same way. I couldn't feel about anyone the way I felt about her. I met a few girls who were into me. But I couldn't feel anything I got some friends in the new place and fast forward it has been 5 years. A couple of years ago I met a girl at my workplace. She didn't stay long and moved to another job soon. But we stayed in touch. We got to know each other and got along really good. I always liked her. At that time she was recovering from a bad break up. As days passed she showed interest in me more than a friend. She started flirting with me now and then. I was surprised but it made me feel different. For the first time I felt fine. I never thought I could feel for someone like that. I fell for her. She showed all signs of wanting to have a relationship. Just when I was ready to ask her to be my girlfriend, her ex bf came back. They had a serious fight. She previously told me all about him. I told I will support her in case she needs. But in after a couple of days she called me and said that she got back with her boyfriend and was extremely happy about it. I couldn't believe it. She pretended like we had nothing between us and started to treat me like a friend. It broke me into pieces. I cried out for days. It took me months to get over her. I convinced myself to never get into serious relationship again. Atleast now. Meanwhile we didn't contact each other. Suddenly she came back into my life as a friend. I didn't feel the way i used to but I still helped her in certain things. I heard from a mutual friend that she broke up with her bf again. Now she is showing interest in me again. It emotionally killed me to get over her. But now I'm afraid I'm falling for her again. I really don't know what to do.

86,"I've walked by his door a few times when I've had the dogs out and noticed the package, but didn't really think much of it until today. One of our other neighbors made a group text to ask if anyone else had noticed it, and that his car hasn't moved in five days either. I've also noticed his blinds are down and drawn- unusual because he *always* has them pulled up to where I can see his giant TV when I walk past.

We live in condos, and his is top-floor and without a garage, meaning that his front door is the only way in or out of his unit. He lives by himself, doesn't really respond when anyone says hi or speaks to him, and rarely has visitors. And clearly no one has come or gone in at least five days.

Now, it's very possible that he's on vacation or something. That he carpooled to the airport and just closed up shop before leaving. He does have a cat, but maybe he took it with him or left it in someone else's care while he's gone. But it just seems odd that, with how long it's been, *no one* has come or gone to get mail or check on the place.

Full disclosure- I looked at his name on the package (which has his middle name listed), then tried to look him up on social media to see if he was posting vacation photos or anything. Couldn't find him on Facebook or Instagram. Typing his full name into Google yielded literally *two* results: an obituary from 2012 in our town, listing him as a surviving grandchild, and a record of birth certificate from 1989 with his name. I even checked other people listed in the survived-bys in the obit (who looked to be his siblings/cousins) and their profiles did not have anyone listed with his name in their Friends or Following lists. He's pretty well off-grid.

I contacted our HOA just a bit ago, hoping they had his number. The HOA rep found it and tried to call him, but it went straight to voicemail. She also had an email listed for him and sent him an email. She said she'll let me know tomorrow whether he's responded to it.

If he doesn't respond to the email I'm going to call the police for a wellness check. His windows are up high so they can't peek into them- all they can do is ring the doorbell, which one of our other neighbors already did and got no response. Don't know if the police can/will enter without a warrant.

Again, this could all just be him leaving on a summer vacation and not setting up for someone to check on his place while he's gone. But I worry because he's a bit reclusive, lives alone and the place has been shuttered and untouched for at least five days. Hate to notice these sorts of things, not say anything, and find out the worse-case scenario happened...",15Aug2019,3

It's been almost a month since I talked with him.  I've been traveling.  He's been busy on several projects.  It's not abnormal for us to go a month or two without catching up.

He worked for JC Penney for the last 30 years.  He was hoping to retire next year.

He's put the majority of his retirement savings in company stock.  When I met him about a decade ago, he asked me about it.  I suggested he put at least half of it in other stocks or mutual funds.  JCP has been on the decline for a long time.  As far as I know, he never followed that advice.  I think when I met him, JCP traded at around $12 a share.  They are less than a dollar now.

The friend who told me about his death told me he died holding JCP's earnings release issued this morning.  I'm sick.  Don't know what to do.",15Aug2019,7

100,"I miss this woman so much. She left me because I was depressed and my anxiety and anger got the best of me. She gave me so many chances. She said she wanted to marry me. Spend her life with me. She promised we would always be together. It's almost been a month since I've ever spoken to her. I've been blocked by her now, no way to contact her. She wants nothing to do with me.

I am so in love with her. I fucked up so bad. My heart breaks every day. I don't know how to move on. She was my best friend. She knew more about me than anyone else. I could confide in her anything. And she left.

I can't go a day without breaking down because I miss her so much. It hurts. How can I ever be with anyone person? I feel disgusting even thinking about being with another woman. It feels wrong. Horrible. I would do anything to have one more chance, to show her that I have changed. 

I hope she still loves me. I hope she is still in love with me. I am getting by day to day with the hope that one day we can be together again.

I know that logically my thoughts and feelings are irrational and make no sense and in the middle of it I get clear moments where the voice in the back of my head tells me that I’m ME and I am enough but it’s only for a moment and the moment is fleeting. It’s like the thought surfaces and then disappears back into the depths of the abyss that is my stupid mind. My insecurities will eat me alive and only because I let them but how can I not let them when everything I’ve ever known has only shown me that I am not enough and will always be broken and people are self serving so much so that I will be pushed aside and forgotten about and I fucking wish I could believe myself when I say that everything will be OK but I fucking can’t  I can’t and I’m trying so hard but it’s not working.,15Aug2019,1

105,"Hi, this is my first time posting on Reddit, so apologies if I make a mistake. 

I’ve (22F) been dealing with what I would say is pretty severe body dismorphic disorder for a very huge portion of my life. My biggest insecurity has always been my arms, and it seems like it’s pretty much the one thing that triggers my body dismorphia the most (which usually results in me being depressed and having panic attacks, and hiding myself constantly).  Things got worse when I developed an eating disorder in college because of it. I did go to therapy for it, and while it did help a bit, my view of myself is still pretty much the same. 

I know getting surgery done wouldn’t magically make me love my appearance 100%, but I’m just really tired of spending hours of my days every day having breakdowns because of this one thing I’m insecure about.

I’ve been seriously considering having a minor procedure done just so I can feel comfortable in my own skin and live my life in peace, but part of me feels really guilty for considering it. Since there seems to still be a bit of a negative connotation surrounding plastic surgery, I feel like people might look down on me for not “loving myself enough” or something like that.

111,"Since a pretty long time there have been many moments that should be filled with joy and satisfaction, but I only experience those feelings for a very short time and then I just feel empty and not satisfied at all.

To give a few examples:

I am a 20 year old male who recently graduated from a study which was way out of my interests and I hated it so much. I didn't want to waste my time so I decided to keep on going and I graduated while many teachers and students doubted me. Everybody was happy and celebrating while I was not even impressed by myself. It didn't feel special, all I wanted was to be done with the horrible study.

Not much later I turned 20 and again people were all happy and excited for me while I just saw it as another boring day.

I go to some music festivals on the regular and when I'm there I'm having the best time of my life, but the moment I get home I completely lose all the joy that I had at the festivals.

Hanging out with friends is probably the most fun I have lately, it actually makes me sad when it's over because those moments are the very few moments that I can finally chill and have some kind of fun.

At last, I like to play videogames (a lot) and sometimes I'm actually pretty good at them. So whenever I'm high up on the leaderboards I have a short moment of happiness and then it means nothing to me anymore and I just want to get even better. The 95% of the time that I play well does not bring much happiness but that 5% of me doing absolute shit makes me so disappointed and frustrated.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to embrace the joy and actually feel satisfied when I'm supposed to feel satisfied and 'proud'. I've had my parents be all happy and proud of me while I didn't understand what was making them so excited.

I'm pretty clueless and really wish to know what's wrong and if there is something to do against it.

Any advice or help is highly appreciated, thanks a lot.",15Aug2019,1

113,"I was at my parents house, searching for some personal documents, and I came across some sort of doctors report with my sisters name on it. I don’t know why, but I looked at it and I read it. It was right there on the front page. 10 years ago she took an overdose of pills with alcohol. She was 14 at the time. I was 7. 

I’m heartbroken. I literally felt sick when I read it. I remember our childhood being tough, but I never knew she went through this. 

Everything she said to her therapist was in the report. She never went to school, I knew that. But she also told the therapist she did not need school, she hated herself, her life, her future. She was depressed, and spent most days in bed crying. Reading that made me so incredibly sad.

It also made me realize I am extremely proud of her. When she was 16 she went back to high school, and got her diploma. This is also the year she met her current boyfriend. They became friends and started dating soon after. He is such a kind, loving person. My sister is now pregnant with their first child, a boy! Not only that, she’s also finishing her last year at university in september and landed a great job. I think she is very happy. I love her. 

I’m not going to tell anyone I know this, if they wanted me to know, they would tell me. So that’s why I’m sharing it here. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read it.",15Aug2019,14
115,"I havent been able to keep a job since I graduated high school. And its solely for the reason of annoying fact we all have to work 40 hours a week to make more money for the big guys.

Then things will change and I'll get a new part time job enough to pay the bills and live a little.


I just have to power through the rest of this year at my job. Today was one of those days I wanted to throw my headset at my computer screen and scream. I work at a call center and been working in call center environments for the last 3 years. Retail or fast food would just be the cause of death to me but customer service is literally the only skill I have to offer and this is the best job I could land. Customer service is extremely soul sucking and I just need a vacation but cant afford one.


Idk i just needed to vent. Today was hard. And dont get me wrong. Idk if this laziness because I've been working just fine since I was 16, but had a mental down after graduating and things havent been the same ever since. I dont have any friends or hobbies.

117,"I'm only a part time teller at a semi-large bank in a small town. I've worked there for a year this month. However, I'm a fulltime student at a local university going into my last year.

I'm in a good place with my grades and I would not be in financial trouble without this job. I took it because I didnt want to rely on my parents and I wanted to work hard in every way I could. 

However, it had come to the point where I've been bombarded with family and home issues to the point where I had a breakdown at work. I feel like I'm running away if I quit now while another part of me knows I need to focus on what it is that I need to do. 

My mom supports my quitting of this job. I, however, feel hesitant to leave when they're so short staffed. And how do I even write a letter to put in my two weeks? I feel so guilty. I feel like a wimp. 

Tldr: had a breakdown at work. Realized I need to focus on what's important which means quitting my part time job. Family is supportive. Only thing keeping me from doing it is my sense of duty to my coworkers.",15Aug2019,3

First i will type some stuff that will make you think i am smart, then maybe i will get to the main point.


Everyone views something differently and can see same stuff from different angle. You can have different interpretation of the same story.


What is a theme?


According to Mr. Google, In contemporary literary studies, a theme is a central topic a text treats. Themes can be divided into two categories: a work's thematic concept is what readers ""think the work is about"" and its thematic statement being ""what the work says about the subject"". Themes are often distinguished from premises.
Basically theme is an idea or concept that the story treats or talk about in whatever means.


Example :


Title: The broken heroes.

Premise: 5 heroes needs to get the treasure in a very far place that fixes some of their flaws.

Some of its themes: Friendship and teamwork.

Main theme: flaws are what make us humans, so maybe it is ok to have them.


End of the example.


Side note: I am sorry that this is longer than needed. It is because i don't really understand what i am talking about. I am trying to understand by talking about it lol.


If you ask me what is the most important part of a story, then i will tell you that it is the characters and plot, respectfully.

Because it doesn't really matter what the theme or the premise is. What matters is how the story is told.
The most ridiculous and simple premise or theme can be done in a very interesting and good way.
