5,Another day of destroying myself mentally over guilt and my past.  I've finally worn myself down so hard that I can barely think or stay awake and aware enough to continue punishing.

6,"I have studied and studied and studied on this course because my family really thought I could do well in real estate sales and I did too. I struggle so badly with the math parts of the practice exams because I have dyscalculia, it's so frustrating I don't even want to take the extra 25 minutes it takes me to work out ONE problem that I just guesstimate because the anxiety it causes me isn't worth it when I know I'll do perfectly fine on the other questions.

A month or so before I was due to take my final I realized I kind of fucking hate this. It seems so useless to me. I was reading articles from real estate agents who made it very clear that you could go months, even more than a year without a sale, not to mention the money I'd have to put into building up a business for myself, how the hell I would get around to properties without a car, and not to mention being a woman in a not particularly good part of town, having to meet with men I don't know as part of my job, I started to hate the idea of pursuing this and realized I had allowed my family to convince me into something I should have never gotten involved with.

Here is the thing, I took a blood-borne pathogens course and got my tattoo license certification about a year ago. I realized thats the path I'm actually passionate about, but I kept it under wraps and didn't pursue it. Why? 

Family. 

Again.

My family is ultra conservative and believe tattoos are of the devil.

I realized I needed to stop playing into what my family thinks is best for me and just fucking live my life.

It sucks because I already sunk some money into this real estate thing, so I want to finish it regardless. I get one chance to take the final exam. The course says I can retake it in 30 days but the course materials expire in 5 days so, I don't know how thats going to work.

I have been trying to get a good score on the practice exams but I'm just not getting them. You have to pass with an 80%, I've taken it 3 times now and have passed once with an 80, and failed twice with a 59. 6 hours of my day sunk into these stupid practice tests and I'm just ready to take the final and flunk the entire thing. I just want to move forward already.

I originally wanted to pass so I could have the certification of passing the course on the back burner so if I ever wanted to go for my license in the future I could, but I don't know anymore. I'm just stressed out and want to focus on other things. I don't want to invest any more time into this course.",17Dec2019,1

9,"And...basically,she thinks you guys are full of shit.  


Real talk.  


How about you leave things like assessing people's mental states over social media to the professionals(like said shrink.)  


Unless you guys are licensed mental health clinicians,I don't think you're qualified to call me insane.  


But,I can give two possibilities:  


1-Either you just want to be an asshole to me and you go ahead and spout off shit you have NO qualification to do so(again,go to medical school and then call me insane.)  


2-Maybe you guys are just as scared as I am,and you just want to silence me.  


But,all in all:What you guys did...that was one billion kinds of fucked up..like honestly,that hurt.  


Here I am,legitimately afraid ,and you go and play armchair therapist...and you don't even know the first fucking thing about mental illness...way to make people like me feel like shit. And hell of a precedent you set for others who suffer like me.  


Again,please,read up and mental illness..check out folks like NAMI and the like and get educated on this shit.  


For you who want to play armchair doctor is not only hurtful as shit(not to mention fucking rude and uncalled for..it was LEGITIMATE fear...i was never looking for confrontation at all,you ALWAYS had the option to block me/downvote me/ignore me.) but can be fucking **dangerous.**  


Like,just imagine if I was someone else! Thank god I'm seeing a shrink,because if you did this to ANYONE else...I don't want to think about it.  


Honestly,how about learning about what mental illness truly is...it's sure as hell not the shit you see on the big screen.  


Mental illness is far more complex than calling someone ""crazy"",because,as humans,we ALL are a bit crazy.  


I know I have something wrong with me...but the last thing I need is people who are NOT qualified telling ME what I have.  


It's like a bunch of people telling me that there's something wrong with my car...when the only experience they've had with cars is video games...and then a real car mechanic says that you're talking out of your ass.  


TL;DR:Stop calling people crazy. Mental illness is FAR more complex than that. Also,you don't have the qualifications to do so.  And you think I WANT to have my brain epically fuck with me? It's not something that I can exactly turn off.  


Think about that the next time you want to trivialize mental illness and for the love of god,please remember that there is another person on the other side of that computer screen! And also,when you start telling people to get help and all that noise,you just come off as condescending and patronizing.

12,"I'm 20 and wholly independent. I come from a very poor family and never had access to a vehicle. I was too embarrassed to ask any of my friends or friends' parents to teach me in high school, and to be honest I'm a bit scared of driving. But I'm tired of the questions and the judgement that comes with not having a driver's licence, and it's pretty useful to have regardless.

I decided to learn because I mentioned how I felt about it to my ex and he offered to teach me. I started studying for the written test and he would take me to empty parking lots to teach me the hands on stuff. Now I can't help but associate driving with him and it's becoming very triggering. We had what I thought was an amazing relationship before that last month when he decided to cheat on me, and it really hurts to think about. He was one of the only two people in my life that made me feel safe, cared for, and loved.

It's not necessary for me to get my driver's licence right now because I doubt I'll have access to another car anytime soon, but I really want to do this for myself. I've always felt behind my peers and like less of an adult for not having one, which I know aren't the greatest reasons. But I also want that sense of accomplishment I'll get from it.

14,"There's someone who works at the same office as me (not directly with me, thankfully), and I have a huge crush on them. We know each other fairly well outside of work as well, which doesn't really help either.

I'm not used to this at all - I used to think I was asexual or aromantic and have done for the last 6 years of my mid 20s life - and it's just swirling my emotions into a huge mess. It was ok back when I knew they weren't single, it all just sat at the back of my mind and I ignored it, but they broke up with their SO maybe three months ago now and it all just surged back into life.

All I want is to just stop my mind spinning around this one thing for no reason. I want to stop having the back of my mind over analyse everything they do, I want to stop the daydreaming, and stop getting twinges of irrational envy and hope. If I knew there was no chance, that would be enough (I think) to dampen all the rushing emotions.

I have no specific evidence that they have any special interest in me beyond standard colleague/friend level (though at least part of my  brain will happily run in depth analysis trying to prove that wrong!)

Would it be reasonable to just ask someone out even if you don't think they will (on balance) say yes? Is that something that people do? Is that better than just suffering in silence? Would there be long term fallout from that?",17Dec2019,1

18," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence : /",17Dec2019,1
19,"I had a last appointment to get travel expenses for my new job with my job advisor who I'd been going to for 6 months. I'd never really got on with her in recent times as I used to just keep my head down rather than saying hello to her and I always felt she hated me because im ugly and quiet (the  type no advisor wants to bother with) I got a new job and I told my new job that id been in a temporary work placements the last 6 months rathery than being with that advisor the last 6 months as I said (because they didn't want to see too many gaps in unemployment, I lied) and my advisor (who didn't know tbh) contacted my new job to confirm my employment, and then my new manager questioned me about where I actually was the last 6 months ( I nearly got sacked) I emailed my advisor angry about it and her responses were her mad to on the defensive she replied with things like ‘I will not contact you again now if this is what you prefer’ and ‘I’m sorry you are unhappy about this but I do wish you well for the future’ etc. but but I quickly apologised as I realised she didn't know I lied I replied ‘ok sorry to make a fuss’ and she didn’t reply. Then the next day I emailed  her again and asked her could I get a bus pass for the first week of work as I worked a week in hand and apologised again also about my misunderstanding and she replied ‘that’s fine graham, don’t worry, if you want to come in to office ‪before 5pm today‬ I can sort this out for you’. Later that day I  went in to my advisor and I sat there about 10 mins (I thought she’d of wanted rid of me quick tbh?) she asked me about getting to work and how much it usually costs etc. I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was writing the paper form out for the bus pass, so I apologised again she then said 'it's alrigggghht' (but sounded annoyed) I then explained my manager questioned me about it and she seemed surprised and said 'did he?' And then she said 'just we have to contact them to confirm your employment' Then I said 'Its ok I understand' and she went quiet as she written the paper form out for me then just asked when I’m next in (my new job) I said tonight and she said ‘tonight?’ (Idk if she was passing conversation or asking about travel expenses).  A moment later she passed me the form and I stood up to go and said thanks, then she leaned forward slightly sitting down with her hand out and said 'awwwwwwwwwww, awwwww (more like rrrrrrrr) (it was prolonged than what I typed like an gap filler tongue tied I think) and said a few things then I said ok and slowly walked away (out of nervousness) she then said 'let me know if you need anything else' I just said ok and slowly walked away and then she said ' oh..and I'll stay in contact to see how your getting on, I'll contact you by email if that makes things easier for you' and smiled (I mainly Contacted her by email) (she said it all upbeat and bubbly) I said 'oh ok thanks, great' (I'm really shy)she said 'awww ok' then she turned back around sitting on her chair and said 'oh and...(I turned back around again) well done' and smiled and then turned back to her computer. she said well done a lot since I got that job",17Dec2019,1

I didn’t know where to share this, but I thought this was the closest place. 

On a warm moonlit night, two people strolled down down the street. The only sounds were that of their footsteps. The boy carried a bow and arrow. “There are so many, aren’t there? They’re so far away, the stars. If only I could reach up and grab one, and keep it for myself. That would be nice, wouldn’t it?” The girl remarked. “It would, huh? The stars seem far away, but the moon is quite close. See? It’s almost like you could touch it, just by holding up your hand.” The boy replied. “The moon looks beautiful tonight.” He said, gently gripping her shoulder. But she backed up a bit. The breeze turned cold, ripping through the boy’s chest. The girl, however, was warmed by the chest of the dragon that gripped her. A dragon without talons or teeth. The moon turned dark, but she had the light of the stars. Wings flapped, and she ascended, past the moon, into the stars. The boy was alone, wrapped in the dark, now grasping for the light of the stars, knowing he could never reach them. He could only be visited occasionally by the girl, hovering just above his reach, unwittingly tormenting him. She would visit for 6 hours a day for thousands of years. Getting thinner, her eyes more heavy, her hair, at one time brown and lustrous, falling out. “The stars are amazing, you know.” She pushed out her last breath, slumping off the dragon.",17Dec2019,1

It was real.   
But it still doesn’t feel real. None of this feels real. I’m waiting for her to call and say “ey, gotcha! I’m alive!” Or text me back to finish our last text conversation about alpacas. Or post something about hamsters on her social media.

No offense to others but the social media type women just aren’t my type which is fine because I’m most likely not there type but it seems that every girl is like that and it’s becoming difficult to not adjustment my standards because I do want a relationship.

She was wearing her moccasins, her pink dressing gown, her glasses, and her hair was in little grey ringlets. I remember picking her up and cuddling her, and telling her how much I miss her and love her. 

I don't know what triggered this dream, but tomorrow I'll take some flowers out to her grave and spend some time with her. She lived with us for over a year before she passed away. I don't remember a lot about her time with us, but I do miss her presence and knowing that if I wanted to chat, Nan was always there.

I failed every pre req for any schooling related to the medical field (micro, cal 2, and orgo are fs) when my whole extended Asian family expects me to be in this field or engineering. I can’t use a drill effectively, takes me hours to do any simple car maintenance (changing oil, replacing a battery terminal), and I can’t seem to get scripts or commands to work on Linux other than sudo. It took me 4.5 years to graduate when I could have graduated sooner with at least a 3.5 if I gave up pre med in freshman year rather than waiting until I failed calc twice and orgo once. I also wished I had more experiences such as getting a girlfriend, did more community service, or being closer to my friends rather than hunkering down in the library for classes I would fail.

The only person that understands and knows my situation me is best friend since elementary. No one knows my GPA is extremely low other than him. I am not excited for the holidays as I don’t have a confident response to “congrats, what’s next?” Everyone expects me to go into medicine since I was so confident when in truth it was only about money. I feel like a failure right now as I look for jobs in supply chain (a minor I graduated with) or a entry admin job (did some computer work on my free time since middle school) while barely meeting their requirements.

My uncle  - Tony (24yr)

Tony was apart of my life for a long time taking on the father role for me and my brother after my father passed away.
I never thought it was odd that he would take Ricky out every other day to go out for pizza or to play games because i thought he was just a great uncle. He would always buy Ricky gifts like v-bucks and anything else he asked for, i thought it was just him being a good father figure well i thought wrong.

I was visiting him like a would normally 
While Ricky stayed home because he was grounded. Everything was fine and normal 
Night roles around its 11pm im playing league on his laptop hes asleep in the other room
I eventually got bored so i went to go talk on discord, there was no thumbnail so i went into the files to see if it was even installed.
It wasent there but there was a video titled 
""Young 12 year old boy r***d by dad""
And this wasn't roleplay it was an actual kid
I was sick so i took the laptop and my stuff and ran out the house while he was asleep.
I started jogging down the street to get home
My breathing was heavy and my hands were shaky. I was terrified 
What if he woke up and noticed i left
He could be driving looking for me
He owns a gun
My heart was beating really fast and i was crying 
I never felt this amount of fear in my life 
After walking for what felt like an eternity i made it too a local restaurant.

She cares for me. She spends a lot of time with me. She cuddles with me for hours. We kiss to music playing on our phones while we cuddle. We hold hands. She points out how people look at and are jealous of us when we walk holding hands, lol.

62," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

I've been living in another city for two years now. And i have changed so much, its ridiculous. I genuinely found my nerdy/geeky side and started loving to love and get excited about things, so when i got home i got really excited about a little thing (the way lazer printer paper turns black when you heat it with a candle..doesnt matter) and his reaction was something in the way of ""damn youre crazy"" (in German ""du hast schon ein bisschen nen vogel ha?"" Which..kinda puts the thing down since it can be seen as a random thing to say (which is how he meant it), but it has negative connotations)

And i know it wasnt meant like..negatively..he just cant say ""thats really cool"" or something, so he tries to engage in a way..but not in a positive way, because he doesnt do that. The best thing he can muster is ""damn youre crazy""..

And i realised that that is the reason i am the way i am, the reason why i needed so much time away from home to find myself and find out that i actually do like things and CAN get really excited about stuff..because that is the way i am, but being put down for stuff like that (again..not on purpose) since you're a child just makes you..not be that way..

I thought it was just a coincidence, but each day following, he waits until I’m in my car and pulling out before he leaves. I talked to him the other day, and my mom told him, “she leaves so early now! Have you seen her leave? The way she reverses?” He said, “yeah, I see her every morning.” We don’t live in a safe neighborhood and I can tell he’s waiting for me to safely leave the house so he can, too. It’s very dark and our driveway light has been out for a few months. Sometimes I’ll sit idly in the car and see if he’ll take off before me, but he hasn’t.

87,"It’s scary how when you have a crush on someone. Attraction can alter your brain in changing yourself without realizing. You only see them with rose tinted lenses. When they say something funny when it’s not even funny at the slightest, you think it’s the most funniest thing ever. But when someone else says the exact same joke, you just think how pathetic and unfunny that joke is. You start making up inside jokes with them, which is inside jokes about your friends, only because it makes them laugh so hard. All because you want to see them smile and hear their infectious laugh. You automatically start liking the same stuff as them, even though beforehand you didn’t like it. You start creating your playlist on Spotify, which is the songs they enjoy and when you listen to the playlist you’re imagining yourself with them at romantic spot cuddling each other watching the sunset. All you can think about 24/7 is being in a relationship with them, you think how they’re your soulmate. They are your first thought when you wake up and your last thought when you’re about to fall asleep. Your dreams are even about them, you think it’s because you’re destined for them. When they talk to you, all you think of is how beautiful they are, how soft and harmonious their voice is, basically how perfect they are. They’re like an angel sent to earth, they’re rare like a gem. When they are paying interest to you, it makes you feel special and you stare right in their kaleidoscope eyes, while your heart beats like a ticking time bomb, your palms begins to sweat and you try to cover your face because you know you’re blushing. You think they are your only hope in your life. Every time you’re with them, they some how get even more attractive, even you find their mannerisms adorable. You created a relationship with them in your mind, wishing it could come to fruition. The relationship with them in your mind becomes so real, that you tell them personal stuff about yourself and your thoughts to them.



Once you take off your rose tinted lenses, you see their true colors. You start to see how they are really are like. You realise how annoying they are. Their voice sounds like nails scratching a blackboard. When you listen to your playlist that you created, you hate the songs because it reminds you of when you had intense feelings for them. You realise how pathetic the songs are and how it’s not even the music you actually like. When they say something funny, you realise how unfunny and cringe it was. You look back wondering why you found them funny at the slightest. Every time you see them, the less attractive they are. Their mannerisms you found adorable, you just don’t even find it adorable anymore. When they tell the inside jokes about your friends you made with them, you become extremely offended and mad because they are mocking your friends. But you realise you’re the one who made those jokes because you were so attracted to them, that your mind thought it was okay to make jokes about your friends because it made your crush laugh. When you hear them laugh, they sound like a horse having an asthma attack. Your dreams are no longer about them, instead you forget about the dreams you have. They are no longer in your mind anymore, it’s like they have literally died in your mind. Your heart no longer beats fast when you’re near them and miraculously your palms don’t sweat anymore and you don’t feel like your blushing when they talk to you. When you look into their eyes, they are no longer kaleidoscope. You think to yourself why you even did those things when they were talking to you and you think you were so stupid for having such physical reactions when they were talking to you. You think to yourself how pathetic you were when you thought they were your only hope in life. Also, you get shocked on how many personal things you have told them about yourself and your thoughts to them. You realise that you are the polar opposite to them and basically tried to like the exact same stuff as them, so they could like you back.",17Dec2019,1

Well this is because I only work a couple of days of the week, and people seem to love to ask ‘oh, so what do you do on your days off?’ It just feels so judgmental specially when I say not much really they’ll be like ‘oh’.

96,"There's really not much of a platform for girls who suffer from porn addiction here on reddit. If you post on any sites catered to that 10/10 you will have some nice guy messaging you then one day he will send you a picture of his dick. Also using this account so you know who you're are. 

Porn addiction for men and women is different, men get boners they have to care of women don't. I personally find it difficult to relate to men and their porn addiction because it's just not the same. I don't watch porn to get rid of an erection, I watch porn because I am bored, lonely or when I want to learn something. Mostly because I am lonely. Maybe that's something common between us. I don't follow the whole NoFap movement for the same reason. 

There have been many times throughout my addiction where I have gone through months or years without watching any porn. It wasn't until the discovery of how to masturbate until I orgasm that I lost a bit of self control. The longest I have gone without porn since then is only a few months and when deeply controlled by addiction I will pmo more than five times a day. 

This year I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and learnt that it affects the chemical imbalance in my brain and I hunger for more of the happy chemical you get from having orgasm than most people. 

Because of this I came to the conclusion that maybe actual sex with actual men will help me with my addiction. So I started meeting up with guys off reddit for oral sex, it helped as I wasn't watching porn all day or night because I was chatting up and meeting up with these men. Honestly didn't work because I chose men who were also virgins like me, for safety reasons, and they didn't know what they were doing. So I have had my share of the hooking up culture and it's honestly not my cup of tea. 

Haven't watched an actual porn in weeks now but unsure where I am headed in all of this.",17Dec2019,1
97,"Mitch and Lindsey are publicly saying they won’t be impartial (and in effect desperately pleading to get tossed from the trial altogether, like they know any juror would be in any other trial).  

Both Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham are attorneys. Mitch McConnell in fact used to be a judge. This training, knowledge, and clear understanding of the law has put them in a tight spot.

On the one hand they want to stay on Trump’s good side, on the other hand, they know the law and understand that Trump has clearly violated it. 

They know their vote will go down in history as a vote to agree that a President can abuse his power and barter US funds or action for personal gain.  

Because they are trained lawyers, they think they found a way out of their corner and so now they are out here telling the world that they are not going to be impartial in this trial.  Their experience and training in the law tells them that this should disqualify them from serving as jurors and somebody should remove them from having to vote and be on the record for setting this precedent. They think they have found a win-win.  Getting removed from the trial, staying on the right side of Trump, and the Democrats will have two less Republicans to worry about. Most importantly, this will save them from going down in history as trained lawyers and Christians, who swore before God and on the Bible to uphold the law, but then chose the interests of a man over an oath to God. 

But no one is willing to give them that easy out. Instead they are forcing them to cast their vote. 

So now Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, two very principled men, face a question that they are very capable of answering based on their law school degrees and training. I’m a lawyer and every lawyer I know sees that the law makes it clear he should be impeached.  The law is intended to be the great equalizer. Whether you like someone or not. Rich or poor. Powerful or not. If you break the law, those factors are not intended to bear on the outcome and the law should stand alone as the scale of justice.  Juries often get this wrong because they base their opinions on feelings of a person...but McConnell and Graham two attorneys are no regular jury, they have been trained in the law and understand clearly how it is to be interpreted. 

So now the time has come where these two highly intelligent men, trained in the law, former attorneys and a judge, know clearly that the  Constitution holds the current articles of impeachment brought forth by the House as grounds for voting yes on impeachment, and the day is approaching for them to swear to God Himself, with their hand on that Bible...",17Dec2019,1

102,"  

Please excuse my bad English :p 

I have never felt like I did this past 4 weeks. It was very interesting, to watch all my anxieties and awful feelings of despair disappear and leave me have some good night sleep. 

The mindfulness that I achieved lately was certainly remarkable. It kept me in a state of self-awareness where a lots of mysterious feelings I had before were now clear. 

Comparing yourself to your peers does sometimes have some advantages. Specially, if it is done in a healthy and emphatic way. 

I must say that this following experience that led me to some very beautiful results, wasn’t expected nor intended. Could that be one of the factors that made me see things differently ? maybe.

Anyways…

Like any other day, that day I was feeling this strange feeling in my stomach, a feeling that I’ve been very familiar with through my adult and childhood life. It has always been there, a mixt of undefined feelings, varying from a negligible sense of stress to an uncontrolled volcanic explosion of multiple feelings merging together, creating this  very tense suffocating feeling. I could always distinguish between it layers of agitated feelings  huge proportions of anger and fear. 

What was always surprising, is the unexpected surging of this gut feeling. I remember trying to understand  the relation between the space/time that I was living in and the occurrence of this later, but I just never did. (sometimes, a day can be as normal as any other day and I would find myself aching inside hopelessly with this stomach ache)

I could be having a great day with some friends, lots of laughs and fun and out of nowhere the feeling shows up.  There was no noticeable pattern to it appearance. 

That day, the day where my perspective of things kind of changed, was one of the worst ones. I came back from work and I was feeling all the weight of the world laying on my shoulders. I could notice my colleagues and friends spotting the fake smile I was putting on and my low energy. I opened the door of my house, and with a big smile my roommate welcomed me. I returned his great excitement for seeing me, with a cold smile that felt so hard to put out. In a blink of an eye, he noticed this low energy, what he would call later “negative energy” bursting out of me. 

As always, he tried to lift my spirit with some of his lame funny jokes but, unfortunately for me, it didn’t work. I passed him directly to my room, changed my cloths and put my self into my bed. It was only 8am (I was that desperate). My rooting of self-pity was starting and obviously I preferred to go through it by myself. 

It was the same routing I go through whenever I would feel this way. I would cover myself, order a fatty fast food and look up for a movie/series in Netflix that I have probably watched a dozens of times. Usually, I watch my favorite series “friends”. The background laughs would sooth me to an extent. I could stay in my bed in this state for hours. The routine usually ends with more self-pity and hopelessness. It never made feel better about myself, I did it anyways. 

But that day was different, before I could get to my bed, my roommate opened the door and told me straight into my face, with a sadness and disappointment in his face that I never seen before, that whenever I acted this way it reminded him of this common friend of ours. (Without going into details, I hated being around this friend and I would always say to my roommate that this person makes me feel very anxious, stressed and not good about myself) 

this announcement was very shocking, felt like a punch in the face. I was clearly surprised. I followed him into his room asking him to explain what he meant with that. (I  obviously understood what he meant but I guess needed to hear it from him).

He explained, what you readers know already, that I complain frequently and only see the bad side of every story which eventually generates this huge grey cloud of self-destructive thoughts. The shadow of this cloud not only diminishes my energy and my desire of a having a good time, but also of those who are around me. he followed that by calling me a very selfish person, since all I thought about was my self and not about those who surrounded me.

I agreed with him profoundly and what shocked me more is how I never in my life understood this mindfully. I mean, in a way I did acknowledge all what he said but I just never…felt/understood it.

Long story short, for the next 4 weeks after that conversation with my roommate, I felt tremendously great. I would find my self smiling for no reason, talking to people became more easy, I slept better…everything worked just great.  I thought I would never go back to that miserable state of mind, I thought that I figured it out, but as you guessed it, I didn’t understood it fully and the feelings eventually came back knocking on my doors. 

These past couple of days have been tough. I hardly can wake up in the morning and I find myself loosing my focus and having  low productivity during work, which makes things even worst. 

Out of panic, fearing the surge of those gut eating feelings,  I decided to write my thoughts down hoping it clears my mind and surprisingly it is working. I am feeling more calm and clear headed 😊 😊.

Is there anyone out there that relates to this ? do you have any tips/advice to overcome this weird feelings FOREVER ?",17Dec2019,1
103,"For the longest time after living an incredibly selfish life, I became completely depressed. Many things factored into this depression. My world view was grim. I hated the state of humanity.

Yes, I know I shouldn't have done it and I deserve to feel bad about it. I do. But at this point of time I left and waited at the street trying to get an uber home and burst into tears. I'm super lonely where I live, moving to this country with barely any friends and spending my weekends alone. Work was a safe space with fun people who liked me, and drunk me realised I'd fucked this up and I'd get even lonelier now since everyone would hate me for being the homewrecler drunk. 
 
I got home eventually and things have been fine at work since. Today I actually got an amazing job offer in a different country that I'm over the moon about and I've started to think that there's a lot to look forward to next year. Maybe I have a shot at being less lonely. At the very least, I'll be with some old friends and making a lot more money.  
 
I just got a message request on Facebook from some guy I don't know. I opened it up and it's someone I don't remember meeting when I was crying trying to get an Uber. He said he knew it sounded weird and I gave him my name and he just wanted to make sure that I got home OK and that I was doing OK because the way I described things were ""pessimistic"". I can't remember the conversation but I bet I was a pathetic mess. He also said he feels bad for leaving me when his Uber arrived and that he'd understand if I just want to forget it all and ignore his message.  
 
It means so much to me that he reached out to a complete stranger to check in on her. I've set a reminder to reply and thank him tomorrow, but GOD, its heartwarming to see a message like that.
