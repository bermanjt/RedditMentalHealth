0,"This happened a couple weeks ago and it's still popping into my head. 

I have a lot of social issues. To sum that up, I assume people automatically think the worst of me on sight and in turn I have zero social confidence. My brain often just freezes up in social situations too, especially restaurants where there's just a sensory overload. So when I was at Starbucks for the first time last week and ordered an iced Frappuccino without even realizing there are flavors, it honestly meant a lot that the barista was super friendly and listed them off for me like it was nothing. I started to panic when she asked what flavor, then I apologized and asked what flavors there are. Maybe she does that a hundred times a day and was secretly wishing dumbasses like me would read the menu more closely, but she didn't act that way at all and it's interactions like that that keep me from locking myself in my house and never coming out. And I was frustrated with myself for a moment because I did read the menu for like five minutes and apparently just overlooked the whole flavor section, and it was RIGHT THERE but the barista made me feel like less of a dumbass.

And yes, I realize it's basically part of her job to not be an ass to customers but I *have* had other cashiers act like they loathed the fact I was there for no apparent reason, so...yeah. Shoutout to all of you customer service/fast food workers and huge thanks to those of you who are patient with us socially crippled folks!",09Nov2019,1
1,"I've been alone for so long. Lost a lot of friends in my teens because of disagreements, made new ones but the contact just... stopped.

Ever since I've been a social recluse, moved out on my own, spend most days alone. I thought I was an introvert, but I'm not. I miss having friends who I can meet and talk to every now and again.

I started creating myself a fantasy in my head, where I had a lot of friends and a loving boyfriend. This version of me has the life I want, but just don't know how to get anymore. Everything is extremely detailed, down to the occupations and relationships of my imaginary friends.

It wasn't bad at first, just daydreaming. I would say it was me coping with the loneliness I was subconsciously aware of. Then it slowly took over all of my life. I kept thinking about this fictional life everywhere I went. I still do.

Now after a few years though, I'm beginning to realise how utterly alone I am in reality. None of the people I love are real. And that breaks my heart because I don't have anything like that in reality.

19,"In late August I started talking to some guy and we hit it off. Buuuut we didn‚Äôt get very far into our ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù (I use that term very loosely) before I ended it saying I wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship. We both liked each other as people and the end of it was friendly so we kept following each other on social media.

He hit me up not long after trying to sext me. I told him we could have a strictly sexual relationship if he wanted, or we could be friends. Not both. He said he wanted to be friends and didn‚Äôt want sex, only sexting. I said no. I told him to stop sexting me and we could be friends.

He didn‚Äôt stop sexting me. Most of the time I wouldn‚Äôt sext him back but also wouldn‚Äôt tell him to stop because I knew he would pull some shit like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry I feel so bad‚Äù which would then make me feel bad. But I did remind him a couple times that I didn‚Äôt want him to sext me.

Throughout the last couple of months I‚Äôve tried to be friends. I‚Äôve tried to chat about our lives multiple times, tried to invite him to lunch one day, etc. only to be rejected. I eventually gave up on trying to talk to be friends. 

Then on Tuesday I was already upset and crying about unrelated stuff and he said ‚Äúhey. I‚Äôm really horny‚Äù and I said ‚Äúgood for you‚Äù and he said ‚Äúyou wanna see?‚Äù Normally when he says that he sends me a picture before I can even say no, but this time I went OFF. I honestly don‚Äôt even remember what I said but I went off on him like I‚Äôve never gone off on anyone before. He felt horrible. I deleted him on all social media while he profusely apologized and I refused to let him weasel his way back into ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù with me.

For once in my life, I don‚Äôt feel terrible about making someone feel bad. I finally realize that you know what, he SHOULD feel bad. He continually tried to use me for pleasure when I told him multiple times I didn‚Äôt want to. He rejected me as a friend multiple times all the while telling me he still wanted to be friends. I spent months feeling rejected and used and I FINALLY said something. It‚Äôs a huge relief.",09Nov2019,1
20,"My life has been up and downs. I was never really that happy, but I was doing fine, even though my self-esteem was nonexistent and I rarely had friends. My life changed last Christmas, when I met someone I would go on and date for half a year. I was really happy and for the first time in my life I felt like I could really 100% trust someone. Then it suddenly stopped one day, from the one second to the other. She went from 'love you so much' to 'yeah I'm breaking up' in around an hour. That was devastating, but at the same time I made a really good friend that would save my life over the next 4 months. We hung out almost every day until school started, and we always went to a tcg store on Fridays where we would play yugioh. On one evening we had a stupid argument about something, and from then on the relationship just felt so distanced. That hurt a lot and was a huge step backwards, but I was willing to fight now, and to become happy again. After a month I asked her what had happened and why she distanced herself, to which she replied that there was that one Friday where I promised her brother to bring her home and where I just left without saying anything, and that this in addition to that argument just made her lose the ability to trust in me. 
Now to my point. That one night where I just left I felt really down. I was about to jump off a bridge if not some random passenger would have stopped me and talked to me for an hour. You might ask why I didn't talk to her that day, but she was playing and she seemed really happy that day and I didn't want to ruin that for her, plus I forgot that I promised her brother I'd bring her home. Her telling me that that was one of the reasons she distanced herself from me made me angry. Not at her, or anyone, but at me. For the first time in my life I actually hated me, despised me. I didn't want to die because I couldn't take it anymore. I wanted to die because I wanted to kill me. Nobody has ever ruined my life as much as I did. You could argue that it wasn't *me*, but my depression and anxieties, but they are part of *me*. They are *me*. That was two days ago and I didn't go to school since.

24,"My post got removed from TIFU so i decided i would post it here

 I do not advise doing this but if you choose to do so i had nothing to do with your decision making process, moving on.

People  have house warming parties to warm the house with love and shit, on the  other hand we had house burning parties for when we were moving out.  Basically our idea is that we already had a house warming party so the  place was warm. Now because we are moving out we need to let the love  burn in hell. We had countless shenanigans but it was the one at the  very end that matters. We were going to ""pop a toilet"" you might have an  idea of what that is, and you are probably dead wrong. Popping a toilet  is fairly simple, all you need is a lot of toilet paper a lighter and  protection. Lets start with the important part, the protection now we  had an old cast iron tub in the bathroom. What we did is we got a  mattress screwed a piece of plywood to it so we can use it like a hatch.  The plan was we start the toilet popping process and I would jump in  the tub place the mattress over me and pull ""the detonation string"" and  the toilet would fucking explode. Where some did this with firecrackers  that was not good enough I mean this was a final farewell to the house.  The steps to successful toilet popping are as follows. First you have to  put a ton of toilet paper in the toilet to remove all the water from  the bowl. Then after you have removed all the water remove the soggy  toilet paper. After that you need to put in a lot more toilet paper, dry  of course. Now before the next step you need to tie a string to the  toilets' handle, you can do this at any point but needs to be done  before the next step. This is where the fun begins you light the toilet  paper in the bowl on fire. Your friends need to leave the bathroom and  should at least be 5 feet away from the bathroom. Finally after about 30  seconds to a minute of the toilet burning you hop in the tub and bunker  down with the mattress covering the opening. You pull the string to  flush the toilet and BANG toilet obliterated, no Taco Bell required.

Now  note that is how it is supposed to go. We do these steps the toilet  explodes without a hitch going off. I remove the mattress and sit up.  There is porcelain daggers about 3 to 4 inches long stuck in the walls. I  look back at the mattress and there is a piece of the lip of the bowl  through the mattress. This one about 7 or 8 inches big, it went through  the mattress then through the plywood then stopped. It stopped about 3  inches away from where the center of my chest was in the tub.

NOTE:  I do not recommend you do this this has proven to be potentially fatal  we are just a bunch of dumb asses who did it and i know it is an  absolute cunt move to who ever moves in to that house next.

Edit: grammar

TL;DR I nearly died from exploding my toilet during a house burning party.",09Nov2019,1
25,"So we have this kettle at home, which we use all day, every day cause I drink more tea than the queen of England.

So ofcourse my husband doesn't believe me and is mocking me for not knowing how to push a button on a kettle.

This morning, I tried to turn it on 5 consecutive times and it turned itself off after a few seconds. I thought, lemme grab my phone real quick.

26,"Inspired by the AskReddit thread about guys missing girls' hints.

1. I was 11. A set of 12-year-old triplet girls at the local park was messing with me, and then one of them asked me if I would ""like to make a baby"". I went back to my house after that.
2. I was 14. A girl found out I liked her. The next day, she said hi to me in the hall (I was on my way to the bathroom with hot dog diarrhea), a week later, she signed my yearbook with a heart, and then at the graduation dance, I was walking near her, and she hugged me.
3. I was 15. A 16-year-old girl asked me to massage her back. I didn't, since she had a boyfriend at the time.
4. I was 16. A 16-year-old girl told me to message her on Facebook. I didn't, since I couldn't think of any cool topics to message her about.
5. I was 17, at a football game. There were 2 girls there. One of them put a hotdog into her mouth, asked me to take a selfie with her, then the other asked me ""are you gonna j-ck off to the picture of \[girl's name\] eating the hotdog"". I stammered incoherently because I was caught off-guard. They then kissed me on the cheeks.
6. A couple days later, the girl who had asked me about j-cking off sent me a picture of the girl who had eaten the hot dog on snapchat, captioned, ""she wants to suck your p-nis"". I snapped back a thumbs up that was captioned ""nice"".
7. A few days after that, I had a huge snapchat story, and the girl who had asked me about j-cking off said ""that story was almost as long as your p-nis"". I said ""yes, it was""
8. At the end of the year, when I was 18, a girl (18F) told me, out of the blue, that she wanted to ""keep in touch"", and then later that summer, when I posted a shirtless picture of me scowling at a fake bear head, she messaged me that ""it was a scary picture""
9. At the graduation party a few weeks later, a girl (18F) asked me for my snapchat, and then she smiled at me whenever she passed me. She followed me on insta, and liked all of my posts, and then I posted a joke about marriage to raise awareness for breast cancer, and a dude tagged in in the comments.",09Nov2019,1

36,"I met a girl online who lived in a small town in Brazil. After 3 months of almost daily talking we finally met. I was on vacation and meeting her in person was the best part of it. At first we planned to keep things casual, but by the end of the trip both realized it gone far beyond and that we've got feelings towards each other. 

I returned back home. We kept talking and planned to meet again. As a matter of fact, I managed to find a way to come back to Brazil for over 3 months this time, exactly one month after my departure. She was genuinely very happy to hear this and invited to stay at her place for a couple days, because the apartment I intended to rent would be ready in a week following my arrival. 

Comes the day X, I board the plane to Brazil. My guts tell me something‚Äôs wrong, regardless of daily talks, laughs and all that jazz. Even though I‚Äôve double checked a hundred times whether she was okay with me staying at her place, I felt it's not gonna work well.  ‚ÄúI have a bad feeling about this‚Äù - Hahn Solo. 

When I finally reached her house and saw her, I didn‚Äôt recognize the girl I've known before. From the very first moment she became was cold towards me and her attitude and body language indicated she was not happy to see me . She had school that night which usually ended by 9 pm. But this time she returned home almost at midnight, said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too tired‚Äù and fell asleep. 

The next morning we had a talk. She explained she doesn‚Äôt feel anything anymore, that things she liked about me then irritate her now. Even confirmed she was hanging out with friends after classes because she completely forgot about me and was very upset upon returning home to see me there. She even said when I left the house to get groceries, she felt so good for being alone there.

Needless to say that having heard all that, I was confused and felt like shit. Like a 15 yo kid who chased and was fooled by a girl. I immediately arranged my move out from her place to a different city. Thankfully a couple other friends helped me out. 

The thing though, I can‚Äôt get this girl out of my head. Being with her that previous trip left such an impression, a picture of Brazil, that it‚Äôs like she is irreplaceable now. 

Honestly, I feel so f\*\*\*\*d-up and dumb for not listening to inner voice and coming to stay at her place, for closing eyes on her disrespectful behaviour and for torturing my brain with questions likes ""what did I do wrong?"". It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm back in high school drama, but can‚Äôt do anything about it. 

So here I am. Brazil is nice: people are friendly, drinks affordable, and tinder is booming. But none of it can replace the girl. I even feel like changing flights to go home earlier. 

No logic in this, but feeling like complete shit cuz of what‚Äôs happened. Don‚Äôt know what to do. My brain tells me to forget and to keep going, to disregard her completely, but damn it, the whole place seems to be associated with her. Regardless of all fun times and other girls, she's still deep in my head.

39,"Sorry about how long this is, I tried to keep it brief without leaving too much out.

About three months ago I had to make a very expensive trip across the country to my mother's home to euthanize my fifteen year old cat [Sassafras.](http://imgur.com/gallery/UtPYyWT) I moved two years ago and wanted to bring my cat with me, but my mom and older sister protested, saying that it would be cruel for me to remove her from her home, and that she would be better off staying there. They also promised to take her to the vet as I requested. So even though it was difficult, I moved and left her in their care...

Over the months I tried getting my mom to accept money and to make an appointment for my cat to be seen by a vet (my kitty had an ongoing eye condition that required medicated eyedrops and yearly eye exams), but my mother would refuse and then ignore me until I would stop asking about it. Early July of this year, my mother texts me asking for the local vet clinic's phone number. She said she was a little worried about my cat because she was barely eating, and was sleeping a lot. I gave her the number, and asked her to keep me updated. A week goes by and I haven't heard from her. I ended up hounding her and telling her she needed to make an appointment and to stop ignoring me when I was trying to talk to her about important things. It of course erupted into a big argument, and she pretty much told me (among other upsetting things) that she wasn't going to take my cat to see a vet and I needed to stop asking. I told her it wasn't up for debate (especially after she had promised and two years had passed), she would either do it, or I was coming out there to do it myself. As my first paragraph states, I had to make that trip.

Because my mom would not cooperate, my options were that my cat would either be healthy enough to travel back home with me, or she wouldn't. Results from the vet were that her eye condition was pretty bad, but luckily still treatable with her usual prescription. She had a pretty severe heart murmur, and was going through the stages of kidney failure. Which meant that I would have to euthanize at some point anyways. After a previous experience with kidney failure, I knew that even if things are good now, it can drastically change at any time. Because of the severity of those two conditions I decided to euthanize before things got worse for her. But even trying to keep her from that kind of pain, I know she had suffered greatly, and that she died scared and in pain. Despite having her tranquilized beforehand.

I think I handled the situation as best as was possible, but the whole thing haunts me. The thoughts and feelings will randomly hit me. I am so full of heartbreak, regret and guilt. There are little details that swim around in my head that just make the daggers in my heart go deeper and hurt more. My sweet girl deserved so much better than that...

One thing that frequently pops up in my reading on fitness and balanced diets is the ratio of protein, carbs, and fat in each meal.

There are percentages in some breakdowns (like more than a third of two of them for strength, other variations for weight loss, etc.), but how would I translate them to a meal? Do I go off of total calories and which items contribute in part? Should I measure the grams of each item‚Äîand is there a 'target total' for that?

I like taking baths with bath bombs and candles, like scented lotions, take care of my skin, shave my body hair (I want to shave my legs but would never. It's so much more practical but according to our society a man would never), am really particular about my hair, what products I use in it, how I style it etc. As we speak I'm taking a bath with a lavender bath bomb I bought, drinking wine and listening to. Taylor Swift's new album (which I LOVE). There's almost nobody I'd ever tell about this.



Almost all of my friends (all but 2, one of which is nonbinary) are girls and people might think that's weird too. I just usually feel like they're easier to relate too. I don't like sports, cars, guns or whatever other things men stereotypically like. I can't usually make smalltalk with men but it's pretty easy with women.



Possibly the biggest thing is crying. I fight with depression and I cry sometimes. I think it's healthy. But even  in a situation where crying is really understandable I'd practically rather die than let any male see my cry. Even when I was in the 9/11 memorial I held in my tears until I could get to a bathroom and cried in a bathroom stall so nobody would see me.



And no, I'm not denying any other sexuality. I'm pretty confidently heterosexual, I just like/do these things. I think it should be ok for me to express what I really like without people making assumptions about my identity but I can't. Or at least I feel like I can't. Whenever I talk about this people tend to just think I'm denying being gay, bisexual etc. but that has nothing to do with it.



I don't know what this is! I hate that I can't express myself. I even feel like I can't dress how I want to because dressing well for men unless you're rich means you're feminine as far as most people see it. You either wear Armani suits and a Rolex or stained Walmart cargo shorts if you wanna seem like a man. I'm just almost always thinking about how people are perceiving me and if I'm seeming masculine enough. I can't just go out in public or talk to anyone and be myself. It's never that simple for me.

58,"Warning : this will be a long post : no tlDR at the end.

I'm 40 year old, married, with a 5 year old son.
I'm beginning to sum all the pieces of a puzzle that I haven't been able to solve for the past 20 years : I may be Asperger and never realized it.

But let me begin backwards.

My son has been officially diagnosed recently as Asperger : he is extremely competent in language and reading , and is beginning to have trouble at school (he is bored to death, and is starting to tell us he is ""different"" from the rest of the kids)

We have been knowing that our son is different since the age of 2, and my wife has been suspecting Asperger for a while.
It has not been until this year that we got an official diagnosis.

And suddenly, my life is upside down:  It's like I have gotten a ginormous enlightenment and I'm starting to accept that I may be an Asperger too, as well as my mother, and probably my grandfather.

My brain is starting to put pieces of a giant puzzle together, each day, and everything matches ... from memories I had buried, from major points in my life , everything turns out to the same thing : I have been an Asperger all of my life. Nobody knew, nobody helped me.

My parents where clueless, as what happened to me : I became sick at 14, for no particular reason, for almost 2 years, and as my personality was getting stronger, the worse it got.

It was anxiety, but again, nobody knew, and nobody helped me.

So I began my adulthood as an extremely anxious person, without being diagnosed as such. 

It was only 15 years later when the accumulated anxiety exploded, leading to a clinical condition, that led me to a sick leave, and a major change in my work career. Fortunately, with the help of my wife and my brother, I started to seek for professional help, and began treatment for Anxiety disorder for almost 3 years.

It took me a lot of effort and pain to overcome that, But I did it. I got rid of the growing monster after decades. I was cured. I made peace with myself. Everything was fine.

Or so I thought.

Then my son was born.
And soon we realized that he was different.
My wife suspected Asperger, and told me that maybe I was too.
I always denied it. It was too soon to know. I had prejudices. Autism? No way. Also, me? I'm a grown man, fully functional, no way. Everything is fine!

Since 1 week ago, nothing changed in my mind.

But when we got my son's diagnostic and a specific event happened at home, I suddenly had this enlightenment: yes, my son is exactly the same as I was at his age.

And suddenly, I have began to understand the source of my anxiety. I was cured from it, but I never had the courage, the strength or the energy to dig into the cause of my anxiety. My official explanation was that I was too perfectionist and that I had higher expectations about life that where not met.

I 
WAS
WRONG

All the time.

My anxiety came from the fact that I unconsciously tried every minute of my life to be like the others. I wanted not to be ""the weird guy"". I was not ever myself. And being in this constant tension, for years and decades, brought me to a state of anxiety that almost killed me.

After overcoming the anxiety, I never realized that my true self would be the cause of it.

And now, for the first time I can accept the fact that, even if I am a ""fully functional"" individual, as my psychiatrist put it, I don't have to go against my true nature if I don't want to. I just can begin to accept who I am, with my strengths, and weaknesses, same as everybody else.

And right now, my biggest challenge will be to support my son, so he doesn't have to go through what I have been for more than two decades.

I don't blame my parents. My mother (rest in peace) was 99% of chances to be an Asperger herself , and society back then didn't have the sensibility to identify Asperger as clearly as we can today. She died without knowing.

So, today, I can start to be myself for the first time in my life, and will make the impossible to help my son grow to be himself, no matter what.

When I try to relax I feel very guilty and even start skipping parts of the show I am watching to finish the episodes and go study.

I am studying right now but I feel very restless..I keep on moving my legs so much. I feel so impatient as if I am waiting for this study session to end but I just started 10 minutes ago.

77,"Let me tell you this in phases of life so you understand my situation more clearly.

School life: I was really a shy guy(Fat and short).Maybe because since the start I had this feeling that people are judging me or joking on me. Never got to communicate because I feared people would be offended. So Turned into CLASS CLOWN.( used to love seeing people laughing at my jokes and used to think they liked this personality) Never had a real conversation because of this. I was very awkward to talk to girls. Tried on some, got replies like ‚Äú see your face‚Äù . People only used used to invite me for fun and not serious convos. So I was never really aware of the real talk. Thus never knew how to show my true emotions. Used to bottle them. Had a big brother who was rude to me and many times had said to me ‚Äú why don‚Äôt you just die‚Äù.  Because of all this I became unconfident, insecure, depressed( didnt knew back then, now I know after 7-8 years).You could Imagine my self-esteem from this.

College life till 2018:  1)was the same guy in college with slow self-esteem. Liked a girl in first year. I thought she was the one and we could get close. She started dating another guy. That shit broke my heart.
  I became fully depressed. Developed social anxiety.  Used to sleep for hours after college. Ruined most my connections. Self esteem touched zero.
2) somewhere near the end of college. A girl fell in love with me. We used to talk and it was obvious from both sides. BUT because of my past and the person I was, I didnt get to express my emotion,I was awkward and unconfident( I was still in that depression phase) she sensed this and dated another guy. I lost a precious person because of my inability to be normal person and express my feeling and be less awkward and responsible man.


After 2018: 1) I realised I had social anxiety. I overcame it by constantly taking small steps to communicate
2) I started gym and have worked on my self-esteem and became a little confident from zero confident
3)I no longer have feelings of self-pity
4) communicated with my brother. We have a good relation now

Now: 
GOALS
1) I was a very unconfident guy since school, so I am yet to make a rigid structure of who I am as a person
2) I still stumble upon properly communicating my feeling. I AM working on that
3) I have still developed my damaged self-esteem yet
4) 5-6 years of depressed phase has made me unproductive, lazy( I still sleep a lot) but I am working on it, trying to defeat it.
5) still shyness is present but I am trying to let go of the thinking That I need to impress people and care what they think of me. Now Only thing that matters that How I see myself.
6) practicing self-care. Never bought clothes for myself because of insecurity. I am in shape now


I have still more to discover but I believe that I am transforming into the greatest person I was supposed to be.

88,"It‚Äôs fascinating how much of a strong filter that heartbreak can have on your life. What was beautiful and perfect and colorful yesterday or last week or last year is now dull and empty and meaningless and ugly to look at.

Heartbreak is powerful. And at some point, it stops becoming an emotion, a feeling, *a phase that you‚Äôre just going through right now*.

Instead, it becomes like a gas that fills up your entire body. There‚Äôs no end in sight. It always seems to be expanding. Getting stronger. Filling up the space in your veins and your stomach and your head.

You wake up with it, you go to bed with it, and in the hours in-between that you have to fill, it‚Äôs your constant companion. Sitting with you when you drink your coffee in the morning. Vibrating behind your eyelids while you‚Äôre sitting at work trying not to cry. Tapping on your brain every time you try to open a book to get away from it, just for a second.

Heartbreak, when it‚Äôs strong and severely crippling, can take on a life form you‚Äôve never seen before. It affects the way you look at the world, it affects the way that you have fun, it seeps into the light moments that you try to have with your friends and reminds you that, no, laughter is not something that belongs in your life right now. You should be sad.

You‚Äôre mourning right now. It‚Äôs absolutely different from the sadness that you feel during a tragedy, or during the loss of a loved one. But it is still sadness in its own way. It is still a loss in its own way.

You‚Äôre mourning the loss of what could have been. You‚Äôre mourning the fact that, at least for a little while, you thought you had found your person. You felt so happy and filled up and peaceful and you thought, *this is it. This is what everyone was talking about*.

You had someone to come home to at night. Someone to think about when the days were long and you were nervous about your job or your future or your grad school exams or your family troubles. This person didn‚Äôt get rid of your problems for you. But they helped you deal with them. They were like an energy around you ‚Äì difficulties could still creep through the shield, but they were less terrifying when you knew you had someone by your side.

And then in an instant, that all evaporated. Whether it was your choice or theirs or a mutual decision, it stings and consumes you and convinces you that this is all you‚Äôll ever be able to think about for the rest of your life. This is your story ‚Äì a happiness and then a breakup and then a¬†never-ending¬†bout of loneliness and depression that you‚Äôll never get away from.

You try to move on. You do the things you see in movie montages where the sad person is ‚Äúfixing‚Äù themselves ‚Äì you go on runs and you show up at happy hours and birthday parties and maybe you even go on a few dates. You try to smile, and to let out breaths of ‚Äúsatisfaction,‚Äù and to do anything else you‚Äôve seen on a screen that supposedly signify that *you are now okay*.

But none of it works. And you‚Äôre still heartbroken.

That‚Äôs because this is real life and there is no switch. There‚Äôs no audience planted in seats with bowls of popcorn, watching your movie for an hour and fifty-two minutes. Your life is not going to follow a setup:problem:climax:resolution storyline.

You will not have an *aha, I‚Äôm all better now!*¬†moment because those don‚Äôt exist in real life. We don‚Äôt heal in one perfect scene, on the top of a hill overlooking a city skyline.

We heal in little moments that we don‚Äôt even notice. One night, you fall asleep *without* dwelling on the fact that you didn‚Äôt say good night to them. You don‚Äôt even realize this happened, because you‚Äôre back at it the next night, tossing and turning and reminiscing on the times when you used to kiss each other good night or murmur sweetly on the phone. But still, that other night happened. The one where you just fell asleep without any sadness or dwelling. And another night like that will happen soon. And eventually, at some point, the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù nights will outweigh the sadness nights.

You will put yourself back together in bits and pieces. You will learn to enjoy your hobbies again. You will find new hobbies. You will watch the old shows you two used to watch together, you will watch new shows. You will still have days where you want to cry at work, and you will have other days where you‚Äôre too busy to even think about them.

Little by little, you will be okay. But that‚Äôs why heartbreak is so hard ‚Äì because it‚Äôs *little by little*. So little, in fact, that it often feels like you‚Äôre not making any progress. It feels like heartbreak is your fate and you might as well get used to it, because nothing is apparently changing.

You cannot go to bed each night wondering if tomorrow is THE DAY ‚Äì the day where you will wake up and *be okay again!* That‚Äôs not how it works, because tomorrow is not a plot point in your character arc. Tomorrow is just tomorrow.

But tomorrow is also another tiny piece in the *little by little* way that you are healing. It‚Äôs not noticeable, it doesn‚Äôt cause any significant change in your life. But it‚Äôs another day that you will wake¬†up, and do¬†stuff, and talk¬†to people, and keep¬†on living. It‚Äôs one more piece of proof in the argument that your life *will* go on without them.

It‚Äôs okay to feel shitty for a while. Just as long as you don‚Äôt get caught up in the idea that it will be like this forever. Because it won‚Äôt. Things will change. You will begin to become happier. You just won‚Äôt notice the change happening.

And then, one day, you‚Äôre sitting in your office chair, and there are no longer tears vibrating behind your eyelids. You don‚Äôt even notice this fact. All you know is that you‚Äôre doing your work. And you‚Äôre going to happy hour later. And you‚Äôre going to laugh without feeling weird about it. The world is still moving. Your life is still happening. You‚Äôre okay. You will be okay.",09Nov2019,1
89,"Chasing him is going to make you question your worth. It‚Äôs going to make you wonder why you‚Äôre always the one putting in so much effort, why you‚Äôre always the one initiating text conversations and planning romantic dates. It‚Äôs going to make you wonder whether it‚Äôs possible his feelings are even *half* as strong as yours when the way you treat each other is completely different. It‚Äôs going to make you wonder whether maybe you were wrong and he isn‚Äôt the right person for you, maybe you aren‚Äôt a perfect match, maybe you‚Äôve been chasing after the wrong heart yet again.

Chasing him is going to cause you to develop new insecurities. Even if you aren‚Äôt usually the jealous type, you‚Äôre going to get frustrated when he pays more attention to someone else, someone who hasn‚Äôt been treating him nearly as good as you‚Äôve been treating him, someone who couldn‚Äôt possibly love him as strongly as you love him. Eventually, you‚Äôre going to start comparing yourselves. You‚Äôre going to start wondering what he sees in them that he cannot find in you ‚Äî and you‚Äôre going to start wondering why you even bother to do so much for him when he doesn‚Äôt seem to appreciate it. But you have to remember, he doesn‚Äôt owe you anything. Your kindness doesn‚Äôt bind him to you. He never promised you anything.

Even though you‚Äôre crazy about him and have never felt this way before, chasing him might not be worth your time. It might not end with a happily ever after. It might not end with a real relationship. He might tell you he‚Äôs not interested in anything serious with you. He might turn around and start dating someone else. Or he might ghost you without giving you any sort of explanation. He might disappear from your life out of the blue and there‚Äôs nothing you can do to stop him.

Unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much work you put into loving someone. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many nice things you do for him. You cannot convince him to fall in love with you. You cannot force him to see your beauty. He could walk away without giving you a chance. He could decide you aren‚Äôt the right one for him ‚Äî and you have to accept it. There‚Äôs nothing you can do to change his mind.

Chasing him is a dangerous game to play, because if it doesn‚Äôt work out, you‚Äôre going to wonder why you weren‚Äôt *good* *enough*¬†for him. You‚Äôre going to feel like you did something wrong. You‚Äôre going to feel like all of the time and effort you put into him was a waste.

Even though you‚Äôre willing to do anything to call him yours, you have to remember, chasing after someone who isn‚Äôt all that interested is only going to hurt you. It‚Äôs better to hold out for someone who feels as strongly as you do since day one. Someone who is as excited about your love story as you are. Someone you never have to chase.",09Nov2019,1
90,"***\*WARNING: CONTAINS DEPRESSION, SEXUAL HARASSMENT, SELF-HARM AND SUICIDE. DO NOT TRIGGER YOURSELF.***

**-Notes:**   
**I had multiple phobias, including Death, Blood, Knives/Sharp Objects, Pain (I still have that), etc. for most of my life, up until I realized something is wrong. I basically ""taught"" myself over time to get over these phobias as to be able to find an emotional release.**   
**I also tend to objectify myself, speaking of myself as 2 different people: Person 1 is social, slightly awkward, straightforward, honest, curious and loyal. Person 2 is disapproving, rude, manipulative and sadistic. This person is usually the one telling me I'm not good enough, I deserve to get hurt, I should die, etc. I do my best to keep ""person 1"" act up around people as not to hurt them, and usually ""person 2"" breaks me down in the process. I do not know if this is a condition, or just my imagination, and frankly I'm too scared to find out, so I currently ignore it. I am also seeing a therapist, though have not told her about this.**   
**I have Asperger, and cannot emotionally relate to people (like feel sympathy), and I have no idea what pain is.**   
**Any questions, opinions or advice is welcome.**

I tend to shut memories out to protect myself from flashbacks. This has become such a normal thing that I can't help it. I will do my best to keep this as accurate as possible. The first time I started having suspicions about depression was around July 2017. I have always been completely obsessed with animals, sport, music and art. Between March and July 2017, where I was (for example) usually ecstatic to see my horse, I found myself barely able to get up to get ready. I have always been a good student, taking part in classes, studying for tests, easily answering questions, etc. Although I only noticed later, I'd become quiet in classes, barely made it through grades and couldn't be bothered to say something although I always knew answers. I saw a therapist briefly, though ""Person 2"" (before I even realized she was there, and just assumed it was me being myself) convinced me I was fine and nothing was wrong with me. This continued, worsening to complete loss of emotion, though I had a lot of mental breakdowns at the smallest bit of contact with people. In December 2017, my depression skyrocketed. I stopped eating for 2 weeks, spent days locked up in a dark room, and completely lost any will to do anything at all, though couldn't kill myself at the time since we were away the entire time and I never had access to the needed items. January 2018 school started soon after we returned.

In March 2018 I made a new friend (along with Asperger I have a really difficult time being social, so just being able to talk to someone was a huge achievement). She was extremely negative, constantly broke me down, and basically developed my depressed state. Around June 2018 I started cutting, though small, extremely light scrapes that did nothing. My fear of knives (that I only later found out I cannot experience) usually overwhelmed my desire to forget. In August 2018 I was sexually harassed by a friend and caused a lot of trust issues for me, as well as a phobia of men that I took a long time to get over. (Remember him, he's important. We'll call him Ryan). He constantly asked for pictures, sent me pictures, etc. I felt extremely betrayed, couldn't process why he'd do that, and it later turned into an extremely traumatic experience for me. September 2018 I started talking to a guy on my school bus that I had mutual friends with. He was the first to figure out I was depressed, though I was still denying it at that time. I didn't realize how fricked up this was until recently, but instead of doing whatever people are supposed to do (since I cannot relate emotionally to people, I don't understand their thought process to show e.g. support or sympathy, and only know how to by studying how they have), he offered to get me blades for cutting. I was pretty happy about it, since my cutting has developed a lot, especially because of the trauma, though still scrapes since the fear of pain was still present. He showed me how to get them out of sharpeners and gave me multiple. He moved away 2 months later. These blades were easier to hide, and since I'd never seen them before I had no fear of them and what they could do to me. (This is how my mind processes things, I apologize if it's confusing.) I started cutting worse, to the point of small amounts of blood, though never bad enough that it didn't heal in a max of 4 days. December 2018 I spent the entire vacation with a person very close to me, and it did lift my spirits a lot to be around them. This kept me from being depressed, and distracted me from any negative thoughts for most of the month and the majority of January 2019.

**-Side note because I feel like I need to explain this:**  
**As mentioned, I cannot feel pain. So no, cutting physically did not help me at all. ""Person 2"" just constantly convinced me that it Should hurt. That It's Supposed To Fix Things. Also, I hadn't realized at the time it didn't hurt. I believed that, and along with my fear of the (non-existent) pain, that's what made me keep cutting for as long as I did. I was in such a firm belief it should fix things I never thought about what it actually did.**  
**I also know this can be dangerous. If you can't feel pain, you never know how deep you cut. I'm aware. I researched the entire human anatomy beforehand. I know where all veins, arteries and nerves lay and how deep they are in the places that I do cut. I completely avoid arteries, and cut very lightly around major veins and nerves.**

February 2019, I made a lot of new friends, being in a better mood and all. Most of these friends were positive, supportive and helped my emotional state a lot. This continued on until May 2019, when Ryan and I reconnected. He hurt me again, twice, and sudden flashbacks started breaking me down again. Along with that, in the first week of June 2019, I stayed with my grandmother while my parents were in NYC. This was the worst week of my life. We were fighting constantly, my brother and I being told we were horrible people, we didn't deserve life, and a bunch of really fricked up things you shouldn't tell kids. Mid June, one of my best friends and I got into an argument. She spent months convincing me (person 1) and everybody else that I was a bad person, I was looking for attention, even daring to say that the sexual harassment thing was faked because I'm lonely. Along with everything else, every bit of happiness, trust and pride I'd built up since December 2018 was completely shattered. I cut a lot worse, unbothered if I was hitting an artery. I didn't eat nor sleep, shut out all of my friends and lost a lot of confidence. The person that got the worst of it was my best friend (note: he's a guy.) Along with what happened with Ryan, constant criticism from my father, and my phobia of men that I had almost gotten over before going back to old habits, I literally destroyed our entire relationship. (Remember him too. We'll call him Liam.) The entire June-July holiday, I slept. I couldn't control any of my urges, so I slept them all away to keep myself alive. This scene is also what split person 1 and 2 the worst and made me realize the severity of my situation.

Mid July, back to school. I was distant to my friends, and mostly kept to myself. Liam (bless him) was basically something like ""Nope, screw this,"" and we started talking again. We became a lot closer in that time, and by August we were closer than ever. I had formed an addiction to cutting at this point. My arms were (and still are) scarred from elbow to wrist, though I was (me being my stubborn arse self) denying any observations from friends that I needed help. It became even worse when a distant friend told me he uses razor blades, and I found them a lot better. They're extremely sharp, and a lot smaller. This continued on September 2019, when summer started. I had to stop wearing sleeves, and cut on my legs and stomach. This was new and weird to me though, and I soon stopped just out of awkwardness. Also, in this time Ryan and I started talking and we figured things out between us. I'm still extremely sensitive, but I no longer fear him or guys in general, and have become a lot better about the situation. I started seeing a therapist 2 months ago, but I'm still trying to get myself to trust her. I still have a lot of urges to cut, and I still get hit on constantly - reminding me of Ryan in the beginning, though I've improved a lot and currently I'm doing a lot better. Liam is currently my main source of support and comfort and I tell him everything, as I found it a lot easier to talk about something, or it might become traumatic later. I still have a lot of problems with person 2, and her comments have kept me insecure. I still don't know how to deal with her, and I'm yet to tell someone of her existence, but for the time being, I'm alive and well, and I plan on staying that way.

My life is in shambles. I‚Äôm sitting here eating my life away and crying. 

I‚Äôm on my period and I‚Äôm eating everything that‚Äôs unhealthy.  I had bariatric surgery and I‚Äôm not suppose to be eating this food. I had doughnuts, chips and candy. Now I‚Äôm eating chick fil a right now with a sandwich and drink. My doctor appointment is next week and I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm 4 lbs. away from losing 100 lbs and I‚Äôm wasting it away. I‚Äôm eating so much that I‚Äôm making myself sick. 

I can‚Äôt exercise because I don‚Äôt have the time because I‚Äôm working 3 jobs to keep myself afloat. I‚Äôm working to keep a roof over me and my dogs head. I‚Äôm seriously in debt. My job pays me shit and I hate it. My masters degree doesn‚Äôt help put me at a salary that I need. 

I moved to another city to have a fighting chance in this shitty economy and it has done nothing but push me back. I work in the mailroom with my masters degree. 

My romance life is what has me spiraling right now. I‚Äôm dating this woman but she lives in Seattle now. She had to move for a career opportunity. We been together for 4 years and this is the furthest we‚Äôve been from each other. With me living in Boston and not being able to make a living here. 

I love this woman with all my heart and she loves me as well. But our communication is shit. She barely calls or text me. We‚Äôre on two different schedules and that makes it hard. But sometimes I see that she‚Äôs available on Facebook and hasn‚Äôt contacted me once. 

Now in the meantime I have been dating other people.  I meet this awesome guy (or at least I thought he was) on a dating app. We went out and had 2 dates in a row. I was so overwhelmed with being touched and getting affection that I slept with him the second night. Since then I‚Äôve been texting him but he hasn‚Äôt really shown that he cares. 

I‚Äôm going through a lot and sometimes I want to give up. But the thing that keeps me going is my dog. Who will take care of her if I leave?

So my life fucking sucks",09Nov2019,1

Just like when she was toddler, she wants me to see everything she's doing, and still asks me rapidfire questions. She tells neverending stories. I turn my head to her calling ""Mom"" multiple times an hour.

94,"Hi all.
I‚Äôm 18, serving in the army.
I‚Äôm in an intelligence unit, so we don‚Äôt do physical stuff too much, but we study an absurd amount every single day. 
We need to be up and ready by 7 every day, and we get released to bed at midnight.
Meaning every day from 8 to 11 we study.
15 hours a day, and I‚Äôm not exaggerating.

Now, needless to say it‚Äôs extremely difficult. I go back home on Friday and Sunday morning have to be back in my base for another week of studying. It‚Äôll be like this till about January when we start our training.

Every day I wake up at 6:30, exhausted having barely slept 6 hours, knowing I now have 15 hours of studying ahead of me. 
I really try to be motivated and not let it get to me but this past week all I could think about was going back home. 

Does anyone have any tips to keep myself motivated in a shitty situation like this? Any tips for sleeping better or waking up less tired or just having a better morning? I‚Äôd really appreciate it !",09Nov2019,1
96,"I'm a freshman in college right now about to close off on my first semester and I feel like everything I've done up to this point was a stupid mistake.

First of all, I chose a major based on what my father wanted me to do. I know, it was dumb, but I didn't have the guts to do otherwise. 

I don't even know why I chose this school. Actually, I do. I picked it because it had a great program for a major I didn't even care about. It's a huge party school too. I'm not the party type, but I figured it wouldn't be too bad. I had no idea I would be lying awake at 2:00 a.m every day with people screaming and running down the halls. But they offered me money so I took the trip 1,600 miles away from home. 

I really dislike most of my classes. Which makes sense considering I have no interest in this field of study. I'm trying to trudge through. I have the added stress of wanting to change majors to computer science, which at this school (and a lot of schools I could transfer back home) require insanely high GPA's to even be considered.

So here I am. Stuck at a university I don't like, in a major I have no interest in, and almost completely alone.

I guess I kind of have a plan, but it all revolves around keeping my grades as high as I can. In reality, maybe it's not as bleak as I make it out to be. I am in some clubs so that gives me something to do. 

I just feel a little bit lonely. A little frustrated with my ignorance. And a little guilty about how much money is involved in this whole thing. I don't know if I'm asking for advice or suggestions but- although I will never reject it- I'd figure I might as well write it out, that tends to help sometimes.",09Nov2019,1

105,"Please don't end up like me. Don't give up on life so early, most of you have hope. Work towards small goals every single day and get good at something.

I'm a 25 year old NEET. No job, no car, no friends, anything. I don't even have any hobbies. I haven't spoken to anyone or left the house in 3 days. At this point I think I'm agoraphobic or have AVPD. Even though I am scared of people, I am also desperate for human contact. But I hate myself and feel inferior to all people, so I avoid others at all costs. In my mind I'm among the worst people who have ever existed. I'm stupid, lazy, aloof, boring, uninteresting, selfish, scared, weak, weird, awkward, socially inept, to extreme degrees. All of these traits combined make you worthless to other people. I have always felt infinitely inferior to, and overwhelmingly jealous of all the people around me, even people who are considered incompetent or not good people. I don't hate those people at all though, just myself. I have never accepted myself and I have hated myself for as long as I can remember.

The loneliness is the worst. The crushing despair I feel knowing I will never have friends, a girlfriend, or any human being who wants to be around me at all further demotivates me to do anything. I'm so far behind my peers, they all have jobs, friends, are in college, having sex daily, are in love, going out, partying, creating things, working on projects and hobbies.. I am so frustrated and jealous of them. I just want a normal life. I have no Idea why my brain doesnt work like theirs and I'm so incapable of getting basic human things like friends. I've never had any of these things that are a complete afterthought to them, I'm a virgin, never been to college, no friends, girlfriends or parties ever in my adult life. I had the same construction job, paying 8 then 9$ an hour for 7 years, which I hated so I finally quit. It took me years to even realize life doesn't just happen to you and sitting in your room jerking off isn't going to get you anywhere. Change at this point seems completely impossible.

Although I've been suicidal for many years, I resisted because I know it would bring sadness to some people. However I now understand I may have to be selfish about this. Their emotional pain will be short. 50 more years of loneliness, depression and self hatred will be unbearably long for me. I know I'm going to do it eventually, so I may as well do it soon. There's no sense waiting and prolonging my suffering for that long.

I will never have love, which defeats the purpose of doing anything. If there is no hope for love there is no point. I will never have love because I'm undesirable. Love is desire + trust built overtime. If there is nothing desirable about you, you're fucked.

Fuck.. I really just can't do this anymore.. My money will run out soon and I'll have to get a new shitty job. God if you're out there, let me redo this shit.. please..

Idk what the hell I'm saying anyways. Sorry to anyone that read this stupid, depressing shit. If you're young and not trying hard in life, please learn from my mistakes and do something meaningful with your life, take action towards your goals and don't become complacent. And stop watching porn.

My sister, the last of my family is worried I might die and she's coming over with her kids. All 4 of them. Normally I'd be pissed because I have to baby-proof my house. Today I don't care. I'm just too worn out to care. I warned her.

We are contagious and we are not getting out of bed today no matter who decides to show up.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is after she called, (while I watching the Outer Limits on Hulu), they did this weird retro commercial thing inbetween episodes and now I'm pretty sure the trees outside are going to grab and pull me out through the window. Poltergeist style 1982. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to lay in bed and be ill. Like can a bitch just take a day off already? My sister is going to show up, her kids are going to wreak havoc and they are going to wake the dead. I don't have the energy to deal with the displeased dead. I'm trying to not be one of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love my sister and I love her kids. Today is not the day they need to come over. If she doesn't bring chicken soup I can only assume she is actively waiting for me to die so she can take my place. Or maybe I'm just too high from the professional cough medicine to make an informed decision. Fuck what was I talking about again?",09Nov2019,1
111,"Background:I went to go visit family. On the way back home i started getting really nervous and started shivering. I'm not cold. Anyway, it started suddenly like out of nowhere. So im back at home and im full on shivering and fidgety. Nothing is wrong and everythings fine. So i go outside and my teeth start chattering. I go back inside and i start pacing. Then i start crying a little and i still have no idea why. I also got super nervous and pale. this all happened out of nowhere. i dont have car sickness nor was i worried about anything before this",09Nov2019,1
