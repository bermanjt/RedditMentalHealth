But you talked about animals and how much you love them and seeing you talk about them and how passionate you were, it was just so pure. You made me cry even though I never cry. I just can't anymore, but you made me. I think I can learn a lot from you. You are so pure",28Jul2019,0
1,"Whenever I play any first person roleplaying/shooter game (RPG/FPS), I feel lightheaded (dizzy) in about less than ten minutes of playing. No idea why. I feel perfectly fine as long as I can see my whole main character- third person view (like most Rockstar Games?) no matter how long I play.

According to google search, it sounds like motion sickness but I feel perfectly fine watching movies, in a car, on rollercoasters and such.

Anyone else feel this way?",28Jul2019,0
2,"I feel so lost and helpless living in 2019. I think that culture and technology have come too far. I really wish I could go back and experience the 80s/90s/early 2000s to be honest. It feels like the world has been very steadily getting a lot worse since 2006 or so? And this only accelerated around 2012.

3,"I’m a 21 year old female. I am in my last year of college, was student body President, tried to pass some legislation, and now I work as a daycare teacher. I’ve been depressed forever, just this year my parents took it seriously, I went to treatment, got really expensive meds, and a therapist. Now I go through highs and lows. I’m in a very bad low right now. I laid in bed all day today, but managed to do some dishes. My parents are supportive but I know they are sad that I never really got “cured” and still endure suicidal thoughts and major depressive episodes. I’m sorry.

4,"I did not even know this subreddit existed, so I was pretty excited when I found it.  I am a 35m and I honestly been single way more than I have not been.  I personally hate being single, and feel that since I am 35 I have this huge handicap when it comes to dating.  I work for the post office so I always work until 6pm.  I tried looking at meetups but there are no meetups relatively close.  The closest is 30 minutes away from me, and there are no women there.  I been on dating apps and have terrible to no luck.  Recently I got Tinder Gold from T-Mobile Tuesdays, so I decided to give it a try.  Found this one cute girl who matched with me, we talked and we had a lot in common.  We text every day since and made plans for a first date a few days later.  We met, had dinner, talked.  I thought it went really well.  We even talked about future dates and whatnot.  She told me to text her when I got home to make sure I got home ok.  So I did, and apparently, she blocked me right after.  I sent her a good morning text like I always have done and have not received a reply back, she would usually reply around 2 or 3.  This was 6pm and still nothing.  She told me before her apartment is a deadzone, so I tried to call he even though, after two rings it went to voicemail, which usually means they blocked you.  I tried to call from a different number just to see, she answered right away asking ""who's this""  when I told her who I was she scoffed and hung up the phone.

&amp;#x200B;

This is pretty much exactly how the last first date I went on, which was about 6 or 7 months ago.  I do not really get much matches on dating apps, and when I do the conversation usually dies in a few days or the match and never reply to my initial message.

&amp;#x200B;

I always hear to love yourself first, but to be honest I think that does not apply in today's society.  I actually have taken months off from dating apps and not even actively searched and nothing happened.  I been in one long term relationship which lasted almost 9 years.  I believe that since I been out of the dating world for so long I have a huge handicap and I have no idea what to do or where to start.  Obviously what I am doing is not working, but nobody has actually given me helpful advice to how to do things differently.",28Jul2019,0
6,"Been fighting depression, self harm and suicidal thoughts for a couple years now. To be honest a big part of the reason is debt, mostly because it's my own damn fault. I'm only 20 but I have almost $2,000 in credit card debt, $1,000 in other BS loan debt, around $1,000 in medical bills, about $10,000 in private student loan debt, another $7,500 in federal student loan debt, and owe about $3,000 to my old university for housing.


Add it up and it's like $24,000 which is more money than even either of my parents make in a year.



I should also say I haven't been able to make a single payment on most of this in well over a year, so it's almost all in collections which I don't even know what that means (I know I'm an idiot, spare me that at least). My credit score is *abysmal. * I think sub-400.


It'll probably be decades before I'm able to pay all of that off and just as long before my credit is repaired if it ever is. I won't be able to buy a car new or used, rent a house or apartment, sure as fuck not buy a house, get a personal loan for *anything, * won't be able to get any job that checks credit which I hear is becoming common, basically won't be able to do anything. I'm royally fucked for life, even if I ever get over my depression (and that's a HUGE if.)



I get calls, letters, emails all day every day and can't do anything but ignore them. I get probably 5-10 calls a day. As of right now I have 16 unheard voicemails which I'd guess are all asking me where the fuck the money is.


The cruelest part of it is even suicide wouldn't get rid of the debt, my family would just be forced to pay it which would literally probably make them homeless.


So yeah. Even if I magically got over my depression tomorrow my life would be completely fucked and miserable for *minimum* the next 10 years, probably more like 20.


Neat.",28Jul2019,6
7,"In about every conceivable way, except the ones I don't conceive of because I'm actually really privileged. 

I'm in a place I hate surrounded by people I hate with no money or recourse, I hate myself and what I've let my life become, I want a gun to shoot myself with above all else, but I also want somewhere to live I don't feel trapped in, I don't want to constantly think I'm going insane, I always feel like I'm about to explode.

I snap at people who are just trying to be nice to me because I'm mad at myself, and literally nothing except getting high is fun, but I can't do that anymore and it has diminishing returns even when I can. I had like one online friend, they were a good person but lied too, they harshly cut me off after saying they never would. Better for them, anyway.

There's literally nothing I can do for myself. In this situation or generally. I never could do anything for myself. It's amazing I've had so much luck to be the mediocre person I am when I can't engage with the world at anything more than the barest surface level. I don't know anything and can't interact with people. I'm constantly sad about no one caring about me but never wanted the responsibility of maintaining relationships (platonic, obviously never even had a chance for romantic).

I hate the bed I'm in. My old bed, in what I guess is my childhood room. I hate everything about it. I don't know how I tolerated it before leaving for college. I guess I didn't know better. I also hate my room. I hate almost all of the things in it. That online friend used to write me pep talk letters. They're nice, if empty. I read them occasionally to hear kind words in my head but they're incredibly empty letters, full of lies themselves but also written by someone who turned out not to care. That almost funny, double fuck-you is a neat and tidy metaphor for my life.

My dad died when I was 13 and I didn't, and to some extent still don't, believe it effected me majorly, but I'm certainly heading, head first, into all the unfortunate statistics surrounding those raised by single mothers. It's simply impossible for one working class person to both raise a family properly and provide properly. My mother did a good job of both but I still turned out fucked up, in my incapability to do anything worth doing. I can remember being broken like this before my dad died, so maybe these things can't really change. 

Humanity has an unfortunate habit of denying our own animal nature, driven by genetics, that subconsciously dictate almost everything we do. I think many more people would be at peace if social norms (for everyone's vague, mutual protection I guess) would erode that lie and make it more acceptable to be blunt where needed. 

I really want to smash my head into something, but don't have anything suitability hard, giving, and discreet around. Guess I'll just hold onto that anger too.",28Jul2019,0

13,"We went grocery shopping, just a couple things, so no cart needed. I’m carrying the bags in one hand and holding my wife’s hand in the other. With her other hand she is holding her cell phone and watching a video while I guide her through the parking lot to my car. 

I noticed she wasn’t paying attention, so I decided to take a detour. I went down a different aisle and slowly curved our walk at the end to start walking back toward the store.

We made it almost back to the store front when I turned again back up a different aisle. 

I crossed several aisles over to get to my car and walked right past my car and kept on leading her around the parking lot. This went on for one more loop around an aisle before I told her what I was doing. 

She stopped dead in her tracks and looked lost. She pouted, didn’t say a word and paid attention to where she was walking.

On our way back home she didn’t look at her phone at all, which is rare. And then she made a promise that she wouldn’t let her phone be the center of her world anymore.",28Jul2019,1

20,"Okay so, I have a weird fantasy about meeting a Youtuber who I watch a lot and ending up dating them.

This isn't a specific youtuber and this is a fantasy I have had since I was about 18. Its just, I guess you could call it a fetish?

Regardless, there is this youtuber I recently started watching, primarily because he's gorgeous, but he also produces content I genuinely like.

I developed a crush on him, watch all his new uploads. Tonight I noticed he was doing a live stream and some stupid part of my brain figured ""This is my chance!""

So I pop in on a superchat. I was kinda drunk. I told him if he noticed me I'd make a comic book about him.

Of course, he noticed and he shouted me out and i felt really proud for a moment. The chat was ignoring me entirely but I didn't care because HE noticed me (he had to, I paid him to.)

My mind was rushing thinking ""maybe he'll send me a message and we'll start talking and things will start happening! Maybe this is it!""

Not two moments later he mentions his wife off screen and she comes over to bring him a cup of water.

I sigh, and suddenly I feel mega stupid. I just wasted money so a guy I thought was cute would shout me out and maybe message me.

25,"Not really sure why I'm writing this tonight. Everything just feels so wrong in my life. I'm stuck and depressed. It's so hard being depressed for anyone, but when you have the external problems of a crap life situation compounding an already depressed state of mind... it's just hard yo really explain.

I guess I'll just start at the beginning of my downward spiral. I've struggled with diagnosed depression, OCD and ADHD for almost decade. I always had it somewhat under control, but never fully. Certain things could trigger my depression or anxiety. My OCD has always been severely life impacting and even after multiple types of therapy all I really learned was how to hide it from other people. 

Anyways about 2.5 years ago I move cross country for my fiance and also get transferred and promoted to a new position. It worked out perfectly... Or so I thought. There were hints for so long that she was cheating, but i guess i didn't want to believe it. Little things like different perfumes she'd wear or a friend of hers mentioning something different than what she said. I let it all go. I was alone. New city. Not really any friends. And a new department for me to manage with a hugely toxic work environment. 

This all maintained for about  a year. Nothing really improving and me hating life. Eventually i made the choice to talk to my fiance. She admitted nothing. I was the crazy one. Then my best friend from my home committed suicide. I think at first I just didn't believe it. Impossible i thought. Thr guy who is friends with everyone. The guy who cares and makes everyone laugh. I always felt lucky to call him my best friend  because he was just so damn awesome. Literally an amazing human. I blamed myself for a while. He called me the night he took his life and I didn't answer. Told myself I'd call him back the next day. Was busy with work or my fiance or my depression. Idk. Doesn't really matter now.

It ate at me. I know it's selfish and dumb to think I could have stopped him. But I look back on so many things now and I should have seen it. It just crushes me. 

About 2 months later my sister hung her self. She had always been there fkr me. Giving me advice. Telling me to be happy. To move home. To leave my fiance. I still can't believe that. It still makea no sense. 

I took some time off work. Saw therapists. Grief counselors. Etc. Didn't matter. Went back to work and my performance just declined until I was let go. My fiance came clean about cheating during one of our couple's sessions for therapy. I think that was whrn I really gave up. Didn't really have much fight left. Eventually we split completely. I was left homeless, jobless, and still in a spiral.

I lied to myself a lot. Told myself I had a plan. Things would be okay. At first they were. Until they weren't. I guess 8 months of being homeless and trying to just survive during freezing cold and extreme heat makes you lose your goal mindset. Only thing that really matters is surviving. No one really cares at the end. Sure there are programs and groups and non profits and this illusion that people who are homeless choose to be it. I can say absolutely that is false. There are so many hurdles to escaping and a lot of the time it just comes down to luck.

If it's a random section 8 program that does it based of a RNG instead of need or a program based off age. Nothing is perfect. You waste so much time and energy fighting little battles. Things people never think about. How often to change socks? Do I smell bad today? Hurting yourself when you have no insurance. Getting taken advantage of by shady companies.

It is just too much without anyone to care. Being alone in this craphole when I'm already depressed and having even more thrown on top is just the worst most suffocating feeling in the world. I want to scream and cry all at once. 

How could my car breakdown? How could I be so dumb and trust some random tow truck driver? Why did I sign those papers without looking? How am I so broke that i can't afford $200 to get my car back? Will i be able to get it back and get it fixed? It's going to be more expensive everyday? 

Idk anymore. Honestly it's just too much for anyone. I'm barely making it to work and last night I couldn't even grt into the shelter since it was so late. I just slept behind the building. 

I'm not sure if I'm writing this as a warning to others to not let your mental issues take control or if I'm just crying for help. Maybe I'm just done. I really don't know. I've thought about giving up so many times the last few months, but i really do want to live. I want to succeed and be loved and have a pet dog and an apartment and a bed again. Right now I'd just be so happy to have my car back. Literally the only thing I have left.

45,"Hey everyone, I’m on here to try and gather some advice on a situation that’s been really stressing me out lately. (As a result of my own stupidity may I add). I have to admit something to someone that I’ve been lying about and have NO idea how to go about it. 

Context is necessary to the story: I met a boy on tinder around last November and we’ve been talking on and off since then. Initially, things were great. We were both super stoked ok the idea of meeting and I could tell right off the bat that this dude was really something special from the hours we’d spend on FaceTime or text. Unfortunately, I thought it’d be a great idea to lie about my age. Because of this, I never went through with meeting him. I was scared he wouldn’t want to talk to me because I’m two years younger than him, so I told him I was his age. Big mistake. I never thought I’d develop this much of an interest in him and literally have dreams about meeting him and hanging out with him to this day. He moved to another state like two weeks after I matched with him so my window to see him was very limited. We lost contact for a little with the occasional response to something I’d post on Instagram or Snapchat, but now we’ve started talking again and he’s apparently going to be in town. He wants to hangout, I’ve never met anyone that I’ve naturally gotten along with more than this guy (I know I sound insane and you’re probably thinking I’m crazy as I haven’t even met him but trust me on this one), and I am scared shitless because he needs to know the truth. 

I genuinely feel awful about lying, and am extremely apprehensive to tell him since I don’t know what his reaction will be like and really really like him. I’m pretty adamant he feels the same too. although the contact has been minimal, he’s made sure to keep in touch even if it’s small things that don’t ensue an entire conversation.

Whenever I text people, I am able to hold a conversation, appropriately respond, and I have this confidence backing the words that I type. I feel as if I lack these within different forms of communication.

I find myself struggling to find topics at which we can conversate upon, I am worried that I might mess up my speech, or my message will be unclear. I am able enough to hold basic ""Hey, what's going on?"" conversations, but rarely do I ever get past that stage.

I have no doubt, that given the cards I was dealt, that I will have a problem asking a girl, for example, out on a date, but I have this uncertainty in my mind that I will be able to go on this date successfully. Every situation I mentally put myself into ends in a shameful attempt at a date, just an awkward disater.

50,"I don't really have anywhere else to put this

I've been hollowing from the inside out. This past life is consuming me from where it hurts the most and moving outward. I had a life and friends and people I loved, some I would die for. And now it's all gone, and everywhere I go is just a constant reminder of who I was. 

Empty chat rooms, old saved messages, year old pictures of events and small connections and bonds that I formed with these people, all severed. Every day I go barely socially interacting with anyone, and while I have made peace with the problems that have unfolded in my wake, the repercussions of these are too much to bear. I feel like my old life was taken from me, and put somewhere else, like I am an uprooted tree, that has been planted in dry, old soil. I want to go back, I want to reset, had I known there was a timer, there were so many more things I wanted to do, things I *should have done*. People to meet places to go, relationships to be forged. Now I've been cast into the shadow of my former life, only half the person I was. I've been working out recently to cope with it all. 

There's a girl, who I loved. She never saw anything in me, but we were best friends. She and I would walk to the bus every morning in the cold temperatures of September, the leaves crunching under our feet. I still remember the laughs we shared, and the gloves she wore. Those were my gloves, and I gave them to her on a particularly cold morning. I would always wait under the street lamp for her. Hold her coffee and we'd sit on the bus together too. On the day I left, her embrace was nothing to warm the coldness I felt, even if she never saw anything more in me than a friend. I still see her on social media, the texts we sent, memes we shared. I look through it from time to time. I miss her. 

I was so happy. My life then may have not been perfect, but I was content with what I had. It was enough for me to be happy. This new family I have; they aren't bad people. They welcomed me with open arms and I appreciate that. They take us to places I've never been and vacations to resorts with exquisite service. But its only medicine for the pain, and not a cure. I am not dishonoring their efforts to make me feel better but you cannot expect me to have healed already after having so many big changes happen in such a short time. 

My father, is experiencing the same thing. After he moved out of the house, he experienced major depressions and is still in a bad place. It has only been 4 months since he left. 

I fail to see the good in all of this because my vision is clouded. I know that. I'm different. People I knew won't talk to me anymore. Friends I had became distant. And wether or not the fault falls on me or them remains a mystery to me. Every time I log on to Instagram I see all the posts of my former friends. I don't want to detach myself from them. It's quite the contrary. I'm clinging to stay in their lives and be apart of something at least. I see they want to forget about me and move on. And honestly, I can't blame them. I grieve. I grieve alot. And these events that have befalled me are not first world problems by any means. But I have nowhere else to put these words, and letting them out is better for me than keeping them in. That is all.",28Jul2019,1

59,"&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, i am aware that the phenonama of Gang Stalking is largely paranoic, and have questioned my feelings many times that i am not indulging them. However the proof that this is not so is so stark, that sadly it really is the case. I have had repeated confirmation, from overhearing people, to people's reaction, to just the sheer weight of evidence.

In my case i make no claims of some shadowy or coordinated group, rather it stems from people taking humiliating pictures of me, and putting them online, and the whole thing snowballing. For the month or so after i was oblivious and started to notice people laughing and acting weird around me, but put it down to me being caught up with myself. I heard people talking, directly about me, and saying 'thats the guy' and so on, had people laugh at me in street. After a few months i moved out of the town i was living in on acct of it. It had made me nervous to leave the house, even borderline agrophobic.

This was 8 years ago, i've since lived all over europe, in around 6 differnt countries. It has followed me seemingly where ever i go. Ive had people take my picture, brazenly, uncountable people laugh at me, heard people talking behind my back, mocking me. I guess it's become a 'thing' to take pictures, and somewhere online there must a page where these are compiled. I even challenged one person when she took my picture, saying 'i saw what you did, i think its pathetic', to which she reacted in what i can only describe as borderline hysterical laughter. I guess she realised that i knew at that point, whereas the assumption was that i was oblvious.

I spent 4 months in that city, and in that time i saw 5 people unquestionably take my photo. 2 of them brazenly and without even trying to hide it. I can only assume there must be any number of photos from over the years that i DIDNT notice. Me on busses, in the streets, back when i was going out, in bars and so on. It's so easy to take a photo these days with smartphones. If it became 'a game' to do so, i can only begin to imagine how many images there are of me. How people could manipulate them, zoom in, mess around create GIFS etc etc etc It's all so vampiric.

Now i'm so paranoid and worn down that i've withdrawn, and move around almost constantly trying to keep one step ahead. Problem is that normal things happen and i get nervous. Like if i hear laughter from people in the street. Or bar or wherever. I'm not delusional enough to think this is about me, i realise the Spot Light effect, and it's all been so massively heightened by these incidents. But it's left me constantly reading situations 'were they looking at me when they laughed' trying to read body language, watching out for signs of any focus being on me when people laugh'. It's at the point now where i think i have a literal disorder formed through it.

It's like my senses are so honed for this stuff. Plus it feels like there is so much 'ammunition' stored against me, and with all these people being made aware of it, all it takes is one person who for whatever reason knows me on some level, and doesnt like me, they can really use it against me.

I'm exhausted with it all. I've gone from being a fun outgoing guy in my early 30s, to a socially withdrawn loner 8 years later. I spend pretty much my entire life on my own now. It makes me sad and though i try to fight it, bitter, that just because these people wanted a cheap laugh the cost is my life, happiness and mental well being.

For the record, I am an unremarkable looking person, people are not photoing me because i am particularly attractive or ugly, or anything that outwardly stands out. I am an otherwise healthy normal looking man in late 30s.",28Jul2019,3
60,"Ok, so for some context, I’ve been growing out my hair for 7 months now. It’s not the best looking, but i take care of it properly so it’s not unclean or gross looking, just a bit shaggy. I’ve been looking for a job for most of that time, and while I’ve had mixed success and been employed for a while, I’ve had to quit my most recent job due to my boss being very controlling and constantly harassing me.

Anyway, I’ve just gotten info that I might be getting an interview for a pathologist assistant. It would be perfect for me, as I’ve been accepted into a university but lack the funds to afford board and food. If I get this job it would help me get experience in the career line I would like to pursue, and might even be my job while I study at the University as they have another location in the city I’m studying in.

For the interview, I might have to cut my hair to look a bit better.

And this is where it’s gets really complicated, because if I don’t cut my hair, it might mean I can’t get into uni, but if I do, I’ll feel terrible.

For some reason that I can’t understand, I’ve grown really attached to my hair, having long hair is really important to me, and I feel really depressed about cutting it, I’m tossing and turning at night about it. 

I was forced into a hairdressers a few weeks ago and was about to get it cut but my anxiety peaked and I just ran out. 

This whole situation if fucking stupid and I feel like a complete fool, but I can’t get over it.

I’ll probably end up getting it cut short, even if it makes me feel like shit for the rest of the year. I just need to tell someone about it, cause I can’t talk about it otherwise.",28Jul2019,1
61,"Backstory: I was drunk doing the dishes and I broke a glass. My stupid ass wanted to prove to my roommate how glass doesn't cut and a whole ""you won't"" started. I ended up cutting 6 slits in the back of my hand; Not deep or anything, just looked very self-harm like. 

Next day I go to a lecture, and clarified my story to one of my acquaintances I sit next to. He told me how relieved he was to here it was just a drunk story and that I wasn't going through anything. If I didn't bring it up he would have stayed quiet. Relatively the same conversation occurred when I'd tell my friends about the story. 

Going out in public and ordering in restaurants felt incredibly embarrassing. My hand created the image of an an attention whore trying to draw pity and I'd notice people passing silent judgments. 

I never realized how difficult people who self-harm have it in society. Wow, I felt crazy judged, I can only imagine how crippling that would be to someone who is actually suffering from severe depression. 

I may be amplifying the situation, however, the point remains the same.

62,"I find myself asking the question ""Why?"" all too often. It's strange how momentum and for that matter, ambition are all too fleeting in my life. There are moments in which I feel like the world is mine, then those which I question if I truly want this world. To be deemed successful one most hone a skill -- a trade, and not just any trade; but a trade that society has deemed worthwhile. Many consider this the path to happiness. While other paths, are looked down upon and often thought of as wasteful. I find it ironic, being that life itself is fleeting, that there are those who place an objective value on happiness, and thus can deem mediums of joy as a ""waste of time"".  When in reality, we all ultimately die and thus shouldn't the highest value of time be that which provides you the most joy, and therefore, happiness? But this is not the reality of society. Only given two options, neither of which look appealing. Option A; Use nearly a decade of my life, my youth, to learn something that will provide me monetary benefit, and therefore ""happiness"" as a result. Or Option B: ""waste"" my time, providing immediate happiness, but no financial gain, that which is everything in (American) society. These options persistently conflict in my mind and I can't enjoy anything as a result because Option A always wins. Playing in the back of my head like a bad song on repeat. My family often says to me, ""Life is Work"", and that ""You can rest when you're dead."" but is this really living? It's such a shame that the gift of life is wasted just so one can enjoy the ending better.

66,"I’m always awkward carrying out conversations with her and I hardly make her laugh. I know she prefers other people’s company to mine, and I’m accepting of that— we aren’t each others’ first priorities as is usual with most people in this world. But why do we have a connection at all? It’s easy for her to say “Love you, good night” but harder of her to try to keep in contact. We even argue sometimes about the dumbest shit in politics, so she must just be kind. I never considered kindness as the word to describe it until a mutual friend had dubbed her that first.

I used to be kind too when my social anxiety was off the walls but recovering halfway from it has just made me a desensitized person. She values suffering when I’ve forgotten to. I used to look at her and think that she was just like me. Hell we had the same list of psychiatric diagnoses, the same interests, the same favorite books. I used to get jealous of her and want to compete with her while being attracted to her, and I think she could have been jealous of me as well. I did always assume that she first befriended me when she had the impression of me being intellectually connected to her crush.

My faith in our friendship is always vacillating, and I would feel not bad about myself, but guilty for her, if she didn’t enjoy our time together.

69,"I'm not entirely sure why I'm posting this. Maybe for support, maybe for someone else to relate, or maybe just to sort my head out.

I was in an abusive relationship for about 6 months from October last year. In some ways, I'm still in it, as he still contacts me (I remain in contact solely because he owes me money. It's not tonnes but I'm really living off scraps that I can get from psychological experiments and sparing shifts at work while my university is closed for summer and my loan has run dry. Just cutting my losses kind of isn't an option). The title is maybe a little misleading. I have met 3 people since my ex. One has become a friend, one was only interested in a one night stand (I declined and he was totally fine with it), and one... One I really fell for. But my ex ruined it. He was significantly more involved in my life then than now, because he still lived on campus (we were both in first year). I was devastated. 

So, when I say first date after him, I mean my first date where he cannot be involved. I still live in the area, a gorgeous house a few minutes from campus. My best friend lives nearby. I'm happy and wanted to dip my toe in after the whole ass mess I'd gone through a few months prior.

I met the guy on Tinder (I'm not the most social). He was from my uni, but had graduated and moved a little away but not too far. After living so close to my ex this concept was refreshing. We spoke for a while and got on so well. Same sense of humour, common interests... I told him about my ex (not the whole story but a little overview) as kind of a... Warning? A ""hey, I get it if this is too much baggage. I quite like you so I'd rather you know and ditch me now than find out later when it'll hurt more"". He was fine with it. He understood. So my antisocial ass decided I was gonna accept his offer to meet.

He was the one who asked to meet. He arranged the time, the date, the place. He was responsive in the morning, so I decided to head down. I needed to go to the shop anyway so it wasn't a completely wasted trip. I waited around for about 45 minutes, wandering around town/to the station/the shops. I messaged and got nothing, despite him being online. Eventually I decided to get an uber home and do my laundry. 

I'm not even sure what to think at this point. A conversation like that on Tinder happens so rarely for me. I'm not crying or angry I'm just... Empty. Like... I should have expected this. I'm damaged goods and not very good looking goods at that, and I should totally have expected to be blown off. As of now (it's about 1:20pm, we were due to meet at 12) I've heard nothing from him, and I doubt I will.

I guess I'd just like someone to tell me what to do, since whenever I try to take control of my life it seems to go wrong. Do I just give up trying to meet someone? I'm not unhappy alone, but it would be nice to have someone, you know?",28Jul2019,1

72,"I’m a teacher and as such every summer is a renewal, but this one has been a little rough.  I’ve been happily married to an incredible guy (also a teacher) for 3 years after moving to a new town together 6 years ago.  We are r/fencesitters and have 3 cats. We bought a house for cheap at a great time in a market where people do tend to move frequently. We don’t *love* the city we’re in but it’s been good to us, our housing is crazy affordable, and we both enjoy our jobs. Well, my job is kinda shitty but I get by with a little help from my friends, you know?  

This whining about friends feels so much like middle school, but here I am. I am a pretty unique and independent person, and with being married and everything I haven’t exactly been begging to hang out, but I’m very extroverted and social and love to have a good time. While somewhat self-conscious and still healing from a mental health episode in my early 20s, I feel pretty good about myself and don’t struggle with FOMO as much as I used to.  My husband is my best friend and while I prefer to spend time with him, I very much value my platonic friendships. I had a large group of friends through a master’s program I was in, but since graduating most of those people have moved. I also have had a nice little circle of coworkers that I would get happy hour with. I would say by this time last year, I had a solid group of 10ish people of all ages that I would hang out with and have over for booze and cheeseplates.

 I’ve known for a while that my best friend in town was moving at the end of this school year, and I feel that I prepared myself pretty well mentally for that transition. Over the last two months or so, however, there’s been a collapse in my house of cards. I work at a difficult school and when school ended I found out that 7 of my coworkers will not be returning.  Shortly thereafter, a couple we’re friends with got into law school and the husband of one of my dearest friends got a new job. Just today, my closest coworker, assistant coach, and dear friend/mentee disclosed that she too would be taking up an amazing new job elsewhere. 

I’m self aware enough to try to not take these moves personally- I know this is a transient stage of life. I also know that while pain is inevitable, suffering is optional.  However, I just can’t help but feeling down and lost about things. My husband is kind and sympathetic, but he understands that this is a different sort of relationship that I am mourning.  

I’m not in a rush to make new friends necessarily, but I am trying to protect and take care of myself, which I think lends itself to making new connections. I’ve gone to a bunch of yoga classes (which I have always loved but never done with friends or anything) and I am trying to stop drinking as much (which I suppose is an upside to an absence of social life) and I am thinking about taking a new type of class or something. 

I guess I knew that 30 was going to be different on some level, but I didn’t think it would take a lot of people I know and care about to move away to get here. Maybe part of it is that with everyone heading out,  I’m feeling stuck. Now I’m wondering if I should jump ship and find a new job. Maybe I should cut my hair?  Is this the type of thing that makes people just decide to have kids?  It feels silly and ungrateful for the beautiful life and home I have with my husband, but I’m just- what are the kids saying these days?- all in my feelings about it.",28Jul2019,1

This migraine is killing me. I went out today with my family for a few hours and I always find it unbelievable the fact that they're able to shop all day without even having a sip of water.

It's like there's this thing hammering a particular portion of my head and it hammers faster if I do something physically active again. It hurts a lot. I drank lots of water when I got home tho so I hope the migraine would start going away. It seems like this doesn't happen to a lot of people. My friends can survive an entire day with just food and no water. They drink when they only feel thirsty, but I have to drink because it's necessary.

83,"I had no idea how to title this but anyway, I have a crush on this guy, we were together in a course that now is that over, 5 of us we’re there before classes started because we were kind of working there so we were already bonded when everyone else arrived. He then made other friends and bonded better with them but we’re still close.

Now that that course is over he’s keeping in touch (I’m saying he because I can’t text first for the life of me), we have a group chat with just the 5 of us and I’ve noticed that whenever something happens in his life he’ll text me, I thought he did the same thing with everyone else but no.

For example, the other day he got a job and that same day he told me about it, days after that subject appeared on our group chat and just then he told everyone else about the job, no one knew about it until then.

He always does this, he talks to me first and then when someone brings up the subject on the group chat or they ask about it, then he’ll tell them.

You know what I mean? I know It doesn’t mean that he likes me but it makes me feel special and I’m happy.",28Jul2019,1
85,"Two and a half years ago I was suffering from a severe case of mono. Nothing to worry about in most cases, but in mine it almost crushed me. I completely withdrew from social life for months because I was scared I could catch another disease or worsen the current one. I developed a germophobia that made me wash my hands every time I touched something. To top it all off, I was unable to work my part time job as a supervisor in a call center. I eventually quit my job and depleted my savings to survive.

My doctor advised me to go see see a shrink. Luckily I live in Europe and my public health insurance covers basically everything, including seeing a shrink.

And so I did. This was in June 2017.

In July 2019 I can actually eat out of my hands without having to wash them before (I still prefer to wash them, though). I directed a play together with the best people I could imagine. I traveled Europe all by myself just to get out of my comfort zone. I found a full time job with purpose that pays well and I actually enjoy doing. 

In short: I am able to enjoy life again and I would advice anyone who has the same privilege as I had to go see a shrink if you need to. Feel free to ama.

I still see him once a month. I don't really need him anymore to be honest but he became kind of an assurance that in case something like the mono would happen again, I could cope with it much easier.",28Jul2019,1

88,"In the last month my future went from looking very bright and surreal to something much less exciting and frankly a bit depressing.

I had gotten an amazing international internship, a promising job offer lined up for after my return,   
I was flying through my exams, and  was, in general, living it up in my apartment with my best friend.

But suddenly the internship didn't pan out for reasons outside anyone's control.

And on the same day my dream job rejected me before I even applied.

I had a break down and canceled half of my exams, pushing 4 of them to September.

Since then, I've been doing mental gymnastics trying to keep my spirits high while I watch everyone I know succeed beyond belief and plan amazing summer trips while I sit at home studying and pretending everything is fine. My best friend and roommate also got a chance to go abroad which means for the next 6 months  I will be living with complete strangers and sorely missing my friend.

These next two months are going to be especially difficult as this is a college town and almost everyone I know will go home- I will be alone with no one to talk to and nothing to do except study for exams for about 8 solid weeks.

I absolutely know myself and can guarantee that this is a recipe for disaster for me and will lead to a two-month pity party/depression spell if I don't figure something out soon. I need a goal (preferably one that is time-consuming but roughly ""achievable"" in 8 weeks)  so I have something to look forward to.

I want to make **use** of this time, so I can look back on it as a growing pain rather than a huge disappointment.

92," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.iv seen dudes sit there and she seems different and happy and then she’s all bubbly then as opposed to her usually being snotty af


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself. 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",28Jul2019,0

94,"I’m 36 and I’ve reached a moment of horrifying clarity that I’ve ruined my life in a way that is impossible to turn around.

I know this is an incredible long and maudlin post, I do apologize for this rambling mess but I have no idea what to do and sending my voice out into space is the only thing I can think of at the moment to easy the pain and anxiety I’m in. 

The circumstances of my life are as such, when I was in high school I was obsessed with art, film, and acting/performance art. I would draw and make short films with an intensity of focus bordering on tunnel vision. I now see this as also a coping mechanism for my turbulent family life. My parents had me young and had an incredibly messy divorce, blamed having me for their wasted lives and promptly kicked me out the second I turned 18, refusing to help pay or navigate the paperwork/logistics to go to college. I was truly terrified of school debt and the application process so I avoided it all together. At the time I looked up to guys like Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Paul Thomas Anderson. Basically everyone that preached “going to films” instead of going to film school. This felt safe to me and justified my decision(out of fear) to not go to school. So I hung around my home town working in the same grocery store high school job dreaming of making a film that would get me out of there and into a career. I was going to be Soderbergh. I was going to be Spike Lee or Linklater. Of course this was the terrible decision making skills of an 18 year old kid with absolutely zero adult guidance. In reality, I was gearing up for a life of being nothing. At first I did work on the side, but as the years ticked by I got more and more depressed and my creative output ground to a halt. I stayed working menial customer service jobs and my depression grew and grew as all of my friends moved on without me. First through undergrad then graduate school and finally respectable positions like professors and doctors. Meanwhile, I’m still working at a locally run grocery store. I read a lot and take in a lot of art, eclectic interests, so I still feel intelligent can hang/keep up with social situations/conversation despite my deprived environment. During these years dating became harder and harder. I had a decent personality and could be charming despite the fact that my exterior life in no way matched my internal life or who I am as a person. It’s easier to keep this up when you are 25 but It became a very big problem as I approached my thirties. I found relationships would have about a six month expiration due to the fact that I am very depressed, not doing anything with identifiable with my life and have no money. My internal life was rich but my external life had atrophied. I was very good at hiding these things and I put forth a very cheerful and easy going demeanor when in reality I was severely depressed and scared out of my mind about what I was going to do 24/7. The familiarity in relationships was a danger as the hold on that normal facade would crack the more comfortable I became. What kept me going was the ability to fantasize about this other life I could be leading, that of a filmmaker or artist. Or the fantasy of having a fulfilling relationship. That helped me get through the majority of grueling days but also prevented me from making any big change or steps out. I was constantly looking for bandaid solutions rather than treating the larger problem causing my severe depression, which of course were the environmental ones. I got into working out. I got into tarot cards. I got into poetry. Anything really to keep my brain occupied. Flash forward to now, two decades flew by faster than I could comprehend and I’m 36. I’ve accrued $9,000 of meaningless credit card debt and I’m still working an easy, slightly above minimum wage job. I couldn’t afford a car so I’ve been biking to work the last three years which felt amazing apart from the social negatives of not having a car. I was also working out more intensely to have a decent body to make up for all the things lacking about my life. I’d go on dates feeling like a Swiss cheese person, with all these gaps and holes in my life. My misguided thought was maybe I’d be able to enter a relationship and they’d let the more rotten parts of my life slide. I figured, if I can’t find meaning in the only career I wanted, at least I could find meaning in a relationship. Time spent with someone I love helps to suppress the depression and makes me feel like I’m spending my life in a more meaningful way. 
Well, this year everything came crashing down in a total collapse and all of the supports I had keeping me afloat crumbled. It’s like all of the bad decisions I had been making consistently for over a decade were slowly loading a punch with enough knock out power to put me down permanently. I started the year in a relationship with someone I’m crazy about, unfortunately six months in I developed an injury from a decade of accumulative tension due to poor squatting/powerlifting form and running, rugby and bike commuting and extreme anxiety. It’s a rare and freak thing but in conjunction with two labrum tears in my hips I have pelvic floor dysfunction which manifests in all sorts of terrible discomforts the most severe being medication resistant erectile dysfunction. The stress of this caused my relationship to implode and I lost this person and all hope of a future relationship. The doctors seem clueless and give little help besides PT(which I can’t afford with my insurance) to alleviate my symptoms. It’s possible this might be permanent and sex may be out of the question from now on. This caused an even more severe spiral into depression. I’ve been prescribed anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds, but neither are doing the trick. The worst thing of all is this has snapped me out of the idiotic fantasy I’ve been living in the past twenty years. I feel like I’ve been in a coma for the last twenty years while someone else was living(and ruining) my life. I can’t believe I’d make such a stupid decision as to think I’d make movies on my own, so far from LA or NY and that would actually pan out to something like a career. Now I’m incredibly regretful for having not applied myself when I was younger and gone to college. It’s clear I needed structure and it’s very hard to survive in this world without it. Especially the incredibly vague path of the art world. All I wanted in my life was to make films or be in that world and make art and I’ve ruined all chance of that now. I recently lost my apartment and I’m crashing on my friend’s floor. I am not riding my bike or working out anymore, just taking a bus everywhere. My exercise now is stretching, some yoga and long walks early in the morning because I can’t sleep. Everyone tells me to get a job at Whole Foods because of the benefits but it feels awful knowing that’s all I’m qualified for after all these years. With no marketable skills or education, what did I expect. Also, the world of film has changed so much today and the type of auteurs I looked up to don’t exist anymore, especially with streaming content. It’s very hard and sobering. Seeing movies and art made by people my age or younger is also painful. I feel like I’m grieving my own life, like I was committing a very slow form of suicide the past few decades for no reason whatsoever and nothing to show for it, except to say I was very depressed. The conclusion is, I don’t know what hope I have now. I know it’s impossible that I’ll ever be a filmmaker or work in that field at this age, I blew that completely. Working a minimum wage job is not sustainable but that’s all I’m qualified for.  I have a hard time figuring out what career I could fit in that would be better, because I have interest in nothing else. I have no car, or apartment. My friends have almost all moved on and moved away. I can’t sleep at night due to constant stress/being in fight or flight mode. The last few months I’ve just been completely adrift doing the bare minimum to survive and it feels like that’s all the future holds for me. I think about suicide almost constantly as my day to day is racked with pain and pointlessness. I took psychedelics out of boredom and a hope that it would free my mind from such rigid depressive thought, but that resulted in a series of bad trips spent sobbing under a blanket. I have no idea what to do. It seems like I’d have to accept my current situation, accept that my dreams are not going to come true and I’m at fault for that, but I just don’t think I can. How do you forgive yourself for pointlessly ruining your own life? It’s all so needless and it was all so preventable too. I ruined my body out of vanity, because i hated it and  thought no one would date me unless I looked good and I ruined my career out of fear, depression and anxiety. For my adult life I didn’t make any risky decision out of irrational fear I’d make the wrong decision but in making NO decision I chose the worst life. I just have no idea how to proceed or dig myself out of this deep deep hole. I truly understand hopelessness now and when I think about my life it amounts to the most cliche, whiny story about being swallowed up in a meaningless life, a slave to debt and bad decisions. I just spent my entire life in this delusion that things would work out and seeing with clarity now that things will not and I have to live with the consequences of these decisions is too much to bear. I’ve always had a lot of resilience and could take a lot of needless punishment, but I’ve reached the burn out breaking point. At the worst I feel like I’m wasting away in the void. I don’t belong anywhere or to anyone but I have a desperate need to be somewhere else. I clearly needed guidance, especially when I was younger, but I’m at a lack now. I’ve tried life coaches therapists, but the pool is small with my insurance and financial situation. I gambled my life away on a extremely stupid teenage ambition and I went into a depressive coma for two decades. I deserve what I got.  It’s pathetic to sit here and cry about it now that the shit has hit the fan in a big way, but alas, What can I do? What am I going to do? I live with this constant hum of pain, like I have a migraine of the soul.

While I was in the swimming pool, I saw a girl of my age with a familiar face (I don't know why but it seemed like I already saw her) so I looked at her until our eyes meet and there started the ""eye contact battle"" between us.
I think we both liked each other but for many factors such as: my shyness,our different language(I think she knows English anyway) and because we both had our families near us I didn't approach her. This thing happened everytime I went to the swimming pool.
I left the hotel yesterday and felt bad that I won't never see her again, even if we didn't talk there was something I liked of her so I searched the hotel place on instagram and looked the recent posts and actually found her!

100,"So I was on a date yesterday with this really cute girl that I met online. We decided to take the Metro to Downtown LA get a couple churros, walk around and talk. While we were taking the train back there was this guy with one of his little speakers and rapping and acting like he was all tough shit. You know the kind of stuff that some would take that this person is going to try to start a fight with someone.

So this girl and I are just on the seats next to each other talking not paying the slightest attention and this guy walks past during a stop looks directly at me and her and then says, ""you can suck my dick white boy."" Just to be sure of what I heard, because he had that blaring speaker on, I look over at my date and ask her what he just said? And she confirmed to be what he had said. She didn't want to tell me at first because maybe she had thought that I would take offense to it or something. So I laugh it off and observe his behaviour for the rest of the ride nonchalantly, just in case he were to approach us aggressively on our way out. It makes no sense to me in those situations where someone thinks they can start a fight with you and feel justified in being a racist dick at the same time. Just to clarify my date is black, Mr. Thinks he's a good rapper is black and I'm white for why I feel the unnecessary racial comments.

So this belligerently obnoxious d-bag blasting his own music and rapping to it on the train has the audacity just to look at strangers and do crap like this. It kind of just makes no sense to me. Sometimes I really don't understand the mentality of people and how they can just feel like they can do what they want, when they want to whoever they want without consequence. The guy's lucky that I'm not one of the aggressive d- bags that would take great offense to this and start a fight with them which I'm quite sure is exactly what he wanted. I'm the kind of person that doesn't start fights, but stops them. I mean obviously the guy has plenty of problems in his life to the point of where he needs to project his anger and mood onto others, but it's not something that I feel necessary to respond to anymore.

108,"I'm a graphic design student and I'm in last semester right now.

When I first started this course I was really excited to finally do something I actually wanted to do after being put through two years of hell studying math and physics because my mum wanted me to complete A-Levels. 

I joined this private design college which is really well regarded in the country. I got in thinking it would be a very competitive and hostile environment due to the colleges reputation of being ""the best"". What I found was a head of department (let's call him P) who is an absolute beast at what he does and instead of being stuck up or egocentric, he was very accepting, patient and encouraging. He was just super cool. I instantly fell for it and it made want to learn everything he could possibly teach me. 

In my first year we weren't able to work with him much and we worked with another tutor. She was also like my head of department but a bit less patient (we'll call her L). L wasn't as great a designer or teacher as P but she was still really good in hindsight. I performed really well and I started to gain a reputation for being a talented designer. My classmates were also fantastic and they made me feel like I was somewhere I finally belonged. Throughout my first year it really felt like I was a part of this big family called the graphic design department and I was really really happy to be a part of it.

After sailing though my first two semesters it was time to start my second year. I was hoping to finally be able to work with P and learn his magic. I was instead dealt a very bad hand. It turned out that we weren't going to work with him that much and that we would be working with a new lecturer (let's call her C). I went to C's class thinking that it would be just like the ones I had before. I soon found out that C did not share the same values as P or L. If P and L were hippies then C was like the drill sergeant from full metal jacket.

C demanded that we worked ourselves to the ground. She expected excellence out of everyone in every way. From the way we dressed to the way we spoke, C expected perfect professionalism and character. C's life was her work and she even said her idea of a fun time was being overwhelmed by work. That's fine, but she kinda expected us to be like her. I've always been a very carefree, laid back person and this hit me pretty hard. I started to feel like things were starting to become less about expressing yourself and offering your unique take on things and more about pleasing her and her ideals and standards. 

I still remember the first feedback session I had with her. I went to her confident in my work because I had done well the previous year. When I showed her my work she basically said that everything I did was wrong. I was shattered. I questioned what I had learned and practiced throughout the whole of last year. I spiralled into a lot of self doubt. I tried to turn it around for the next session but the next session went even worse and she accused me of plagiarizing someone else's work when I didn't even know about the local designer I was supposedly plagiarizing. I felt very bad because that's something I'd never even consider doing. She was relentless in her criticism. During this time she also scolded me in front of the whole department about how I was late to class all the time (which nobody gave a fuck about before her). I felt humiliated and felt as if I was back in school which I hated.

I finally succumbed and decided to do my work only to please her. I did everything as she said and she was finally satisfied with something I had done. I also started coming to class on time. 

Things started to become a bit better. I started to get used to delivering what she expected. Things fell into a rhythm and the class became even more united after going through such a shocking begining to the year. Sadly, around this time I got some really horrible news. P decided it was time to leave teaching after ten successful years. The whole class was shocked. He informed us that he would be departing after the end of the year. This decision marked the slow demise of the family atmosphere that I was so enchanted by in the beginning. 

C also started bringing in people from the industry. I noticed that they were all from big advertising agencies. I started asking around about it from my seniors and they explained to me that pretty much everyone just graduates and gets hired by one of these agencies cuz that's really the only place for a graphic designer in the country. 

Me and C thankfully built a good rapport and eventually she trusted me enough to give me leeway to do what I wanted, but only a little bit. I worked hard with her and I think she started to respect me a little. She had also earned my respect because she actually started to help me instead of scolding me about things. She was really good at encouraging people but she rarely did so.  At the end we all conformed to her expectations and we actually became better designers.

While we were working with C we were also working with P in parallel. Since C demanded so much from us P's classes were mostly overlooked. Even P wasn't all that committed. He basically had one foot out the door already and it looked like he was just really tired of going through this again and again. I tried to pick up the few things P ended up teaching us. 

P left at the end of the year and I had lost the person I came to learn from but I became a better designer (top 3 in my class) through C's ruthless oversight. L was chosen to be P's successor even though C  had more experience and was better suited at running the place. 

The college also started to reveal it's true face by upping the monthly price and blaming it on the rising prices of utilities and supplies. I later found out this was a lie and that they just lure you in with a lucrative price only to up it to twice what they said you'd have to pay. I felt cheated by the school because of this and P. 

With P walking out the door, his philosophies and ideals in the department walked out with him. The family was now just a section of the business known as education. This place had morphed into something unrecognizable. I was really upset. Love left the building.

I then went off to an internship. In my internship I discovered that no one really gave a shit about anything else besides everything looking good. If the client was happy, then whatever. Nobody asked me for the intellectual decisions that were made based on research like how C and her advertising buddies so vehemently expected. I was thrown to a loop once again. I literally whispered wtf every time I showed something to a client and they liked it knowing that if I showed this to C she would've murdered me. I started to feel jaded and questioned why the fuck I did any of this.

I returned to college to start the first semester of my last year. I found out that we wouldn't be working with C anymore. Everyone was very confused at first. Instead we would be working with L. There was also a new tutor (call her N) who was alumni but had only graduated three years prior. The whole class felt like she wasn't fit to be a teacher because of how little time she had been working for. L wasn't the same person who taught us in our first year. She had become rigid and uptight. Her feedback and critique also felt unconstructive and we felt uncomfortable with her methods because we had become so used to C's. We all struggled because we were working for L like we were working for C and L was having none of it. L wasn't providing what we expected from her and the whole class decided to launch a complaint about her and N. 

We met the Director of staff/Principal and we told him that L sucks and that we want C back. TBH I didn't really care much for bring C back I just wanted better teaching being done. He told us that they both have contracts and that it would be hard to do so but that he'll try. 

Things kept getting worse with L and finally came to a head when we were assigned a group project. In our last group project C paired us based on our strengths and weaknesses. L and N just randomly paired us. This was a major major mistake. We were all paired with people who DID NOT compliment each other well AT ALL. Instead it was detrimental to each other. We all struggled and we started pointing the finger at each other for our shortcomings. Teammates started to throw each other under the bus and in the span of two months I saw more tears being shed by my friends than I had in two years.  It hurt, I was devastated. 

The last aspect of family or togetherness we had left was destroyed. My class that I was so proud of because we were so tight knit became hostile and cut throat. The dire way I imagined things would be before I joined. 

I will never forget how it felt turning in that group project. Everyone was scrambling to get things finished and it was hectic as hell which is usually during this time. My group thankfully finished all the work early even after our third member went radio silent / AWOL at the last minute and I had to cover a 2/3 of the project. I submitted and went back to my class. What I saw scarred me. I saw my friends yelling at each other, throwing things everywhere and giving each other hostile looks. I felt like I was standing in a warzone. I struggled to acknowledge that this was my class now. I questioned why the hell am I, are we, doing this for? I couldn't take it and went to the beach to relax but I couldn't, the damage was done. I came back to get my things and I saw one of my friends who was probably the most cheerful one in the class bawling her eyes out. L saw it and just ignored it. It showed what kind of person she had become. I felt so broken and betrayed. L and N destroyed the last thing I had left. 

Nothing was the same after that. L had decided that she will be leaving at the midway point of next semester and C effectively became her successor. N was delegated to teaching first years. L chilled out after being relieved of her leadership role and is actually kinda cool now. 

C who hates L, remarked at the horror show she and everyone else saw last semester and gave everyone a fresh start. Everyone was still reeling from the fiasco and nobody treated each other the way that we used to even though things had settled a little. I got very depressed and I started wanting to get away from everything. 

C was now in charge of everything and she expected work that was double what we had done for her last year. She also brought in two other part time lecturers who do nothing but give their opinion on things but it's useless because C always gets the last day in everything. 

I stopped enjoying class and I resented the work I did. I started skipping class for the first time. I wonder what is the point of it all? C started to scold me again and this time she was even more ruthless. She even accused me of having and attitude problem because of a pair of glasses (the kind RDJ wears which makes me feel safe when I feel anxious) which I wore while I went to meet her to genuinely ask for her help. I felt really hurt because I've been nothing but nice to everyone in that godforsaken building. It felt like she was being way too hard on me for nothing and was belly inconsiderate. She did try to help me but what she said earlier stung so much because of my struggle with anxiety that I couldn't think about anything else. 

Whenever I go to class now, the work is never enough and C just gives me an earful of how bad and incompetent it is. It's like back to square one. When she did that last year I would've worked harder but this year it makes me want to do the opposite. It just hurts now when she says those things. I feel like I've gone through enough. 

I tried to meet my school guidance counselor to sort myself out but they didn't reply to my request for help. I took it as another empty promise the school doesn't keep. 

I feel like in these three years I've learned how to be a model graphic design employee coming off the college production belt ready for big advertising. I feel like I never learned true graphic design. I wonder if I even want to be a graphic designer anymore if it means having to become someone like C. 

I wish P and L had stayed and that the department didn't become this toxic.

I'm so close to the end but I feel like giving up now. I don't want to waste the two years I accomplished but I feel like I can't take C's nonsense anymore. I don't know what to do.

So here I am writing this long ass post on Reddit avoiding my work, expecting another belter from C once I get to class again. 

Thanks for reading whoever that did.",28Jul2019,1

112,"My granddad is in his 90s and for the past year or so his health has been deteriorating. He's always been very active and fit and therefore has a hard time accepting that he cant do everything he used to be able to do- I think his mental health is getting worse because of this as well.  

In about a month I am going to fly to South East Asia and will be travelling there for 3 months and I am very afraid that he will die while I'm gone. He means so much to me and I don't know if I'll be able to handle it if he dies while I'm away. And even if he doesn't, next year I will be gone for 4 months as well, what if it happens then? What do I even do if he dies while I'm gone? Fly home, right? And then? Go back and continue travelling or stay home and leave my travel-buddy alone? I have a hard time dealing with all of this, especially because I know he doesn't like us, his grandkids, travelling so much because he lost his own daughter in an accident while she was on vacation and he was stuck at home, even though he knows an accident like that can happen anywhere, even at home.
And I feel bad for going away for so long, especially because 3 out of 6 grandkids will be gone at the same time,  the lengths of our travels varying between 1 and 6 months. 

I normally visit him 1-3 times a week, so the thought that I might not see him again after I leave for this trip, or the other one, is tough. 
I already wasnt present for my mom's death, even though I was home, because I couldn't handle it, I don't really know if I can handle him passing away while I'm not there. 
But at the same time I dont want to put my life on hold, because there's a possibility he might pass away- he obviously will at some point but I don't want to sit around waiting for it. 


I guess there's not really a point to this post, I just needed to vent a little- I don't think I can burden any family or friends with these feelings.",28Jul2019,1

116,"Hello,

I don't know if anyone's going to read this. But if you do, thanks. I also want to note that this is a personal throwaway account. In a way, it's somewhat of a diary. The reason I'm posting this here instead of just keeping it to myself in a regular diary is because I'm afraid that my family will read it again and punish me for it. They don't know anything about my online life, so I'm safe here.

I want to start by giving a little bit of a flashback to my life as a kid.

Let me just start off with the fact that my family is poor and always has been. But I never saw a problem with that, but unfortunately my parents constantly said otherwise.

My parent were and are not the most emotionally stable people.

My Mother is a child that was born out of wedlock, her Father abandoned her, and she sank into poverty with her sister and Mother. So she isn't exactly the most romantic or empathetic person. She is a hollow and selfish woman. I've even noticed her painfully obvious sociopathic tendencies. Needless to say, I feel nothing but disregard for her as a person.

My Father was born within a pair of people who were married, yet his Father was unfaithful to his Mother. He had to witness his older Sisters' and Brothers' degenerate decisions (his brothers knocking up young girls, selling drugs and his sisters were alcoholics and extremely promiscuous). If that's not bad enough, his entire family (exluding his Father; his Father died a while ago) despised him and still do to this day.

My siblings are not the most stable people either. We are the (I would like to hide the number of siblings I have, but we're a lot) most depressed, anxious, and underhandedly violent people I have ever personally met.

I understand that my parents are messed up, but the worst part is that all of the same things their parents did to them -- they do to us!

My Mother had to put up with emotional abandonment and this constant pressure of overtly-high expectations. She does the same to me.

My Father had to put up with the severe sexist comments of the women in his family (men are worthless, men are disgusting, etc. Etc.), which led him to despise women altogether -- or rather, have an extremely negative opinion of them. My Father subjects me to the same treatment (women are worthless, women are disgusting, etc. Etc.). I love my Father, but at the same thing I despise him.

This emotional abandonment and constant attack to my gender has somewhat led me to question my gender. I have somewhat grown to be embarrassed of my body.

I do not identify as a boy, but I do not identify as a girl either. I honestly don't know *what* I am.

And years and years of emotional lashing has led me to be quite aromantic. I *used* to be *so* in love with romance -- but I feel I've grown away from that.

I simply don't feel the same as I used to.

Does anyone know what I could possibly be? Am I a girl or a boy? Or is it bad that I am feeling confused about my gender? I would like honest feedback, if possible.

Thank You for reading, Bye.",28Jul2019,1
117,"I am lost. It's 2pm and I didn't even get out of my bed. 
It happens from time to time. I remember this rate time when I know why do I live but most of the time I am like: what are you doing?

I am 22, programmer, left my country and family, have stable $$ and live in appartment. But I have no idea, who am I, what do I do, why do I live, what I like. I am very hard on myself and hate myself, when I am not doing anything, waisting time, while everyone is having great time, living their lives. I tried to write down my dreams but they motivate me for 5 days top. 
 
I couldn't find good friends and thought I am very good by myself but now think that they could help me to go out, see world, understand what's mine. But I don't know what to do, I am stucked with my problems, with my life and with my huge feeling of sorry for myself (which I also have).

So on r/[trashy](https://np.reddit.com/r/trashy/comments/cit4sz/at_the_amsterdam_gay_pride_someone_from_the/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) there is a post of a person promoting pedo acceptance. 

Here is where I am having trouble, part of LGBTQI+ is that sexuality is something you're born with and as long as you act ethically you should be accepted if not at least able to live you life ""out"". The unethical part of pedophila is acting on it but that doesn't change that it is in born and part of a person's sexuality. 

Yes from a practical perspective I understand the LGBTQI+ policy but from a principle perspective it is not consistent. 

There are predatory bad actors who want pedophilia accepted so they have more cover, but there are others who want it accepted so pedophiles can be out. We can know where they are, they can get better help, feel more part of the community (meaning more accountable to that community). 

If like the lgbtqi+ community keep saying life is better when you can be you, well removing that stress of hiding and fear of being outed means pedophiles would have less things to break their resolve as well.",28Jul2019,0

124,"For as long as I can remember I get tantrums really easily. I always stayed angry for days because I never really knew how to handle my tantrums. When I was younger I used to bite my towels to lose my anger. Or I would scratch my arm till it bled. Or break pens and pencils. 

A year ago I got depression and I started to cut my wrists to feel something since I felt so transparent. When people started to notice my scars I got really reluctant around people. I started to absolutely hate my scars. When I beat depression I decided to cut my ankle every time I wanted to feel something, because ankles are easy to hide. Since the past few weeks when I get tantrums I want to punch something. I wanted to feel my knuckles in pain. One time I got so angry and I didn't know where to punch, so impulsively I decided to punch myself in the face. It felt.. good.. Now every time I punch myself in the face I hope my nose bleeds to see how much strength I can put into dealing with my anger.

I know it's an unhealthy way to lose my anger, but in all honesty, I think it's the only way. At some point it makes me feel alive and makes me aware that I'm a living being, and that makes me satisfied.",28Jul2019,1

128,"Since a week now I'm having constant (yet when I for example go to a party I completely forget about it and it's like it isn't there.) pain in the left area of my chest. It's very difficult to pinpoint a location as it's kind of all around the left side. I've tried reading a little bit on the internet but I learned from previous mistakes not to believe too fast in what the internet says. I'm absolutely terrified, I haven't been to the doctor yet because of fear.

The pain doesn't feel like it's directly something with the heart, when trying to feel my chest with my hand it feels more like it's the skin, not in the inside (though what the hell do I know). I'm starting to feel that my left shoulder is getting stiff little by little. Again, I know the doctor is the best solution for this but I'm... so afraid.
