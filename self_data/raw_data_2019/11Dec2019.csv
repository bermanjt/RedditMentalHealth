And was absolutely appalled. I was sick it was disgusting to think that some grown ass man. Or woman. Gave me an erection as an INFANT and proceeded to amputate the most erogenous part of my body. 20.000 nerve endings lost.

5,"This is strange thing to struggle with, but I 100% cannot have a cat ever. I have always loved animals and done better and better with them as I aged. Because of this, when I was younger my dad told me maybe when I move out he might see about helping me get a cat. I've lived with that for a long time and got excited about it and did research on what I would need and etc. I am older now but have not moved out yet and my circumstances have changed enough that it would be a horrible idea for me to get a cat or really any other pet besides the one I have at this time. I currently own a tarantula and my boyfriend owns a bird so if we stay together long term and end up married which is what looks like is going to happen, there will be no way I will be able to get a cat. We have been talking about a dog recently too but that will be way in the future if it happens. My mother is also allergic to cats and hairless cats tend to be more of a handful. My boyfriend has also told me he would prefer we dont get a cat and I understand why. This would all be fine on its own, but I can't get the idea and wants and everything I had planned out of my head. Its been an ongoing dream for years and years of my life and its hard to let go of. Pets are a huge part of my life and theyve always been important to me.

I hope you find your light. I hope you catch the wind that’s calling your name. I hope you find everything your soul is calling for.


I pray that as you run, you feel the pounding in your heart, that you let that feeling guide you to your next destination. I pray that as you draw in each refreshing breath, you exhale every toxic thing in your life, that you leave behind the ugly world you were living in. I pray that as you blink, you let go of every memory that has wounded you, that you let the devastation fall as tears on your cheeks.

I hope you learn that it’s okay to put your faith into something that’s not tangible. I hope you figure out that it’s a profound gift to be able to see a light in a hole of darkness. I hope you realize that the world is wide open, that it speaks to limitless potential.

I pray that with every unhealthy footstep you leave behind, you replace it with a healthier one, a healthier version of you. I pray that with the desire to release every fading memory, you find the courage to keep them, for they are the foundation of your soul—your being.

13," 

Just writing this to get it off my chest. Really; since I don't have anyone to talk about it.

I'm seeing this guy for like 6 months now (just for sex)... The problem is I got my feelings involved. Classic. And now I'm such a mess.

I know I deserve better, someone who gives me what I want, what I crave, love. I love sex, sex with that guy is amazing but I would love to have someone loving me and sharing a relationship with me. The thing is, before I started seeing this guy, I hadn't have sex in 5 years. And damn, that's hard, you know? And well, I'm with him because of the sex, and because I like him on a physycal level. However, at the same time I feel bad because I feel kinda worthless of love? I don't know.

I don't want to ""break things up"" with him because then I wouldn't even have the sex. And at least I want that, I'm just so confused. And tonight I'm sad because I found out he's seeing another woman (not seriously, just fucking her too), and I just got sad, even though I knew, -I'd imagined-, that he saw other women. Because he's single, and well, a man. And well, to be honest, if I could, I would probably ""see"" someone else too; the problem is I don't have someone else. And it sucks. Being with him hurts me sometimes, but at the same time it makes me feel wanted and beautiful and when we're together he treats me really well.

It just sucks to be me right now.",11Dec2019,1

16,"This is gon be a long one.

Whats up reddit I'm going through yet another mental breakdown, the third one this week. Now before anyone makes any first impressions about me, about six months ago I never said I had depression, never even thought I did, never had a mental breakdown and was overall mentally stable.

I've always had suicidal thoughts at the back of my head. Thats common for a lot of people I've noticed. Anyone who I have opened up with about these kind of things tends to be facing their own thoughts with suicide as well.

In a few weeks everything changed for me. I have no idea why I made this on another throw away because as soon as the people I know read this, they're going to know its me.

I was first cheated on by my girlfriend of 5 years. We were dating through the last few years at school and then as soon as i had to go for a week she got with a guy i had been worried about for months. I had expressed how i felt multiple times but was only gaslighted for mentioning it. Then after it happened i was then gaslighted even more.

Now i never claimed to have depression because everyone has bad days right? Everyone has shitty thoughts right? Although this may be true one would need to keep an eye out for any developments in lower moods. 

However the first thing that was done when i said i thought i might have depression was to have that used against me and used to gaslight me, ""oh if you'd have been honest with me about that i would have been more patient with you"". That one hurt a lot because you usually only hear storys of support and understanding. Not in this situation. An entire group of friends also ghosted me, reassuring me that friends will drop you when you become inconvenient for them.

I was working 70 hours a week at the time and felt most comfortable when working, bevause thats all i had to take my mind off of things. Of thoughts. 

Well after work at one point i had way way way too much to drink, saw the girl I used to talk to everyday and love more than anything, and eventually ended up attempted the big S. Not the first time, not the last. That shit changed me though. Even though i was stopped (tackled to the ground, would not have been talked down) it will stay with you and change you in ways you dont expect. 

My head is completely fucked. I cant remember anything and i cant focus on anything. The amount of mental breakdowns i have a month is astounding.

This was all because of something that happened over a couple weeks. Its now months later and I'm still stuck on what to do.

Can you ever forgive someone for cheating?

Could you ever get back with them after?

Would that even be a good idea?

How can i get back to the point where I didn't want to die every single day?

Is it ever a good idea for someone to commit?

What would the circumstances for that be?

Could i ever get my head to start working right again?

Any answers welcome, experienced or not.

Also don't watch black mirror that shits fucked",11Dec2019,1
17,"Not only do the clients in group homes or clients living on their own usually sorely need furniture, nicer kitchenware, bedding, etc, but the staff bedrooms are usually furnished with whatever staff have been able to add to it over the years. I just donated my old double bed to our overnight staff room... we had 200 pound male workers sleeping in a single bed. Believe me, it's helpful that we can sleep better haha. We don't even have real curtains and the TV is a giant 20 year old tube TV. Obviously we aren't entitled to have a fancy work space or anything, and the clients always have decent stuff when possible. But, if you want to donate some nicer stuff, consider asking non-profits if they need anything for homes or clients. It's super appreciated and at least you know it directly made a difference.

22,"I visited some websites that displayed gore. As I scrolled through the endless rows of images and videos of accidents and murder and suicide, I've realized that humans are incredibly delicate creatures. I found an image of a naked raped woman decomposing after having been found in a lake. She was pale grey and green and came off as slimy, as the sunlight shined extremely bright from her skin and her hair was near-deteriorated, and her eyes were bulging from her head. Her body was puffed up, in an unnatural way. Her expression was blank and stared off into space. It showed pictures of her before and after. She looked so happy in the 'before' photo.

I realized that that we are not invincible, and we rot just like any other animal. We are simply biological products of nature. I know that if someone asked you if you were THAT, you would probably say 'yes.' But having to see other people like her made me realize, forced me to acknowledge that we are not above the laws that define us. 

I don't resent the fact that this has happened and that I have looked and seen all these things. In fact, I visit the website occasionally, out of a feeling of obligation. I was blind to people's suffering before. I visit the website not out of enjoyment, but because I want to see people dying and feeling pain, so that I may share their experience. 

But now I want to stop this suffering. I have been feeling so different these past few months, because I can't attend school or do any daily activity without thoughts of beheadings and rape and torture. It haunts me, and I want to stop it. I'm don't think myself as so naive as to try to make some difference while I'm only 14, but maybe when I'm older, much older, I'll start thinking about what I can do. I want it to be a direct method, maybe involving the death of others, maybe not. But the fact doesn't change that I want to see death and experience anguish and suffering. I want to be overtly sensitive to it, so that maybe, in the littlest thing other people say or do, I can pick up traces of hurt. I can stop it before it grows.",11Dec2019,1

We go to the restaurant and she already has a reservation. Weird, but not too weird. The table had three chairs and that was weird too. Then, about 15 minutes into our date, a guy shows up and sits down with us. The sexy bitch from work introduced him as her boyfriend. He said ""hi, it's so good to finally meet you!"" And then neither of them talked to me much for the rest of the night. She only talked to him and not me. Unbelievable.

The next work day, Monday, I confronted her about it in the breakroom. I said, ""what the hell was that?"" She said ""I don't know, I though maybe you'd want to meet him""

Not gonna lie, it made me attached AF. He’s legit the first perosn I’ve ever met in my life that’s as broken as I am. Like our stories are vastly different but the end result is so fking similar.

28,"I’ve been trying for a majority of my life to understand why I like certain stories more than others, so far to no avail. For me, it’s not as simple as just understanding the genre or tropes it has. Because every time I use that method to try to find more, it fails. It pisses me off that I can’t figure out what it is about the stories that I like that stand out, because it would be so easy to find more like it and recreate the euphoria I get every time I experience it. But since I don’t, I have major lows in my life because I can’t find a story or song that speaks to me, and I begin to think that the reason I like what I like is nothing more than a random whim with no deeper meaning, rather than a specific element. I’ve been trying to figure out for so long the core elements of my favorite things so I could finally understand my preferences.

Life doesn’t seem to carry any definite meaning to me. It feels like one of the only reasons I continue to enjoy it is the euphoria I get from stories or music that I love, and the desire to recreate it somehow. I live for it.

Regarding stories, I like cartoons and anime. I like to think that when you are not restricted to looking at things through the lenses of real life, you have the freedom to make whatever draws you in. That’s one of the main reasons I prefer fiction over nonfiction. The end goal, for me, is a certain emotional (maybe intellectual?) experience which is a lot easier to recreate through fiction. 

When a cartoon jumps the shark, it’s common for me to want to discuss with my family how it changed, and what core elements made the show as good as it was before, that are no longer present. It excites me when I do this because I often think that I could use these core elements in my own creation. When I say core elements, I don’t mean something specifically in the plot, or a particular art style or joke, but rather a general theme of storytelling or presentation that could be taken away from these things and applied to any cartoon/story. I love doing this, but my family almost never wants to talk about it beyond maybe once for 30 mins or one YouTube video or something. It baffles me because I assumed that most people liked doing this sort of thing. 

This lead me to get into personality typing. I’ve been obsessed with the mbti for the past few years trying to understand my type, thinking I’m an intuitive type because of these thoughts that run through my head that are weird to the people around me. What I realized is that I am merely trying to use the mbti to explain away these seemingly strange thoughts about cartoons (and anime), which goes in line with my desire to understand the things I like. Where a problem arises is when I don’t relate to other aspects of intuitive types that are irrelevant to my thoughts, like predicting the future or having strong beliefs or values or consistent logical prowess (for the sake of simplicity I’m stereotyping a bit). I try to use this one part of personality typing to explain my thoughts, while disregarding everything else, and when the other things don’t add up, I second guess myself. That’s why I haven’t been able to figure out my type. Because what I’m looking for and what the mbti gives me are two different things.

Now, focusing on anime, it’s somewhat similar to cartoons. One thing that upsets me, is that a lot of anime look the same on the surface. This makes it hard to find anime that I like without looking at each one, which is very time-consuming. I might really like one anime and notice another one that looks almost exactly the same (art style, genre and everything) but ends up boring or irritating me. I can’t explain the trend I’ve noticed that anime, for me, is either a complete hit or complete miss, but it’s not my focus. A good anecdote is my experience in my anime club in college. When picking an anime to watch, a lot of the ones that weren’t comedies had the same theme of darkness and edgyness (I used to think I just liked edgy stuff, but it doesn’t seem to be the case). I’m not trying to say that the anime I like is objectively better or anything, but I wish people took more time to understand the core elements that make the shows that I like stand out and why I personally like them for it. When I show my family anime I like, they’re quick to judge it or laugh at it for little things that don’t relate to the core themes or styles present in the anime (saying an anime is bad because it has unnecessary violence, minor plot holes, or anime tropes). I tried to show my brother an anime that started off with a suicide, and he got so disgusted that he stopped before getting even halfway through the first episode. This alone wouldn’t be a problem if he just said that he didn’t want to watch it because that kind of thing made him uncomfortable, but he had the gall to call it bad storytelling because it started off that way even though was just the beginning of the first episode! There was so much more I wanted to show and talk to him about related to the anime, and he had to judge it based on that one thing. Basically what pisses me off is when people hyperfocus on little details they notice about an anime and judge it off that and make no effort to evaluate the overall themes present or try to find positive storytelling elements that can be taken away. I have a lot of anime I love that I would love to talk about with people but I’m certain that whoever I talk to is going to thin slice it immediately based on details that stand out to them, when I ignore it for the sake of the overall idea. I understand people have different tastes, but I just don’t think that’s the way to evaluate an anime. Another problem with that is that details are a lot easier to pinpoint and a lot easier to articulate for others to understand, so people who rely on that get to spin whatever narrative they want.

Idk, there was more I wanted to let out, but I think I’ll just end it there. I’m not even sure I’m if I’m posting on the right sub. I might be totally wrong and completely misguided in my interpretation, but I just don’t have anyone to confide in for this sort of thing. Considering I didn’t put much effort trying to structure this in a user-friendly way, I don’t expect many people to read any of this. I expect people who do to either not care about the topics I brought up, judge me, or tell me I’m overthinking and need to find a new hobby. I doesn’t matter, I already know I’m a freak in one way or another, and while that alone doesn’t bother me, it irritates me that all these thoughts banging against my skull fall on deaf ears every time I try to get it out.

But hey, I’m a pretty fickle person who seems to live by his emotional whims, so I’m sure I’m going to look back at this a bit later and cringe a bit, but I felt that this needed to be expressed.",11Dec2019,1

35,"Hello all.

I am in my late thirties and saw help from a psychiatrist for the first time in 2016. I have gone through a lot of tough times throughout my life and all things considered managed to be a good person all the way through. To give you an idea of who I am, I graduated high school, worked a year and a half and saved all that I could to open a then successful IT business. I had people doubting me then and funny enough is also the reason for this post. That doubt.

Fast forward, my company’s doors close and I went to work with one of my suppliers. Went to school in the evenings and graduated college. The grind was real. Writing this all and seeing my accomplishments made me happy. I never share or humble brag. Just know I actually appreciated myself for a second there.

This year I had to take half of it off to focus on me. I cannot tell you if I have landed at the bottom of this pit but I’m here not giving up. I went back to work starting July and feel like I have lost respect of those around me. My work colleagues are aware that my absence was due to my depression. My work place isn’t the trusties of places. Managers constantly divulging personal information on employees and word gets out quickly. Regardless of how shitty that is I feel a little lost these days. It’s just me and my wife. I’m grateful for her and want to improve. I just find sometimes my mind gets caught on these little petty details and I make it about me. I hope I have the patience and will to see this through. I had to take 4 days off at the end of November and was not allowed to use up my vacation time because it wasn’t planned. I had to get a doctors note for my absence and it’s just hard not to be stronger right now. This time of year is usually the hardest for me.

I don’t know what I’m looking for posting here. I just wanted to share enough so if anyone else out there was going through something similar - here is me. I am considered someone my employer can lean on and not being there has been hard for them, no doubt. I know I have let them down in one way but my team is big enough to shift responsibilities around. When I got back in the summer I made a promise to myself to bring the best of me and I feel like I have. My colleagues noticed I was better and back to my usual self. As I keep walking down this road called life the way people feel about me seems to change often. I’ve always been independent and a person who prides himself in doing the best that I can, always. This life is moving at a thousand miles an hour most days and waiting to get better is not an option anymore. I see a need to do more with myself but need to figure out how. My mind scares me sometimes. I want to take that emotion and turn it towards the outside.

52,"TL;DR- bout to be kicked out because i keep missing work but i (think) i have real mental illness and am not sure what's real anymore

So, i have been stuck at home, on anti-depressants(zoloft) and anti-psychotics(risperdal) since i was 17 (im 23 now [6 yrs]). Im on disability (diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic) But recently, 5mos. ago my mom found a great guy who has really been the daily father figure i never really had. He has like three dgrees in psychology and is retired now. He has really helped us and i got my first job 3 mos ago at a grocery store because of him. He even contributed to my first car! Which is huge! That has been a goal of mine since i got my license (when i was like 19). But now i find myself dreading going to work and often tell myself i'd rather die. I really dont think i want to die as i really like my friends and family so i basically have alot of people/things to live for. But still i feel unfulfilled to the point where i fall asleep telling myself to kill myself and wake up just wanting to sleep.. like to the point where whatever consequences happen seem better than getting out of bed. Ive kinda identified this as like lack of maturity/discipline but in my defense i really think i have a real mental illness. (I was also diagnosed severely depressed before the shiz. diag). Im not sure, im typing this kind of calmed down hours after getting worked up and crying talking to parents. Thats the depression anyway.. the schizophrenia makes me cringe as im not sure if i even am or not as it was caught early on (17) and immediately got on meds and got sober (mainly weed, still drink with friends) when i was 18. The jist of it is i thought i was like famous and being watched on like a weird truman show type thing. I still see signs constantly which i guess is the illness so its really hard to rule out. So ive been going uphill and ignoring paranoid suspicions. My Dr. lowered the anti-psychotic to 3mg (from 6) by my request (he kept it at 6 but put it within my power to take it once a day instead of twice) as things were going really well for me up until like the last 2 weeks. My parents want to put me in public housing but i have no idea what thats like or if it would just be worse enough to actually get me to off myself. This is the text i sent after our talk/argument/breakdown.


*start text*
Im scheduled thursday and saturday. I will aim to go but im not sure i can guarantee it.. i have been looking into public housing in the area but the website tool is really shitty. I think i would qualify but i have no idea how the whole waiting list or whatever works. I dont think i want to die but i really dont want to go to work.. i honestly wanted to try the music stuff..obviously not crazy big super star but start small.. i already found a guy who does mixing and mastering for cheap so i was going to try to make my first song and then send it to him and pay to have him master it.ive been working some on it but will try to spend more time on it if i can.. im still not sure what harm im doing living with you guys. Yes i lied about having the day off but i knew you guys would react that way.. your initial reaction seemed calm and ok and then when you got home you got sick? Or physically ill? I mean is that my fault or did [blank] influence that reaction? I dont know. i dont know what he said when you got here..  i dont know how to deal with mentally ill people or especially be the parent of them so im not sure what the right reaction/steps are..still the whole kicking out of the house thing? Im not sure how that correlates me missing work.. i still have income so i can still contribute to housing costs.. i have been here my whole life and [blank] has been here for 5 months and he has seniority of my arrangement.. i am open to his wisdom but i dont see how kicking me out is helpful for anyone but you guys.. he often says i have been manipulating you but right now based on his attitude and talking to you in private mid-conversation? i feel like he no longer wants whats best for me or is angry and just wants to punish me.. if im missing something please fill me in.. i want things to go well for all of us and i do want to be out of your hair but i really dont think i will be able to hold a job or finish school. So i dont know what to do.

67,"Over the past 8 or so months I have been a part of several subreddits that are particularly toxic and negative. I'm absolutely tired of scrolling through my feed and seeing all of these negative stories, opinions, and information. 

I honestly think a lot of reddit is toxic and negative. There are entire subreddits dedicated to putting down others and getting your incredibly close-minded opinion out there. I'm also tired of seeing stories about people who have shitty lives.  Of course I feel bad for them, no one should have to be raised in an awful environment or go through a lot of the crap I see on reddit. 

I am happy with my life and find no reason to create a negative space or a negative mindset that, ultimately, effects me. In being a member of these toxic subreddits , I have found that I have been posting more negative things, engaging in negative discussion, and incorporating negativity in my regular life. 

I am done with negativity, and want to continue down the positivity train where I was many months before.

On a kinda related note, I have found that when you are in a community that has the same belief, the ideas that are passed around are a bit...stronger...than usual. Members of these communities engage in conversations together and because they all generally have similar interests, discussion isn't as diverse and complex as it is in every day life. If you comment regarding an opposing view to the general ideas of the community, you are often downvoted to hell. Members of these communities can reinforce each others' beliefs to the point where it bleeds into everyday life. That definitely happened to me, but luckily I was able to see it before it truly took a toll on my life.

I really like this subreddit. The community is generally pretty positive, but even on negative posts I see people commenting support, advice, and positive vibes. Opposing views are also accepted with an open mind and I've seen some great discussions on here.

Thank you for listening to me.

69,"Sorry if this is badly written, I cant see very well through the tears.

I just woke up from my first false awakening loop, and I’m feeling fucking terrified and questioning reality, but I don’t have anyone I’m comfortable with to talk about it, with so I figured I’d come here. Please note, I do not take any drugs or drink or have any sort of diagnosed illness, and this has never happened before so I’m not sure if my reaction is appropriate.
I stayed home from school today because I did not get much sleep the night before (admittedly, before going to sleep I did have a strong stroke of paranoia). I decided to go back to sleep around 7:35 am, after setting an alarm for 10. I will clarify before I talk about the dream that I have not had nightmares for years until now, I’m never in my own body/life in dreams (not since I was a young child), I’ve been dreaming semi-lucid for my whole life (I can properly think, and decide my one actions actively, but cant fly or change the dream scenario), and have been using a method of getting myself out of dreams I don’t like/waking myself up for years, and it’s never not worked for me.

The dream started out pretty confusing, and originally I thought I was still in that between-consciousness state you feel before you start dreaming. I remember feeling paralyzed in my bed, but blinking with droopy eyes to see my real life room in front of me. (To describe, I sleep on the side of my bed not touching my wall, and am facing a wall when I sleep about a metre in front of me. I always sleep this way.) At this point I wasn’t really stressing, just telling myself to just go to sleep already, and I closed my eyes tight to aid it. 
I then remember waking up in a somewhat different position, this time facing more upwards so I could see a bit of the window above my head. It was dark outside, which already confused me, since when I went to bed the sun had already come up. From my bed I could here rustling and a fan like sound as well, which is weird because I sleep alone in my room, and I don’t have a fan. I could move this time, so I covered myself up in my covers and started using that method I talked about earlier to get me out of dreams, since I didn’t want to spend a dream in my own life and honestly the fact it was even ‘proposed’ kind of scared me. I felt myself waking (the noises were still playing though), and then I started hearing the sound of a string instrument playing. 
The next time I woke up in a dreary office type place I cant really recall ever seeing, and thought I’d finally made it into an actual dream this time. I walked forward to look in a room a bit in front of me, but felt a looming feeling on my back, so decided to first check behind me. Behind me stood a man and a woman, likely in their teens since they didn’t look very mature. Even though I only glanced at them for a second, I remember the man was a white man taller than the woman, with a scrawny build and brown curly hair on top of his head. I’m torn between the woman having brown or blonde hair currently, but I can’t remember any of her other features besides she was smaller than the man and had a cheeky look to her I guess, even though both their vibes felt horrible and just wrong. They stood next to each other in very neutral lifeless poses, and I can’t remember them having any sort of facial expression now. I didn’t take much time to observe them before walking to the reservation desk low on the floor, which was in their direction; ignoring my original quest to enter the room that was in front of me. I didn’t look at the receptionist, but straight down to the sign in paper on her desk (which was just a blank piece of printer paper, with names scribbled on it), grabbing a pen to write my name on it. That’s when the idea popped into my mind to check the other names in this list to find out the man and woman’s names (I should clarify, they were definitely not waiting in line to sign in, so I figured their names had to already be on the sheet.). I scanned through the ‘names’ ,(they were written in all sorts of languages, combinations of languages, random scribbles, just a bunch of numbers, etc; I remember specifically stopping to look at a ‘name’ that was three characters written in some sort of language that was a combination of korean and chinese) until I eventually stopped on a code of a bunch of numbers which I immediately knew belonged to the man for whatever reason, and thought to myself about how entertaining it would be when I wake up to try to decipher what the number combo stood for. I first tried to memorize it, but I just wasn’t able to for whatever reason. This is when I took out my phone without thinking to write in it my notes (like I always do in real life when I find something cool), and realized that something still wasn’t right here (at this point I also realized how absurd it was to think what I wrote in a dream would transfer into my awake life, or even that it would be legible). I’ve never ever in my life had a dream where my technology or any sort of technology was present, and even though I’ve thought about using my phone, it’s never been there. This is when I decided that I had to wake up this exact second or something bad was going to happen. I could also no longer feel the presence of the man and woman behind me, but felt their stare only get stronger on me.

Another customer screamed in my face once and said “I don’t care what you think” when I told him it was rude to call my other co worker the R slur. She wasn’t doing anything wrong.

73,"This is the part 2 to the first post, since the story was getting very long. I’ve finally stopped crying, so I’ll try to write this a bit better. Pt1: https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/e981s2/i_just_got_out_of_my_first_false_awakening_loop/?

Anyways, I felt myself fade out the office dream and into a black space (pretty common), where I reflected on my previous experience, how this was going to be a funny story to tell once I woke up, and somehow realized that the man’s name was Jimmy, or Jim. I found myself worrying about the women’s name though, since it did not come to me like Jimmy’s did. 

I ‘woke’ to find my room in front of me again like it had been before, and got up out of bed to talk to my mother about it (she sleeps just down the hall, and admittedly I was feeling a bit more scared now that I was ‘awake’, and needed to rant to someone about my experience.). I did not think at this time to check the brightness out my window, and instead just kind of accepted my house was nearly pitch black and silent. 

I walked down the hallway to my mother’s room, (she was also getting some extra rest) deciding to call the girl for the time being ‘Clara’ since she gave me that vibe, and opened the door to my mom’s room to see my mom asleep in her bed. This is when everything just immediately faded to black on me before I could wake her up, and I found myself in my bed once again.

This time I could hear the sounds that played in my second dream; the fan, string instrument, and this time more of a scratching sound. I was paralyzed with droopy eyes again, but couldn’t help but fear complete horror for whatever was under my bed, (the opening was right next to me face, pretty much) but couldn’t see below me to check. I lifted my eyes up to their limit to look at the roof, and observed my room breaking apart and blackhole-like voids all over my room, along with grotesque black sludge with littering of eyes inside it. At this point I could feel myself physically crying in the dream, while I furiously tried to wake myself up for real. In closing my eyes and forcing myself to sleep, the dream disappeared and I was finally feeling as if I was going to wake up.

I awoke in my room, immediately checking that it was bright outside (it was), and felt actual relief in my body realizing I could move, it was silent, and that nothing was wrong so far. I finally decided to sit up in my bed, but that was when I realized an irregularity with my room. The upper wall inside my room I had covered with many pictures, ranging from drawings to family photos; which I have looked at multiple times in my life to calm myself down and remind myself that I have done things and that people care about me. One of the papers on the wall was a swatch for when I got my first set of alcohol markers at 12, and though I had never really looked at it before, I recognized somehow that it was missing. 

I threw myself back under the covers at the moment, literally yelling to myself to wake up, and cowering under my covers. I felt my consciousness behind my eyelids, and ripped them open for the light in my window to shine in my eyes. 

I took a quick glance around my room (it was fine now)and raced downstairs to find my mother sitting in her chair like she usually likes to, going through her phone. I think this is when I recognized that this world felt more real then the other’s had been, even if they were also extremely real feeling. I felt breathing and heartbeat for once (which I only then realized I hadn’t felt before in the other dreams). I sat on the ground in front of her (nearly in tears, mind you), and told her that I had had a bad dream. She didn’t bother asking, which made me sure that this was real. I asked her what time it was, and it was now only 8:15, an hour since I had fallen asleep.I’ll spare you the rest details of our conversation (unimportant, but I didn’t tell her what happened), and I raced into the bathroom where I proceeded to cry for the next 20 minutes about how unfair it was for my dream world I held so fondly to fuck with my mind like that, and question if I really was conscious over and over again. 

This is just a rant I wasn’t really sure else to put, but thanks if you read all this way. Looking back on this story, I doesn’t feel nearly as scary as how I reacted to it, but I honestly am really curious what this means or why it happened. I tried googling it, but nothing really gave me any comfort anyways. I’m kind of questioning my sanity right now, to be honest as well.",11Dec2019,1

85,"So I've had it for 12 years which was roughly the same time I developed a tumor near a set of nerves that lead up to my neck on the same side I get my T on. I noticed whenever I woke up and the room was quiet my T was gone and it pissed me off because I had no idea why it kept rapidly coming back whenever I was upright (eg walking, on the computer or at my desk). I remember lying down for hours and it not fading out, while some nights, especially the nights where I was very tired or took sleeping pills, it'd go away shortly after I got in bed and lied down. Then one day I fainted because I ate too much food and got up to quick to do chores and before I passed out my T in the affected side got super loud which made me wonder if it's not ear related at all but to do with wonky blood flow.  

I had MRI scans and everything to rule out Meniere's or a brain tumor and was put on anti schizophrenia drugs to try and make my T quieter to not much success. I kept getting fluid buildup in my right ear sometimes so they thought it was that but my symptoms were still there when there wasn't any. I even cut out MSG and caffeine.

Long story short I found out I'm not sleeping right and I'm constantly tense so my neck and back are tense like I'm standing upright while I'm in bed and I only unclench my muscles when I pass out/go to sleep. So for the past 2 nights I've been actively relaxing all my muscles since the tensing up is habitual/instinctual, especially my neck muscles and the T in my right ear fades out in like half an hour. But if I tense my muscles it starts to return. 

Something to do with capilaries or blood flow and a tense neck = restricted blood flow. My T went away quickly after lying down after I took sleeping pills because sleeping pills promote muscle relaxation. 

I've slept like a baby for the past 2 days

but god damn am I stupid for not figuring this out sooner

86,"My morning routine consists of waking up, getting dressed and walking to my favorite coffee shop. The part I don't tell people is that every day since June I have stopped at the liquor store along the way, and picked up a couple of tall boys for when I get home. I'm not sure what it was, but something hit me this morning and I decided to keep walking and went right past the liquor store and straight to get my coffee.

87,"You place in front of them one pencil, and call it “A”, and then you place two pencils next to each other, and call it “B”.
You ask which they would choose.
If they choose A, they aren’t selfish.
If they choose B, then they are selfish.
If they choose both, then they are selfish as fuck, and just want everything.
If they choose B, then you say, well you can keep B as it is, or move one pencil to A, and keep A.
This is how complex the human mind is.

If they choose to keep B as it is, then they are selfish, based on survival.

If they move one from B, and move it to A, but choose B, they are selfish, but give away what they consider excess, based on necessity, so they are selfish at first, but then they aren’t.

If they move one from B, to A, and choose A, they are selfish, or come off as selfish, but really aren’t, they just take because they think they need more than they actually do.",11Dec2019,1

89,"I hate myself.  I have never had the courage to say this out loud to anyone but I feel it every day.  The problem is if I say it to anyone then they will feel compelled to help out.  I am not a burden, I am the one helping others.  I do not want this to “become a thing” where everyone talks to me like I am a 5-year-old with ways to help.  Oh, I should go out more?  I should hang out with friends more? Thanks for the nothing advice. 

I have never been confident in myself.  Around work and home, I show fake confidence.  It is like I have a wrestling persona.  I grew up watching wrestling and learned how to show this around everyone but as soon as I am alone I hate myself again.  Because of my fake confidence and joking persona, I become the but of a lot of jokes.  “He can take it.” “You are always so happy”.  This past year though it has been showing some cracks.  People are constantly asking what is wrong because I am quiet.  I just don’t want to be hyper all the time because of how I am feeling.

The one plus I have is that I will never physically hurt myself.  Have I wanted to in the past? Of course.  But I know I wouldn’t.  Its not for my own benefit though, its because I work with children.  I will never be selfish enough to emotionally scar hundreds of children because I hate myself.  They know me as a fun-loving guy.  I would not want to shatter that for them.  My job is my life.  I bury myself in work to stop from feeling.

I hate myself for many reasons.  The first is my weight.  I know that this is fixable but I just am not motivated.  I will work out and lose around 10-20 and then one bad day and I end up back where I started because of the slope.  I have always had body issues though.  I would get picked on without mercy and started wearing clothes that are too big for me to cover it up.  I look back and see how fit I was but I never saw it at the time.  I know I have these issue but have had them for over 20 years now its just part of me.  Thud also hurts my personal life too.  I never feel like I am good enough in a relationship and that is because everyone I know and see will tell me I am with a girl out of my league.  Are they generally to good-looking for a guy that looks like me? Sure but saying over and over again to me sucks.

I’m a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way .  When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I Looked to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley quiet way which confuses me because she gave me a furrowed eyebrows snobby look at me when she first called me over to the appointment which got me down

96,"Ok to start, I know nobody is perfect and nobody will 100% be the person you expect them to be, especially in a relationship. But I feel like I can't even remotely have enough in common with someone to develop a serious connection, with exception of a few extremely close friends, who both live too far away from me to see me more than twice a year.

For one, I'm mostly into women. Recently I took to the lesbian label but I realized more recently that I'm not even 100% sure of my sexuality and maybe its best for me to not label it. But primarily, I'm attracted to women.

But I don't feel like any women are attracted to me. The few who are, I don't feel attracted to whatsoever. I try to force myself to be interested and give them a chance but there is no connection.

Secondly, musical taste. Music is a huge part of my life but admittedly my tastes are stuck in a different era. When I talk about my love of certain bands, most girls my age either have no interest or have never heard of them. I see what the majority of girls these days are into and I'm just not on the same wavelength. I have tried to listen to it and have made an effort to enjoy it but I just don't like new music. And because of my efforts I don't blame others for not liking what I like too. There really aren't many girls in my area who will sit and listen to ELO or Thin Lizzy with me all day.

A lot of girls my age like to get out and party and drink, or sit at home and smoke weed and play video games, and I again have made an effort to enjoy these things too but, I don't. I do like going out and walking around the city or staying home and drawing, but not many people consider that fun.

I don't like many shows or movies and I'm not really involved in any fandoms so I can't really connect on those levels either. Again, I've tried. I made a major effort to get involved in the Star Wars fandom a few years ago to get new friends but I lost interest. I've tried getting into Anime, Harry Potter, Riverdale, Dr. Who, Sherlock, I just lose interest so quickly. The only things I really like that have large fandoms are South Park and Bojack Horseman, but even with those I get ""Ew, South Park is so stupid"" and ""Whats Bojack Horseman?"" Again, haven't really connected to anyone regarding those shows. The few I do talk to about them just fall off.

I just feel kinda hopeless. I don't want to be alone but I can't find anyone who I feel a connection with. I just feel bored with trying, like its better to be alone than to force myself to be someone I'm not just to seem interesting enough to be around.",11Dec2019,1

I always think that the worse things are gonna happen between us, but saying those things out loud or writing them, helped me understand its pretty dumb to stress about that, and I feel better, after 24 years of constant anxiety. 

On top of that, I am starting to fall into depression. I'm in couple with a guy, and I have never liked anyone like this before. Now he's just in a bad moment of his life, and he's used to deal with his problems by himself, so doesn't want help.
The beginning of our relation was so sweet and romantic, but now it is different, we don't text everyday anymore and I just realized that it is completely normal. There is still some distance between us at the moment, but he insisted that I should not be scared or anxious about that, and that everything will be fine. What I just did by writing all this stuff, is what helped me. Anxieties makes you think about the worse things and gives you pessimistic thoughts, but once you write those things down or say them out loud, you realize it's pretty dumb to stress about that.

There are a lot of musicians out there that make amazing music. I was searching through soundcloud, and it startles me, to hear such good music... and to see that these people have very few plays on the song. In some cases I was the FIRST to listen to it! There are so many promotion companies trying to actually make money off of these people! **They approach these artists with promises of people hearing their music!** There is so much good music out there that the market has become saturated. Companies have realized that there is a lot of money to be made from these artists that want to be heard.

My goal is to create a community of people, that actually listen to each others music. Sure there is [r/ThisIsOurMusic](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThisIsOurMusic/) but check it out! There are so many posts with not a single comment or upvote. And the same reality is true for [r/soundcloud](https://www.reddit.com/r/soundcloud/). People who promote themselves do just that! Then they leave! They have little/no interest in listening to other peoples music! If we could change that, we could make a powerful statement. **If self promoters acted as listeners as well, we would all listen to each others music**, instead of listening to the music someone paid a company to TELL us to listen to...

I created [r/IndieMusicFeedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieMusicFeedback/) for this purpose!

To put it simply, IMF is a community for musicians to give each other feedback! There is a 3 comment requirement before people are allowed to post their own music. **With the 3 comment - 1 song system, they will be 3 times more likely to get feedback there!!**

Having the opportunity to have their music listened to by a real person, is so valuable today, that artists could pay a promo company 100's of dollars, and they still might not have a real person listen. Just bots and fake comments! IMF on the other hand, provides real listeners, and all they have to do is give 3 other people their time!

Since creating the page, I have spent countless hours listening to music that is being promoted there. Well over 1,800 of them. Whenever I run into a song that blows me away, I am sure to add it to a playlist! I'd love to share the music that I have found with everyone here!

SO I am asking you guys to give these artists a shot, they have very few plays on their music, and I really feel like people are missing out on them! It would also be awesome if a few of you music lovers could jump over to [r/indiemusicfeedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiemusicfeedback/), and give some attention to these artists that are just starting out, or have been around for a while. It really means the world to them that you give their music a chance.

I am also asking advice, on how I can bring the general public to the page. I have created a place for musicians to give each other a shot, but is there a way to bring people who are just interested in listening to the music? Thanks to anyone who is willing to help out or is able to offer advice.
