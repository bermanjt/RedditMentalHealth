I’ve known Caroline(27F) for two years. She used to be an addict and in and out of rehab for years. She used to do heroin and drink every day of the week. She works part time and has a trust fund to support her she’s 27 years old. She started smoking weed again at first I didn’t comment but during the summer she quit her job because it was too stressful and doing nothing but smoking. I tried to show my concern then but she shifted blame saying I’m cheap about gas money and don’t know what I’m talking about. That was around my birthday and she ignored me on my birthday. 




Caroline told me she'd not going to AA anymore because it's a ”Christian cult” I just said something like talk to other people about it and see their opinion and she got all defensive and was like ”i don't need others opinions only me and my therapist make that call I've been hundreds of meetings I don't relate I'm not a real alcholic” 

I was just trying to say maybe try different meetings or see what other people think but I didn't disagree like ”oh no you need to go to meetings” because I know that's not always the answer. It's hard to know what to say because sometimes I feel crazy like ”am I being rude” because she says I'm blunt but I feel I try to be sensitive to other people 


now she's all mad and ignoring me. she drank back in July and was like ”that wasn't a relaspe”And saying stuff like she's not a real alcoholic because she didn't black out.


Idk do I sound like I was being too judgemental idk how to handle that? Why is she so mad at me? Am I being too blunt?

tl;Dr: My friend with addiction problems told me she's not going to AA anymore. I tried to discuss other options and I'm concerned cause she's been smoking weed and drank in July. She got angry at what I said and is now ignoring me.",23Nov2019,1
1," Employeesat a 14th street Union Square New York City Trader Joe's store asked to checkmy bag and accused me of shoplifting today. I refused, they called the cops andan emt ambulance on me with their cell phones and told me to never come back to their store today even though I didn't steal anything. I finally showed them my bag when the cops arrived, they saw I did not steal anything and still accused me of shoplifting and told me never to come back to their store again. I am lucky to not be in a jail or psych ward after this incident and wonder if I have been a victim of discrimination. Is there an organization I can make a  
complaint to? Thank goodness there are other Trader Joe's nearby that I can go  
shopping at hopefully without a similar experience.",23Nov2019,1
2,"I have been feeling empty and lonely these days, started doing bad habits and these voices I hear inside my head aren’t stopping talking to me, either to blame myself or to justify how much I needed doing that.. until I figured out that I have an unhealthy relationship with ME.. always guiding me towards bad things.. I now am thinking that this is all delusional and it will go away as soon as I get bored or lonely, but THIS is itself a result of this unhealthy relationship.. thinking this way, that I can’t change myself, is unhealthy.. and the journey is gonna be tough though to establish a healthy way of thinking..

Just barely made it as of this moment. Despite rent, property taxes and this month's bills. About $50 to spare.  Won't be definitely beyond (a few hundred dollars) until next month or so. And then I can relax. Not be so frugal. Can spend a little more money on things from then on.",23Nov2019,1

Pain radiates into both arms and sometimes my fingers feel like they’re being shocked. I went to ER bc I was getting myself worried. They ran EKG, chest X-ray and took blood and it all came back clean.this passed month I have put on 10 pounds and haven’t really changed my lifestyle which is pretty healthy. Is it possible this could all be related to stress? At first I thought it could be but as these pains and symptoms get worse my mind things otherwise.",23Nov2019,1
5,"This will be my first post. I don’t really know how anything works so it may get taken down but I don’t really care about that. No one has to read this and honestly I don’t expect anyone to either. It is just a way for me to pretend I can talk to people. I know I can, my whole life I have grown up knowing there are people around me that loves me and supports me but right now, it doesn’t feel like it at all.

I have ben in a rough patch lately, my sister has been a nightmare to live with, me and my mother have had issues with her needing money and I will have to give everything I have to her so we can afford food and stuff. I go to school but not doing what I want to do, one of my best friends are having a really though time and I feel so helpless about it. 

My other friends live out of town and I never get to see them. I spend all my time locked in my room alone and I have nothing to do and I am super social but I can’t do anything and I am so shy and anxious so I can’t just go online and talk to people or go someplace and meet other, I can’t do large groups and the one friend I have close just tells me it’s alright and that he will help and then does absolutely nothing. I join their group chat as they play on ps4 and he doesn’t even introduce me so I sit there in silence for a couple of hours until he leaves and I will have to awkwardly leave too because I haven’t said anything and have no reason to be there when he is gone. 

I don’t play any games anymore because no one wants to play with me. They just say ‘oh yeah we need to play’ and then they just put it off and shit. I have a boyfriend also out of town he is quite reserved and not good with feelings so I can’t really lay it all out on him either. Not that I want to lay it out on anyone, I am just so lonely and I don’t know what to do. 

I try to keep myself from talking to people because once I start to open up about to my friends I feel like they just try to change the conversation and all that. And I am open to hearing what I do wrong myself and I am quite open about everything, not to the weird point but you know. If people ask or the setting is right I don’t have a problem with sharing. And when I first start talking to people they are super supportive and then they just leave. And I never get to know what I do wrong because no one ever tells me.

 And I feel like this is some kind of bullshit. How can everyone try to avoid me? How can no one answer my question and I give myself to everyone who needs it and listen to what they have to say and I love to do it. I have no problem with being around and helping people get stuff out but how come there is not one single person that would want to listen to me? 

I have been lucky. I have had many people around me and I know I have been a pain in the ass for some of them but we have always been good friends nonetheless. I just don’t know what to do.

 I will move out soon hopefully if everything goes smoothly and I hope for everything to calm down when I don’t have all that family shit up my ears all the time. I’m just so lost at the moment. 

There is so much now. I don’t know where to go. I am not mad at anyone, I am just tired and lonely. I don’t have any way to make new contacts and meet new people, this is way out of my comfort zone but I really don’t know where to go at this point. 

I know I just need to get my shit together but I just needed to get it out, even if no one is reading and I totally understand that. But I can pretend now at least that someone will read this and if you have, thank you. This is probably not the place to go for this and if it gets deleted it’s fine again. But yeah. Thanks for any advice there is ofc more but I feel so worn out about everything and I feel super stupid for just going this far with it. My self esteem is at the bottom and I don’t feel like I have nothing to loose. At least I got some miles out of my comfort zone. Thanks again",23Nov2019,1
8,"Hi all, im 20 years old for reference

A little background story, my weight has fluctuated throughout my pre teens, teens and young adulthood. Pre-teen i was very very heavy and was teased alot for it and was very self conscious of my weight, but then i got really tall and skinny, and remain pretty skinny to this day.

Now, i have never been on a diet, never made myself vomit after eating to make myself not hold the food, nor do i think im massively overweight.

Every time i am unwell (vomiting/ diarrhoea) i get super happy, i hope to myself that the sickness lasts a long time, because it makes my stomach extra flat.

I also have TRIED but been unsuccessful at making myself vomit, ive tried with my fingers and various ways i have googled online to do this but failed.

I think to myself, if i could physically make myself vomit, that i would definitely be bulimic, no question about it, i’d love to be able to make myself vomit after eating to achieve a flat stomach, but i don’t, because i cant.

What i really want to know is, is this considered an eating disorder even though i don’t make myself vomit (only because i am unable to), and don’t think im crazy fat, but id love to be skinnier?

If you can't believe that, I understand. But if I've learned anything this year it's that, there will always be something beautiful enough to bring you to tears, there will always be a person out there in the world to find you.

Listen people it’s the end of the rope for me. I can’t stand living like this anymore. I think about it every single day. Everybody is so mean to me and I’m too suppressed to be myself. Every single day I dream about just breaking free. I’m chained I just want to live “my truth” Anyone else feel like this? Every single day I just bottle this stuff in.

I want to go into detail but there’s so much stuff I just gotta be vague here. But my life is driving me up the wall and I just want to break free from it every day. It’s not meant for me and I just wish I had someone to talk to or something I feel like I have nobody.",23Nov2019,1

12,"So....when I was with my ex I developed what I am calling ""monster anxiety"". What it is is this uncontrollable need to say what I'm feeling. I will text or talk until I feel like I've said everything I need to then cry for an hour. 

Apparently...this is a protective coping mechanism due to the extreme abuse I've suffered throughout my entire life including: abandonment, rape, verbal financial and physical abuse...during my relationship with my ex I couldn't ever get away and was controlled to the point I lost my sanity....

Now I'm trying to renew my sense of self and overcome my monster anxiety.

13,"Today I went to therapy and I was going on about how I'm very unhappy with the way my life has turned out, Quite the usual for me. However this time she said something that shocked me to the core. We've established pretty much that I don't have a close relationship with my family. And stemming from this I mentioned that my family would only grow to see my pain if I disappeared. She told me they wouldn't care at all if I wasn't around. From what she's gathered if my relationship isn't great with me being there, Why would I think they would miss me if I was gone? I never really considered this as a possibility honestly. If anything it makes me feel worse becsuse not only do I feel completely alone in this world, but knowing that no one would miss me is quite upsetting. I know it's probably a huge reach to assume such a thing but maybe she is right. I can only hope someday I can be strong enough to make it on my own and finally be happy.",23Nov2019,1
14,"I'm drowning and choking in tears right now. It's almost 4am and I haven't been able to fall asleep because my thoughts are keeping me up. I just wanna sob loudly but I can't because I'll wake up everyone. My brother has been suicidal for years and lately it's been getting worse. He's practically on the verge of suicide and at this point I'm just waiting for the day when it happens for real. I've prepared myself mentally. My dad is constantly complaining about his heart and is on the verge of getting a heart attack. My parents have divorced this year, so I see my mother about two times a week now. I miss having her by my side every day. She's not taking her anemia supplements and her iron is almost 0. She's overworking herself and drowning in debt, barely sleeping, constantly wanting to faint etc. I started isolating myself and I feel like I'm slowly losing even my friends. I simply don't have energy anymore with all this shit happening. My humor is disappearing and people at school are noticing something's off. I'm constantly on the verge of tears in public and everytime I come home, I cry. I'm afraid of everyone in my family dying. My brother has been hospitalized 3 times for suicide attempts this year. Last weekend, he stood in front of my father with a hammer in his hand and almost hit himself in the head. About two months ago, he slit his hands and overdosed on his medication and alcohol, and I had to clean his bloody wounds. On top of all that, I'm keeping straight A's in school because I wanna move away from this country when I grow up, but everything is draining. I just wanna eat, cry and  sleep. But if I did that, I would only feel worse about myself. I'm trying to keep things in my control as much as I can but it's slowly starting to become harder. If my brother succeeds in killing himself, I'm afraid that it will trigger my parents and...god, I'm ranting. I don't even wanna think about that. But I AM thinking. I'm 15 and even though I try to stay strong, there's a limit for everything.

You see, i’ve come to the realization that I have some pretty deep trauma that I have not allowed myself to even admit to myself yet. If you combine that with an endless list of fears about the future then you get me. 
I’m a person who feels trapped between his past and his future. Quite literally mired between a past he had no control of and a future which he has no control over. 
That’s how i’d describe myself at this point in my life. 
I am emotionally handicapped by an uncontrollable past and scared shitless to move toward the uncontrollable future. 

I am a forty year old man who spends 80 percent of his day, every day, sitting in his small Hollywood apartment creating these abso-fucking-lutely stylish and genre-making Scripts and screenplays(because there is a fucking difference dammit.) Scripts that are actual social inquiries into what it means to be alive in this time, in this era, in this country. All  written by me, a highly analytical savant who also happens to be a large, poor, gay, black man from the center of most-confederate of all the Confederate States, South Carolina. 

I  am creating these ‘manga opera’ because I am compelled to do it. It’s as if these worlds I am building/crafting aren’t coming from me but are rather coming through me. 
But no one wants to see them. 
Isn’t that insane? Here I am, this Intellect and Artist who is writing to do two things and two things ONLY! One, i’m writing to change my life. And two, i’m writing to change the world! 

Remember when words were THE most important thing?!

I’m not bitter. I’m not. 
I just wish that hollywood and publishing the literati were receptive to screenplays or scripts(because there is a fucking difference!) written by a large, gay, savant, black man from the center of the most-confederate of all confederate states; South Carolina.


Most film and tv today follow this industry standard structure. A structure that is forced and doesn’t fit all the stories that need to be told. 
It just doesn’t. 
Also, most film and tv default to this notion that the audience should walk away feeling some manner of warm-n-fuzzy. A warm and fuzzy that reassures the audience that ‘we are ok.” 

Well, we are not ok. 
That’s the truth of it. 

We are not fucking ok!

I know it. 
Deep down, all of us know it. 


Because we, each of us individually has spent years lying to ourselves. Lying to yourself by pretending that you were ok when you really weren’t ok. But you had to. You had to lie to yourself because that’s the only way you could keep going. 
But you aren’t ok. You never were. 
But deep down,  you desperately want and need to BE ok. And so you try. You try hard. You go digging through your own emotional muck and your backlog of trauma in order to lighten that depression that’s weighing you down. Because you can see the happy and content version of yourself just up ahead, barely out of reach. 
And you want to get there. You want to get to that happy and content version of yourself that’s just up ahead. 
But something’s holding you back. 
Depression. 
Like weight around your ankles and wrists and on your back, making even the simplest movements so much more difficult. 
But you are actively, purposefully and intentionally using your art, your medium- WRITING as a tool to work through all this shit. 
And your work is raw, honest, rational and logical and dumbfoundingly good. 

I’ve been here in Hollywood for ten years trying to find space for my perspective in this brutal, punishing and unfairly stacked industry. 
It’s hard. It really is. Once upon a time I would never have spoken that out loud. But it is soo fucking hard! 
It can be madness making sometimes.
But all i want to do is tell stories. 
All i want to do is tell the kind of stories that that little traumatized, fractured, overweight, gay, black boy from middle of nowhere South Carolina I was needed to see. 

Maybe someone reading this will know or even someone who is a champion of outsider voices. Maybe.

I was given faulty tools in my life but it doesn’t make me any less worthy a craftsman.

20,"Social media has always heavily affected my mood and too long ago before I finally decided to delete Facebook, I realized it was the most toxic social media site of them all. Instagram is the only social media site I have besides Reddit and I know Instagram has its negatives too but I find I can handle it better than Facebook. The content is a little more controlled and it just feels good to not have to “need” it like I thought I did every time I pussied out on deleting it before. Also, I had way too many friends on there, like 800+ and I know I don’t know that many people. It wasn’t worth my time to weed through them all and with a daughter now I don’t want that many people knowing about my personal life.

25,"I’m at an academic conference. The most important one in my field. I’m meeting scholarly idols, mentors, future employees. In between elevator pitches, bites of cheese, washed down with gulps of wine, I run to the bathroom, the hotel staircase, the outside to cry my eyes out. I pretend I’m sick. I’m not sick.

Everyone is so impressed with me. My academic work. How much I publish. The way I think. I’m so ashamed of my successes, of anything I do. To other people it’s a job. Their real life is their family. I have nothing else. My work is my everything. That’s why I do so well. The only reason I do so well. And being good at it, and being recognized for it, just reminds me of how much I have failed.

Three months ago, the person I loved most in the world took me out like trash. She didn’t want to be with a woman. She didn’t want to be with me. She was ashamed of me. She wouldn’t even acknowledge me or my pain once she was done with me. She called it incompatibility. She wasn’t even able to acknowledge her own internalized homophobia. I start every day trying to fight her hurtful words: I am ashamed of you. I tell myself she’s wrong. But before 9am I cry into my coffee, yelling at myself that I am the one who’s wrong.

Today I looked down the hotel staircase on the 14th floor. I wouldn’t be able to jump. But I no longer don’t want to jump. I want things to end. I don’t want to punish her. I do want her to know what she did to me. I do want people to finally know I’m not okay.

I moved to Europe since the breakup. Started dating. Took up new hobbies. In theory I have a therapist. But things are just getting worse. Every day is worse.

I am worthless. The fact that I know she doesn’t get to determine my worth, that I determine it and that I determine it to be zero, just makes me feel worse. I am worthless and it’s not because she said so, but because I said so. Because I firmly believe it. And because I can’t change my own mind. I put up with her abuse, knowing it was abuse, knowing she didn’t have the capacity to change. I am worthless.

She wouldn’t face her demons for me. She chose not to grow emotionally for me. Her love came at the cost of  disdain—because I did the unspeakable and made her love a woman. I did the unspeakable and ruined her beautiful heterosexual fantasy. She had to punish me to make it not true. And so her great shame became my shame. 

I’ve cried so much in the last days, I look scary. I scare myself. I can’t sleep because my eyes hurt from crying. I can’t get a grip, because my brain won’t get to rest.

I’m constantly processing the breakup, reaching ever new heights of insight. Replaying her most hurtful words in front of my inner ear. Realizing what I put up with. Acknowledging that I brought this on myself. That she took a good look at me and found me worthless and let me know she found me worthless. And that I just nodded and smiled.

I still miss and love her so much, my heart becomes heavier every day. I still want her to be my wife and the mother of my children. I am not delusional. I know she is ten years behind emotionally from where I need her to be. I hate myself for wanting the impossible, the harmful.

This isn’t just a break-up. This is what homophobia feels like. I wish someone had punched me in the face and called me a fagot. It would be easier to be angry at them, not me.

Everyone who ever loved me couldn’t help but be ashamed of me. My parents. Her. There is no love without shame for me. What does that tell me? I am shameful. “You make it impossible to love you” is a line from a movie I liked when I was so small, thinking I had finally found myself in the character that like was addressed to.

I was good enough to fuck her, be there for her. I wasn’t good enough for her to try harder. Try at all. She told me all the ways in which she wouldn’t, couldn’t be there for me. And I just accepted it, and scolded myself for being so needy. How needy to want to share my heart with her. Better keep it locked away.

She makes herself sleep with men, even though she feels no attraction to them. She wouldn’t do a single thing to work on us, because it would have meant admitting that she took an active part in realizing her queer desire. She would do for a man, any man, what she wouldn’t do for me. I never doubted her love through all this. But I am worth less than the shit underneath her shoe.

There was nothing I could have done differently. It’s not what I did, it’s who I am. I am shameful.

These professors look at me like I’m the next big thing. Like the world is mine for the taking. When I open my mouth and talk about my research, people listen. Old white men listen to what this gay, foreign girl has to say. People compliment me. I am in hell.

My voice is raspy not from the cold I feign but from the hours I spend in agony. Brisk walks through this city at night and in the morning and during break, to keep the tears at bay. The tears that always come. 

The more they respect me, the more I hate myself.

All I wanted was her. To be seen and heard and loved. Putting her shame and her hatred on me was the only emotional act she was capable of. And I accepted it gratefully.

Receiving someone’s shame and hatred is all I’ve known for the last year and a half. It’s all I’ve known all my life. Everything feels dark. I have to cry quietly so people won’t notice me. I can’t breathe.",23Nov2019,1

It felt like everything was fine for those couple seconds. When I pulled away I didn’t want it to end kind of thing. From that moment on I felt a nervous/somewhat good feeling everytime I think of her. And ever since that moment I really just wanna make out with her. I know it sounds weird but it’s how I feel.

29,"I don't believe that I am a person of high value. 
A  of people really like me for some reason and get attached to me really fast. They think I'm funny, cool, and kind. I just see myself as awkward. I have dark thoughts in my head all the time. I just try my best to connect with people in as intimate ways as possible. For example, there's a deaf worker at my school. I learned some things in sign language to talk to her. There was a girl in my school who didn't know English well, so I helped her learn it better. 
Everyone says that I'm of high value, that I deserve to be with someone that's good enough for me. I've even had an ex that said he wasn't good enough for me and that I deserved better. But I don't believe people can have higher value than other people or be better than them. That same ex that said I was too good for him, threw me away like I was nothing. Another guy I was talking to just ghosted me like I was nothing. So how do I have high value? People always say that they love me and miss me. I don't know what makes me a desirable person to be around. I don't know what I'm good at. I'm smart, but what good are smarts? A lot of people are smarter than me. I'm okay looking: short(5'0), African American female,104Ibs. I looked like I'm 16 bit I'm 20. But what does that matter. I feel like I'm swimming in a sea of just no importance. What does it mean when people say you are of high value?",23Nov2019,1

Everything just melted away when I felt her lips on mine. It felt like all my problems melted away while we were kissing. It felt like everything was fine for those couple seconds. When I pulled away I didn’t want it to end kind of thing. From that moment on I felt a nervous/somewhat good feeling everytime I think of her.

37,"This is a series of dreams over multiple months, I don't remember them all but I can remember clearly the first few dreams as well as the final of these dreams.

The first dream I had started by me standing at the foot of my bed, staring at myself sleep but from a perspective taller than mine in a sort of black and white night vision, I tried to wake up my mom because I was scared but she couldn't hear me, I then went to the kitchen to find a snack because I started to get hungry but on my way I walked past a mirror to see no reflection of myself. I then decided my best course of action was to wake myself up in my dream, but as soon as I touched my sleeping body I jolted awake and I was so hungry I had a sharp pain in my stomach.

The following night I fell asleep and the dream started the same, standing over myself in a taller body, but this time I realized it was a dream and decided to explore, as I was walking the streets a large lanky dark figure in the distance called out to me, as soon as I looked towards it it had teleported infront of me. It was a tall creature with long slim legs and a short body with a round blank face, all of it completely black (it actually was a weird mix between an enderman from Minecraft and slenderman), he exclaimed ""another one! Finally!"" And I responded with confusion (I couldn't talk but physically showed confusion) ""oh so you're new, do you know what is happening?"" And I shook my head no. ""Well! Did you eat last time you were here?"" No I responded ""well let me teach you! Follow me"" I followed him to one of my neighbors houses and into their sons room (mind you, I have never been in this future friends room but when I finally did go a year or so later it looked eerily similar) he then proceeded to ""sucked"" the soul out of my young neighbor and then told me that this is how I must eat and if I don't I will suffer from extreme hunger until I feast again, so I went to his sister's room and sucked her soul and immediately woke up, no stomach pains

A week later I had the dream again, but my new friend in my room with me already ""ah you're back! Gotta eat once a week or else you will hurt when you wake"" i then started to go to my same neighbors house and my friends stopped me ""no! You cannot feast on the same soul ever again! That will kill their soul and body!"" I then went to a different neighbors house and woke up after eating

These dreams happened weekly, I would suck the soul of a kid and immediately wake up, unable to suck the soul of the same child twice.
But everytime I was unable to eat before the beginning of sunrise I would jolt awake with a sharp pain and extreme hunger, and then have the dream again the next night rather than a week later. Being so young and being into the supernatural I quickly believed these dreams to be true and a sort of portal to another dimension/my transformation into a demon.

My last dream happened near the end of summer, just before I turned 12, I had a girl my age living two doors away from me that had cancer, I refused to ever go to her house as she is suffering enough, but that night my friend told me that I have to go to her tonight, as he had feasted on her already that night and I must now kill her because it was her time. Being that I knew her well and believed this all to be true I refused to do it, and after arguing with my friend for a bit I finally ran up to my room and began to suck the soul of myself, and I watched a smaller translucent version of my friend rise out of me and pop like a bubble just before I woke up, hungry again.

But the next night I didn't have the dream, and same with the night after, and I have never had a dream similar since. 

And what truly solidified my belief that my dreams were a reality, exactly a week after my last dream the news spread around the neighborhood that the girl with cancer was deemed cancer free!

40,"I think I’m supposed to apologize for being on mobile 
 I’m also a little drunk so sorry for that too
I think I’m starting to self harm. Like I feel like I’m developing that impulse whenever life gets uncomfortable. I’ve been going through a lot the past year and I have a lot of anger built up.

The first time I did it, it wasn’t really anything. I just took the battery cover off of my remote and pressed it into my arm and dragged it up. It only left a scratch for a week or so. I did it after I had an argument with my boyfriend. I know, pathetic right… 3/4 times have been after ive had problems with my bf
It isn’t bc of him. I know doing this to my body is my decision and I would never blame him.  It mostly happens when I feel like it’s my fault that we’ve argued in the first place.  
The second time I was frustrated bc something I was really looking forward to got canceled. I punched myself a few times. I just felt so angry. I just want to fight everyone but I can’t. I can’t only fight myself. 
The third time, after another bf problem, I took my belt and tightened it around my neck a couple times. It was only for a few seconds. Then I bent it and slapped my thighs a few more times. After this time I told my bf bc I started to get more worried about the level of anger I had. I only told him about the second time. He encouraged me to tell my therapist but I haven’t yet. 
This last time just happened a few hours ago. Bf issue again. I planned it this time. I thought about what I wanted to do.  And I waited for everyone else to go to bed. All I knew is I wanted to burn myself. I got the lighter and I looked in our junk drawer for something metal. I found pliers and a coin and decided that was good enough. When I went to burn myself the first time it was too hot. I pulled away.  It barely even touched me. I didn’t get what I wanted. Although honestly I don’t know what I want. It just feels like I have to do it. It’s like an itch and I have to scratch it. It left a small mark but it’ll probably b gone tomorrow. I did it again like a minute or so later it only burned a little so I just dug it into my skin. 

I don’t really know what the point of this is I think it just feels better to tell someone and no one at the same time. 
The reason I’m hesitant about telling my therapist is bc I don’t want her to think I’m a danger to myself. I don’t want to be sent somewhere. I don’t have insurance right now and I don’t want to worry my family. I’m also not sure if it would actually help. I’ve heard people say it doesn’t help at all and in some cases made it worse. 
I don’t really know how to end this so...bye",23Nov2019,1
41,"Ever since I was a child, I was particularly obsessed with the idea of aliens. My room was decorated with silly little figurines and posters of aliens from my favorite shows and movies. You could only imagine my excitement when the government announced an open program to find extraterrestrial life. Anyone could join, just pass a test, pack up, and spend the rest of your life with a bunch of strangers looking for life on other planets. The government would give the crew almost full control of the operations of the ship, so they could come back at any time. 

I studied and trained for years just so that I could have a shot at living among the stars. 

That was about 20 years ago.

And we're still looking. Sure, we found some bacteria and fungi and even basic flora on other planets. The flora, especially, was amazing to see. It was a perfect balance of strange and familiar. It was beautiful. Beautiful, but it didn't feel satisfying. We wanted ""real"" aliens. The kind they make the movies about, the kind that abducts livestock in their UFO's. 

And now, we found them. We double-checked, triple-checked, and yeah, aliens. ""Real"" aliens. I was tempted to land their planet, get out, and make First Contact. The crew agreed, but they decided to wait first. To wait and watch and learn, before we said anything to them. It took months, but we learned their language, their basic cultures, customs, rituals, et cetera.

We felt like children on Christmas morning again. Like we were folding a corner of a paper wrapping to get the slightest peek at what the present was, careful to not tear or crease the wrapper, careful to not make a single sound. 

What we saw was... horrible. We expected to see a beautiful utopia full of whimsical technology. We expected flying cars, teleporters, robots, and the like. Instead, we saw savages. They were born from war and murder. They had terrible weapons built to kill as easily and as horrifically as possible. 

They had no fangs or claws, but they were still terrifying. They were smaller than us, physically, but it was like they were... denser. They had more extreme emotions, they were proportionally stronger, more dangerous, and they were unstoppable. They weren't immortal, but they might as well be. 

They're called ""humans"".

 It was either curiosity or insanity that made us choose to meet one, and to study it. We were to ask it some questions, record some data, perform some tests, and relay that information back to the government. We didn't know what we were going to do with the human after, we just wanted to complete the research.

An AI system was to choose the First Contact human. It chose someone who had few connections to other humans and had few responsibilities. 

It chose Liam. He was 19 years old, had an average height and build for a human, and he would have a perfectly symmetrical face if it weren't for a scar cutting vertically through his right eyebrow. 

He lived alone a few miles away from any other humans, which was perfect, we didn't want anyone else seeing us. 

We landed in front of his house. The planet's gravity was a little stronger than normal, so the landing was a little rough, but no damage was caused to the ship. Or his house. A lottery system was drawn to choose who spoke directly to Liam. My name was drawn. 

I spoke a small amount of his language, but we decided to play it safe and rely on a translator instead. The AI that chose Liam helped build the translator's vocabulary and grammar by picking out real human conversations and learning what the words meant and how they were used. 

A small button was next to the front door. I've seen this before when we were watching the humans, it alerted anyone inside that someone wished to come in. I pushed it, and it made a small noise that startled me a little bit. A voice came from the inside. 

""Who is it?"" 

My translator chirped, and activated

""Uh, Liam, right? We wanted to-""

""Listen, if you're trying to sell me something, I'm not interested. What do you need?""

""We just wanted to ask a few questions.""

A short silence came from the both of us.

""Fine, I have nothing better to do,"" Liam said, opening the door from the inside, ""so what do yo-OH WHAT THE [no translation]?!""

""Hi.""

""WHAT THE [no translation] ARE YOU?!""

""To you, Liam, I'm what you would call an 'alien'.""

Another silence. I was the next to speak.

""Yeah, it's my first time meeting an alien, too. Would you please answer some questions for us?""

""Uh, okay, but, h-how do you know my name?""

""We've been... closely observing the human race. But, just observing isn't enough. Please come with us.""

""Where?""

""To our ship. There, we will ask those questions we have for you and we will run some tests. After about a week you will be returned to your home, if you're worried about that.""

""What kind of tests?""

""Mostly intelligence and physical fitness tests. You said you had nothing better to do, right?""

""Fine.""

The results were interesting. We've only been observing humanity for a few months, so some information was still unknown. We knew they were the apex predators of their planet, but we didn't know how. 

They had no claws to kill prey, no sharp fangs to tear flesh, and they couldn't pounce like the other predators on their planet. They can't outrun half their prey. So how could they be effective hunters? 

They're ""persistence hunters"". This form of hunting was new to us, and we were reminded of how terrifying humans can be. They don't sneak up on their prey, like a normal predator would. They let their prey see them, and they let it run. Then, the human would simply follow the prey. Not nearly at the same speed as said prey, humans are much slower. 

Humans will simply walk towards prey until it collapses from exhaustion. Then, the human will take a sharp rock or something and kill it. Humans walk on two legs, whereas most of their prey walks on four. This is more efficient for conserving energy. They leak water from their skin to cool down their bodies, much like fancy computers. They are simply unstoppable once they get their eyes on a target.

Naturally, Liam showed this ability in the tests we gave him. I won't bother with details or scores, but his physical endurance and his focus were especially astonishing. 

The day came when Liam was to return home to his own planet. All questions were answered, and the data from the tests were recorded. We didn't know what to do next, honestly. History's greatest question was answered, but it made a few more questions. Should we go back home? Should we find another human and get more information? Should we keep looking for more aliens?

I found Liam in his ""room"", as he called it. We noticed each other at the same time, but I was the first to speak.

""Well, Liam. Firstly, I want to thank you for complying with us so easily. Secondly, I am here to inform you that we are ready to return you back to your home planet.""

Liam looked up from whatever he was doing, and thought to himself for a moment. He took a small breath before saying something quietly that I couldn't quite make out. 

""What was that, Liam?""

""No. I said no.""

His answer shocked me. 

""What do you mean, 'no'?""

""I don't want to go back to Earth. It's... boring. I have nothing to do there, and trust me, I've tried doing everything.""

""Won't you miss it? Won't anyone miss you?""

""No, I don't think so. If anyone would happen to miss me, I don't think I'd care. Either way I wouldn't...""

Liam trailed off and his face went blank. He interrupted himself with nothing. He bit his lower lip, a sign of human nervousness. 

He continued. 

""I want to join you guys. I want to explore space. I never felt... content on Earth. It's cheesy, but on these few days, with you guys, I felt like I belonged somewhere, like I was doing something."" 

""Liam, are you absolutely sure about all that?""

""Hell no. So what are you going to do next?""

""I don't know, actually. I think we're going to report back out information to our homeplanet, and return there. Would you like to come?""

Liam answered my question with another question.

""What's it like there?""

""I think you’d like it. It’s a lot like your Earth, only less extreme in climate, and it’s much... quieter. We have mountains, beaches, and forests, but we have two moons and an asteroid belt that are all very beautiful at dusk.""

""That sounds nice.”",23Nov2019,1
42,"I had the most amazing time with him in my dream last night and I woke up and felt it all fade away. I ended up feeling extremely empty and uncomfortable. I legitimately wondered if I traveled to some alternate reality where things turned out alright. 

I am ok with the nightmares. Bad dreams are better for me because at least my reality is better and I can soothe myself with that fact. It’s the dreams where I feel safe and comfortable and close to him that fuck me up. 

I am so tired and unable to sleep because of it. All day I felt like it was back to square one of moving on. Even while trying to distract myself and not think about it, i felt awful. Unfortunately it’s impossible to forget him entirely because I’m pregnant with his child but I was doing so well. Now I’m a quivering, weeping mess as if I am some child myself.

45,"Early today I got accepted into a job that I've worked really hard to get, and that is a perfect fit for me, and that I already practice as a hobby, so I was feeling damn high. Real good about myself and my future. 


I come from a very poor background of manual labourers, I've experienced homelessness as a child and economic strain my entire life. 2008 nearly killed my family. I wouldn't wish poverty on anyone and so it feels real good to be hopeful about life for once. For most of the day my ego was unusually boosted and I was confident as hell. My normally paralyzing social anxiety and low self-esteem completely vanished. I figured I'd go balls to the wall mad lad and get a job and a date in one day. That'd be a change of pace for me. So I asked my crush out and she said yes!


I was basically on hype overdrive at this point. Probably too much hype actually, not safe for the health. Then she texted me a few hours later and explained she's in a relationship, she didn't realize I meant it as a *date*. I did word the offer poorly, she misunderstood and thought I meant it in like a platonic way. My field is IT so I'm pretty acquainted with rejection but this one stung a bit worse just because there was a few hours of glee. It's an awkward situation, but I think I'm good at facing rejection with dignity and she seems like a chill person so we'll still chit-chat casually.


Despite the initial sting I have now achieved a state of what feels like perfect mental neutrality. I feel simultaneously both hope and heartbreak and they kinda just cancel each-other out. Whenever I feel a bit sad the hope kicks in. Whenever I feel a bit too happy the heartbreak kicks in. I feel like an idiot but I also feel smart, making me feel kinda average. I didn't know emotions worked like this.

47,"If it was just me I had to take care of, I wouldn’t be scared. I don’t care for myself enough to worry if I’ll be homeless in the next year. But I have animals that I love and I made a promise to, I can’t abandon them, they are all that’s kept me going, and they need a warm place to live and lots of food to eat. My animals aren’t extremely expensive to keep, but I’m essentially mentally disabled and I don’t know how stable my life will be.

My family is abusive, and I need to leave as soon as I can. I can’t take it anymore. I just need to leave. I’ve lived in a rich, conservative home all my life, my parents believe no one can fail because “trumps making he economy better than ever”. When in reality it’s our rich asses getting the bonus check.

I have been abused to the point where I have become unable to function normally in society. I wasn’t always like this. I’ve always had issues, but this didn’t just come about on its own.

I’m scared to make that step to leave because I’ll be leaving with probably 0 support and nothing to my name. They will probably drain my bank accounts if I do manage to save up anything to leave and I don’t have my own car. They want me to stay to be some kinda of slave to “take care” of them for the rest of my life. My mom said se will fight to get legal guardianship of me, and that I will “repay” them for all they’ve done for me.

I think my grandma would let me live with her, but my family will probably follow me. My boyfriend’s family has offered me to live with them, but I just can’t do that unless I have stable income to repay them.

Ideally I want to have one job and rent an animal friendly apartment with a private washer and dryer (I have to wash blankets and towels that have been peed on as I have guinea pigs and I don’t think I’d be allowed to wash them anywhere else). But I know that with my medications, health problems, mental problems, and just how America is now in general, that sounds impossible. I’ve tried my hardest to calculate the minimum income I need, and looking for jobs in the field of work I want to go into, it seems impossible to achieve.

I feel hopeless, because I have no experience on how to make sure I can afford living since I’ve just never been taught anything. I know how to manage money, I wouldn’t be spending money on things I don’t need, but I feel like finding an apartment that would fit me and my animal’s needs is going to be hard. Guinea pigs are just are a lot of work and take up a lot of space as-well as eat a lot which in turn means poop a lot too. I don’t need to spend money on bedding because I use fleece and towels but I need an outdoor space to shake out said blankets and also a wash and dryer to wash them. I don’t know if landlords typically are ok with that stuff, I don’t know if I’ll have to pay extra for having my pigs (I have three).

I’m just scared, because I want to leave but I worry my mom is right and I’m never going to get anywhere in life. I just want to be on my own and be in control of my life. I want to be able to make myself a new life and new family and forget about everything here.

I worry that because I’ve in an upper class home that I underestimate the reality of living independently. I’ve seen how hard it is and seen people in situations like mine end up on the streets because there’s nothing they can do to make a living wage when you have severe anxiety like mine.

I know that at this point I’m past “doing what I want” for work and that I will probably have to choose something I quite dislike. But at this point I feel like I don’t care, as long as I can get myself and my animals into somewhere that works for them then that’s all I want.

I'm going to turn 22 in December and all I am is a big loser. I've not done anything interesting till now and I fucking hate myself for it. I'm pretty lonely and I think people can see thru my pathetic veil that I put on for the world. I keep telling people I'm happy with my work, I love living a new place and I am happy in general. I keep repeating this so that I sound convincing but everyone knows what kind of a loser I am. 

I graduated college in May and all I did for the last four years is drink so that I could forget how much  I hate myself. I got a job that pays really well right after I graduated and I think I'm not doing enough to show why I was worth it. I work 50+ hours a week and I think that's still not enough to carry my dead weight and prove to my manager why I'm worth it. I can't work more than what I am at right now and I fucking hate it. I wish there were more hours in a day so that I could work more and maybe block all the hate that I have for myself. 

Just the other day I was in the gym doing some reps after an intense cardio session and my muscles just gave away and I couldn't lift anymore. I looked in the mirror and told myself it's fine, you did your best. Then something snapped in me and I said that I'm fucking loser to say that and I'll never get anything done ever again. Ever since that day everytime I look in the mirror I see a fucking loser. I'm so tired and I don't think I can take anymore of this. 

I am a huge piece of shit. In 2018 my mother passed away and I wasn't even with my family. I was in school when I should have been with my family helping them. I should have done more but all I did was listen to their helpless voices describing my mother's deteriorating health. I hate myself for it. I hate that I couldn't be there for them. I hate that I couldn't be there for her. 

I don't think anyone will ever love me and I don't think I can too. I'm sorry if this annoying to read, I know that this is extremely easy to solve but I'm too fucking dense to do it.

Then my next question was has she ever given someone head and it took her about 20 seconds to repond to that she said ""what do you think"". i said ""yes?"". and she said ""i was in a abusive relationship and he was always pressuring me to do things"" my final question was when did she give head (i already knew off her past exs personality that it was him) and she said the first month they dated.

54,"If you knew how long you were going to live would you be more careful about the relationships you had in life? Whether that be friends, family, or romantic. I think a lot of us would. I’ve decided I’m going to be more careful about the relationships I have with others in my life. There’s only a finite amount of time we have on this earth, I’d rather use my time wisely and let someone who deserves it have it. I don’t want to waste it on people who don’t appreciate the valuable time I give them. Just a random thought",23Nov2019,1
55,"This is a message to you(yes you), Jacksepticeye, PewDiePie, MrBeast and even Chanté. I just want my story to be told. 

I came into this world as a reject. Born to a seemingly normal and loving family, pretty much had everything that I ever wanted, everything that I needed. My mom, well she's complicated. Looking back at my childhood, she only ever loved herself. Yes, she was affectionate towards me and my siblings, but only to feel good about herself, to make herself look better than she was, we were her trophies(not to brag, but I was her most prestigious trophy). Being the youngest of the three, with an age gap of a decade, I singlehandedly witnessed my parent's marriage fall apart. See, I used to suffer from night terrors, so I occasionally slept with my parents, this was more of a curse than a blessing, as the things I witnessed left me scarred. I remember my parents just screaming at eachother, mostly my mother. She would just get out of control and actually beat the crap out of my father in front of me, I was too young at the time to actually realise what was going on. I remember my mom trying to commit suicide in front of me multiple times. I remember trips to the hospital, neighbors rushing over to help and even the police being called from time to time. This was all before the age of 7. 

My childhood pretty much seemed normal to anyone that gave it a glance. My mother was incredibly beautiful, my dad rather quiet and an entrepreneur, so we had money and the big houses, but we were far from happy, far from normal indeed(as you probably have noted by what has already been said). In regards to family, yeah I got the jackpot, but that wasn't the only lottery that I won... 
Also at about age 7 I met another kid, Jack*. He was a few years older, and seemed rather cool at first. I don't remember much about all of this as I blocked most of it out. I do however remember begging my dad not to let Jack come over anymore, he simply shrugged it off and just said that I grew tired of him... I mean I was 7 years old amd here Jack was exposing me to all kinds of p*rn. Black mailing me to give him my PS and toys just in order to keep him quiet. I remember him occasionally breaking in through the windows when I refused to open the door. My parents, well they loved him, and they thought that the companionship would be a good thing. I really don't remember much, flashes here and there which I could only make sense of at a later stage. He always liked touching me, sleeping next to me, showering with me and stuff like that. Eventually we moved away after years of torment, mostly broken pieces of memories here and there. This was until I was about 12, I had gone back to my home town for a family visit/church retreat with my grandparents. They also liked Jack, so when he knocked on the front door after seeing me in the street they just let him in. Even invited him to stay the week. The few memories that I have of this week are rather graphic. At some stage I was at his house, I had no choice, no one wanted to believe me when I told them that Jack was evil. It again started with him showing me p*rn, he began touching me, being affectionate and stuff. Eventually he took out a pack of cigarettes and forced me to smoke just so that I can get into trouble. I however refused, he then threatened to burn me. He occasionally told me stories of what he used to do to me while I was sleeping, the pictures he took, the ways he touched me. He made my skin crawl, I was scared, I knew that I was still stuck with him for half of a week, the stuff he would do. The next day two days was torment, first I awoke with hickeys all over my body, this was humiliating as I had to go to church like this, even more humiliating thinking of what he'd done to me, I found him repulsive. All of the marks on my body only reminded me of him, I hated myself. After the festivities at church I came home to an empty house with Jack patiently awaiting my arrival. He then took me to the shed, locked the door and took off all my clothes. I still remember his breathing. I don't remember pain, just numbness, no emotion. This was what it's like to be dead I thought. After he was done he got dressed and left, leaving me in my brokenness. I just stayed there for at least an hour until the sound of my grandparents arriving started to stir something inside of me. I still see his mother occasionally when I visit my hometown. We haven't said a word since that day... 

Eventually my parents got a divorce. I was present for most of the fights. I remember the night that my mother had decided this. We had guests over, she had decided to tell my father that he had to sleep on the couch that night, humiliating him in front of his family. I slept next to my mother that night as the night terrors still hadn't stopped. I awoke the middle of the night, when my dad came bursting in through the door. He had decided that he'd rather sleep on the floor next to the bed than on the couch, this was to avoid further embarrassment from his family that decided to stay the night. This time my parents didn't scream at eachother. It was quiet, my father only spoke in hushed whispersas to not wake me or the guests. My mother, well she didn't care as much... At least she didn't scream. I remember my dad crying, he loved her, he just took all the years of abuse and still tried to save the marriage that was already doomed before either of us were born. They got a divorce not long after. I saw my parents marriage crumble in front of me... My mom still has a big influence in my dad and my life till this day. He still defends her to this day. 

After the divorce my mom got custody of me. The abuse slowly shifted from my father to me. It wasn't just physical, it became verbal and emotional even financial. I still remember countless suicide attempts and the involvement of neighbors/police. She had a high paying job and thus rewarded herself with new items of clothing/jewellery, she went out almost every single night and never fed me. At this stage I hadn't seen my father in years as my mother just bad mouthed him in front of me, she made me believe that everything was his fault, the debt that we later accumulated after he had lost his job, even the abuse and the fact that I almost never had food. My mother got me addicted to caffeine, she never fed me and only bought me Pepsi/Coke, this was litterally all that I consumed. About 2 litres a day. Till today I still drink a bottle a day, it's just a bad habit, and I feel absolutely horrible if I don't consume high caffeine content. I was roundabout 14 at this stage. My bones were protruding through the skin, you could see my ribcage and spine. I even remember my mom coming home one night with a bottle of Pepsi, touching me and telling me that I'm so nice and thin now(I used to be overweight as a kid). I still got pretty high marks in school, was a straight-A student, and we seemed pretty wealthy so no one ever suspected a thing. 

I eventually got into my first relationship. You know that saying that we inevitably end up dating our own parents. Yeah well, guess that's true. It actually seemed pretty good for the first view months, then the abuse started. This time however it was a triple whammy, physically, emotionally and sexually. She was actually a pretty nice girl, I think that we both were just in pretty rough places and things just happened, we just weren't compatible. I don't blame her. When my friends noticed all the bruises, cuts and holes in my arms, they pushed for us to break up. I had no self worth so I had never thought of even ending it, I just took it. Breaking up with her wasn't as easy as it sounded though. She refused. I would tell her that we were finished and she just promptly replied with a ""no we're not"". This happened at least once every two days. It seemed futile even trying to end it. Every once in a while it did seem successful, but then she would just come over to my house and force her way inside via my mother as they were friends. She would then just sit in my room and refuse to leave until I took her back. Afterwards we would make out and stuff. I then had a break for a view hours, maybe a day. After months of this happening continuously, a total of 11 months, my friends and I had finally succeeded. It took a lot. I was less than human, less than nothing. No self worth. 

Eventually came the self mutilation. It became quite serious rather quickly. And my father had finally succeeded in getting back into my life. We weren't as close then and had to rebuild our relationship from scratch. He had found out about the self mutilation and tried to get me help. It was just a therapist at first, but he quickly had to refer me to a psychiatrist as I was far to serious of a case. I was quickly diagnosed with major depression and anxiety, this later became Bipolar type 2 with episodes of psychosis. I would've gotten proper treatment had my mother not intervened, she stopped the weekly sessions with the therapist and also had an influence over my medication. I gained about 40-50 kg just because of my medication, my mother had also started feeding me more frequently and as I now had contact with my father I also started going over for the weekends. God I loved the braaing(it's like a bbq but just way more fun and truly South African, it's the Afrikaans'(my race) pride.

This is where Chanté came in, and no, that's her real name. She deserves recognition for what she did. I used to be nothing. Used and abused by every person that had ever come into my life. She was the first person to ever show me what I was worth. She was the first person to ever love me for who I am. She showed me that maybe, just maybe life was worth it. I still hadn't recieved proper medication, but the truth is that she was all I ever needed. She made me who I am. I still lived with my mother but that soon changed, she eventually kicked me out after another year of abuse. This was right after my father's wedding, he married a wonderful woman. A woman that I am proud to call my mom. They have since then also won the custody battle, but we still rely on my mother as she is the only person with an actual job. My parents (dad and stepmom) are foster parents, yeah, I live in a foster home. The country basically pays like R1000 a month per child and this isn't even close to covering their basic needs for a week. I see all of my foster brothers and sisters as my actual family. I am proud to say that I am one of 13 children. 

Things were slowly starting to look better. Chanté supported me in every way that she possibly could. My parents got me the help I needed, I got diagnosed with even more disorders this time around. Bipolar type 2, severe social anxiety disorder, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and still episodes of psychosis. It has now been a year since then and it is speculated that I might have a psychotic and personality disorder as well. I am pretty normal though despite all the medication that I have to consume on a daily basis. Eventually after switching schools(even languages) I finally got my grades back up. With the help of Chanté, MrBeast, Jacksepticeye and our true king PewDiePie I finally found my true calling. Inevitably me and Chanté ended, I still hope that one day we might be able to become friends. We both just got hurt in the process. She still had a significant impact on my life and showed me that there's more to life. She gave me something that no one else ever could: purpose. We wanted to change the world, we were planning on doing it. And even now without her by my side, I'm still planning on changing the world, at least in honor of her. 

Remember all those Youtubers that I mentioned, yeah well they helped me through the toughest of times. They made me laugh when I felt the world was ending. And they also helped inspire me. Chanté helped me finally get a Playstation before me went our separate ways. This was only the first step towards changing the world. 
I was inspired document my life, the things I love, such as music, games and just life in general. I started to make videos about controversial topics, such as AIDS and the foster system. I was planning on becoming a beacon for mental health and proof that one day everything will be okay. I wanted to do what PewDiePie, Jacksepticeye, MrBeast and Chanté did for me. I wanted to change the world even if it was just for one other person. I wanted to be a beacon and share my journey. I wanted to be more than that piece of shit I once was. I wanted to be proud of who I am. Who they made me. 

Upon making my 5th video, I just hit a rough patch. I don't really remember much. I had my first proper suicide attempt and I still don't really remember why I got to that point. I spent a couple of days in hospital and that's when my entire past hit me like a truck. I was angry, furious. Mostly had everyone that used me. I finally came to the realisation that shit happens and that we should just make the most out of what we got. We should never stop dreaming and definitely never give up, especially on ourselves. 

Upon being discharged from hospital I had to sell my Playstation and camera. I have no way to edit nor record videos and no idea how I'm going to play games or anything. I just want to continue with my life and enjoy it... I still haven't made another video, I'm trying to get a camera and gaming pc, which is rather hard considering that my mother won't contribute and my parents are foster parents. I just want to change the world... And I'm going to... It's just a matter of time. 

I am currently asking millionaires and foundations for money. Yes, I am that delusional that I think that this will help me finally be able to make videos again. I'm sharing this here, not because I'm hoping that someone in the Reddit community might have a GPU, CPU or spare camera lying around. I'm not asking for money nor am I looking for sympathy. I'm sharing this here because I want this message to reach MrBeast. I want this message to reach Jacksepticeye. I want this message to reach PewDiePie. I want this message to reach Chanté. And lastly, I want this message to reach you. I want them all to know that they changed the world, however small that may seem, even if it were just for me. Even you. Yes you, you will change the world, you already have. I love you, all of you. Don't ever doubt yourself. Don't ever give up, whatever you're facing, you will overcome it. Don't give up, because I know I won't. The truth is yes, sometimes I do want to die. But not today. Today, I know that I'm going to change the world. I just need a little help as of now. The truth is that life is beautiful. And it works in the most mysterious of ways.

56,"So often are interns seen as below the employee line. They’re tasked with running stupid errands, working overtime on meaningless projects, and taking loads of unnecessary shifts.

I am currently an intern, so I may be biased, but interns should be given a detailed job description before they go to work. A full list of all duties, responsibilities, and expectations should be required. When I accepted my internship, my offer letter laid out basic tasks and such. The amount of Shit I have had to put up with over the past six months is exhausting. Countless overtime shifts, people not respecting you, working on the weekends, running meaningless errands that aren’t related to why you’re in the internship, and many many more.

For example. I had to wake up at 3:30AM EST to go in to help run a protocol I am working on. I do understand that this is a commercial product, but I should not be expected as an intern to give up my valuable sleep and off-time to run some stupid protocol that someone else could run. It’s currently 5:30AM and literally NOTHING has happened. I’ve literally just been on my phone waiting for them to start. And the worst thing is, I can’t do anything to make it run sooner.

I was never told I’d be working on the weekends, doing countless overtime shifts, fucking up my sleep schedule, picking up people’s laziness, etc. yet here I am. I’m starting to resent the industry I’m in which is concerning as it is a profitable, innovative, and important industry. I’m trying to hold on to the small amount of interest I have but I CAN NOT WAIT for my internship to be over.

Literally fuck this, I wanna go back to sleep.

Oh I forgot to mention, I’m on call ALL weekend for this stupid project. ALL OF MY FUCKING WEEKEND. I’m literally an intern bro. Why????

I also have made up my mind, I’m never working at a place that requires me to be on call during my “off-hours” unless I’m given at least three days notice. I didn’t know I’d have to stay on call 24/7 this entire weekend until Friday at 3pm, 1.5 hours before I got off.

So employers, please include a detailed job description of what interns are required so they don’t get grumpy when they can’t go hang with their friends/family because you schedule them to work overtime :)",23Nov2019,1

58,"I would like some opinions on two issues.

First, I'd be willing to admit I'm an odd duck, I'm a bit of a hermit. I've never been popular with girls, whatever it is they want, I have no idea. Maybe in my whole life I've been on maybe 5 second dates. I'm in my 40's, savings well on the way to retirement, house is paid for, own a good car. My mother lives with me.

Growing up I thought I was handsome, but in school I met plenty of girls who thought otherwise and were bold to tell me I was annoying, ugly, goofy, it goes on. My brother says my problem is I'm an A-hole, maybe he's right. Growing up, my best friend was one of the most popular guys in school and mostly when a girl would start to talk with me, it was usually to get to him. 

I've been physically fit, heck in high school I could bench press 315lbs. I'm older now, I could stand to lose 30lbs, but its obvious I'm muscled. I groom myself, I shower, I wear nice clothes, I have multiple college degrees, top of my major. I've been told how disconcerting how intelligent I am. My friends' wives have told me, on paper I'm a total catch. My best friend's mother tells me that I'm a very handsome man.

But when it comes to relationships, something always goes wrong. And quickly. For decades I've wondered what it is about me that when a girl sees me from a distance why does she get this look on her face like she smells feces. Recently I finally got a clue what's puzzled me all my life. I was catching up with a girl I knew from high school on Facebook, we did the normal chat, how did life turn out for you, kids? Divorced? I was honest, ""truthfully I've never been lucky when it comes to dating, I know I'm an odd duck, a bit of a hermit, but to be bold whatever it is girls want, I ain't got it. etc..."" She replied and it sorta clicked and finally shed some light.

She said, ""oh its probably because at first glance you look like you have down syndrome, but then we talk to you and realize you don't and its off putting. All the girls knew it.""

SON OF A BITCH. I thought of it, and she said its my cheeks they make me look like I have it. At first I was shocked, but the more I thought of it, the more it made sense, it answered a lot of why I always get dirty looks. The decades of pity faces. The years of wondering what did I do wrong just walking up to someone I was meeting and smiling happy to meet them.

But now I wonder, is this right? Am I making some sort of self deluded answer to my personal failures?

Then my life took a left turn a month ago. My mother has taken ill again. I've taken care of her through lots of surgeries, breast cancer, chemo, hospital stays, but this newest illness its something else. The surgeon used the words, ""ticking time bomb."" And ""borrowed time."" She has damage that is fatal, could take a week, month, year or ten years, they don't know. But for now she is recovering and takes up a lot of my life. I think I've come to accept I'm going to lose her. She's into her 80's, its only a matter of time.

Which makes me wonder. Should I seek counseling from a professional therapist? 

I'll admit the family saw one when dad died 25 years ago. Didn't really do much to help. Mostly it just made mom feel good she tried something. But now as I understand why girls think I'm so ugly, and the stress of taking care of mom and potentially losing her. Can a therapist be helpful?

I just don't see how? I think while I'm a bit bummed that I'm ugly, what is a therapist going to do, make me feel happy about being ugly? I've had over a decade to come to terms with losing my mother due to all the illnesses she's had. But could she benefit from it? Right now its out of the question, she's under quarantine, has no energy and has a hard time moving. But is there help when/if she recovers? 

I just fail to see what can be done, but I don't want to ignore the possibility of getting some help out of ignorance. Its just life and a crummy hand. 

Does anyone have any wise words of advice?

TL/DR should I see a therapist because I'm ugly and my mother is dying? I don't see the benefit since I'm sorta at peace with both.",23Nov2019,1

	\- being controlled by someone by force

	\- being told what to do just because someone wants to , without furthering talking and opening up an actual conversation

	\- being obliged to do something i don't want to

	\- being with people i don't want to be with, but being with them to not disappoint them

	\- being ignored

	\- being the center of attention

	\- conceited and arrogant, who think they're always right

	\- racism, homofobia, and every other ideology that limits a person's right to express themselves by who they actually are

	\- being obliged to do favors for someone i don't like because of fear of some consequences (like being fired)

	\- who thinks their job is an actual job  and every other job is not an actual job

	\- when i get attacked for what i believe, in any way, wether it's physical or emotional

	\- falsehood, boredom, and taking life too seriously

	\-  the superficiality of interpersonal relationships

	\- the fact that some times i'm not able to react because of a mix of emotions, like what i should do, what i should feel, how i should react ecc.

	\- the ""true"" doctrin, in which i mean when a society thinks their way of thinking is the only true way of expressing life and what someone should so with their life

	\- bullying and not understanding what someone is dealing with emotionally

	\- not being supported by someone i think loves me

	\- not living in an environment where i feel emotionally and physically relaxed

	\- feeling like a debtor to someone o don't really like, but having social pressure about that

	\- not being able to express my true feelings with someone

I have this very odd addiction of plucking. It's only my chin hair though that gives me satisfaction.  I lay on the couch and pluck it every night. When I first started noticing I had chin hair it was just 1 or 2 of them (im Italian and have PCOS) but I still pluck like I have a whole beard (99% of it is actually white/peach fuzz). The feeling of satisfaction of pulling a dark one from the root is indescribable. After I get one I could feel, I'll examine at it under my phones flashlight, which is also satisfying. I get excited to go on vacation so I'll have good ones to pluck when I get home. My chin is actually leathery feeling on the bottom because of it.",23Nov2019,1

if you are in the transadorable or transtimelines subreddits and also like to look at nude pictures in subreddits like chubby or transgonewild, then create another account just for transadorable or transtimelines. because some puritan nutjob might look at your history, and assume just because you think trans woman are sexy then you can only be sexualizing them. its insane.",23Nov2019,1
88,"So as this semester is nearing its end and Thanksgiving break approaches, I have been bombarded with assignments. I go to my job from 10pm to 4am and just have not been working on these as much as I would like to. I had a lot of free time these past few days but instead of working on school, or even cleaning my room or showering, I have been just kind of doing my own writing and a lot of introspective thinking and as I near graduation I just can't help but think whats the point. I had absolutely no interest or intention of completing the assignments I have, but I will, albeit not nearly to the level I expect from myself. I think I'm just going to be honest with my (honestly very cool) professors and hope that they will understand that this was not out of being a bad student or drinking a lot or anything of that nature, my mind was just completely wrapped up in other things that I believed to be more important. I don't really know how I expect anybody to respond to this but I guess I just wanted to organize my thoughts somewhere",23Nov2019,1

90,"I used to be very shy as a kid. I always had problems with girls. They always thought i was cute but when in open my mouth it usually goes downhill.
I admired the guys who had it naturally and always got lots of sex. Which in also want.

I worked on myself for so many years and so hard I eventually started to actually have some success. I would get a girl here and there. And i was very proud of myself.

Recently I had an interaction with a cute girl. I hit all the nails on then head. Confident and sexual all the way. She was loving me and we recently had sex for the first time. I could tell she was really into but I had been working like crazy and ended up performing poorly. She pulled away really hard after that. Even after tons of emotional investment.

It's okay. Even if she ends up cutting me off. I'll get over it. I'm hurt sure. But I will pull through.

No second chances... no working on it... nothing. Harsh and cold distance.

Always with the tests. Always with this game... twisting up my emotions. I watch older couples. People who have it worked out. I wish for it so much.

I just want a partner to feel comfortable with. Communicate. Attack life together. But I'm fighting for my life on so many fronts and girls is just another one of them and I'm so tired. I'm never giving up, but I just feel like there's no mercy in this life. I have to as a man struggle every day. And never show weakness.

Even this little anonymous moment of weakness and confessing I need a rest makes me feel ashamed. Like if women saw it they would be disgusted 

I'll die before I quit... on my goals...on my dreams on the idea of a partner I can rest with when I'm beaten and crushed by struggling.

But right now I'm tired ... And alone.",23Nov2019,1
91,"It finally happened today. After almost three months of being in a deeply depressive, self deprecating, and self pitying frame of mind I finally had a peek through the curtains to my normal mind frame. It’s little things like someone smiling at you and responding when you ask how they’re doing. It’s not feeling out of place when you’re walking around the grocery store, not imagining that everyone is judging you. It’s coming to terms with yourself and getting to know your mind better. I’m not sure how long this feeling will last, but I’m going to hold onto it for as long as I can. Much luck to anyone else struggling with self hatred.",23Nov2019,1
92,"I fought through depression a few years ago. I truly thought I got past it. But since living in my new place, the familiar waves of sadness are back again. And sadly, I’m struggling to shake it off.  I didn’t want to admit to myself that the depression has returned.  But considering how it’s a fight to keep my mood up, I am accepting I’m back in this grey place. My dishes are in a pile. So are my clothes. I feel like these simple chores are impossible to tackle. My job frustrates me but lately I’ve been edgy to the point of crying. I’m not ok.  I feel more lonely than ever in my new place. That has triggered memories from that dark place I was in before. This move was suppose to be a fresh start. It’s been negative since I’ve been here. Maybe the disappointment has kick started these dark feelings again...I just want this cloud over my head to go away. I actually love to smile. I love to laugh. I like to be around people.

93,"Through most of my 20s i was depressed and used videogames as a coping mechanism. Buying and playing games was a way for me to escape the crushing sadness and emptiness I felt, but at the same time it was also a way to avoid tackling the underlying issues.

I own more or less every major console from modern to retro and about 1000 physical games.

A few years of therapy and self growth later I’ve decided to sell all those games to someone who can make better use of them and use that money to travel abroad for a year.

But he had a big arrow pointing to his dong. He had a trident but it was three dicks. He was so lonely so he went to the fortune teller. She was real sad. She said, ""You'll meet your true love. Soon."" He met this girl. She had red hair and it just flapped. They were underwater and it just flapped around her face like a spiderweb. It didn't look very good. He said, ""Hey"" and she said, ""Hey, how are you."" ""I'm good. Do you want to hold hands?"" and she was like, ""Yeah."" So they held hands. He said, ""If this is love..."" and he leaned in real close. Their noses were touching, ""then I don't want it."" HEEEYAHHHH! And he spin kicked that bitch out of the ocean.

I am only 17, so money isn't a major worry for me, but I still want to spend responsibly. I know I will wear them regularly (as I only have 3 other pairs of shoes), and I could definitely afford them, but I still feel buyer's remorse.

109,"So this is something I have to admit to at least someone. Ever since I first watched porn, I developed a fantasy about women who were much older than me. Even as a teenager, I used to exclusively look for pictures of woman above 50. It started because I was curious about woman of that age doing porn. And now I only seem to be sexually attracted to woman in the age range of 50s and early 60s after many years.

There is just something about woman of that age that I find attractive. They have better figures and bigger boobs than woman my age. And there is just something about a mature, wrinkled face. Even when searching for porn, I make sure that the women not only are in their 50s/60s, but they also look that age. It often gets frustrating to look for porn of that sort since most of it is just incest roleplay, but it's only older women that I am truly attracted to.

For example, I watched Arrow and the woman I found to be the hottest was Moira Queen, who is played by Susanna Thompson. When I watched Man of Steel, I thought Diane Lane was hotter than Amy Adams. And it's true for most of the TV shows or movies.

And it's not just the celebs.I find average looking women in their 50s or early 60s very attractive, but I don't see the fuss about objectively good looking actresses in their 20s or 30s. Given a choice, I would prefer a regular 55 year old woman who's average looking to any famous celebrity who's the ""appropriate"" age for me lol.

Now it's gotten to the point where my ultimate sexual fantasy is to go abroad and hook up with any average looking woman of that age. I don't frankly have any interest in 50+ woman of my ethnicity to be very blunt (I am an Indian).",23Nov2019,1

112,"I’m not saying I’m not over her. I’m 27. I was over her not long after we broke up all that time ago. 

There was this one time Me and her got caught in the rain. When we got back to her house after walking her family wasn’t home, and the power was out. I felt it was kind of risky, but went with it anyway. Bear in mind we were not actually dating yet, but this would officially mark the start of our relationship. She lit some candles, got a towel for us to sit on the couch, and sat down beside me.  I think we sat there in an awkward silence for a good 10 minutes waiting for something to happen. It was almost like a movie, really. 

Eventually she asked me the weirdest question I had ever heard. “Can I listen to your heart?” I wasn’t sure how to respond. I knew she had an interest in nursing so maybe it had something to do with that? I nodded, not entirely sure what to expect. She curled up, wrapped her arms around my neck loosely, and put her ear to my chest. I of course put my arm around her, but she took hold of my hand and rose it up and places it on her cheek. I cupped it lightly and began stroking her cheek with my thumb. Not sure why, just thought she’d like it for some reason. I remember her smiling and saying “perfect”. 

We just sat there in the dark, listening  to the rain, and just happy to have each other so close. And I liked it so much because there was no “hey will you go out with me?” Or anything. We just knew what it was we were becoming and went with it. 

Of course things happened and we split after maybe a year. It took a huge toll on me emotionally at the time. We hung out some months later, and while there were positive vibes we never met up again. 

I haven’t had my co interest in dating since. But lately it’s been raining I’ve been thinking about how nice it would be to have someone nearby to watch it with me.",23Nov2019,1
113,Hi,23Nov2019,1
114,"Today I found out my mom is cheating on my dad. My mom and I have always had a very close relationship and we tell each other everything. I guess today she felt we were close enough to tell me that she's cheating on my dad. I've lived around my parents long enough to know that they aren't compatible. As a kid, I listened to them screaming at each other. I saw my dad storm out during arguments and not come back for hours later, return and drink himself away until he passes out on the couch. I saw my mom lock herself in her room and cry all night. And many times throughout my upbringing I've prayed to God that they would just get a divorce already. But now, knowing that my mom has cheated on my dad; I can't help but feel broken. I've always had trust issues and I've been iffy about love in general due to my parent's unstable relationship, but despite all of that, I still had a smidge of hope that love still exists. Now, I think that the smidge of hope I had is gone. Is getting in a relationship worth it when at the end of the day it almost always ends in pain and heartbreak? I watched the front my parents put on in public and I've had people tell me that my parents seem perfect for each other and I would says respond, ""I know"" knowing damn well they constantly fight and sleep in separate rooms.  I've also seen people in great relationships turn around and cheat on their significant just because they're bored. So many people are willing to throw away a good thing just for a quick spiel of something new. If it happens so often and so easily, who is to say it won't happen to you or me? I'm 18 and I've never been in a relationship before, and despite the fact that sometimes I yearn for intimacy, I can't bring my guard down enough because I fear that in the end, it's gonna be a repeat of my parent's relationship. Living together unhappily because no one has enough pride to admit that the love is gone. If that's the case, I'd rather be single forever.",23Nov2019,1

I didn't learn math properly when I had the chance in the past, so I'm doing it now. I start regretting that I didn't do it right back then, that things would be better now if I did. I know this is not good, what's done is done, I can't keep living in the past about the mistakes I made.

I'm always thinking about how the future will be better, about this imaginary idyllic future where I have everything I want and there are no problems. This is a goddamn lie and a facade. That's not how things work and it won't matter how much I do, if I live with this idea I will never have enough, how could I? That standard is unreasonable. I want to enjoy things for the sake of them being enjoyable, not because I'll get something or because I will be better off. 

I have a lot of opportunity, moreso than many others in the world. I don't want to keep living in the past or the future. I know that plans must be made for the future, but you can't live life worrying about that future being as perfect as you envision it.

118,"I’ve been talking to this girl over text/phone for about three weeks now.

We had phone sex two days ago and the day after she became cold as fuck. All good until now. Anyway we talk again and I called her two hours ago when I went to bed. We had phone sex again. I kept telling her during “do you want me to stop” and she says no go on. I ask her that because I knew as soon as she cums she will be a different person. And that’s exactly what happened.

After we finished she said she was gonna go wash up. When she came back she made the cheapest move I’ve ever seen in my life. I’m actually still shocked she even attempted to pull this off.

She intentionally called me by a different name and when I asked who that was she said it was her ex. Then she made a shitty excuse to hangup by saying my sister wants something from me. I told her ok but I felt something was off.

Then I found out she immediately blocked me from all social media lol. It was at that time I realized a dodged a real bullet. Her just attempting to call me by her ex’s name to make me mad  in itself is shameful and cringeworthy.

121,"Not really sure where to put this, so here it is. I feel it fits here.

For the TLDR version, basically it's been 10 years since I have been in a relationship and 5 years since I was in a FWB situation. Around me I have friends of mine and co-workers around my age either getting married or having kids, and it makes me feel miserable. Not that I'm jealous of them, (far from it) but I feel like it's not something I'm able to do or can't do. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy with life right now. I've got a good job/car/living situation and the sky's the limit. Just when it comes to a relationship, I'm not sure what I want.

Some background: Got together with my ex about the time I graduated high school. We were together for just over 2 years. We had just moved in together and that's when stuff started falling apart. Basically we bit off more than we could chew. Money wasn't great at the time and we both had a lot of growing up to do.

Five years later a co-worker came up to me and said she was interested in me. Being single for 5 years without any female contact I didn't turn her down. It lasted for a few weeks and it ended. She was married and she and her husband wanted to try an open relationship, and needless to say it didn't work out with them for that. This girl was odd in the fact she was actually interested in me. She wanted to be around me and was attracted to me. My ex was like that also, but this was different. It just felt really weird at first, having someone interested in knowing what I was interested in and just wanting to be near me, and if anything I miss that the most.

Five years later, here I sit doing laundry, wondering what to do. I'm not sure what I am capable to do, because it has been so long. I don't want a potential partner to think I'm weird or think there's something wrong with me. I don't even know where to begin. I've tried apps like tinder, but I either don't get matches or I get no response back. I don't consider myself an ugly person, but I'm not a model either.

Either way, thanks for reading this far. I've never talked to anybody about this in person and I'm not sure if I could. It feels good to get it out in some way or form.",23Nov2019,1
