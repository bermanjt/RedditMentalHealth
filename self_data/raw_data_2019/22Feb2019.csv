5,"I got an internship working on a T.V set as a production assistant. My dad used to work in production and knows the owner of the company from college. I understood that the days were long and I was going to be on my feet all day. I was prepared, eager , and understood that I would get a lot of stress.


On the first day they had one production assistant, not even my supervisor show me around and explain things for ten minutes. One of my supervisors Meg is a woman, as soon as she meets me she takes a condescending tone with me and replies to me with ‚Äúyeah girl‚Äù passive aggressively. She also implies that I‚Äôm useless a lot.


I try to always keep a positive attitude, don‚Äôt complain, am punctual,and try to be a team player. I respect my coworkers boundaries, I try to make conversation about where they‚Äôre from or where they went to school. I try ask if they need any help or what needs to be done during down time. I walk around set checking trash/areas during down time. I ask other departments if they need help sometimes. I feel like I‚Äôm doing the same amount of work as my coworkers, but my supervisor nitpicks me a lot.


On my third day in I had only done one run. Usually what they mean by ‚Äúruns‚Äù is going out to buy stuff needed on set or get coffee/lunch for the higher ups. When asked to get lunch by my other supervisor Matt Meg rolled her eyes and gave three names of other people she‚Äôd rather go on the run. Finally she lets me go but is passive aggressive. It takes 30 minutes to get to the restaurant as soon as I get there at 30 minutes she texts me asking if I have gotten the food. I say no she says hurry up.


I get the food, get back as fast as I can while she‚Äôs constantly calling and texting me checking where I am. When I get back she grabs the food quickly in a condescending tone says ‚Äúthanks girl‚Äù.she told me to ask questions, that they want me to learn. But whenever I ask questions I get a ‚Äújust figure it OUT‚Äù or her rolling her eyes at me, then explaining to me like I‚Äôm five. I ask for feedback from my other supervisors and coworkers, they say I‚Äôm doing a good job. I always take criticism seriously and want to do the best job. 


She constantly whispers about me to my supervisor Matt. Sometimes I get confused about names of places on set or where stuff is. If I don‚Äôt know where stuff is immediately she‚Äôll whisper to him ‚ÄúOH ‚ÄúMY GOD SHES SO SLOW SHE DOESNT KNOW WHERE STUFF IS‚Äù. I‚Äôve never worked on a set before and I explained this to them. My supervisor Matt has a dog in the office that I have to walk sometimes. The dog is huge,it yanked me forward, and I got scraped up bad.


When Meg saw she was annoyed and told me to go to the medic then get back to work. Every time I enter a room I feel like Matt and Meg give me dirty looks and ignore me. I‚Äôm a reserved person, I like to keep to myself. I do try to take interest in my coworkers and learn a little bit about them but I feel guarded. On my last day of shooting I felt so uncomfortable. They said bye and thank you to me in a condescending tone.


I sent an email to the owner of the company thanking them for the opportunity and educational experience. Only a couple of paragraphs.The owner responded right away saying that I was a good team player and thanks for the help on set. My supervisors ignored my email.


What did I do wrong? Am I a bad employee? What could I improve on in my next job? Did I mess up?


Tl;dr: I feel like one of my supervisors nitpicks everything I do, but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs maybe because I‚Äôm not good enough.",22Feb2019,1

9,"First off, I‚Äôm a pathetic human being. Absolutely disgusting. 


I‚Äôll go to the beginning...
Growing up my parents hated each other &amp; we were so poor, my mom worked three jobs. My dad beat my mom, my mom cheated constantly. They split when I was 6, and not long after my brother (13 at the time) was killed in a very tragic accident. It ripped my family apart. My older brother was like a zombie, I was young and confused so I started acting out. My brother joined the marines and my dad took his anger about other brothers death on me. Trauma and grief change people I know. It was hard. My mom was never around, dad was so emotionally abusive it‚Äôs not even funny. I suffered from extreme anxiety and depression. If it wasn‚Äôt for my grandma I would‚Äôve killed myself. But I didn‚Äôt want to hurt her. I had a great best friend but I ditched her for the cooler girl who ended up using me until she just didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me anymore. 

Then I was 17, and I met a boy. He was a real piece of shit but I needed to be loved. Not long after I got pregnant so I quit going to school and moved stayed away with the boy, to live with my mom who was basically just blowing through all the money on random boyfriends from the lawsuit from my brothers death. 

Baby boy was born 6 days before my 18th. &amp; let me tell you I love that boy. He was my best dude. Not long after boyfriend left me for his boss and I packed up my nice life In a big fancy house to go back to Florida to live in my hoarding fathers double wide. (Pain was too much. Had to get away) 
6 months later I moved back in with my mom feeling better. (Never finished school and didn‚Äôt have a job but emotionally I was okay and ready for the world) immediately baby daddy found out I was back and started coming around. Didn‚Äôt really pay attention to him, but then my mom got a job where we were home alone and he lived close so he would stop by and check on us. Kiddo was a year and a half old at this point. 

Then I found out baby daddy was on meth and I helped him get off and over it. (He‚Äôs still sober btw 6 years later) I ended up taking him back, and then he left me for someone else.. took him back, left me again for a new person and I found out I was pregnant with kiddo number two. (I had a best friend named jacob at this point since kiddo number one was 8 months old  and we all moved in together) my mom was supporting me and i still hadn‚Äôt had my first job. Mom lost her house and was in debt and moved back to Florida and got a job working traveling and she would spend her home time with us. and baby daddy was working at the dollar tree so I just stayed home with the kids. I was so depressed and had developed social anxiety because of being humiliated every time by baby daddy. 

Baby number 2 comes and baby daddy leaves for someone new again. X3... the rejection and pain made me a social recluse. I never left the house, just me and the kiddos. I had no ambition to do ANYTHING. I just cried and held on to my babies. For TWO YEARS.

(Side note baby daddy has never spent a single dollar on either kid. 7 and 4 now) 

I still stay at home at my moms. We don‚Äôt go out, I never finished school and never got a job. My mom gives me 75 a week to take care of her house and I don‚Äôt get government assistance my mom got insurance on the boys through her work. So that buys our food and toys for the kids. I still have crippling anxiety and have gained a lot of weight. Well only 10 pounds but I never lost the weight I gained after the second baby. In 2017 after baby daddy broke up with his gf, I started sleeping with him. I was so lonely and sad idk why I did it. He ended up ending it to be with a 17 year old in high school. After one very unfortunate altercation at the grocery store between my (at the time 6 and 3 year old) I cut all contact. Then around Christmas I reached out and let him come see the boys. Just to find out his child bride left him. I slept with him again 3 times. I was just so lonely. I have no friends because the ones I do have ALWAYS WANT SOMETHING. I can never just be friends.  They need money or this and that. So I cut everyone out. I still haven‚Äôt had a job and I‚Äôm going insane. I‚Äôm lonely and bored and anxiously awaiting kiddo number 2 to start school in August. After being made fun of for so long by my baby daddy because i was tired of him telling me that I‚Äôm disgusting and him making fun of me and saying he would never love me that I would be better off dead. (I agree. I‚Äôve done nothing. 25 and just a stay a home pile of shit) I decided I would die today. He will never love me, my kids deserve better. Although I‚Äôve been there every step of the way. Never even spent a single night away from either. For the first time in FOUR years I left them with a babysitter for two hours two weeks ago to take baby dadddy to the hospital after he bruised the bone in his foot kicking a table at me and I was shaking  and anxious the whole time. 

It‚Äôs too late to do anything with my life. I‚Äôll never amount to anything and I should just end it before my kids notice what a disgusting pile of shit I am. 

If anyone reads this, I wish you a long happy life. I‚Äôve always been so kind to everyone. I just wanted to be loved my whole life. I only just now figured out I will never be worthy. ",22Feb2019,2
10,"I guess it doesn‚Äôt really affect me but my parents fight a lot. Not physical just about little things I guess. And I‚Äôve been noticing that she isn‚Äôt the same anymore, if that makes sense. She isn‚Äôt ever in the family room with us, or they just aren‚Äôt the same as they used to be. I don‚Äôt even know how it started or how I even noticed but basically, she is texting other dudes. Mind you, she‚Äôs engaged. From what I know it was like 2 people. At first it was ‚Äúhey‚Äù ‚Äútext me back?‚Äù And I was thinking oh maybe it‚Äôs just a friend because why would I think she was cheating? but then I started seeing things like ‚ÄúI love you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù and ‚Äúdo you miss me?‚Äù, not to my dad. I again kept making myself think it was a friend because I can‚Äôt think of that, and when I still do it makes me so sad. Well I knew it wasn‚Äôt just friends when I saw the pictures. They were basically nudes. It honestly broke my heart. And it‚Äôs not like I can just confront her about it! I just hope she stops doing it. Like the title says I just came here to get something off my shoulders. I hope I posted this to the right place. Maybe someone could give me advice? I‚Äôm almost 14 and just don‚Äôt know what to do... and I‚Äôm not depressed about it or anything just, confused? shocked? surprised? I don‚Äôt even know anymore. ",22Feb2019,3
11,"This is to me, hence the subreddit. I've decided I'm not going to make excuses anymore. I will keep it on my mind that my situation doesn't matter. I need to take responsibility for me. I will have to teach myself how, but I'm sure I'm capable.

In the past, I was spoiled and entitled. The kind where you decide you're a fucking philosopher instead of working. I didn't see what I was doing to me in the present, only what was done to me in the past. I didn't appreciate the people who were around, only was angry at the people who left. No one wants to be around an angry person who thinks they know everything.

I don't know when I became this person. I used to be kind, barely talk only listen, I used to be so empathetic that I could feel people's pain and ease it. I used to dance, play music, draw, and sit in nature. I had no choice in that, so I shouldn't have been so impressed with myself.

Today, all I wanted was to go to goodwill and get an old dress for a few bucks. My parents came and brought me a gift.( I made amends with them) They got a flat just 2 miles down the road in the rain. I asked my boyfriend of he could go help them. He got angry, and by the time he agreed my dad was back on the road. He was cursing up a storm, and punching his car. We show up at goodwill and they closed early. He forgot his cigarettes and his wallet. He had to turn around, and was so angry. He got up at 5:30 this afternoon. He acted like the whole world was against him, and I saw myself in that. I've been realizing that I'm a shitty person lately, and I'm literally choking on my dreams. I smoke cigarettes, and all I've wanted to do my whole life was make music. I don't care if I'm famous. I just want to make the things of beauty I hear inside my head. I want to share it.

If I look at the last 3 years, it's been drugs and lust. The misery has been growing so much as I dont do anything good for anyone but me. Even if I wanted to right now, I've trapped myself here. Now.... I need to find a way out that isn't death. Today sucked so bad, though my parents were so sweet, and I guess its life's gift to me. Misery... a reason to rethink my priorities.",22Feb2019,3
12,"So I'm not as popular or liked as most kids, being overweight and having a naturally loud voice does that to people. 

That also makes me a Target of the backwoods redneck jocks which believe picking on innocent kids makes them tougher. 

I usually never had this issue, but they decided to test their luck on me and come up and start insulting my friend who an incident went down with a couple months prior. 

This was a weak spot for me and had a very hard time coming up with a response to their laughs. So I went with the only thing I could think of on that track.

Sans is like the funniest joke in the world to our friend group and we quote him as a joke. So I knew what he said and when he said it. 

I probably didn't pull this off as smoothly as I thought I did, but it got the job done. 

After they were done laughing I told them I had a question for them as lazily as I could muster, probably looking like a floundering tuna. And then I pulled the bad time card, told them if they took another step forward they were really not gonna like what happens next. 

Laughing to his buds, he stepped towards and I shrugged, saying the 'welp, sorry old lady, this is why I never make promises' line. 

They stopped, not in fear or intimidation, but the type of confusion you get when a little kid tells you he's about to kick your ass. 

This gave me my perfect opportunity for my next move. I quickly readied myself and turned around and hauled ass as fast as my legs could take me. 

I got on the other side of the track before I stopped. I looked over at the group and they were all staring, probably in confusion. 

I didn't care, my mission was accomplished. 

Y'all can call it fake, but I'm remembering this one for a while. ",22Feb2019,1
13,"I am not from an English-speaking country so things here work differently. Anyway, I guess I have always been a jerk (and never realised it as I used to and sometimes still see myself as always correct). I guess I carried my jerk tendencies to my rotation and I failed it because of it.

I have been rude to my preceptor without realising it. It was only after that I told my friend about what I did that I've been informed that I've said was very rude. I have tried to behave professionally at the rotation ever since then but my preceptor still failed me with reason. 

Anyway, I don't think appealing for this mark is possible. Only one student is sent to a rotation site and nobody else from school was there to moderate it.

I can't help but ruminate about it. I guess I am wasting my friend's time and he got sick of it and he refused to talk to me this week. I guess ruminating can also not change my grade.

I am just so disappointed though. I guess I overestimated my ability due to my inflated ego. I was honestly expecting a better grade though as I got mostly neutral feedback in my most recent rotations and jobs. I also think failing a rotation is a bad thing given how I got extremely bad grades in the past and have been trying hard to avoid getting D's and C's this year. I've obviously failed this goal.

Tl;dr: I failed a rotation which isn't a requirement for graduation but counts for grades as I have been rude to my preceptor (the scariest thing is I didn't even realise that until recounting my experience to my friend later on as I tend to see myself as always correct). How can I move on? I doubt I can appeal for my grades.",22Feb2019,1
15,"Obviously hearing about school shootings is awful and makes you reflect on our reality as a whole sometimes, and the more you think about it the more heinous it becomes. The whole white kids are school shooters meme (which is based on statistics, but the amount of white kids that will shoot up their schools is basically nothing) has gotten out of hand. It‚Äôs no longer a joke. White kids genuinely have to watch their every fucking step if they‚Äôre not of a specific look. To be safe from school shooter comments, you must be: pretty attractive, wear certain bright clothing, talk a certain way and amount, etc.

Basically, I get these comments about being a future school shooter that really bother me sometimes. I‚Äôm friendly with a good amount of people, and I‚Äôm respectful and nice, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. I wear similar clothing all the time, black or plain white shirts, black pants or black jeans and plain things like that. It‚Äôs not a specific style or anything, just my preference. I also have a very steady voice without much inflection or enthusiasm a lot of the time, and I don‚Äôt smile a lot.

Because of this, I get these ‚Äúyou‚Äôd probably be the most likely to shoot up the school or kill people‚Äù comments that pile up and bother me. It just feels like a kick in the face. I didn‚Äôt do shit. People assume white kids can‚Äôt be bothered by this shit or something, can‚Äôt speak for anyone but I don‚Äôt like it. I promise you I‚Äôm not understating the circumstances to make these kids say this shit. Really. It‚Äôs always either ‚Äúschool shooter‚Äù or saying I look depressed. What‚Äôs going on?

17," Hello, everybody. I'm 15, F, and honestly looking for an outlet to talk to, from time to time.

( If you feel that I'm too young to have real things that stress me, that's okay as well.)

Continuing from the title, I agree with my grandmother. It's just a small part of me feels that I overthink things, not only due to the expectations of other people, but also because of the expectations I've placed in myself. 

There's a few things that I refuse to let myself become; I will not be like my mother, nor father. 

(I know my parents love me and I still love them. It's just that I've seen them not only hurt me, but the people that care for them the most. So, I will never let myself become like them.)

My mother, deep down, is a wonderfully sweet and tender person; albeit hotheaded. Her childhood was hell, with an overall shit mom and dad; as a result, she was diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses at an extremely young age. To cope with her family life and mental state, she then turned towards achohol and drugs (which were already available within the home).

My mom told me that her mother was a very sick person before she abandoned her kids; it was almost like she hated my mom for even existing.

In return, my mother swore she would never do that to her own family. But, y'know, I wouldn't be here complaining if she didn't.

Welp, she did. And as a consequence, majority of my memories of her consist of waiting for her phone calls, broken promises, and vists that never happened. But, recently, things had been starting to look up for our relationship. She went to a rehab facility, met a person whom she loved there, and started trying to get to a point where I could one day, live with her.

That would be all fine and dandy if she hadn't lied to me about, how 'good' the man she is dating was. I later found out that he had apparently been abusing her, and had been sent to jail because he assaulted her. Though, he soon convinced her to get those charges dropped.

I had tried to still give him the benefit of the doubt, to my surprise, my trust was betrayed. They then came to vist and stay with my grandmother and I, it was fine the first day; but, all hell soon broke loose.

The whole time they were here (over a week), they constantly had end of the relationship agruments. He would always threaten to leave, and she would always get on her knees, begging him to stay.

But, I, tried not to complain. I then, gave them some marriage counseling; trying to figure out why they were having problems.

Boy, did I fucking find out why.

See, my mom got a herniated disk, so the couple both decided that she would stay here for a while.
Okay, I was happy, really really happy. That happiness was gone the first day she arrived.

All of a sudden, she had randomly started to sweat buckets, and her face became extremely red and leathery; her face was very dry and peeling. It kinda looked like the aftermath of a chemical peel.

Then, for the rest of the day, threw up in the bathroom constantly. She tried to eat, but she couldn't even keep water down.

It terrified me, I thought that she had an allergic reaction to the pumpkin pie we ate; really, really naive of me.

No, it turns out that she and her boyfriend had done some 'dirty' meth together, before he left for his out-of-state job; which, after years of doing, she developed this reaction to it.

She told me this after, agreeing countless times, that it was just something she ate. This would've been fine, but she had made it a point to say that she wanted our relationship to be open and honest; hiding nothing, nor lying to each other.

 After all these years of lying to me, I had finally started to trust her again; fully, I had forgiven her for everything. But, she killed that. Honestly, she had already relapsed before she came to vist, which I already knew about. 
So, although her using drugs again had hurt me, she took advantage of my naive trust; and that hurts more than anything she could've stole or blamed me for.

Then, everything got worse. 

This time, due to her injury, she said that she was going to stay with me for a while. I guess she thought the same too, because she then continued to make promises she couldn't keep.

She and her boyfriend fought the whole time, she stayed withe me; not even exaggerating. Everyday, break up then back together. They yelled so loud that my grandmother was worried of a noise complaint.

She later told me that because of money related issues (pain pills are extremely expensive), that she would go back to using her drug of choice; heroin.
Oh, but not shooting up, snorting it instead. I still tried to be understanding, and continued trying to trust her. So, I told her it wasn't a problem with me, as long as she knew her bottom line.

Long story short, she led me to believe she wasn't shooting up, whilst being extremely irritable and hyper-critical of anything I did; Regardless of me not doing the same to her.

I found out about it all while she and her boyfriend were having a screaming match, on the phone, in the bathroom.

She was crying, so I walked in to ask if she was okay. Well, I looked down to see that damn familiar orange-capped needle, clearly about to be used.

Then she blamed everything on her boyfriend, saying it was his fault because of the names he called her, and the lack of trust he held in her.

I tried to be on her side about it, but after being constantly lied to, finding out the truth really broke me emotionally. I didn't know what to even say anymore, I just felt exhausted.

End of it all, she left with him for a couple days, came back to get her stuff, and left. Claiming that she just couldn't be here, that it was being in the house that caused it all.

We have barely talked since then, and the times I have, it was only requests from her to do things FOR her. 
At this point, I really don't know if I can handle talking to her anymore, as just hearing her speak makes me exhausted.

21,"This is a pretty long post so bare with me here.

Not too long ago I discovered r/orthotropics. Orthotropics are basically 2 expelled orthodtontists trying to prove and push people to the idea that oral posture makes a person good looking, not genetics. They say that if your tongue's resting position is not at the roof of your mouth (it has to be the whole tongue, not just the front) you have bad oral posture and probably ugly and have crooked teeth. They also push ideas that swallowing correctly and neck posture all relate to good looking faces and sharp jawlines. Also, if you're an adult the changes of your face when finally adapting to this right oral posture will be minimal since your facial development is much much slower in adulthood as opposed to childhood (I'm 18 years old).

A lot of people are convinced by this and the r/orthotropics subreddit is growing faster than ever before. Because everyone is getting so convinced and putting out 'success stories' I started to be convinced as well.

This made me extremely aware of how I looked, wondered if my oral posture was correct (my tongue does rest on the roof of my mouth mostly, but I don't know if 'mostly' is enough. I also don't have good neck posture at all) and panicked thinking that I the reason I have my facial flaws is because of something I didn't do when I was younger, not genetics. Thinking it was only genetics before comforted me in a way since I couldn't do anything about it but having that their is a possibility that my current looks were altered in a bad way because of my oral posture as a kid frightens me. All this made me focus on my face A LOT more and started noticing ""flaws"" in it that I didn't see as flaws before.

Their statements on why beauty is so important in today's world made me really upset. Many people in the comments on the Orthotropics YouTube channel as well as the subreddit claim that beauty is the most important thing a person can have and if you're not attractive you're in a major disadvantage in life and this disadvantage is caused by YOU not having good oral posture as a kid, not genetics. I knew that being ugly was a disadvantage in life before discovering this, but not as bad as they claim.

The last straw was a video posted on the Orthotropics channel named ""Why beauty is not in the eye of the beholder"" which he is pretty much pointing out that the flaws you get from not having correct oral posture is ugly for everyone and SYMMETRY IN THE FACE IS KEY for a beautiful face. I spotted a few comments on the video as well that people said ""the beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" was just a coping mechanism for ugly people and people agreed. Even though there were quite a few people that disagreed with the video, the like-to-dislike ratio was still pretty good on their end.

This made me notice a lot of asymmetries and flaws in the face that I had never noticed before. I noticed that my jaw on the right side of my face was bigger than on the left. Probably because of the jaw clicking I have on the right side and me preferring to chew on that side. I also noticed that my chin is a little more recessed than preferred, something that I never noticed before, I thought my chin was fine. I think my face is also a bit long, which according to them is another symptom of not having good oral posture.

Now I cannot unsee these flaws. I cannot see my jaw being bigger, even though I never saw that before, makes me feel deformed. I cannot unsee my chin and see it as normal. I cannot stop worrying if my face is too long or not. I'm not happy to have braces anymore and being excited to see the results since they wont eliminate my other apparently much worse flaws.

I want to see myself as a relatively attractive dude as I saw myself before I discovered orthotropics. I went to the gym and my physique was (is, although I've lost some mass) pretty good, but after discovering this I had no desire to go to the gym anymore and just feel depressed.

It's like this has made me develop body dysmorphia disorder because of this discovery. I was never really 'happy' with my looks before but I was getting rather content with it after receiving a really good compliment from a girl that hasn't seen me since I was 12 years old. She told me I got a lot more masculine and good looking and was amazed how much I've changed. That was probably the best compliment I've EVER received. But I can't take it as well anymore because of all this.

I just want to stop obsessing over my looks. I want to feel okay looking again, like I did before. I actually felt like I had a chance with girls. Now I feel like if I ever had a chance with a girl it's because they just settled with me since they themselves also couldn't get a better looking partner. I want that mindset out of my brain, but I don't know how.

How do I stop obsessing over this and just accept my looks instead of feeling terrible about myself? I wish I never discovered orthtropics, I want this to end.

TL;DR Obsessed over looks after discovering r/orthotropics and other likewise subs that focus on looks. Can't stop thinking about all the flaws I have after discovering that my right jaw is bigger than the left and bunch of other asymmetries that I never noticed before.

22,"2 months ago I was going through hell, I was unemployed, broke and completely lost, sold things I didn‚Äôt want to sell just to put food in my stomach and got so low I tried to kill myself. 

Worked my ass off... got through it somehow without getting evicted... I got it together. Forced a confident smile on my face. I got a decent job. 

Today I got the biggest paycheck I‚Äôve ever gotten in my life and I finally feel financially secure. Stress does absolutely terrible things to a human.

My coworkers have noticed and though I don't do it around people I do frequently punch myself in the head.  This habit only started recently (in the last 2 years).  IDK if I've done any real damage.  don't know why the swings happen, I'll just be thinking and my mind will wander to something that makes me mad.  Sometimes it'll be something that happened decades ago but more often it's totally made up things that never happened and won't ever happen.  Yet those are the ones that get me the maddest.

25,"My first girlfriend Alysha abused me by making me feel worthless and actually forced me to accept her lover as a part of our relationship.

My next partner Taylor cheated on me. Then the girl after that emotionally manipulated me and was horribly abusive as well as selfish. 

I dated a few girls after that, including Courtney who cheated too. Then I met my ex fianc√©e Jin, who cheated on me, neglected me, pressured me to go into debt buying her things, then dumped me and broke my heart. 

The next girl I dated Zoey robbed me of 3000$. 

The next one, Destiny, ghosted me. 

Then I dated this absolute bitch Fatema who used me and led me on for almost a year while she was cheating with men all over the internet. 

After that, I had a FWB situation where the girl immediately said she wouldn‚Äôt have sex with me anymore because a guy who ghosted her resurfaced. 

Then I started chatting to Kyla, who stood me up then ghosted me. 

I was never abusive, rude, or cruel. I was always genuine, polite, loving, affectionate, accepting, understanding, you guys can see my conversations if you don‚Äôt believe me. I poured my heart out to all of these women, giving them the utmost trust, and I always end up abused, humiliated, and hurt. 

Tell me why I should trust women. Tell me, why shouldn‚Äôt I give up on them? I can still be a feminist without trusting or letting any woman get close. Even if I can‚Äôt be, they probably don‚Äôt want *my* support anyways. 

Why should I set myself up to get hurt again and again and again? Let‚Äôs face reality. Some people don‚Äôt get a happy ending to life. Some people lose. 

I am one of those people. 

And it‚Äôs not about looks. I‚Äôm handsome - chubby but I make it work - and I have good hygiene.

I‚Äôm great with kids, I‚Äôm very relaxing and easy to be around, or at least I was before women gave me crippling abandonment issues, anxiety, and now paranoia is the newest addition to the party. 

I‚Äôm done giving people a chance. at least if I‚Äôm lonely no one can hurt me.

26,"I was born to a family of three, my mother, father, and older sister. We grew up in a town right next to the biggest City in our state. My father had seizures often due to health issues, causing my parents to divorce when I was three.

I ended up moving to a new town, same state, still living there at the time of writing this. I met some good friends, but never talked a lot, I was always the shy quiet kid growing up. 

When I was seven or eight, my mother married a man who seemed nice. They got along well, but I never really liked him. When I was 11, things went south. He started yelling at me, at this point I should note that I had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. It got to the point of Psychological and Emotional Abuse. Every night he‚Äôd yell at me for the most minor things. 

Two weeks after my twelfth birthday, I attempted suicide. I was sent into a psych ward. Then a step down program from the ward, then another ward after another attempt, then another step down, resulting in a process that lasted three months, five total programs and hospitals, and  15+ failed suicide attempts.

Five months after I left the hospital for good, the worst night of my entire life happened. My Step Father who visited me a total of once in my three-month trip to the hospital, went psycho. 

My mother was at a friend‚Äôs house. He went downstairs to get a beer or something, and I walked into the living room to get something. The Cable Box was unplugged, nothing major, would only take a second to plug in again. 

He thought it was me when he walked back upstairs and into the living room. He started yelling again. I said it wasn‚Äôt and got what I needed and headed back into my room. My sister came into my room, closed the door and called for my grandparent to pick me up since they lived less than a mile away.

I walked downstairs, and into the room right by the door. He pulled over a chair, and continued screaming his lungs out. Eventually my Grandfather came in, took me to his car, and my Grandad went back into our house, and, well he didn‚Äôt tell me what he did. I spent the night at his and my grandparents house. I‚Äôm not sure what happened to my sister either. 

Needless to say, eventually my Mother and Step Dad divorced.

A few years later here I am. Still in highschool, not a lot of friends but a few close ones. I‚Äôm known as one of the nicest kids in the school, as I don‚Äôt want anybody to feel what I did a few years back.

30,"I‚Äôve been having a hard time adjusting to ‚Äúreal life‚Äù post undergrad. I did so much work during my time in college for an academic career and it hasn‚Äôt paid off. I was president of an international honor society, won scholarships and was apart of a prestigious baccalaureate program. In my last semester I applied to 12 phd programs and 1 masters. 

Fast forward, I have been rejected to 8/12 PhD programs, rejected to 3 fellowships, and officiated at the doctors today that I have mild to moderate depression. I‚Äôm a few thousands in debt and I‚Äôm currently working two jobs (not related to my field) to gradually pay it off. I don‚Äôt presume I‚Äôll stay in this jobs for long so that‚Äôs decent.

Positives:
I have an international trip planned in the summer. I hope I enjoy it and I‚Äôm privileged and grateful to have this opportunity. 

Negatives: 
It might be a bad idea financially but I feel like I need it after so much hard work the past five years (I earned two degrees in the social sciences). 

I‚Äôm self loathing but it‚Äôs a continuous struggle to feel like my time and effort laying down foundation is worthwhile and being proud of my work.

I‚Äôm seeing a therapist tomorrow, awaiting to hear back from 4 programs, going to finish my prolonged baccalaureate thesis, and start my second job on Tuesday.

I‚Äôm sorta happy these things are lining up but I think my sense of feeling positive emotions are dulled a little.

Sure, I need a job, but this is only temporary. Something else will come along sooner or later, someone will see potential in me, and I will be on my way to writing a new chapter. No job is perfect, but I want to find something that I like, at least a little bit. 

The millennial in me wants to chase something that inspires me. Or at least seems somewhat exciting. Does work have to feel like my own personal hell every day? 

Is it naive to chase happiness for a job that might not fulfill me, or even exist? But what if it DOES? 

I‚Äôm tired of feeling tired, I‚Äôm done feeling sad. I‚Äôm done feeling trapped. There are other opportunities out there, plenty more career fish in the sea. I‚Äôm not asking for a wicked tuna here, but maybe just not something so...toxic. Life is too short to feel this way. I may not be perfect. But I have a lot to offer. 

I was happy and bubbly and full of wonder before all of this, but this job has really gotten me down. And I want to feel like that girl again. I know I can, I just need to believe there is something else. Not just anything else, but something out there for me.

34,"To preface this. she's my half sister. Today I got into an argument with my step mom and in the middle of it she interrupts telling me to shut up. She let slip that she hates me.

I pretty much figured this as she already didn't talk to me and was pretty cold towards me, but it's finally come out. She's finally said it.

She hates me.

I've tried being nice to her the whole time I've lived here (couple months now), but every now and again I let my old personality come through and that's something I've been trying to avoid.

I wonder if my other step/half siblings feel the same way?

I've been crying about this for over 20 minutes now, because it hurts. Having someone that's supposed to be family finally tell you that they hate you? I've been alienated in the past by my family before but they've never told me they hated me. I actually do not know how to cope with this.

I just figured making a throwaway and letting it out would help with that. . . Nope. Still crying. Still feel like shit.

36,"So last summer I went on an educational trip abroad and it was probably one of the best experiences of my life. During the trip I met somebody who had a great impact on my life (at least throughout the trip and the following months to come). 

 I remember the last night of the trip, all of the participants (there were like 10 of us) had a sleepover in one our hotel rooms. It was just a cliche and fun way to bond over how close we had all gotten and to celebrate our last night today before parting ways. After everyone had fallen asleep, my friend and I stayed up until like 4 in the morning just talking and having a deep talk. It was so strange to feel so close to somebody who I had only met 10 days before. It felt so great to just be able to talk freely and openly. I don‚Äôt know why but talking late at night into the early hours of the morning is just so ... different. Everything becomes closer and more intimate. 

 I know that this friend and I will never be able to talk like this ever again because after the trip we reverted back to our separate worlds. It‚Äôs a memory that I look back on fondly but it also makes me feel quite sad. I miss him so much. I would do anything to have another late night deep talk with him again.

I was laying down in my bed. My dog was laying next to me. As I tried to fall asleep a bad feeling came over me. I became anxious and restless and I got my Bible and began to read it. My stomach felt bitter and I knew it was the Lords urging. I could only imagine what might have happened if I had fallen asleep. Earlier in the night starting around 12:18 pm I began to hear faint noises in the living room, which is right by the front door. I remember thinking:  ‚Äúit sounds as if someone is messing with the doorknob.‚Äù I dismissed it as paranoia. 

I began to get worried when I realized my dog was hearing the noises as well. I again, dismissed the nagging thought as maybe one of my reptiles making the noise. Around 12:58 p.m I heard a creak in the living room and I knew it was the door opening. Since my door was broken (had been kicked in a day prior), I had a chair jammed between the door and a small closet in the hall. It was semi sturdy and would give 4-5 inches if someone tried to open it, but it would go no further. Thinking it was maybe Michael trying to come in (he had left previously that day, so whoever done this had to have been watching) I ran down the hallway and ripped open the door. I looked both directions and heard somebody running down the hallway and down the stairs. As they ran I noticed their footsteps were light, so they knew what they were doing. Normally, my stairs are very loud because they are the ‚Äúsuspended‚Äù kind. It‚Äôs very difficult to run down them without being extremely loud with big thuds. I shouted at them but heard nothing. Michael has proven that it wasn‚Äôt him. The part that bothers me the most is that I knew whoever was attempting to get in had vicious intentions. Because I was in my bedroom and the light was on, clearly visible from the road. So this wasn‚Äôt a robbery or something petty, they knew I was home and possibly awake. Meaning they were planning on overpowering me and my son. A pretty bold move, playing on the assumption that I‚Äôm not paying attention. I thank the Lord that I wasn‚Äôt asleep and that I had jammed the door. And grateful I didn‚Äôt go after whoever it was. Someone had been messing with the doorknob. It was unlocked (even though the lock was broken I kept it locked to fool people). They must have tried the handle, picked the bottom lock and slowly opened the door hoping the top wasn‚Äôt locked.

45,"I've been dealing with panic disorder and depression (as well as Aspergers, but that's not relevant) for as long as I remember, but didn't seek out help until about 8 years ago (mostly due to having it drilled into my head that there was nothing wrong with me, I was just lazy, I needed to get out more, etc). I was on medication for my panic disorder for about a year, and tried four different depression meds over the same period. 

The panic disorder medication didn't help, but I noticed my panic attacks weren't as frequent as they used to be (and so far, haven't been, although I get the odd one from time to time). The depression meds were awful. One killed my sex drive, one amplified my suicidal thoughts, and the other two killed my creativity. I tried another medication for panic disorder about a year later, and it did the same: killed my creativity, and made me feel like a robot.

I feel like things come and go. I go through periods of feeling either really good, or really terrible, and it doesn't seem there's an inbetween. Lately though, it's just been bad. I can't do much but isolate. I find it impossible to drive further than the store (or drive at all). I can't focus on anything. My mind feels cloudy. And it's affecting my work, and it's starting to really bring down my performance.

Here's the thing: I work in a creative field. My ability to make money is tied to my ability to be creative. When I lost it with medication, I lost my first job. I worked in a grocery store for about two years after. So it's a catch-22: be creative and unfocused, or be well and uncreative.

I've been to two therapists in the last two years. The first one didn't seem to care what I had to say, and would kind of passive-aggressively berate me when I would try to shift the conversation to the actual issues I was having. The other one wasn't very professional. She lost her temper and cried a lot, and eventually got fired for walking out of a session with another patient. So I don't have a great outlook on that so far as a means for help.

It's almost a cliche, isn't it? The whole tough appearance as a defence mechanism for a vulnerable human. This to some extent has helped me because whatever has my name behind or attached to it, I take a lot of extra care, caution and pride in my work. But when I do mess up... and I do, I get anxious, stressed out and really feel bad. 

Today is one instance where brushing it off isn't really something I can do. It's eating me up inside. An email was sent at work, with quite literally ALL the biggest bosses in my company in the thread making a request for several departments to help an emergency company wide initiative. This explains why the heads of all the departments were CC'd. 

I misread what was sent, thinking they were asking if we had already done anything related to it, but what they meant was to ask for what our ideas/initiatives were. So I said no. That I checked and our department wasn't doing anything on it. 

My immediate boss freaks out. Texts and asks me to do it. And obviously I had intended to do it, just that I misinterpreted the message. So stupidly careless, in front of all the top dogs.

49,"Long story:

When I was young, my family moved from New York to Florida. My sister hadn‚Äôt been born yet, and I didn‚Äôt really know anyone when we first moved. It was a lonely time.

Until I opened a little shoe box on the floor of our living room on Christmas Eve. We‚Äôd just gotten back from a pizza buffet. My parents said Santa came early just for me. I gingerly lifted the lid, which was slightly open. Out popped a little white and gray kitten with a red bow. It was love at first sight.

Since that day, we were inseparable. Through every move, through every phase of my life, China was there. My shadow. We spent pretty much every moment together even as I aged. She liked eating Cheetos and curling up on my chest when I went to sleep. She would come downstairs sometimes and lay next to me when I played video games. She was slightly skittish and was very particular about who she liked, and I was her one and only. She had a squeaky meow and a loud, comforting purr. And she looked at you. She really looked into your soul when you exchanged glances. It was a bond I‚Äôll probably never experience again.

I moved away from home at 20. During this time, she and I were apart for a few months as my apartment didn‚Äôt allow pets. But eventually, I moved into a house and she and I started our new journey with my now husband. She settled in nicely. Life got busy after that, between college and work and unfortunately the wrath of my depression.

Time was slipping away. She got sick in February of 2016. But she pulled through. I held my breath. May 1, I woke up and knew something was wrong. She was dragging herself across the floor. My husband and I looked at each other and just knew it was time. She spent her last moments and took her last breath in my arms. I will never forget the moment I saw her body rise and fall for the very last time. 

We had a burial for her in the backyard of our old house. I wanted to cremate her, but at the time, my husband and I were broke college students. And now I regret that.

As time has gone on, my sadness has decreased, but it comes and goes in waves. In the little moments of life, I miss China. I wish she was there for my wedding. My graduation. My career. She was more than a cat to me. We‚Äôve moved houses since, and we‚Äôve lived there for about a year. 

I had an anxiety attack around midnight last night, realizing I‚Äôd left her at the old house. I couldn‚Äôt stop focusing on this, focusing on how I abandoned her. 

My husband and I talked it over and he said he‚Äôd love to be able to take her with us whenever we move again. He said we could exhume her grave and see what happens. If I can‚Äôt at least get her bones, we can take some soil from her burial ground, just to have something.

I posted this not only to vent but to get others‚Äô opinions. I‚Äôm not even sure if vets can cremate after a pet has already been buried. Part of me is so nervous that we won‚Äôt find any remnants of her and I‚Äôll be so disappointed. But I feel like I need to at least try.

That's it.

It's a fucking nightmare that you have to live every fucking day..and don't you DARE think that life is sunshine,rainbows and fairy tale bullshit..**IT'S NOT.**

I hate politics.

I hate reality.

And I don't think that it's right to go to countries that are going to become fucking killing fields.

In fact:

I think there should be a travel ban for both South Korea and Japan because of North Korea.

And let me elaborate why:

1-As time goes on,trump is going to be increasingly likely to do some exceedingly crazy shit to try and keep himself in power/protect himself from Mueller and the dems...and going to war would not be outside the realm of possibility(including a..Nuclear war)...and one of those crazy fucking things may be going to war with North Korea(whatever the hell China does in response be damned)

2-This upcoming summit..I have a HUGE fucking feeling it's gonna be an abstract fucking disaster..The.U.S is VERY clear about North Korea's nukes,and you don't tell the United States of America the word ""No""...lest you end up a crater,that is.

3-It seems that there is widespread belief that North Korea could obliterate Both South Korea and Japan with very,very little issue(according to many media outlets and those in the government).

4-At this point,it seems that If you go to either South Korea or Japan:You'll die. Full stop. Because evidently and apparently,Not a single entity on the planet earth can stop North Korea from nuking anyone they want.

So,therefore..I strongly believe that perhaps until North Korea is sorted out,one way or the other,A travel ban for all civilians(not military and/or government) should be in place for both South Korea and Japan.

Because,It really seems that it's not safe to go to South Korea and/or Japan..unless you want a violent Nuclear death(incineration) by North Korea nuke. And I Strongly believe that there is no point in going to countries that are going to be killing fields VERY soon because one American President wants to save his presidency and has ZERO regard for human life.

You go to South Korea and/or Japan,one of them will be your grave..if you're lucky and don't end up having to be buried in a..coke can,that is.

Fuck North Korea.

56,"I never thought I would write about my experience because, to be honest, I‚Äôm not sure what really happened. However today (22nd February) appears to be World Encephalitis Day and I thought it would be fitting to share my story about such an unfamiliar yet deadly disease. 

Summer 2018, I had packed up my life in London and stopped by home in Geneva before setting off to a new start in Hong Kong (little did I know I was about to embark on a completely different type of ‚Äònew start‚Äô). It was a summer filled with emotions, saying goodbyes and hellos, with my sister‚Äôs wedding going on and family visiting from near and far etc. As the days were nearing my departure date, I began to feel more stressed and excited at the same time. 

See, the problem was that I‚Äôm already quite crazy in nature so no one would have suspected any unusual behaviour at the time. Therefore, the early onset of typical symptoms I was exhibiting were only realized in retrospect after the events unfolded: 

‚ÄúDo you hear that music? It‚Äôs like a flute guiding me‚Ä¶I can hear this song playing all the time, why can‚Äôt I turn it off in my head?‚Äù ‚Üí auditory hallucinations. 

‚ÄúMa, I know the truth now, I know who God is and Abbu is the prophet. Everything makes sense now.‚Äù ‚Üí hyper-religiosity. ‚ÄúI need to do this NOW! There is no other choice!!‚Äù ‚Üí obsessiveness. 

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt feel my right arm‚Ä¶ oh my god I literally can‚Äôt write anymore! How am I going to teach if I can‚Äôt write???‚Äù ‚Üí movement disorder. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm twitching in my lips‚Äù ‚Üí seizure-like symptoms. 

I threw up almost 13x in a day for a few days during that period. Enough physical symptoms led me to a first doctor visit. The doctor put me on an IV drip, said it was an infection and it would pass away. I felt a bit better, but as I felt ill again I convinced myself of a truth‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúCAN YOU BELIEVE IT? A SCAM doctor in Geneva?! I am shocked that a city like this would even let someone like that in this profession! He gave me fake medicine! It‚Äôs him that made me ill! He‚Äôs trying to kill me! Better call Saul!‚Äù ‚Üí delusions and paranoia. 

I felt the need to inform everyone about this scam doctor, at which point my family decided to take my phone from me because I wasn‚Äôt making sense anymore. 

My extremely intuitive mother rightfully decided that I was not to take the plane to Hong Kong, and instead I was admitted to the hospital emergency. Unlike many patient stories that I have read regarding being misdiagnosed for mental health problems, I was enormously lucky that the doctors had picked up funny signals from my MRI scan. This meant they knew it was an underlying neurological issue and they quickly put me on anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial medicine. Through later tests, they were able to rule out that it was not a virus or bacteria, but indeed an inflammation of the brain i.e. encephalitis. Which type of encephalitis was still unknown, but later it would be discovered and for most of us as something entirely unheard of. 

My siblings, namely my sister and her newlywed husband, attended to me the first week I was in hospital. Mind you, I literally just met him for the first time. This week was the most arduous for anyone to witness. My parents were prevented from seeing me in such an awful state that can only described as something out of an exorcist film. Inexplicable hateful words, an unrecognizable voice, running out trying to escape from the hospital‚Ä¶ all of it. Unsurprisingly I had to be strapped down neck to toe, like a madwoman in a mental hospital. The psychosis stage. 

The following stage is called catatonia. This is where a patient becomes unresponsive, unconscious and totally withdrawn from their surroundings. Only very close friends and family were allowed to visit now, though it threw them off course completely, rendering nothing but grief and shock at first sight. No one understood how or why this happened, only that it was happening. What was to come next? How long would I be like this for? 

They predicted I would be in the hospital for 6 months, but unbelievably I was only there for one. Why? The incredible doctors of Geneva took to my care and did every possible test including EEGs, MRIs and gynecology exams to try to identify exactly what I was going through and a possible cause. Teams of magical staff members scrutinized my case to get to the bottom of it. After several test results, 3 weeks into the hospital, I was diagnosed with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. What a mouthful right? With a sigh of relief, the doctors immediately put me on the Rituximab drip. 

When I came to, I awoke to loving people around me. It took me a while to recognize faces at first, but it took me a while longer to realize what more I had to learn. This attack on the temporal lobe meant I had forgotten my ability to speak, read, write and walk, to name a few. I had all types of therapists ranging from speech, ergonomic, occupational, neurological, who all helped me return to a normal life. The appreciation I have for everyone at this hospital, with the best medical practitioners and top-line medicine, is unworldly. Without their support I would not have recovered as miraculously as I did, in the timeframe that I had done so. It really makes you think how underappreciated their services are yet how they save millions of lives. 

Science plays one part of my recovery story, but another part I firmly believe in is the spiritual healing I received. Angels. People from near and far, strangers I did not know, people who don‚Äôt even believe in God were all praying for me all around the world and believed in my recovery. Candles were lit every night and even animals were sacrificed in my name (I happened to fall ill during the holy month of Ramadan). Of course there were those people who came to see me Every. Single. Day. Took weeks or months off of work to be by my side. And there are those who came to take care of them too. The power of prayers is really something extraordinary that it is impossible to ignore during such an unfathomable incident. 

People always ask me ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt it scary? To have undergone such a traumatic experience?‚Äù The truth is that the real heroes are everyone else around me who had to endure this. I, on the other hand, was wallowing away at nothing but a dream‚Ä¶ or rather, one hellish nightmare. I can only come out of this feeling extremely grateful about all the right ingredients that fell into place- the fact that I got ill in my hometown and not in some foreign land, the speed at which I was diagnosed and then recovered, the facilities available to me, the amount of love and support surrounding me. My experience lies more in the after-story. It‚Äôs been 6 months and I have returned to work and a ‚Äònormal‚Äô life. Will things ever go back to completely normal? Maybe, but one thing has certainly changed and that will never go away‚Ä¶ I am a survivor. So you can be too.",22Feb2019,6

60,"Petro Canada is a company owned by SunCor and i've about had it with their shitty customer service. Im really upset with how everything was dealt and i needed somewhere to vent about my experiences. 

Please do not support this kind of behaviour and stop purchasing Petro Canada season passes. Use shell if you can or esso.

Thought id share my experience here -- recently i went to a petro canada near my house to wash my car. I buy the season pass, i have for the past 7 years. My father and I share the pass and we wash teh cars alternating days. Recently the petro near my house has been closing a lot (on a given week they will be closed 4 out of 7 days). I was fed up of the days passing and my car having a lot of salt so i went inside and if you didnt know -- if the petro near your house is closed you can request for a free wash for that missed day ... well when i went inside the attendant was refusing to give me a wash ... I told him it was in the guidelines and he literally starts raising his voice at me telling me ""Its not my problem the car wash is closed"" 
I bounced back at him telling him that i expect 90 days of service when i purchase this and because his car wash is closed it is his problem. He should reimburse me for the day by giving me a wash stub as outlined by petro Canadas rules when you purchase the wash. 

He tells me again its not his problem and i should go wash my car somewhere else. (FYI the next closes wash is about 8 kms away, and whats the point of me going to wash my car to come back with a salt stained car) 
I tell him it is not my problem because his wash is always broken, he should fix it or not offer the wash service. He then tells me he can open up the wash for me but if my car gets damaged its my problem. Like what is wrong with this man? 
I tell him to give me the pass or i would be calling to his manager to complain. He tells me to basically screw my self and call his manager he doesnt give a s*it. So it ell him you know what im going to call petro canada and he says ""Fine here take it"" and starts like muttering things under his breath. 

OK i think whatever he gave me the wash i dont give a shit.

2 days later my dad goes to wash his car and surprise surprise its closed again ... he goes in and asks for a stub because at this point neither him nor I have washed our cars for 4 days and what do you think happened next?

The guy literally told my dad to go wash it somewhere else and that he wouldnt be giving him a wash. He started yelling at a 65 year old man that because the wash was closed it was not his problem and he didnt have to do anything. (it wasnt weather related, this wash is just always breaking down)

Im not sure if its a training from corporate down or just this location and i mainly interact with this location because its close to my house .. but petro has really hit the shitter. I called in to complain after the guy yelled at my dad and all i got from their customer service department is that ""I will relay information to the owner, thats all i can do""

Jeez petro thanks for offering a service and not standing behind it. 

Needless to say 7 years ends this year I will use whatever days i have left and be switching over to the shell slightly out of my way down the street. 


Point of this thread: Awareness at how shitty petro is and i hope people open up their eyes to not allow shitty customer service to be around. We work hard for our money and if you want my business you better work for it too.

If you do notice shitty customer service, report it. THey might nto do anything but they atleast will know that there are a lot of unhappy customers and that might force them to change their attitudes.",22Feb2019,1

64,"A year ago, my parents told me I had 5 months to get out. I managed to quickly find two roommates and a lease and things were good. Then one roommate's car broke down, and he still owed money on it. He didn't have the credit to get another car with his negative equity, so wanting to be a good person (and needing him to get to work so he could pay the bills) I cosigned an inflated car loan. (Yes, I know. I'm young, and I've since learned to never help anyone like this again)

Then things were good again. Except winter was coming around and his hours started to get cut. This was when I learned that he genuinely does not care where life takes him and does whatever takes the least effort to get by. We're all equals on the lease, so when he couldn't afford to pay rent (because he never bothered to look for a second job) he just asked us to spot him. Thanks to joint liability, there wasn't much choice. Then he decided to not keep track of his car payments, which I only found out about after my otherwise stellar (for 21) credit report told me I had missed payments. He never said anything about it because he doesn't care about his credit, or mine. Then he decided insurance was too expensive, so that got cut, and apparently the highway during a blizzard is the best place for a FWD sedan to be, so now the car is barely drivable, let alone sellable.

Yesterday I found out that he was let go from work because he doesn't understand the concept of a start time. That was the last straw. I told him that I have no problem taking us both down, and if that means getting us evicted then so be it. I'm not paying his rent anymore. I know he's gathering enough money for March, but I don't know how he plans to pay after that, and while I acted brave, I really do care about my credit, not only because I planned out my future, but I need security clearance for my job and bad credit takes that away. I barely make enough each month to cover myself and maybe stash away a hundred dollars. I'm selling my motorcycle, trying to get rid of my Jeep, and realizing that I'd never be in this mess if I had just learned this about him in the first place.

The other roommate and I have decided that we can't kick him out, but we can kick us all out, and we plan to abandon the lease and find somewhere else to live. At the very least the effect on my credit will be minimal. But I'm still stuck with this loan for probably another 5 years because I know he'll never go out of his way to release me.

I've never felt stuck like this before. I always have a plan for everything, but apparently no plan can beat this level of single-minded determination to take everybody down with you. If I make it out of this, I don't know how I'm going to trust anyone with anything again.

68,"After a traumatic event in my life when I was 15, I suffered a great depression paired with PTSD. I deleted all social media, cut off every single person in my life, and shut myself in the house for 3 years. (Left my school and was homeschooled as well)

83,"Some time in the first 2 years of high school, you should have, like, a semester's worth of‚Ä¶ I don't know‚Ä¶ how-to-research-the-job-you-want training. Like, before you get to that point in Junior/Senior years where you're inexplicably competing to with a bunch of people you're never going to see again to get into the coolest college, you should get pulled aside by some faculty member and asked‚Äî or maybe have a class where you stand up and tell all your classmates‚Äî what you want to be when you grow up, and then you spend the rest of the semester figuring out the best way to pursue that goal.

Maybe some people wouldn't have an answer right away, but if the question is open-ended enough, the amount of people who literally can't answer is probably going to be pretty low. Most people will probably talk dream jobs, but a few might just have life goals: Have a bunch of cats, have some kids and have time to engage with their kids' activities, travel a bunch etc. The point would be to get students inquiring how to actually pursue their life goals, at a point before they've been convinced college is the one and only way to pursue those goals. Even if you go through the entire semester without answering the ""what do I want to do with my adult life"" question, you're better-equipped to figure out how to pursue that later on when you do figure it out.

The rest of the program could include things like looking up job listings for your dream job and figuring out how to parse the requirements; getting in contact with people who actually have the job and learning from them\*, compare experiences of people doing the job at big companies, small companies, independently, for contract etc.; learning about tangentially related paths; where you might have to (or be free to) move if you pursue this path. Probably a million other things.

Bonus points:

* The faculty would get better and better each time they teach this class; they would be learning from their students. Someone may have a dream job they've never heard of, but by helping them research it, they'll have better answers the next time someone comes through wanting to do that.

* I suggested possibly doing this as a whole class or one-on-one; I think there are benefits to both, and a big benefit to the whole-class version is that the whole class's input could probably help get richer results. That dream job none of your teachers are familiar with? The kid in the second row might have a cousin who's doing that very job. Need ideas for companies to research, while maybe one of your classmates' favorite movie or app or whatever is made by a company you never would have thought to research. That said, some people may benefit more from the privacy of not telling their peers that they're maybe interested in something weird or different, so the one-on-one approach is probably better.

------

I would have killed to have gotten this sort of experience when I was in high school. I knew my dream job since, God, I don't even remember how young I was, third or fourth grade maybe? Younger? Whenever it was that my brother's friend showed me *The Art of Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi*. That's when I knew that I wanted to be a concept artist, making a bajillion designs that ultimately get rejected while steadily narrowing it down to the versions that people finally see on the big screen; making all these crazy alternate universes of my favorite movies and games full of different versions of the creatures and props and sets that only the die-hard fans who seek them out would ever see; creating those amazing, simple paintings like Joe Johnston and Ralph McQuarrie and countless others made.

But, at whatever age I was then, I had no idea how to pursue that goal. Worse, I had no idea how to learn how to pursue that goal. I must have been in junior high, in the early days of the Internet, when I googled my favorite game studios and wrote some crappy emails to their generic contact email addresses. Looking back, it's unsurprising that I got corporate non-answers from them. I wasn't contacting the artists; this was before Twitter, before any social media, before you could get in touch with anyone by typing an @ followed by their name.

So, not knowing any better, I did what I always did: I set it aside and figured I would learn what I needed to know at the *right* time. I didn't realize until too late, how ill-prepared anyone I would know for a very long time was going to be at helping me find my dream job, how far away that *right time* was actually going to be. No one ever asked, so no one could prepare me until all the wrong ideas had ossified into *incontrovertible fact*. I wanted to make games, so I looked for schools that had majors involving games. I knew I had been a terrible student, so I treated it as a black mark on any school that would actually offer me a scholarship. I went for prestige and a program that had nothing to do with getting me the job I'd dreamed of since age 7 (and still dream of at age 30). And it wasn't until I was about to graduate from that program that I had stubbornly persisted with, that *anyone* even thought to tell me that no one was going to care about my degree, but rather about the quality of my artwork.

Obviously, almost a decade out of my miserable college experience, more deeply entrenched in a sharing culture than even existed back when I first started wanting this gig, I have a better idea of how to actually get my dream job. But I still can't help imagining how much more quickly and easily I could have gotten there if, instead of going tens of thousands of dollars into debt to get a degree I didn't need, I had learned how to research this dream. How, for a fraction of the cost, I could have had a nice computer and a few dozen good tutorials to follow. How much less difficult it would have been to do the work in my late teens and early twenties, without needing to also be searching for immediate, shitty, pay-the-bills jobs that I will dread going to. How much better off I would be if I had just known how to figure out how to find my dream job before clinical depression set in and moving back in with my parents for the second time in my adult life happened.

I hope, if we're not already doing it in schools, we start doing something like this in schools before more kids repeat my mistakes.

\* I know, a lot of professionals seem to hate when colleges make their students do this. But I imagine that high school kids doing this as part of a slightly more independent study would be better received. At this point, the high school kids haven't already fucked themselves with 4 years worth of student loans (yet, we'll have to wait and see how much more insane the US gets with paying for school in the coming years), and it comes at a point when there's more time and freedom for the student to experiment: Start learning the skills they need before everything's on the line, change their mind if it's not for them etc.",22Feb2019,1

I knew it was a useful tool to communicate to others when you were pressed for time, or couldn‚Äôt talk at the moment, but I always snobbishly looked down on those who communicated to others ECXLUSIVELY through it.

My way of thinking back then was, *‚ÄúI‚Äôm old school. Phones are primarily for talking. Verbal communication should always be the main route to go. Save the txting for when it‚Äôs vital/absolutely necessary.‚Äù*

*TALKING* to another person on the phone is what‚Äôs meant to happen. How it‚Äôs supposed to be. This txting thing has got to calm down.

In the last few years, I‚Äôve done a bit of a turnaround on this way of thinking. In that, I‚Äôve almost completely cut off talking on the phone unless its to someone I have to talk with.

One person starts to ramble on &amp; on, never letting the other in, and when they try, the other person talks over them, steamrolling over them to where they can hardly get a word in.
________________________________________________________________________
All of those potential issues are done away with when txting. You get your point &amp; messages across succinctly, and with no extraneous ‚Äúfat‚Äù. No uncertainty. What you have to say in response is right here to be read. If you mess something up, or meat to restate/retract something, you can let the other person know about it right after. 

You have *time* to organize your thoughts and plan your reply back. With talking, its all there on the spot, you need to be quick, on-point, and have your mind locked right away. With txting, you have time advantage to plan &amp; get your brain adjusted to whatever comes your way. You‚Äôre less ‚Äúon the spot‚Äù, and you can reread and make sure your message to them is just how you want it.
_______________________________________________________________________

You can actually pace yourself, and get your thoughts all figured out, as opposed to talking on the phone, where you need to come up with interesting add-ons and sentences right here on the spot.

Too long of a wait between talking back, too much dead air between talking, and it just gets awkward &amp; uncomfortable. (*‚ÄùOh is it my turn to talk now?‚Äù*)

It‚Äôs just way too chaotic a thing to do. When txting first came around, I wasn‚Äôt a fan of it. I thought it was best just used as a ‚ÄúNeed-To‚Äù only thing. But having talked to people on the phone since in the years between then &amp; now, txting only makes it‚Äôs problems more apparent.

87,"I promise this isn't a humblebrag or anything. I'm not overweight, I'm right where I should be, or I used to be. Now I could be considered *under*weight. In the last month I've lost almost 30 lbs without changing my diet or exercising. And I'm still losing weight. It's worrying me to the point of anxiety and stress. And every single time I bring it up with family or friends because I'm worried, they always respond with either ""at least you're not gaining weight/you should be happy,"" or ""wish I could lose some weight/I need to lose some weight, too.""

I'm not telling them this because I'm proud of the weight loss. I'm not telling them this because I'm trying to brag. I'm telling them because I am worried for my health. I tried explaining that to them, but they always brush over it like it doesn't matter. Someone even got upset because they thought I was flaunting it in their face. I told them that I'm scared and I got the ""ugh"" and eyeroll. This is adding to my stress and I just needed to get this out.",22Feb2019,432
88,"Okay, throwaway account for abvious reasons.

Every since I started antidepressants my libido has gone through the roof. And I've been questioning my sexuality quite a bit. I've always watched gay porn a lot, always justified it as ""lesbian porn is boring"" or ""all straight porn is some incest shit"". But recently I started thinking ""oh shit, what if i am gay/bi""

I did actually hook up with a guy before, though I always thought it went badly because I was super nervous. So just now I downloaded grindr, found someone who always used condoms. And met up. First off, it was in his van which was dodgy anyway. And then we started. And I honestly hated it, I don't regret it, because it's proved to me that I'm definately not gay or even bi. But it was just awkward, there was a couple good moments I suppose. But the main thing was, I could barely get hard and I couldn't finish. Like at all. Everything felt weird, oral was disgusting, kissing just felt weird, penetration hurt and he didn't even last a minute. The whole thing was just bad. And then he tried to hold my hand on the drive back.

But yeah, even though its completely not me, I don't regret doing it. I had to see if I was gay/bi or not. But again, totally not my thing. ",22Feb2019,5
89,"yes, this is about aa relationship. nothing about this post is rational, this - what you are seeing here - is just emotional pain, written into digital text.

i fucked it up. that hurts the most. she did not reject me, my looks, me as a person: but i just behaved in unacceptable ways, ways that would make it for her unreasonable hard to stay with me.

i will learn from this. i will grow out of it. i will meet girl sin the future and be like "" omg she is amazing "". but right now, i do feel none of th√°t. right now, it just feels like i fucked up. it just hurts. it hurts so bad. why did i behave this way, why can't i just NOT do things?

93,"So my doctor hasn‚Äôt been able to refill my SSRI for a while bundle of reasons, for an entire 5 days. I‚Äôve gone without it, cold turkey. And I‚Äôm really struggling.

My brain thinks one thing, but my body feels another way. I was really looking forward to spending time with a new friend, but one slight and very unimportant misunderstanding with my  boyfriend over the phone sent me into such a spiral that I cancelled and I‚Äôm just in bed with the dog eating junk food.

My boyfriend and I talked and he told me it would be okay, but honestly, depression always makes me feel like I‚Äôll end up all alone and it will be my fault because it makes me difficult to handle at times.

94,"No. They were degrading and rude. They did not respect me. They slapped my ass. They suggested sex with me in front of their girlfriend. I cannot believe you want me to keep a person in my life who acts like this. That they treated me poorly was not unknown to you. You suggested he slapped my ass in an innocent gesture and suggested I should consider his point of view. I cannot believe that having boundaries and set expectations of decency in the people I see is viewed as a personal failing ‚Äúthat you might want to work on in therapy.‚Äù I cannot believe how dismissive you are about my negative experiences and that you sided with this scumbag. And how dare you lump this creep in with me distancing myself from someone I care about while they figure out a few things and say I ‚Äúpush people away.‚Äù Like I haven‚Äôt been doing my damndest to get out there and make good friends.

99,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm 19 years old, and I failed my driving test once again. 

It‚Äôs so embarrassing that my mom has to drive me everywhere. Worse is that if I don‚Äôt pass by August, I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll get to school (I‚Äôll be going to a university farther away). My mom said she‚Äôd hire someone to drive me, but she doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be an issue because we have time. I have like three more tries until then, and I‚Äôve never heard of anyone failing their driving test on the fifth try... but I‚Äôm scared because if I can‚Äôt drive myself, I‚Äôll have to quit my job. I love my job so much. 

I got a 61% this time, but I don‚Äôt know if she just gave me some points because I feel like we didn‚Äôt finish the test? Better than last time though. I need some encouragement. ",22Feb2019,1
100,"As the title says, I‚Äôve dropped a class and it really sucks because it honestly felt like a class that I could actually apply towards a career. I‚Äôve been struggling with school since fall of last year as I‚Äôve transitioned into a full time position while also experiencing severely horrible depression and other health issues. I‚Äôve tried to balance being both a full time employee and full time student and I ended up having to drop 2 classes last term, passing 1 class with a C, and failing the other class. This term I thought I‚Äôd be able to handle both again, but I was wrong. Again. I dropped the class, and now I‚Äôm left with 3 and I‚Äôm confident that I can pass those. I know that this feeling of failure is temporary and really it‚Äôs all in my head. But at the moment it just really hurts because I used to be a Dean‚Äôs List student every term up until last fall. And I feel directionless when it comes to the future, thinking ‚Äúhow am I going to move up now?‚Äù 

I make it seem as though my life is over because of this one class but to be honest it‚Äôs just part of a cluster of things going on in life and I wish the circumstances were better without stretching myself thin. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs also my depression and anxiety amplifying the severity of the situation as well, which also sucks. ",22Feb2019,4
