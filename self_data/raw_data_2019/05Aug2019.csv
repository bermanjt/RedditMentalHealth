0,"Two hours ago, I told the man I am in love with about my feelings. I got completely heartbroken, and I'm now in VC on Discord, venting to my friends and receiving advice from them. I've never been great at handling my feelings, and this pain was so intense, so sudden and - I believe - undeserved.

Now I'm feeling a lot of pain but also a lot of relief... I am so proud of myself! I was courageous and brave, and I told him how I feel even though I was expecting to get rejected. I simply wanted to quit playing this game.

Being with my friends right now really helps me, I'm so happy I have them, and that I can open up to them. They always give me good advice on how to behave and how to treat my feelings without freezing them - which is my favorite thing to do even unintentionally.

So the pain is terrible but I am really proud of myself, and after talking to my friends I'm calmer about the future.

I simply wanted to share it because I'm feeling weirdly happy despite feeling heartbroken and disappointed, as I know it was a very courageous thing to do. It is way less scary after it's done. And of course, I quit the friendship for my own good.",05Aug2019,8
1,"I bettered myself over this past year and I broke many of the toxic habits that I had developed with my depression. I thought she would be happy for me since she’s been by my side as my number one since 6th grade. The last time we hung out she didn’t sing along in the car like we used to. She hasn’t read any of my recent texts, but I hope she knows that I still care about her.",05Aug2019,3
3,"Throughout my pre-teen years, my family life was incredibly unstable. For context, I have an older brother (5 and a half years older) who suffers with a tremendous amount of mental illness.  He essentially bottled it all up as a child (I don't think he was even aware of the fact that he was sick). 

But when he reached high school, all of the hormones and drama that come with that, on top of his sickness, became too much for him. He responded the only way he knew how... Which was to develop a crippling addiction to marijuana and start routinely having destructive breakdowns, screaming at my parents about how much he wanted to die, how much he wanted to kill them as revenge for giving birth to him, about how much he wanted to kill his ex-girlfriend (who he had just discovered was cheating on him), referring to my mom as ""thing"" and begging my dad to divorce/kill her, telling my dad he's a failure of a father and doesn't deserve to live, and the like. I specifically remember times when the house would be calm, and then he would just randomly start screaming and growling like an animal. Physically, he would throw furniture around the house, threaten and chase my mother, give my dad black eyes, punch holes in the wall, or harm himself. 

To make things clearer, I was usually hiding in my room or somewhere else in the house during these outbursts, but walls and staircases couldn't defend you from that sort of chaos. I specifically remember one night when I was literally just trying to relax and have a snack with my twin brother, when my older brother burst in to the kitchen, shouted ""I can't take this anymore"", and stabbed himself in the chest.

Other specific things I remember are, as follows; leaving my room in the middle of the night for a glass of water and seeing at least 10 police officers by the front door (later to find out that my brother was taken to the hospital); breaking down and shouting at him that I couldn't handle the stress of being related to him, to which he responded by calling me a ""fat little faggot"" and telling me he would ""beat me til I was dead""; my parents kicking him out of the house, to which he responded by screaming through the windows and telling my parents that they deserved to die; not being able to get a ride to my friends' houses because my parents were afraid to leave him alone, in case he killed himself in the 5 minutes they were gone; my father dragging me and my twin in front of him and asking us to give him a reason to not kill himself; and countless times that he had such breakdowns while I had friends around the house, which left me with many awkward explanations of why my own brother started repeatedly screaming ""fuck"" for no good reason. Just to reiterate, this was all happening between the ages of 9 or 10 to about 12 for me. I was reduced to nightly prayers, begging God to either fix him or kill him; in fact, it was this experience that led to me doubting religion, cause what kind of God would let my family fall to complete shit when we hadn't even done anything to deserve it?

There were many more instances of shitty stuff that happened, but I'm already doing what I always do, which is just melodramatically running over the exact same old scars as if I haven't already re-lived them a million times. My parents did their best to protect me but they're only human and I don't blame them for how much I was exposed to. To conclude my older brother's story, he has since gone to rehab, completely turned his life around, and while he is by no means perfect, he now takes medication and has been on an upward trend for the last several years. Regrowing our relationship has taken a lot of time and awkwardness but it's slowly coming. I think that some resentment from what happened has definitely stunted it, though. He occasionally relapses and has a breakdown like he used to... which obviously stirs up old resentments and brings on an insurgence of sleepless nights spent mulling over the same bullshit.

The reason I'm saying all this is because I still am constantly running over the same painful experiences... like, if not daily, then once every 2 or 3 days. I have since discussed the experience with therapists and counselours who can all unanimously agree that it was an incredibly traumatic experience, and was certainly the catalyst for my own battle with mental illness. I've told the story a million times and telling it hardly provides a sense of catharsis anymore, and I still just keep on mentally retelling it, again and again, and reimagining what I would've said to him if I were older and braver, again and again, and bemoaning how much it traumatized and scarred me, again and again.

I feel stuck in a cycle and I want to know how to break out. If anyone has experience with childhood-age trauma and how to deal with it, it would be so very appreciated. Thanks!",05Aug2019,1
4,"I just feel such a heavy weight in my chest- I'm up at night until 5 and wake up at 9, just to lay in bed till noon, crying because I tell myself to get up and I don't move. I don't know how to go on in life. What to do next. I feel purposeless, and words of comfort seem empty, I don't know where to look for for practical solutions to apply to my life. I feel like I'm unable to have non-zero days, and I feel like I try so hard too, I don't know why I find myself back at it again at 11 pm realizing I've wasted the whole day.   
I gotta choose where to go to college. I don't know where. I want to help people for a living (I live in Italy) and I thought I could be a social worker to help people in their day to day lives (I looked at psychology but I don't want people to come to me- I want to be able to intervene in situations where the person wouldn't normally look for help, I know it's childish, but just like social workers in movies. That's all I know) but turns out there's a whole lot more bureaucracy and not working with people involved, organizing community events and transport for people with special needs and stuff. Not what I wanted to do. Apparently if I want to help others the way I want to I can't do it for a living. It has to be my side thing. And what do I do to make money then? I'm adhd and have problems focusing and here where I live they stop giving you meds after you turn 18. So I struggle a lot with studying something I at least *used* to love, so I'm so afraid and don't know what else I could do. Work a job that's not me just for the money?   
I really- am afraid and feel like I can't choose- I have this immense angst about fucking up my life forever, if I don't choose quick, if I don't choose the right thing, and..

I just want to break down and cry and I can't. I can't. I just feel this weight on my chest and this need to crawl into a ball until I fall asleep, which I won't, so I'll keep tormenting myself with my own thoughts. I would like to share my whole life story in this post, I'd like to feel understood, but I can't. There's no way to put some of these things in words, especially the bad things are hard to explain without context. That I can't/really don't have the strength to write down again.   
Writing this isn't even making me feel better at the moment. I needed to vent, I still need to vent, but I don't know to whom. I'd like to call out to my friends but they have their own lives, and I can't ask them to support me like I'd need to. My SO shouldn't think of me as a burden, so I do my best not to weigh on her with this feeling but she knows what I'm going through, and she can't help the situation.

I keep thinking that I don't want to live in this world. That I don't want to have to work in this system. I wish I could do my own thing, but the market for personalities and content creators is saturated. I could try and compete, and it would still take years, supposing I can even make it to fame in any sort of way. I just want to talk about these things I feel would help someone out there, even though I can hardly apply these thoughts to myself. Stuff like ""learn to forgive yourself"", ""forgive others"", ""offer comprehension"", but I hate me. I hate what I do I hate I have these thoughts I value so highly and I don't apply them. I feel like a hypocrite. Even worse, sometimes I feel like everything I believe about being able to do good in this world is wrong, and we've gone way too far to fix things now. And I don't want to live in a world where if I said we could be a better society, where we try to understand and comprehend and forgive each other people answer with ""we'll never live in world where all people are like that"" and when I say that it's still worth trying they say nah.   
I don't want to live in a world where people agree with my mentality of compassion, just to say that I shouldn't apply it to a world so corrupt, and even when I point out that the corrupt deserve compassion too, they tell me not to give empathy to what they say are ""evil"" people. I don't want to live in a world where we can't believe in the good of the human nature. 

  
And I'm struggling with myself because more and more I believe these words- I don't want to live in a world - and I think now I'm struggling to accept that I'm feeling kinda suicidal because I don't want people around me to feel like.. I don't know. I just.. I'm afraid to share. I'm afraid of them telling me to go to therapy. I'm afraid of looking for a therapist. I'm afraid a therapist would say exactly what everybody else has been telling me, and then what? If these things I believe in now aren't possible, are just a utopia, like my best friend called it, then what am I living for? For a crap life where I'm miserable and can't make a difference?

I can't just *forget* that people are suffering everyday because of something I feel is preventable. 

And I'm not sure. I'm afraid what to say next. I wish I were asleep.",05Aug2019,1

I have been absolutely paranoid as fuck that I'm going to get a dry socket even though I've been doing everything they said and I don't smoke. The stitches in my mouth are uncomfortable as all hell and I am constantly aware of them. The dentist told me that most people have pretty minimal pain, but GODDAMN my mouth has been hurting super fucking badly ever since I had it done. I am also pretty damn tired of being high on hydrocodone, but it's the only thing that makes me able to go about my regular life since it actually makes my mouth stop fucking hurting. I am almost out of the small amount they gave me, and I am not looking forward to the next few days without it. I don't want to ask them to refill it since I am pretty sure they will label me as a drug seeker. I had to go to work today and my job is fixing phones, so between the fog from the pain pills and the pain from my mouth, it was not very enjoyable nor very productive.

8,So about an hour ago it was 1am and I felt like having a late night glass of water so I went to the bathroom to fill my glass up and out of the corner of my eye I saw a fairly large spider; about 3cm in width crawling around my bathtub. It was going around the tub repeatedly looking like it couldn't get out and sure enough after watching it doing the same thing for 5 minutes I was definitely sure it wasn't going to make it out of there so I decided to grab a square of toilet paper to let it crawl on to and let it out the window. Now I'm an animal guy however I've never felt so wholesome before knowing I just helped this little thing get out from the slippery bathtub that was going to keep it captive forever!,05Aug2019,7
9,"These past few years have been rough personally. I joined an Engineering school 4 years ago and suffered paranoid personally disorder (my mom has diagnosed Bipolar Disorder) battling thoughts of dropping out, and shutting myself in isolation from my friends and family, fearing I was failing life. With this, I picked up self destructive behaviors like unhealthy obsession/ mix of pornography, alcohol, and wasting money on events and unnecessary materials. This caused me to be careless with my money.

I regret all of that and started changing my life for the better. I started getting into better habits such as finally learning photography, taking 15min walks outside, and quieting my racing thoughts with mediation.

However, unfortunately, receny my family was involved in a car accident. They hit head on with a truck that was filled with teenagers under the influence of weed and alcohol. The teens left unharmed, and my family suffered minor injury, but my mom suffered a hip injury along with bruised bones. 
Thankfully, she is okay for the most part, however she had to be taken to the hospital via ambulance because she could not get up in her own.

Please, I need help paying this hospital bill. Really any amount can make a big difference. 
Thank you so much and I hope everything will go well in the recovery process for my mom.

Soo... we've seen that this girl S likes to play with other's hope and glory. 

After our final high school exams we wrote a bit and we organize a day at a festival near her house, ok remember it!

Meanwhile, I have been doing a campus in which I knew this girl, that I will name M, that seemed interested to me (always hugging me and looking for me) so I started writing her, but obviously I didn't had any ""warranty"" about her. 

Right after the end of the campus, there was the festival day, so I met S. We enjoyed the concert together as two old friends do. After the concert I was trying to find someone who can stay there for a bit long because I wanted to see a famous dj on stage. Sadly nobody decided to stay there, 

BUT (Ah shit, here we go again) S asked me to go to her house to listen that famous dj (she lives very near the festival place) so I decided to take her home and I went up to her house. 

We drunk something together, then I told her about the girl that I wanted to date. She started to ""alert"" me about the low success expectancy with some girls in some situation (like knowing each other in a campus context). I thought about it but I (sadly (Yeah, sadly, you'll discover the meaning of this sadly right now)) didn't change my mind. 

After this friendly talk, we started listening to the music in the terrace, we started dancing a bit and getting very near to each other. The situation was going to a specific direction (you know dude). 

At that point I decided to not do anything with S (I know, you'll yell me for this) because I felt morally incorrect for M, and because if something could have go in the right way with M I would have morally marked myself bad for that. 

(I know, sometimes we just have to say FUCK to morality...)

So I missed my occasion with S, I could have done everything with her. But you know, if we arrived to that situation I thought, why don't recreate a situation like that?

    Everyone is aware of the gun control epidemic. It seems as if there are deadly shootings almost every week. There have been 61 shootings in the United States since January 16, 2019. Many people run to gun control to solve the problem. Some people think gun control should be more strict, other people go straight to banning guns like AR’s. Looking at a mass shooting, we can see why this might make sense. If these guns weren't available, these things wouldn't happen. That is simple logic. However, if we think more in-depth, we can see that these shooters will be able to get these guns in other ways. They will find a way.


A common argument people make when lobbying to ban guns is that the second amendment was only for muskets. That at the time the 2nd amendment was written, the founding fathers were only referring to muskets and muskets were the only guns available, not semi or fully automatic weapons. This is false. At the time of the second amendment, there were guns such as the Belton Repeating Flintlock(1777), Kalthoff Repeating Flintlock(1650’s), Nock Volley Gun(1782), and the 16 shot wheel lock(1590) among others(Brown). These were all guns invented pre-second amendment. 
    

There are some significant and important differences between fully automatic and semi-automatic that need to be addressed. Fully automatic means that when someone pulls the trigger, the gun will keep firing until pressure is let off the trigger or the magazine is empty. Semi-automatic is when only one bullet is fired per trigger pull (Songer). Many people, when talking about assault rifles and AR’s, often mix things up. AR does not stand for assault rifle, it stands for Armalite rifle. A standard AR is semi-automatic. Many people also say that its ok to ban them because it's not like they are used for hunting or self-defense. This is wrong. The Time Magazine actually had an article about AR hunters, and they make great self-defense weapons. There are three stories that reinforce this fact. An Oklahoma homeowner’s son used an AR-15 for self-defense, killing three home intruders. Another one is when Stephen Willeford grabbed his AR-15 and ran toward the Sutherland Springs church shooter. Upon arriving he shot the shooter, forcing him to flee the scene. The last one is when Dave Thomas witnessed his neighbor under knife attack, retrieved his AR-15 and ended the assault. 
    

Banning guns like ARs may seem practical at first, but a closer look would reveal that it wouldn't do much. There are easier and more practical ways to reduce mass shootings. Many arguments people make while lobbying for this are invalid such as at the time the second amendment was written only muskets existed, and ARs and similar guns are impractical. Banning ARs and similar guns will not do anything in reducing mass shootings. 
    

First, let's look at all these supposed facts that anti-gun people throw out. Many people say that when the second amendment was ratified, only muskets were around, or that the founding fathers had only muskets in mind, or it was for the sole purpose that the civilians have something to defend themselves. This is all wrong. As stated before, there were plenty of guns around that had larger capacity magazines and a faster firing rate during and even before the second amendment was written. Take the 16 shot wheel lock, for example, invented in the 1590s and could fire 16 stacked charges of powder and ball in a rapid “Roman candle” fashion (Brown). Or the Belton repeating Flintlock that could fire around 20 rounds with one trigger pull in about five seconds (Crowder). Then there was the Kalthoff repeating flintlock that could fire up to 30 rounds in some models, which was the same amount as the AR15. So, in reality, high capacity firearms are not a modern concept (Brown). 
    

Even if we do ban guns, the mass shooters will still find a way. They will buy the guns off the black market, or just use different guns. They are not going to see that stricter gun control laws were passed or that semi and fully automatic guns were outlawed and go “oh shucks looks like they got me.” They will find other ways. Another thing that will do nothing is increasing the amount of “gun-free zones”. Almost 98% of mass shootings already occur in these areas (Pratt).       


As for the people who are radical enough to say that people should ban all guns should rethink things. Having citizens who legally carry guns will help more than banning assault weapons. If someone starts to shoot people at a public event, someone could just pull out a Smith and Wesson M&amp;P Series handgun and stop it then and there. Two potential mass shootings were prevented in the month of November 2018 by law-abiding citizens using a concealed firearm (Pratt). One such event was when a masked man opened fire on a McDonalds and was immediately shot and killed by a father leaving the restaurant with his children (WBRC Staff). Kyle Kushav, a student at Stoneman Douglass High School when the shooting occurred, also thinks people should have the right to defend themselves and carry guns. Everyone has the fundamental right to defend themselves. This argument about guns killing people so we should ban them is ridiculous. Vehicles kill just as many, possibly even more people than guns. Maybe its time to ban those, and make everyone use bicycles. 
    

Many people today want to focus on the gun, not the people committing the crime. They believe that the gun is the main problem, not the person wielding it. This is wrong. About 60% of mass shooters have a history of serious mental disorders and two-thirds had never been seen by a professional, said Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, who has spent years studying mass public shootings(Waters).
There are many people out there who own a semi or even fully automatic gun that aren't committing this terrible crime. They are regular people, just like you and me. It is not the gun, its the person.
    
 
Leah Libresco is a statistician and former writer for FiveThirtyEight. She was a former advocate for gun control and the banning of semi and fully automatic firearms. However, when doing research on gun deaths with her team, she found that even with strictly tightened gun laws in Britain and Australia, neither country had drops in gun-related deaths. She also studied all 33,000 lived ended by guns in the United States each year and found evidence that interventions could have saved lives. 
    

Banning ARs and similar guns will not do anything in reducing mass shootings. The gun is part of the problem, but not the root of it. If a leaf is taken from a tree, it will just grow back. If it is torn up by the roots, it will die. The gun is just a leaf on the tree of gun violence. People need to find the root of the problem to fix it. It's not the gun that's the problem, its the person. There are many people who are functioning members of society who own semi and fully automatic firearms. There are many other ways to reduce mass shootings.

15,"My life is what one might call a disaster movie. It is full of happiness, regrets, and despair.   
Ever since I was younger, my family has been a disaster of manic yelling and hate. My father is a cheater; My mother is a cheater, they both seek to find other people. However, they provide the necessities for my sister and me, for which I am grateful. Sometimes though I sit and think, ""is it true that great to be rich, to have everything you need physically? sometimes I really just want parents or someone to talk to.""   
I sit in my room most of my days listening to music and doing school work, occasionally, I hear my parents upstairs screaming at each other and grandma being a gas can dumping more fuel into the argument. I always rush upstairs to make sure no one gets too hot-headed, but after each incident, I become colder and colder. I watch my mother cry, I watch my father fuming. Neither of my parents accept they are all at fault. I sit there myself telling the family ""no one is right, including me.""  
I have dated 3 girls in my life time, of which non of our relationships have ended due to not loving each other, but because somehow some fucking how. I always pick the girls that have parents that are enemies of my parents. I always get shamed before they even meet me. I always get slandered, but I dont say anything because I truly love them. We always try our best to love each other but in the end it is still the end.  
I believe my parents want best for my sister and me, but as I grow older and understand more, I really want to shelter my sister from the emotional distress. Sometimes, I do believe in god, but not as a person to praise for or put faith into, but someone that has drawn the cards to my life.   
Pt2.   
I met a girl at work one day; I was there interning. She seemed like a bright soul and a happy being, but something in her eyes resembled mine. We shared the misery of never having something substantial there for us. In a short three month period, we became best friends, and we both started to develop feelings for each other. We began hitting things off, and one day, we were out for lunch, and she was taking a few photos and showing me her ex's because we did become best friends. And of her three boyfriends was my Father.   
At that moment, I lost my fucking mind. I was about to drive into a lake. I left crying, and there was an abyss in my heart. I have tried so hard to act like nothing is wrong but at that moment. I world felt like it was going to crash down on me. I told her that was my father. She started to cry. She said, "" I didn't know, we dated for a few months, but I knew he had a family. And I knew I didn't want to do anything to break it up. "" I drove off, I didn't know of lefts and right anymore.",05Aug2019,1
16,"A long time ago, more than a year before he was dating again, before those engagement pictures showed up in the group chat, I told a mutual friend that I had a crush on him.  For now, let's call her Emily.

&amp;#x200B;

Emily thought it was hilarious and adorable.  She told me that it was natural and okay - that he was handsome, and talented, and whatnot.  It was a sign that I had a good head on my shoulders, and that one day I would meet someone good.

&amp;#x200B;

It was the most loving way she could tell me I didn't have a chance.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, some friends and I got together for dinner.   There's another friend - let's call her Jill.  Jill is one of those people who doesn't like to embarrass people by telling them things upfront; she's the kind of person who will get everyone together to remind them of something that she (and sometimes, everyone) knows that only one person forgot.   So when she casually mentioned mid-conversation that it is a bad idea for anyone to tell Emily any secrets, because she can't keep them - while sitting beside me - I had to quietly resolve that my crush probably wasn't a secret between two people anymore.  It doesn't help that Jill and Emily are close, and in fact coworkers.

&amp;#x200B;

A year later, Jill was also the person who personally told me that the guy I liked was starting to date someone we both knew.  It didn't make sense in the slightest for that topic to come up during our lunch date - he wasn't relevant to what we were talking about.  It was an embarrassing moment, because it showed proof positive that she knew, but wasn't going to put me on the spot.  She mentioned it gently, and seemed to expecting a certain response;  I only smiled and told her that it was good news. 

&amp;#x200B;

And that was that.

&amp;#x200B;

But I still liked him.  I tried to reason it away.  I tried to pretend it away.  I tried to smile it away when friends got excited about the eventual, inevitable engagement.  It didn't help that friends in our little squad liked to make comments about how similar we were -it was a running gag that we were the same person, but split between genders.   It happened so often that a poor, confused girl once assumed that *we* were dating.   Of course, all of those comments stopped a few months into their relationship.   It was, after all, getting super weird.  

&amp;#x200B;

And all the while, I couldn't mention it to anyone, because every important person in my life was absolutely excited about how this beautiful, God-ordained romance was budding.  And those who did knew lovingly regarded me like a kid with a fleeting puppy crush.  

&amp;#x200B;

I knew they only said it out of love, but it made me so angry.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't want someone to tell me that there was some insane way for me to win his heart.  I didn't want someone to lie and suggest that maybe he once liked me back.  I just wanted the few people who knew what I was feeling to treat me like an **adult**.  I didn't want them to speak down to me and tell me that my feelings were just *natural*, or to be not-so-subtly ignored when he came up in conversation.   I wanted a friend to lean on because it hurt.   When I finally landed in the therapists office and spilled everything, my therapist skeptically asked me if I was somehow convinced that he liked me back.  When I answered no, she only leaned back in the chair and said *Thank you.* That therapist wound up suggesting that maybe I didn't *really* like him - maybe I just really wanted what the two of them had, and I admired them.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't delusional - I was not persuaded that maybe, deep down, he liked me back, although a selfish part of me would have loved that.  I knew he wasn't mine, no matter how much I wanted him to be.  I just wanted to be taken seriously, so that I could move on.  

&amp;#x200B;

They're married now.   His wife is so lovely - there is nothing about her that isn't admirable.  Beneath everything else, I am   becoming genuinely glad that they are together, and I know that our friends are even happier. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I just wish I hadn't had to spend two years of my life pretending that it wasn't eating me alive.   I know that in reality, I am probably the delusional, insane, selfish bad guy whose throwing a pity party for herself, but I just needed go get this out.",05Aug2019,12
17,"According to the “extrovert and introvert” stuff, an extrovert becomes drained when alone and energised with people and an introvert becomes drained with people and energised alone.

I don’t have any friends except three from high school who I only catch up with once a year. I can’t talk to people at all and I’ve tried to make friends but I overthink everything and stay quiet even though I want to talk to someone so much.

I started off at 14.50 and have gotten a 50 cent raise over there year and I will be getting an extra 25 soon making 14.75. The only thing is I have hated this job for a while now making me cry at times and giving me severe anxiety. It was really bad about a month ago but has recently simmered down. Now my friend has offered me to hook me up with a job at her work which is a restaurant. There pay however is 12 dollars but with tips. She is a server and can make up to 300 a night. I obviously would start off as a hostess not making many tips, maybe &lt;20 a night. I’m worried about the paycut Bc I am a spender and like to money saved, im scared that I will not like the new job and then end up regretting quitting my current one. I can’t keep both Bc I start school soon. (I am 19 years old) I fortunately don’t NEED a job because my parents have the funds to pay for things but that is THE LAST thing I would want. I currently pay for all my things and don’t depend on them. Idk what to do any advice? I talked to my dad about it and he said to just do it and take a risk. If you don’t like it, you find another job that’s it. I LOVE my coworkers at my current job I just don’t like the job in itself and i wasn’t happy for a long time, but now it seems that once an opportunity is arising, I can’t seem to leave the place.

57,"we are on a summer camp rn and my friend fucked up her knee like real bad (and it’s very bad timing aswell because she had a lot planned and very important buisness to get up to once we got back). i felt horrible yesterday when it happenned and all day today and couldn’t stand to hear about it because i would shiver just thinking about her pain and the opportunities she’ll have to put to the side. idk i just felt like throwing up the whole time. some will say it’s empathy but it feels like i’m self preserving more than anything and i feel so bad about it. and feeling bad about it makes me feel even worse, and so forth and so on. 

i offered to bring her suitcase back with me. it costs money and space and is stressful so i’m kind of seen as this altruistic legend but truth is, now i feel a bit better because i did something nice for her. but the fact that i stopped feeling as bad about the accidebt itself makes me feel even more selfish. i really am a monster who only focuses on myself and my impressions and i feel so bad about it. what can i do to stop being a horrible person? it feels like whatever i do, i’m still a piece of shit.

61,"In this universe I would never of thought that I would of had a best friend , soul mate , or fiancé   All rolled in to one . 10 years of my life of great adventures funny moments great memories but all that had to come to an end I lost my best friend of 10 years. She was the most important person in my life. My soulmate. She's don’t want contact with me and I don't blame her. I was so motivated at the start of this year to be a better person but without her by my side, I don't want to be anything. All the color has drained from the world. I can't eat. I can't sleep. And it's not her fault I feel this way. 

It's the realization that I'm such a terrible person that the best friend I've ever known, who's been there through thick and thin, who just the night before she stopped talking to me was telling me how everything was going to be okay, could completely cut me off. I hurt her so bad that all the promises of our future together are no more. And I cannot forgive myself for that I blame my self for pushing her away like I have and she’s has to  find trust in another man or talk to another man when we where engaged   Choosing what I’m going to do is a hard process but I can’t carry on living knowing that some other guy has stolen her heart and my life 

With all the struggle of losing my  souls mate my dad passes away.  And then to follow with bad news that my mum is critically ill and hasn’t got long left to live either this is why I’m giving my life a break.  And I’m a ticking time bomb I can’t carry on no more.

63,"I broke up with my bf via text like 4 months ago. It was complicated, on-off, I dated someone else, but eventually we got back together. 

One time during the break up, we tried to have sex for the first time. We both haven’t done it ever. Right before it, while we were naked n kissing already, I asked him how this shit even goes, and he laughs and says “how should i know?” The sex didn’t push through for other reasons and we tried again in the coming days. In one of these days, he admits to already having had sex multiple times when we were broken up. He admitted this to me because I admitted something else to him and he thought because I did it, we were even. I wasn’t mad about that, because we were broken up, but I was furious about the fact that he lied and pretended while I was in a vulnerable position. He made me feel stupid and used. I felt so betrayed. 

Eventually, I forgave him and we were back together. Though a few days after, I went out with my friends and danced on the same guy I dated in the last 4 months.  I danced / twerked on him but immediately stopped. I lied about it at first, saying that I didn’t mean to. 2 months later, I couldn’t stand the guilt anymore and came clean. He broke up with me and now says that he’s done. For good. 

Now, I can’t help but think how unfair it is that he can’t forgive me for what I did when I forgave him for what he did. I know that not everyone’s hearts are the same or pain is different for everyone, but I think it’s just really unfair that he doesn’t love me enough to look past it like I did.

67,"So my ex and I have been apart for almost a year now and for the 5 years we were together she had a couple of serious physical and mental health problems she was working through. That entire time I was there supporting her through it all when she had very few friends and basically no family she could rely on. We didn't ever really know what was going on but regardless, we worked together to manage it and ended up really supporting each other well.

Fast forward to an hour ago and i read a long post on her facebook explaining the issues shes had and tough times she went through to get a specific diagnosis for an illness she didnt know she had. This explained everything she had been through and it was missed quite a few times but shes in a much better place now and I'm genuinely happy to know that. In that post at the end, she goes on to thank all her friends and family for supporting her and completely neglected to mention me at all in her post

Now I'm not one to need validation from others but we were both going through really hard times over the duration of our relationship and while we ended on good terms, it really stung quite a lot to feel as though I didnt even exist during that time of her life. I know where not together anymore but that doesnt detract from the fact that the support I gave which apparently meant nothing to her based on the post she made.

It can lead and has lead to atrocious outcomes to others and much more crucially to myself whenever it'd feel endangered or threatened.

On the flip side, it's been there to offer me strength, consolation and perhaps even distraction when no one else could. Even in all those social encounters where I have acted antisocially somehow and drifted further into undesired isolation, it's ALWAYS me being first triggered by certain flaws demonstrated by the other party, such as arrogance, ill-intent and narrow-mindedness; so my ego is a self-righteous one.

79,"I (16M) have a friend (16M) who used to be a really fun person to be around and was really supportive. But as of a little while ago, he has started to become different than who he was. He became angrier and demanded more things from me and the other people in the friend group, often telling us we don’t include him enough when all of us make an effort to include him more. A few weeks ago, him and two other friends from the group went to six flags and the went in the wave pool. This friend cannot swim, so for the most part the three of them stayed in the part of the pool where they could stand. The other two friends asked if they could go in the deep end for a little bit to swim, and he agreed. They were making sure to check on him while they were out in the wave pool and after they came back in, they found him really pissed off because he had been pushed into the parts where he couldn’t stand by another park goer on accident and had to get pulled out by some random person. After this, he started saying hurtful things to them and talked about them behind their backs, telling misinforming information like “They left me to drown” when in actuality it was an accident. My brother was there to defend him because he saw that this person was in a bad state of mind and wanted him to feel better, despite him constantly being in the wrong. After a few days of this friend being deceptive and saying hurtful things and changing his story to different people about who he trusted, it all got swept under the rug. Flash forward to a few days ago. I got off work at around 10:00 and got a call from my parents telling me to go to the hospital. My brother had to be hospitalized because he was having heavy suicidal thoughts and was hurting himself. I was so wrecked, and a few of my friends were as well. I was so close to losing my life long friend, and it hurt me so much. This friend didn’t show much care but at one point stated that he didn’t care about my brother being in the hospital at all. Me and a few other friends got mad at him for it but tried peacefully resolving it, and he turned all the conversations hostile trying to defend himself and said some very hurtful things about us. This was the last straw for me, he never feels satisfied for what we do for him, he says hurtful words to us, and he has no care for the person who defended him at his lowest point simply for him being there.

Hi, so pretty much after puberty i got a lil curvy which i wasn’t fond of. by year nine i had some pretty self destructive habits and it was getting to a pretty bad stage (max half of one meal a day, fainting occasionally, 10 +water bottles worth of water a day) when one of my close friends actually ended herself in hospital with a tube down her throat and it freaked me out to a major degree. After that i properly panicked and forced myself into two full meals a day and all was tolerable besides my terrible mindset causing a bit of depression in later years. I was a latchkey kid and so no one other than my older brother really noticed and after my friend i started eating again so all was fine and whilst i didn’t get any help, i sorted myself out physically so i could be fine. 

once i bounced back i got curvy again and when i finished school i stopped sports and got curvy and a bit more. ive tried a few times to start losing weight again but notice myself falling into unhealthy habits and stopped cold turkey each time in fear. i really want to lose weight because it really affects my self esteem and i find myself not doing things i want to because of it but also I’m frightened of starting again in case i fall down the same tunnel. Even now i love when i haven’t eaten and i feel my tummy rumble and after big meals i always thing about how easy it would be to just throw up and how it would solve all my problems. 

I know working out will help of course, but I’m worried if i start it’ll start up my obsessive thinking. I find it really hard to pull myself out of patterns and honestly even getting rid of my scales was an insanely hard task. I work out twice a week already and walk everywhere so i walk at least 1-2 hours a day.

Im a 22 years male in a conservative country. i havent had a girlfriend . i have never ask anybody .

I used to think this is mostly about my fear of rejection and lack of self confidance because i'm a short guy(165 5'2).              
 I never got bullied about being short . but i'm really insecaure about it.

At my teens(13-18) while my friends always talked about girls and i was never really into it but being gay didnt even cross my mind at that time so i always thought i'm straight but just a loser who cant get a girlfriend.

After a while i found my self looking into guys in porn . First i thought it's a nothing important and it's  just a thing that will go away after a while but i didnt. I started checking out guys irl and searching especailly for hot man while waching porn. 

After that i finally realised that i might be gay but there is one thing that boggles me about it. If i suck at one thing or realised that if  i'm not good at something i just quit it and always use most comfortable way.

 Then i reailsed i might not be gay and my mind choose to be gay rather than the be a straight  loser because in my teens   
 i never tought of being gay. I havent meet anyone gay to ask but i think they always know that they are gay.

I'm caught in the middle and cant decide wheter i'm gay or my mind just playing games. It's really hard for me to figure out and i'm starting to think about it all the time and i cant talk about it with anyone so creating this post may help me

I know I wasn't able to post these past 2 days and it's all because I had nothing to post. Nothing much happened just like previous days when I did post. I figured I should change the way I label my journal writings since I'll be expecting days where I'm completely out of ideas. With regards to my daily habits, I have successfully reached day 6 on nofap which leaves me 84 more days to abstain from PMO. I felt the urge reach its peak yesterday, but when I woke up this morning it was gone. Although my sexual thoughts have still remained, my urge to commit PMO has disappeared. The Nofap community calls this a ""flatline"" wherein you stop caring about sex, therefore finding difficulty in gaining an erection. I like having flatlines because they help you avoid relapsing, but it just goes to show that I do have a porn addiction and my brain has been seriously damaged because of it. My longest streak is 21 days and my goal is 90. If ever I do reach 90 days, I will quit porn for good. Today is day 6 and I haven't been in this long of a streak in years. I'm taking nofap seriously now because I want the cycle to end. I don't want to be incredibly lazy anymore. I don't want to be socially anxioud and depressed anymore.

89,"I'm going to start with this, this is going to be a long post just about life and everything. It encompasses my previous posts I've had on my account as well as just general venting and getting it out.

I grew up in a sort of catholic house, my parents weren't big on church, but we would go for the major events. I think it was to appease my moms parents, or just to have a presence in a sort of catholic community we live in. I am 28, turning 29 this year, so I was born in 1990. 

I had an obsession with nature when I was younger, toads mostly. I wasn't popular in grade school, I had a few friends and I was more on the stage of I was known, people would talk to me, but I didn't actively hangout with the popular kids. I had some really good friends in first grade, and going into second I had a birthday party and everyone from my grade showed up. 

When I went into 2nd grade I had to get glasses, and well that decreased any interest anyone had in talking to me. My friends were still my friends but I wasn't really cared for at that point. In grade 3 my best friend moved about 25 minutes away, but no longer was attending my school and that distance at 8 is the destroyer of friendships. We tried to for the next few years but eventually fell off on communication. I mean the internet was hardly a thing then.

I was a C student and diagnosed with ADD I was put on some medication. When I graduated grade 6 my teach said I was a smart student and didn't need the meds, I had graduated with almost straight A's. Turns out she was wrong, I struggled in grade 7 and grade 8. At this time my friends were only a few people I'd talk with at school, but never outside. I had a few friends from my block that I would hangout with but high school kind of made us all go our own separate ways.

Something that I realize now between all these years was I spent every night praying, wishing, and hoping I was a girl. Just wake up and the only thing that would be different was my gender. I didn't know anything about transgender, not for several years. Gay was an insult to me, lesbian was well what anyone that was interested in girls was, and everything else wasn't a thing. I didn't think praying for this was normal, my prayers always went unanswered and I started questioning my faith during this time.

I always liked feminine things but my interest in nature and toads seemed to always counteract it I guess. I never stopped hoping I'd change though. I lost my faith though and became an apathiest and had no interest or care for any higher power now. I stopped praying but still kept my wishes open.

Around when Maple Story 2 came out, that's when I had the thought that I could play as a female character. This actually helped me feel a bit better, I didn't pine over not being a girl as much because I was able to be one in the game. Feminine pronouns, feminine appearance, just things it made things easier. 

Most of my friends went to a different high school and really I only had acquaintances at my new one, but my choice was a catholic high school or a public high school... well I lost faith and I didn't want that crammed down my throat anymore so I went with the public one.

I made a total of one friend throughout highschool, I struggled so much, I tried getting back on ADD meds but the doctor prescribed a weaker version of what I had previously and they made no difference. A lot of the people I had been friends with were now barely anything to me. The few friends I've kept, about near the end of high school, I lost one of them. He started dating a girl I had been hanging around with and had interest in, he knew, added her on msn, and talked to her eventually asking her out. I told him to fuck off eventually and cut him and her out of my life.

So really at this point I had two friends and I was going into college. They were both living close to me, one I spent most of my time with and the other I hung around a decent amount but we were different in a way.

As time went on though, my online presence became a huge thing, both representations of myself. The current male self I was and my feminine desired self. I met a girl in high school through a website that became a long distance relationship, we had it going well for 3 years until her best friend messaged me saying she was cheating on me. 

So my current presence online receded and my feminine desired personality became more prevalent. I spent time in games, StarCraft, Diablo II, IMVU... I even switched to having one for PS3 when that came out. I would always play a female character, I would always setup this entire persona that was different than me in other ways. I wanted to be someone else because I hated being me.

I pushed away the few friends I had, the few friends I could have had in college, I pushed them all away because I was ashamed of my secret, I spent money on both lives of myself, dual purchased games, tried to live a separate life, lied about who I was, made up several names and tried to act out each of these personas. I kept trying to find a way to just get this feeling to go away.

Obviously by this time I had learned about transvestites, but I wasn't a cross dresser, I wanted to be a woman. I wanted this feeling to get out. I wanted to just be able to be happy and make friends because I was fucking lonely and I didn't like who I was.

In college one of my childhood friends, one of the few, managed to screw me over financially. He had purchased a new power supply for his computer and gave me his old one and said to pay him for it when I had the money. Well two days before payday he demanded the money, I didn't have much money in my account and my car insurance was going to come out of it and the amount he wanted for that powersupply wouldn't be enough for my car insurance and it. He demanded so I went and took the money out of my account, it went into overdraft fees. I called him a ""Fucking little bitch"" and that was the last time we've ever spoke.

I was a bit relieved because my other friend barely asked to hangout, I could make an excuse in college to not go anywhere with anyone. I could live my online persona without anyone interfering with me. I did this to myself in a way.

I almost flunked out of my college program, technically I did, I had to do a few extra semesters to just get a passing GPA. During one of these semesters I took a human sexuality class, it had a chapter on transgendered individuals. This was 6-7 years ago.

I have not made any friends since then, I still only have the one single friend that has since moved over a hundred kilometers away. I see him even less now. I am lonely, I made online friends, I still try to mitigate the dysphoria, but it's not doing anything anymore.

I only started HRT last year on September 24th, I'm 28 now and I started it so late. I know other people start it late as well but I was afraid of anyone finding out. I still am.

I first started seeing a therapist in 2016, I could barely afford her and she recommended me switching my family doctor to a new one because they have major support for the LGBT community. I was with a nurse practitioner, my entire family was. I couldn't tell them I was dysphoric or my family would have found out, HIPPA be damned. It took me a year but finally my family was switching to a new doctor, I switched to the one the therapist recommended me and they had a free therapist. I made several appointments with my doctor for bogus things just working up the courage to tell him that I was trans.

It took another month or so to see the therapist, the therapist set me up with an endocrinologist, and I think it took almost a full year before I was able to start HRT. 

I feel like I haven't lived any part of my life yet. I set myself to have no friends, I don't trust my family, I don't want to tell my one friend but I get scared every time. I just want to be me and have friends and have just life. I just want to be happy but so far I think the past 16 years of my life, since I was in high school, I have missed out on everything. 

I have never been in a physical relationship, I haven't ever been invited to a party where it wasn't essentially mandatory I went. I avoided drinking and drugs because I didn't want to lose my self preservation and reveal my secret.

I just feel like I lost so much of my life, I don't know how to make or keep friends, I don't want to give up my persona, I don't want to just risk everything I have. If I tell anyone it will get out, people will find out, they always do. I don't know how supportive the people that are my family are, hearing their transphobic and homophobic remarks at family get-togethers makes me think they aren't so much. 

I want to just get out of this place, start fresh, start as me, meet people, make friends, find a girl, have a life. I just don't know how. I can't find a job somewhere else, I can't afford to live on my own because of stupid financial decisions. I can't just move somewhere else. I am just in this cycle of self-loathing, no friends, no support, and every day I feel worse and worse about myself. I'm majorly depressed, I have other problems as well. 

I just want to break this cycle.",05Aug2019,1

91,"I don’t really expect anyone to upvote or reply to this post, but I just needed to get this out somewhere so I’m going to do it here.

For a long time I always wished I was extroverted, I saw all my friends thriving at parties and being excellent at small talk, they were always so outgoing and seemed to always be up for social gatherings like parties, this was never the case for me and I always thought life would be so much easier if I were an extrovert. Recently though, I’ve realized that being an introvert has just as many benefits as being an extrovert, and I couldn’t imagine going through life with a quiet mind, as my mind is always going, It’s constantly filled, and I couldn’t imagine life with this being any different than it is. Another thing I love about being an introvert is that I take a while to open up to people, I use to think this was a bad thing and associate it with the reason why I was never able to be close with anyone, but that isn’t true, I’ve realized that I’m not very close with anyone simply because I haven’t found the right person to be close with yet, and being reluctant to open up is actually really awesome, as it can constantly keep relationships of any manner interesting given that there will always be something new I can share with this person. Another thing I do as an introvert is overthink the smallest things, which again, I thought was a bad trait, but in reality it’s not all that bad, yeah it still makes me self conscious over things that really don’t matter, but it also invokes my creativity and imagination, the smallest thoughts in my mind can grow way out of proportion and sometimes that’s a good thing. In being an introvert, I am naturally quiet and avoid conflict, not because it scares me, but because it’s hard for me to initiate any conflict, this creates a very positive stereotype around me that I am nice, and friendly even to people that I don’t like because I will avoid showing any sign of dislike towards people because it’s easier just to be quiet, and friendly with anyone I come into contact with on a daily basis. I also consider myself to be very loyal, which is often associated with introversion, loyalty comes easy to me as I don’t feel the need to be stimulated by anyone else, if I’m close to you, I won’t do anything to screw that up because that level of bonding doesn’t come easy to me, and most of the time it’s more than enough to keep me interested. Being an introvert has made me who I am and there is nothing I would do to change that, I observe myself and see that I am creative, loyal, friendly, interesting, observant, and good with giving advice, and those are all my best traits, and they all come from being an introvert, and that freaking rocks.",05Aug2019,913

101,"I live in a city near Brussels and yesterday I decided to go there with the train (it’s a 40 min travel) and to explore alone a little. I was there at 10 am, bought some chocolate for myself and to give as a present and started to walk around. So I was walking, I am with headphones and listening to a podcast and I see a man, with the corner of my eye, that started to talk to me. I stopped. Maybe I shouldn’t have. I could easily pass him and pretend that I didn’t see him but I stopped. He asked me if I speak french or and I said English. He started to talk and to repeat the same things over and over. Asked me about my name, why I am in the city ect. When I write this I can’t imagine why I would answer this questions but I did. First I thought he would ask me for money but eventually he showed me his wallet (with his meal voucher card) and I saw that he had money. He smelled like beer, I understood that he didn’t slept, most probably he just left some club. He was well dressed but his clothes were dirty like he was in some dirty space of he fell. Eventually I spent 3 hours with that man. He bought me beer when I asked him for recommendations (I didn’t drank it), he showed me The pissing boy, bought me a waffle with chocolate (he asked me if I am hungry, I said no, but yeah...). That we went to see The pissing girl and some statue of a saint that you have to wish something and to stroke his hand. I even went to his home... I didn’t want to go upstairs but he insisted that nothing will happen between us “today”. He said “some day you will come, we will go dancing, some eating, some drinking, some smoking”. I was walking after him going upstairs and I was thinking to myself what am I doing, this isn’t safe, nobody knows where am I, that I even left my town.... Nothing happened in his apartment. I didn’t sit,I stood between him and the door. When we left, he left his backpack, he realised that he is being late for work, show me the direction to the train station, hugged me and left. 
This, sadly, is not the first time I put myself in this kind of situation simply because a man told me, or showed me, that he likes me or think that I am beautiful.
For a long time, nearly 20 years, I have a problem with my weight. I think I am fat, never satisfied how I look, always on a some kind of diet. I like my face and my hair but that’s it. I have low self-esteem, introvert. I do whatever it takes to avoid interactions with people. One time I nearly fainted because I couldn’t buy food because I imagined how I would have to talk to someone in a store and couldn’t bare it. 
I have a binge eating problem too. Actually thats why I was there. I had chocolate bought for my parents and friends, to give as a present but actually I secretly ate them and me going to Brussels was my secret mission to replenish the chocolates so nobody can find out. I have some trigger foods that I avoid that are chocolate, peanuts, bread. So in my mind I am not attractive and when something like this happens, when someone show me affection, I am like a butterfly, lured to the light. I understand that it’s completely unsafe. The man from Sunday resembled a guy I know and it was like I was with him, it was irrational thought, but that was my comfort, he wouldn’t do me any harm, he looks like X.

102,"my (56f) new partner (m57) of 2 months had a son who passed away at about 18 mos. old, 22 years ago.  When he first told me the story, he sobbed quite a bit.  He and his ex-wife had other adopted children, who his ex turned against him after the divorce.  So he's been estranged from them for about 8 years.  He does have an adult son from his first marriage who he is in contact with - though I haven't met him.
It seems he is in a lot of grief over all these losses which I completely understand and have compassion for.  What I'm having trouble with is how to respond each time he mentions something his young son had done.  For example, we were in bed getting ready to go to sleep and my cat jumps on the bed, lays down between us for a bit, gets up and stares at him for a while and then I say 'she thinking that you're in her spot' - it was just a light comment, nothing big.  Then he says how when he, his ex and his son would be in bed, the son would say 'daddy, you're in my spot' - cute, I guess, but I didn't know what to say....
He keeps interjecting all these things his young son used to do or say and I don't know how to respond.  I have no reference or connection to this child.  I don't know if I can help him grieve or if I'm supposed to.
This guy also has tried showing me old photos of his family who I haven't met either and it kind of makes me uncomfortable because, again, I have no real connection to these people.  I don't want our relationship to be about living in his past memories.  I want to be in a relationship that is about building a life for the future.  
Am I being cold-hearted? Any one have any experience with anything like this?",05Aug2019,1
103,"I am super average looking and all my life I was always not necessarily the ugly, but definitely the less attractive friend. Guys never paid any attention to me and I hated it. Obviously, there’s more important things in life than getting attention, but I don’t know, I just didn’t feel so good about it. Lately though, I notice that people look at me way more and I can instantly tell if a guy is interested. It’s something I’ll have to get used to. Still feels very weird, because I just know I’m not that pretty.

So basically what I changed about myself to achieve that are the following things:

1) I stopped trying to have a certain style of fashion. There are so many reasons to stop trying to be a fashionable person. I still love trends, but it’s just not maintainable at all. I always ended up with a super incoherent wardrobe. Now I buy pieces that are super basic and bring out my feminine features in a hopefully elegant way. I hardly ever think about what to wear because I just know everything fits me well and is easy to mix and match. So beautiful clothes are important, but fashion is not. 

2) I own only 4 make up things: eyeliner, blush, mascara, eyebrow pencil. I keep it super basic. I understand some people love to experiment and I know people who really pull it off, I just know that I don’t. I don’t want to look like I’m trying too hard to look pretty, because honestly no matter how much makeup I put on people will always be able to tell wether I’m actually pretty or not so there’s really no point. And even if they couldn’t, I don’t want to feel uncomfortable if someone sees me without makeup once. 

2) I stopped trying to fit my identity into a certain box. This kind of goes along with the fashion thing. It took me so long to even realise that I wasn’t quite being myself, I had no idea what being myself really felt or looked like. I feel like the only way to find out is to stop thinking about your identity altogether and just go with the flow and always try to do your best. You’ll know who you are soon enough. It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t reflect on it now and then, but being obsessive with it is harmful. 

3) I actually started enjoying other people instead of trying ‘psychological tricks’ to appear confident. Having genuine goodwill towards people makes conversations incredibly easy. This one took me a long time (years) to get right though, I used to hate other people, especially when I was depressed. But once I recovered, loosened up a bit and let go of my bitterness, I immediately got more positive reactions, which made it even easier to loosen up more. It’s an upwards spiral. I’m now at a point where I genuinely believe that most people are kind. If someone is an asshole I just assume they’re having a hard time at the moment. I was an asshole too when I wasn’t feeling well at all. Not that it justifies it. It just takes a lot of strength to not let it out on other people. 

So in conclusion, what I’ve learned from this experience is that people gravitate towards positivity just as much as to beauty, if not more.  It is so painfully obvious, but I always have to experience a life lesson myself to actually believe what people have been saying for ages. 
I mean, the extremely beautiful guys still don’t pay me attention haha, but they’re like 0.1% of the population and honestly it’s just nature.

For almost a year now I have not felt the slightest bit of sexual interest. I’ve kind of forced myself a few times and have not enjoyed it. Now, I’ve never been big on sex itself, but I used to love to masturbate. I did also have a pretty good sexual relationship with my boyfriend. He travels for work a lot, so it works out that it isn’t super often we get intimate. We have been together two and a half years now. I don’t think my lack of interest has anything to do with him. I still love him very much.  He’s my best friend and he still gives me butterflies. But I’ve been unable to get in the mood in 5 months. And before that, for about 4 months.

122,"Why is this? I realized throughout my whole life I look at my relationships as functional connections. Don't get me wrong, I'm not like a full-blown sociopath but maybe something close - at least I don't feel like one on the outside. 

My friends are people I just enjoy hanging out with, my closer friends are people I've known for longer and feel more comfortable sharing stuff with, and my parents are nice because they're here for me. Outside of that, I feel like I have no personal connections to them. As if they are mere placeholders for my 'friends' or 'parental unit' slots and if my life had played out differently, they would just be different people. They just happened to slip into those slots. I hate it.

I've been told I'm great with people and I sometimes act like a 'people person', but I just feel like I know what to say in certain situations and know how to play certain facades or tell people what they want to hear. In reality I like to spend time alone and a lot of times I feel like interactions with other people in my life are just keeping me from enjoying my time alone. Maybe that's why I kind of naturally distance myself from people. Not like purposefully, but like that kind of 'relationship decay' you get by not really interacting with someone for periods of time. I feel like everyone's 'rate of decay' is different, but maybe mine's worse because I don't value my connections in the first place. I don't think about anyone other than myself.

If I do try to build my relationships, it's because I want something to come out of it - sometimes it can be escape from loneliness or other times just because I feel the need to because it's something I have to deal with in the future like co-workers - it 'feels right' to. Otherwise it's incredibly rare of me to reach out to people myself. You've probably heard of the memed term 'npc energy'. Wow, that hurted. I don't think I've felt the need to get closer to someone because I found them intriguing or whatever. Am I just super introverted?

I've kind of thought of this as I grew up and it's been a constant source of sadness for me, but I guess I've never really been able to or invested the effort to put it into words until now. One of my friends recently was cheated on by their SO of almost two years and he keeps going on about how she probably never really cared about him outside of the relationship. As if their bond together was forged out of something functional and once she had other options, she replaced him without looking back. It was striking because they were basically the best of friends too and although I can't think of myself doing anything close to that, I can't help but feel like that's me but in more than just a relationship sense.

127,"Back when I was younger I developed insomnia at grade 3. I used to be so scared when it started getting dark because that feeling of being helpless and hopeless would return again. Sleeping at 3 and waking up at 6. 

I used to down cocktails of sleep aids/hormones to sleep and even after that I still couldn’t sleep. A few times it got to the point where I hadn’t slept for says and all I wanted was to close my eyes, it didn’t matter what it took and I just started to down every last pill in the medicine cabinet

What was so frustrating to me was that I always tried to find a common factor, see what i had done those days where I could sleep and try to replicate those results but I never could and I’d be so annoyed and mad thinking “this worked yesterday, why isn’t it working today” 

On most says as I was in my bed ready to sleep I’d be thinking “just let go, you’ll be able to sleep, let go” (for me the reason I thought I couldn’t sleep is because I had so much on my mind) and nope never worked. 

At 18 my insomnia fixed itself when I got out of my abusive parents house, it was like that house was physically causing my insomnia. I could sleep effortlessly when I was out. I returned a few times and I’d have some of my old sleep pills there. I would always take them because just the memories of my insomnia there haunted me and I didn’t want to risk not which able to sleep. 

Now, I’m out and on some night I start getting anxiety and repeating “let go, let go, let go” as I’m trying to fall asleep then next morning I wake up to be reminded that I don’t need to tell myself anything anymore because I can sleep now and that anxiety is just what is left over from back then.",05Aug2019,1
128,"today, my last friend admiddet she only stayed friends because she felt bad for me for not having any, but she couldn't do it anymore, the worst thing is that I don't even know why, my online friends all say I'm a nice person, and that they would want to hang out with me every day if they could, but anyone anywhere near me either doesn't want to be friends (or tries but fails) or is really annoying to the point where I would rather be alone, fuck my life, I don't trust people anymore if I ask them to be friends, and nobody asks me, please someone friendzone me",05Aug2019,14
129,"I'm a failed graphic designer. Nothing I've created for anyone in the past 10 years of experience has been worth showing to people to get paid for it. Or if they pay for it, no one's ever actually happy with it. 

I'd told myself that my current role was the last job I'd look in the creative field - if I failed at this, I'm leaving the industry altogether. 

And I'm at that point. I haven't lost my job yet, luckily, but it's only matter of time. My job hired another designer who has double the experience I do (without thinking to involve me in the process as it was promised to me), and she's already upstaged me on every project I've touched so far. So I'm at the point where I need to change industries or do something that I'm half decent at. 

My overall question - how do you switch careers when you don't have money for continuing education? What are some resources out there? I particularly wanted to be in nursing, but I can't afford nursing school. Any guidance?",05Aug2019,1
130,"I am a 20 year old student and currently live with my family. They totally accept what my choices are regarding my plans of career, and give advice with what I should do and what I shouldn't. 

For the past three years I've decided to become a commercial pilot. I took classes that focused on mathematics, physics, and other subjects that is involved in the art of flying. I enjoyed them, but each were stressful and just made me want to almost quit. 

I have a weeks left before the start of my last year before university life, but in the course of three years I've fallen in love with things I never even thought about even before deciding and planning out a life as a pilot. I figured that I love animals and want to learn about them. I love learning languages. I love cooking. I even love people! 

The growth that I had gone through, the pains and the failures, the regrets and mistakes have really taught me how to be wise in the choices that I make. And now, one year before focusing on what my career path will be like, I am unsure between becoming a pilot, or something else entirely.

I want to understand how people choose the career they want in their life, do the things they love, and how they decide to do it for the rest of their lives, regardless the amount of money they make along the way. 

I'm pretty confused right now.",05Aug2019,1
131,"I’m sad. I’m hurt. I’m scared. 

My wall has gone back up even though I’m trying so hard to be open. I’m trying so incredibly hard but it’s not good enough. 

I’m tired of having to justify myself as if I have something to prove. 

I’m sad because I don’t feel heard or understood.

I’m hurt because I’ve been judged. 

I’m scared to be vulnerable and raw. 

I’m full of so much emotion, where days like this drive me mad. 

I’m not lonely, but I’m alone.",05Aug2019,1
132,"For the past 4 years, I've been severely depressed and suicidal all the time. At 15 years old, I've already attempted to end my life at least half a dozen times.
I just don't know what to do, my dark thoughts and plans come in uncontrollable impulses. One day I stole 100 bucks, ran away from home, bought a helium tank (for an exit bag), but then I had to postpone my suicide attempt until I could find a perfect opportunity. However the next day I really didn't want to die and was very optimistic and excited about living life, only to find myself planning how I could maximise the lethality of my device the following day.
I've been in therapy for a year and I'm getting no significant results.
I seem to know without the shadow of a doubt that when I die, whether it be today or in a decade, it will be by my own hands.
I wish I had a major depressive episode and that it would pass and that would be it, but unfortunately, I believe I'm affected by chronic depression. I live in Canada but at the moment I'm on vacation in Tunisia, which only makes this whole deal weirder, like who thinks about asphyxiating themselves with an inert gas while relaxing on the beach?",05Aug2019,1
133," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.iv seen dudes sit there and she seems different and happy and then she’s all bubbly then as opposed to her usually being snotty af


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",05Aug2019,0
134,"My credit card/debit are all locked and I’m in a tiny island in the middle of nowhere with no one to lend me money. 

I can’t call to see what’s up since I’m 3 hours behind (time zone) and my work schedule won’t let me call from work. 

I have no car pretty much trapped, 

I have a traffic ticket back in mainland that isn’t getting resolved. Can’t fight it because I’m in this stupid island, can’t pay it because not there and it doesn’t show up online and can’t call the courthouse clerk for the same reason as the banking reason. 

Someone just murder me",05Aug2019,2
