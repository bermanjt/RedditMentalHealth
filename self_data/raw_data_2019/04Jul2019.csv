0,"so. I think I need to see a therapist. the only problem with that is I HATE talking to people about my problems and to people I don't trust / know. another basic problem is that I don't want to tell my mom because she won't believe me. well, she might but she won't take it seriously. I think if I can't find courage to tell her, I'll rant on here about my stupid problems that take over me and nobody can be my therapist but myself.

if you were wondering, I want to go to see if they can help me. some people probably think that's weird, because they might hate therapy, but I think it would be the best option. I can't even go to one of those websites, because you either need to pay money, or you can't be anonymous. I don't want people to know who I am, because my friends think I'm happy, and when I'm sad my parents say ""where'd my happy girl go?"". even though I probably have to get diagnosed with what I think I have.

7,"It has been always a desire for me was to be best among my friends. Was to be outstanding. But it has been always a spirit inside me to challenge others. I always fond the fact to learn something new something i would use in my everyday life. To inspire ppl, to make them feel better. I think i found it guys. It has been there all the time. I need to take the first step lads. To read &amp; become knowledgeable, to take risks in my outer circle. New decisions. But in this kind of world sometimes u need some partnership &amp; ppl nowadays are not trustworthy &amp; to find some kind of ppl is insignificantly difficult. So i just have to proceed with my self development until i pump into the right person, cross path in other words. I also noticed most of the time i lack motivation bec I FEAR CHANGE. Exactly!! I fear change, oh god who doesnt! I mean we are changing to the best so i believe its not wrong or bad thing so destroy old habits into more productive, fascinating habits. So what im trying to prove is, i read once a wise man say ‚Äú Always go with the decision that fears u the most.‚Äù So i believe it figure it out!!! :)",04Jul2019,2
8,"Shape changes in your life where they're needed. Accept that they won't happen overnight and remember that change only takes place in the presence of conscious effort.

Explore your priorities. Remember that time is the most honest measure of what you value. Abandon the pursuit of fruitless distractions.

Save the money you were going to spend on that shiny new thing, spend it on a new experience instead.

Look for humor in every situation; it's there if you look closely.

Spend more time away from the screen; there are cute cats in real life too.

Take excellent care of yourself. Health is wealth.

Seize opportunities while you can. If you don't, someone else will.

Treasure the people in your life that care about you, one day they'll be gone.

Create things. Draw, paint, compose, write, sculpt, cook . . .

Be present in the time you've been given. Turn off your cell phone.

Shift your focus outward, the world needs more selflessness.

Accept the fact that there is always room for growth in life. Remember - if you're not seeking growth, you're embracing stagnation.

Set goals. Set lots of goals. It's amazing what you can accomplish when you set your mind to it.

It would be nice to hear you, to talk to you. I could do with some advice honestly, I'm not sure what to do, not sure how to feel about something. It would be nice to play some music, have one our of philosophy debates again.

I want to talk about you, tell people about you - but it is just too painful.

I want to remember you, I want to cherish our memories and carry one with the strength that you gave me - but it is just too painful.

I want to cry, I want to scream, I want to let all my emotions out but I can't, I feel numb and hollow. I have no more tears, no more feeling. As paradoxical as it may be, the numbness hurts the most.

This emptiness, this loneliness terrifies me. Nothing I do helps. I don't want to feel so alone but I can't let anyone else in, I'm scared of losing more, scared that I'll hurt someone else, scared that I'll feel and cause more pain - at least now the only person I am hurting is myself.

14,"I'm not sure if this is a rant or a cry for help. Probably both. I just don't care. I'm currently at summer break in my house (going to junior year in high school), I don't try to do anything productive, I don't want to try, I don't see the point in trying, and there is nothing there that helps push me. Friends have tried to get me up and going, but it'll work for a week or so and then I'll be back in my old routine of nothing.

I don't even care about doing sports at my school. I just don't have a lot of option. I currently 6'3 and skinny. Earlier this year, I went to all the spring ball practice for football and work out with them all spring. After ALL these months of practice. The coach told my brother, behind my back, that the only good thing I was useful was FOOTBALL MANGER. This just killed off my motivation for doing Football at my school. As a result, I haven't been going to any summer practice or weight training or ANYTHING. I just don't care about doing football anymore. I made a lot of friend doing it but what the point if the coaches are just going to bring you down.

I don't care about being with friends or making new connections- I did at the beginning and I really liked doing it, but now everyone has settled in to their places and the whole ""meeting new people to make friends"" thing has kind of died down. I don't have any success in girls. I never had a girlfriend in my life or someone who even liked me. I don't have as much fun at high school as I should. My friends don't trust me with anything calling me ""goofy"" or some other insult (Not to mention the whole school treat me like some kind of monster or stranger). They never invite me to anything, as a result, I missed out at everything.

I have lots of things I want to learn and do with my life, but I can't even bring myself to do what I'm required to do. I just feel like wasted space with no interest in bettering myself or being a productive member of society.

And even when I do get out of these holes, which happens somewhat often, it's only temporary and then I fall back in to the same habit of not caring about anyone or myself. I have no money, no one who really cares about me, girls find me weird and creepy, shitty clothes, shitty grades, (GPA is 1.4), now matter how hard I tried to gain weight. I always end up skinny, and the worst part of it? It's not even that I hate any of this. I hate feeling like this, but not even enough to do something about it. I hate my grades, but it's not like Ds look different from As when you receive your diploma. No one really cares about me (especially in the way that I feel I need. It's been months since someone told me they liked me and I blew it!!!), so why should I care about myself anymore? Clearly I'm not good enough for anyone, yet for some reason that's good enough for me.

Or is there something just wrong with me?",04Jul2019,1

16,"I am only writing this here because i don't know where else to put it, i don't feel comfortable enough with any of my friends to share this with, i wish to get that out of the line because first of foremost, you shouldn't look at me with pity or empathy. 

I'm not a good person, i'm a cheater, and i'm a liar, and as bad as i feel about being those things, and as much as i try to improve, ultimately, that's all i'll ever ammount to being, i've dealt with depression for most of my life, i spent my teenage years mostly alone and the times iwasn't alone i can only look back to with regret, i've hurt countless people unecessarily along my way, i've lied to seem cooler, i've lied to people i love, i've hurt people i love.

Last year i had the best relationship of my life, we were pretty damn happy, i think it was my first real happy relationship, it was a bit difficult, me being19 and her being 16, but we didn't go any further than some kissing, she was asexual, and honestly, i was ok with that, she was a wonderful person, i was more than willing to give up on a sexually active life if it meant i could be with her, it was also my first healthy relationship, we didn't have any serious problems with jealously, mostly joking around, and if we had, we just talked to each other about it, we supported each other, i tried my best to be good, but all i can think now is that i didn't deserve any of that

She caught me flirting with a girl on my phone, a pretty close friend, per say, it was mostly out of... insecurity, i suppose? i don't know why i did it, honestly, i know i hate myself for it nowadays, she was rightfully pissed, we broke up, she decided to cut all contact with me, i tried my best to respect that, but i tried contacting her twice, once one month after everything went down, and once more about a month ago.

I remember the days following that, we still tried to talk to each other, but i was becoming more and more insecure and toxic, she was spending lots of time with a friend and i was very, very jealous, not exactly afraid she was involved with him romantically, but he just could... spend time with her, which i couldn't anymore, for understandable reasons, after questioning her about it, it's when she decided to cut it all off.

Since then things have only gone downhill, i made the mistake of attributing all my self worth on the fact that she thought i was good enough for her, how couldn't i? i mean, if such a good person liked me, i couldn't be that bad, could i? yeah, and then i fucked up, and all that went down the drain, nowadays i just feel... i don't know, below trash, i've lost all contact with our social group, i don't think i'm worthy of good things, i don't think i'm worthy of being happy, which is pretty convenient, because i haven't felt that in a while now.

I'm making a music box, i mean, i'm making a music box for her, it's one of those where you insert your own song in a strip of paper and turn the crank, it's my first woodworking project, it's turning out pretty good if i may say so myself, all i have to do now is snad, put on some varnish and screw the hinges in, and then it'll be done, and that thought is fucking me up bad.

I don't know what i'll do once it's done, i don't know how i'd give it to her, i've spent hours making this, i've made many songs she loves, and i don't know if i should give it to her, i don't know if that would be... emotionally manipulative? i'm worried about that, i don't know if she'd want to receive that, i don't know if she hates me, but i can only think that she does, i know a few of our common ""friends"" do, i don't know if i should give it to someone so they can give it to her, and i don't know if it'd only hurt more if i gave it to her, especially if i actually go through with that i plan on doing

Stuff hasn't been going too great, obviously, but recently (last three months) those thoughts, the ones about ending it all, have been getting stronger and stronger, i don't think i would be missed, i don't think there would be much impact on it all, i mean, of course there'd be that initial thud, c'mon, someone died, but after that... i don't think it'd take too long to recover? both my parents are pretty absent in my life, i don't have any close friends at this point, my mental illness has only made me isolate myself and i'm not making any effort against it because honestly, i'm ok with that, i want that, i want to kill myself, i want to drive myself to such a state that i can kill myself without hesitation, i want to have the guts to finally do it, it'd feel like i was finally doing something good, finally doing something to impact people's lives positively.

I'm already taking pills, i'm already going to therapy, and it's not getting better, it's only getting worse, i know i'm trash, so i think that'd be the one good deed in my life.

I don't know if i want to stop these thoughts, i don't know if i want to go through with them, i don't know if i want to get better or if i want to get worse, i don't know anymore.

I just want this to end already, and i don't know what to do",04Jul2019,2

22,"Back in my school days I used to have this group of friends, and we used to do everything together. Have epic hangouts, discover new movies, places, foods, etc. Have timeless stupid discussions day in day out. It was so fun. Also things like financial status, health issues, etc didn‚Äôt bother us.

As years passed, we started living in different parts of the city, which became difficult for us to meet regularly. They found new friends in their area. Me being the stupid one ignored getting close to people in my area, and still kept texting them to see if they‚Äôd like to hangout or go discover new place or just talk. But most of the time I get back reply saying they are busy or tired and didn‚Äôt want to do things we used to do a year ago.

So I kept going to these places alone.

And this is where things start to fuck up. I think this is where I started to get my anxiety in meeting new people and getting too close to them.

Now years later, even though I have new friends, I don‚Äôt get close to them. I would love to watch a new movie, I ask them once, then I would get this extreme fear that they will say no, so instead of asking them again or clearly stating that I really want to watch that new movie, I choose the second pathetic path. I instead secretly buy tickets to the movie, go alone, and then build lie over lie on how I pirated the movie instead, I was sick so I couldn‚Äôt answer their calls while in theatre, won‚Äôt share anything about the movie on social media, go to a theatre miles away from their place so I won‚Äôt get caught. And all this stuff gets me anxious and then stressed and guilty. It sucks.

Also their financial background comes into picture. I don‚Äôt care spending few bucks to watch a movie in theatre when it releases but my friends won‚Äôt. So it also adds more stress on me, I feel like an A-hole asking them to watch movies with me. 

If I suggest a new place they jokingly say we‚Äôll go if you give us a treat there. I‚Äôm not financially stable to give out treats twice a week! I just save up money from other activities for such things.


How do I deal with it? Should I find joy in other things that we could do together instead? But I really wanna be at the concert but then I‚Äôd have to go alone. And give a thousand lied after. How do I get more confidence to ask and state clearly what I want. How do I get over that fear that if I ask something they will say no?",04Jul2019,1

My name is Max, and i give up, since my childhood im always being the ""diferent"" child, smart, polite and carismatic. To adults at least, kids use to tear me apart because how nerd i was (and still am).
Getting in my teens i started to wish of being part of a group, like in the cartoons a bunch of friends who have eachother and had great aventures but in every group of ""friends"" i had i was the clown, you know make the laugh with stupit shit so they stayed.
That was kinda the same in the dating department, always putting my self down just to get someone to like me.
Highschool and college came..... Mostly the same, trying my best to be likeble but ""interesting"". I major in psychology (haha ironic) and i was at the peek of my life, good grades, a lovely girlfriend a group of loyal friends and on therapy (mandatory to graduate) so i was on good tracks, until i figure out that i didnt know how happiness feels....
Im sad, im angry, im not happy, every laugh every kiss and word i say was and act, the same act of being likable , my friends were all having the time of their lives, and every problem they have i was there (drunken outbrust, breakups, fights with family, being 3am and needing someone to talk) i was always there and never ever they were for me.
Girlfriend being in an altar, i giving everything for her, me using every minute and dollar on her projecs but she didnt know me I didnt know myself.
So i beggin to fall down, fail my career, stop speaking to all my friends (spoiler they didnt seak me, not even once) and my girlfriend decides to leave with me, only to fight every now and then, and harm eachother.
Yesterday i decide to open to her about the noise on my head, i was (still) losing it. I was again having suicidal toughs (i tried to kill myself two times before) and i tell her ""im losing it, i feel in the most distrace , i just want you to care and dont judge me pls"" her responce: ""I know its hard but did you know how sad it makes me feel to hear that, its sadder for me to see you""
Its harder for her to have a title, to being studing her masters from home, not working at all (i pay the rent, groseries, her school, and all of the things aroud the house)  have a good relationship with her parents and having me always smiling an caring for her, supporting everything she does.

39,"Today was my 1 year anniversary with my girlfriend, whom I‚Äôve been living with for a while now. There‚Äôs always been a feeling that I can‚Äôt bring good to others, only pain, and today really drove that home. I‚Äôm divorced, have two kids, already feeling like a crap parent. Her? She‚Äôs got three from her own previous marriage and is pregnant with ours. I love her and her kids.

Today, we took one of the girls shopping for a dress, and I let two of the dogs outside who normally stay together. The third, who usually goes to another spot, went outside with them because my girlfriend was out there and when I called him back in, he just ignored me. So, I thought ‚Äúokay fine.‚Äù

When I walked back in the gate upon returning, I saw the third one laying there, dead with obvious bite marks. Only one of the three was strong enough: mine. They have had their squabbles before, and the now dead one was a bit grumpy with a much larger dog. The real kicker was that mine got out and got into a fight with a dog that was deemed ‚Äúself defense‚Äù by animal control because the other dog had been causing fights in the neighborhood which roamed pretty often. My dog. My dog that I already felt had caused issues because, yes, I wanted him, yet asked multiple times if she was really Okay with getting.

My fault for letting the dead dog go with him. Stay outside for an extended period of time with him. With my dog, whom I had really tried to get under control recently because he was hyper and we have a kid coming and doing much better.

They‚Äôve had him longer than I‚Äôve been in the picture. I loved him also. I feel like a total failure to him, my girlfriend and the kids. I feel like all I‚Äôve done anytime is fail everyone around me, and reached  a dark place again. I don‚Äôt even know what I even offer is anything worth a shit, especially now.

40,"My boyfriend has nights where he just hangs out with his friends and plays videogames with them. I'm so happy he's found a good group of friends to socialize with now, since he's had some issues with maintaining friendships in the past and it contributed to his depression.

My issue is that he, the sweetest bf in the world, LOVES to include me in activities with his friends. Playing videogames, going out to eat, going to tournaments, etc. I love doing these, too, and a couple of his friends I'm pretty close with... but my anxiety gets so bad that I talk too much and I start shaking. My voice will shake, too, so it's even more obvious. Aaaaaaand then the fact that it is obvious will make me even more anxious. 

I tried to hang out with them without my boyfriend before. Ended up taking breaks in the bathroom trying to hold back tears and calm myself down. Wasn't very fun.

So tonight he invites me to play with two of his friends. One of them I'm close with, the other not so much. I'd be fine with the one friend, but throw a stranger in the mix and I can't function. 

Anyone have tips for how to cope in these situations? I want to be able to hang out with my boyfriend and his friends so that it doesn't feel like he's having to choose between the two. I feel like that's unfair to him, and I want to be better so that doesn't happen.",04Jul2019,1

To be clear, I don't have any problem approaching people. I'm not socially awkward and can keep a conversation. I meet a lot of people at bars or in community classes, but none of them tend to stick around. All the advice I can find online seems to be directed at people who have trouble putting themselves out there, but I don't feel that way at all. I feel like something about my personality is keeping people away to the point that they don't want to attach themselves to me.

This past year hasn‚Äôt been great for me. I went to my first year of college and I decided to transfer; I applied to 10 schools and got rejected from my top 6. The rest didn‚Äôt give me enough money. I decided on one and I‚Äôm excited about it, but now more problems are surfacing. They do not offer on campus housing, so I have to get an apartment.

I don‚Äôt know if I can go anymore. College is extremely important for me-as I would like to become a pediatric neurosurgeon. On the topic of money, my family‚Äôs financial situation is terrible. My mother has been breaking down throughout this year, and about a month ago it finally just blew up. She was fired and that also meant everyone‚Äôs health insurance went with it. Also, she went missing for a few hours and we found her on the side of our house hiding. She was drunk (she‚Äôs an alcoholic) and she kept repeating to me that she wanted to die. I decided to admit her into a psych ward. She got out 3 weeks later, but one day ago, my brother found her laying in the hallway. She had taken ambien and downed it with half a box of wine. There are many more family problems, but I won‚Äôt bore anyone with the details. The worst thing to happen; however, is my beloved cat, Logan, passed away a few days ago. I got him when I was five and he was my best friend ever since. I miss him so much that it hurts. So, this is just some of what is going on in my life and I‚Äôm not sure how to handle it.

57,"Hey 
I‚Äôll try to keep this short 
I have other posts in my post history that go on about what‚Äôs wrong with me. 
I haven‚Äôt wanted to live for a long time now. I‚Äôm too ashamed to get help, I don‚Äôt want help. I like feeling this way I don‚Äôt know any different. I grew up in an abusive household in a cult environment where I never really learned how to fully control my emotions so I don‚Äôt really feel anything anymore. I‚Äôve lived a dull, numb existence for the last 7 years. I‚Äôve been heavily medicated on so many different medicines to try and ‚Äúfix‚Äù me and I‚Äôve been in therapy since I was a preteen. 
Nothing seems to fix it. The bad outweighs the good and the good never seems worthwhile anyways because it‚Äôs all fleeting and is followed by horrible consequences. If I enjoy anything I‚Äôm punished. 
You can tell me all you want that life won‚Äôt always be this way but I hear that bullshit all the time, I don‚Äôt have any real answers about how to solve this problem and it would be so much easier if I just wasn‚Äôt here. I don‚Äôt even feel suicidal or depressed, I don‚Äôt have a longing for death. I don‚Äôt desire it. It‚Äôs a strange feeling. I can‚Äôt do it because I‚Äôll hurt someone around me, there‚Äôs one person I care about hurting. 
But I don‚Äôt want to be alive, I wish I wasn‚Äôt born so I wasn‚Äôt put on the burden of living because I feel like I can‚Äôt choose to live or die. I can‚Äôt do what I want in life because all my freedoms are choked forever because of all this bullshit I was born into and I can‚Äôt die because I have people that care about me who would hate me if I did. 
Sometimes I wish horrible things would happen to me, other times I want to kill myself. I do want to die constantly, but I just know I can‚Äôt by my own hand.",04Jul2019,1
58,"I honestly looked at myself in the mirror the last few days and I felt disgusted.

I dont fit into most of my clothes anymore, my face looks fatter and I'm feeling depressed over it so I'm going to try and do something about it. 

What really bugs me is the attitude of everyone close to me in my life about me losing weight. They ALWAYS say ""Oh you 5ft 9inches you aren't suppose to be on the slim side/ you carry it well because of your height/you'll look ill/your better the way you are"" or some other variation of what I've just described. I'm 14 stone for fucks sake, I'm tired of being fat and sick of being told to just live with it. 

I've tried counting carbs, tried fasting, tried everything and so far nothing has worked because I keep falling off the wagon and having phases of emotional eating. If I could have appetite surpressants I would, but I'm in the UK so medicines like that are tightly controlled and are only prescribed to people much heavier than me. I'm honestly just so depressed about it and I'm scared of getting fatter still. I look fucking hideous at the moment and I want to look like ""me"" again when I was 10 and a half stone.

I‚Äôm writing this stream of conscious. It‚Äôs exhausting to talk about. No one really knows since I can‚Äôt talk to my friends about it. I‚Äôve brought up how I feel with my boyfriend and he always says ‚Äúif I didn‚Äôt want to date you why would I still be with you?‚Äù What do I even say to that?

I just want to date someone who acts like they‚Äôre attracted to me and who acts like they‚Äôre proud to be in a relationship with me. Maybe there‚Äôs nothing to be proud of and nothing to be attracted to. 

I just feel like things are damaged beyond repair now because I really pulled myself away from him after realizing he rarely reciprocated anything  just so I could avoid being hurt as much.

61,"My gym teacher in high school was an enormous white guy named Robert Kelly. Because there were two teachers with the last name Kelly, on school paperwork he was listed as R. Kelly. He was the school gym teacher for over 35 years and was one of the most beloved figures to walk the halls. 

R. was an incredibly nice guy who knew that high school kids just wanted to hang during gym, so everything was low effort and everyone loved him. They also loved him because at some point during the 70s, Pennsylvania had a program where high school students could get their licenses at school. The program was eventually discontinued but anyone who had been certified was still eligible to run driver's ed and give the test. So for over 35 years, R. taught thousands upon thousands of kids how to drive. 

Taking driver's ed with R. was preferential for many reasons. It was easy to schedule right before or after school, you were with friends, etc. But mainly, R. was incredibly lax. You had to drive with him a few times before the test and he'd always say the same thing: ""If you have any alcohol or weed or other drugs, pass 'em up to me ‚Äì I'll take good care of 'em.""

When I say he was incredibly lax, I don't just mean his attitude. I mean he probably passed hundreds of kids who didn't deserve it, my brother included. My brother took his test a few days  before Christmas. When my brother took the test he rolled through a stop sign (a ""California stop"" as R. called it), and at one point went too far over the speed limit. When they were finishing up and my brother was about to turn into the high school parking lot, he hit the wind shield wipers instead of the turn signal. When he parked, R. looked at him and said ""it wouldn't have been the same if you hadn't done that but at the end. Merry Christmas."" And with that he tore out a piece of paper saying my brother passed.

Negligent? Absolutely. But when you're a kid in high school it didn't matter. R. gave you freedom. This is where it gets really good though. R. never made anyone parallel park. Ever. When I was doing my lessons with him I asked if we'd need to know how to do it. He said, ""You live in Bucks County, when the fuck are you ever going to need to know how to parallel park?""

Well, eventually R. retired, and a few short years later he passed away. He lived in Philly, and services were held there. Over a thousand people showed up, many of whom R. taught how to drive. There were nine parking spots in the church lot, and the rest was street parking. It was total mayhem. The man giving the eulogy started off by joking that it was the last prank he ever played. 

Anyway, just thought that was a funny little story and didn't know where else to share it. Also, I did eventually learn how to parallel park, but the first time I ever tried in Baltimore it was like that scene from Austin powers where he's caught in that cart in the hallway. Anywho, cheers to R. Kelly, the fat white driving teacher.",04Jul2019,32

It is so important that we not to be defined by tragedy, but rather shaped by it. 

It has taken me a long time to live by these words. Was I a victim? Yes. Am I a survivor? Absolutely 

A little over a year ago I began writing my thoughts and memories down. Sometimes they were detailed recollections and sometimes just random thoughts. I have always loved writing, poetry being my favorite, but I have found no pleasure in writing entries into what I now call ‚ÄúMy Journal. My Journey‚Äù.  I have not enjoyed a single second of it, but I now know that it was something I needed. It has been excruciatingly painful to go back there in my mind, and there were times throughout my writing process that I did not think I could possibly bear any more of the flood of emotions I was feeling, but I found my way through. I am sharing this with you now because I want you to know that you can find your way through too. 

*You can make new memories in your home now, the home that we started our lives and family in, but you know the secrets within those walls too. When you lay your head down each night and close your eyes, do you see? As you drift off to sleep does your mind take you back? Do the horrible memories trapped in those bedroom walls ever enter your nightmares? Can you see the shadow of your fist raging into the wall, leaving a dark and empty hole? Do you see the forceful swinging of your hand against my tender cheek in slow motion like I still do? Do the secrets from downstairs ever creep up through the floor at night and find their way into your dreams? Do they show your hands wrapped tightly around my neck, my feet unable to reach the floor, carrying me motionless into the room our bedroom used to be in and throwing me onto the bed? Do they recreate this scene for you more than once, just as I had to live through it? Does your subconscious mind ever take you into the kitchen late at night, when silence fills the air, to the back door where you are looking into my tear filled eyes as I stand on the back porch looking back into your eyes filled with rage just as your arms reach out and push me down the stairs? 
Do all of those vulgar words ring in your ears as you sleep? Do they sting you like they did me? Do they shoot straight through your heart and deep into your soul and leave scars that will forever remain? All your sarcasm and hateful words. All the horrible names you could think of calling me that rolled off your tongue with such ease.*

I know my experiences in life mirror those of so many others and each of our stories are sprinkled with their own uniqueness. I cannot even begin to count how many times I have cried until there were no tears left to cry, or how many times I struggled to find the words to adequately describe the pain I felt which I tried desperately to keep buried deep down inside myself.  

I realize now that there is no need for me to try and do these things because I no longer allow my past to define who I am. I can now see how the many lessons I have learned from my experiences are all helping to shape the person I am becoming. 

Life is a journey...full of blessings and heartbreaks, triumphs and trials, beauty and darkness. 

I have walked a long and winding road, with a great deal more to go...so If you find yourself lost in life please know you‚Äôre not alone. 

Never give up hope that you can  become who you want to be. 
And if you‚Äôre feeling lost right now,...
please come and walk with me. 

Love,
Simply_Re",04Jul2019,2

Even so, it‚Äôs still hard to ignore the looming shadow hanging over me every day. And that shadow is 8-10 hrs a day, 40-50 hrs a week. Close to 60 during the holidays. It actually hangs over me the entire time before I go to work too. It‚Äôs really hard for me to think of a job as anything more than wage slavery. Of course, when you enjoy your job it‚Äôs a different story. 
  You may be thinking, ‚ÄúWell, why don‚Äôt you find a new job? Why don‚Äôt you try to find something you like?‚Äù I‚Äôve tried over and over again. For years. And years. And years. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I won‚Äôt be happy working in retail, customer service, fast food, restaurant, warehousing, or call center work. And that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm qualified for. 
  Now you may be thinking, ‚ÄúWell, why don‚Äôt you go back to school?‚Äù I already have student loans that I can‚Äôt afford to pay right now that I had to place in forbearance. I‚Äôm not totally sure what other options I have, but considering I already owe enough money in student loans, I‚Äôm not sure if it would be the best investment.
   I‚Äôve thought about doing freelance work on the internet, but I can‚Äôt even afford a laptop right now, and the top of the line ones are ridiculously expensive.
  I do think I would be happiest working for myself, but I don‚Äôt feel like I have the resources at the moment. With all of the financial responsibilities I have, it doesn‚Äôt look like my chances are very good that I ever will.
  If it seems like I‚Äôm whining and making a bunch of excuses, maybe I am. One thing I know for sure is that I‚Äôm frustrated, overwhelmed, irritated, anxious, depressed, and losing steam with every passing day.
  It seems like the only help I can get is the same tired crap I‚Äôve heard over and over. Sayings like, ‚Äú try to be more positive,‚Äù ‚ÄúTry to see the bright side of things,‚Äù ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs too short to worry so much,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so negative,‚Äù ‚Äú You have to do what you have to do,‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just the way life is,‚Äù ‚ÄúIt will get better,‚Äù ‚ÄúJust keep trying.‚Äù I‚Äôve tried motivational quotes. They help for a little while, until I see the same ones over and over. Or read one that‚Äôs so short-sighted it annoys me.

70,"This is really embarassing, but screw it.

About a couple of weeks ago, I got what I thought was a pimple on my ass, right in between both of my buttcheeks. It's happened before but it's gone away by itself so I didn't care much this time. 

But, after a few days, it became really painful that I couldn't walk, sit, or sleep comfortably. One day, I take a look in the mirror, and it's literally like a small, white dot causing all this.

I proceed to self cure it by placing towels soaked in hot water and then when it dries, applying Neosporin. This went on for like 3-4 days and now here's the ""fun"" part.

On the Tuesday that just passed, I was eating some soup by myself when I suddenly smelled a weird odor but I passed it off. After eating, I decided to take a nap, but when I woke up, I felt something gooey on my ass that smelled like the disgusting odor from before so I rushed to the restroom.

I thought I had accidentally shit myself in my sleep but I hadn't, it was a bloody mess. Turns out it was coming from the ""pimple"" or whatever the hell was on my ass. I hopped into the shower  and when I got out, it started to bleed again - like it would not stop bleeding!

I still keep using the same remedy from before (using the hot towels and Neosporin) and it stops bleeding for a while. Every few hours, it'll start bleeding and I don't know how to stop it.

This is the first time this has happened and I sure as hell know this wasn't from  a pimple. Has anyone had a similar experience and would please share some remedies or something to stop this complete madness? And can someone tell me what even is this ""pimple"" thingy supposed to be?!?",04Jul2019,1
73,"So, almost anything I hear, see, or read gets linked to some stupid pop culture or movie/TV reference. For instance, I just saw a post on Reddit about an MTF transgender person, and in the title was the word ""mission"".

So, what did my fucked up brain start doing? I started humming the dumbass theme song to Rocket Power and started re-wording the lyrics to be about a transgender/sex person on a mission to change their gender/sex.

This seriously happened almost instantaneously. I can't fucking stop! It has been this way for years. I am scared that it has metastasized or something.

I then saw another post of a guy jumping off a ledge of a platform onto a trampoline, and bounce back up and fall off the other side onto another trampoline. While I saw this I started thinking of the Beverly Hills Cop theme. Why did I start thinking of this? Because when I was a kid I had a VHS copy of some Eddie Murphy movie and one of the ads on the VHS was of all Eddie Murphy's movies with that music playing. And there was a clip of some movie where Eddie Murphy was doing a random sort of elongated flip through the air. So, I tie that dumb fucking music to people flipping in the air and vice versa!

Another one I cannot stop doing is whenever I see a clip of some real life footage where chaos is erupting, or has potential to erupt, I start thinking of the horrible Grateful Dead song ""Hell in a Bucket"".

By the way, all of this is not tied to clips on Reddit. There are things I hear in a conversation that I will link to something in a movie or a TV show in some way, shape, or form.

Does this sound like a form of ADD? Or, is it possible that I just have too much fucking free time on my hands?",04Jul2019,1
74,"As the time passed, we've have been encouraged to live up to the expectations of having to be tough. We get sad too, but society made us feel ashamed, embarrassed for the simple fact we want to show our emotions. We need help, but we're scared others will make fun of us for desiring to get the help we've been craving. 

I don't feel comfortable talking about the way I feel because society taught me I was supposed to cry only if I was in physical pain; because society taught me I wasn't supposed to cry for help, but be tough and keep going since I was born male. Sometimes I wish I wasn't ashamed of who I am, that I could close my eyes, take a deep breath, calm down and finally talk about everything I have in my mind to the friends I encourage to vent. 

It was at the point when the only way I'd feel better was by doing self harm, something I regret to this day. It became an addiction, it was the only way I could express myself without getting any critique, expect the one from myself. 

How should I put it.. my heart is broken. The person I trusted the most turned out to be toxic. Although she kept encouraging me to be more emotionally open up to her, when I finally did she left me for being ‚Äúnot manly enough‚Äù.

My parents divorced when I was around 9 and quite frankly my father was a piece of work: short-tempered, abusive, a bit alcoholic and selfish. My mother got a PFA (Protection From Abuse) filed against him a few times and after that my family and I cut off most/all contact with him. I grew up teaching myself and my little brother how to be a good man, learning how to navigate the world, and vowing not to make the same mistakes he did. I know that in the years since he's remarried and I think mentally grown up a lot. I haven't talked to him in years except for his annual Happy Birthday card he sends us.

I don't know how many years my parents have left on this Earth and I can't help but think that it would be beneficial for us both if we got to see each other again man-to-man and try to move forward. I don't live in the same state anymore but I might know his number and I come back every once in a while. I just feel like if I was in his shoes I'd want to reconnect with my son before I died.

81,"Beginning of this year, I was diagnosed with depression.  Not very severe, mind you. It was bad but I could still go to school and take care of myself. The worst memory I have of it is when I was in bed late at night, listening to music as I always do. Flight of the Navigator by Childish Gambino started playing. It is an extremely sad song but I like those kind of songs.

She objected to video chat because she was an extremely private type. It didn‚Äôt matter to me, because i loved talking to her. However, there was no physical contact. That‚Äôs what fucked it up.

82,"So as mentioned I am 24 years old.

I've never been in a serious relationship, but have had flings and stuff like that. But I am so confused as to what I am which probably has led to why the fuck I've never been in a relationship.

So my first love was in highschool with this girl. I was infatuated with her. But we never had sex because she wasnt ready and I wasnt gonna push her. Then things kinda just broke off amicably. Then I went to college, and had a few sexual flings with some girls. Then came my sophomore year and I was super curious as to having a sexual experience with a guy. So I ended up getting head. And that's now led to this immense confusion I feel about myself.

Ever since then, I prefer watching gay porn to straight porn. I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that straight porn feels so fake and overdone that it honestly turns me off. Whereas gay porn seems more natural and less theatrical.

So like every night I'd rather just jerk it to gay porn. At the same time however, at this point  I liked  sex with girls and never really entertained the thought of doing anything more than recieving oral from a guy.

Then I got to my senior year and had my first actual act of intercourse with another guy after a long night of drinking. Immediately after I felt honestly pretty disgusted and did not like it at all. So at that point I was like ""my experimenting phase is over"" and I was solely hooking up with girls.

But now here I am today. At this part of my post is really delving into the immense confusion I feel towards my sexuality and the stress it imposes on me.

Soni still watch gay porn. When I finish, I feel disgusted with myself and say, that's really not what I want. But it turns me on so much watching and THINKING about sex with another man. But commiting to the act is something that I really tended to avoid

I always and forever envision myself in a relationship with a woman. I feel more intimate with women and dont see myself in the future being in a committed relationship with anyone but a woman.

However, I am sexually attracted to men as well so it leads to major anxiety in the bedroom.

There will be times where I will be having sex with a girl, enjoying it, then all of a sudden I'll fantasize about having sex with a man. Then I get anxious and lose my libido when I'm with the girl leading to embarrassment. Then suddenly I'll be all horned up and ready to go south the girl. It's like my brain is playing hopscotch with my sexuality and a daily basis.

So tonight I finally caved into the urge to have sex with a man again. So I did. I enjoyed it way more than the first time I did it, but after he left I was like ""that was fun? But I could never be in a relationship with another man""

I'm just so confused.i am sexually, and intimately attracted to women. But have really intense sexual urges towards men as well, but I would never be in an intimate relationship with a man.

So I feel lost and confused all the fucking time because I dont know what I want. It scares me to be in a relationship with a woman, because I know, deep down, that is what i want. But i fear my positive urges towards sex with a man would ruin any relationship I would ever hope to have.

It doesnt help that my whole life involved me being in a hyper masculine environment (baseball and football for most of my life) so I have been molded with these expected norms for men like me (basically girls, girls, girls) but deep inside I am more like (girls, boys, girls, boys).

I need advice. I'm so lost and confused and it caused me major anxiety. I want to be in a relationship so so SO bad, but I cant commit because I dont know what I am

TLDR: basically I am emotionally, sexually and intimately attracted to women and want to be in a relationship with a woman. But I also am sexually attracted to men (but would never want to be in a relationship with a man), I just like the thought and now the act of having sex with men..but that's about it.

85,"This title is not an understatement. Before I start getting tagged for being a dick allow me to explain. 

We were friends for a year and then started to talk about getting in a relationship and being flirtatious about 4 months ago. Before we anything was official or we established that we wanted to date, she let a guy eat her out in a party. 

This really hurt cause we were sort of in a thing and it came as a surprise. What happened after was that everybody found out and started slut shaming her and making jokes. 

I was there to comfort her and get her through it. I then found out from a friend that she explicitly said she wanted to go out with me and I played along until we became official. 

But now I have people coming up to me saying that she‚Äôs with me only to boost her social status after people slut shamed her or that I‚Äôm here for emotional support although she says otherwise. 

One other reason for my growing hate is that after that incident she wants to seem innocent and refuses to do any sexual acts with me which really pisses me off because I know this random guy has done more with my girl friend than I have.

She also takes so long to reply to chats and is extremely insecure and looks for acceptance anywhere which makes her wanna be friends with people who make fun of her and treat her like Shit. 

I have extremely mixed emotions towards her but I need to stay with her for two reasons. One, if I leave her I‚Äôm scared she will break and out relationship will be severed and she will have serious problems. Two, I‚Äôm not the type of guy to be pulling girls left and right so I‚Äôm scared that if I leave her I won‚Äôt find anyone else and she is my chance to be in a relationship.

i just hate being labelled as depressed and reject any association of it to myself. self mutilation, being unproductive, not studying or going to work.

to be fair, i tried to cut myself but decided that it was too painful and i rather game or eat something.

i don‚Äôt want to be seen as attention-seeking ( irl ). I‚Äôve often hear about people exaggerating their symptoms and immediately saying that they are mentally ill to the point that I don‚Äôt want to be like that.

even now, i avoid going to see a doctor because i think it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. once the doctor says that i have depression, there will be this persuasive force in my head that starts to use that as an excuse for everything.

i am not depressed yet when i think about my current state in life, i‚Äôm sad.

i‚Äôm not suicidal. i can find little joys in life from youtube videos to fiction and games. i have tons of safety nets to forcefully drag my mind out of a muck if i have to.

88,"I'm not sure if this is a rant or a cry for help. Probably both. I just don't care. I'm currently at summer break in my house (going to junior year in high school), I don't try to do anything productive, I don't want to try, I don't see the point in trying, and there is nothing there that helps push me. Friends have tried to get me up and going, but it'll work for a week or so and then I'll be back in my old routine of nothing.

I don't even care about doing sports at my school. I just don't have a lot of option. I currently 6'3 and skinny. Earlier this year, I went to all the spring ball practice for football and work out with them all spring. After ALL these months of practice. The coach told my brother, behind my back, that the only good thing I was useful was FOOTBALL MANGER. This just killed off my motivation for doing Football at my school. As a result, I haven't been going to any summer practice or weight training or ANYTHING. I just don't care about doing football anymore. I made a lot of friend doing it but what the point if the coaches are just going to bring you down.

I don't care about being with friends or making new connections- I did at the beginning and I really liked doing it, but now everyone has settled in to their places and the whole ""meeting new people to make friends"" thing has kind of died down. I don't have any success in girls. I never had a girlfriend in my life or someone who even liked me. I don't have as much fun at high school as I should. My friends don't trust me with anything calling me ""goofy"" or some other insult (Not to mention the whole school treat me like some kind of monster or stranger). They never invite me to anything, as a result, I missed out at everything.

I have lots of things I want to learn and do with my life, but I can't even bring myself to do what I'm required to do. I just feel like wasted space with no interest in bettering myself or being a productive member of society.

And even when I do get out of these holes, which happens somewhat often, it's only temporary and then I fall back in to the same habit of not caring about anyone or myself. I have no money, no one who really cares about me, girls find me weird and creepy, shitty clothes, shitty grades, (GPA is 1.4), now matter how hard I tried to gain weight. I always end up skinny, and the worst part of it? It's not even that I hate any of this. I hate feeling like this, but not even enough to do something about it. I hate my grades, but it's not like Ds look different from As when you receive your diploma. No one really cares about me (especially in the way that I feel I need. It's been months since someone told me they liked me and I blew it!!!), so why should I care about myself anymore? Clearly I'm not good enough for anyone, yet for some reason that's good enough for me.

89,"»¶s a teen, I was diagnosed and treated. I hated this. I didn't like that everyone liked me better when I was medicated. 

The events that led to me eventually being medicated, were also, in my view (at the time), adults ganging up on me for displaying legitimate anger towards an adult who had been rude and disrespectful as hell. 

Fast forward 5-6 years, I move out, studying at uni. At this point I was generally very depressive, and it only worsened. 

This continues into the next year, I begin to become increasingly anxious, nothing I seem to do seems to improve my standing in life (grades, money, friends, etc.). On two occasions, I puked while writing essays, because of anxiety. I'm always physically shakey on a day-to-day basis at this point, nauseous, etc. I think nothing of it.

A year later, I'm failing. I'm also working harder than ever. I'd be trying to study from when I wake up to when I sleep. A friend with ADHD who is medicated raised the possibility of it to me. I remember my diagnosis. I remember lingering bitterness about treatment, my family for making me have it, etc - I ended up believing in some pseudoscience about it. 

I'd generally (in my view) tried to liaise with everyone possible to get help in terms of lecturers and staff. 

I eventually decide what the hell, and go to my DR. Ask about ADHD treatment. A few appointments later, I go to see a consultant psychiatrist. He asks if I mind if a med student is in the room, I lie and say no. I fail to communicate anything about how I struggle in the meeting. He reads back to me his conclusions at the end. Some of it was factually incorrect. I didn't correct him. He concludes that I am not at the threshold for treatment, I'm dejected and feel I've wasted my time, but know that I am not a DR and that with the information he was given he was totally correct, and that it was my fault for failing to communicate.

I fail that year. 

I generally become obsessed with discipline, routines, productivity, etc. I resit the year. People tell me I work harder than anyone. I am working all the time on uni work. Family tell me I'm going to make myself ill when I stay. For all my effort, I am failing. Friends assume I am doing fine because I never see them (always working), whenever I do I never bother to correct them, as they are stressed too with their work, I try to reassure them about their own life.

By this point I'm in significant debt, and drowning in guilt because family helped me with money, and I failed and am jobless. 

I fail that year. Move back home.

About a month ago, when looking for some hayfever tablets, my mother found some of my old meds. Knowing that they're taken under supervision for good reason, I decide what the hell anyway.

I remember my friend's dosage, I keep to the exact dosage (well, less for a week at first - I knew they titrate you onto it, and wanted to be precautions). 

The difference is night and day. I am doing things, like not just doing them but finishing them. I can think clearly. I manage to manage my time. I am still very anxious all the time, but now I can think clearly about it and tackle the issues. I don't know how to explain it. My mind is quiet, it feels like I am actually 'here' in a way that I usually am not. I feel like I can cope, I feel like I am capable enough to do things for others, I want to get up in the morning, I am excited about my day. Etc.

Today, I took the last one. A half dose. I don't know if I want to go through the humiliation of trying to get treatment again, but it's really messing with me that I could be leading a better life. Or a life at all. I guess I just wanted to tell someone.",04Jul2019,2

 I was on this drug train with them for a little, till I realised I don't want to do drugs any longer because I feel scattered and stupid.

So I really made my self distant from them and am drifting away, recently one of them messaged me about telling him he missed me, but with my last few days I hung out around him, I noticed before how he was bringing up a lot how I am going to be rich (due to my moderately wealth family), and in my head I didn't like how he brought that up, can anyone else understand that? Like I don't feel appreciated like that, and every time I hang out around them I'm destined to do drugs or else it's weird.

I don't know, like yea I had great times, I will miss my friend alot, he made my highschool years great, but he is just not the same... hes too deep in this drug thing, and I know I can't do much about it or else he will retaliate, it does make me sad and lonely, but I don't want to end up like that. The result of this is making me lonely, plus I work so much it's hard to make friends, my 3 co workers is family, I work minimum 9 hours a day/6 days a week.

94,"I got back from a hiking trip about a week ago. Through boy scouts I spent 11 days hiking an itinerary of 68 miles, though with twists and turns it possibly was closer to 80. The highlight of this trip, in my opinion, was summiting Baldy Mountain. 12,441 feet.

The summit day was probably the most physically demanding day I'd ever had in my life, but it was so rewarding, to finally stand on top of a mountain and say that I, in fact, climbed a mountain. 

Three years ago, when I first started thinking of this trip, I was beginning to fall into a year-long scrappy and disgusting fight with anorexia. During that time I wouldn't go outside, I'd have dehabilitating stomach cramps, and just walking outside in the summer was enough to tire me out. OCD, which in retrospect I showed signs of since early childhood, intensified greatly. I thought of suicide and self harm incessantly, and even put up a rope once, only to just stare at it and never use it.

I also hated the fact that my parents put any care into me. I hated that they paid for my treatment, I hated that they'd buy me clothes and food, I hated that they put any sort of financial, physical, or emotional backing into me at any way. Basically, I hated that they loved me, because I couldn't possibly love myself. 

I really began to pull out of this spiral a bit under two years ago. Changed schools, started fresh, and that helped significantly. I eventually stopped needing a therapist, started to find some passion in exercising, and bit by bit began to eat better. From my lowest point to now, my BMI went from somewhere around 14.8 to 18.8 and I went from barely being able to run a quarter mile to doing 2 miles and 5k distances for fun. Food and OCD still take up an unhealthy parts of my mind, but it isn't the dehabilitating obsessiveness it was before.

But back to the point, I'm proud of myself, that I managed to get the physical and mental endurance to do something I never thought I would've done. At that moment on top, with the sun in my eyes and the wind in my face, I finally felt like I accomplished something. 

I also came to not resent my parents' love or generosity, either. I still hate using their money and I don't think I'll ever be comfortable with it, but I don't hate them anymore. They paid for the trip. They've given me more than many people will ever get, and more than they've ever received themselves, and I appreciate it. Genuinely. All I want now is a way to pay that forward 

I know people have reached much lower lows and bounced back to much higher highs with not nearly as much help and as many safety nets as I have in my life. Some people struggle for decades with the same disorders that lay dormant in my mind. Some people have climbed Everest or run marathons. And many people have triumph or pain completely by themselves. 

I know my story here isn't particularly significant, noteworthy, or special to anyone else. But to me it is. It made me happy. It made me feel, for a moment, like all the stresses in my life, all the issues that plague my mind now, were miles below me. That moment came, and that moment passed. But I still remember it, and I'll still cherish it.",04Jul2019,1

100,"In high school I struggled with self harm and suicide and my parents knew about it and sent me to therapy to cope. It was wonderful, but I hated the way my parents treated me when they knew I was depressed. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to keep any kind of medicine in my room (my dad kept my medicine in a locked gun cabinet and I had to ask him to open it every night to take my medicine), I wasn‚Äôt allowed to shut my door (I had to keep the door cracked if I was in the bathroom too), scissors were taken out of my room, they tried taking the razor I used to shave my legs, and I wasn‚Äôt allowed in my room by myself unless I was sleeping. They also suddenly acted like they cared about what was going on in my life and suddenly started wanting to take me out places. I KNOW they were trying to help me, but I hate knowing they only acted that way because they knew I was struggling. I‚Äôd rather them treat me completely normally.

I‚Äôve thought about going back to therapy for a few months. Just to better myself and deal with some anxiety and friendship issues.

102,"So this is my life  so far  :
I am an 18 years old Indian guy ,5'3, and a  little overweight. I went to an all boys school and i used to have evening tuition classes for various subjects(mixed gender). I have loving parents - both of them are working . I am quite shy and i never take risks or do anything that would be out of my comfort zone . I am a procrastinator and i always waste my time instead of being productive . 
I had a bunch of friends in school, and i used to have fun in school. I did not have any friends living nearby so i spent most of my time watching tv and playing games. And school ended about 3 months ago so I'm pretty much alone all the time now and i don't go out of my house anymore. I have 2 close  friends and they have a lot of other friends and they don't hang out with me anymore.  I have no female friends and i have had very little female interaction in my life, even in my tuition classes i was always scared of being rejected by  girls and i fail to even start  a conversation. And i was also not good at my academics so i  have   burdened my parents for my further education which would cost them a lot ( we are a middle class or lower middle class family and  every private college demands a lot of money). So I'm mostly all alone all day playing game, watching movies or porn. My only strength is my drawing skill (copying from a reference) but that too has no real value because I'm unable to create art from my imagination. I have trouble approaching people and starting a conversation because i always think that I'm  being annoying and the other person wouldn't like it.

107,"I figured out I was bisexual around 18 months ago and my entire family is a part of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons). I recently, in a bid to keep myself in the closet, went on a service mission to Brazil for the church despite having major doubts about it all. I kept these thoughts in my journal. However, my first missionary companion (ie roommate) stole and read my journal and then used this knowledge to take sexual advantage of me (he was bi as well) for around 4 months. When we finally got split up, the worthiness culture of the mission got to me and I had a mental breakdown and confessed everything and had to get sent home early and put on 8 months of formal probation in my church. I came out to my family and they promised to love and support me no matter what, but it's very clear that they want me to stay in the church.

I thought maybe after all of this I could have made up my mind on whether to stay in a church that thinks homosexual thoughts/activities are a sin vs. going off on my own and living my own life, but I still can't decide. I stay up at night thinking and writing about it and weighing my options and deep down I really want to leave the church but I know that staying would be so much easier, especially for my family. I don't want to hurt them, but seeing cute guys/girls and immediately feeling a pang of shame for it every time is not a feeling I can live with.

111,"So, this is a throwaway account and I've never posted before but I've been carrying a lot on my chest for years and there's been no one to listen, if not help. So here goes:

I grew up with an emotionally (and sometimes physically) abusive single mother. Father was out of the picture before I even knew him, but considering how my mom is, I'm sure he had his reasons. I lived with solely my mom's side of the family, mostly raised by them while she was always working as a nurse. She was overprotective and controlling and used emotional blackmail alot, demonstrating all the classic signs of what I later realized to be Bipolar Disorder. We all lived under the same roof for a long while and she pushed everyone away, but I was supposed to put up with her because I was the son. I was a straight-A student but that wasn't enough, I had to be good at everything or she would find a reason why I was ""letting her down."" The rest of the family didn't really see anything wrong with what she did, since we are of an Asian culture and it was considered the norm. 

When she and they had pushed me far enough for me to break into crippling major depression by high school, at first they didn't even take it seriously. They denied I had depression; how could I be depressed? I was too young, etc. Then I got into college and the depression became worse. My uncles and aunts had children and I was supposed to be the perfect role model for them but I kept fucking up in their eyes so they ended up using me as an example of what not to be. Meanwhile, my mother would just rip me apart in front of people, if I dared to have friends over. Ex: ""oh you have a plan for what to do with your life? That's good. My son is incapable of planning anything,"" etc.

What really infuriated me was when my uncle and aunts kids started showing signs of depression, they were taken seriously, because I was the guinea pig and it was okay to let me wallow in something they denied existed but God forbid anything happen to their kids.

Suddenly, mom was okay making me see a therapist and no matter how many of them I saw, it was always an hour of pretending to listen a week plus popping pills (none of which ever worked) everyday.

After years of this and retail jobs, I was finally convinced to go to a trade school and now have a decent hospital job that pays well. Moved states away from my toxic family. Yet I just feel so broken, like I can't be normal. 

I've never had a relationship of any kind. My friends are few and far between and no matter what I do I always end up alone. I've been alone so long that I don't know how to be anything else and working on myself has yeilded nothing for so long that I can't even build a modicum of motivation for anything anymore. I've had a midlife crisis since I was 18, nothing I enjoyed makes life feel worth it anymore.

I've tried Tinder, and OK Cupid and Bumble. 90% of the handful of matches don't respond, and those that do don't lead anywhere to the point where I'm now convinced I'm hideous and will always be alone and taken for granted.

I don't have any hobbies I like that would allow for socializing, I don't like the club scene because I shouldn't have to risk hearing damage and overpay for drinks to have a half-assed conversation with someone uninterested.

After how I was raised, I absolutely don't want to raise any children and had surgery to make sure that it won't happen.

There's so much more... I can't sum up 33 years of so much effort that lead nowhere. I can't find enough words to express how utterly lost and hopeless I feel and how much it pains me to have to hide it because no one cares. Therapy has not ever helped. I am so tired of everything. It's all pointless.

TL;DR: grew up with a toxic mother and family, got a decent job and moved away from them, but life's still shotty cuz I'm a broken 33 y/o who's never had a relationship and doesn't have any nearby close friends. And I've lost all hope that life will improve.",04Jul2019,1

Nobody knew who i was because I switched schools and i felt too ugly to even hang out with people or do group work.

116,"Several years ago, I went to liquor store with my last five bucks to buy beer, hoping that would help me get at least a tiny bit of sleep because I didn't have any more money for opiates and was going to be withdrawing until I got paid. I had payday loans out all over town, pretty much everything pawnable had been pawned, and I was close to rock bottom. 

At the checkout I ran into a friend of a friend who we'll call Scooter. He said he was having a couple people over for dinner and invited me. I went and drank my beer and one or two of his, and smoked a bowl (didn't get drunk, but it was enough to keep me from completely going itchy and scratchy for the evening). We ate roast beef, talked about the future, laughed, listened to music and just had a normal, relaxed evening with friendly people. 

And on the walk home I was kind of take aback at how nice it was and how much I was missing out on due to my little solitary ""go home and get high alone then pass out"" existence. I got clean not long after with some help from our town's awesome addiction services doctor. But I've never really gotten a good opportunity to tell that guy what a difference he made for me.

&amp;#x200B;

 I am not sure if I am asking for advice, but let's suppose I am, even though I mainly want to share things with people I don't know personally and people who don't personally know me. All things considered, that should make things considerably easier. I will tell you things about me, both good and bad, and whatever happens, happens.

&amp;#x200B;

 As I am sitting here, listening to ""Wasted years"" by Iron Maiden, I am conveniently thinking about mine. I am almost 28. I will be getting there in September. A ten-year anniversary, right?

&amp;#x200B;

 I am from Serbia, but I live somewhere else. I fell into depression almost 10 years ago, I dropped out of high school largely due to it, even though everyone around me, and my mother in particular, always believed that I was just being lazy, selfish and addicted to whatever was convenient at the time. I remember the things that were going through my mind at the time, because I made a collection of writings, and I find them appalling.  My belief system was particularly awful, and, despite the perhaps undue compassion I am showing myself constantly, given my condition back then, I still dislike myself for it. I saw no value in life, I saw no point in trying anything or doing anything, and that's how it went. As I said, I am pushing 28. I never graduated from high school, I never went to university despite the countless chances I had even without having the HS diploma. I've worked a total of about a year and a bunch of months in an isolated place, where nobody could see me nor interact with me, and I liked it that way. I quit the moment I was forced into working with people, even though they were perfectly nice people. I lucked out in having a bunch of properties and items, which I could sell, and that gave me a lot of money, and that's what I have been using to live with. I don't have a lavish lifestyle by any means, and it will last me a long time, probably until my late 40s if I keep living this way. But I want to do something with my life though, reddit. I don't want to be like this. I don't want to get through my better years being this. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I am functionally fat. I am 185cm high and I weigh 130kg. I can easily run and move around, but I just won't, because I am used to staying home and doing nothing. I eat a lot of garbage even though I realize I should not. I am hearing my heart pounding extremely hard sometimes, especially during the night, and that worries me, but not enough apparently. I know I need to lose weight and I did once. I lost 30kg in about a month, and that's one of my biggest health-related achievements, despite the fact that it didn't last, of course. I used to be very sportsy in my early years. I simply don't know what happened to that passion of mine. I am fluent in 5 languages, I have never smoked, used drugs or drank alcohol, I have been told by countless people that I am apparently very intelligent, and I believe I can easily get into university, but I just won't. I don't know what it is, and I don't know why it is, but there is something that's pushing me towards being \*\*\*this\*\*\*. I imagine it has to do with what I went through earlier in my life, but I don't ""feel"" it anymore. I don't know why I am wired to be like this, and I cannot figure it out. I want to do the things I want to do, but I cannot. I want to read the things I want to read, but I cannot. I want to be the way I want to be, but I cannot. I cannot force myself to change. There is something inside that draws me towards this state of being. Lifeless, fat and useless. And it seems to be just me. I have had different people who don't know me act super friendly towards me, be genuinely curious about who I am, and genuinely appear to like me. I don't believe they saw any of the things I feel about me, and I don't believe that I gave the same impression I have about myself to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

And so I don't know how to snap out of it, and that scares me. A lot. Sometimes I feel like I cannot achieve anything in life while I feel this way, and that, I think, makes me unable to push for anything. Somehow, there's a pattern in my behaviour that is embedded into my brain, and it makes me do these things that I dislike and I don't want to keep doing. I don't even think I need to avoid people anymore, reddit, but I do anyway. Again, I don't know how to snap out of it. I really don't. I am lonely, I have about zero friends, and I haven't been laid in almost three years. I don't work at the moment, and I don't study, and I don't know how to start changing my life, which I dislike quite a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, I wanted to share that with someone, and as I am ending it, it makes me feel a bit better.

123,"Hello,

**TL;DR:** Social anxiety. Started working at a little restaurant. Afraid everyone hates me. Big, scary Chinese guy snapped at me for being an idiot.

I'm a twenty-three year old guy with pretty bad social anxiety, and I just started working at a restaurant to help me get over it. It's a small restaurant owned by a friend of my mother's. It's not too busy, so it's easier on me than a larger restaurant would be. I'm glad that I'm pushing myself to do this, but I have to admit: It's been kind of hard on me.

There's a guy working there who's around my age. I managed to hold a couple short, awkward conversations with him and found out that we have some things in common. We're both kind of shy and introverted (or at least he gives that impression); we're both starting college soon (different colleges), first taking online courses then going to actual classes; we both like similar video games‚Äîstuff like that. It seemed to be going okay, but then his shift was over, which kind of caught me by surprise, and I fumbled the farewell. He came to me and said he was leaving and he hoped to meet me again, and all I said was, ""Oh."" The next time he came in, he asked me how I was doing. I said I was fine, and that was that. Maybe he would have talked more, but he was busy at the time.

There's also a young woman who works there. She's very talkative and seems quite nice. She makes remarks about everything, asks me questions about myself, tells me about her family, and shows me pictures of her little nephew. My responses are subpar, mainly just smiling and nodding. I get the feeling that she's starting to think I'm not interested in anything she has to say.

Then there's an older guy‚Äînot that old, just older than the rest, I think. He's really nice and a little awkward. We don't have a lot in common, but we've talked a bit and seem to get along.

And there's a girl there. I think she's a bit younger than me. I only saw her once or twice. The first time I met her, the other girl introduced me. All I did was look at her briefly and say, ""hello,"" then turn away. I'm nervous around everyone, but girls around my age make me a little bit more nervous.

I try to help out as much as I can, doing everything everyone tells me to do. I've set and cleaned tables, filled condiment bottles, and made probably hundreds of condiment packages. I've also gotten some drinks for customers. I just feel like I've done so little. I feel like I'm just getting in everyone's way. All the other employees actually do something useful, like make deliveries, which I can't do because I can't drive. I can't even seat customers or take a phone call yet. I've only been there for two days, but it seems like I should do better than this. At least I'm not getting paid. I'd feel really bad if I got paid.

And then there was ""The Incident"". There are two large, scary Chinese guys in the kitchen. Once, I cleaned a table and brought the dirty dishes into the kitchen to the sink where we put all the dirty dishes. It was really full, and I didn't have anywhere to put the dishes I was holding, so I just stood there like an idiot. One of the Chinese guys was standing there watching me, then he got impatient, took the dishes from me, threw them into the sink, and shooed me away angrily. I just wanted to cry after that, and it made me feel really, really useless.

I don't know. Should I keep coming in to work and power through it, or is this just too much for me? Life has been stressful lately, so I don't know if I can handle it.",04Jul2019,3
124,"I've never thought that at the age of 25 that I would be working a full time job and still be pretty much alive. I thought I would be dead at 18.

Now that I have a second chance at life, I've been restless and hungry for more. I've always told myself that I'm destined for something more. I am highly ambitious and always seeking for success somewhere.

The only downfall is that I'm struggling with my mental illness. Mainly my borderline personality disorder. I don't have a identity since it changes everyday or every week. I might be punk one day then I might be super girly the next. When I'm depressed which I'm starting to admit that it's all the time, I don't have any motivation nor the drive to do anything. When I'm angry, I am seeing red and I am yelling a lot. Then within a span of an hour, I'm back to my bubbly cheerful self. My emotions are the eye of the storm that goes on in my head.

The decisions I'm facing right now is going back to school full time and maybe work part time. Only cause I really want to work on my recovery and getting better. I want to have stability in my life and it will make my relationships with my fiance and my family much stronger. I also don't like working for pennies even though I've only been working at the job for six months. Yet, I know I can do better with a degree.

I don't know how I'm going to fare in the world like this. My friends often abandon me or sometimes I get frustrated with them and cut them off.

127,"I recently seen an old post on r/AskReddit about the worst parts about being a man. A handful of the responses were about how no one really cares about your feelings sometimes. How you‚Äôre expected to be this emotionless blob and deal with it. Societal expectations, etc, etc. Of course I‚Äôll never fully understand what guys go through since I‚Äôm a girl. But after some thinking it made me realize that it‚Äôs kinda how I feel with my mom and dealing with her over the years. 

My mother was raised in America‚Äôs foster care system. She had a few foster families that were quite strict and mean.  She has never neglected or abused me. And has done a better job than many moms. But her growing up with this I would say it has influenced her parenting strategies. I remember whenever I was crying and/or upset she would tell me to suck it up. That crying is a sign of weakness. Crying won‚Äôt fix anything. I suppose one could argue that it‚Äôs ‚Äútough love‚Äù but all it did was shut me down. Made me not wanna show my emotions at all. Made me want to wait till I got home to go in my bedroom and lock the door. Or at least have an excuse to use the bathroom if we were out somewhere to go cry. 

At one point in my life I‚Äôve had depression. I desperately wanted therapy, any sort of therapy at that point. Someone to just talk to and understand. I knew I couldn‚Äôt talk to my mother. One day I get the courage to ask her about it and you know what I am told? Deal with it. People get sad all the time so just deal with it. I‚Äôve never had my feelings and my mental health issues feel so invalidated unlike that moment.  

I‚Äôve never truly realized how much we expect men to be ‚Äúmanly‚Äù. To be strong and stone cold. If you feel like crying you are seen as being wimpy or something. It makes me feel bad that you can‚Äôt just be yourself. That you can‚Äôt like getting massages and/or mani-pedi‚Äôs without being seen as gay. That you have to like manly activities, know how to fix cars and stuff. It makes me sympathetic and wanna just hug any guy (or anyone really) going through a tough time and remind them they are cared about.",04Jul2019,90
128,"Little backstory. I met this girl a few months ago. She was short, had a bit of a temper, but mentioned she liked memes. Now I really don‚Äôt ever meet girls that say that, and I‚Äôm not sure if my thot radar was off or something, but I ended up asking her out a few weeks later...

Then when the date came close, I got a bad feeling about it and made up an excuse to postpone it.

*that was three months ago*

Flash forward to two weeks ago, when I had the worst (or at least most awkward date) ever. She had been messaging me inconsistently throughout that whole time, sending me ‚Äúmemes‚Äù and such. Then she pulled a bomb by asking me out. Ok cool, never happened to me before...

Being the broke boi I am, I thought id take her on a walk through downtown, then to one of the mall food courts (so romantic, I know). It seemed great the first little while: walking through the city, taking transit, seeing the sights, exploring places I‚Äôd never been...

Then after an hour and a half she finally decided to show up. Apparently she not only didn‚Äôt plan a bus route properly, she got a nose bleed at the last minute (an anime joke was made by me). The first few minutes were great, we were actually talking... but the whole time she wasn‚Äôt really interested in me. Now I don‚Äôt go on many dates, but I think both parties are supposed to TALK and ask questions pretty equally. Not this girl though. She spent 25 minutes in a book store ignoring me, though I‚Äôm at least glad she found what she was looking to purchase...

After we finally got to the food court after half an hour of me essentially just following her and she was loligaging around... we sat down, it was nice, there was some conversation, for about five minutes. That‚Äôs when, she pretty fairly said... ‚ÄúI was actually going to tell you I wasn‚Äôt interested anymore.‚Äù
 One: I wasn‚Äôt actively showing any interest in her after THREE MONTHS, so I‚Äôm sure why she would think that. Two: she was the one that asked me out (and before you say it, yes, she did acknowledge several times it was a date. She was wearing a fancy dress too, strangely enough)

There were so many little awkward things after that, but I offered to walk her to the train... when we got there we just stood in silence. I eventually said ‚Äúwell uh, this was... nice.‚Äù
Nothing.
Then the train arrived, gave a very effortless ‚Äúbye‚Äù and then left...

Flash to today, I‚Äôm pretty awkward when it comes to any kind of confrontation. But she keeps messaging me occasionally just sending me... these horrible memes. Sometimes ‚Äúcute‚Äù animal videos. I don‚Äôt like either. All memes sent to me must be fresh and I honestly don‚Äôt find what most people find cute, cute.

So I don‚Äôt know what to do, do I just ghost her until she gets the message? Does she think I‚Äôm still interested and just sending me pity updates? Or worse, does she think that date was good and assume we are dating or something ._.",04Jul2019,0
129,"I live with a few people in a tiny house, and today they decided to hold a party for the 4th.  They've been planning this for a few weeks now, and I've been excited about it all the while.  It's an ensemble of close friends and family members, so it wasn't planned to be anything crazy; just a few people who care about each other playing games and catching up.   

&amp;#x200B;

About two days ago, I came home with a suddenly congested chest, throbbing head, and running nose.  I've been waking up fatigued and shaky, and I've had to take off from work.  Today, I decided to quarantine myself in my room, mostly because A. I would hate to sneeze on all the food and/or get others sick and B. no one would want to talk to someone with a nasty cough anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

I can hear everyone outside my door.  They're laughing, sharing stories, and eating good homemade food together.   It makes me feel so alone.  

&amp;#x200B;

The egocentric part of me had a nasty realization: that my friends can have so much fun without me being around.  No one misses me.  No one is concerned that I'm sequestered in my room.  I don't add anything to my community of friends.  In fact, when I stepped out to get some medicine, the few people who saw me looked a bit confused.  No greetings, no hellos, no *how are yous?* \- I just kind of slithered my way to the kitchen while they looked away.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty sure one person at least one person has noticed I'm gone, and they are probably glad about it.  One of my housemates used to be my roommate (and friend), and the way we split up was not pleasant.  Even before we decided to split rooms, she stopped speaking to me and began to ignore me if I asked her questions.  She told me to stop greeting her, and would seem disgusted if I asked how she was doing.  Now that were in separate rooms, she won't even look in my direction.  But I hear her outside my door, laughing and having a good time with our mutual friends.  

   

I know I'm being selfish.  It's good that they're all having a good time.  It should make me happy to hear my friends laughing their heads off.   It's not about me.  I know I'm not important, and no one is obligated to care.  But I just wish someone would.",04Jul2019,1

136,"I don't understand the point of going to see a therapist. For years I've been googling phrases like ""tired of living"", ""don't want to wake up anymore"", ""want to die but can't kill myself"", unknowingly re-reading the same depressing archived posts from reddit that would show up. Most of the posts are from r/depression but quite a few came from this sub, hence this post. I'm just so friggin lost and I'm afraid I'm going to do something stupid soon.  

My boredom with life has reached a fever pitch and I don't know where to go from here. What could a therapist say that I haven't heard a million times before? I feel like I know what life has to offer and I'm simply not interested in any of it. I don't want to be part of society or anything really, just want to be gone and I don't know how to manage this feeling anymore.  

From what I understand about therapy, there's talking and then suggestions on how to move forward, actions one could take etc etc, but I don't want to try anything. To what end? I think it'd be neat to have a wife and kids one day, proper job and place to live, but I feel like I have nothing to offer beyond being a breadwinner. I know I could push myself forward to get a better job, a career even, but all that conversation to build up a relationship with another person, I can't do it. I'm a boring minimalist with an overly simplistic view on life; the few things I'm interested in talking about I just go to reddit for. I laugh the hardest and smile the widest when I'm browsing around various comment sections, taking in the pop culture references and inside jokes. I have tons of family that want the best for me, some really good friends, colleagues that love me, but I feel nothing but void for people, unless it's a post on reddit.  

I've had girlfriends for long periods of time and don't have trouble talking when people engage me (I'm a tiny bit charming), but I've lost the *will* to converse. Even getting through this post is a struggle and causing me to pull out my hair because I hate being so serious and going on and on about things (I'd rather smoke and forget it). I think that's the crux of my issue, the fact that I'm so flippant about life. I don't take much seriously, and when I am serious it often seems like I'm joking with how outlandish I can be (example: I think politicians should be executed for ruining economies and generally doing a bad job). Despite my ability to fake it through most conversations, I'm severely anxious in social settings, don't possess any self-esteem, have a psychological addiction to weed and I'm fairly amoral.  

I don't know what to do with myself, I really don't. I don't want to be anywhere doing anything; I genuinely wish my parents never met. What do I do? How can I move forward when all I want to do is lay down forever? I can't stand waking up everyday and having to feed myself and keep myself entertained. This is so lame, I don't know what I'm doing.

 I'm 30 yo female and the other day I think I got turned on or maybe just emotionally overwhelmed when I was comforting my friend at work (a female too)  who was having problems with her abusive husband .

She was sobbing so hard that she felt faint and dizzy  and was barely able to stand after her crying spell was over, 
I never seen her so vuln√©rable and hurt like this before and it actually broke my heart 

 So when I was sitting next to her trying to calm her down while she sobbed uncontrollably I had this sudden surge oF protectiveness come over me and I just wanted to hug her and take her hands in mine and tell her it's gonna be ok, 
and when I saw her the next day I still wanted to hug her but she said she was feeling much better.
so I'm really confused right now because I'm not sure why I was so deeply moved by seeing her like that , and as a straight woman I'm kind scared  of how much affection I felt at that moment.

For the last few months I've been working at a company that takes the overflow from the VA and helps find doctors who will give veterans benefits exams. Sometimes, these exams need to be done before the vet dies so the family can get benefits. I like what the company is doing so much I took a pay cut to work here. For better or worse, for good reason or bad, these people put themselves in harms and got hurt. 

Myself and the people I work with have to beg, bribe, and badger doctors to do these exams. They are literally one time examinations with no treatment or follow up required.

Every day it's the same few excuses:

* They aren't taking new patients
* They don't pay enough
* They don't have time
* There is too much paperwork
* They just don't want to do it
* Can't someone else do it?
* We don't do that

Did I mention it's a one time exam?

Sometimes what makes it even worse is there is no other doctor for 50-100 miles; so we just have to keep calling the same doctor over and over again. 

My department loses money hand over fist for the company. But they at least put their money where their mouth is and are trying to do something for the vets. 

Everyone says they support the troops. They put magnets on their cars. They say, ""Thank you for your service."" anytime they find out. 

But a couple of hours of inconvenience? Working for a little less money than they could? 

OH! Fuck that. Who cares if this kid is 25 and will have to live fucked up for the next 40 or 50 years. Who gives a shit if this guy is 85 years old and has been fucked since the Korean war. Who cares. ""I'm busy. I'm important. I put a flag out on the 4th to celebrate. I'm patriotic. ""

""I Am A Good American! And I refuse to see any proof that shows otherwise.""

I get so mad listening to their bullshit and I just want to scream at them and call them out.

I‚Äôve just split up with my best friend in the whole world, the man I thought I would marry, the plan I‚Äôd planned to spend my life with. I broke up with him after a long time of trying to work on keeping our relationship loving and happy and fun, and feeling like the only one who was really trying, and it was the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done. I desperately didn‚Äôt want to do it at all but I knew it needed to happen. But we said we‚Äôd stay friends. I made a stupid mistake about a week afterwards, I‚Äôm ashamed to say what it was, but he has now said we can never be friends. And my heart is completely broken. 

I can‚Äôt stop crying, I can‚Äôt eat, I can‚Äôt sleep, I just feel empty and I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôm falling back into my depression. I‚Äôve been having anxiety attacks and I‚Äôm struggling to even get the words out to talk to anyone. 

He gave me a week to move out, and I‚Äôm signing a contract tomorrow for a flat that I can barely afford. We have to have the chat about who gets to keep what furniture and I don‚Äôt think I can even handle it. I also got some bad news from work which means I have less shifts, so I‚Äôm scared about money. And I‚Äôm scared to be alone. And I‚Äôm so heartbroken that I‚Äôve lost my best friend forever. 

This self-harm relapse has terrified me because it really becomes a desperate act and it brought me right back to the image of my severely depressed teenage self.

I would like your help so I may make new friends.

I‚Äôm deaf. Rather, I possess a severe hearing loss. I‚Äôve received two Cochlear Implants to help me ‚Äòhear‚Äô, except they were only able to partially implant the device - less than half of the electrodes the typical implanted person receives. My cochlea are simply too malformed.

Distinguishing sounds are difficult. I can‚Äôt hear the difference between ‚Äòb‚Äô and ‚Äòd‚Äô, for example, but in ideal situations I can hear the difference between ‚Äòb‚Äô and ‚Äôt‚Äô. I‚Äôm able to categorize sounds by hard or soft consonant, short or drawn out, and similar in order to narrow down the possibilities. This is further aided by lipreading. I‚Äôve gotten quite skilled at using context to ‚Äòfill in the blanks‚Äô. Even then, most of the time I'm in the dark - background noise, person looking away, topic chances, and more make it really easy for me to lose track. And once I‚Äôve lost track? It‚Äôs hard for me to get back on.

I was raised to speak and ‚Äòlisten‚Äô. I had roughly eighteen years of speech therapy. I was sent to hearing schools from kindergarten til I graduated High School. I relied on microphones and transcriptioning to understand the teacher. I was a high GPA student taking AP classes. I‚Äôve even gone on to obtain Masters of Science.

This sounds like a success story. For me, it isn‚Äôt. Of course I can read and learn subjects. It‚Äôs really easy to if there‚Äôs not much else one can do. But I consider my deafness a social disability more than anything else.

People tend to talk in groups. People tend to be where there‚Äôs noise. People tend to cover their mouths or similar. I can‚Äôt understand people in casual situations. Very rarely is someone alone, in a silent area, and willing to talk. I ‚Äòneed‚Äô this circumstance in order to adjust to a person‚Äôs speaking style and learn their voice and habits.

And even if such a circumstance occurs, there‚Äôs a low chance we‚Äôll become friends. After all, if you pick one random person to talk to - what are the chances you‚Äôll become friends?

I have to ask people to repeat what they say, especially when I‚Äôm still adjusting to their speech. This can be annoying. It‚Äôs easier to talk to almost anyone else. Especially their friends. The times that I do have a casual conversation with someone twice actually tend to shock me - who would come back to having a frustrating conversation?

I know first impressions make a big difference. My initial conversations tend to make a poor first impression - especially as I can‚Äôt generally convey my passions or views in the ten minutes I‚Äôm still trying to learn someone‚Äôs name and what they do. Sometimes, I just smile and nod. By then, generally they have somewhere else to be.

And I‚Äôm left there, happy that someone at least tried.But I feel alone.

I suspect that I lack social tact. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised - I did miss out on most social development due to my social isolation. In my free time, I generally read books or similar. This probably made me even more unapproachable (although even when I didn‚Äôt, I wasn‚Äôt approached much. It gets boring sitting around). I might need to learn how to hold a conversation and be funny or interesting.I‚Äôve been to clubs and gaming groups. I‚Äôve tried really hard to insert myself into social situations. They just tend to be so noisy that I can‚Äôt understand. Everyone‚Äôs talking in groups with constant interruptions and topic changes and by the time I find who‚Äôs speaking they‚Äôre about finished. Not that it would have mattered - it‚Äôs hard enough understanding someone alone.

I‚Äôve become passive. I stopped trying. I‚Äôm depressed. I‚Äôm lonely.

I have so many things I want to share. My childhood love of Harry Potter and the new released game of Wizards Unite. My political beliefs (I have a BA in Political Science). My cats.

And I want to hear what other people get passionate about too.

I‚Äôm starved for conversation. I‚Äôm starved for friendship. I yearn for a single touch from someone. I want a hug, but a simple handshake will do.

I want this to change. So I‚Äôd love your help.

How can I get better at making friends?",04Jul2019,3

A Severe Battle With Severe Sadness 6

There came a point where I realized who I really was. This was a recent event. I was contemplating in the car why my life was the way it is; no friends, no social life, no relationships, underachiever, discontent, no structure, backwards life, and so on. So I thought about my actions, my dialogues, what my personality is like, who I am as a person. This is when I realized who I truly am. Cold, arrogant, rude, awkward, gross, mean, self-serving, angry, reticent, cynical. I recalled many instances of letting people down, destroying any friendship, and being unwilling to communicate. Quick to resent, slow to communicate, quick to hate, slow to love, quick to ignore, slow to respond, quick to hide, slow to show. And this has been the case for a long time. Since elementary school, since my family moved to the United States, since my parents divorced, since my brothers and I split up, since I was able to point my eyes in front of me and see life for what it is.

I'm a bad person. Laying that fundamental fact out and understanding it is crucial to any healing or self-improvement. I *AM* a bad person, as of the present. I hope I am able to change my ways, build strong friendships, be somebody that is pleasant to be around, be somebody that helps others before self-helping, be somebody that is there and sturdy and strong.

That is a long road with many wrong turns. I hope I make it to the end. I might not.",04Jul2019,1

They don‚Äôt let me do anything, even swearing is an extremely sinful and wicked thing to do. My mom was absolutely devastated when I admitted that I swear sometimes. She would probably get a heart attack if she found out I watch porn. So as a result of this I‚Äôm forced to live a double life, and I‚Äôm just unable to do this anymore I‚Äôm depressed, and very anxious. I really need help, please.",04Jul2019,2

163,"First of all I want to make it clear that I'm not sure if I'll have to join the military or not, I'm sure I'll get some results this month but overall I have no clue. I'm a 17 year old Swedish male and will turn 18 this October. If you didn't know, in Sweden a lot of people are forced to do military training and potentially being called when a crisis arises to fight for the country. Not only did the letters and news I got about this irritate me due to it being overly patriotic and obvious propaganda (""fight for your country"" like I'm gonna be willing to murder people due to leaders selfish reasons), but I have a bunch of reasons I don't want to join. 

First of all, I haven't had a proper life. Growing up my parents were poor so we weren't ever able to go anywhere (even my older brother told me I grew up poor, as his dad could afford more when raising him and my other siblings (we don't share the same dad)), a lot of people bullied me, and I had to live with a schitzophrenic mother since I was 4 and a father that considered his girlfriends dog more important than me (he literally said so), not even cooking me proper food but essentially forcing me to survive on sandwiches. Eventually when I was about 14 or so I had no friends, and have had only online friends since then, and moved to a foster home with actual mentally healthy people in 2017 in which I now live. I've had to fight fears like talking to people, improved my grades, etc etc since then, and would love to get a girlfriend- for which I also need to conquer my fears. I think it would be very unfair to be forced into something very brutal when I haven't even had a chance to fully recover my mental health and experience life. 

Second of all- and this one I can't forgive even if it seems small- I study Japanese. I've been studying Japanese ever since I moved to my foster home every day, and if I keep going I could potentially be pretty gosh darn good at it by 2021 or 2022. Most of my online friends are Japanese or Asian, and I'm planning on going to Japan next year- right when (if forced to join the military) my military training would begin. I'd have to not-study Japanese for a while and my Japanese would get worse and worse and I'd have to catch up on so much progress! I could spend all that time studying Japanese but no! It may seem small but it's a huge goal for me and it's something I wanna succeed in doing, please understand. 

I keep thinking of ways to somehow escape it. If I was a cute girl- maybe I could marry some fat foreigner and get a divorce. It would be cruel, yes, but it'd be a possibility- but of course it's impossible to be a cute girl when you're a boy. 

Or maybe I could just vanish somewhere, wander through the woods until I reach some other country and illegally migrate there- it would be an adventure, but at the same time I wouldn't be able to study Japanese.

Or how about filing a law suit delaying it for two years or so promising to do the training once I'm done with studying Japanese, then breaking said promise by moving to Japan- or any country really- within those two years- I wonder if that's even feasible....

... Maybe I could marry a huge lady in America and immediately break up... (just kidding, I'm not that terrible, maybe). 

I'm gonna have to wait and see if I'm forced to do it or not, but if there is a god and I'm forced to do it I'll point a middle finger to the sky. Heck I'm even considering faking all the physical and psychological tests, I'd do almost anything to get out of this predicament!

And before anyone says ""Oh please do it to serve your country"" or ""don't run away from your problems"" or whatever, I'm not willing to kill people to protect a country I don't even have any emotional connections to, haven't had a good life in, nor am I willing to go through military training if I'm gonna move to another country anyway. War is never honorable, so don't talk me into just doing what I'm told- that's all I'm good at anyway.   


I had to get that out of my system, thank you.",04Jul2019,1
164,"  I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven‚Äôt talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  üëî  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‚Äòyou make me sweat, Graham‚Äô and I said ‚Äòwhat?‚Äô then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‚Äòwtf‚Äô she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt got a boyfriend you know, Graham‚Äô I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",04Jul2019,1
165,"Fuck em. This IS you, as you change.  The acceptance allows the awareness which will inevitably focus on truth which will inevitably give rise to change.

166,"Alcoholism is very common in my family and had honestly torn it apart. My mother is an alcoholic and she refuses to admit it and it was a contributing factor in her divorce from my dad and the main reason why I don‚Äôt talk to her anymore. It caused a lot of trauma for our family. On my dads side, multiple people are alcoholics.

There was a time where I never wanted to drink, but I realized I was just scared of becoming like my mother. I wanted to be able to drink healthily like how my father does. Maybe have wine or beer with a friend and maybe let yourself drink more at a party. I am currently in college so it was easy at the party scene.

I still rarely drink, but recently I was thinking about trying to have a glass of wine with dinner. Not every day, but maybe once a week. 

I‚Äôve tried twice so far and I can‚Äôt even get through a few sips. I find myself feeling that fear again, it makes me upset at myself for trying to drink alone. I usually just pour the wine down the sink.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll keep trying, but I thought that fear I originally had was gone but it seems I‚Äôm still just as terrified as I was before.",04Jul2019,2

Hello Reddit! I'm on mobile so forgive me for all the mobile shenanigans+formatting apparently! I'm also a little bit drunk but we should be fine going forward!

Let me just start this of with a ""hey reddit! How's it going?""

Now, onto the not-so-deep shit!

Now, I wasn't sure whether to post this to r/datingadvice or something like that but given that X person and I have never dated then I think it's not apt.

Anyways, let's get to that bread and butter!
So I am a 23 y/o Male living in the UK. Just an average dude. Nothing special really. I have an interest in a 21 y/o female, that I will call ""X"", this interest has gone on for more than a year. I've tried and I've failed seemingly. But this is the point of the post. She's probably been with 6 or 7 dudes within the year, not counting one night stands, power to her, I don't care.

Now what I do care about is, I'm seemingly no different from many of these dudes. X boasts about learning a new thing with one of them (well I could have taught X that and X knows it), except  I cross the board with all of them apart from language learning. I fucking suck at languages, but this is just the newest thing. So let's call it 6/7 things I could have taught to X and yet I'm still not even within the frame. 

We've talked about looks and all that jazz even, hell I've had a few breakdowns about how lonely I can feel. X says theres ""nothing wrong with me"" but if that's the case then why not date me at least? But there's no real answer to that other than ""I just don't see it"". Which is all well and good, just incredibly frustrating and makes me question myself a lot, like, if there's nothing wrong sure, but there's also nothing right with me either? That's just fucking rude man! Especially if I seemingly tick 6/7 of these boxes! 

I guess I'm just trying to get this off of my chest without telling people I know IRL. It just gets worse for me because I told X each and every time about their current SOs red flags and was blatantly ignored until it hurt X and X came to me for comfort. In that sense it feels so one sided in a friendship I'm not even sure it's worth being friends but X is so compassionate about some things it's impossible to imagine X as being selfish until I feel hurt by X's actions.

I dunno reddit but thanks for reading!
