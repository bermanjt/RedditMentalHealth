1,"Whether it's the law of the land, or faith you are threatened with punishment should you dare try leaving this world. Why?

The world runs on resources. Do I owe a debt that needs to be paid? Even as an old decrepit, bedridden being the threats still linger. Why am I not allowed to leave? What could anyone gain from an unproductive person barely living a few more weeks?

Why does everyone attempt to convince you that you shouldn't leave when you want to? Why does everyone guilt you for wanting to find freedom? Why isn't there a single place out there that says it's okay to want these things? No one lets you feel good for wanting to leave. Instead they desperately try to anchor you into their world. They'll polish up your prison. They'll open a window. But they won't help you get to the other side of that window. You have to be content with just watching. 

Because you're in prison. You're doing time. You don't know why. Maybe you are horrible. Maybe you ought to pay your debts. If you leave now you'll have to pay interest. They did you a favor by erasing what made you so horrid. You still have debts to pay. Debts you'll never want to pay. Because you don't know what you did wrong. You only know that you wish to leave. To be free. To return to zero. That which you were made from.

Reality is, you don't have any guarantee that death is the route to zero.",08Sep2019,2
2,"I am not evil in the sense of committing violence and hardships. But I have noticed that Im quite evil like a Shakespearian character. 
I had sex in places were it is not ok to have sex in, I have fooled people into blindly doing something that will benefit myself, I have played people like chess pieces, some times pinning them against each other, sometimes pinning them against something else, etc... 

And yet, I cannot help but remember those remarkable utterances by Machiavelli. “The ends justify the means”
Is what Im doing ok? Are people getting hurt? What if the end goal is perhaps a loftier and nobler thing than the means to get to it? See, even that thought itself carries a bit of poison and darkness. 

Yet isn’t it something impressive to be good with words? To be so skilled in rhetoric and deception that people can do this or that just from your words? 

I believe it was Julius Caesar who said he preferred to capture a city more by a blockade and the cutting of supplies rather than by storming the walls. 
I feel the same way. The latter is too violent, too brusque. There is something brilliant in the subtle orchestration of achieving your aims not by force but by calculation. 

Yet there is something in me that tells me that such ideas and thoughts should not be part of me.

4,"I am turning 30 in about 3 months. 3 months ago though something shifted in me. I started dieting, working out, taking better care of my skin and hair (I wasn't a complete troll to begin with though lol), flossing EVERY NIGHT, Sleeping 8 hours, deleted all my social media accounts which were very toxic, well you get the idea. I made a lot of positive changes and it was just automatic. I wasn't pushed by anyone to do it and I didn't force myself either.

I'm so much happier now and I've lost 25lbs so far. I suffer from Sever Depression and Anxiety and I'm not ""cured"" but life is looking good. I know what I want in life and what I don't . But I'm concerned it might only be temporary and that scares me because I'm finally doing some good for myself.

5,"I just started as a freshman at a very small college (less than 2k students). It’s only been about 2 weeks which I know isn’t a lot, but I haven’t made any good friends. I don’t have a roomate because he couldn’t make tuition last minute so now I have a single room. I have acquaintances I say “hi” to when I see them, but no one I could get lunch with or see a movie with. I eat most of my meals alone. It’s currently Saturday, and I’m probably going to be spending the night alone in my dorm room. I haven’t been to a single party, and the only thing I do to pass the time when I’m not in class is go to the gym. I also tried to ask 2 girls out and was rejected both times. I feel even worse because in highschool I had close good friends, was social and easily made conversation, had 3 girlfriends, and was never rejected. I know all the answers to my problem, like “join a club” “sit with strangers” “meet people in your classes”, but I can’t seem to make them work. I bought a bottle of vodka off a upperclassman and drank the entire thing in one night by myself and apparently called my ex crying and telling her I miss her then puked on my floor. Ive also found myself skipping meals because I’ve lost my appetite. I’ve never felt this alone, pitiful, and disgusting. I’m not doing well and I don’t know how to fix it.",08Sep2019,1

9,"A little background: I'm 26 and have never been with a girl before (and I post on Reddit, shocking!). When I was a teenager girls used to follow me around all the time, but I was just too goofy and unaware to really notice or care. My life took a slump in my early twenties where I pretty much stayed inside 24/7 and had no positive outlook for the future. Didn't have a job, didn't have a license or a car, didn't have a phone, piss poor hygiene, pretty much just completely isolated and miserable. I finally ended up turning my life around completely for the better a couple of years ago, just a complete 180, near miraculous, and that brings us to where we are today.

So what is it that made me both happy and sad at the same time? Well, in a conversation I had with my coworkers today it came up that I had never been with a girl before. My coworkers were completely shocked. They told me they find it hard to believe because girls come up to them ALL THE TIME and tell them they think that I'm hot and ask for my name. This completely floored me, and of course it was a giant boost of confidence as well. However, it made me sad at the same time because here I had wasted so much time over the past couple of years that could have been spent sharing amazing experiences with another human being, and all because of assumptions I had made about myself that turned out to not even be true. All this improvement, but I've still been letting my self-doubt and fear of rejection cloud my mind.",08Sep2019,8

A couple hours had passed, when I was about to say something off cuff and rather bitchy. That’s not me. I stopped myself. I said to myself,out loud, just because I’m having a bad day doesn’t mean I have to be bitter towards others. Just because my day was miserable doesn’t mean I have to make others suffer with me.

16,"I lost my job on August 19th because a company violation that is normally overlooked by every manager in the company because it helped customers. I'm not getting into that anyways...I've been separated from my ex for 2 years, I've been drowning in debt from her actions in our marriage like credit cards and non paid Bill's. Now the debt was manageable because of my job, I almost lost my home to foreclosure if one of my friends didnt take over my mortgage(I know I got lucky). But after 1 and a half years I got the debt from 30k down to 12k because of the job I had, I moved into my parents media room for cheap rent at 10 percent of my checks a month so I could pay debts and save.

I also paid my ex 400 a month to make sure my 2 kids wouldnt be screwed when they were at their moms half the time. So I'm just waiting for her too take me to court for child support saying I'm unfit or something, not sure what shell do shes a pathological liar so the skies the limit with her.

With the rent wise I was suppose to be out come Oct 1st no if ands or buts. I have no friends with a room to rent from,all of my family that can help live a minimum 3 hours away.

I got a job offer making half of what I make I start next week, but I have poor credit and no savings from trying to pay off the debt, I was suppose to sign and make the payment for the apartment the friday the week after I got the boot. 

Bankruptcy wise I cant afford my Bill's, the job I'm getting wont afford my Bill's, I have debt consolidation for the Bill's I knew about at the beginning of the separation.

Sorry if I'm all over the place, I'm stressing out really bad right now, not sure how to prevent homelessness and everything else literally feels like the world's crashing around me.

17,"Just a play on bad guy lyrics lol. 
But I’m all serious, I feel like I’m a shitty friend. I’ve recognized this about myself for years and I’m still struggling. 
For context: I’m ( 21 F) college student and never had a best friend in my whole life. I’ve had acquaintances and co workers but even these connections exhaust me. The closest I have been to a bff was my ex friend who immediately drops me whenever she gets into a relationship. Our “friendship” always felt competitive and she would constantly make jokes about things I was insecure about. Now that’s she out of my life, I feel like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. But there’s also a void? I’ve been pretty lonely since the start of the semester and haven’t meet anybody at school. It’s easy for me to meet new people but the maintenance is what gets me. I’m naturally more introverted even though I hate to accept it. I don’t want to look back in my college years and regret not being more social :(

TLDR: Basically,  I’ve acknowledged I’m a bad friend after losing my only friend and  scared of ending up eating alone at the cafeteria for the next 3 years :/",08Sep2019,1

20,"The protagonist wouldn't be particularly unique; just slightly better built than average, because he gets really into weights for a while every few months.  
Then he sees small improvements. They're significant changes, he looks pretty decent but not remarkable, however he can lift some heavy shit at work better than others. This might affect him negatively, for example others might make him do all the heavy work, or positively, for example by opening a jar for a cute girl. His interactions would be shaped as a reflection of his workouts. He'd still fuck up by saying some dump joke or something, which is why he'll often come to realize that his body isn't the only thing that matters, and he needs to work on his behavior, analyze his feelings, and relax a bit.

“I wish you hadn’t had to go. I wish that, over the summer, on my days off, I could have taken you out for ice cream, or we could’ve gone bowling, or something. I don’t even know if you like bowling.”

A sigh, a small, sad smile, then she brushes her hair behind one ear. It’s longer now than it used to be.

“I didn’t want to leave, you know. But I was sixteen, and I didn’t have a choice.”

The sky looks like the ocean today, deep and blue, and endless...

“I know. God, I know. I wouldn’t have known what to do if you’d stayed, anyway.”

“Then what was all that about ice cream and bowling?”

She’s teasing me now, that smile tells me so. But still:

“That’s just the kind of thing you’re supposed to do.”

It’s a sigh this time, a short one, instead of a smile.

“Hm. Do you still remember that question I asked you, a little while after you told me? I mean, whether you liked me or loved me?”

“I remember.”

She turns toward me a little more.

“Do you remember how you answered?”

“‘A little of both, I think. Or somewhere in the middle.’”

She’s fidgeting now. I wonder why.

“That’s right. Do you still think the same way?”

“No... I don’t think I do.”

She stops, and cocks her head to the side a little. The breeze picks up just enough that her hair untucks itself.

“What do you mean?”

“Somehow, I ended up doing some thinking. About how I felt, and why I felt that way. And I thought that... I don’t really feel that way about you. Maybe I never did. Maybe I only wanted to.”

An understanding look.

“Yeah, I get it. I think I might have felt that way too.”

There’s more to it, though, for me.

“I guess I was caught up in... something. You know, you’re supposed to find love as a teenager, so I thought I’d give it a try. But, looking back now, it isn’t really all that.”

Her next word is more like a breath as she looks down.

“Yeah... Yeah, it really isn’t.”

27,"""I wish last night would have turned out different, and my 100th was a better entry. 

I know myself - and I know I am not social when I am tired - especially at parties. I have too much on my mind, and being that outgoing in that situation is difficult for me. I wish you would have said bye to my friends, I wish I could have the heart in me to tell them bye. I am empty inside, and for whatever reason I thought going out and saying ""yes"" more often would help. But I can't fake happiness. I am trying to search as best as I can, but it seems like there is nothing that makes me permanently happy. I love being with my friends in our own group, especially one-on-one. I just don't feel loved sometimes, and I guess I have to accept that, and try to love myself. I think I can do that. I do want to be happy, and I am at times. I love that fact that I wake up everyday at 4:30 a.m., work out, and bust my ass daily to do what I can. I love the fact I look in the mirror every morning and try to see myself for who I really am, and that I meditate before getting my day started. I love the fact that I go pray and try to find something to believe in bigger than myself. I love the fact that I am disciplined enough to manage 15 hours of classes, my honors thesis, work, graduate school applications and studying for the GRE. I love the fact that I keep up with my hobbies and interests. I love the fact I am able to cook everyday and eat healthy in order to stay fit. I love the fact that I have spent so much time in college reflecting on who I am, and who I want to be. I love the fact that my friends care about me, and are excited to see me. I love the fact I have something to offer my friends, and that they see something in me. 

But there are somethings that I don't love about me. 

I don't love the fact that I still carry so much pain in my heart, even after all these years. I don't love the fact that no matter how hard I work on myself I will always see myself as someone who used to be abusive to his ex-girlfriend. I don't love the fact I will never allow myself to be loved because of how much I hate myself. I don't love the fact that I hold myself back from taking risks and chances with my love life, because I am scared I haven't changed, and that my lack of confidence won't let me believe in myself - let me believe I am worthy of love. I don't love the fact that everything I pursue and accomplish is in an effort to convince me that I am not that person anymore. I don't love the fact that I am running away from my demons. I don't love the fact the fact that I am scared of letting my friends see me broken, sad, and unwell - being vulnerable is difficult. I don't love the fact that I want them to be vulnerable around me, but I can't offer the same in return. I don't love the fact that I don't think I am strong, or courageous enough to let them in - and that I prefer to take the easy way out. I don't love the that I tell myself I am doing okay when I am not - or that I bullshit myself and push it down further. I don't love the fact that I refuse to go to anyone to talk about how I feel. I don't love the fact that I miss having someone to love me - hold me, tell me she loves me, and that I make her happy and safe. I don't love the fact that they only person I ever loved hates me because of how I treated her. I don't love the fact that I let that enable me to be cold and unavailable at times. I don't love the fact that I let that define who I am, and don't make an effort to view my self the way my loved ones view me - that I am a great, lovable, hard-working young man. I don't love the fact that there is more things I do love that things I do. But what does love got to do with it when I don't love myself?

So the question is - what can I do to love myself more? Be me? Be open with my friends, let them know I am really not doing well sometimes? Wake up everyday, and really put my heart, mind and soul in everything that I do, every day? Do the things I enjoy daily more? Be willing to fail more? Actually take the time to step back and realize how great my life really is, and how I have so much to be thankful for? Wake up with a purpose everyday and chase after my goals? Write more in my journal - about the people and things I love? Or about what I am accomplishing every day? Pray and meditate more? Be more honest with myself when I look in the mirror? I think everything I have mentioned is a part of the answer. I have to start today and start now. I do want to be happy, and I do want to love myself more. And I think I got it in me. I know myself - my boundaries, fears, strengths, capabilities, what I enjoy, how I feel. Today I have taken a long, hard look in the mirror. This is exactly what I was hoping for - what I was praying for. I can only go up from here. Even if I falter, I will come back here to remind myself of my ""why"" - because I am worthy. 

My 100th may have been horrible, but my 101st was my best ever. I have been telling myself I got to come back home...I know where it is now.""

After the entry, I wrote the lyrics to the song ""Intro"" by J. Cole. - I often jot down songs that reflect how I feel. It is a good song, I recommend you check it out.

Thank you for sticking through this - I wrote it this morning, and immediately afterwords (and lots of crying), I felt so much better and happier. My day was fantastic, and I enjoyed so much of it.

28,"I don’t know why, I mean I guess it’s resentment from things they’ve done. But even certain family members like my own mother, I can’t make myself give her the relationship that I know she wants from me. I know exactly how to act to make people feel loved and appreciated and it’s like some part of me doesn’t want to give it out. 

It’s not this way with everyone, there are some people who I love deeply and want to make sure they know I’m here for them all the time. But there are some people that I just don’t care about as much as I wish I could. It sucks, I just want to make everyone around me happy even if deeper parts of me don’t think they deserve it. 

I want to be the bigger person, that’s the right thing to do right? To be kind and thoughtful and there for people even if they’ve been selfish or acted badly towards you. Even if it’s being a pushover it’s always how I wanted to live, because it just feels good. But now even with friends who haven’t really caused “trauma” or disrespected me in significant ways, I still can’t seem to make myself care about them. It’s just like I’m not clicking with certain people and if that happens my brain just gives up and can’t continue or try to fake a connection. 

I want to figure out how to fake it, I feel like that’s the best way to keep others happy and probably a necessary tool for the future. As of right now though It seems impossible.",08Sep2019,2

What's the point? I've been depressed for years and trying to fight it but I'm starting to not think there's any point to that. Even for people who are ""happy"" life isn't good. It's like fighting through depression is just learning to somehow ignore that.

They asked me to go to room and she brought girl she was nice looking and interested but for some reason I said no

37,"This has been a constant THEME in my life. I don't get it! I don't think I'm unattractive. I do think I'm funny and fun to be with. At least, that's what my friends tell me. I don't think I'm a genius or anything but I'm smart enough to have completed my studies at a good college and I have a good job too. So I'm not dumb as soup.

I remember in college, I didn't think of myself as Miss Popular or anything. But people told me of how many guys kept asking about me. I didn't really care about that either. I had a boyfriend anyway. But what bugged me the most was that if I probed deeper into these guys inquiring about me, it was always about something physical. My first boyfriend was interested in having something physical with me and that was it. And I didn't know it. I had a friend who wanted to be fwb with me. And a couple of other guys who actually told people they do fantasize about me and yet, they don't want to DATE me. In fact, they wanted this to be like a bucket list item they wanted to cross off. And all of these guys had one thing in common (apart from being total jerks) - they all never wanted to be seen talking to me even.

It kind of makes me think like I'm a prostitute, no offence to anyone who actually is. I mean like, they all want to flirt with me, do stuff with me but they'd rather that no one know. If they think I'm such a ""catch"", then why would they want to hide me? Not that I ever did anything with these guys. My first boyfriend was someone I had an issue with regarding this because you don't hide your girlfriend. The other guys STILL had a reason to hide me, since it would only be purely physical. But I was angry that my BOYFRIEND never wanted people to know we were a thing.

It's a strange thing to be annoyed with. I mean, yes, I don't want to be linked to these kinds of guys either. But it makes me wonder why someone would say, ""She's so hot, I want to bang her"" and then, ""Oh but no one should know that we talk or anything."" That makes me wonder if there were guys I dated who felt the same way but didn't say it out of politeness.",08Sep2019,5
38,The past few weeks I’ve felt a lot more thoughtful just as a whole and I was trying to think of what purpose  we have or at least ways to live a fuller life and it kinda hit me that the idea of attaining enlightenment is a pretty valid answer i don’t necessarily agree with the (Buddhist? I hope) idea of nirvana or really an afterlife at all but that doesn’t mean having a better understanding of the world around you can’t make you a happier person,08Sep2019,2
42,"First of all, I don't even sincerely believe that I am self centred, psychopathic or a sociopath, probably because I am such a narcissist(Which also applies to me not sincerely believing in it). I don't know why I am asking this, maybe so that something might convince me to accept myself. 

I became self conscious about this when a friend confronted me about my lack of emotion. My friend had commented  about my ""literally nonexistent "" facial expression, not crying or feeling ""moved"" at all by sad movies etc, and showing very little emotion in general. I kind of went down a meta cognitive rabbit hole, and began to realise how little I might care about other people or how little I tend to sympathise with people and fictional characters. I also think that I am usually over analytic so to say.   Below are some situations that make me suspicious of myself:

* Showing no reaction whatsoever in an extremely grotesque torture scene in a movie while my friends were freaking out big time
* Finishing watching a supposedly ""sad"" movie (All of my friends cried while watching it), and commenting on cinematographic techniques used in the film, to which my friends commented that I was insensitive
* Not breaking down, showing emotion when my pet died; I like to believe that I loved my dog, but now I'm questioning it
* etc.

There are many other situations, but I'll leave it to three. In my support for example, when a friend was in a emotionally weak state, I actually talked to and listened to my friend, and did my (what I think was) my best to support my friend through it. It does show that I can care for people , but I can never really feel other people's emotions like it is mine, and I would never feel any emotion for someone else's experience. 

Since I don't really want to talk about this with my friends, I'll ask reddit:

* Anyone have similar experiences or characteristics?
* Supposedly (as a random example) your friend is telling you his/her story of being physically and emotionally abused by his/her partner. How much would you sympathise? Do you think you would experience emotion because of it?

I'm honestly not trying to get supportive comments, just an objective feedback to my situation. I can answer questions if it helps. 

Thanks in advance.",08Sep2019,1
43,"For the last 5 years, I've always felt that something was off. I've always felt like that others treated me like I was mentally disabled or retarded or autistic or some shit.

My family has never said that I was autistic or retarded or some shit. But there were so many times where I felt like others think that I am. So I'm really scared that there is something wrong with me and **NOBODY** will tell me what is wrong with me.

I'll give some examples:

1: During my 3rd year of college, my floor had a small event where we could paint on a small canvas. I was trying to make a gradient sky with stars and some shit, but it came out horribly. I (think) I heard someone used the word 'retarded' when talking about me. When I looked at the girl, she looked back and said ""that painting looks reeeeally nice :)"" but it obviously wasn't good. It felt like she was talking down to a mentally disabled person or something.

2: Last year (during my 4th year of college), I had lunch with a guy. That past weekend, I went to the first party of my life and it was horrible. I looked like an idiot wandering out there and doing nothing. I had absolutely zero social skills. Anyway, during this lunch, I remember that he said maybe I might be a bit autistic or something, and I laughed it off and he never mentioned it again. He probably thinks I don't remember this conversation, but in reality, it haunts me to my very soul. I was always scared that I might be autistic or retarded and that everyone else is just being nice to me or something, and hearing him say something like that just makes me realize that my fears might be true.

3: Today, I went to the first party of the year (I don't go to a lot of parties), and I bought a hot dog. Some girl said to me ""Oh nice, is that hotdog good?"", in which I responded, ""yeah, it's good"". She then said ""I'm really proud of your for eating good food"". WHAT THE HELL? 

OK PLEASE GUYS. NO BULLSHIT OR ANYTHING. **PLEASE.** ALL I REALLY WANT IS A DEFINITE ANSWER. IS THERE SOMETHING FUCKING WRONG WITH ME OR NOT? 

**HOOOOOOOOOOWW** CAN I FIND OUT IF THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME????",08Sep2019,6

I’m a self taught pole dancer and I just competed in my first pole dancing competition and i placed 4th out of 15 (this was the preliminary round) and the top 5 were advancing straight to finals so now i get to do that! The last time I competed in anything was cheerleading for my HS and our team was awful and we won 2nd place BY DEFAULT ( there were only two teams in our division including us) and i had to be fake proud about carrying our trophy into the school. 
but i’m not fake proud of this! i did this all on my own!

55,"Let me preface by saying my dad is an alcoholic.  He’s had 2 DUIs and his life is sort of spiraling (not paying bills, 2 divorces, losing customers for his job, etc.) out of control.

So this has all been happening while I have felt very emotionally distant from the whole thing.  I’m in my late 20s, recently got married and bought a house so I have my own priorities to handle.  

Every now and then I’ll check in on my dad just to see how he’s doing and after a phone call I usually don’t feel physically sad or emotional about the situation. Of course I’ll feel a little sad, but that feeling doesn’t last very long. As a matter of fact I usually can play it off with a joke or laugh about how bizarre life is. Not saying that laughing about it is a good or bad thing, but basically I’m saying that I never let his situation bring me down.

Anyway last night my wife and I had dinner with my mom and stepdad and a local restaurant and my mom just asked “so how do you feel about this whole thing with your dad?” 

I started off by giving my usual “I think he’ll be ok” and “he just needs to get his life back on track.”  But then I started crying and it hit me like a freight train and I couldn’t stop.  I honestly never cry and couldn’t even tell you the last time that it happened, but sure enough I was a mess. I couldn’t control it and I’d never felt anything like that in my life.  I couldn’t even speak. When I could gain my composure I even remember saying “I have no idea why this is happening.”

Later that night this eventually led to a mini argument with my wife where she said I should be more emotional if something is bothering me, but in all honesty I don’t feel like my dads alcoholism was bothering me.  Is this all subconsciously bothering me?  Is it bad to not be outwardly emotional about life happenings?  Maybe I’m suppressing some anger and sadness but I feel like if I am, I’m not aware of it.

Sorry if this is long. Just a weird thing that happened last night and needed to post about it.",08Sep2019,3
56," 

first  before I start how many of you are aware of near death experience study  like the one from raymond moody and his book called life after life,  also mysterious after effect of a near death experience like meaninful  coincidence and synchronicity and also high intuition and even psychic  event

now let me tell my story

im  a drug addict, that day i took amphetamine and didnt slept for 3 days, i  went to sleep but woke up just fine, but everything was strange  afterwards, i was feeling supernatural occurence, like the music would  sing to me about other people emotions, i felt like someone i knew had  died and the music was telling me about it, thats how i felt, i had a  partial spiritual awakening in the middle of that and at one time its  like I knew of everything about the universe and i was having psychic  event (a bit prior to my near death experience)

anyway  One day as I woke up, in my basement all sound dropped, i couldnt hear  anything its like everything had stopped, suddenly i heard through  telepathy an entity tell me i was dead and i was a ghost and to have  fun, it all happened telepathically, on shock i went back to the sofa i  had just woken up, there was a door leading outside, its then that I  heard this door open and someone enter the room, he said heres is a 3  day old corpse on the sofa, while saying my name, but this was just  normal sound, it was physical but not material, like it was happening in  a different reality, then i heard more sound, one of a woman crying, i  think it was my mom finding my body and another of  a women scared of  her wits, i could feel her walking around in the room, and it was messy

traumatized  at this point, i went to the computer to try to gather my sense, i  remember clicking on a video on youtube trying to get back to reality, i  then went crosside and checkec through the windows, its was very cloudy  and foggy, its then that i saw a light, kinda blueish, i can only  describe as pure light, it illuminated my face but it wasnt blinding, it  came from where the sun was but it wasnt sun light and the sun was  blocked by large cloud cover, it was still very far away

anyway  the result was a psychosis that sent me to the hospital, i kinda  recovered and i agreed with my psychiatrist, it was an hallucination,  but then the supernatural event continued afterward when i got back  home, 2 or 3 times i felt people around me in my room and i even heard  faint voice of my sister calling for me, she seemed , i wouldnt say  scared but more worried, I also had 5 or 6 psychic event ,telepathy  mostly about women i loved and could have relationship with , i could  also feel other people emotion through music and i had electrical  phenomenom as well, it lasted about till a bit before my nde wich was in  march 2018 and lasted a year afterwards

now  its only when i learned of the near death study by raymond moody that I  knew what I had was a near death experience, i also learned of bio  centrism by robert lanza and quantum immortality

today im 120% positive it was a  death experience, i died in another reality and became a ghost",08Sep2019,0
57,"As my profile reads, I'm 21; my birthday was in July. Being diagnosed with bipolar at 16, and dealing with a lot of messed up stuff in my life has led me to have a much older mentality so I have a tendency to surprise people when they find out how old I actually am. 

We recently got some new coworkers at the small pet store I work for. I was promoted to keyholder a few months back, and I have the most authority and seniority besides the assistant manager and store manager; yesterday was my two year anniversary of being there. 

With the new coworkers sometimes I play a game of, ""Guess how old you think I am,"" and I've got varying answers from 24 to 27 no one has ever guessed my actual age and when they find out, they always seem shocked. One of the store's dog groomers is 6 months older than me (also 21), and (not trying to sound judgemental) spends most of her nights partying and getting drunk and I've never had an interest in that sort of thing due to it potentially screwing up my meds, and my boyfriend (27) being a recovering alcoholic. Even my boyfriend thought it was mid-20s when we met a couple months before my 19th birthday. 

I've never understood why people think I'm a lot older until recently, but I've noticed that people always mention that it's the way I carry myself in a professional manner at work, as well as, again, me having to grow up quickly from a young age. I find it a little funny though with how some of them will say, ""No way you're that young,"" or, of course, ""Now I feel old.""",08Sep2019,0

61,"I really hope you guys can have a look at this awfully long post, a outside thought is really useful to me as I'm depressed and confused. Thank for your time and have a nice day.

&amp;#x200B;

The story starts 2 years ago when I was a form three student at secondary school. I am now 15.

Every year there will be new classmates and someone will stay. It was the year that R came to our class. Before talking to her for the first time, I heard that she is kind of a bitch (talk stuff before others back and being friends way too casually with boys)

I didn't really take that seriously and tried to talk and befriend with her. At first, no one in our class seems to dislike R whatsoever, most of them are friends with her. Anyway, we started to befriend, I tried to chat and take care of her (70% on Whatsapp since I didn't think there were needs to talk to her in person). We would talk about stuff like how's your day, how 's your health and we sometimes talk about funny stuff about our common friend and stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't know that I was talking too much to her way since I always think me and R are the good friend that will never run into a romantic relationship. But sadly, she did think I was in love with her and she thought it was weird to chat that much. She started to ignore me. After constantly asking her why she messaged me and said that she saw me as a good friend and didn't want to hurt me. I explained that I didn't love her, she said it's good. She started to ignore me later anyway.

I was really sad and mad at the same time. At one hand I really loved her as a friend, I said a lot of stuff and I wouldn't normally say and I didn't want to lose a close friend (at least thought we were). At the other hand, I was mad and angry because I treated her as a close friend and I felt like she didn't think I was shit. 

This is something I will always be ashamed by: I began to bomb R with a thousand of message every day. As my mood swinging between feeling sad and mad. I would tell her about how sad and how much I wanted to reunite, and how much I hated her the same time EVERYDAY.  IT WAS AWFUL!

I thought I hate her with my full hurt but I wasn't. She began to have a closer feeling with a boy called T. At the end of the school term he became her boyfriend. During the time, I knew that T was a douchebag and was in love with her for her body. The reason is that they have a lot of touching during class time, to a point where even a teacher noticed it.  Due to that, I began to text bomb R a lot about how she should leave T. It didn't work. This, however, showed myself that I really loved her, and I couldn't know whether I was as a friend or someone who loved her.

I was even more mad at both R and myself because no matter how much I texted R, she didn't block me, she ignored me. I felt as my love or energy have been wasted and I couldn't pull that aways because I did love her. It wasn't like easy. I said mean stuff (again, I am ashamed by it) like you're a slut (and I feel like she is at this moment).

She then began to talk to others about what I said to her. And they began to ""bully"" in real life and talk shit about me.

&amp;#x200B;

After the beginning of last year, they eventually broke up and R's friend actually called T douchebag. R blocked me on Whatsapp.

Even though last year ended and we still haven't talk. I still cared about R. When someone bad contacted her I felt bad. I promised her that I would protect two years before and I still remembered it. But I also hated her for what she did to my other relationships by talking shit about me to others.

I am confused about whether I hate her or love her. As time goes by and I am leaving the school next year to college, I don't want to be regret about what I felt. What do you guys think?",08Sep2019,1
62,"Hey!

I'm a man in his 30s who has spent a... Long time barely dealing with a whole lot of bad stuff that happened/was done to me. 

I'm in a great long-term relationship with someone who I know loves and supports me, but because of a history of abandonment, gaslighting, emotional (and physical) abuse, and being compared to people for all ways I'm not good enough, I've never developed the confidence to really be comfortable with myself. 

During a depressive episode and subsequent conflict discussion we came to the conclusion that I've been relying on her as a way to distract myself from all the negative shit other people, and therefore I, believe about me, swirling in my head on a constant basis. As she rightfully pointed out, that doesn't diminish the love and dedication behind our relationship, but it puts a lot on her plate to always be my support that's starting to take a toll on our dynamic. 

She's told me she sometimes doesn't ask how my day went if she knows it went poorly, not because she doesn't care, but because she doesn't have the emotional resources to support me with that. It's fair, but it also feeds into my other stuff. I need to get my shit together, obviously for me, but also for us; I've been hoping it could just happen with someone believing in me hard enough but I'm finally seeing that it needs to be internal.

I'm finally consistently in therapy and reading a lot about processing trauma and emotional regulation but I'm not sure if there's anything more I can really be doing to build a sense of self worth when I never... really... had one.",08Sep2019,2
64,"Last night there was a ""white tee shirt party"" and shit was crazy.  I'd gone through high school with pitiful self confidence and esteem socially, your standard sorta ""smart kid"", though started to get better throughout 12th grade.

I come into university and now I feel like I've got a shot at being liked and respected just like anyone else; the number of like-minded people is just staggering.

Anyways, what I really wanted to say is how big of a fucking dunce I am in spite of it all.  Later on in the night, this pretty, smart, kind, fucking amazing girl really seemed like she was about to hook up with me.  I was incredibly drunk and, being the way I am, incredibly measured in what I did worried I was misreading things.... I was hesitant to make any moves.

So we are in this one dorm and I'm sitting on the couch talking to my buddy and she comes over and sits right on the armrest.  I'm still a little rattled, because I've still got the remnants of my low self-esteem and absolutely abhor the idea that I make an unsolicited move.  My buddy keeps gesturing for me to put my arm around her, I refuse, she (likely noticing my indecisiveness), puts her leg it between mine now.  I put my arm around her now and make an attempt to talk for a little because I'm genuinely interested in people beyond fucking them (that's probably my redeeming characteristic I'm thinking in this one, just simply not being an asshole... sad to think about it).

After a few minutes she gets up and grabs my hand beckoning to go somewhere.  She walks in front of the table and - **CRASH**! - she trips over a USB cable knocking over a limited-edition cup.  I, feeling incredibly shameful for something I didn't even do, hurried to clean the mess and apologize to the host (again, probably another thing redeeming about me).

The group of three of us hopped to another dorm and I was getting lustful stares for the next hour.

Again.  I'm a fucking dunce and never acted on anything.

Also, it's shittier when you kind liked them as a person too, but I feel like all anyone ever wanted to do was hookup.

I have another $60,000 in debt between repossessions and loan and credit card defaults. And I can't even compete in the entry-level job market where I live right now, all because of gaps in employment and in qualifications and experience.

I can hardly look at myself at this point. How in the hell could I have put in *all this work* to have *nothing* to show for it?

CompTIA and Cisco certifications, sales operations, process optimization, project management... I've made hiring decisions and launched new service offerings. I've taken a 5 month onboarding process for sales professionals and reworked it into a 7-week process, closed training gaps, and deployed it successfully. I flipped *Boeing* into a six-figure deal after three years of my old company trying to get their attention. But the only thing people are willing to pay me to do is wrap pallets with cellophane or tape 170 boxes an hour.

I don't understand why or how *this* has become the hand I'm dealt. I did the work. I put in the time. I never shy away from acting to acknowledge gaps in my skillset or knowledge or experience and fill them as effectively as possible. I've been that person that shows up first and leaves last *every day of the workweek and sometimes on the weekends*. But it seems like there's always an arbitrary hurdle at play, some other requirement (like three years experience reprocessing nuclear waste for a $13/hr. school janitor position) and I'm not someone who can succeed against those expectations.

This is a confusing time. I struggle to feel there's anything possible moving forward in life everytime I have to lie down to sleep in a recliner in my mom's living room. I do and don't want to accept this. But between having to do this alone (limited social contact over the last two years) and having to do *this* at all... I just sometimes struggle to understand how I will ever be able to look *back* and not see the exact same life I see when I look *forward*.",08Sep2019,1

67,"I currently don't have any hobbies but I have a ton of interests. Things like cooking, martial arts, parkour, video gaming, running, archery, going to the movies, traveling, geocaching, biohacking and more are all interests of mines but I can't really say that they are hobbies because I do not do them. 

I have two primary reasons which stop me from pursuing any of these seriously:

1) the costs of them, some of them are inexpensive but require either money to truly engage in them or transportation which I have niether of

2) Horrible crippling anxiety, things like running, geocatching and parkour which don't require any money to do just make me feel embarrased to even try it in public. Doing it alone makes me feel like I will be viewed as a weirdo and I am too socially awkward to find friends who do it with me.

72,"First week of university and my ex-nerd (not really, but no social butterfly for sure) ass almost got laid.

Was out partying with a buddy and this girl we met a while back.  She ended up sitting on my lap and next thing I know shes grabbing my hand and beckoning me to go somewhere.  She trips over a USB cable, shatters a glass (this was in someone's dorm who we didn't know).  I was more guilty and concerned about cleaning up the glass that I forgot what was happening.

She was eyeing me down for the rest of the night but I never made a move... like for a solid hour she would just stare me down when nothing else was happening.  Not sure what made me special, I'm not particularly attractive or ugly, a solid 5/10 like my best friend agreed.  I've got brains but nobody can tell that by just looking at me and I never really let it slip... plus a hookup is way too depersonalized for anyone to actually care.

Life will probably go on like nothing happened, I'll probably see her around and just be friends.  God I'm one awkward motherfucker sometimes.  I'm good on the surface level and can be suave when I'm not really tapping into my emotions, but when shit gets real I start to shit myself.

74,"I sometimes suspect I'm not neurotypical but it has never been treated or diagnosed officially.

So, my father used to be some kind of sometimes before I was born. He stayed at home and took care of me, and since always he has done everything right.

He is very clever and when I lived back home he always knew what I was up to.

I have a bit of a feeling of debt with him because he raised me and ""if it weren't for him now I would be broken like [family with mental problems]"".

He knows how to hurt me but not much and it's impossible to argue with him because he spends straight 20 min talking to answer each sentence.

So when I was like ten or so, knowing I'm very good at school, decided to get smart af and get a grant in another city university and get out of home.

The plan worked, and I left home at 17. When I was 20 I became financially independent.
Each time I hoped that I would become independent irl doing so, but no.

A months ago, he came to visit to my shared apartment and I felt very insecure and invaded - I don't really remember if he asked if he could come, but I think not.

Today it happened again, I had come to a familial visit and he said I am ""more or less independent"", and I looked him dead in the eye and he said ""well, I paid for your apartment's insurance"", which is like 150€ per year and it's nothing for me, but he insists on paying it to leverage me.

Every now and then I refrained from doing things because I knew he would know at last, until I was independeny financially, but when he came to my apartment I don't feel safe anymore - again.

Like, he has a very conservative view of family and I have a very liberal one, and he won't accept that I've grown up ever.

I took a risk and went a different college than my friends, far from home, and it didn’t work out. While I was there I fell into a pretty bad depression, which derailed my the good grades that were characteristic of me. I made few friends, and the ones I had, I didn’t cherish. I thought of them as temporary friends and they just made me miss the ones I had in my home town. The whole time I was there, I wanted to be back in my home town. I decided I was going to transfer to a college in my hometown, and it dawned on me as I approached the end of the school year that I was never going to see these friends again, as they were all staying at this college. So I got home, and had a very hard adjusting period to leaving my couple friends. Now that I’m back, I’m going to college, but living at home with my parents as I can’t afford to live on campus anymore. I feel depressed yet again. I tried the college experience, and didn’t enjoy it. And now on the outside looking in, I regret losing it. Everyone I know is experiencing it, and I spend my weekends at home with my parents sitting on my phone until I fall asleep at 3 in the morning. These are supposed to be the years of my life where I do stupid shit, have fun and make memories. Instead I am unhappy, alone, and envying the experience I missed/gave up.

80,"A few days ago, I guy that I met online (we're just friends) asked to video chat. This was seriously anxiety provoking. I tend to avoid video chat mostly because I cannot get out of head about my face. About two years ago, I gained 40 pounds because of an undiagnosed disorder, that was also causing my hair to fall. out. Gaining weight has given me chipmunk cheeks and amplified at least to me the fact that my face isn't symmetrical, although despite the recent changes in my appearances, i've still never thought that i was particularly attractive. I've just now started making lifestyle changes to try to manage the disorder. 

Anyway, cut to video chatting with this guy. I was really shy, but he seemed completely smitten with me. Like his eyes glazed over, he looked like the emoji with the heart eyes. This was surprising to me because he's also a really conventionally attractive guy and often talks about all the beautiful girls he's dating or going out with. He later texted me and told me he couldn't stop thinking about how beautiful I was. That made me smile, but a few of my immediate reactions were:

a) He mentioned that he had only slept two hours. He was obviously in a sleep deficit and wasn't looking at me closely enough and that's why he thought I was beautiful.

b) It was late at night, and he might have just gotten into his feels and that influenced his perception of me.

c) The lighting wasn't bright enough so he didn't get a good picture of what I looked like. 

d) He was being polite and nice, because he just didn't want to hurt my feelings because there's no way I compare to the other girls he's talked to. 

I'm frustrated with myself. There are definitely moments where I can see my beauty, but for the most part, I still find it hard to believe when someone comments on it. Any help would be appreciated!!",08Sep2019,2
81,"I used to be very skinny, unkempt and had terrible social anxiety. I had some attractive qualities, like my eyes/height/intelligence, but I really hated myself. I tried anxiety meds etc. but those never seemed to work. The only thing that worked for me was changing my diet, sleep schedule and, specifically, weightlifting.

Jump forward a year and a half and I’ve gained 40 pounds, mostly muscle. I started grooming myself very heavily (my morning skin/hair routine is like an hour and a half), and got rid of my ill-fitting clothes and replaced them with fewer, simpler clothes that fit perfectly and rely on the fundamentals of fashion to avoid wearing trendy stuff.

I look good. Really good. My family and I visited a big city during the Summer and my mother asked me afterwards: “Do you have any idea of how many people were staring at you...?” School started again 2 weeks back and less confident girls nervously pull out their phones and stare down when I walk past them on campus. Groups of girls will sometimes get super quiet and whispery when I sit down near them at a restaurant. A guy who used to pick on me for being too anxious when I order food there was flabbergasted when I walked in and goes “You uh... you look kinda different.” Well fantastic: problem solved I’m a cutie who is drowning in beautiful people etc etc.

Not really.

I really don’t know what the hell to do when talking to girls who don’t fit the “nerdy quiet type” stereotype (the only girls who used to give me the light of day). That type of person is very rare on this campus anyway, it’s kind of a party school, and I don’t party. Every quiet type girl that I’ve met has transferred. Literally every single one. Anyway- Most interactions go like this:

Elevator with someone gorgeous: 

Me: “Hi how’s it going”
Them: “Good and you?”
Me: “I can’t complain.”
“...”
“...”
*elevator opens, end scene.

This is me in class. This is me in clubs. This is me meeting friends of roommates. Don’t even get me started on approaching someone while they are doing something else. I mean that mostly freaks me out because the general twitter consensus that if you approach a girl while she’s busy reading or sitting by herself etc, you are a creep. So I never ever try to do that...

Not to mention I’m African American on an overwhelmingly white campus, so I already feel like I’m a fish out of water.

I don’t know... I kinda feel like Steve Rogers when he gets transformed into a buff dude, then tries to talk to Peggy, and it’s super awkward because he literally doesn’t know how to talk to girls (not that I’m that much of a hunk-cicle, I mean cmon now).

On the first day I met up with one of my internet friends who was also attending my college (yay) and so I thought wow this is going to be an amazing day.


I walk in and who do I see? The girl I fell super hard for. We used to be super close friends. I got a crush. It wasn’t reciprocated. It got awkward. We stopped talking.

I was literally heartbroken over this girl even though we were never romantically involved lol.


Later on that day she popped up to my Snapchat story and was like “omg I didn’t know u were going to [my college]” and I had to pretend I didn’t see her and actively avoid her.


Idk what I’m supposed to do now. Like I guess I’ll have to be her friend but thinking about having to do that literally makes me tear up like I don’t think I’m emotionally prepared for that idk I just think I’d rather never have to see her again.

So recently my life has turned into a mess. I have been depressed, and not in a good mindset. I know I've hit a rock bottom if I am writing this on a reddit. I'm at a loss for words. All my closest friends for over 8+ years just completely stopped talking to me, and when I confronted them, they laughed and kinda mocked me, so i removed them all on social media, and just stopped talking to them. This happened about a month ago, and no one has texted me or tried to contact me. It fucking sucks. I'm really sad a lot of the time and feel like I've hit rock bottom.

Well I got a job, and I met this girl and we hit it off the first night, flirting etc. She seems cool or what not until I find out she's 17 next time I saw her (I told her my age as well). I don't truly feel comfortable going after a 17 year old when I am 21 years old, I just don't think that is right in my opinion. (I personally don't even want a relationship with anyone at the moment) At work she'd still flirt with me and say how big and strong I was. and I would flirt a little bit back too but I'm feeling conflicted. I am so lonely, and just want to have a friend to talk to and have a life outside instead of staying in my basement depressed. I've been planning on returning back to college etc and started working out to get my life back on track and get a handle on it.

Well me and her hung out and I helped her with some school stuff and it went well. It was nice to talk to someone, and get to know them better. I don't know what I should next. Cuz my hormones are going crazy, and I really want a friend, but don't want to mess anything up or be stupid. So I need some advice on what to do next with this. Any advice is welcome. Thanks

We didn’t expect it was going to be so social, and to our luck we were placed with another couple who were the nicest people but most importantly, very similar to us. They were visiting the country for the first time on their honeymoon and we had many topics which we clicked on. It’s strange for us to keep a conversation going with complete strangers, but this felt so easy and we were having such a great time. We left the venue without exchanging contact info because we thought it would be weird to ask something like that to people we only met an hour before.

106,"I'm just gonna blabber on so you dont have to read it all but I need to get it off my chest

Last night, I was just walking around my kitchen like I do almost everyday and I felt bad memories resurface of my mom. I remember when the doctor asked me if I missed my dad( they divorced when I was young) and I started bawling my eyes out because I missed him very much. I did use to visit him on the weekends but that suddenly stopped for reasons I can not remember. When the appointment ended, we went back to the car and when my mom was starting to back out she noticed I was of course still somewhat crying. She sighed and just said in am annoying tone ""Oh stop crying!"" I listened but thinking about it now it really was heartless of her to say such a thing when she knew why I was crying. I think the reason why I was crying is the reason she got annoyed because she hated hearing anything about my dad. 

Another one is just remembering how violent she can get. One day I was helping her lift some thing downstairs and what not with my headphones on. She never likes when I have them on when she needs to talk to me so when I have them I usually have one ear open to hear. I didnt have my ear open and she was trying to tell me something but of course I didnt hear. Instead of trying to get my attention, she aggressively ripped the headphones(they were over ear) off my head and of course screamed at me. 

Then another recent one was during my brother graduation. We came early enough to save two or so seats for family and she entrusted me with that responsibility as she went off to take care of my brother(he's disabled). I saw a black couple coming down our aisle and decided to be nice by moving the stuff she put down since my family was late. I agree it was a bit selfish to think ""Oh my family can just stand and watch"" I mean it was just my aunt and uncle coming. They weren't that old like my grandparents. When my mom noticed this, she started yelling at me for not saving them and I just bowed my head down not saying a word. The couple just said ""We'll move, dont worry."" If I could turn back time, I would've just walked out and miss the ceremony. Like all that yelling just for seats... 

I am working on moving tf out as quickly as possibly and just leaving her forevor. I cant stand how she can be sometimes and its ruining my mental state.

But the more I reflected on it,  I just can't feel anything anymore. Literally the actual emotions and feelings. When the songs end or the videos end, I'm just in auto mode again. I hate it and it feels so bad. So yes, it is very corny, but it evokes feelings in me, any feelings. I just want to feel anything. And without those tools, all I'd have left are drugs.",08Sep2019,1

111,"I feel like my life is on standby. Well, not really, because things keep happening, I'm working on stuff that I actually need, I'm putting effort and all that, but I feel like all of this isn't going anywhere. I'm in uni, I chose it based on the thing that I found less boring. I know that what I chose will give me a good paying job, but I don't know what job. I don't have that much aspiration, I don't have that much conviction on what I'm doing. Hell, I don't even know what job I want to do, ""whatever"" seems fine as long as it pays. Everything is as if I'm waiting for a ""call"", something to happen that I can put 100% of myself into it and feel satisfied by it. Although I'm a good, well-behaved little boy, I always had an anarchic spirit, so I guess I'm waiting for some sort of revolution (not even anything political, just... Something). I want to be able to leave everything behind and just... Go. I don't care about any of my accomplishments so far, and I know I won't care about any of my accomplishments in the future. I want one thing, one single thing that... Drives me. Fully. I know I'm driven by the  *""uuuh gotta make money to live comfortable""* reasoning, but that's not what I need. I need something that compels me to wake up in the morning and be at it until late at night, something that keepd me at it until it's fully done, something that shakes me every time I look at the grandeur of it. Something that I can see myself being proud of it

Will I find this ""something""? Or should I just give in to the fact that there is no ""something"".

Just wanted to throw this out there, I don't have anyone to share it with since it's very late. And I did.",08Sep2019,9

 I've been avoiding thinking about what to do with my life. It stresses me out. But it's about time I start thinking of what I'm going to do. I started searching for degrees in demand and they were mostly based on math. I'm not very good at it, never was. I considered human resources. That seemed like something I would like.

114,"My relationship with my parents has always been hollow and strained by their emotional codependency, and it’s constantly setting me and my husband on edge. I have realized as an adult that this is not normal. And that my relationship with them is founded entirely in guilt and a sense of filial obligation. I secretly wonder all the time (with accompanying guilt) if I will feel any real sense of grief when they someday pass.

Meanwhile, my husband’s mother is the opposite and has made me realize what a good mom looks like. She is so warm, loving, and actually gives a shit. And she actually does things to help us out as we raise our young son. She’s coming to visit us in a few weeks, and I’m going to try to express to her how much I appreciate having her in our lives. I am so afraid of becoming my parents; I would do anything to be the kind of mother that my son deserves and not the shitty parents I grew up with. I’m really glad I have someone else in my life I can emulate.

115,"Hi everyone!!

Super proud of myself, but I've officially made the decision to leave this guy behind. Part of the reason that I've hesitated is because I know we're just friends and I feel weird about not being friends with someone.  I've had the hugest crush on him for a while. He's one of those good looking guys, who is also witty, and SO charming and is frequently asked out. He would keep telling me how good of friends we were and how he considered me one of his best friends (I helped him get through a really crappy breakup). He knows my reddit username so that's why this is under a throwaway account.

Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, he would send me flirty messages. I don't think he was actually interested in me, but was just using me as entertainment because he knew that I cared about him.  In contrast, when I flirted with him, (before he got the girlfriend) it came from a really real place. Recently, we videochatted, and he was seriously amazed because he thought that I was so pretty. Apparently, he didn't think I was pretty from the pictures that  he saw of me, but seeing me on video changed something? (Wtf, right??) The part of me that had a low self esteem felt so incredibly happy and validated...because of the way he constantly hyped himself up and talked about himself, I figured that he was out of my league and it felt good to be considered beautiful by someone who I knew was intensely desirable.

Anyway, just posting this because I feel so relieved.",08Sep2019,1
117,"RANT RANT RANT!!!   
IRL- I only have 1 friend who is not considered family. My best girlfriends are now my sister-in-laws. I work as a Homecare Provider for my husbands grandmother who has dementia. My father-in-law works from home 75% of the time and is not too understanding of the disease. I apparently “complain” about this to my husband too often and have now put him in between a rock and a hard place. Saying “well you know how he gets so why do you let it bother you” because it’s my opinion that i dont become upset at a 79 year old woman with dementia who is Incontinent. I understand the frustration of having to change out and do laundry constantly, but this woman is a shell of who she was and it’s really not her fault she can’t hold it or make it to the bathroom in time.  I made the mistake of telling my husbands older sister when she asked “how’s grandma enjoying being away from dad, she made a comment about XYZ at a party and i had to say no he didn’t do that grandma” and i told her that she was wrong and that did happen. Which in turn upset her and she broke our confidence and called her parents drunkenly upset and that they needed to treat her better. So clearly they knew that information came from me. And in that moment i cut closeness with her because i knew she couldn’t keep what i said between us. Most people have stories about their employers and mine happens to be their parents. So now my husband has told me that it’s getting too difficult to listen to me describe what’s annoying me throughout my day. Which now makes me realize that i have no friends to confide it that can’t get back to my family. I dont have anyone to randomly text and tell them what’s happening in my day that may relate to my in-laws. I dont have anyone i can go out with and blow steam off with; which should be my husband but isn’t. I confided in him that his younger sister received an unsolicited dick pic which she shared with me in confidence and after he says he won’t bring it up, 3 hours later and a couple cocktails down he corners her infront of me and says “we have a conversation that needs to be had. I know what you’re doing” and she looks at me and says what did i do and she asked him what did i do and he just continues “we’ll talk later but i know” and i have to doe eye her and say i have no idea what he’s talking about. Like WTF. I told you not to say anything. And here you are. Drunkenly telling someone something i asked you not to. Just like his sister. Which again brings me back to the realization that I’m lonely to the point that i want to branch out and do meetups and social groups WITHOUT my husband.  I love my alone time, but that doesn’t mean i dont need someone to talk to and confide in. Everything gets around this family like a game of telephone that has miscommunication entangled all over.   I just feel like i have no one to confide in and am looking for someone to talk to. It’s like how do these people get catfished? How do you meet those people besides dating apps and sites? I’m not looking to cheat but i am looking for a friend.",08Sep2019,1

124,"After a recent break-up of 4 years, someone I lived with and connected with for so long, ended up badly where she found someone (not sure if it was already planned, but that's neither here nor there) two weeks after our separation.  Weeks on end I was so bored, I would check IG, stalk her, and recently would actively look on our mutual friends stories to see her.  Well, this morning I saw something that made my heart break even more than it is, so I made the decision to delete ALL of my social media (Instagram and Twitter.)

My best friend even changed the passwords on them so I have no temptation to re-sign in to activate.  This feels good, however I am wondering if anyone else can give some advice on previous experience when deleting all respective and relatable social platforms?

I have a plan to get back on my feet, both financially and mentally by next year, and I feel like social media as well as other vices were getting in the way -- so I completely eradicated them from my life.  The anxiety kicks in because I am lonely most of the time in my place and accessing social media was my go-to to kill time.  Perhaps reading, or making music can substantiate the time, but really, any advice on my move here would really help.  In any sense, I feel like this is the right move to improve my SELF.",08Sep2019,6
125,"I don’t want to get back into the nitty-gritty since it was literally the worst year of my life, but essentially this is what happened month by month from August-May, luckily everything got better during the last three months. I wish I was making this up.

August: Thought I made friends, found a roommate, and socialized with people; Roommate shit talked about me to friend group, clubs, classes, professor, floormates, etc. This was literally the last week of august.
 
September: Lead on by a horny college kid. Spiraled really hard and at the same time, was desperate for money. Started an escort service. Roommate’s rumors got worse. No one wanted to talk to me unless it was for sex. Roommate followed me to a restaurant during one of my “dates”, took pictures, and spread them around the school.

October: Became a prostitute in order to live anywhere but my dorm room because of my roommate. Got blamed for a lice problem my roommate had when I literally didn’t have lice, nor was i living in my room.

November: Roommate filed a false assault report to the school. I fought back. School didn’t respond. Spent the rest of the year trying to talk to everyone on campus, no one would really care about me because somehow I wasn’t the victim.

At the same time i got raped by someone claiming to be a “friend” of my friend. I didn’t realize it yet.

December: Went home miserable, finally broke down in front of parents and helped me find a lawyer to clear things up with the school. Luckily it was fixed but I wanted to sue the school for ignoring me completely on a assault claim that never happened.

January: Spoke to the dean about false assault claimed. Brushed me off like I was just “being bullied” and that “things like this were normal” I gave up my prostitution lifestyle after a pregnancy scare.

February: I tried to date my rapist. I was desperate. I literally was about to kill myself. I started vaping, drinking heavily, literally about to find hard drugs. The college was a cesspool of cocaine anyway. People started staring at me at my dorm. Heard people talking shit about me in a language I spoke.

March: I fell in love for the first time after five years of being abused by people and my first girlfriend. He helped me back up on my feet, and told me that I didn’t do anything wrong, despite knowing i basically sold my body for food and shelter and i got raped. He told me that I was definitely raped by the person i thought was my friend.

April: Told a big mouth about how I got raped. Got back to the “friend group.” Suddenly everyone broke contact with me and my boyfriend. Tried to re-friend my boyfriend. Suddenly questions about my rape were sent to my boyfriend. No one bothered to check on me. Friend group thought I was lying. Considered talking to my laywer, but it’s not worth the time or money. My rapist is suicidal and i hope he kills himself soon.

May: Finally left the school. Had to lie about why I was missing class. I was paranoid as all hell. I couldn’t attend class because I was scared of running into my rapist or my shitty roommate. My boyfriend had to coax me out for food. I almost failed my spring semester.

This August, I transferred out with my boyfriend who equally went through hell at our old school. Thank god it’s over. I’m no longer in a hellhole, I never have to see my rapist, my shitty friends, the thing called a roommate, or anyone at the school again.

We have three mice that are considered my ESA. My psychiatrist thinks I might have PTSD. I have a higher income due to my job liking me a lot, and giving me more hours. At least I can breathe now.",08Sep2019,4
126,"I'm so tired of my life. I have no real friends, no job, no motivation for anything, and the one thing I do that I get some relief from my meaningless existence, video games, is making my hands and wrists really hurt so now I don't even have that.

I'm 26 and still feel like that loser 16 year old I was in highschool, with one exception, I had friends back then. I love in a piece of shit town where it's been impossible to find a job and there is next to zero opportunity for improvement. I still love with my parents in the same room I did when I was a kid and while my Dad is my beacon of support and stability, my mom is a manic depressive with OCD who is one of the largest sources of anxiety in my life. And she also had the kindness to pass on her pension for mental illness onto me which is just fantastic. 

I spent my entire childhood learning to keep the anger caused by my illnesses in check and by all accounts I have made a tremendous amount of progress since then. I went from the kid who's likely gonna end up in prison to graduating from highschool with perfect attendance and a B average, and knew I wanted to become an engineer. Fast forward to now I'm still full of anger, I just don't act on it, I flunked out of engineering college after seven years of effort 2 years ago and haven't been successful in my attempts to get back in since. So much of my life has gone to shit that I'm now paralyzed with fear when it comes to doing anything. I spent all of 2018 just trying not to kill myself. 

I still wish I was dead I just don't want to kill myself. I wish I had died in the summer of 2016 in a car wreck or something. That summer I had my first job, after trying to find one for 5 years, I was to transfer to a real college in the fall, and while I may not have been super happy, I was optimistic and so where the people around me. They saw me maybe not doing exactly what I wanted, but I was making progress. If I had died then, my life would've ended on what looked like an upswing. I would've left behind minimal debt, and maybe more than just my family would've come to my funeral. 

I miss the most basic stuff about being alive. I miss being excited for tomorrow. I miss being able to tell someone what I've been up to without them suddenly looking like all the joy in the world had disappeared. I miss even just having a crush on someone let alone a GF. I'm tied of seeing the sadness in my Dad's eyes when he sees how miserable I am. I'm just so over trying any more. Why try to find a job, get back into school, get a degree,be sociable, and be a better person when all my effort proves fruitless. I'm still that unhappy, angry, fat sack of shit loser I was before, so why try.",08Sep2019,7

Little does my bf know but all of his transphobic, homophobic, misogynistic comments are racking up too. I live in a rural small town of almost all white people who smoke, drink and farm. The ignorance here runs deep, unfortunately. These fools both moved here though, so they have no real excuse.
