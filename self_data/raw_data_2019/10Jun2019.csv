And it's not even just my own money either, I can't even spend anyone else's money. Like if my friends or parents offer to buy me anything, it just hurts to use money. *Why am I like this...*

2,I‚Äôve heard the advice ‚Äújust talk to them like you would guys‚Äù and I‚Äôve tried but I still just freeze up and end up saying something stupid.

4,"Well interesting turn of events in my life.  I'm 40 years old and make..  Never been a very sexual person.  Never had much of a raging libido.  I am married and have a son.  

 In December I lost a testicle from an accident.  They had talked to me before the surgery about testosterone issues and stuff like that.  After my surgery I found I had basically zero libido.  Hardly got any erection at all and when I did it was laughable.  

I started the process to see if I needed testosterone therapy.  Turns out my levels aren't too low.  They're low but not enough for them to give me TRT.  So they do the usual Viagra and Cialis samples which did nothing.  Now they are running MRIs on my brain to see what's up.  My FSH female hormone levels are higher than in a normal female.  

I did however find myself looking at porn to try and trigger something back to life.  Btw... Porn sucks when you have no libido.  

I came across a couple videos of guys jacking off.  This is what managed to wake my sleeping member.  It was odd.   I've always been straight.  I've never been anti lgbtq at all.  A lot of my best friends were gay and such and great to be around. 

Well long story short on this I ended up on grinder and sucked 2 dicks in one weekend.   Haven't done anymore but it's helped to get me back on track I guess.   I'm not ashamed to be bisexual.  I kinda hope it doesn't go away after they figure out my hormones.  But such as it is.",10Jun2019,38
5,"Background: So I‚Äôm going to be a sophomore biomedical engineering/pre-med major at a school where I got a pretty good academic scholarship. This year I was involved in cancer nanomedicine research and women in engineering groups. 

Problem: All of freshman year I saw girls in sororities having a pretty solid community, a good social life, and a place to belong. Before college, I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want to be in one because the girls I knew who did them were all fairly shallow and self-centered. Now, however, I‚Äôm not so sure.
I‚Äôm trying to get more involved on campus this upcoming year in general, but especially in philanthropic and service oriented groups. I‚Äôm thinking that rushing a sorority might be a good way to accomplish that goal but I guess I have a ton of reservations. I don‚Äôt want to be stigmatized and I don‚Äôt want to be stuck surrounded by a group of girls who I don‚Äôt fit in with. It also kind of feel like paying for friends...

6,"So for some background info, I am going to turn 15 in about a month and I weigh somewhere between 94 and 98 pounds. I have been trying to gain muscle but was having issues with resolve and perseverance (aka being lazy), but I've gotten better. Now I did research and see people saying there are all kinds of workouts for a variety of bodies, eat this specific diet drink these kinds of shakes, and I watch videos of these complex workouts and after 6 weeks the body will get used to a workout so switch it up and all that jazz. So its kinda hard to put into words but my question is basically does anyone have uncomplicated and not confusing tips on how to gain some serious muscle. I don't need it to be quick gains, I just want to get big. I just need tips. Thanks",10Jun2019,2

8,"All I have wanted for a really long time was just to like myself and my body. For most of high school I've been on again off again trying to lose weight through calorie reduction and now Intermittent fasting. The problem is that I have no self control and inevitably end up giving in and eating a ton at the end of a good week, and ruin any chance I had at losing weight. 

I am at a normal weight for my height, but I didn't use to be. In elementary school and middle school I was overweight, but eventually I got to where I am now through calorie reduction losing about 50 pounds. I thought that if i lost that weight I would have a body that I'd like, that I wouldn't hate myself anymore, but that's not what happened. I guess the most accurate way to describe my body would be ""skinny fat"". I'm not overweight, but I'm definitely not lean enough to be attractive. 

Every time I go to the bathroom I compulsively lift my shirt up and look at my torso in the mirror. It's almost like I'm checking if I magically lost weight since the last time I checked, or like I'm just gauging how bad my body is, honestly its hard to explain. I  also do this with my face using my phone. I do it so often that other people have noticed and made fun of how often I use my phone to check my face or fix my hair.

In the past year this has all just gone up a notch. I find that all I'm thinking about is my body and food, either I'm hungry because I'm trying not to eat too much, or I'm upset and hate myself because I ate too much. Lately I've been trying to make myself throw up after I eat too much.  I have trouble getting anything significant out of my stomach though, so I don't think its doing much other than burning my esophagus. All of this and my weight has barely shifted

I think that a lot of this stems from the fact that I'm gay. Obviously not all gay people hate their bodies, or themselves, but I know what I find attractive in men, and when I look at myself I don't see any of that. I see this disgusting skinny fat blob of a person.  I just want to look attractive to other people instead of like this disgusting freak.

&amp;#x200B;

I recognize that I probably have some form of mental illness, and thus my perception of my body is somewhat deluded, and that I should probably go to a therapist. Logically that makes sense. But all that I feel is this passionate self-loathing and this desire to take control over my body and change it. If I go to a therapist all the will do is trick me into liking this disgusting body, and I will never actually look good. 

Honestly I'm just so tired and I don't know what to do anymore. I just ate an entire bag of chips and a bunch of almonds and protein bars, and then tried to make myself throw up. Tomorrow I will probably eat next to nothing in an attempt to redeem myself for today, but by this time next week I will probably have just gorged myself again.  I recognize that what I'm doing isn't resulting in weight loss anymore and isn't healthy, but I just don't know what else to do.",10Jun2019,2

10,"Hey, quick post because I really need to go to sleep. Hopefully I get some fast replies. 

A few months ago I came across this guy. The post he made caught my attention and I subbed to him. I kinda forgot about him for a while because I was in boot camp for 5 months. When I came back I got on reddit and forgot about him. Last week I was searching on my list of subs and I found his username. 

I went and read over his posts and holy cow. Like this guy has had an identical life to mine. Like he‚Äôs gone through hell and back. There‚Äôs a few differences the biggest and current one is that my depression/social anxiety/ selective mutism went away suddenly during my senior year of HS. 

Idfk what I‚Äôm trying to say is, I know exactly how he feels. I sent him a msg a few days ago and he like opened up a bit but then a few hours ago he made a post. I reached out again and told him to text me (in his post he talked about how he feels like a burden when he texts people etc) and that I liked texting people about literally anything. And to not feel like a burden etc. 

Guess what I‚Äôm trying to ask is, how can I help?? When that was me a few years ago I wish someone would‚Äôve put in effort to try to talk to me but no one did ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I had to dig myself out. Like there has to be more I can do to help

12,"When I broke up with my partner 10 months ago I was devastated. But honestly I know it was the right choice because I have grown so much in that time.

I feel like because I‚Äôm not longer as scared and self hating I can enjoy life and discover things and enjoy people so much more. It feels like a new life. 

I still struggle with things but it so so so much better. 

It makes me a little sad to feel like why couldn‚Äôt I have done this with my partner? I think although he was loving he was a fraud of a lot of things and convinced me I had to be too. He also wasn‚Äôt very understanding of my anxiety and made me feel bad expressing myself rather than be there to listen. He‚Äôs still really struggling and not doing much with himself and that makes me sad. But I‚Äôm glad to be where I am and feel like I‚Äôm moving forward.

13,been waiting all day for my boyfriend to text me back. texted him a simple good morning and then later on texted him asking him what his plans were. Got nothing in return. Saw him on Instagram.

Still didn‚Äôt like that he could find time on his break to go on insta but not text me back. Then it gets time for him to be off. Still nothing. Then he sends me a post on insta. I wanna be livid. I tell myself give him a minute. Then I get a text and it‚Äôs a screenshot. But here‚Äôs the thing. It opened up a new chat with us. Causing me to believe he never got my other messages. And now I feel like crap for thinking he was ignoring me all day. And I hate myself for essentially waiting all day for a reply. I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm even typing this out or what good it‚Äôs going to do. But I can‚Äôt even face him to ask if he got the other texts. Cause at this point it‚Äôs clearly a no.

15,"As I stair into the baby monitor for another sleepless night I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling my 7 month old son will pass away if I‚Äôm not watching him. I‚Äôve always dealt with anxiety. My entire life I‚Äôve been labeled a ‚Äúworry wart‚Äù and constantly am fearing death.


Every time I enter a vehicle I‚Äôm in constant fear I will wreck, maybe the car will explode or worse....I kill my family. At night I‚Äôm so sure someone is coming into the house to take my child. My son currently has a slightly blood shot eye....what if it is an infection and travels up into his brain and causes permanent brain damage or kills him.

These are just the thoughts I have taking a shower. Why can‚Äôt I relax? Why can‚Äôt I just enjoy my healthy beautiful baby boy my husband and I wanted so badly? 

Postpartum anxiety is an absolute nightmare and most people don‚Äôt even know it is a thing. I was suicidal most of my life. I never feared dying because well, who cares anyway?

19,"She was a horrible person to me, and I would still take her back if she said the right words. She manipulates meand mocks me and makes a fool out of me, she brings out the worst side of me, she took me to my limits I didn‚Äôt even knew I had and broke me and I am so ashamed of myself, and she did all this because she was bored. 

When she was done using me, she moved on and left me but kept calling me, gaslighting me, she won‚Äôt let me move on. It‚Äôs been more than six months since she dumped me. 

She emasculated me, she used sex to mock me and manipulate me, and we never even did it. Now she uploads more revealing photos to her IG for everyone to see than whatever she ever sent me. I‚Äôm not exagerating, it feels horrible, I can‚Äôt even watch regular porn because I get flashes that‚Äôs someone else having sex with her. 

Sometimes I want to hurt her. And I am so ashamed of feeling this way. I used to love this girl, now I can‚Äôt think of her without ruining my day and feeling the desperate need to vent, give back some of the pain she caused me. 

I want to yell at her, I want to see her and yell at her and vent and make her cry and feel like shit for everything she has done to me, but I know how things would really go, just like they always do, but I know if we met it would end badly. I would confront her, she would laugh it up and mock me, as always, then keep mocking me until I snap, only this time, I‚Äôm really going to hurt her.

If I told you half the things she has done to me, you guys would join me and help me hide the body, but I don‚Äôt want pity, and I don‚Äôt want to take revenge or to fix things, I just want to erase everything that happened. As much as I try, I can‚Äôt let go of this rage, I can‚Äôt forget.

21,"So basically I've been doing a lot better this year after a few years of debilitating depression and anxiety. I was regaining self esteem and confidence and feeling overall positive about the future. What threw me back in a tailspin of anxiety was basically a mistake at the hair salon, where my long hair was cut to my shoulders. This has triggered all of my negative feelings again. Instead of positivity, I feel that feeling of doom. I feel like all of the self esteem and self acceptance that I built up was gone in an instance. And I've been struggling with the fact that I made this totally uneccessary decision when everything was going so well for me and did something to myself that makes me feel horrible about myself.

I haven't had an anxiety attack this bad in a long time. Everything feels completely unreal. Everything looks fake. Everything feels like it's crashing down on me. Everything feels like it's falling apart. And I had so much positivity just a few weeks ago. I can rationalize that my response is extreme but at the same time I feel so awful about myself with how I look now. I just keep having the thought that I did this to myself. I was getting better and now I've hurt myself.

I'm dealing with a lot of different feelings. Recently I've been seeing someone new and this was the first ""relationship"" I've had with someone other than my ex (which honestly that relationship is what was a catalyst to most of my depression and anxiety to begin with). I finally felt confident and pretty again when I began seeing him but he quickly let me know that this was a fwb situation because he wasn't ready for a relationship but that there was the possibility of a relationship later. He is on vacation with family for the next couple of weeks and I guess I have this (probably irrational) fear that he'll no longer be attracted to me because of this and that I'll have fucked up a relationship with someone that could have been something and made me so happy for the first time in forever. Also recently, I had my ex try to come back into my life which is all I thought I ever wanted then I found out he was engaged when we planned to hang out. I feel like that is affecting me more than I thought it would. There was a weird numbness and acceptance when it happened but I think it's subconsciously fucking me up a lot to lose him for good when he was always there and we would always get back together.

Also I have a back condition where my upper back is rounded more than normal which is another thing that hurts my self esteem. And now that my hair doesn't cover my back at all now, I feel vulnerable and exposed and it was kind of my security blanket with that.

I'm in the shower now and my head feels so weird. I just feel that oppressive darkness over me that I've felt with other panic attacks. And it's just beyond frustrating that I felt so good so soon ago and felt positive about life and now it's all back and triggered by something as fucking stupid as a bad haircut. I know I need a therapist and that probably shouldn't trigger this kind of intense episode but it's just so hard to accept that I made that decision to do that when it was unnecessary (yes the hairstylist fucked up and cut too much but I didn't even need a trim really). I just don't know how to deal with it. It took a year to grow as long as it did and I guess thinking about how long it would take to grow it back to that length i'm comfortable is is also terrifying to me, like how much time will pass. I can't really tell if I'm thinking irrational or not, my mind's just got me in a really dark place right now and i just can't get over the fact that this is totally self inflicted and i could feel perfectly at peace with everything if I hadn't made some stupid unnecessary decision to cut my hair. I felt so pretty with my hair growing long and now it's above my shoulders and I feel so unattractive. And fuck I thought I had gotten over these terrible anxiety attacks. It's just so crazy how you can realize that you're having an anxiety attack and yet still feel so helpless to it, like I realize these things are probably irrational thoughts and yet it still feels so fucking real and tangible and terrifying. :( Everything feels so fake and dark. I hate it.",10Jun2019,0

26,"I (21M) met a girl on a dating app. It was my first time ever actually meeting up with a girl from one rather. Just in case she sees this her name was C, she said she was 21, in the army, and she was Welsh (this is important later). Our first time meeting up was about 3 days after first starting to talk and all we did was walk around a lake for a few hours chatting about a bunch of things. It gets interesting when we have our first real date. A few days after walking around the lake. We went to our local downtown area and walked around got dinner and randomly encountered one of my best high school friends. Later that night we went to my house where we had a very nice time talking. C spent the next few days at my house, we had sex a few times. After the first night at my house she informed me that she had PTSD and was prone to episodes at night. Every single night after (about 3 or 4 nights) she had violent PTSD attacks where she would punch and kick at me for hours. She also had what i can only describe as full on seizures. Every night these happened. I slept about 2 hours a night just trying to take care of her.

 Eventually i took her home and before i left her at her mothers (she had told me she was on a long medical leave from the Army) she told me she was going to go inside and shoot herself in the head. I drove her around for as long as i could and took her to a park where she had a nonviolent episode and had to be helped step by step into the car. After talking she seemed to be in a better place mentally and i left her at her moms as i needed to go to work. Later that day she messages me that she is still suicidal. She says that she hates her life and that she is going to go OD on oxycodone after finding a guy to make her feel like a ""fuck toy"". I broke down at work. I walked outside and was trying to call and text her and find out where she was and what she was doing and begging her not to do it. This lasted 3 hours. My manager came out and called the police. I could barely breathe from how emotional i was over this. I'm not exactly an emotional person most of the time so this was an intense time for me. Eventually the police found her at a hotel, arrested her, and took her to a baker acting facility. 

She put me as the only person she wanted the doctor to contact and called me multiple times.
She was released 2 nights after being admitted.

I was supposed to pick her up. I insisted that the hospital have her mom there (i had never met her) so that i could talk to her before she was discharged. Her mom came along with her dad and sister. I told them everything and they said they didn't know any of this was happening. They told me they would support her getting help. Then they told me the truth... Her name was P, not C, she was 19 not 21, she was never in the Army, she isn't even Welsh at all. Everything I knew about her was a blatant lie. 

Her mom took her home and i told her that i would, against all the advice I'd gotten from friends, continue talking with her as a friend. I really felt a connection with her on a deeper level. I wanted to help her as much as i could. 

A few days after she discharged, i saw her in person again. We hung out and just talked about everything. She told me she was so sorry and that she believed that she had D.I.D. (dissociative identity disorder). C was another mind within P that I had met and spent almost a week with. 

We hung out more after and after a week or so we got intimate again. This time was gonna be different i told myself. We hung out about 3 times a week and we were in love. That is the only thing that i can say that even comes close to what i felt and what she said she felt. I felt i was getting a chance to meet the real her, P, for the first time. 

After about 2 weeks of being happy together, she called me and said she had fought with her mom and couldn't go home (They never had a good relationship and this was common). At about 5am i went and picked her up and talked until she fell asleep in my car. Then i fucked everything up by looking through her phone and asking why she was talking with other guys and still going by C and saying she was in the army and was Welsh. It was like everything we had meant nothing to her and i was just some guy she was using... we talked about it and i was giving a convincing explanation of everything that i eventually believed. 

Today, about 3 days after that, she told me she didn't want to see me any more. She is trying to join the army for real and needs to focus on herself. I found out while on break at work and i feel sick about it. I really feel like i love her, even after all the bullshit and everything. I don't understand why and i know i shouldn't but i can't help it. She was the person that i fell for, in more ways than one. She said she loved me but she had to focus on herself and fix her situation. I get it. I just wanted to help her. I guess i wanted to be needed by someone. Now I'm just hurt and alone trying to keep myself occupied so i don't have to think about it. 

I've been drinking a lot tonight and i probably left out a lot of details and things but i guess this is an okay summery for now. If you actually read all this then thank you. I can't put into words how much that means to me. Its been a wild and emotional ride these past few weeks but hopefully ill be better for it. That being said, fuck dating apps.",10Jun2019,3

30,"Okay so I‚Äôve seen some other posts asking questions about this. I literally had to download reddit and make a profile because this is so important to me and i want to share it. I used to smoke weed daily but after me and my boyfriend broke up a little over a year ago i‚Äôve gotten rEALLY bad anxiety (especially socially) and i mean major like for months i‚Äôve isolated myself because i‚Äôm ashamed to be so quiet and stuff. Then that led to severe depression. 

Anyways I started 10mg lexapro and it kinda gives me a boost of calmness. Now when I‚Äôm interacting with coworkers my mind isn‚Äôt so damn loud so thats good. Its only been like 4 days since I started it so I cant really say much. 

So me and my friend J went to a park today and I asked him to bring some weed bc I wanted to see how it would react to my meds and I‚Äôm comfortable around him and trusted him not to make me feel bad if i got anxious and had to dip. So he was rolling a spliff and I felt my heart dropping in my chest as it was most of the night but it was like the make it or break it moment right? It was either gonna amp my fear or chill me out. Sooooo we started walking and after my first hit i was already uplifted. The rest of the night if I ever had anxious thoughts i could just see them and accept them and move on. Overall it was a blissful and eye opening night. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ever seen me in that light. And I haven‚Äôt been so happy or confident so consistently in over a year!
If you‚Äôre thinking about taking Lex bc you‚Äôre in a bit of a darker place right now theres no shame in it. You gotta do what you gotta do man you only got one life.

31,"God, I don't know why I feel this way. 

So this guy, who we'll call Henry, who I last saw around late June last year. We had the same English class and that was it, but the beginning of my crush happened 2 and a half years ago- around November of 2016. At this time I was in 5th grade and I'm in 7th grade right now preparing to start high school in 9th grade in September (that's another story) I remember the exact moment this whole thing started, too. Ever since then not a day has gone by where he has not at the very least crossed my mind. He's just hilarious, and always found a way to make me laugh my heart out. 
Here's the thing: I was a total bitch to him. I was really cold and mean to him, and very rude. I got mad at him easily and the sweetheart he is never held a single of my outbursts against me. He defended me. A year later I never would've acted the way I did. I'm a lot different in terms of my emotional control and maturity. I've found without him near me I laugh a lot less. I used to be the kinda girl who laughed at every single thing, but now I feel blue, and it hasn't stopped since. I go to a different school now, but I'm going to the highschool he'll be going to (except I'll be a sophomore and he'll be a freshman) and we live nearby, I'm just nervous to go in any place he may be (like the grocery store or the drugstore) 
I know it probably isn't love, but when I think of him I feel blissful and content. I feel happy and warm and head over feet. I know it's weird, but sometimes I think about the possibility of us getting married. I think about how happy and grateful I'd be if in the future, we'd end up together. 
For 365 days I have prayed to God at night and in the morning for 2 things: safety for my family and friends and for Henry to come back to me.

Shortly after withdrawing from uni and beginning to teach myself to program came down with some weird symptoms that made it hard for me to breathe. Went to a bunch of doctors but mostly got brushed off and told I was probably just experiencing anxiety. Fast forward 4 years and never really completely solved it, but found out it's just a matter of sticking to a physical rehab routine and i'll be square.  No longer suffering, mostly chilling, and I can see now that it's just a matter of me doing what needs to be done so I can move on with my life, get a job and all that.   


Problem is I feel very little drive or motivation or even a sense of urgency. I'm confident that I can force myself to handle my responsibilities every day and I'm pretty sure everyone has this sort of problem but I just feel so flat and uninspired.

35,"  

Like many, many other men and women on the planet, PSTD has controlled my entire life since childhood. I can‚Äôt tell you precisely how many separate events during childhood and adolescence contributed to this; I simply don‚Äôt have an answer. Listing all of the events that I can even remember would require me to write an entire novel, and I‚Äôm not entirely certain that I‚Äôm ready for that. What I can tell you is that the trauma I experienced throughout my childhood and teenage years led to further trauma in early adulthood. My recent diagnosis at 25 years and 10 months old has been an eye opener. I knew deep down that I had PTSD; that much was obvious to me. I doubted it at times when doctors or psychologists would tell me that I had worked through my issues myself and didn‚Äôt need help with them. They simply diagnosed me with depression and anxiety and I felt that pushing for any further help was overly dramatic; clearly the doctors know best, I would think, I must just be attention seeking. Looking back, it‚Äôs such a heartbreaking thing to have happen. If I had been heard, perhaps I could have avoided even further trauma. 

The diagnosis finally came during my first appointment with a new psych; the first thing I said was ‚ÄúLook, I can seem like I‚Äôm fine, like I‚Äôve solved all this on my own during appointments but it‚Äôs a fa√ßade. I really do need your help.‚Äù

So, she listened. Two pages of notes about my trauma (and that not all of it; my mind is often all over the place and I miss some big stuff out at times) later, she says to me, ‚ÄúWell, you have PTSD, but I think you know that already.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt a gripe; it was simple acknowledgement and those words were some of the best words I‚Äôd heard in my life at that point.

She explained to me how my complex PTSD is affecting me in ways that I had never even imagined; everything is so crystal clear to me now.

I am a survivor of abuse in so many senses of the word. Childhood sexual abuse, childhood rape, childhood physical and emotional abuse, domestic violence from both my mother‚Äôs partners and my own (though that is something that I have learnt to recognize and no longer suffer it; I leave if I‚Äôm being abused and my current partner is gentle and kind, something that I never thought I would find in a man), rape as a 17 year old, spousal rape from an abusive partner, gaslighting, emotional abuse, physical abuse, financial abuse, reproductive abuse, sexual assault‚Ä¶ the list goes on. I used to think to myself that I ‚Äúloved broken men because they are beautiful in their own tragic way‚Äù. The reality is that the trauma repeatedly sent me to seek out men who would not treat me well; and it was normal for me, because it was the example I was given growing up. I struggled with alcohol for a long time, and I struggled with weed at one point too. Anything that numbed me, and gave me the ever elusive dreamless sleep I craved so much. I fought these things off eventually, and I guess I‚Äôm lucky in that regard. I have a long road ahead of me, and it‚Äôs paved with shards of broken glass. It‚Äôs going to be painful to tread, but the glass isn‚Äôt quite so sharp the further you go, and at the end of the road is freedom, and relative normalcy.

I don‚Äôt know how to feel about this diagnosis yet, I really don‚Äôt, but I‚Äôm glad to have a name for the demon on my back. Because everyone knows that once you have the true name of a demon, you can control it and you can send it back to the fiery pits of hell where it belongs.",10Jun2019,2

I'm gonna go into detail about everything I hate about my body, so be warned. I am extremely insecure about my body and so this is really hard for me. Please don't be mean. 

I have been slightly obese all my life. The type of obese where people can't tell I'm obese, but even though I just look like an overweight dude to people, technically I am obese.

My body is... Disproportionate. I have lady-like hips, the bottom half of my torso is fatter than the middle part. I basically have the body of a 40 year old overweight man, and I'm 16. My thighs are also really thick, not with muscle but with, you guessed it, fat. 

I also have breasts, otherwise known as man-boobs. They are bigger than the average 40 year old guy though, and again, disproportionate. They... Stick out. I can't wear certain shirts or sweaters because they make me look like a woman. 

My face is good looking, but that just makes the rest of my body look all the worse. 

Now, for my biggest insecurity. I have a small penis, smaller than average. At most it's 3.8 inches, when at my age the average size is 4 to 6.

Again, I find this stuff very hard to admit and talk about, so please be nice. If someone could advise me on how to fix these issues, I'd greatly appreciate it. If this dies new, then oh well. At least I tried.",10Jun2019,101

46,"Hi,
 
I have lived away from home for the past 2 and half years. I miss my parents when I am away but I also enjoy my freedom. My parents are typical Indian parents who know no boundaries, especially my father. He is of the opinion that the younger generation should accommodate the elders whether it's good for them or not. For example, I am disgusted by slimy home made butter and often gag or puke when I consume it, he feels I should eat it nevertheless because that would make my mother feel better. He also tracks my Uber or ola wherever I go, even when he knows I am only coming home in the middle of the day. Basically, he knows no bounds and he thinks its completely fine. He berates me often and belittles me constantly saying really hateful and hurtful things, which is why we don't get along very well anymore. But I do love him and I know he does too. 

Now, I used to work at a law firm in another city but have, now, decided to pursue my masters in a completely different city which would mean I wouldn't be able to come home on weekends or for months altogether. My father wants to move to that city so I live them but I don't want to live with my parents because the course is quite rigorous and strenuous and I think I would do better in a hostel where I have the space and peace that will enable me to study more efficiently. When I told him it's illogical to shift city when his retirement funds are already low and waste them because I won't be able to support him and it makes no sense for the entire family to move cities, he has gone on a rant (still on going) on how I am going to abandon them in their old age and how he wants to live with me so I can re-learn to accommodate him and his whims and how if he doesn't live with me now, I may not be able to adjust with them or anyone (I am also unmarried) ever again.

What do I do? Am I wrong and am I really abandoning them? What do I do to make this better! I wish I could just change his controlling mindset and get him to do something with his time but he refuses to! What can I do to make this better?",10Jun2019,2

48,"Recently I've been questioning myself and others about how I am perceived a bit too much. This goes for everything and everyone, is my chin too small, is my pussy too tight, am I a good listener, do you feel like you can count on me, should I wear this, etc. Everyone gets asked things they can actually answer so nw.

The funny thing is that I'm usually so happy about myself in terms of looks and personality, in general I am a confident person (possibly too confident sometimes). I do wonder if subconsciously I am full of insecurities and seek validation when I'm asking such questions. Another possibility is that I'm looking for a simple answer to all my problems; ""yes, nobody likes you because you have some armpit fat"". This would genuinely make my day lol

I sell (solo) amateur porn online, I get all sorts of compliments daily. I don't let this get over my head, but, it does make it more hurtful to know that I might have some serious issues that somehow push people that get to know me in a slightly deeper level away. This is just an example out of many I could give but I think it's a very good one. The things I hear when I sell sexting based services, apart from obvious comments about my body are about how caring, sweet and nice I am. I've heard the same from people who just met me too, and it changes a little as we get closer, not always on a negative way I would say. The other day I told my friend ""I'm very sweet, right?"" and he replied ""Not at all, but you have a very strong personality and I love it"". I guess this also represents my struggle in knowing how I am perceived a lot. 

I'm thankful for having friends but most of my friendships have short lifespans, not because we fight or ghost each other. But because the fun part is gone quickly and soon I become uninterested in them or in spending time with them. 

When it comes to sexual partners it's different but even worse, every time some unnecessary shit happens and it spoils sex, which is very frustrating, if I'm 22, attractive (this is obviously a matter of opinion but let's say enough people would agree) and can't find stability on a sex based relationship then when/where will I find it?

When it comes to family, I have a very distant relationship with everyone. The only ones I can count on are my parents but I meet them once a year ever since I moved to go to uni. I don't make any efforts on keeping in touch with the rest of my family and neither do they. I'm sure it plays a role on my questioning behaviour because I feel like I've failed BADLY on building a network of support of my own, with people I can trust and etc. This won't happen often but once I had a breakdown because there was a storm. It was pouring rain, with thunders and lighting bolts etc so I simply started crying because there was a storm and I was alone. This is absolutely irrational I am very aware I am an adult woman and the storm wasn't doing me any harm, but yeah that happened and I was scared by my reaction afterwards. 

I'm still young and approachable so it's not hard to find new people to join my social circle. But when I think of ""real connection"" and the future (when I'm 40 working on a full time job for example) I get extremely anxious because I don't want to be living life like this forever. I'm afraid I will be very lonely then and it will prevent me from experiencing some joys in life. 

Tldr; I don't know how I am seen by others and it might be affecting my social life negatively. Any advice?

49,"Throwaway, even though if someone I knew was scrolling around this would probably get specific enough to figure it out anyway.

I want people to read this. It's so fucking long and I dont even know what I'm expecting to happen if people make it all the way through, but whatever.

I don't know where to start. I hate these shifts. I work 12am-8am. There's just me my work partner and no one else. She's older, and quiet, and we tend to do our own things. Which leaves me with way too much time to think and feel and realize how much I don't fucking understand about the way I feel 99% of the time.

I'm scared to go on for too long, because I want people to read this. I want people to respond. I don't know why I want it, I just know that I do. Maybe it's the affirmation, or just knowing that someone out there, even if they're a total stranger, cares enough to stick with me for one post. Idk. Just writing that out made me feel really fucking sad and small and lonely. 

I was raised in a pretty extreme Evangelical Christian household. We didn't go to church for a long time because my parents could never ""find the right one"" (ie: not extreme enough). We went to church for a while in this married couple's basement, and then the church moved to a conference room at a local hotel, and then back to the basement before ultimately being disbanded. There weren't a lot of us, but it was pretty close-knit I guess. The ministers (husband and wife) were batshit fucking crazy. A large flock of crows has always been a bad omen as far as my parents have been concerned, but this church took it a step further. They'd tell all these stories about how Satan would send messengers in the form of crows to harrass people or whatever. There was one really weird fucking story about this addict, his truck, a crow, and the ministers using the power of Jesus to render this crow flightless (can give a full account if there's interest). There was another one about how they were at some religious convention or something at a hotel, and the hotel was renting out a second conference room to some shamanic (definitely from the Middle East - Hinduism maybe? I don't remember). According to them, these shaman witch people were turning themselves into crows to spy on the Christian conference upstairs. Because apparently they're just that important.

They were fucking creepy. 

I'm not even going to get into the weird conferences we would go to every summer with the children's ministry and the ""treasure hunting"", ""soaking in the Holy Spirit,"" praying in tongues, shaking and convulsing, hysterical laughter, and hysterical crying (among other things).

Then they started homeschooling me from grade 8 and on. All I learned from that was ""fuck you Ken Hamm"". I also had a water tubing accident when I was 14 (i think?) that fucked me up. My parents never told me the truth about how I didn't technically do enough to finish school after that, because I couldn't handle it. They just let me believe that I had graduated. My mom also didn't submit transcripts for us. She decided that it was a better idea to fucking make 'portfolios' that we could hand in if we ever wanted to go to university (i guess it's legal here?). I asked her about transcripts or my portfolio over text because I want to go to school for social work. She conveniently 'misplaced' a lot of my schoolwork. That's when I finally learned that I'd never done a full workload to complete the equivalent of grade 12.

Their attitude towards sex and virginity and marriage fostered a lot of extremely negative thoughts about sex and my self-image, and naturally occurring hormonal longings throughout my life. I'm 23 and I'm just starting to unravel a lot of it now. I didn't know until last week just how much it had affected me, or in what ways.

I also learned that I was transgender (FtM) in my mid-teens. At 16, I had a notebook full of lists of things I would need if I got kicked out. Things that I could carry around in a backpack if I was stuck being homeless, and how much they would cost. A list of resources. The steps I would need to take to get on my feet. I came out when I turned 18. Left a letter under my mom's pillow the day I 'graduated' and went out with my only non-religious friend. We said we were going out for coffee. I didn't plan on coming back. She started spam-texting me the next day demanding that I come home to talk about it. All it was was a fucking screaming match for 3 hours before I walked away. We met up a week later because all of us were invited to this wedding at we wanted to make it ""less awkward"" to see each other there. When we parted ways, my at-the-time 7y/o sister started clinging to me and screaming for me not to leave. She was crying and hysterical. 

She had no clue why I had left so suddenly. She, my second-oldest younger sister, and younger brother had all been at my aunt's while me and my parents were screaming at each other. My parents didn't tell her why I was just gone one day. I feel sick and I hate myself because they probably felt like I'd just abandoned them. 

I haven't seen any of my family for almost 6 years.

My mom has also been dishonest about my medical history. I know there were weird things that happened to me health-wise when I was young, and I think they've followed me into early adulthood. But I can't give doctors a good enough medical history to really do anything about it or know what to test for. All I know is that when I was little - probably from around 2 up until around 7 - I would have these spells of terrible vertigo. From 2 until idk when they would occasionally result in me fainting. There was some weird blood sugar stuff from right before puberty. Possible already deteriorating mental health. Possible autism or some other neurodiversity. 

And now I'm just... stuck. I have too many emotions and too many thoughts and during the day sometimes I'm fine. But when I'm alone like this, in the quiet, it consumes me again.

55,"TL;DR When I was child I raised like a boy. I was physically abused and kind of raped by a boy friend so I started to hate boys. Then I loved and dated with a girl but she didn't show me love and she left me for a man. I don't trust women emotionally and I don't trust men physically. I don't know what is my real sexuality.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was child, my girl friends are less than my boy friends. I could have girl friends, but there were few girls around my age where I lived. And these girls were introvert than boys. I wasn't introvert. I was very social and talkative and sporty and absolutely friendly. 

So I always go outside and play with outside guys (they were always boys). I really get along well with them. I can't say I was girly because I was raised around me boys and so my toys and my clothes are boyish. In this time, I always want to be a boy, my short hair was made me handsome boi lol. But I was fall in love with my best friend who is a boy (we were kissed many times but meant no sense). I had girl crushes too, in school. 

And when I'm with boys, my behavior always become girly. When I was with girls, my behavior always become boyish..

Then one day, I physically abused and kind of raped by a boy friend. We were not so close, but sometimes we spent time together. I was liked his touching etc but I didn't want to have a kind of sex. He was strong than me and I was under a pressure. Then I started to not to talk with him. And I started to hate boys.

When I was teenager, I still hate boys and I always reject when a guy asked me out. Also I was afraid of to be used. My all friends became girl and I become more girly, shy. Sometimes my behavior still becoming boyish when girls around me. I had a girl crush and I had a girlfriend but she didn't show me love like I did and she left me for another man. 

I was dreamed wet about girls so many times. But when I saw a guy in outside, I can like him and dream wet about them too. But in real life, I don't want to get close physically with anyone. I'm just afraid I don't know. And I want to live my life with a man, I don't think i'll get along with girls in emotional way. I think a man can love me more but sometimes I don't believe that because I was used by a boy. 

I think I cannot be a real lesbian because I was raised around me full of boys and normally I act like I'm boy. And I cannot be a real heterosexual because sometimes I like girls and dream wet about them. Also I cannot be a trans male because now I'm so girly to everyone and I'm ok with my gender, I don't want to be a boy anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as if i'm lying if I say it, because they're alive and well and within a 5 hour car journey to me. But they don't wish to see me or hear from me, they don't want to know how i'm doing or if i'm coping well, what my plans might be or how my day was today. It feels as if I don't have parents; it would take some weight off my shoulders if I could just say 'Oh they moved away and we didn't stay in touch'. That's not a bad way of putting it is it?

&amp;#x200B;

The reality of it all is that every parent has a reason for abandoning their child, I just think it's not a good enough reason. 

My mother- i'm not sure what to say. Either she or me has mental health issues that have lead to our relationship being damaged, or we both do. There's nothing more to say, i'm dead to her and I never get to see her.

My father- he's just unhappy I turned out like his brother. His brother, Nicky- he was diagnosed with autism at a young age and in the words of my father 'has never worked a day in his life'. When I suddenly stopped working 2 years ago because of depression my father gave up there and then and didn't want to know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason i've ignored letters from my doctor to go to autism assessments is because I know it would anger my dad. He told me don't be a Nicky, don't end up like Nicky. By ignoring those letters I thought maybe life would steer me down a different path, it made no difference.

... Today is one of those days where I simply have nothing to do. I've skipped from putting TV on to random video games on the PC to taking the bin out and making sure the flat is tidy. Went to a friends and.. I guess it's part of the reason that made me think and think and create this post. I was at my friends for less than 10 minutes before he asked me to do a favor for him, I go to my flat and he rings me as I get there and tells me he'll ring me in a couple hours to come back down. ""Okay cOoL"". He obviously never rang back, he just didn't want me there. Like my parents don't want me there. It's sad.

73,"I (F/29) started doing keto a little over a month ago and lost about 10 pounds so far. Yay (but), every Saturday night I do a cheat meal after a workout in the morning and fasting until then. That cheat meal can be whatever I want which has been something I really look forward to. The weird thing is that although I look forward to it, I feel like my happiness decreases every weekend. I always seem to be in a badish mood leading up to the cheat and then I feel like shit Sunday. I feel lazy, moody, and I have low motivation to do anything.

This weekend I not only had a high carb meal, I also got 2 buttercream cupcakes to eat before than. I have a major sweet tooth and have keto friendly desserts always on hand in the freezer when I have those cravings. I was hoping that my first bite into this vanilla buttercream would taste too sweet and I wouldn't like it, but oh my god it was the opposite. It felt like the life force was coming back into me and all I thought was NOTHING can replace sugar...And I ate one with one left that I was going to take come. Fast forward to dinner and I had two pina coladas, fried calamari, and lobster pasta. I was so full of good food but I felt sick.

Sunday I had the worst cramps and I felt really low. I was on the verge of crying all day and then finally started to cry and just laid in bed feeling lethargic and sad. Even through feeling that way, I made fathead dough pizza for dinner and had the leftover cupcake. Even though I was sad and full I still kept eating. I had cramps all night and got the worst sleep ever.

Today (Monday) I always do yoga in the morning but I was too tired and still had abdominal pain so I slept instead. So I'm typing this to get it out there and say yes, I messed up this weekend, but also wondering, how can I fix this? I know the best way to get over a bad cheat weekend is to just get back into it, but how can I not get ""the weekend blues""? I can't imagine not ever eating my favorite foods, but I also don't want to get depressed. During the week I have so much control, but it seems to spiral on the weekends.

Any advice is helpful. Thank you for reading.

TLDR; Started doing keto a little over a month ago, but every Saturday night is a cheat meal. I end up feeling depressed on the weekends when I eat/drink whatever that night. Wondering how I can not feel sad or if my cheating method is wrong.",10Jun2019,3

77,"A few months ago I've met my best friend's friends. It's been all good, we have fun playing online games and all. Sometimes we even hang out in my best friend's house.


There's this guy who I play the most with (almost every day actually) games like GTA Online. It's been some fun playing with V (We'll call him V).


Then one day he says ""I've got a friend that he used to play this game but then he quit, etc... He's from USA. Do you mind if he play with us?"" and I said that I'm okay with it. I've got friends from all over the world and I can communicate pretty well in english (our main language is spanish). Besides I would never say no to such an offer, more friends = more fun, it's all good.


So he starts playing with us. Barely talks because he doesn't know me and it's normal for people to be shy at the beginning. I've known him for around 2 weeks, and the first week was like this. When V wasn't around I would try talking with A (Let's call him ""A"") and play with him. 


V had told me that A was a little weird but... I've known a fair share of weird people and I've seen lots of weird shit, online and in real life. It's veeeery hard to make me uncomfortable/weird me out so I don't mind at all! Everything's fine for me.


But for some reason that got stuck in my head. How is that he is weird?.. So my curiosity led me to talk with him. Know him more so I can consider him a friend too and see what he's interested in, etc..


Then this is when things start to feel... odd...

It happens that A is a girl. V didn't know this. A is way older than us. V didn't know this. Basically V never ever got to know her.. And I thought ""Oh so V is that kind of online friend. He only plays and that's it"" (which is fine. Nothing wrong with that. I'm the kind of guy that likes to be a little more personal and know the person behind the screen).


A day after we had a nice chat and know eachother more, A begins to say things when V is not around, that makes me... uncomfortable. Strong sexual hints. Straight up sending me texts like ""I really want a big hard cock pounding me against the wall"".

Now let me tell you, normally I'd follow that game but.. The fact that she's a friend of V (whose V happens to be the friend of my best friend) it makes me uncomfortable to do an act like that because I don't really trust in someone who I just met a few weeks ago and she might embarass myself later. So yeah.. I don't ignore, but I also don't follow her ""game"".


But then for the next days she keeps going with those things, and sometimes calling herself a bitch, which I always replied with ""No, you're not! don't call yourself like that"" on which she would not listen to me.

 Then one day she just.. starts sending me porn. Furry porn. Then I had a ephifany. She's not calling herself a bitch like that kind of woman... She's calling herself a bitch like a female dog.


(disclaimer: I'm totally fine with furries. I don't really understand their sexual view on it but I still respect their kinks and all of that. That I understand: People have different likings and in this world there's place for everything. I've also known furry people before. That's not the weird thing. The weird thing is her actions towards me and V. Let's keep going)


This is when things start to feel weird.. She sees me online for a split of second and messages me. Sometimes spamming me more with furry porn videos, gifs, images, etc..



""Maybe she has a crush on me"" I thought, but that's not really the case. She also does these things with V. She says sexual stuff to V like she did to me, but I haven't seen her being that explicit with him.


Now, another thing that I have to put up with now: One day she asked me ""how come you never call me?"" And I'm like ""I thought you didn't want it. Also V is not confident about his english so he doesn't like it"" (I know that about V because I have another american friend who I used to play PUBG with, and whenever he joined our group, V was just quiet)

So I call her.. then she mutes the mic. So while I speak she types. Normal thing, I've been there, I'm a shy guy too.


Then V sends me a message telling me if I'm up to playing anything when he comes home from work and all in all I tell V if we can be on a call all 3. A says it doesn't matter if we speak spanish.


So we did, and everything was cool. But then.. The next day same thing.. And the next day... And the next day...... And I'm not comfortable with someone silently listening to me talking.. And even less when she publicy says that she's masturbating while listening to us... Or telling V that she's going to rape him because of how cute he sounds.


Now what is really bothering me is the fact that I don't get to play a game without giving explanations as to why I'm not playing with her, calling her, get spammed with furry porn, get spammed with very explicit sexual comments, etc...

If I don't talk with her, A sends a message to V telling him if I'm upset with A. Which V asks me if there was anything wrong with her, and I truly don't wanna be rude... 

The fact that she's clingy makes it way worse than it is. And I can't really say ""Hey, stop that."" because then she'll tell V that I treated her bad. After that I don't know how V will react. She's a friend of a friend, which means I treat them with respect because I value more the friendship of my friend who's closer to me, than her friendship.


Anyway, I wanna play a game without being bothered or bombarded with furry porn or any other sex related stuff. Games are my favourite hobby after a long day of work and this is making me not enjoy the moments...


Oh and there's one detail that it kinda stings too. I feel like used until V comes back from work. Because if I have to be pushed aside after he's back, she will do it without a problem. 


So yeah.. I felt like I had to get this out of my chest because, as stupid as this all sounds -and inmature too-, it's annoying me in the only few hours I have for myself.",10Jun2019,0
79,"Just a reminder. Must be obvious to some people but to me, I always associated loneliness as a bad thing. I was in a physically and emotionally abusive relationship for three and a half years.

In the next 30 days, I plan on improving areas of my life that I felt were diminished by weed. The main thing, for me, is working out and getting back in the gym. I also want to read more books and have less screen time. Overall, the goal is just to become the best person that I can be (or at least a start).

The last time I took a break was a few months ago and it lasted **5 DAYS**. By the time I reached the 3rd day, I was already beginning to get cold sweats. I'm not too worried as I've gone 2 1/2 months without it before, but It's still going to be tough.

 The next 30 days will be a battle. Hopefully, I'll come out on top. Wish me luck!",10Jun2019,29
81,"I'm new to Reddit, but I've heard that most people on here give some pretty good advice, so here goes.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been having body issues recently, not about weight because I don't exactly have any weight at all (kinda too skinny...). 

I hang around men more than females so I don't exactly understand how the female body works? So I have some questions for the women of Reddit, or the men who know the answers to these questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is breast/body acne normal? I have some and none of my girlfriends ever mention it, I don't know how to get rid of it either. My entire family is white and I'm the only colored female here. They don't really know how to help with my mixed skin type. I don't know what skin products are good for me, or what order I should use them, every time I use a product from them it damages my skin. My colored girlfriends all have smooth skin and don't seem to have a problem with acne, am I doing something wrong?
2. I'm a bit concerned about my body weight. I'm basically skin and bones and you can see bones in areas that make me really insecure. I try eating but whenever I eat more than one meal I get nervous and my hunger disappears. I'm lucky if I eat two meals a day and my energy levels are very low. Sometimes if I stand long enough, I get dizzy and light-headed. I hear ringing in my ears and my chest tightens and I can barely see the world around me until I sit down. I know I'm not eating enough, but I don't have any motivation in myself to keep eating. If anyone has advice on how to feel encouraged enough to eat more, please tell me. I want to get better but I don't know how.
3. Back to the acne thing, does anyone know of face creams to use? Or routines to help my mixed skin? I've always gained more acne on nearly every product and I don't know what to do. I have really oily skin and I don't know how to prevent it.
4. What's the best way to get rid of body hair? My hair is pretty thick, and is very hard to get rid of. I'm too embarrassed to ask anyone I know.

&amp;#x200B;

I know these things are kinda weird to talk about, but no one in my family knows how to deal with it, I don't have enough courage to ask my friends because they look so pretty and perfect. The only time I feel confident is with makeup on. I hate makeup, it makes my skin feel weird and I hate the way it feels, but it's the only time I feel good enough to socialize.

Sometimes I get so insecure, I won't leave my bed for hours. I know my brother is worried about me when I act like this, but I feel so alone. My mom gets awkward when talking about the female body and doesn't know how to handle my skin type. I have no guidance on stuff like this, I know this post is long, but if anyone here can answer even one of these questions or take the time to read this, thank you so much.",10Jun2019,7

With the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency fever running high, big leagues are making their way into crypto Samsung, Facebook and apple. There is no doubt in the fact that blockchain is future technology. 

Norway-based telecom giant Telenor is hoping to reap the benefits of blockchain technology, after partnership with Hubii and starting blockchain based cross-border remittance service in Pakistan; Telenor in now moving towards Africa with another blockchain based project Cajutel.

Telenor is increasingly focusing on strategic partnerships to help it market its products faster and more cost-effectively as part of a renewed strategy. The telecom giant hopes to improve the lives of one billion people and halve its impact on the environment.

The new CEO of Telenor, Sigve Brekke has announced that the company planned to invest over 100 million in Guinea-Bissau‚Äôs economy through direct investments in Cajutel Sarl, a Guinea-Bissau based Telecom Company building telecommunications infrastructure, improvements of mobile phone internet to serve individuals a more affordable and reliable internet service.

‚ÄúTelenor‚Äôs investments will be oriented toward satisfying user demand. Over 50% of infrastructural investments will go toward the development of network‚Äôs capacities, the internet and other services, as well as in innovations‚Äù, he said in an interview.

The second thing, Brekke said, is the need to do strategic partnering ‚Äúto build platforms for our industry to enable that digital-first society‚Äù.

As such, Telenor unveiled Major partnership ‚Äì with Cajutel ‚Äì which it says will allow African providers to ‚Äúsignificantly reduce‚Äù the cost and complexity of Internet at scale.

Telenor will work with Cajutel, with an initial investment of worth 30 Million to develop infrastructure to provide solar powered 4G internet to the residents of Guinea-Bissau, both will work in a ‚Äúunified‚Äù way for customers in West Africa. Collectively, Telenor will invest $100 million for expansion of their network in neighboring countries.

West Africa's internet is way too expensive and slow which makes it hard for people to adopt internet technology for commercial use, Guinea-Bissau a country with more than 1.9 million, and 120,000 Internet users as of Dec/2018, 6.1% of the population while 1,634¬≠¬≠,822.00 mobile subscriptions. The country is looking for more affordable and reliable internet to increase its penetration within the country, this a lot of room for growth for internet service providers. 

Brekke, said the telecommunications sector in Africa has not been fast enough, flexible enough and has not listened enough to its customers to play the pivotal role it should play in building an ""inclusive digital society"".

He added that the industry needed to ""do a lot more sharing"" to improve network coverage and performance, especially with the amount of data consumed by 2025, which is expected to be 200 times greater than today.",10Jun2019,0

Looking back on the three years we spent together, I‚Äôm really not surprised that it ended, I behaved appallingly quite frankly.

But that still doesn‚Äôt take away from the shitty things he did to me. Specifically emotionally coercing me into having an abortion when we accidentally fell pregnant. Us getting together and our entire relationship was born purely out of guilt over having made/persuaded me to do that. He had basically told me he really loved me, he definitely wanted kids with me and that would all be within our future, but that we wasn‚Äôt ready right now, it would drive a wedge between us and we‚Äôd be poor and have no lives. 

Queue to us splitting up and he basically confessed that he never loved me, he just felt so bad about what he did and how much it messed me up that he just wanted to give me what I wanted but had eventually got to a breaking point and couldn‚Äôt stay with me any longer.

 He then carried on fucking me for another 9 months despite my fragile mental state, knowing I‚Äôd take any bones he threw me. Until he met the new girl and had no use for me anymore.

He literally just cut me off and went public with her. Just about every damn day since then I knew that the day he actually had kids would break me on some level.

I'm not amazing, but I think I do okay for someone who only got their certificate in October of last year. But dear god, this one group is stressing me out. I actually remember being in a physics class at school, one of the last few classes before the exams, and the teacher stressing out because he was asking some pretty basic questions and people seemed really unsure about the answers. I can now empathize with him. I've spent the last two to three months covering different uses of the present perfect with this group, and we've done a fuck-ton of exercises on it. Today, we came back to class after the break, and nobody in the class could tell me how to form the present perfect when I asked. I told them the present perfect is going to be on the exam. I said the exam was covering units 11 to 16, and went through the book pointing out that the majority of those units focused on the different uses of the present perfect. I even went as far as to explicitly say ""if you don't know how to form the present perfect, you will get zero on those parts of the exam,"" because it felt like my point wasn't hitting home. Even then, I felt like I was talking to a wall, like they just didn't give a fuck. I don't know what's going to happen.",10Jun2019,4

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‚Äòyou make me sweat, Darren‚Äô and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‚Äòwtf‚Äô she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt got a boyfriend you know, Darren‚Äô and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.",10Jun2019,6

I have 2 close friends and a ton of acquaintances, but I obviously can‚Äôt be with them 24/7.  

I‚Äôm okay with my self confidence, I have no significant issues with myself that I think cause me to hate being alone.

I try to do things that I enjoy, but when I‚Äôm not doing anything in particular and have time to stop and think, I get filled with anxiety and I get really lonely. I think I feel the need to be around people so much to avoid that feeling. It comes even when I‚Äôm doing something mindless like cooking or laundry and it‚Äôs really bad when I go to bed. 

Lately I‚Äôve been studying for finals, but I‚Äôve been slacking bc I can‚Äôt focus on my homework when I‚Äôm alone. Instead I‚Äôll ask a friend to hang out. We‚Äôll have a great time but it‚Äôll inevitably end and I‚Äôll be left going home to an empty room AND late assignments.

94,"Get your tissue ready. 

K so, currently I‚Äôm in the military. MOS school to be exact. Here I live with 2 other people in prob a room half the size of an average American master bedroom.  I started up classes last Monday I think? I wake up at 4:30 sometimes as early as 4:10 in the morning. We do PT then I come back for a seriously quick shower. I then leave before my roommates ever wake up (they‚Äôre in MAT platoon aka marines awaiting training) so they haven‚Äôt picked up classes and they get to sleep in till 645. 

After PT we go get breakfast and then classes all day till 6in the afternoon. We get 2 hours to ourselves. Lights out at 8:30 and yep. 

Today was a particularly horrible day. Downhill after downhill. I kept thinking to myself ‚Äúwhat I wouldn‚Äôt give to have one day back in my civilian life‚Äù which was, wake up at around 5, drive over to college, class till 7:30 go to the gym, go home and sleep till like 11 then class again. Sometimes I‚Äôd go to the gym again right before going to sleep. 

There‚Äôs 3 things I really loved/enjoyed about my day. Nvm4. 1. Driving. Holy shit so much driving. 2. Gym, I miss the gym so fucking much. 3. Feeling hot. 4. Classes. (The good kind not this shitty ass kind) 

Another side story. So, I used to be ridiculously obese when I was younger. Throughout high school I struggled to lose weight but during the summer of senior year-freshmen college i lost it all. I used to dress so bad p much like I was homeless (I had depression shh) but idfk what happened but turns out I always knew how to dress. Like damn I turned heads. And here I feel so effin ü§Æ like shit they even cut my hair -.- when I fixed myself up I went to visit my teacher who had helped me so much in high school. It was right before I was due to ship off to boot camp. He walked right past me and didn‚Äôt recognize me. I had to tell him who I was for him to realize who I was. Same thing with my other teacher when I went to translate a teacher parent conference. Kept staring at me trying to figure out who I was till near the end she was like ‚ÄúOOH!‚Äù and I was like ‚Äúyep‚Äù lmao. Legit the proudest moment of my life was when I got this one compliment. I was walking up some stairs at my college and I bumped into this girl and she was like ‚Äúdamn boy you‚Äôre hot‚Äù then here I am now üòê 

ANYWAY.. back to original story. So, the highlight of my day now is when I come back to my dorm/room? And my roomate comes in and he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúHEYYY!!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen you all day!‚Äù Or ‚Äúhey, you‚Äôre back!‚Äù Etc. Then I‚Äôm like ‚Äúuh what‚Äôs up? You seem too happy to see me‚Äù he‚Äôs like ‚Äúof course, I haven‚Äôt seen you all day, I missed you‚Äù

It's not the best, and it's not making me much money. But it's still something. I am learning things while I declutter the house. After losing my job, this still beats gaming all day and doing nothing with my life. I have also skipped sleep many nights while I do all I can to make my baby blossom. 

I'm so sorry I can't be your chore boy, or show up to your job site on time. I do chores around the house, just when you aren't around and/or sleeping.

101,"I don‚Äòt know what a normal eating behavior looks like

One of my first posts and english is not my native language.

So as a kid i was never overweight or fat, but also never skinny. I did do sports but I never eat healthy. I almost exclusivly eat meat if possible, avoided carbs and veggies as much as possible and besides that loved snacks and sweets.That worked for the most part and I never really got bullied for being not skinny. 

But when I got turned 10, I stopped playing sports. I was diagnosed with a infection in the bone underneath my knee, was two weeks in hosptial and 6 weeks on antibiotiks. I just wasn‚Äôt motivated enough to get back in shape and play with my friends. I found an interest in videogames and so didn‚Äôt see the necessity in playing sports. 

one year later the same shit happend again. Two weeks hospitalised, 6 weeks antibiotik. I never really thought about my body. I was never comfortable with it, but also never hated it. I just existed in it. But then that was also around the time i got in middle school. A new class, I only knew my bestfriend. The whole class consisted of fit and athletic people, except for me. I was the only chubby person. Keep in mind I still was never overweight, but was at the top of the curve for normal weight and thous was still fatter then most of my classmates.

The nicknames came in to play, I was the fatty, fatbag (Fettsack), the cripple. It didn‚Äòt help that I didn‚Äòt know how to behave in front of other people. I was an outcast.

That was the first time I thought about my body and how disgusting it was. I hold that up until summerbreak. I visited new york that year. And a day before returning to europe, I saw a video. It was from Jaiden animations. Her one video about anorexia, the music video of ‚Äûempty‚Äú. It clicked, I need to be empty only then I will be normal like the others. 

I eat almost nothing for 2 months i lost in 3 weeks 6kg. But I didn‚Äòt see progress. I gave it up. Returned to my old ways of eating, until that year. I looked in the mirror and saw a ugly, fat monster. I couldn‚Äôt and still can‚Äôt stand what looked back at me. Its just a glob of fat. 
So I did the only logical thing and eat less and less. My daily intake was by 600 kcal a day. I measured everything and what i couldn‚Äôt measure i wouldn‚Äôt eat. I cut everything in as little pieces as possible and chewed until it desolved. If i eat too much i purged it up again. I lost almost 6kg until I realized that this isn‚Äòt healthy.

But I have now a bigger problem, I have no Idea what healthy eating is supposed to look like. My Family is underweight or overweight so there is not much help. 

I am now 14 years old, weigh 56kg, am 170cm tall and still are wayyyyy to fat. But I am ashamed of what I have become and thous will never seek help. I just don‚Äòt know what to do anymore",10Jun2019,1

103,"**TLDR at the bottom.** Spent way too much time writing this up as a comment on a post to just let is die in a sea of comments so here it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally I hate the act of gift giving on any standardized holiday or event. Birthdays, nope. Christmas, extra nope. Weddings, nope nope. Baby showers, nope I'll pass. 

Now let me be clear, this is not just *the act of me giving someone a gif*t, but also *the act of receiving gifts*. Hate them both. I've more or less formulated the stance of if I wouldn't buy you this on any random day, with no event or date on the horizon, and it didn't genuinely make me think of you (or that you had to have it) why you or I have to spend our hard earned money on something just cause someone put a date on the calendar. For the past 5ish years I've been pushing my family away from gift giving during the holidays and it really does seem like it has made the holidays more enjoyable for everyone. This last holiday season was the first one where none of my major family holiday gatherings, except one, had any kind of gift exchange which is saying something since I had 5 in total that I attended. Though just as a statement the 1 that did I opted out of the gift exchange so I got nothing and gave nothing, and no one cared but it made my experience all the better. Quick side note before I rant about a few specific event types, I do support giving children gifts during holidays and birthdays cause they don't know any better. Society, mainly their parents and family, have trained them to come to expect gifts on these events and they won't understand that why they stopped getting gifts at family events was cause Uncle Anon made a compelling argument to not give gifts and everyone finally caved so they wouldn't have to listen to the same soapbox rant for the 6th year in a row. Now to my issues with the following events:

* **Holidays and such:** I think giving gifts causes more unintended consequential feelings than it is intended to. Growing up, I'm sure others can relate to this, I would receive gifts from extended family or people that didn't really know me that I didn't really want or would have no use for. Now if something just showed up at my door today that I didn't want I could just dispose of it. But when someone hands it to you and expects you to like it it really sucks to look at it and to just not want it. I hate lying to people, so it never felt right or good telling my family that I like something or was glad to receive it when I am never going to use the sports bleacher seat cushions they bought me. And even if it is something that I want it still is blatantly aware to me that they had to go out and spend their own money on something so that they would have something to give me, when I would rather them spend that money on their own bills or on themselves. It just sucks all around.
* **Baby showers:** Oh baby showers, how I hate the. This is one of my more ""demented"" views on things (according to my fianc√©e). I think baby showers are 100% an excuse for the parents to get free shit from family and friends. To me its basically a ""hey come give me free stuff so I don't have to be financially responsible enough to fully provide everything my baby needs"" event. Now before you think to low of me (not that I care), I am not looking down on people who genuinely need help getting the things the need to raise a baby. I see nothing wrong with grandparents buying a crib for the baby cause the parents can't afford it, or getting other help to stock up on diapers and clothes. But once you turn it into an event you are basically announcing that you expect everyone who shows up to help you pay to raise your kid via clothes/toys/diaper/etc.
* **Weddings:** Basically the same outlook as baby showers except you just want free shit. I was vocally ecstatic when my best friend's wedding invite showed up and it said ""*No gifts please. All gifts and or money given will be returned to gifter.*"" And they followed through with it. 

All that aside, I do want to stress that I do enjoy giving gifts to those I care about. I buy cool tech stuff for my dad all the time whenever I find something cool he would git a kick out of. I love surprising my fianc√©e with flowers and gifts whenever I see something that would make her smile. And I send my friends stuff all the time that I know will make them laugh or they would like. And they all do the same for me. But I don't want some random thing I won't ever use from my family members I see once, maybe twice, a year and I don't want them to have to worry or take the time to go and get something. Just hang out with me, thats better than anything else you could get me.

On the topic of expensive gifts. I am personally fairly well off for someone my age, I lucked into a series of really good jobs right out of college and don't have any crushing debt at the moment...ya know aside from college loans which are ever impending and a soon to be crippling standard in the current US. I digress. But I am able to afford some nice things for those around me, I won't get into the exact details, however I ***always*** take into account how the person I am giving something might feel if I give them something expensive. The people I generally but things for are financially stable and take it as a nice gift (aside from one friend still in college but he can shove it and accept the games I buy him cause I just want him to be able to play with us), but I do have some family that are not doing so well, so I try not to flaunt my being alright in their face. I try to spend more time with them rather than buy them anything they don't really need, and help where I can in ways that won't be taken wrong (or at least I think won't be). For example, one of my siblings doesn't do so well for themselves but I really enjoy spending time with them when I can so I invite them to dinner and to movies and such when I can and pay for it as a ""I invited you so I'm gonna pay"" ordeal. Now that may sound kinda scummy but I do genuinely believe in the notion of if you invite someone to an event you shouldn't expect them to pay for it or their part unless that was discussed before hand. Just my way of being polite though I don't expect the same in return.

Not sure if all that made sense but my TLDR really contains my short and sweet point. Now for this to get lost in the sea of comments.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** The act of gift giving sucks all around. People shouldn't be forced to buy gifts for one another to satisfy a social convention.",10Jun2019,4
