There's some context to Pokemon btw.

Personally I don't think he was trying to be mean to the others. I interpreted his opinion as more of ""Venusaur fans who disparage people for liking Charizard are mean and toxic people"" and less of ""people who like Venusaur and Charizard are stupid"". My interpretation could be wrong but that's what I thought when I read that post.

And also I feel like the comments are barely even addressing the OP's argument.

3,"This post was originally supposed to be about me feeling useless but kinda devolved into me talking about my shit schooling, I’ll make a part 2 soon that gets to the point more.  
  
I’m a 15, 16 in like a month, year old boy from Australia. I spend my free time on reddit, youtube and video games, one I play more than others is call of duty (this might seem like cod focused post but it’s not). I feel like I’m never good at cod, I’m better than the average player, but I just can’t play online more than maybe a couple of games a day. I rarely play that much, maybe in the past but not now, because even if I want to play it takes some persuading to convince myself to play. More likely is 3-5 matches a week if that.  
  
The thing is I’ve been playing cod for years, I’m too young to have experienced some of the greats when they came out so my first game was dumpy old advanced warfare, although I’ve played a fair bit of some earlier games’ offline co op with my “nephew” (it’s weird, he’s the same age as me, actually ~a month older, we’re basically cousins) and I *loved* advanced warfare, it was so fun, so bright compared to the seemingly dreary games before, it had literally the best graphics of any game at the time and all the futuristic stuff was and still is so cool to me. I was great at aw, right up until the end I was consistently placing first on the leaderboard. Then black ops 3 came out. Bo3 is the game I play now. I own infinite warfare and have played a not insignificant amount of it but I agree with the general consensus that it’s crap, WWII seems ok but I’m not interested enough to pay for it, and not much in this world could make me buy bo4 since it’s just a slightly crapper version of bo3 but they haven’t fixed the microtransactions and other dumb shit and the pubg ripoff but it actually runs this time mode isn’t enough to redeem them. But anyway I got my mum to buy bo3 for me way back in late 2015 when it came out and I didn’t really like it, the online mode at least, the logic defying drug trip that is the bo3 campaign is strictly alright.  
  
The first thing was that it was just different to me. The guns and jet pack were just not as sharp and tactile. Aw was piercing and punchy and bo3 just wasn’t. Aw was kiki and bo3 was bouba, is the best way I could describe it. But at the time I couldn’t play aw because I could not find a game at all. There is no way of telling how many people are online on aw as far as I know but I swear there were like 3 people on. You never could find a game in anything other than bog standard team deathmatch in aw but at the time I couldn’t find a game in *anything*. I honestly can’t remember what happened next. I’m pretty sure I just didn’t play either game for while and just did something else. But eventually I got back on and played. Again I can’t remember much of this but this all leads up to the present day.   
  
Now I feel like I’m a similar if not better skill level than my aw days, but I perform like absolute dog shit. I’ve had some great plays in my time but those are few and far between nowadays. I just keep getting absolutely destroyed by other players. The main reason I believe this is for is because of skill based match making. The game takes data from your plays and sets you up with the best it can come up with. The problem is that, in my experience this creates a flip flop effect where you’ll switch every few matches from a state of pure euphoria where you are John Wick, and hell.   
  
If I do bad then I get placed with bad players that, like me, are getting like 2 kills and 18 deaths a game. At this point I turn into John Wick and destroy these people and get like 30 to 15 a game. The game sees this and puts me with better players and then I get my ass handed to me and the cycle continues.   
  
It is pure torture to see someone in a room, running for a door on the side of the room. They don’t see me. I’m using the best gun in the game for the circumstances and I know it. I aim and fire, but since the game slows down your turning speed a ton whenever you aim, every single one of my shots misses, he then proceeds to turn around and kill me in less than a second when I am shooting at him yet not one of my shots hit.  
  
It is at this point where I feel like an empty waste of space and want to give up on everything. Things like this happens in most of my firefights when I’m the hell cycle and make me want to stop with shooters all together. I can’t stand doing this but then I see people like ImMarksman say that gamemodes other than search and destroy are low skill. This wouldn’t bother me so much if he just said this alone, but he backs up what he says with proof. I have seen this man get a 60 I think kill game to demonstrate how low skill these game modes are. He got a 30 kill streak and didn’t even notice.

I always want to be the best, or at least good enough to be recognised as one of the best and be put higher than the vast majority of players. I know that sounds unrealistic and I don’t always expect to be the absolute best at every little thing, nor do I not understand that these things aren’t just handed out on a silver platter and require hard work to get. *I get that*, but in this and a lot of other things in life I am slowly losing the hope to believe I can become one of the best at *anything* significant.  
  
Ive never really known what job I want, in primary school (grades 1-6 for the rest of you) i was told that if I work hard and get good grades I will be able to be get a good job and be rich. I trusted the people that told me this and believed them when they said it. So I worked pretty hard in school and got very good grades as far as I can remember. I never really liked school or schoolwork but powered through it with hopes of getting a good life eventually. I aligned myself with a certain type of student that I’m guessing many of you know of and is fairly common, so much so that it’s kind of unbelievable that there isn’t a word dedicated to them in particular. I’m talking about a students that are good at school in certain way. They’re good at schoolwork and get good grades, they try their absolute hardest to do the “right” thing under the teachers’ eyes, they don’t mess up with schoolwork or behaviour at school out of pure fear of disappointing teachers/parents and ruining their reputation. To these students schoolwork and good grades are everything, *everything*. But most importantly, they *resent* slackers and other sort of “bad” examples of students. And *boy* was I one of those students. (The good grades ones not the slacker ones)  
  
I was good at schoolwork, terrified of failing my teachers and parents, whom I pretty much treated as gods at the time, and *boy* did I *hate* the bad kids. The type of kids that didn’t care or try, were generally childish (I mean who can blame them at that sort of age) and usually more interested in enjoying themselves than doin school schoolwork. “What a crime” I know, but for some reason, at the time I just hated their guts. What didn’t help was that I was bullied to high hell. I mean not really, it wasn’t like some the horror stories (not literal horror stories I mean) about kids that were bullied that were basically abuse and assault, but they called me names and tried to get me react since for some reason the got joy out of how hysterical they could make me, and otherwise were just generally wankers to me. This made me hate them more and when my mum and dad would constantly repeat to me something along the lines of “don’t worry because it’ll all be worth it when you drive past them in your expensive car and they’re alone drunk in the gutter” it didn’t help with me thinking I’m above them simply because I devoted so much energy to being an exemplary student.  
  
This continued on for a while, always sitting in the back of my head - the truth, that I hated school. Over the years I got further and further from my almost religious idea of a perfect student. I would get into fights when I couldn’t handle the bullies anymore, try less at schoolwork and just generally drift away from who I was in primary.  
  
Then highschool rolls around (7-12, we don’t have middle school in aus). Years 7 and 8 were where I really started to disconnect from that weird type of example student. My friend circle has evolved a little since primary, still the same type of example student, just in primary it was me and 3 other boys whereas now(ish) it’s like 10 ish people, around equal boys and girls. But as I was saying I started getting distant from this, honestly cult type of mindset. I hated English and history and general humanities subjects more everyday. My work got less focused and I started to fall behind in homework. Being behind on homework lead to my first ever “”””detention””””. It wasn’t really a punishment per se but more of just an “ok let’s just get your homework done in lunchtime since you didn’t do it”, but irrational old me did *not* see it that way. For me it was *huge*, remember I’m still an example student, what also devastated me more was that all of siblings as far as I know finished school without a hitch and all have great jobs for themselves now, I even asked my sister who said she basically went through without getting into much trouble. I was extremely disheartened by this and hated that I let this happen. I was so concerned with being a great student, it was crazy.   
  
I remember also, a little after I got the *absolutely horrible* detention sorted out and I was on the straight and narrow (kinda not really tho) another teacher ran into me and told me I missed a detention with him (I’m pretty sure he was just mistaken and I’m certain I had no detentions at the time) naturally this *fucking shattered my world*. I went over and found my teacher for English who gave me the first “”””detention”””” since he was pretty much the only person that would’ve had a reason to give me one and *with tears running down my face* I asked him what the deal was and why I had this *gasp* detention out of nowhere. He, as he should’ve in this situation, just calmly said something like “what? No. I never gave you a detention what’s the big deal anyway?” And I just sorta continued on with my life after that.  
  
But as I was gonna say before I went on a tangent about me overreacting over a detention, I started to realise a lot of the stuff I was learning was not that important, some of it blatantly useless and most people, instead of giving an actual reason for why things where the way they where, would just give me “reasons” like “deal with it” or “that’s just how the system works, so you have to do it”.  
  
At around grade 8 I actually started to think for myself and not just accept that “this’ll be good for me”. I started realising that a lot of this stuff that I’m being taught isn’t an essential life skill, nor was a lot of it particularly useful. A little more importantly, I began to not care as much about what teachers think of me, and was less and less scared of doing the “wrong” thing everyday. But most importantly by far, I started to realise that I’m not above others for being good at school, and one’s self worth can be tied to other things.  
  
In grade 8 I finally started to not want to do work, I still did it most of the time, but I was far less driven to do so. In English and history, both of which were with the same teacher in the same room, I was kinda actively protesting what I was doing by saying stuff every now and then about this work is unnecessary/stupid. It wasn’t the best way to put it and came off as very cringy more often than not, but I would occasionally bring up some good points in a manner that wasn’t that bad but it was met with usually indifference/quiet, passive observation from everyone else, and “stop being a smartass” from the teacher and my example student friends.  
  
This was all good and well but shit really kicked off in grade 9. Around that time I just sorta decided to give up on English and history as a whole, I mean what we’re they gonna do? Kick me out of school? What I would do was come into class, sit away from my “friends” who I was hating more and more every day, and just refuse to do work. Just sit in silence and do nothing for 70 minutes, more than 5 times a week, every week. This upset my new teacher a fair bit, which is actually easily what I regret most about doing this. She was new to the school, I’m not sure if she was new to teaching. She was the typical hot English teacher, but she got really offended by my refusal to do the work. She really took what I did to heart on a personal level in a way that I never intended to make it. She viewed it more of a “my lessons in particular are what he hates” rather than me hating the entire subject and not just her. I even made her cry once which a couple of the girls got upset at me for and angrily told me to go out and apologise which I didn’t do (the going out to her part, I can’t remember if I apologised to her about that incident in particular.  
  
Last year, 2018, grade 10 while I was still at school (it’s the school holidays now so I’m not at school) she would come to my friend groups table while she was on duty and have a chat with us occasionally. When she would do this it was astronomically different to our lessons the year before, since we could talk and I wasn’t in this state of I hate this and hate these lessons. At those times it was much more chill and I was able to talk to her in a normal sort of way as opposed to the lessons. During times like that I actually started to respect her much more. I’m pretty sure I apologised about how I treated her and tried to explain to her that it was a much less personal situation than she thought. I’m not sure if she really understood where I was coming from but it was something. As I grew more distant from my former friends I would tell her when she asked how I was going that I hate school and I hate these people (my friends) and my friends never really got bothered when I would just offhandedly say I hated them since they probably didn’t care or look too far into it, and they were smart, they knew I wasn’t like them and hated being around them and just listening to their conversation, but when she heard me say that she just be understanding you know, and would just react in a rational way and see where I was coming from. I really regret that I didn’t get taught a different subject by her because if I did I feel like she would’ve been a pretty good teacher.  
  
But yeah, school has been shit for me, I understand that my choices have not helped me but I can’t just sit there as I spend 10+ hours a week at some points in my schooling where I just sit there, wasting my precious, ever depleting, finite time alive, doing nothing to help me, or make me happy.

5,"I’ve always felt that offering someone help, advice, support and complimenting them is so rewarding. Knowing that you have managed to positively impact someones life, state of mind is such a warm, satisfactory feeling.

So, why do people get enjoyment out of bringing others down? Especially people they don’t know. I have my theories but I want to hear others. Why are people so obsessed with tearing others down in an attempt to make themselves feel better? Surely, having a positive impact on someone is 1000 times better than dragging them down.

11,"My dudes. I am 23 now. I recently saw something that reminded me of how stressed and confused I was 18. When I graduated high school, suddenly the pressure to keep up with my peers, which I'd never given much thought before, was unbearable. I was afraid of my peers leaving me behind, or everyone figuring ""it"" out and not me, and it always felt like the clock was ticking down too fast.

There are a *lot* of people looking to capitalize on the weakness people feel in this time, and I fell for a few while I gradually built a (more) stable sense of self over the past five years.

I come to tell you what I'd tell myself if I could go back. It's just for dudes because that's all I've ever been and all I know anything about.

**The People That Tell You You Can Be Rich And The Envy of Your Peers**

You won't have the highest social status in the world. Some people you know now are likely to achieve more than you. It's fine. This is fine without rationalizing that it has to do with circumstances and that it doesn't reflect on who you are as people or what you are capable of. Some people are smarter than you. Some people at the fork in the road will sacrifice and risk more than you. It's ok.

You can put as many superlatives as there are together and they still won't add up to a human being. If you lean on a self image that uses a phrase like ""the best at..."" or ""very good at..."" you put yourself in a vulnerable position when reality threatens that belief. You may be resentful of a new friend in your social circle who knows your area better than you, instead of being excited to share an interest and learn together. You may avoid pursuing good opportunities for yourself because the rejection or failure is terrifying. You may find yourself making irrational decisions in your life chasing evidence of the threatened belief even when it's obvious to someone whose mind is not maimed by this craving that you are behaving self destructively.

You can smell it when people are distracted by a trial in their head, defending against an accuser imagined or real calling their worth into question. The wrong people will come, armed with overpriced self help books, get rich quick schemes, multilevel marketing scams, or just toxic rhetoric that validates your worst perspectives so you can blame someone.

**The People That Tell You You Can Fuck A Bunch of Bitches With This Technique**

If you find yourself stressed by all the messages about how you should be or feel some anxiety because you think you'll be left behind in the dating market, alone on some island while your peers are running their own harems, congratulations you've had a basic human anxiety many men have had one point. It's normal and the best thing to do is let it pass and move on. But if you don't know that's a normal feeling and you focus on it until it grows and occupies too much real estate in your mind, people looking to profit on your desperation will tell you they know how to make sure *you're* the one running the harem in their $12 ebook. People resigned to the same desperation will tell you all sorts of things about women from ignorant to gut wrenching and dehumanizing. Also they will try to sell you so much cologne.

About this process I'll say this: if you want to get better at an interaction with a party whose perspective is different from yours, try to balance your diet of information by consuming *mostly perspectives from the other party*. You already know your perspective. You know it really well because you fucking live in it. What's really to gain by reading about women from the perspective of disenfranchised men or men trying to sell you ebooks and cologne? Listen when women tell you about their life and perspectives. Hit up /r/twoxchromosomes and read women's perspectives on not only dating but just the world generally. Read books by written by women. Over time it should become obvious just by doing that dating not a game to win, women are not trophies, they have many of same anxieties and struggles you do, and that things work out better for all parties including yourself if you look for genuine connections (i.e. it not working out is also a successful outcome if you understand each other) with other people instead of trying to get a specific behavior out of them.

**The People That Tell You What You Feel and Are Isn't Legit**

You will come across people who call you out for what they think you are. Are you a white man maliciously oppressing minorities with your votes even though that thought never occurred to you? Did someone tell you were sexist because you commented on a woman's body even though you think that's just a compliment and people are too sensitive now?

In reaction to such things it is easy to do a scan of your own brain, find no offending intent, and dismiss the criticism, or (more likely) engage in some defense of yourself because you're afraid there might be something to it and that makes you uncomfortable. People can drift too far into a victim mentality and calling you out may be a channel for them to exercise an unrelated experience and you don't need to reevaluate your life when this happens. But it *is* up to you to give it some thought before making that call because often we can do something wrong without realizing it. If you think the person is sincere just be like ""Hey I haven't thought about much; that can you tell me more so I can consider it?"" That's a 100% reasonable response.

Society affords a lot to men just based on the penis that it doesn't to women. Most notably that most narratives you'll encounter unless you specifically look for others will be from men, so it's very possible for what you thought was a comprehensive flow of information to inform your vote just straight up omitted the most common perspectives of women. Maybe every discussion you've heard about the ethics of commenting on women's appearance was with your friends or on some forum with mostly men, which is a poor diet for considering the ethics of this particular situation. In cases where someone calls us out, I think it is our responsibility to put effort into understanding and revising our behavior *if necessary*.

**You Have Everything You Wanted And You're Still Not Happy**

There is just a tangible limit to how happy shallow things can make you. Say you finally got what you thought was your shit together and your mum is proud of you. It'll be a fuckin ride for a few months!

But there will be something missing, and that persistent nagging feeling that you're wasting time, or that you need to fix something to feel happy, won't go away. Maybe you blame your job or the city you're in. Maybe your friends just aren't quite like the ones you had as a kid. Maybe it's that side passion you've been neglecting.

But it isn't any of these things, not alone. There is no magic job that will make you happy, no magic relationship that will quiet the ache inside, no magic hobby that will finally close the gap between you and a wholly fulfilling life, no perfectly comfortable arrangement that will assuage the discomfort inside too.

I believe in my limited experience that this feeling is dynamic, sometimes caused by something as simple as having bad sleep or too much to drink the night before or something as serious as knowing that the relationship you're in is doomed even though you haven't said that in your internal monologue yet. But in the cases where it is something to re-evaluate and change, it has been one of these two things for me, over and over:

1. I am suppressing my feelings somewhere, such as procrastinating a breakup.
2. I am at the point of diminishing returns on the material to happiness graph and it's just not high enough. So I have to find some human things to make up the rest. Usually I do this with long term volunteering commitments because when I did it with a relationships it was overkill, fostered dependence, and lead me back to the drawing board worse off.

Well this guy happened to find me and pursue me. Normally, I’m not into being pursued - I like to be the one on the chase.

25,"I just want to share this story with somebody, so I think here is as good of a place as any.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of backstory first: During my first year of college, I became best friends with ""the girl next door,"" literally the person who lived in the dorm room next to mine.  We just clicked perfectly and got along so well.  Near the end of that year, we confessed our feelings for each other and started dating.  The relationship ended after less than a year, and I was heartbroken in a way that I hadn't experienced before and haven't experienced since.  Even so, I think I learned a great deal about myself, relationships, and the world as a whole thanks to our relationship and the breakup alike.

&amp;#x200B;

About three years have passed since that breakup.  During these three years, both of us have graduated, each of us entered a serious relationship with someone else, and each of us has faced various successes and setbacks.  For the majority of this three year period, we communicated very little, even though I found myself thinking about her sometimes.  That is, until this past fall.

&amp;#x200B;

In August, I received an unexpected Facebook message from her -- pretty much just asking what I was up to after graduation and how my life had been.  We chatted for hours.  I learned that she was working in a temporary position overseas with plans to attend graduate school, and was in a happy, long-term relationship with someone else from college.  I told her that I was working on grad school and job applications of my own, and I had exited a long-term relationship of my own a few months prior.  It was great to catch up with her and rekindle our friendship, as I had forgotten how much I enjoyed our banter.  

&amp;#x200B;

For several weeks, we exchanged occasional, friendly chatter.  One night, however, she came to me seeking advice about issues in her current relationship.  I listened and helped as well as I could.  Afterwards, she hit me with something totally unexpected.

&amp;#x200B;

She asked if I wanted to be flattered, then told me, ""you're literally the best boyfriend I've ever had in my life. If I had to describe my dream person you would probably fit that description. It's all downhill after you lol. But that's not how life works, dream people aren't realistic""

&amp;#x200B;

I was floored, because I felt so similarly.  In that moment, I was able to play it cool and joke it off, though i did express to her that she had sort of defined my ""type"" in terms of dating.

&amp;#x200B;

In the days following the conversation and even now, a few months later, I feel conflicted.  On the one hand, we have always gotten along incredibly, and I think she is just a fantastic human in so many ways, and I miss a lot of things about being in a romantic relationship with her.  However, I recognize that neither of us was totally happy in our relationship -- not to mention that dating now would be nigh impossible (she's on the other side of the world and we will likely never live near one another again).

&amp;#x200B;

We continue to chat casually every now and then.  For the most part, it's random musings and jokes, but we have done some reminiscing about our past together.  I think we both know that things won't ever be that way again, and, personally at least, I'm afraid that things would turn out the way they did last time even if we were to somehow date once more.  Still, I'll admit that I sometimes catch myself fantasizing about what could have been and what could be.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: An ex, who I had become friends with again, told me that I was the best boyfriend that she'd ever had and ever would have, and that I'm basically her dream person, and I feel similarly about her.  She's an ex for a reason, though, and getting back together isn't really feasible, but I can't help but feel some longing.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, sorry about the wall of text, but thanks for listening!!",07Jan2019,1

She was the wife of my best friend, and she was amazing.  The two of them got me and my wife together, and the four of us raised kids together.  She beat cancer once, and it came back to finish what it started.  She pushed through the holidays, not letting on how bad it was to anyone, just to give her kids that last Christmas and New Year with their mom.  One of them is young enough that he can't possibly understand what's happening, another is old enough to know exactly what's happening but not know what to do with it.  Both of those sweet kids don't have a mom now.  And their dad is going to be raising them alone now.  It's not fucking fair and I know there's absolutely nothing I can do to make it better.  He'll get through this, we'll get through this, but I also know that she was half of him, and on top of losing this wonderful person, we're losing half of him, and I don't know what to do.  I doubt there is anything, really.   I don't know how he hasn't broken already.  If I lost my wife I can't imagine going on.   And all of this I'm writing is cliche, trite, inadequate, static.  None of it matters.  This is all just a thing we do because of the things the world around us does.  None of it matters?  All of it matters?   These words don't matter, that much is certain, if anything is certain.  And nothing is.  So I'll leave them here in case they matter somehow.

35,"I don't feel comfortable telling anyone in my personal life this right now. But I need to set the thoughts free or it'll wear on me.

- I'm uncomfortable with emotional intimacy.

- I can't demonstrate that I can feel love.

- I feel worthless to the people in my life, my emotional intelligence is low, and I have little to no sense of humor. I have a dull personality and I view this as a negative trait.

- I feel like nobody deserves to be saddled with me.

- My natural inclination is to run away from others, since getting close to people makes me uncomfortable, but I crave rewarding social interaction as a human need. The friction between these two things is causing me stress.

- I feel like I have no redeeming qualities that would justify my being in other peoples' lives.

- I feel like a cheap toy. The most I can do is give material or shallow comfort to others. Reason isn't as useful to people as love. So I'm not useful. I feel expendable and not having much worth.

41,"So, I’m a teenage girl. No boyfriend, pretty heavy social anxiety. Recently, I’ve been able to kick off a lot of it and my anxiety has improved immensely; I went from not being able to high five people for fear I would miss to ordering at restaurants for myself! It’s been pretty awesome. Something that has come with that, though, is that I find myself becoming overly bold or confident at random moments. And I’ve noticed that a lot of my super-talkative-extra-peppy side comes out whenever I talk to guys.

Today I was in an Uber with a female friend, our driver was a male a two years older than us. And I just could not. Stop. Talking. Or maybe that’s just my anxiety saying so, because I’m pretty self conscious about it. Since I’ve realized that I change when I meet dudes, I’ve started to take note of what happens. My voice becomes higher, I talk more, I try to be overconfident and come off as someone who is fun and playful. Ding ding ding, even as I was sitting in the Uber I knew this was what was happening.

After we got out, my friend turned to me and said “stayawesomes, you really don’t know how to act”. This is a joke, a reference to a meme that goes “girls don’t know how to act when ...,guys don’t know how to act when....,” etc. I know she didn’t mean any harm, but when she said it I just felt like someone punched me. 

I hate how my personality changes when I’m around men. I absolutely hate it. I feel like I’m being one of the most annoying type of girls out there and it’s embarrassing that it happens even when there are other girls around. I don’t want to be one of those girls who become too much when they’re around a guy. Most of the time I’m not even attracted to them; it just happens, even if they’re my friends. And I don’t know how to fix it! 

I’ll be going to college soon and thinking about making friends that might see me as a ditzy girl when I talk to guys makes me so anxious. I tend to be a very reserved, chill, quiet person, but when I’m in the presence of males I ACTUALLY “don’t know how to act” haha )):  .

42,"I’m struggling currently with being lonely. I’m sure everyone goes through this at some point but I’m mainly looking for solutions and advice from people who have been through it, and people who have come out the other end for better or worse. I’d like to hear your story. 

I’ve been in a serious long term relationship before where I felt deeply connected to the person and I felt like we really had a shot at long term happiness together. I felt he couldn’t really hold up his end of the relationship, I was carrying the bulk, and felt that it was time to move on and hope someone would come along that had more to offer and was willing to work on issues when they arose. 

Simply, the relationship proved to me that I am a great partner in a relationship and I have what it takes to make a long term relationship last. Just need to find the right person. 

Since then, I’ve mostly been on my own. I’ve dated briefly but nothing concrete and nothing I felt like pursuing further. 

I got stuck in a weird friends with benefits at one point just to kill the sting of loneliness I felt at night in bed. It only made things worse because I always left his house feeling empty and wanting more. I felt like my self-esteem took a nosedive after I ended that relationship, about six months ago. 

I have always had a sense of independence. Never really felt the need before to be with someone else. I had a shitty upbringing and had to take care of myself from a young age. Because of that I take great pride in being able to support myself emotionally and financially. I’ve pitted friends of mine in the past who struggle when not in a relationship because I’ve always flourished on my own. 

Until now. I just want to be held. It’s an overwhelming feeling. I’m also at a crossroads in my life where I feel like now more than ever I could really lean on a significant other and our relationship to get through these tough times. 

I’ve really never felt this way before now. I find myself eating ice cream in my bed at night watching Netflix alone and wishing that this wasn’t my reality. 

How do you get through these terrible feelings? I want my sense of independence back and I don’t want to feel incomplete. I feel like this is taking a toll on my confidence and self esteem more than ever before. I’ve had a tinge of loneliness here and there but this is a different level. 

I’m sure a lot of responses will be along the lines of be more social, find hobbies, join a club, therapy, learn to be alone. I personally already actively participate in these things. And in the past I’ve been single and perfectly happy with my life, just not now. I’m just looking to find that sense of independence again and to shoo away the loneliness and the feelings that come with it. Is it because of my age. Do we get more anxious and lonely in our mid twenties because there’s less time to find someone ? Has anybody been in the same boat as me? And how did you fix it ? And maybe subs that would be helpful for me.

Has been a pretty mellow year, both for snowfall and incidents. Had actually remarked not two days ago how lucky we have been this year, not even a single serious injury.

Today that changed (well, technically yesterday, is 4am now). We had a head on collision, which killed the driver and sole occupant of one vehicle, and left the other in bad enough shape that fire and rescue had to cut both people out and take them to hospital.

54,"Everything has been a late realization and my frustration haunts me.

I've been a straight A student ever since. My mom said that she saw this potential within me so she started pushing me to work hard to the point that I would receive physical punishments if I get exam marks lower than 5 mistakes. All my life I've been scared of getting my exam results, especially when I didn't exceed her expectations. Those years were terrible. I can still remember myself hiding behind my grandmother every time I tell mom about my scores.

I graduated as Salutatorian in primary school and was the batch's Valedictorian came high school. Recalling my childhood experiences, I realized that I took everything as a command. I had no choice and I didn't want to have a choice. I was passive and dependent. I studied just because I fear my mom, that because a lot of people expected something bigger from me. Studying was never fun for me. I have not sought for a purpose, I just went with the flow and to where life would lead me.

College happened. I made it to one of the best universities in the country. I moved in to a dorm nearer my school. Everything was new to me and I was all by myself. It's liberating, really. I thought that I'm finally free from my mom's hold, and maybe making it to a top school would suffice for everything that she would expect from me later on. 

I started to chill and to not care about my studies. I invested my time mostly on having fun and on my hobbies. My mind would roam around inside the room if I didn't like the class. This went on until my junior year. I didn't have failing marks but my grades became so-so. 

My former classmates still consider me just as how I was in primary and high school, smart and someone who would have a bright future. But no, ever since I entered uni, getting all surrounded by the creams of the crop added to my desire to ditch everything, to not be anything at all. And now it hit me. Knowing that it's already my last sem and the urge to persevere academically has just come right now. I realized that I still want to achieve. That my purpose really is to make my parents happy. I was wrong for thinking that playing around would bring permanent joy, that lying low would truly liberate me. I am selfish. Going through this also made me realize that my mom just wanted the best for me way back. She didn't mean to hurt me, and I know that she was sorry for all of that.

Now, it's too late, my grades won't make it to the latin honors' cut. I'm also scared as to how people who knows me would react after knowing that I'm graduating with nothing. Everything frustrates me right now and I have no one to blame but myself. ",07Jan2019,1

I'm a designer at work and I did my first class to teach coders how to design, started a new project and on the side I'm becoming a partner to a restaurant so that's taking a fair share of time. Although where I live it's dark as hell, it's better to be busy because tiredness is a reality no matter what.

Amidst all of my projects I found out that a friend of ours is in a bad situation: his brother (Mubaraka) has acute kidney failure. They live in Tanzania and don't have access to a hospital to do a kidney transplant. So after saying I'd help get the word out, because it seems like the only hope they have is to raise money, I learned the ins and outs of their dire situation and helped [make a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WYT-Z7sDU) with a friend to start a crowdfunding page. But that's when the problems started.  


1) GoFundMe is only valid for US residents, so I found an alternative (GoGetFunding) that requires PayPal  
2) PayPal needs a credit card, my friend didn't have one  
3) After getting said credit card (today), we find out that PayPal doesn't allow Tanzanian residents to receive money  


Due to the laws in my home country, I cannot personally raise or receive money for charitable causes because I'd need a permit that would take too long to get: we were looking to launch this campaign today so that we could move fast. Currently the family is using all their money on dialysis, for which Mubaraka has to travel almost daily for hours. The situation is only getting worse by the day.

It's such a fucked up situation and I'm at my wits end, how the hell are we going to help this dude? Did we do all this work for nothing? Do we now just have to stand aside and wait for them to run out of money and watch the guy die? I really don't know what the hell to do.

GoGetFunding has GGF Cards that would basically be able to circumvent the PayPal restriction but it would take over 50 days to get the funds and they would take a 12% commission which seems exuberant, we are afraid that it would be too late if we had to wait for two months before being able to do the procedure. Soliciting direct bank transfers seems like a horrible option because that's a route that scammers usually take and we want to be transparent and open with the journey, from funds raised to funds spent.

58,"I feel really positive at the moment. I had a shitty past, and as a result I often go through phases where I feel really low and ‘taken over’ by thoughts about things that happened. 

But sometimes I go through positive phases, like right now. What happened sucked, but *it’s over* and I won’t ever let it happen again. It’s over. When I think about the past, all I’m doing is hurting myself. Thinking about it isn’t going to change that it happened. I feel like I’ve reached a peaceful acceptance where I say ‘what happened, happened, and it was bad. But it’s over now and I can move on, making sure to learn from my mistakes’. 

I wonder if anyone else has gone through a similar revelation. ",07Jan2019,1
59,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I need to get something off my chest, so hopefully I am in the right place.

I always thought I was a nice person, kind etc, but I realised yesterday that I'm not.

Some context about me:

I don't have, and never have had, a relationship at all with my mother, she is not a nice person at all. 

I always prided myself on being a caring shoulder to cry on, looking out for &amp; supporting others and being there for my family.

I am insecure about everything; my abilities, my looks, my weight, my mental state EVERYTHING.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is an example of why I am rethinking my personality:

My sister in law gave birth about 6 months ago and was in labour for roughly 14 hours to then give birth by emergency caesarean. Obviously this wasn't a nice experience and the recovery for my sister in law took some time, like with any mother that experiences this. However, this is not uncommon. I don't know what the figures are but this happens a lot. However, for the past 6 months, I have been reminded constantly by my mother in law that this happened and it is unique that my sister in law muscled through such an ordeal. Comments like '\*SIL name\* had to do that for 14 hours you know' 'I bet that puts you off having children' etc when watching people give birth in TV shows.

I'm also reminded every time that I see my mother in law of how special and unique my 6 month old niece is. 'She has such full head of hair' ... she has dark hair and it is just as much as any other child with dark hair at that age. 'She is making all sorts of amazing noises, like she is singing' .... do children not make noises at 6 months? I'm pretty sure my younger brother and sister often kept me awake with their noises at night when they were that age.

I know this isn't terrible, but I don't have children and would like children someday with my husband, I don't even know that I can have children, so it makes me a little jealous. 

Maybe this is all because I don't have children, that I don't feel the same warm excited way that they do when they think my niece is more advanced than she is. I love children, they are so lovely, so I dont think it is a children thing, it is the way I am being force fed how amazing she and my SIL is, don't get me wrong they are amazing though, it's just the force fed bit that is annoying.

The reason this makes me question whether I'm a nice person is it highlights to me that I am;

* Easily Jealous - I'm jealous that I do not have children and that my sister in law has such a doting mother.
* Not as caring as I thought - My sister in law went through an ordeal of long childbirth and then emergency cut open. This wasn't the birth she had planned for, and yet Im hung up on the fact I keep being reminded of it.
* I don't suffer fools or those that bend the truth - My mother in law was with me and my husband whilst my sister in law gave birth. During a conversation with a stranger, my mother in law told them that my sister in law was in labour, with excruciating pain, without needing the use of gas and air, because she is a brave warrior. This was not true, she was using gas and air. Why did she need to bend the truth about this? It wasn't needed but I suppose my disappointment at the lie isn't needed either.

I also realised that I am proud &amp; stubborn, and this isn't a good thing. When I am told that I am doing something wrong I don't really like it and have a nasty tendency to sulk a bit. Perhaps it is the way I am being told that puts me in a stubborn stance, because it isn't with everyone who points me in the right direction. Is this normal? Do I need to check myself in to the mental home?

&amp;#x200B;

Another note and reason for rethink:

I arrived at my mother in laws during the festive period. I don't really like my brother in law's girlfriend and she was there, she is a little bit frustrating and a little self absorbed (Example: you ask someone in the room a question directly and she will answer as if the question was for her, no biggie but grates on my a little), she is also one of those that says she is vegan, uses chemical free shampoo etc, but smokes cigarettes?! I am polite and civil, however I have been told that my eyes give me away and I have a habit of pulling strange things with them when the woman in question does something annoying. Anyway, on arrival to my MIL's, my mother in law collars me and says, rather loud, 'You better be nice to \*GF name\*', bearing in mind that the woman in question is in the next room and can hear clearly. What makes this worse is that she finds her frustrating too, but just to embarrass me she declares my dislike plainly to all, deliberately or not. So maybe I am not as civil as I thought. Is it wrong to not like someone?

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I don't like the person I am if this is it. I liked that I was a kind person, but I am not if the above is anything to go by.

&amp;#x200B;

Any constructive comments welcome.

Last night I had a dream that she committed suicide. I was at my dad's house, my dad was there. My dad is a chronic narcissist, and does a lot of stupid shit. My little cousin was there too, though I can't remember what she was doing. I remember just talking to my dad pretty casually, watching tv, etc. Then I turned to the kitchen and my cousin had hung herself. I don't think I can overstate how vivid this part was. Her skin was gray, and she was just hanging limply against the washing machine. I started screaming for my dad to call the police. Cried when I woke up.

63,"I was watching a show on netflix and my sibling texted me to get off netflix as all the accounts were taken up and they had just gotten off of work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Was a bit bummed because of it but I remembered that I knew my gf's netflix login details, so I just figured that i'd log in and go to her account for the time being because she was getting ready for her shift soon and I'd just let her know later as I wanted to keep watching but didn't have our family account atm. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her family account also has the 5 spots available, just putting that out there, I'm not trying to use it as an excuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

I figured it would've taken too long to text her and stay tuned in to the show. I told her later in a skype call and she got mad that i did it. She said that if you'd have asked me it'd have been okay, but you didn't and then she sent a few insults my way and said ""why did you do that, it's not like you pay for it,"" which to be fair were well warranted but the last part seemed like a bit of an overreaction to me. I apologised and said that I didnt mean to make her upset about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's now just asked that I text or call her about it next time. It seems like it'd inconvenience her by doing that and I told her that but she just said to do it next time. We were in a skype call at that point and I didnt answer her because I wasn't and still aren't entirely sure why she is upset with me because of this and then she hung up.

64,"I’m struggling currently with being lonely(F24). I’m sure everyone goes through this at some point but I’m mainly looking for solutions and advice from people who have been through it, and people who have come out the other end for better or worse. I’d like to hear your story. 

I’ve been in a serious long term relationship before where I felt deeply connected to the person and I felt like we really had a shot at long term happiness together. I felt he couldn’t really hold up his end of the relationship, I was carrying the bulk, and felt that it was time to move on and hope someone would come along that had more to offer and was willing to work on issues when they arose. 

Simply, the relationship proved to me that I am a great partner in a relationship and I have what it takes to make a long term relationship last. Just need to find the right person. 

Since then, I’ve mostly been on my own. I’ve dated briefly but nothing concrete and nothing I felt like pursuing further. 

I got stuck in a weird friends with benefits at one point just to kill the sting of loneliness I felt at night in bed. It only made things worse because I always left his house feeling empty and wanting more. I felt like my self-esteem took a nosedive after I ended that relationship, about six months ago. 

I have always had a sense of independence. Never really felt the need before to be with someone else. I had a shitty upbringing and had to take care of myself from a young age. Because of that I take great pride in being able to support myself emotionally and financially. I’ve pitted friends of mine in the past who struggle when not in a relationship because I’ve always flourished on my own. 

Until now. I just want to be held. It’s an overwhelming feeling. I’m also at a crossroads in my life where I feel like now more than ever I could really lean on a significant other and our relationship to get through these tough times. 

I’ve really never felt this way before now. I find myself eating ice cream in my bed at night watching Netflix alone and wishing that this wasn’t my reality. 

How do you get through these terrible feelings? I want my sense of independence back and I don’t want to feel incomplete. I feel like this is taking a toll on my confidence and self esteem more than ever before. I’ve had a tinge of loneliness here and there but this is a different level. 

I’m sure a lot of responses will be along the lines of be more social, find hobbies, join a club, therapy, learn to be alone. I personally already actively participate in these things. And in the past I’ve been single and perfectly happy with my life, just not now. I’m just looking to find that sense of independence again and to shoo away the loneliness and the feelings that come with it. Is it because of my age. Do we get more anxious and lonely in our mid twenties because there’s less time to find someone ? Has anybody been in the same boat as me? And how did you fix it ? And maybe subs that would be helpful for me. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this I would love some advice or stories about your own experiences with loneliness. To feel less lonely, ironically.  ",07Jan2019,1

67,"So last month I got surgery to remove the plate and screws that were put in my arm because of an accident I had in 2017. When I asked the doc how resilient my arm now is with all the holes in it he said ""good as new"" the holes don't make a difference. I had my doubts. And I was right...   

It was yesterday, a third date with this girl and we were connecting great. I invited her to my place for pizza and a movie. She came over and of course I hoped after the movie something more would happen. We sat down on the couch and started talking and laughing. A couple seconds later we were making out even before we chose a movie. Awesome.
The direction this was going was pretty clear and still on the couch I started going down on her. My couch is not the biggest and I was lying in front of her pretty awkwardly so I wanted to get a better angle, got up a bit and tried to turn her around. A crack like someone was breaking a wooden pole went through the room. I was in shock I think because I just stared at her and she stared at me for a little eternity. I felt no pain but that loud crack could only mean one thing. My head was spinnig and thoughts of more surgery and ruined plans rushed through my mind...and there was her. Sitting there. Staring at me, half naked.
It took a minute then I sorted myself, took the keys and drove to the hospital using only my left arm. Still no pain but the arm felt ""wrong"". 
She didn't really know what to do because when I asked her if I should drop her of at the station she said I should decide. So I took her with me to the ER.
Two x-rays later the doc said there is nothing, he has no idea what could have caused that crack sound. Pain started to rise but I could still rotate my arm in any direction. He said after a surgery on bones they could crack sometimes. I was skeptical but since my arm was working I decided to wait till tomorrow to see my surgeon for another opinion.
We drove back to my place. Mood was getting better. I ordered the promised pizzas and we chose a movie. After a while we were vibing again and started making out again. This time though my arm really started to hurt and there was now way I could even get her pants off. She probably knew that and I don't know if it was because she was feeling guilty or she just rocks but after a couple minutes she started to go down on me... 

So yea. Arm is indeed broken (hairline crack) says my surgeon after examining the pictures. Hurts a lot now. Have to keep it still. Again. But I guess I had a date for the books...",07Jan2019,1

I used to be happy maybe it all started when i moved to this place 3 years back i have never felt so lonely and lost ever im only 19 and will be 20 in a few days but i cant handle it anymore the crying is happening so frequently and im not interested in any thing anymore i used to be so motivated to go to college graduate well get a good job and make my parents proud now its got the point where they practically think im a failure and useless.

My mother and i have a very bad relationship we fight constantly and i dont know what i am supposed to do she kind of stopped worrying about me because its a lost cause
My father has been working abroad for 25 years and its the only way to make a living i cant complain cause he does so much for me and i love him. He sacrificed so much just to provide for us and is living there alone and going to work in another country so that we live a good life here.but every little boy needs his father to show him whats good and wrong teach about life and everything i never had that he comes like once or twice a year he's retiring after 2 years and i cant wait.
My brother and I never had a good brother relationship . I dont even remember the last time we actually spoke properly if its not forced by my mother and i have always had complex issues cause he got everything he wanted. He got to choose which University he wants to go to,his own motorcycle ( which i took from him because he went to abroad) whereas me i never to be in this city away from my school mates i freaking hate it here. My father just bought a house in my name like 2 months back but i have never felt so empty in my life.
And my friends keep calling or inviting me to stuff but all i do is push them away so i can be at home doing my own shit. I cant waste my life away but i want this to stop. I dont want to die cause i know there's so much to live. I see people, people i was best friends with or still am moving on with relationships, friends and everything whereas im stuck in a bubble.
I used to be a good kid i suppose now im 19 and chain smoking does recreational drugs also chemicals from time to time. Maybe i do all these to numb the pain but all it does is increase it.and there's this girl i love so much I've been talking to her for more than 2 years without missing a single day she's my precious but again im not good enough for her so she needs more ""special people in her life"" (oh and she have a bf btw) i cant stand it.

71,"Hello!

I am 24 years old, have pretty good relationship with my SO, parents and friends. Generally, everything is going fine. The point is I dont feel like a good person and am worried that this might ruin it.

This is mainly because I am a compulsive liar (and to be fair, too good at it), both about serious and everyday stuff. Its not surprising, given my very strict parents growing up. I dont blame them anymore though parenting IS hard. However, problem is still there and I want to be better.

I lie to avoid people being angry or dissapointed even if the thing is not my fault. It is weird, because overall Im not a sensitive person, but people being angry, dissapointed or confronting them scares me a lot. 

Sometimes it happens like a reflex and causes me much trouble, because to cover small impulsive lie I lie more.

Ive been trying purposely making myself to say unpleasant truths to others, but feel like thats not enough, because if i do something bad, its really hard to make myself not to cover it in some way. 

What can I do to improve the situation and how should i approach it (i.e. trying to understand why  am I scared of confrontation)?

72,"I don't expect anyone to read all of this, it just feels better for me to lighten my chest a little..


As the title says, I really don't know what to do with my life any longer. This is, basically, my life story leading up to the point where I'm suicidal and constantly panicking and stressing over my future life. 

I'm 19, M, living in Sweden. Since my grades started to matter, all I've done is follow the current. What courses opens up most amount of doors, what types of schools should I apply for.

Ever since growing up, my one true dream was to become a marine biologist since I've loved the marine life and my whole childhood is filled with documentaries for young and old. That dream broke to pieces at age of 15, before I would apply to our version of college, when my teacher sat me down and told me how difficult it would be for me to reach my dreams profession- when my grades weren't good enough. Knowing that, I searched for other professions that would help me live a basic life and thought I'd do like my mother- and study later, once I've put my mind on what I really want. None of these ideas have held interest longer than 1 month or so.

Finishing ""college"" (it's called gymnasium here), I now am working weekly and saving up for a trip to Japan, since that was something I wanted earlier but never got around to cause I procrastinated it and always lost my focus. I always doubt these types of ""projects"" I make for myself because I always think ""is this really what I NEED?""

More so, recently, have I started feeling miserable and my will to continue is growing weaker than my self-doubt and I feel that none in my surroundings are trying to help me or even advice me. I experience it like my ""family"" actually adopted me, and never told me about it, cause none are similar to me or even trying to be understanding or genuine. Everything feels plastic and fake, just like my friends.

My parents are divorced since I've been young, so it's never been bothering me- spending time with either from time to time. They divorced cause my father was abusive towards my mother and me. But the thing bothering me is that I was a mistake. All the stories they tell of how mom and dad met are vague. All the times my mom spoken how it would've been nice to have a daughter, so she could spoil her like she'd dreamed of. She's now together with her boyfriend, who's recently celebrated being together for a little more than a year, and this is where I started getting sadder. The boyfriend has a daughter, of 3 years now, and all the attention is on the daughter and my mom's boyfriend. I don't really mind that people aren't in my face all the time, but it really feels like I'm just someone sharing their apartment. A bystander on my ""mother"" finally enjoying the life she wished for. 

I'm aware that I feel like this in periods, and am not sure if it's depression or whatever it might be. I've seeked professional help, but it never really helped me- cause I always felt forced to talk, and we never came to any conclusions (went to these sessions for 2-3 months, 2-3 times/week before I stopped going). 

I wish for a reset button. A button to reset my life, my decisions, the place that I was born, the people I've met, every single thing that now tears me apart. I long for a life, away from this place and it's difficult for me to go. It's frightening. I'm scared of not making friends, since I've grown more introverted again along with my growing misery.

I'm wish for the courage to be able to end my suffering. Having a fear for cutting myself, I've never cut myself or the similar, and I can't use the knife to end it all. The only thing I can think of now, if working my way to getting a weapons license (if there even is one in Sweden), so that my death may be peaceful.

But most of the time I'm just on auto pilot or actually miserable.

Things that other people find enjoyable like parties, being in the hot sun, concerts, etc. Are awful for me because I'm so awkward and sensitive to things like loud noise. And don't get me started on children. So fucking annoying.  

Then there's the biggest issue. The everyday bullshit I'm expected just to deal with simply to exist.

Not this time, because I understand literally nothing. It's not that it's explained badly, they've actually gave us a ton of help I just can get my head around it for some reason.

It's basically stats, and so far I've been doing fine, 80% average from the last assignments/ tests. But I can't understand what I'm meant to do for this. ""determine your choice of functional form first"" and then ""here's the choice of functional form you may consider"" but does that mean I just pick one of the forms they've already given us, or do I just use it as a base to build my own form. Like it's obvious one of the coefficients can be removed. But then I remove it and the RSS increases, so surely that means my regression fits worsely now. Or I included quarterly dummby variables and ran a Restriction test which came out as they should be included. But then their P values are fucking massive so obviously not.

I barely get out of bed a lot of the time.

I need to get a job and pay this $800, but my car is fucked and won't pass emissions. Great. So now it's going to be even harder to get a job, let alone pay to repair my car. 

I'm really getting sick of this shit. I've had such awful and overwhelming anxiety and depression, especially for the last month, that I've become such a toxic and unproductive person. I snap at people easily, I isolate myself, and I don't do anything to improve my life.

But I'm fucking trying. It's just every step I take I get set back even more and I get overwhelmed so easily. There's no one to help me or support me. I don't see a way through. I just want to curl up in a ball alone and die. 

Last night, I was watching a movie and out of nowhere just started bawling. I hadn't cried in over 2 years but I'm just at such a low point I couldn't keep it in anymore. I know plenty of people out here have greater problems than me and I shouldn't complain, but I'm really hurting here. I may be 20 years old but I'm super naive and don't know shit.

I really feel like I'm losing it right now. I barely even feel like I exist in the world, it's almost like it's a really shitty dream. ",07Jan2019,1

Been having such a problem for rather a long time recently.

About 6 months ago, I got out of a 15-month relationship in which I was emotionally invested a lot. So, the healing was quite hard, but I'm practically over my ex (we haven't talked for long, and I don't wanna take her back). Despite that, I still feel almost disgusted by the mere thought of dating someone new. I used to be a huge believer in selfless love and commitment, but since then I've basically done a complete 180 about that. I'd go as far as saying that I've become a lot more cynical

On top of that, my standards, my expectations have risen since the breakup. I won't list them all, but, in general, if I ever get in a new relationship, I don't wanna be with someone who is not at least as good as my ex.

I was wondering if anyone of you guys experienced it. Should I be concerned about my current state of mind? Or is it just a temporary thing that will go sooner or later?",07Jan2019,1

The other day I was trying to share a story about Ross Ulbricht with the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA via Twitter.

So here I was, being engrossed in the #FreeRoss campaign – having literally just finished an interview with his mom I was passionate. Angry with the ruling of giving the supposed creator of the Silk Road… Two life sentences plus 40 years.

Alright, so you know I was feeling passionate and all over the place with emotion. Well, I decided I wanted to @TheRealDonaldTrump on Twitter with a link to the story. I shared what I believed to be the article about Ross Ulbricht, tagged the president, and went on my merry way…

BUT WAIT! OH NO! NO NO NO NO!

I SHARED AN EDIT LINK TO A COMPANY GOOGLE SHEET!

AHHH!!! OH NO! – So, I hurriedly deleted the tweet! Rushed over the google sheets and removed the edit link for the google sheet. Worried that this information may have gotten out, I deleted the file and moved the information to my native Microsoft excel.

The moments after that were of disbelief that I could do something so incredibly stupid.

Well, I accidentally sent a company google sheet edit link TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA - AND EVERYONE THAT READS HIS THREADS!

What a day. lol

This whole situation made me realize how easily something like this could happen. I mean consider this, this google sheet could have had bank records, personal information, home addresses - ANYTHING. Additionally, this link would have given anyone that followed it EDITING RIGHTS! This could have been a serious professional catastrophe for me and this company. What if someone gained access and changed the records to funnel all the company funds into their account or into an anonymous account in another country?  
Really could have been terrible. Glad I re-check my tweets for spelling errors… If I had not, then this would be a post made by someone without a job. ",07Jan2019,1

87,"I've never been very confident. I always hated how I looked but as I grew older I came to terms with it. Once I started going to college, for a few days atleast, I kinda liked how I looked (don't ask me why). Today in a long time is a day where I look in the mirror and I just want to cry because of my hideous looks. I was in a great mood during winter break (mostly atleast) but my mood changes so drastically I don't know why. I also realised that I want to drop my major and do something different, that's ok though. A lot of people say I'm good at the other major I plan on studying instead. But I don't know, I don't think I have what it takes, I feel inadequate. I'll just do that because I have no clue what else I should do. I just don't know what will make me happy and what I want for the future. I always thought, and still kinda think, that marrying and having kids will make me happy but recently I've realised (and I know it sounds cheesy) that I have to love myself before I can love someone else.

88,"I live in Portland and me and my partner have difficulty finding people our age. I say *finding* because *meeting* people, we're great at. We have a running inside joke that people find talking to us to be extremely easy. But we just can't seem to meet anybody right in that sweet spot of, you know, our age bracket.

We're both 23, but most of the people we've 'settled' into since moving here in April have been older than us. We have a great relationship with a neighbor who is in their mid 30s, but we can't exactly hit them up when we want to watch shitty movies or go hiking or something. It either feels weird or schedules don't work out or it's just not something we'd want to do with someone who I could be a weird baby brother to.

Our usual networks are bad to OK as far as finding people goes. My partner is going to the local community college but her classmates are usually under 21 at this point, but at least her coworkers at a standard downtown retail job are proving to be pretty cool. As for me, I have a pretty good office job, which in the past has provided me some friends, but I am pretty sure I'm one of the youngest workers in my building, and don't exactly have an on-site team to work / hang out with, either.

This has been my first big move in my life, so I'm used to having friends close at hand, and I'm realizing how much it sucks to not have someone to call up on the weekends to see what they're up to. It's just a problem I've never had before,   
 because so many of my friends came from work or school. I think it's starting to affect me more than I ever realized. I'm not sure if I just don't know how to do the leg work of meeting people any more, or if Portland is just *weird* for people our age. It seems like I have to fit some mold but maybe that sense is what's keeping me from meeting people.

How do you meet other people?",07Jan2019,1

I try to make people laugh a lot. And try to please them to be my friends but they dont become my friend. I only get replied with one words.

On twitter i tried really hard to get 10 RTS or Likes, Tried really hard to get followers or get people to chase me,
Made me feel meaningless pointless and brainless absent minded guy.

I dont know what to say in a conversation.
I never have anythiny to say. I get stuck and hit my self when i get home.. or when online talking to girls i get mad when i get one word replies everytime...

Im mad at my self for not having unique opinions or belifies to share.. if i tried to build a good story it would be the worst story ever...

I always do the same shit... i used to play football now i barely play.

I used to be nice guy now im the mean guy... i try so hard to be cool like batman or indiana jones or Robert Dwayne Jr or wolverine or most other fictional characters.

Im the mean asshole... i feel like i dont have a personality. I feel inferior and feel cheap and low and vulgar and..

I feel like if i was in a movie i would be that character no one cares about. And he is mean to others so now others dont even care to hate him.

92,"i’m a 17 y/o female. not a great time for self confidence heheh but i’m really struggling with my image and a ton of other things too. i’ve been clinically diagnosed with depression and i do take medicine for it, but i still struggle with school because of my apathy and my general down look on life. i constantly think suicidal thoughts–more so in a joke way, like when an inconvenient thing happens, i’ll think to myself “oh better kill myself now”. but now, i’ve been thinking about it when i’m upset or lying in my bed at night or whenever. i often threaten it as a joke, but i don’t really feel like i’m joking anymore.

on top of that, i struggle REALLY bad with my body image. i’m not obese by any means, i weigh around 150ishh for a 5’5 girl. but i’m lazy so none of that is muscle, i’ve got chunk in all the wrong places, and it’s depressing to look at me in the mirror.

i struggle to brush my teeth at night because it takes too much work. if i don’t need to shower, i wont. i sit in my bed watching tv shows when i’m not at school. my room is a fat mess

there are things i’m doing to help me–for one, i have a dog i need to take care of. she’s helpful in distracting me and i love her. two, i’m taking lexapro. it does make me nauseous, though. three, my family and i are gonna get my medical issues sorted out (physical) within the next month. four, i got a job.

i think the problem is, i struggle to apply myself. i know i’m good at school and smart because i do well on tests and i got a good SAT score, but i can barely muster up the energy for showering myself, much less homework. i think another issue is that i have pretty major seasonal depression, so that’s something. i just need a way to make myself feel better

The common “wisdom” for men is is go to college find a good job at a big corporation, marry a nice girl, become a dad quickly, buy a big house, climb through the corporate ladder, and retire with full benefits.

Here is what it looks like at 40 for an unlucky person.

-you wake up at 430 am since you have to be at work by 600 and can’t afford to pay for taxi and you don’t own a car

-you quickly run through the list of tasks to make sure your child is awake and has food before going to school

-you lock the door and rush to catch the bus. You have to be early at least 30 minutes because the bus could be 20 minutes late !

- you travel the overcrowded public transport, changing three buses at this ungodly hour only to reach work a handful of minutes late... and be screamed at by boss for being late.

-you work in an abusive workplace with no self respect and are totally exhausted after 9 hours.

-you are back home to see your child back from school and got an hour worth of homework for you and the child to go over

101,"Until not long ago, I went through about 4 years of emotional emptiness due to a crappy environment and that stopped me from developing and growing emotionally for 4 whole years. Now that things are getting better I'm still left a little crippled by it in many situations, as I'm still learning.

There's this one person in my life whom I'm more attached to than I am to anyone else, but still in a platonic way. We've known each other for almost a year now so you'd think I should feel comfortable around him. Well I don't. Each interaction between us stresses the hell out of me. I'm a straight guy by the way.

The problem is that, since I care about him so much, I'm trying my hardest to make each and every single interaction between us be perfect. I plan everything I do and say to him, mostly due to fear of him suddenly abandoning or hating me if one little conversation goes wrong. I know it's irrational, but at the same time I don't. Unfortunately, being so focused on perfection leaves no room for me to genuinely enjoy his company, which really hurts me.

EXAMPLE 1:

When I want to see him at school, I won't just wait to stumble upon him in the hallway and give a casual hi and a smile. Instead, I'll go exactly where I know he will be, hide in plain sight near my friends to pretend I wasn't waiting for him and then greet him as if I was surprised to see him. I know it sounds stalky and weird, but the two of us are already quite close, so it's not a desperate attempt to gain his attention. We'd still see each other even if I didn't do that. But I can't help it. And if one day I fail at this, I consider our whole interaction to be ruined, even if it went well. I want to be able to casually greet him anywhere at any time like I do with my other friends.

See what I mean? I leave no room for spontaneity.

EXAMPLE 2:

I also have this big problem where everything I say to him is shallow, neutral and mechanical. Sure, I may smile or laugh at his jokes or give him high fives and pats on the back and chat with him but I always feel so cold and robotic. I only answer with short and robotic replies. I never mean anything I say to him, because truthfully, while I enjoy his company and presence VERY MUCH and while I LOVE being around him, I find him to be boring and uninteresting. He's very easy going but it's just that we don't really have anything in common, we don't even share the same friends group. Sometimes it makes him feel pushed away or ignored and it pains me. Other times it makes me sound boring and not worthwhile.

These are my problems. I truly want to learn to appreciate him for what he is, but my fear of losing control and being abandoned makes me try to make each and every interaction perfect, and I fail at that too. Is there a way to learn to just fucking relax around him and not fear showing affection? I just want to feel genuinely comfortable around him.",07Jan2019,1
