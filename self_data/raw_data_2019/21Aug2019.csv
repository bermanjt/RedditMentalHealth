0,For making me suffer so much.,21Aug2019,1
1,It seems like it was only yesterday that I made this account. Where have the years gone?,21Aug2019,8
3,"Had to make my selfpost because r/unpopularopinion did teh BIG B&amp;Z for a classless joke. THREE MONTHS AGO... LMFAO... If I'm banned from there, are my opinions truly the only unpopular opinions online? Anyway... 

I have been here for several years. But I only joined a few years ago. That's when I felt things began to change. Even when I stopped being a lurker, I saw some pretty bad stuff on here. None of it offended me, though. Some seem to forget nobody on here can really harm you, short of doxxing you and using your info for nefarious purposes. I know it's cliche to say people are getting too offended, but it's the truth. It may also be cliche to state they should not hold others accountable if they are offended, but that's also true.

It's all so different. We used to be the surface Internet's ""woke"" corner for those who didn't wish to join the depraved 4chan. Now that site is surprisingly changing at a fast rate as well. I went there after hearing about how messed up it is. It's just a message board site for weebs and edgelords. Not sure if I miss all the bad stuff, or it really is as cleaned up as it appears. Basically Reddit's bad side on a larger scale. Nowadays, if someone is hurt by what you say, you can't say, ""Walk away from your computer and the cyberbullying solves itself."" No, now you must offer up a feigned apology and hope they bite.

Of course, a lot of the reason behind why Reddit is becoming more ""safe,"" in its own regard, is because it's basically now pushed across the site as Reddit Law. Mods on every sub are now notorious for the ridiculous rules they have put in place. This sounds a lot like what the other social media websites are doing, except it's even worse. With the others, you just can't post anything ""bad."" In the case of Reddit, you have that weighing on you, plus any other random rule a couple of guys decide you must follow. We come on here to escape the forced order of the world, not deal with it twofold. I can't count on one hand, two hands even, the subs that have banned me for reasoning stretched so thin it doesn't even exist. Meanwhile, they never seem to be around when I've noticed worse users.

This policing pushed by the mods, and even other users, is a horrible abuse of power. It is not our job to know every rule of every sub. Especially when none of them ever share rules, for some bizarre reason, and the average Redditor may join at least 50 subs. Half of my posts are removed for the dumbest reasons. When they link to a previous post, it never matches what I wanted to say. While we're on reposts, they happen all the time and mods clearly can't stop them all. They just want their power trip. News flash, if my post partially resembles another, just keep in mind nobody has ever had a fresh thought in hundreds of years.

Now let's take Facebook as a model for comparison. I have seen countless Redditors state how much they can't stand that site. Many are converted, much like I was. I quit it because it added no value to my life, short of ""dank memes."" Everything else made me feel bad about myself. Yet Reddit's becoming more like it every day. All posts are becoming policed now. The only popular subs all mimic Facebook with the posts that seem to go viral. Those with polarising views are either shut down by others or outright removed/banned. Now Reddit has its RPAN thing, much like Facebook has its own Live counterpart.

Users are now sharing photos of themselves, choosing one as a ""profile pic"" even. Whatever happened to the snoos being cool? They are attempting to personalise an account that should, for all intents and purposes, be anonymous. If you want to make an ass of yourself while having the world know who you are, there's a site for that. We call it Facebook. I do not fear people in my life knowing what I say online, but I still appreciate whatever anonymity I feel I have. Nobody cares who I am anyway. Let the mean jerks on here think they are safe in their own way while using the Internet.

If all of this continues to go downhill, I can see myself leaving another site. Only YouTube comes on top as the social media site I prefer, and it's because of their database of videos. I love what Reddit used to be. It has always been one of the most popular sites around, yet because it wants to be the very best, it will only implode upon itself. Sites like Facebook and Twitter have a system they follow. Reddit basically took a single look in the mirror and said, ""Well, let's make a bunch of changes to appease everyone."" You can't make everyone happy, and in trying to do so, you will not only make more people pissed, but will even lose their respect.

Thanks Reddit, I hate it.",21Aug2019,1

5,"I am stretching when I say ""Majorly"", but I just said that 'cause it's not like we're just avoiding the use of plastic and some stuff like that.

We are collecting all the trash whenever possible every day, and this weekend we will go on a walk on a place here in my city to plant trees and collect all the trash we find (there's quite a lot). It's our first time doing this and we're planning to do this constantly, like weekly or every two weeks.

Also, I'm putting challenges on myself like ""If I'm able to do this, I'm going to do something like plant a tree or make a huge number of searches using Ecosia"" (If you don't know what Ecosia is, I'm going to explain in a minute).

I've never planted a tree before and have no idea of how this works, but I'm eager to be able to do this as soon as possible. When we're done with everything, I'm going to post a picture here on Reddit (If everyone on the group is comfortable with it).
I encourage every single one of you to do the same, and if you don't have time, money, or patience, you can just simply help the world by using Ecosia.

Ecosia is a search engine just like google, it's actually really good and similar to google, unlike these terrible sites like Bing. The twist is that for (around) every 45 searches you make using it, the team behind the app will plant a tree. You can download an extension on Chrome (and if you want you can even download a Dark Mode of the extension, just remember to download both), or download it on your phone. C'mon, please, don't be ignorant, it's REALLY quick and easy, you'll not be losing anything, ya know? It's not like there's a downside, it's literally google but eco-friendly.

I am really proud of myself and my friends, and I hope this turns out pretty well.",21Aug2019,6
6,"I’ve never had a problem getting attention from men...yet I’ve always focused on my imperfections. I’ve never given myself credit for the wonderful things about myself...even when I’ve been jealous of other women it’s because of their appearance not any of their talents or personalities. 

I’ve had issues in every relationship because I never appreciated myself and always longed for what I DIDNT have instead of realizing what I have to offer. I don’t have big fluffy breasts, I don’t have perfect skin, I am not naturally flexible, I have thin hair, I have ugly fingernails, I don’t have big hips....all of these things about myself kill my self esteem. But I am not measured by what I do not possess. 

Objectively...I’m fucking rad. I’m fit and healthy as hell, i pay my own bills and make a solid amount of money only at 25, I ride motorcycles, I’m the best photographer i know, I’m creative as hell, I’m a deeply thoughtful and respectful partner (and just a cool ass girlfriend), I’m extremely sexually empowered, I volunteer, I love animals, I’m a great listener and friend/daughter, I’m adventurous and fun, I have adorable dimples and naturally athletic figure. 

I’m amazing in so many ways and everyone is fighting battles you know nothing about. No one is perfect and everyone has insecurities. I’m just starting to realize this in my life that everyone has something going for them and even if I don’t have that specific thing it doesn’t mean I am unworthy of loyalty and love.",21Aug2019,3
7,"My friend knows I'm dealing with my own issues but constantly texts me about her own. I generally don't like to put my problems on people, but if I get in touch with her in a particularly bad way she will act available and will listen/answer the phone, so it's not entirely one sided. However I feel like I talk about my issues maybe 10% of the time, whereas her depressed vents rear their head every other day. 

I've tried a few approaches in the past - one was blunt and filled with resentment. Another strongly but sensitively suggested that she find a professional as I'm limited for what I can take on. Both approaches ultimately didn't work. Finally, I ghosted her, which worked for about 2 weeks until we started speaking again. 

I would rather not lose her completely, but I'm so resentful at this point. Especially since she knows that I struggle with my mental health on a daily basis.",21Aug2019,10
8,"I've felt this way for a while but I have trouble having a discussion about it. When I think of myself when I'm in a really bad position or a really good position or any position of live for that matter I know that the next day will be different. And I will feel a little differnt way, have differnt things happen, and have differnt thoughts. I know it sounds like such of a basic idea but if I think about it the highest point of my life could be tomorrow in theory and the lowest point in my life could be right before I die. 

It really makes me wanna just life in the moment because I know that I dont know when I'm gonna die and I dont know when things are gonna get better or worse.

It also makes me know that I cannot cling to a beautiful moment or amazing realization, it has to be let go because theres more days to come.

Even this realization of the way of life needs to be let go of in order to actually live",21Aug2019,3
9,"I have two book ideas and I really want to start writing.

I have a PE license and an accredited degree, and am not worried about job security.

10,"I am certified in first aid and last night I had to use it. My boyfriend got a moderately deep cut about three or four inches wide between his eyebrows and I almost threw up. I was visibly shaking, lightheaded, and sweating. Does anyone else experience this?

11,"I met Steven sophomore year of math class. I don't know how we have to start talking, but we would talk casually as friends. I'm not attracted to this guy. He also doesn't take the best care hygiene wise and is overweight. .
He dislikes most black people and stereotypes them as ghetto. He also said racist stuff against immigrants. Also, anti-LGBTQ.I don't hold these views. 




My senior year, he hinted about asking me to prom multiple time in our history class. I told him I'm not going (which was true), but he should ask this other nice girl. Decline because I was interested in a guy who had graduated and we had talked since I was 15 names, Tim. We have different views on a lot of things one time he said it's okay to beat your dog when they misbehavior.


I talked to him about some of my issues because I thought we were just friends. I always made it clear I would never date him but encouraged him to ask out other girls or try dating apps. He always acted like he was stubbornly in love with me like we were the perfect match. We graduated four years ago; I live i a different state.



I open up to my guy issues with him. It's only usually Tim because besides one other guy when I was 18, he's the only guy I've seen on and off. He was and still is terrible to me. Used me for sex, used me to cheat (I didn't know about the girlfriend ).
I


 cried to Steven a lot about it which his response is ”well of course when you go after douche bag pretty boys you get treated that way” he's also tried to say why won't I date a kind guy like him because he listens to all my problems and we joke. I've wanted to say we're not compatible, and I will never feel that type of way.




He’ll also say things to me about starting a family, and that will make me truly happy. I NEVER want to be a housewife I don't want kids besides maybe fostering kids I just had issues growing up as a kid and teen. I don't feel I could ever be a parent, even working on these issues. It hurts when he says that to me because sometimes think about having a kid but know I could never be fit and cry.



One day He was going at me again about how we are a perfect match, and we make each other so happy. I told him back no, that's not what I want. He kept asking why I said we're not compatible. 




He kept pushing why and the reason. I just flat out said I don't find him physically attractive. He again asked why I said ”I don't know what I find beautiful” I don't want to point out flaws to people. He kept pushing for how and why I don't find him physically attractive. He started calling me a coward because I wouldn't answer his question.
I just said weight and facial features like the nose. 



He left me on reading. He texted me two months later I told him to stop contacting me he asked why I said I didn’t want to talk to him anymore and I said I’m blocking him and stop contacting me He said, “hit me up when you’re sane again.” I blocked him, am I the asshole?",21Aug2019,1
12,"So remember the presidential election in 2016? Hillary was well in the lead until literally days before the election when the FBI was investigated Anthony Weiner for sexting a minor. Anthony’s wife who was an aide to Hillary Clinton had texted him about Hillary’s private server when she was Secretary of State and this caused her to come under investigation again. 


Sooooo because a congressman married to the aide of someone running for president was sexting a minor the presidential candidate lost the faith of the community and narrowly lost the election.

14,"I’ve had a very difficult year for a number of reasons. Last night I finally had a talk with my ex  after four months of no contact and it gave me some much needed closure and made me feel like I could finally move on and maybe even be her friend some day. But then today I sent a text following up, thanking her for talking, and I suppose I may have tried too hard to elaborate on what we discussed and how I was feeling. Nothing outrageous, but I guess more than she cared to hear, as she has declined to respond.

I know I shouldn’t care what we she thinks of me now, it’s really part of what will allow me to keep moving on. But it’s just so frustrating that I finally felt like I was approaching some peace of mind on the matter, and now I just feel that familiar mix of hurt and embarrassment. I just want to stop thinking about it and I feel I blew it with my neurotic compulsion to reach out and say more.

All of this in the midst of a challenging job search and various other personal issues.

17,"Disclaimer: Apologies for any grammatical error as English is not my native language. Angsty brooding meets assignment task. 

In the kingdom of Prex, good fortune is said to be blessed upon those who worked hard enough to gain a position in society. Those who are not worthy of achieving success are regarded as failures to the culture that has been built by our forefathers in the previous century. As the smallest village existing within the boundaries of the kingdom, Salve is known to be prosperous in introducing a wide range of prodigies and intellectuals to be granted affluence by the higher social order as a default.

Therefore, I believe that if I work hard enough to earn a living for a family of three, surely it is sufficient from the sacrifices I have made during the early years of my life. As the potential candidate of being the most well-known merchant around Salve, I, Erica Allerie, will be successful in gaining the position from the fruits of my labours. From morning until evening, I give my very best in order to make the village a thriving place for everyone to be involved with the business around the local areas.

My co-workers will see to it that a place for me is well deserved in the upper class of Prex. I shall provide with the necessities for my children to grow peacefully and humbly. There is no doubt that failure will come to my way with all of my hardships being a stepping stone to my greatest success.
The youngest daughter, Rosa, is known as the precious star among the villagers who showers her with endless praises with the recent news of yet another achievement she received from Saint Domus School of the Gifted. It is not to my surprise that my beloved daughter is the apple in the villagers’ sons as they fell head over heels in her presence. Her beauty and talent far exceeds my expectations as she has no problem in securing a stable future away from Salve.

On the other hand, her older sister Sienna is rather the exact opposite in terms of aptitude and features that makes Rosa noticeable to anyone within her range. Perhaps she had inherited her late father’s kindness instead of my intellect before her younger sister was born. It makes perfect sense that she can never be someone exceptional in others’ perspective because of her reclusive nature.
Such temperament cannot be accepted in any parts of Prex, or any places at all when everyone expects an individual who is able to be amiable in order to become a respectable member of society. Unlike Rosa, Sienna attended the local school with the perpetual content expression and return without uttering a word about what happened with her day. Fortunately, I have yet to receive any complaints regarding her performance in academics, sports and the like from the teachers during the start of kindergarten until she reached her early adolescence. Naturally, her sister will be excited in recalling how she effortlessly aced her examinations with flying colours.
If only Sienna is kind enough to show a glint of emotion in her sister’s accomplishments she could never attain. The two are so different from each other that if they ever dressed and acted similarly, I could tell who is who with my capability in raising them into their own individualities. Of course, it is Rosa who stands out the most with her desirability whereas Sienna can remain invisible to all without trying.

It is not her fault for growing up that way after her father’s death changed her for the worst, due to their strong bond with each other. There is a possibility that she is living in denial of Theodore’s passing instead of helping herself to become a successful person to avoid a life of poverty. Rosa hardly knew Theodore due to the fact that she was born months before he was bedridden when Sienna was four. She only remembered him as the person who will always make her mother cry whenever she sees his physical state and should not be forgiven.

This resulted in arguments between the two sisters on who is the cruel one when disregarding my late husband who left us with no choice but to struggle on our own. When the shouting match is over, I beckoned Rosa over to comfort her while assuring her that she is not the in the wrong while Sienna refuses to leave her room. In the aftermath of the fight, I would use some of my savings to buy a new gift for Rosa to lift her spirits while Sienna tends to her wounded self.

Such a silly girl, to resort to such a manner when it is easier to apologize to her sister for accusing her of being callous when she should have not raised her voice. With her regular clothing consisting solely of long sleeved shirts, the villagers would not question on her dreadful expression as she barely talks to anyone who approaches her. If only she could be more understanding like her sister, people will begin to notice her as a normal person.

Sienna’s birth was not known around the parts of Salve as nothing interesting was recognized as the local successful merchant couple having their firstborn daughter. There are times when I was held back to indulge in business meetings among other traders while Theodore took the time to care for Sienna while I was away. He was a gentle person despite his eccentricities clouding people’s judgement in hopes of expressing himself.

I never knew what the two did but they were truly at ease with each other as odd people can commute with themselves in their own world. On sunny days, Theodore would bring Sienna out to the meadow field when I became too busy to attend to her with my business becoming victorious with my excellent strategies. At the end of the day, the girl could not stop talking endlessly about the cloud people she and Theodore created out of nowhere.

Spouting nonsense in becoming the cloud guardians to protect the princess who governs the sky realm with her faithful servants. Such tales are rather childish to be taken seriously by anyone with common sense to comprehend the meaningless figment of imagination. Instead of becoming a valued merchant such as myself, Sienna was certain in choosing a path as a writer in the future which would be a worthless career in the advancing age of society.

Who is ever sensible enough to hire a person who writes their delusion onto paper and pen for those who are foolish enough to spend money on a waste of trees? I would never dream of investing my time and energy to even think about transcribing things of least importance as it only lives for a short period before fading into the nothingness of memory. She should have chosen a better occupation if she ever wants to become a person of much interest in the high rise of the public.

When the years have passed and Sienna turned four, I wasted no time in sending her off to kindergarten so that Theodore would return to the trading world instead of being preoccupied with his silly fantasies. 

Unfortunately, that did not stop the young girl from spending his precious time of rest to continue their journey to the illusionary world. It would seem that they have already created an opposing faction who is against the cloud rulers for being overly idealistic in the way they are leading their people.
Meanwhile, a neutral side remains at peace as they do not want to create havoc in their realms but would occasionally spar with both factions for entertaining values. 

For having so much time in building a setting in a short period of time, Sienna must have not been doing well in class when she is too busy indulging in her daydreams. My condolences are given to the kindergarten teachers who must put up with her during the day when she is not disturbing her father at night.

In order to remedy the troublesome bond, I gave a reminder to Theodore to attend to my needs when I was pregnant with Rosa. Despite his reluctance, he adheres to whatever I may request him to do until my daughter is born. During the time, Sienna will be in her room for hours unless Theodore urges her to leave so that they can spend time together.

When the time came around for the birth of my youngest daughter, I knew there will be good luck heading in the way to where I can claim it of my own. With that, life began to change for the better as the significant birth of Rosa became a starting point where my name will be known throughout the kingdoms. There was absolutely nothing that will deteriorate my ambition in becoming a member in high society where money and power are the very most important things in life.

That is to say, until Theodore caught a disease and became incapacitated as a result of taking care of Sienna while I was caught up in my work to handle her. With that, I had to take a long leave for maternity reasons and to watch over my sick husband. Three years went by and there was no sign of him ever being cured.

It was an agonizing moment for everyone as we watched Theodore succumb to his illness and passed away in his sleep. Many tears were shed in the memory of the cherished husband to the mourning wife and daughter. Rosa was the only one who did not wept as she did not know the concept of death, which sparked hostility within Sienna’s heart.

Have I ever had regrets prior to this moment? I do not think it is possible for me to carry any when I have never committed any mistakes in my life. I merely wished that I did not have to deal with miscreants interrupting my attempts in succeeding life.
I would, however wish to become a more accomplished person than I have in the present. It would be a tragedy if Prex lost one of their most independent merchant ever to set foot in Salve. Without me, others’ lives would not have been better if I had never conducted business in the first place.",21Aug2019,5

Probably won't have the money to until you retire at age 80. Want to make art all the time? You'll absolutely not have the time or energy.


You can't commit your life to *anything* unless it's #2 to your job. That's as good as anything can get.

Last month we started hanging again, thinking I was all good. Well, it didn’t take long for the feelings to come back.

I was so nervous I almost vomited. But, I told her the truth and she totally understood and told me to take as long as I needed, even if it be years.

30,"I just listened to a vid on youtube about reddit users that had to be in bad foster homes, it reminded me a little bit of my own childhood. It wasn't awful, but until CPS people came in and scared my parents it wasn't great either. My mom was over-worked, probably suffering from undiagnosed anxiety and taking her anger out on her father and me. This ordeal was something my family never brought up and I don't like to mention it because things aren't the way they used to be and the guilty parties would just feel worse for having remembered what they did.

I was in elementary school at the time. Mom used to be incredibly impatient with me and lose her temper very quickly, which to my little-kid mind I thought I was doing something wrong. Luckily later on she corrected some of her mistakes in that way and I came around to an easier way of being a human.

There was one moment before I went to school one day that was the turning point for everything. Mom had never gotten so angry at me, and I was unable to process what I was doing wrong so I just stood there, crying and dodging the things she threw at me. She threw them in a way that I wouldn't actually be hit by them, because the last thing she threw did hit me. It only did because I stopped ducking and it hit me square in the chest, luckily it only left a small bruise and didn't hurt. She immediately apologized and said she didn't want to hurt me or for it to have hit me. But she asked me not to tell anyone.

When I got one of my classes, I had a nagging feeling in my head to tell someone, a teacher, anyone in authority. So at the end of class I was walking out of class and off-handedly mentioned what had happened that morning. The teacher stopped me and asked me to show her the bruise, I hadn't told her where it was. As I didn't know flashing in public was a no-no I really just lifted my shirt to show her. Then I walked out and forgot about the whole thing.

Toward the end of the day two CPS agents came in to talk to me, we went to an empty kindergarten room that I'd been in once. I don't remember if I knew who these people were from the get-go but when they started asking about what happened that morning I just recounted what I had to the teacher. I showed them the bruise as well and they looked at each other, then sent me back to class.

I think it was the next week that a CPS agent came to the house and recounted what I had told them. My grandpa looked at me as if I was in trouble to saying such things and wanted to punish me, so I apologized to mom for even telling anyone in the first place. She said she was glad that I had and I felt justified after.

After that CPS agents came to my house periodically, maybe once a month or so. The biggest thing I remember was that they gave my mom and her father a deadline to get the house cleaned, and mom and grandpa were afraid if the house wasn't clean by then I'd be put into a foster home. They didn't tell me as such but I had the feeling myself. Luckily the house wasn't dirty to begin with and we got a clean bill of family health, pun intended, when the CPS came.

Mom was summoned to court and was given a lawyer. I don't remember that part very well because she'd always send me to do something else while she was at the courthouse. She was ordered to attend therapy and was given a good therapist comparatively speaking, as she'd been able to converse with other women in her situation that were assigned to other therapists that would reschedule or treat their clients like crap. I should mention they all had a mandated number of hours they had to attend these therapy sessions and the more these therapists rescheduled the longer they still had to attend therapy. Mom brought me with for some of the therapy sessions as the therapist wanted to meet me. I didn't especially want to be there because I knew why she was there and that all of it was my fault. 

A week or two after everything died down I was back at school and the same CPS agents came to pull me out of class, took me to the same kindergarten classroom only this time I learned that the kindergartners weren't done for the day, they were just using the classroom for me and the kids were going to lunch or to play or something. When we got in the room the agents asked me if everything was fine, and when I replied that it was, they gave me looks like they didn't believe me. I do have a kind of resting deadpan face so that would throw anyone off. 

By the end of it, I was right to have gone through this ordeal with my mother because she was taught a bit more patience and how to control her anger, and she's a different person than she'd been when I was much younger.

35,"     I'm looking for other perspectives.
     I'm a sucker for that powerful combinations of feelings one gets when she/he has met someone new that piques his/her interest romantically. It's a combination comprised of optimistic unknowing, a feeling of endless possibility, wanting to share new experiences with her/him, wanting to create new meaningful memories, and many great others. I've never felt these feelings with someone, but I more so have a yearning to feel these feelings with someone.
     Assuming I'm not the only human being to have ever felt like this, I ask you ( yes, you!) what your experience with this mutant ball of feelings has been. After being with a really completely splendid person for a while, did those feelings coming from being with them diminish or disappear? Has an urge to feel those beginning-of-relationship feelings ever popped up in you while you were still with your significant other? I'm afraid that even when I do find someone I want to spend the rest of my life with, I won't be rid of this yearning.
     For context, I'm 17 years old, recently broke up with my long-term girlfriend, and have lived in a small town all my life.
     It seems like every time I see a cute/pretty girl my mind begins flooding with possibilities and attraction. Am I a dumb incel? Could this be stemming from confusing hormones, loneliness brought on by my recent break-up, new possibilities also dropped at my doorstep due to my break-up, something completely different, or all of the above? Perhaps this deep wanting of endless possibilities with a new partner is tied to me sitting with incremental patience to have a great college experience full of opportunity in less than a year.
     Any input is greatly appreciated. I hope you can give this sad boy some perspective. Thanks for listening!",21Aug2019,2

40,"So, I don't mean change my mind as in change my stance on some sort of opinion or even some sort of issue. I mean I want to change how I am mentally. 
I am riddled with anxiety, depression, and sensitivity that makes them both worse and especially as of lately. I have found myself to sensitive to the smallest things I just happen to notice (since apparently my brain just can't stop thinking and just take things at face value) that someone or something isn't ""normal"" and it seems to blow itself out of proportion as a super horrible thing that plays out in my mind as an event to hurt me big time for the long run. 
It's just exhausting in all honesty, and it hurts. It hurts to be so scared of the future and so pessimistic of even what I have now because I realize that, in the end, I regret those bouts of anxiety/depression where I let it happen in understanding the feelings would pass. And now? I feel like they've hurt me... and hurt me big time now...
I made the mistake earlier or letting myself be alone with my thoughts for 15 minutes, and it was enough to make me shut down and even ignore my boyfriend's help even though he doesn't suffer any sort of severe anxiety or depression like I do.

52,"My [26F] ex boyfriend [23M] got me into a ton of debt over a couple of years. I was naive enough to let him use my credit card and lend him money when his crazy mother kicked him out for not following her religion. Add that to a bad past, ongoing depression and anew job in finance and the drug use kicked up from 0 to 100 pretty damn quick. We lived a little further apart at the time so it took a while for me to find out what was going on, and of course I didn't want to believe anything so bad could be happening soi guess I was ignoring the red flags too. This led to years of me struggling with tens of thousands in credit card debt and loans in my name, working 6/7 days a week at times and staying in a job I despised just to cover the minimum payments and bills, telling myself it would only take another year or two to pay it all (more likely 20) and the I'd be free to live my life.

Fast forward to now I'm 3 months into my bankruptcy, haven't had to look at another credit card bill, I can work part time and have some time for myself and to heal mentally instead of just working to pay off debt and I've just had it confirmed that I can move overseas without any issue. I'm planning to head to New Zealand in November to work and travel and live free again.

I debated this decision for a long time and only wish I'd done it sooner. My credit file was already affected by the debt for the same time as the bankruptcy would be there so it made sense to just start again, accept the damage and move on, hopefully a little wiser.

For anyone struggling with something similar, be realistic about time frames, will it take longer to pay things off than a debt solution would affect you? Are the big things bankruptcy impacts for a few years like getting more credit or buying a house etc already out of reach for now? I believe it's better to be free with a little to your name than tied into a system where you only work to put money in other people's pockets. Best of luck y'all!",21Aug2019,6

55,"So i originally intended to post this to r/casualconversation but i realized that that sub is suited for positive posts, which it isn't, so i am moving it here. I realize that my reasons for leaving Reddit seem trivial, but i want to leave a trace explaining my absence.

I have been on Reddit for about 2 years and amassed nearly 51k karma. I spent a lot of great time here, although i was left frustrated with being banned from 3 or 4 subreddits, but overall not a big deal. I learned some interesting stuff and improved my English skill (mostly passive, but my writing has got better, too).

However, yesterday i decided that i must take a long break from Reddit. In fact, i might not even return, though that's to be seen. Why is that, you might ask?

Well, while i was in 95% cases friendly or neutral towards fellow users, i am not claiming to have been a saint during my time here. I sometimes (rarely) insulted a fellow Redditor and got insulted back, or the opposite. I never used such an insult that might have been seen as something particurarly offensive, though. I don't recall throwing slurs on anyone's mom, for instance. I was sometimes left frustrated when someone insulted me but it was never too big of a deal.  


However, the day before yesterday and yesterday i got two seperate people call me a slur which absolutely infuriated me. The first one was when i was having an intense argument with a guy in a private conversation called me an idiot (which is okay, as i had called him that), called me dyslexic (i made some typos while on mobile and used simplified sentences which he interpreted as gibberish, and obviously a couple of mistakes in a foreign language make me an idiot) but also a \*waste of oxygen\*.

 That particular insult was mind boggling to me, partially because i had never been called that before, partially because it is so derogatory that i can't comprehend it. I mean, how am i exactly \*wasting oxygen\*? I am doing anything wrong by living my life the best i can and enjoying myself? Are you implying that i need to end my existence? You see, i didn't get a choice when my father fucked my mother and inseminated her. It's not like i am here out of my own will, no! I am on this world because 2 people thought that without reproducing, their life would be much worse. I did not get a say on whether i want or not to be born, so accusing me of breathing is a FUCKING blow below the belt. How exactly am i \*wasting oxygen\* anyway? Around my house alone there are enough trees to absolutely nulify the impact of me breathing on the environment. I do not own a factory contaminating the air or anything. So how exactly does my existence \*waste\* oxygen?

&amp;#x200B;

The second time (which was very weird as, as i said, i had never been called that before) came, the next day, which was yesterday, when i made a meme someone didn't like and that person called me a \*waste of oxygen\*, just like the other guy. That was the dealbreaker to me. I deleted the Reddit app, and after i have written this post and read the responses (if there are any) i am cleansing my history, on not logging in Reddit for a LONG time. I mean how much of a piece of shit do you have to be to say that another human being, who has not commited any crimes, is a waste in any way? That's a fucking BLOW BELOW THE BELT. I am just enjoying my life and some dickhead on the Internet says that my existence is harmful to the environment. What the fuck? Are you implying that it would have been good for me to DIE? When i have not ever harmed anyone?

So after i have read the responses and maybe answered them, i am logging out of Reddit and not coming back for a long time. I have decided that without it, i will be a much happier person. No reason to worry about dickheads who say that your existence is worthless. From now on, i will be trying to cherish life without almost any social media. I am going to break my fast now and then watch a good movie. Bye.",21Aug2019,1

57,"I don't normally do this but here goes.

I'm 24M, a virgin and I fear I have fucked up my life beyond repair, and am such a loser I will never deserve the kind of girl I am attracted to (basically just kind, normal, feminine, good sense of humor etc)

I barely graduated high school with poor grades, due to extreme depression. I had a bad home life, was bullied a lot and was a social outcast. I haven't moved past it and I have been in a negative, depressed state for most of my life since high school.

I'm not stupid, but because of my ADHD/personality, I find it extremely difficult to focus on tasks like reading books and studying, depression makes it even worse. So I believed I was stupid for most of my life and I never went to college, but I also was never really encouraged to.

I have done almost nothing besides work a shit job for the past 6 years, isolating myself, and doing little outside of browsing reddit, playing games and watching youtube videos in my free time. the years just fly by. I might spend time with friends once every two weeks or something. They probably don't invite me to do stuff much because I have a boring life and am an almost unbelievably boring person.

I'm extremely boring. I have basically no interests or hobbies that I genuinely enjoy. I've tried some projects but I never finish anything. because of my ADHD, I've always taken the path of least resistance. and I jump around a lot in my interests, so I know very little about a lot of things. interesting people know a lot about a few things.

I also believe I have some sort of undiagnosed Aspergers/identity disorder. For whatever reason, I've never felt a strong sense of identity. Because of my imposter syndrome/lack of identity, I feel 'guilty' or 'stupid' liking certain music/movies/subjects/things. Like I feel like I could get girls if I dressed more stylish/whatever. but I would get imposter syndrome and I would feel like I'm trying too hard to ""seem"" like I have a personality (weird I know)

I'm not ugly at least I think, because some girls have hit on me. I'm not short or fat. but my frame is so small (6.5"" wrists low T beta male), and I have wide hips. I fear no woman will ever see me as a physically masculine man which is one of the most important qualities girls seem to look for, especially as I get older. Even though I have lifted weights and bulked for years to compensate I still have a narrow frame so it doesn't matter.  It's impossible to change

As I said I have been hit on a few times before, but I never pursued a girl in my life really. I know within 5 minutes of getting to know me they will be turned off because I'm boring, unambitious and unsuccessful. I'm also extremely shy and self-conscious especially around girls (yes I know hard to believe for someone 24 years old but I'm just a beta male). And even if somehow we hit it off, and they like me despite me being a loser, then there must be something wrong with them if they like guys who are losers, so I'm not attracted anymore. 

Is it possible to get over this and find love? If I won't ever find love, what's the point of living?

If you have any suggestions I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks for reading.",21Aug2019,1

He stopped responding consistently pretty quickly (he has a hard time of replying to everyone, according to his friends) and since it was summer when I brought it up, we talked about it via text for a bit and there wasn't too much of a difference.

School started again and I quickly realized that I was basically on the back burner. He gave what seems like excuses to me, and I just told him that he either put in effort or it's over.

It's been so much easier going about my day not trying to figure out plans that always fall through or trying to talk to him when he was clearly more interested in talking to his friends.

61,"I'm a sceptical person. I never believed in psychic attacks or anything, but something is happening in my life that is unreal. I'm going to tell it in chronological order from the beginning. I'm also going to include a lot of details because I'm trying to understand what is happening.

\-----------

2 years ago, my previous girlfriend and I broke up. It is the biggest mistake I've ever made. 2 months after that, I met V on my birthday at my house, we did some blow and I got her number,  She was 21 and I was turning 31 that day. She was attractive and I really wanted to bang her and she knew. Maybe a week later, we did. I don't remember much about that first time and I wonder if it was the first time I was drugged.

Fast forward 6 months and thing are going well, but V acts strangely sometimes. I have the feeling in the back of mind that she's not that into me, but then really wants to come to my family xmas, so I bring her even though I normally wouldn't have. V really liked situations where I didn't want to do something but she pushed and got her way. I gave her it way too often.

It slowly became clear that V wasn't quite who she pretended to be at first. I was used to someone who would just be honest all the time, so when V started lying I never called her out. She always had an excuse.

We did a lot of drugs. Especially cocaine. Lot's of cocaine sex. Looking back, it's so obvious that she was just building me up to break me down. We did wine tasting and had good food, often she would ask to borrow money. I would give it to her. Over time, I realized she never paid me back.

Things went like this for a while. It was nice. Every so often I'd get a look into her real side, like seeing her with a gun and cash on snapchat. Honestly I knew she would treat on me, but I was blinded by the sex with a 21 year old hottie.

She also had a DUI (doing 120 with 2.8) and I had to convince her to do her time.  
\-----------

V was obviously into other guys. We went to a rave once and she basically ended up with her top off making out with another girl and dancing with other guys.

She also had a friend Z, and he sold a lot of drugs. At one point I loaned him $1200, and he paid me back plus extra. I prob shouldn't have done it but I did.

I should mention that I do pretty well financially.  I'm a software engineer and I own a house and I work from home. I also bought a Tesla recently and V went with me to pick it up.

V got a new job,  I helped her get her license to sell insurance. It did not go well though. She was home a lot in the day but wouldn't wake up until at least 2 every day. I helped her by letting her live with me and not paying rent. She would often say that as soon as possible she would help with rent but never had any money.

I spent a month sober while she continued doing blow, saying she was getting it for free from her friend M. V told me she loved me.

\-----------

Then one day she flipped. She was less responsive to me, told me she was getting a new job which I thought was a good idea. We started having less sex and it wasn't very good. She actually completely stopped responding to me physically and was a complete asshole all the time.

She also looked different. Like a completely different person. She has this ability to flip between two separate people, the fun loving girl who I came to love and this absolute thug. She started listening to really thugged out music, some of which made me uncomfortable. I realize now she was mocking the fact that she was cheating on me and that I wasn't realizing it. I still need to get STD tested, but I think V would find it funny if I had an STD.

Nights started to get weird. She had always talked constantly about nothing with a lot of repetition, but I started to realize that this was a form of hypnotism. When I was really drunk she started making comments about other guys that she was ""friends with"".  More mocking, I now realize. 

One night, I left the door open and V told M how cool I was and how much she liked me more than her ex. It made me feel good but I realized V was doing it on purpose to gain my trust. She hated me and was fucking with my head.

I started to realize that our relationship was ending as she slowly started spending time at M's house and I wasn't really to her birthday. She ended up deciding to go at the last second, so I bought a ticket. The next day we ended up not going. I realize now that she got me to buy a ticket last second and then decided to not go, so I had to get a refund: I don't think she wanted me to get that refund.

Then shit got weird. I started to do a lot of whip its for some reason. I was depressed at how I was being treated and she was (I now realize) being purposefully malicious. Her friends were too.

M would come over with my permission and I would hang out with them until I was tired and went to bed. They would get really loud in the other room. I sometimes felt like shit.

One night, I walked out and the couch was moved and messed up. I now realize that they had taken some kind of psychoactive - I don't know if it's a drug - and basically knocked me out by putting something in the vent that went to my room. They started drugging me regularly, I think. I had constant headaches and I didn't know why. I assumed it was the whip its.

A few nights ago, this reached its peak. I was knocked out and taken from the house. I have vague memories of her friends all mocking me. M said how small my dick was and they were talking about other guys who were so much better. They were being completely malicious and I think broke my Tesla screen on purpose.

I'm afraid that's all I remember of that night. I have very few memories. I may have been raped, orally. My throat hurt. I ended up going to the doctor and I got antibiotics. V started talking about how she never loved me and how she loved fucking other guys. Saying anything she could to destroy me. She would do this after what I would consider hypnotising me: talking excessively about her work but not really saying anything and repeating shit over and over. I think that combine with the drugs I was being forced made me very susceptible.

There was maybe 1 or 2 weeks of me having these headaches and losing my mind. It was worse at night but I wasn't able to do my job. My boss remarked how tired I looked. This was when I realized something was really off. I was tripping - things were moving and it wasn't a good high. It was like having too much carbon monoxide. I was dying. My house - and I came to realize my fucking car - was making me get almost no oxygen.

\----------

I don't know what this drug is that they are using, but it's a big problem now. It's in my house. It's in my car. V obviously didn't care if I died. At some point I watched her change shape. She looked directly at me and told me she doesn't care about me at all. Probably due to the lack of oxygen in my brain, but she became a full on demon. I thought she was going to attack me. The next day she sent texts saying she cared, an obvious callback that she was bullshitting in her texts.

V got some bruises from her new job. Or at least that's what she said. Specifically that they ""didn't come from rough sex"" which I now realize that's exactly where they came from, but not with me. There were all sorts of callouts like this, making it hard to keep a timeline. Confusion about everything.

Her and her friends then started talking about all the guys they do this to. They are organized, going from guy to guy and city to city. They don't care if they die and I think they think that's funny. I think they just want to break each man as much as possible and get their assets. Honestly, it might be deeper than that. It feels like organized crime and they are evil witches literally trying to destroy and kill people. I think there are men in on it too. Z who I mentioned earlier, had a vibe about him when he came to my house that he might just take all my shit. I have DJ equipment and I know he wants it. I think he was working with V somehow.

My throat still hurts. The doctor said it was very inflamed, I think it is due to breathing whatever it is they put in the air ducts. A lot of what they did was make me feel like I as losing my mind, as I was high on this shit they would make it seem like events happened at different times.

\----------

I don't know how this ends, but I rekeyed all my locks today and took all her stuff outside and left for the night. My cats are in the house and I hope they are ok. I had to keep my head out the window of my car because it's full of this shit that makes me not able to breath (though odorless).

Has anyone else had to deal with something like this? It's so fucked up. I'm honestly worried about myself. These people are thugs. I expect to be extorted from some fucked up videos they made when I was completely incapacitated. Honestly I'm lucky I made it out the house.

Many of these scenarios remind me of a psychic war or some witchdoctor shit. I don't know how these people all meet each other, but I'm not used to such malice. It's honestly scary. I started carrying a knife and bought mace. I'm considering a gun. Also a restraining order.

\----------

If anyone has ideas on figuring out what this substance is and how to clean it up, please speak up. I can't really drive my car or be in my house. I am also open to ideas about things that I am missing. Are they on some witch doctor shit? Obviously they have no regard for human life.

What a fucked situation, aye? Where is this going? What is V's goal? I feel bad for anyone who meets this girl.",21Aug2019,2

I’m totally projecting out &amp; imagining the ways that this could get in the way of some super active lifestyle that my shallow brain is visualizing all of a sudden.

66,"I  cut off contact with a close friend 8 months ago. I've known him for 5 years. We talked on a daily basis and I considered him a very important part of my life. We got each other through some bad times.

Our friendship ended because of political and religious differences. This wasn't an issue at all for the first few years I knew him because we always respected each other and agreed to disagree. Then the current political climate happened.

He's a Christian but within the past few years he's gone full-blown fundamentalist and has become obsessed with the likes of Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, and much worse religious conspiracy circles.

 I'm gay as hell, atheist, and my sister is trans so of course I become the most convenient punching bag for him to take everything out on.

I  tried so hard to make things work. I just wanted my friend back but I couldn't have a conversation with him anymore without it devolving into an argument. I don't even have strong political opinions at all but I'm still the enemy. Things gradually get worse and he's calling me a ""faggot"" when he's upset. Something that he would NEVER do before outside of a an obvious lighthearted joke.

He's giving me speeches about how all my problems with depression and anxiety stem from me being gay and I need to just man up. Or how my father's absence turned me gay. He's using my personal issues and childhood traumas against me, throwing them in my face and blaming me, or doubting that they even happened.

This all comes at the worst time as I'm going through an unexpected family death and my mental health is declining to the point where all I'm doing is sleeping and trying my best to feel ""ok"".

I knew I had to make the choice to cut off contact for my own sake. I hated it and it took me a while to shake the urge to contact him when I was feeling down. I still miss him sometimes and wonder how he's doing. I just wish things could be different. I hope he doesn't hate me.

If anyone else has lost a friend to political or religious differences, just know you're not alone in this mess of a political climate and you don't have to forfeit your beliefs or values. Don't let anyone reduce you to some stupid political buzzword. Sometimes it's best to walk away and accept your differences instead of losing yourself trying to please others.",21Aug2019,6

Since she divorced my stepdad, I'm the only one who kept in contact with him. He raised us. He taught us right from wrong, the importance of integrity, and doing what you say. He's the most honest man I've ever met and he inspires me to be a better person everyday.

1200: I go to school to rub his check with Vick’s so he can breath better and nap well

1500: I go to school to give him the second dosage. And I go back home.
1745: i pick him up from school and we go home.
Am I tired? Yes because of all of that and because I’m starting to catch a cold. But I’m not nagging! I feel that I shouldn’t complain because this is what a mom is supposed to do.
Today I have some tests and US to do and after that I’m going to school to give his his cough syrup.

The closest I can think of is deep fondness and apreciation, but apart from *probably* my family, I have never met anyone who I could apreciate more than a friendly acquaintance. (I have been in a relationship with someone, but got told I broke their heart without knowing how. I assume by not caring about them as much as they did about the relationship)

All the people claiming to have broken hearts and hurting so much from love: I don't get you. 

How can you care so much about something? How can you care so much about someone? 

Do you actually feel pain or is that more of a metaphor? 

How can you be incapable of handling something so simple as a rejection/betrayal by someone within a few hours?

75,"This post is only here due to the lack of people I have to talk to about this subject but I've been battling with a crippling mental illness for 10 years now. Just trying and trying and trying to change my outlook on life so that I want to leave my bedroom everyday and experience life even by the teensiest bit. But as time goes on I realize more and more how uninterested I am in everything. Everything I used to be interested in I can't motivate myself to do or partake in. For the past 5 years i had to silently sadly accept that one of these times when I'm having a panicking episode, I am going to lose my life. My panicking disorder is so bad that I basically black out during these episodes and can't control myself. Whether it's me on the ground in a ball screaming in pain or me physically hurting myself somehow. I've gone through therapy, coucilling, hospital stays, medications (which some worked, some put me out of commission for a month or two. From bad side effects even after I've stopped taking the meds *hallucinating, sick as can be, can't mobilize around, focus, keep a conversation*) everyday in silently panicking to myself about this losing battle I am having.

91,"1) Stop waiting for exceptional things to just happen. They rarely do, and they can't be counted on. Greatness is cultivated; it's a gradual process and it won't come without effort.

2) Jealousy is a monster that destroys everything in it's path. It's absolutely useless, except to remind us there's a better way. We can't always control how we feel, but we can choose how we react to those feelings.

When I was younger, jealousy in relationships always led to shit turning out worse than it probably would have otherwise. Even when it was justified, even when a relationship was over, jealousy led me to burn bridges that I wished I hadn't.

3) College isn't for everyone, but you'll rarely be put square in the middle of so much potential experience. You'll meet people you probably wouldn't have otherwise, and as you eventually pursue your major, you'll get to know people who share your passions and dreams. Despite all the bullshit ways in which college sucks, it's still a pretty unique path on the way to adulthood. But on that note...

4) Learn to manage your money. It's way too easy to get into unsustainable debt. It only gets worse, and it makes everything harder. We don't always see the consequence of credit cards and loans when we're young, because the future seems so distant and undecided. But that debt isn't going anywhere... Try not to borrow money that you can't imagine yourself paying back now.

5) Floss every day, not just a couple times per week when you remember, or when you've got something stuck in your teeth. It matters, even if you're in your 20s and you've never had a cavity.

6) You'll always hear about living in the moment, seizing the day... It's tough to actually do. But there's something to be said for looking inward, and trying to recognize when too much of our attention is focused elsewhere. Constantly serving the future won't always pay off, at least not in the ways we think it will when we're young.

This sentiment doesn't have much value when it's put in abstract, existential terms, like it usually is. The best you can do is try to be aware of your own willingness and ability to be open to experiences. Think about ways in which you might be rejecting the here and now, even if it's as seemingly-benign as not going out with some friends because you just saw them, or you already went to that place they're going to. We won't recognize the good old days for what they were until they're already gone. The trick is having as many good days as possible.

7) Don't start smoking; you'll never quit as soon as you'll think you can. If you do start, make yourself quit after a couple years, no matter what. Keep your vices in check; drugs and alcohol in moderation. Use condoms, use birth control.

8) Don't make love wait. Tell your friends and family you love them often, and show them when you can. You're going to lose people, so it's important. Statistically, some of you will die young, yourselves.

When it comes to relationships, don't settle if you can't tell yourself you're in love, and totally believe it. Don't let complacency and familiarity get in the way of pursuing love. Don't be afraid to end relationships because they're comfortable, or because you've already invested so much into them.

Being young is a gift, and it won't last forever. You need to use that gift to experience all the love that you can, at least as a means to finding the person you really want to grow old with, if that's what you want. Regardless, you don't want to miss out on loving someone, and being loved, because of fear. Don't be reckless;  just be honest with yourself.

9) Take care of your body. Neglecting it makes everything tougher. That doesn't mean you have to work out every day and eat like a nutritionist, but if you're overweight or you have health issues, do what you can to fix it. Losing weight isn't easy, but it's not as hard as people make it out to be. And it's one of the most important things you can do to invest in a healthy adulthood.

Don't put off nagging health issues because you think you'll be fine, or you don't think you'll be able to afford it, or you're scared of the outcome. There will always be options, until there aren't. Most people never get to the no-options part. Or, they get there because all the other options expired.

10) Few things will haunt you like regret. Making the wrong choice, for example, usually won't hurt as much. I guess you can regret making the wrong choice, but my deepest regrets come from inaction, complacency and indifference.

So how can we avoid regret? I don't know, lol. I don't think it's as simple as just commiting to choices... Choosing to do nothing is still a choice, after all.
I think it's more about listening to your gut, as cliche as that sounds. There were times that, in my secret heart, I knew the path that would probably better serve me. I sometimes chose not to act on those feelings, and that led to some of the worst regrets of my life.

To thine own self be true, I guess. It's worth a shot, even if you fail. Almost anything is better than regret.",21Aug2019,3214

I was driving my 11 year old nephew home from his chosen lunch on his last day of summer, he was a little scared/weirded out by how the lighting was nearly striking on top of us. Then I told him to help me watch you, because you were in real danger with the cars passing you in this downpour and were really hard to see. I told him we were gonna ride behind you as long as we could and protect you guys because we could. Because someone should. I told him I had a friend in California who was a really careful biker a few years back who died on his way home from work when an SUV changed lanes on top of him. So I wanted to make sure that didn't happen to you guys, too. We stayed just close enough to prevent assholes from trying to cut in front of us not seeing you. 

And because sometimes you have to watch out for each other even if the people you are helping don't know it. His fear was gone now, he was alert in watchman mode. I flipped on my hazards and just followed your slow lead into the grey abyss.

We followed you to our exit. You got off there too I assume to huddle under the overpass. We waved as you turned left and us right flipping the hazards off, you didn't notice but that's okay you had alot to deal with.

Vast majority of reddit users knows this story. In all likelihood you know this story too.

The story don't differ much from other fake stories that are out there. However, this particular one gained popularity. It gained popularity to the point where most reddit users - and there are over 300 million of them - know it.

The reason it became so well-known, in spite of being a rather average-written story, was moderators verification. That's right. The author of this story managed to prove it's real and the magic badge \*verified\* made it stand out from the crowd. More and more people grew interested and shared it with everyone they knew. Before too long it was even quoted by digital journalists and published on websites not assosiated with reddit itself. For those interested; they should pop up on the [first google page](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;ei=bJxdXYW3HtSp1fAP3rS78Ao&amp;q=IAMA+man+who+had+sexual+relationship+with+his+mother&amp;oq=IAMA+man+who+had+sexual+relationship+with+his+mother&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...87966.88304..88586...0.3..0.97.353.4).

Trouble is, the story and verification are both **fake**.

Why would the moderators falsely verify something is anybody's guess.

Worth noting is that reddit was relatively unpopular since years 2005-2012. In the year 2012 the story triggered responses and set the reddit on fire. More and more users registered their accounts after bumping into the story on google, after clicking the link on fb or other independent websites, or by the word of mouth. Since then reddit started to grow **fast**. And as I already mentioned, there are more than 300 million registered users as of **now**. Many users don't have accounts though so the total numberof users must be bigger.

Could it be that reddit admins wrote the story and faked verification in order to cause sensation hoping to attract traffic to reddit?

Nobody knows. But it wouldn't be the first time in the history of the world. How many celebrities got popular because of a scandal? A lot of them. How many websites in history got popular after publishing attention-grabbing articles? A lot of them.

Bear in mind that reddit exists for about **14 years** and it's **the only verified story on reddit** until now.

The reason is that moderators **don't even try** verifying anything like that.

Go ahead and try to verify similar story. You pm moderator of AMA subreddit, you tell them what your story is about and... '**I can't think of a way you could verify that. We won't be discussing that any longer**.' At least that's the response I got. You might be more lucky although I doubt it.

Now the real question is: how on earth was the ""broken arms"" story verified if noone else can verify anything?

I am not a conspiracy-dude. All I'm trying to say is that **nothing adds up** here. In my book the whole thing is staged, whether it was a random guy who wanted to troll, or administration. It could also be both; u/verifiedson once mentioned that the moderator was his **friend.** Perhaps he didn't mind letting his friend troll. Perhaps he really did verify it. 

But if he really did then why not verifying more of them? **Why**?

Nothing makes logical sense here. Facts contradict one another and that's enough for me to suspect foul play.

Seeming genuineness is **the only reason** people bothered reading and sharing the story. It's also the only reason this 7 years old story is **still alive**. 

Just read comments in different subreddits. Chances are you will find 20 references to this 7-year-old ""broken arms"" story in an hour or less. That's what we call staying power.

Would that be the case if it weren't for verification? Does the pope pray in a mosque?

Now I will share with you several observations which further convince me the whole thing is all but a big, fat lie.

First of, verified in suspicious circumstances.

Second of, **alleged researcher.** Apparently the whole thing described in a post is verified by a doctor slash researcher. Only... It's been seven years and we haven't heard a word from him? The paper still isn't finished? Not even an abstract?

What is his website? What's the title of his paper? **What is his goddamn name**?

I took some time trying to find incest studies and people working on them in hope of bumping into the researcher from our famous post. 

Guess what I've found.

**Nothing**. I've found absolutely **nothing.**

If you find something then feel free to post it. I'll appreciate if you prove me wrong with this one.

But you won't. If the researcher really existed then obviously u/verifiedson would of given us his name long ago. He's rather active on reddit and the question had been asked hundreds of times. He simply ignored it. He keeps ignoring it. And I don't think he will suddenly come here with the name.

Or maybe he will come. But only to say that the researcher had an accident/indigestion/heart attack/was murdered/insert anything that will kill him/etc. and so the paper will never be published.

Phew. Now you don't have to admit the whole thing was all but red herring.

Third of, he **didn't write to inform**. He **wrote to craft**. It matters because AMA is basically about informing. You get questions from people and answer them. You go into every detail of the situation your askers are interested in and basically tell them everything.

Why did he answer less than 1% of all several thousand questions?

Why did he focus on **answering meaningless questions** whilst omitting meaningful ones? Why did he closed the topic saying ""most questions have already been answered"" when they haven't?

Mate: have they really? I'm still hoping you can tell us the name of the M.D. And how did you verify yourself. And hundreds of other unanswered questions.

You see, the whole thing is **written using techniques** writers use to **craft plots** for either **short stories,** **novels or screenplays**. I won't go into details how it's done exactly. Google is your friend if you're interested.

If the post was indeed genuine the author wouldn't picky-answer questions the way he did, wouldn't omit details and would certainly provide more context. He would also answer **all of them**.

Fourth of, he would **counter the accusations**.

I read through accusations in comments and apparently there were **similar stories before this one** on other websites. Some of them no longer exist but one of them has been copied and pasted since 2009 for several years on various discussion forums. It was knows as [""my son's penis problem"".](https://jezebel.com/incest-as-medical-treatment-not-fda-approved-5182256) You know, a story about helpful and selfless mother Helping Out her poor indisposed son.

Another one, even more similar to the verified AMA, was posten on **yahoo** just **one day after the broken arms reddit post**. [Here you are](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20121223210758AA1dPt0). Moreover, identical post was created years before that. [Just look](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/c8wmw/i_have_been_helping_my_amputee_son_and_i_have_not/).

Well now. Could it be the same person behind all three stories? Writing styles and plots are almost identical so we can't exclude this possibility.

If you ask me I'd say even money it is the **same person** behind all of them.

All of the guys there are 14 so that's one tick. It's a helpful and selfless mother with good intentions, that's another tick. It's a problem with arms and indisposition also so there we got three ticks.

Clear as day we got an aspiring novelist experimenting with his imaginery plot.

&amp;#x200B;

People always take some sickly interest in sensation and controversy. However, [lack of verification](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/c8wmw/i_have_been_helping_my_amputee_son_and_i_have_not/) always leaves the topic forgotten, whereas realism, even if [faked](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nmmjr/iama_man_who_had_a_sexual_relationship_with_his/), keeps them alive **forever**.

Administration **must** be aware that controversy sells. They wouldn't have grown reddit if they didn't. So it was either them hoping to attract more traffic on reddit by faking verification and consequently intriguing millions of people who one way or another bumped into the ""broken arms"" story, or u/verifiedson getting his friend to fake it so he could enjoy his time of day after years of unsuccessful attempts.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a **great chance everything was staged.** We have all the reasons in the world not to give the story the benefit of the doubt in spite of alleged verification.

If anyone is going to explain how the story was initially verified and give us the name of the alleged researcher remains to be seen. My hopes are high. But that we shall see.

There’s literally nothing we haven’t done together. We’ve been best friends since May 20, 2006 (though was only 12/14 of us back then.) Even though I was 18 months old back then, I still remember when we hung around at an airport in Las Vegas, then went to McDonalds and the park and even stayed at a hotel with each others’ parents. 6 months after we met, we traveled to Mexico together.

We did all kinds of stuff, we’d walk around stores and push each other in a shopping cart, we’d walk around the Las Vegas Strip, we’d have movie nights and sleepovers including parties too, because we are homeschooled we’d have study nights and homework nights during January-May and September-December, and visiting new cities in our state.

We’d occasionally visit casinos with our parents to go swimming, have mini vacations, watch movies, and play in arcades. We’d also visit Arizona, Utah, and California for some vacations!

We watched our 2 members, Nick and Anthony get married in 2016 and that was an exciting time for us!

There’s been some bad times in the span of 2015 to now, but of course we got through all that together!

We’re gonna be moving to Georgia all together in December this year! We plan on doing even more activities throughout the years! Even watching as the rest of us get married, too!

But there’s one thing that hits really hard at certain times...It’s the fact when one of us dies. If one of us were dying, the thing we plan on doing is just taking him/her home, singing some lovely songs together, and hugging him/her, and holding his/her hand until he/she eventually passes away..

Our plan with burial and such if one of us dies is to have a gravestone with all our full names written on it, all 14 of us. And to think of it makes us really sad.

106,"As the title says, I became friends with someone who is causing me lots of anxiety now.

Back story: I've been living in a new city/state for several years and had only made friends with my roommate and my partner. I decided to try out the friendship side of bumble (the app) cuz I was starting to feel pretty lonely having to rely on two people for my social life. I ended up meeting this girl (I'll call her Cynthia) who ended up being a lot like me! In grad school, open minded, smoked weed, liked to dance.... 

After we met, we instantly hit it off and started hanging out all the time. We'd get together after work some nights, hang out on the weekends.... All was well.

But since that time we met (over half a year ago), I've come to realize that Cynthia is trouble waiting to happen. Besides depression and self esteem issues (which is totally fine, not the first time I know someone going through some shit), she's overly competitive, outspoken, argumentative..... Seriously, if it's a topic she disagrees on, it's never a discussion, its always an argument. Every week there's some new drama in her life, whether it's with guys she's trying to date or school or work or family. She is quick to dismiss anyone who has even the slightest flaw even though she is an extremely flawed individual herself. Overall she requires effort to be around and requires way more support than I can give (especially since my job is, quite literally, to be a source of support for families in town). 

When we first met she explained to me how difficult it's been for her to make ""meaningful relationships"" in town (we're both from out of state) which all makes sense now. Of course nobody wants to befriend someone who is constantly playing devil's advocate, who gets nasty during simple conversation and games, who constantly creates drama in their own life.... 

I'm at a point where being her ""close"" friend is giving me daily anxiety. But I'm stuck cuz now it's routine for us to hang every weekend, for her to be invited to any and every outing, etc. What's worse, we planned a trip together for the entirety of labor day weekend, meaning unless I can find an escape, I will have to spend an entire long weekend with her (and the whole point of the trip was for me to ""get away and decompress"" since my job has been causing me a ton of anxiety lately).

I've already decided to begin distancing myself from her because truthfully, I prefer having friends who I'm naturally comfortable around. I'm waaaay past that phase of keeping toxic people close in my life simply due to loneliness. It's just not worth it. The energy isn't worth it. But man do I wish I knew how to ""break up"" with a friend. I'm in too deep.",21Aug2019,3
107,"I'm an in-n-out gym guy. I have months of commitment to health per year, where I diet and work out, then I pig out for the rest of the year.

And I realised I'm always suppressing myself in respect for others. I literally sometimes feel like laughing out loud, and now I wish I could be like ""teeheehee"" while I skip rope and be like ""yaaaay"" when I drop dumbbells (not literally drop).

There should be an adult playground for a gym, where people are all like ""yippee"" ""woohoo"".

108,"I find this very difficult to explain, so let me start by telling you a few things about my life. I live in the UK, in an affluent area close to London. I'm 17 years old and part of a middle class family. I go to a state school, but because the area is so middle class, it isn't far off a private school. I'm currently in the Summer break period after my first year in sixth form. Over the past year I have worked incredibly hard, the only two things I cared about were being one of the top performers in my year group and bodybuilding. Generally, I spent all my time either doing schoolwork/revising or working out/eating food to grow muscle. I became one of the most muscular people in my year group and just about the top performer in every one of my classes. 

This is where the problems start. For starters my ego went through the roof, I remained humble and respectful so this wasn't a problem in itself, but, as I will discuss shortly, it had consequences later on. Secondly, I became extremely isolated: I've always been the type of guy who's not really into just hanging out in a group, and I haven't had a social group in a long time (I have friends but they are all in their own separate groups). I have done less social activity this past year than any other year of my life and when I have met up with friends, the conversation has always been about me, what I'm feeling/thinking and what I want to talk about (I didn't realise until recently but this really increased the ego problem). On top of this, I'm not on social media, my two brothers don't really do much and my family doesn't talk about much besides school and politics, all contributing to this isolation that I was building around myself. All I thought about was how I could perform better in school or build more muscle.

To be fair, things weren't too bad at this point, I was proud of myself, excited about my bright future and overall I was satisfied with my life. Then one day, my trail of thought leads me to remember how terrible I was when I was 12 years old. Without getting into it too much, I was one of those kids who craved attention and set up anonymous Instagram accounts, interacting in cringey and often inappropriate ways with other kids in my year group. Within around ten minutes, my over-inflated ego was completely shattered. The following days were the worst days of my life, I was severely depressed and I remember just sitting on a bench in my town, watching everybody go about their day, just thinking to myself that I was pure scum and I was hiding my true evil self. Over the next week, I went around apologising to everyone I had wrong-done when I was 12. I was confronting people I hadn't spoken to in years to admit that I was behind such and such Instagram account.

Its been 3 months since this breakdown happened. I'm not depressed anymore but there is still a little part of me that feels like shit. From the moment of my breakdown right up until now, I haven't been able to work nearly as hard as I did pre-breakdown, this has given me a low self-esteem because I feel fucking pathetic now that I can't pride myself on being hard-working. These days, I work adequately hard and I can get by/ stay on top of things, but I feel guilty because I allow myself to have so much spare time that I don't deserve because everything I have has been gifted to me in the form of privilege. 

I could ramble on for a lot more, but I'll stop myself here. Recently I've been meeting my friends more and I've talked a lot about this issue and they say I'm just overthinking. Just interested and keen to find out what others have to say so any replies are very much appreciated.",21Aug2019,1

A year ago, my psychologist asked me what do I like about myself. I didn't answer, I was quiet, because I couldn't tell. Then I changed the topic. 

I've always been nobody. My life has always been terrible. I've never had any friends or people who would care about me (except my parents). I live on one of the most horrible places my whole life. People on our street are very abusive. It's one of the things that causes me (and other people) depressions. I was abused at home since the age of 4-16 (mentally and physically). When I was 17, I was mentally abused at school. One of the reasons is something I did when I was very young (I didn't hurt anyone) and I feel like I'm going through consequences now. I started to have depressions and I had serious problems because of it (nearly dropped out from school).  
I was so selfish. I only cared about myself, not my parents, who felt miserable because of me. I could hear my mom crying sometimes, but I didn't care much. I had my problems. Problems, they wouln't understand. I didn't open up to anyone, because it's something that can't be fixed, without time travel. My depression turned into anger a year ago. I'm always angry, full of hate. I'm angry at myself/other people. I can literally feel the pressure in my chest every day, even when I'm quite calm and I know it's anger. 

I am stupid. I graduated from HS as a stupid baker!!! I don't have a job. I feel like a piece of wood, I'm slow, weak, useless. I have no talent. Music: 0%, creativity: 0%, dance: 0% intelligence: very low. 
Plus, I'm super ugly (my face is hideous), super shy, introverted, weird ect. 

I have no goals. I don't know what I wanna do in my life. I can't imagine my life in 5 or 10 years. Impossible. All I can see is emptiness. That means: nothing at all!!

2-Having grave concerns about the state of the world/country(and admittedly,being a..*tad* dramatic about it)is *also* punishable by not only death\*,ridicule and cyberbulling,but you end up getting a legion of people who think that shrinks are the goddamn avengers/justice league rolled into one and get told to ""get help""(which...if the world was to go bye-bye,they'd be just as dead as the rest of us,so,Idk about that nonsense,but whatever.)  


3-Being WRONG is punishable by death\*,ridicule and cyberbulling.  


4-Talking crazy? again,punishable by death\*,ridicule,cyberbulling,""get help""(the mental health system in the U.S is fucking trash...but,again,what the hell ever.)  


5-And about those concerns? turns out you're not supposed to give a shit...ok.  


6-Think you can shitpost/ramble and hope to escape notice?...WRONG..see above.  


7-Wanting to ACTUALLY get started on educating myself on certain things? Getting banned/told to get help..again(Honestly,that really comes across as condescending..which leads me to my next point)  


8-It turns out there are people who think while the world isn't sunshine,rainbows,milk and honey,it's not quite hellfire,brimstone,damnation and despair(yet anyway)...again,thinking otherwise:punishable by death\*,ridicule and cyberbulling and calls to get help...and I live in a country where mental health is worth less than the dog shit you pass on the road when you go for a run.  


9-Who knew that crazy shitposting could make you a prime target for trolls/the bane of reddit?..again,punishable by death\*,ridicule,cyberbulling and the famous ""get help"".  


Sigh.  


I really,REALLY guess that a LOT of people think:  


\-That everything is gonna be alright(must be nice to be so optimistic..)  


\-That bad shit WILL happen...but we will survive somehow(again,nice optimism there)  


\-That you shouldn't give a shit(...tell that to people who lived through the cold war..pretty hard to not give a shit when you had a good chance of dying in nuclear fire,for one.)  


\-Think that..our politicians/news media are full of shit and that there are measures to prevent our..leadership(I use that term VERY loosely) from doing anything too terrible(Hah..hasn't really worked,if you ask me.)  


\-That there is so much to worry about besides  vague shit(on that,if true,I agree..)  


So,tl;dr:It seems that if your head gets the better of you and you decide to shipost/ramble/rant,etc.:  


Your punishment will be **Death\*,ridicule,cyberbulling and calls to get help.**  


It simply never ends...all you can do is what you gotta do and that's it.  


Whatever.

121,"As the title said, today marks the day that she finally decided that she dosen't love me, that se continued to tell me that she loved me and that i make her happy because she was trying to understand. She said that she didn't like my behavior, she didn't like it before, and that se wanted to be with me because she had fear to be left alone. I don't know how to feel, i don't know what to do, i wrote down here because i don't know how to procede in my life. She was my everything and this is so damn painfull to me. She acted like she didn't gave a fuck, when saturday and sunday she was lovely, she wanted only me, she loved me. I don't know how to think. I'm feeling lost.  
What can i do to stay calm and be better?  
Sorry for bothering you with my problems, but i need to talk with someone.  
Plus sorry if i did some mistake, english is not my first language

Thank you for your help",21Aug2019,5
122,"I admit it: I'm not only concerned about the Amazon rainforest, there's a part of selfishness in this outburst of sadness. I'm 21 and I have my whole life ahead. Today I spent all day with my girlfriend. We were talking about traveling the world after university, just before ""start our life together"" (We have been together for 5 years). We've choose some place to visit, searched for some traveling offers (just for fun) and when we've had enough I've started to daydream about having children. I know there are a lot of young couples but saying something like ""I want you to be the mother of my sons"" is totally out of the ordinary for me, and that's emotional. We were comfortable talking about it, It was a very peaceful morning. Later I opened YouTube to see yesterday's debate in the senate, yes, Italy is in a government crisis, again. I'll skip the part about politics, in a few words: after hours of speeches probably we're going to vote in autumn and there isn't a political party where a young man, with a minimum of respect for the facts opposed to the speeches for the crowds, can be rapresented. 
Then I decided to look at Twitter to see what's going on in politics and in the rest of the world and I noticed it: #PreyforAmazonas. Sixteen days ago the biggest rainforest in the world starts to burn with the highest rate ever. I know that fires comes every years in this season and that humans are deforesting constantly. But I've seen data and read a lot.. Probably a part of them are arson. I've seen photos of São Paulo covered in the smoke (3000km far from the fires) . 
Photos from airplane of uncontaminated forest, trees as far as the eye can see with fire proceeding in a line 'till the horizon. Apocalyptic images. First of all I was angry because of the lack of media coverage and letterally people setting forest on fire. Then comes sadness. There is no help from the rest of the world: this is a world crisis. Amazon rainforest produces 1/5 of the oxygen we breathe. The oxygen my sons will breath. Only if I decide to have them. Because now I will not be confortable talking about it with my girlfriend. I have lost the hope for a change in climate trend. It's a one way road, every year can only be worst. Old wills to leave the country come backs hearing politicians speaking about how will waste our money and our resources for the next years, instead of solve problems. Everything I enjoyed in the morning is collapsed during the day. We think we know what the future holds but the reality is that we don't know nothing. One day you have a government, the next day you don't have it. One day you have the Amazon rainforest , the next day you don't have it.",21Aug2019,1
123,"When you are used to and can control your adrenaline and your instincts in the face of potential harm, you are less likely to, for instance, shoot an unarmed man reaching for his wallet. 

But good cops in that case would likely, in some way, lead to kids who didn't fight as much. Who would by that logic become bad cops. Who let the fights ensue.",21Aug2019,4
