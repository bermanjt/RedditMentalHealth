0,"So, I'll keep this short, because the backstory is quite cliche. Southern conservative Baptist fundamentalist family. Red all the way down. I was raised military, patriot, and god-fearing. Real fucked up shit if you're willing to ask any questions. I think my father was trying to raise some fusion of John Wayne and Jesus Christ. I'm convinced conservatism is a mental disorder from all I've been through. Anyway, I've been trying to bridge the gap between my father and me. The war softened him. He's been around more often, and has been trying to be supportive, and I've been slowly opening him to things like saying ""I love you"" and showing emotions. It's a long process, like reconnaissance. We were talking, and, as it always does, things funneled into religious discussion. I'm a nontheistic nihilist. I believe what we experience after we die is the same thing we experienced before we were born: intangible nothing. Like the space between sleep and dream. He is a hardcore Christian, though one that is quite confused. He's a protestant that respects the pope. He believes in a Christian nation and is career military. That kind of cognitive dissonance. He starts going on about how Jesus is the reason he pulls through each day. I tell him that, while Jesus had a very good idea about how to respect humanity, he thought the best thing he could do was to die for everyone, whereas my father was sacrificing as he lives for the benefit of others. I told him I love and respect him, and looked up to him more than someone thousands of years ago. My father then said that he believes in Jesus, and he believes in the devil. And that, he believes the devil may be using me to mislead and manipulate others through my words and actions. But, through Jesus, we will all find the right way.

So, if you want a look into the Bible belt, there you go. Welcome to hell. I look up to my father, so I'm a tool of the devil. Well, I *did* look up to him, anyway.",01Aug2019,2
1,"My cat found 2 baby mice and left them on the ground totally unharmed. I got some evaporated milk and a syringe and fed them every couple hours. I figured they would die, but they lived! I started getting kinda attached to them. They were still blind and trying to walk but always fell over like a turtle on its back.

 I used to have pet mice as a child, so I figured if they made it, maybe they could be mine. Last night I named them Ragweed and Rye, the two brothers. 

This morning I woke up and Rye (the little one) was dead :( Later Ragweed died too, curled up to his brother. I don’t know if there’s something else I could have done. My mom made a little cross out of sticks and buried them in my garden. 

RIP little guys!!!",01Aug2019,2
2,"Recently having a shit time in life and my confidence and self esteem have been shot. I’m doing a lot better this year than I was last year. 

I’ve been working out and getting back into shape. I was dating for a bit (I got out of a long term relationship last year) and it was going well but I just don’t think I’m ready for that. I have been getting a lot of compliments lately about how much weight I’ve lost and how great I look but I’d still like shed another 8-10 lbs. 

I don’t think I’m hideous or anything but I don’t feel attractive or confident. I always feel so self conscious and I’m constantly comparing myself to other girls. I’m anxious around guys because I feel like they don’t find me attractive or I’m afraid of what they’ll think when they see me naked. 

I don’t know why. I feel like I used to be so comfortable and confident in my own skin. I also feel like I’ve changed a lot as a person in the past few years and I’m still working on feeling comfortable with me now.

Any advice or tips on how to become more confident?",01Aug2019,2
3,"I graduated high school in 2013 and went to college because thats what my whole family wanted. I had no idea what to study, but since I liked to write I went with journalism.

I’ve since graduated and worked one job as a small town journalist, writing/designing/managing the web content for a twice a week paper. 

Eventually the company that owned the paper went bankrupt and the people who bought it treated everyone badly and most everyone left, including myself.

Then my former boss, who had been laid off in the transition, helped me get a new job halfway across the country at his old paper.

I packed up everything I own in my car and drove out there, found an apartment over the weekend and started this week.

But now I’m here, I hardly know anyone, I’ll be working a difficult job with long hours and low pay and I just regret everything.

I should have been a computer programmer or graphic designer or doctor or vet or just anything else really.

I should have asked my dad to help me get a job at the phone company.

I think this will pass once I calm down a little, but I dunno. The anxiety is eating me up.",01Aug2019,1
5,"We haven't seen each other in a few months and we're meeting tomorrow but I can't be bothered. 


I know that I'm the asshole in this situation but I fucking hate her attitude, it's so immature. (Though I'm immature too so can't really speak). The main thing that pisses me off right now is how easily she stresses. For example, today she said ""I never come early because when I do I always think that people have ditched me and that everyone around me is judging me."" Like idk man, you're going to uni in September yet you're worried about being alone? Idk grow up, she's so sheltered. I think it just annoys me because I really value punctuality and probably because I never had it as easy as her. She complains about the dumbest things. Like how public transport is scary and she prefers to get driven into central London instead. My parents would never do that, it's a waste of their time and money. Tbh it shocks me that she would willingly be a nuisance to her parents. Even if they offer something like that, I think you should decline. Another thing that annoys me is that she doesn't want a job. Stupid thing to annoy me I know.  She says she doesn't spend money but she does besides a job is not just for money in the present. I don't understand how she doesn't feel guilt when taking from her parents. Or how does she not worry about her financial future? It's better to start saving now. She also says she cares about the environment but insists on driving her car, yes her car, her parents bought her a car. I would feel uncomfortable with such a present. 


I know that I'm totally in the wrong here. But I don't tell her this, I support her and calm her down even though I disagree. So at least I'm not an active asshole, just a thinking one. I'm probably just jealous that she has a loving family who wants to help her and that her family has financial stability, unlike mine. But despite that, there's nothing more in the world that I hate than immature kids. I didn't have it hard in life, I had it good but man I didn't have it this easy. 



Maybe the true thing that annoys me is none of the things I listed above. It's more her attitude of not wanting to change herself. She says ""I'm useless lol"" ""I don't want to do x"" ""I don't like y"". These are permanent statements, I fucking hate that. I don't understand why you wouldn't want to become a better person? I'm a really shitty person and I know that, so I always try and make myself better. I had depression and was suicidal for 5 years, no one helped me but myself. I had no therapist and my friend didn't really understand when I finally snapped and told her how I felt. I had to work by myself to make myself a better person and to get out of that shitty situation because nobody wanted to help me and I didn't want to burden anyone. Yet she doesn't want to change. How can she not realise that she's the cause of her own problems? Does she really expect life to be so easy? I think it's pretty lame. 


I know I'm not mature either because a mature wouldn't write such horrible things about their best friend. I'd never said it, I did try but it resulted in nothing. I don't know. I kinda wish I had it this easy.",01Aug2019,1
6,"In my 7th or 8th grade Tech Ed class, my teacher told me when I kept forgetting to go down &amp; work on my house; that I ""didn't care enough...."". As the years went by I started to relate this to everyday life. I would ask myself a lot of the time, ""do I care enough?"" Boiled down I feel like this is the other....""sigh""?

8,"I've had this done to me in at least 15 conversations. I don't watch the news. If you turn the news on, it would be like walking into Season 5 of the Game of Thrones for me, I won't know who even a tenth of those people are. Don't talk to me about news.

9,"How can you prove its existence with certainty? It's impossible in my mind as everything can be attributed to probability. I try to be understanding but during hard times is when one is being truly tested. I'm at my wits. I want to give up and just leave it all. Seeing my dead face in the mirror 15 minutes ago when brushing teeth, combined with my recent misfortunes-- killed my mental state. I feel like I'm not making any progress and I want to change something but I just fucking can't, no matter what I do or how I do it. How do I get out of this shitty loop? This is infuriating! I'm angry! It has been 3 years that passed and I'm standing on thr9same grounds as I did 3 fucking years ago.  People around me tell me I make progress but it just does not show. I want to give up! I do!!!!! But I must stay strong for my surroundings! Do I have to be immoral to find success???? Is this my destiny?? With every passing fucking day it certainly does! No change! 0 ! Despite all the work there is still 0 change!!!! Why do others tell me there is change when I don't see it, the numbers do not show it?! Am I fooling myself? What is this mockery? This is embarrassing! So much time!!!!!!!!! And effort-----!!!!!! 0 is all I see!!!!!!!! No change despite all this struggle, will, neediness, duty, obligation, belief!!! Anger and frustration is all I feel! And I cannot share this with whom it needs to be shared! I fucking hate it all!

We grew up vaguely knowing of each other/and our families and have tons of mutual friends and connections we didn’t know about. Growing up being the slightly overweight kid/teen I was, and her being the drop dead gorgeous girl she was, me and all of my friends regarded her as way out of our league. 
Fast forward about 8 years, and not only have I become much better looking(thank god for puberty and testosterone lol), but as I’ve gotten to know her, not only is she even more beautiful but her personality, cadence, etc, all I can say is wow.

14,"I’ve (17M) noticed I’ve been getting pretty judgmental and bitter the past year or so. I’m starting to fixate on things that I don’t like about people - oftentimes things they have no control over, and if they do, it’s almost always harmless things that I have no business critiquing. I’m starting to enjoy things less in general as a result, and I’ve gotten a bit reclusive. I’m just displeased.

The old adage that what you hate in others is what you hate about yourself is true in this case. I have pretty low self-esteem. The thing is, if you look up how to raise your self-esteem, most of the replies will tell you to make goals and take steps to reach them, increasing your self-confidence in the process. But I do have goals, and I’m working towards achieving them, but I’m always going to move the goalposts. There’s always gonna be something I could have done a bit better, or something I want to accomplish next. I want to learn to - and this is going to sound cheesy as shit - just accept myself as is, maybe even like myself. I’m hoping once I do that I’ll stop projecting so much hatred onto everybody. Does anyone have any advice on how to do this?",01Aug2019,7
15,"I’ve had a rough few months, but you know what? It’s going to be ok. Let me just spill the tea on myself.

Firstly, I have been diagnosed with bipolar depression. However, I’ve been doing so well that for the first time in seven years, I can start to come off being on any type of medication for my mood. My doctor is working on weening me off of my current medication, and I am very pleased with this decision. I feel like I’m experiencing the world differently now that I’m on a very low dosage. I feel like I can feel more. I feel more awake? Like there’s no fog. I don’t know, but I’ve been kind of snappy because I’ve been experiencing a little bit of withdrawal. It’s nothing major. I can handle it, and it’s getting better with time. I have been quite a bitch lately though, but that’s fine because I usually let people walk all over me 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

As the title says, I took 16 credit hours this summer. I like to think I have a proactive approach to coping with my symptoms, and one of the best ways of doing this is staying busy for me. I’ll admit there were times I was a tad overwhelmed, but it wasn’t more than I could handle. I’m about to pass all of my classes with an A again. 

My birds died a few weeks ago. They were quite old. I know people have a hard time keeping parakeets because they’re so sensitive, but my Bilbo and Spock lived a whole six years. I miss them a lot, but I think they’d be happy to know I’m taking care of two new birdies. 

I have a lot of stories in my history about my job. I work in a faculty office where I go to college. So maybe you guys won’t be surprised that I got a little too close with one of my professors last semester? We were generally attracted to each other, and it probably wouldn’t have gone as far as it did if I didn’t spend so much time at work where he also happened to be. He asked me out after he submitted my grades (he’s a weirdo so he said “maybe you and I should go out and get some... iced tea”), and I panicked and said no (which was the correct answer btw) and I had doubts, and I missed him, so I sent him an email saying we needed to discuss iced tea because I was very overwhelmed with my emotions. So he said he’d be there (at work) next week. And he never came lol. I consulted coworkers who’ve known him for years and we concluded that he was just unaware that it would hurt my feelings and he will continue being a fuckboy when I see him fall semester. I’m ready, John. 

Lastly, I have lost about 2/3 of my hair in the last year or two. This is devastating for a girl who’s looks are very important to her. We couldn’t figure out what was going on until I went to a doctor the other day and we found out I had an autoimmune disorder. This sucks because it may be hard to treat, but at least I have a real treatment plan now! 

Classes end next week and I shall have three weeks of summer left. I’m going to go on a small vacation and enjoy until next semester.",01Aug2019,8

17,"This is mostly because of the school. ITS HUGE compared to my previous one. A teacher said that classes could be half a mile from each other. For most freshmen this isn’t an issue because their classes are in one hallway. But in my case, I have sophomore classes and have to speed and around to opposite ends on the school in 4 mins. 

The school also doesn’t have the best reputation.  Everyone says that there’s gangs and drugs in the school. I had a cousin who went their and said that she experienced someone taking out REAL cocaine on the bus, but that was years ago so it may not be that bad now. I’ve just hear really bad thing about the kids in the school

One thing that really terrifies me is that after high school I’m supposed to be an adult. I am, in no capacity, ready to have the responsibilities that come with being an adult and don’t see how in the next four years I’m going to get there. I don’t know even what know what I want to do with my life. I have so many interests but none of them are stable enough to be an actual job. I’m not even sure if want to go to college.  My parents aren’t very supportive of that and think that I’ll get nowhere without the extra 4 years of education.I just don’t want to waste my life getting a degree that I’ll never use.

I’ve talked with people who have been through high school and they all say that I’m going to be fine which instills no confidence in me. I honestly don’t know what they could’ve to said to make me feel better. I just have this feeling that high school is going to be the worst 4 years of my life.

Also, my personal preference is freshly shredded cheese. I think it melts way better than the bagged shredded at the store.


**Ingredients**


* 1 lb rigatoni, cooked


* 1/4 cup (half stick of butter), melted


* 12 oz can evaporated milk


* 1 1/2 cups 2% milk


* 1 lb shredded cheese *(I use 8 oz Muenster, 4 oz sharp cheddar, 4 oz Colby Jack)*


* 2 large eggs, beaten



* 2 teaspoons mustard powder



* 1 can Campbell's condensed cheddar cheese soup (can be substituted for 6 oz shredded cheese)


* Salt and pepper to taste


* Paprika to cover



**Directions**


* Mix together melted butter and beaten eggs


* *If using condensed soup, mix with milk here. If not, skip ahead*


* Add evaporated milk to egg and butter mixture, followed by 2% milk *(or 2% milk and soup mixture, if that's what you're using)*


* Mix salt, pepper,  and powdered mustard in


* Pour into crock pot, and fold in the shredded cheese, reserving some to top before cooking


* Fold in cooked noodles and top with reserved cheese and paprika


* Cook on low for 3 hours and 15 minutes



I know that this is super unhealthy and ultra cheesey; but it makes for a delicious side, is easy to mix veggies in (for picky little ones), and is something that can be easily be made on a budget.

21,"I’m F19 and he’s M18. I think it’s safe to say that we maintained the ex no contact thing for a year. We broke up because I went to college and he was still in high school, pretty typical first love type thing I was really in love with him and devastated when we first broke up, but I matured a lot after that and learned so much. It was a ROUGH break up.

I am personally at the point where I know we won’t get back together (more like won’t allow it) so if he wants to talk to me, it’s whatever. I’m really just trying to be as civil and nice as possible— that’s why I even responded to him. 

I do not see him in the same way that I used to. We hadn’t talked AT ALL since breaking up and purged all our accounts on social media. 

He dated another girl after me for a few months and it’s life— I get it but I soon as they broke up he followed me on Instagram. This is the first reason for me questioning it. 

Anyways, he texted me now basically a month after following me saying “hey is this your number” and I said “yeah, how are you doing?” then he replied “I’m good thanks but I was wondering if you could unblock me on snap cause I wanted to see if there’s any old pictures of me “ 

First, what the fuck....

Who asks that for the first time talking to an ex since a messy break up? Not even a “how are you” or “I’m sorry” 

Also, what is with the slowly adding me on every social media back. And the texting... I’m just super confused WHY he would ask for old pictures in our snap when he can find them on other social media... almost seems like an excuse to add me on snap... (which I did add him back)... but I don’t know if his intentions would be to get back with me.

I hope I’m not leading him on...  I went through the photos in our chat &amp; it’s all stuff from when we were dating, nothing of JUST him. Hmmmm....??? If he’s tryna smash why hasn’t he just boldly said it yet... 

TLDR; ex texts me for the first time in a year asking for me to unblock him on snap (when he wasn’t blocked) for the purpose of “looking for old pictures of him saved in our chat” but I suspect an ulterior motive...",01Aug2019,1

Here’s where things start to diverge from the expected.  Neither of us identify as gay and we aren’t wanting to explore our chemistry sexually.  From our experiences and some soul searching we are exploring an option we are both excited about:

We want to be committed, celibate best friends. 

What that means to me is we are friends, not sexually intimate, but intimate in every other way.  Like how childhood best friends are close.  We won’t be the only friends we have but we will be the one we keep returning to.

29,"I've always thought that life is meaningless without goals, so, since I was a kid I try to set my sight to something. And I'm really into planning. 

When I was in high school, I over-researched about University and I studied super hard for it, and college turned out to be just ok. When I was in college, I immediately thought of how to get a good job, switching major to make sure I'll get paid well after school. 

And now, now I'm making comfortable salary, I have a partner that loves me, and we plan to get married soon, life seems sweet on paper. 

I just feel kinda exhausted that I'm always planning in my head - what to do with the next raise? When should we buy a home? Should we have kids etc. I researched on all type of houses, the potential raise I'll get from work, ways to have kids if we turns out to be infertile, I overthink and over-researched all the time.

38,"So I am now a senior in high school, which starts Aug 12th. The other three years I was incredibly depressed and really did not do my best, but this year I want to do an entire 180 to get myself back on track for college. At this point I’m not even sure how many credits I’m missing, and since summer is over I obviously can’t make them up this summer. To put it simply, I am terrified that I will fail school because my family will disown me etc. but my school just absolutely sucks and I can’t afford to transfer now, just as I hadn’t been able to these past years. The administration and counselors suck and absolutely will not help me (a good example is that they put me in trig my FRESHMAN year and refused to switch me out, causing me to fail, and repeating this again the next year.) All of this and the combination of other personal things made me incredibly depressed and so I just kinda gave up, but now I really want to get past that and work my hardest. So my question is: since the probability of me probably missing 6-7 credits is high, will I be able to make them up in time, and if so, how can I? Thank you!",01Aug2019,2
39,"She's got PTSD and ocd. I've got ADD. I haven't slept for more than a few hours in months. I can't find a job in my field and my dad is carrying on about how I shouldn't work anything else in the meantime. She called me and told me I was an extreme disappointment and hung up. Later my dad, her , and I had a three way call and she ""apologized"" because she didn't get the full story and her pride was hurt, or something. I can't sleep tonight. I took a unisom(sleeping pill) and my girlfriend's lit up lavender because her mom said it's helps relax people. She's asleep next to me, and it's peaceful looking at her. She's not crying because she feels bad for me anymore. She's just resting. Someday, I will rest. I will pay my own bills. I will have my own debts. I will live in a home that her and I have chosen together. I will buy what I want without repercussion. I will do what I want without repercussion. I am 26 years old and have no confidence because of how they both broke me down over the years. They taught me that I can't trust anyone but family, but then they both taught me that you can't always trust your spouse. So who am i meant to trust?

I have nightmares about her leaving me, when I do sleep that is. I have stress dreams about my family often, and I know it's because I have so many unresolved problems with both my mother and my father. My mother blames menopause for everything she does wrong or she claims that we have no right to be upset at her for the hurtful things she says to us because ""it's a joke."" I did not find it particularly funny when you made a comment about how my girlfriend couldn't come over to visit because she, ""had to visit her mom and go to the gym,"" as you said in a mocking tone. She did have to do that; her mother has cancer. That supercedes a random visit to my parents house. 

I am exhausted. I just graduated and am realizing that I learned only art theory and no practical skills. Yes I have the skills from my own experience but, even though I have that, no one is hiring. The money I have is left over from the college fund and it's rapidly running dry. 

I hate my life. I try and remind myself that I have a wonderful girlfriend who truly loves me and I feel the same for her but I can't shake this dread. I've had most of my life but now that I've graduated the darkness seems much greater than any time before. I will never harm myself, it would hurt the woman I love, the brother I must protect, and, even though I have my problems with them and they are the cause 95% of the stress, anguish, and self-loathing I have, my parents. Also, I'm afraid to die and I have no desire to die, not really. I sometimes wish I was dead but I believe most people do at some point.

In my youth, my mother was my safe parent. In adulthood she has hurt me almost as much as my father. She was cold and heartless when I tried to be honest with my feelings, she called every Tuesday and Thursday before one class in particular and would rant and rave. Once she made me skip class, which after our conversations was a usual happenstance because I would be so emotionally drained, so that I could help her plan a divorce between her and my dad. For 3 hours straight. By Thursday she decided against it and acted like it was nothing. She tells me that she knows what I think, but when she speaks on it she is always wrong. Today she accused me of telling my girlfriend that the reason I hate the outdoors, which I don't, is because she didn't like bugs and so I don't like bugs because she wouldn't take me out there as a child. Her comment on how disappointing I am will never leave me. Her fake apology will never leave me. My explaining that I couldn't handle any more talk today after 2 hours of sleep and her saying, ""fine, bye,"" and hanging up without saying anything else, will never leave me. But the thing that hurts me the most is what she said to me one year into dating my girlfriend. ""Don't ruin her."" I have thought about that almost everyday that I've spent with my girlfriend. It's seared into my mind and it will never leave me. The constant fear of being a destructive force in my girlfriend's life was something I was always afraid of and now. My mother. My safe parent. The woman who told me that it was okay when I cried as young boy. The woman who stopped my father from screaming at me. The woman who told me everyday at 5 years old that she wished she could run away. Told me not to ruin the woman who had chosen to have a relationship with me. 

I hope that anyone reading this doesn't read my tone as being angry or fast paced. I'm actually typing quite slowly and with an odd sense of tragic clarity. I despise my life. I despise the family who trained me to trust only them. I despise my mother for what she's done to me emotionally and I can never truly feel at ease with my father after the abuse he made us all suffer until only a few years ago. I feel hatred. No matter how aware I am that this hatred is actually just misguided sadness and self-loathing for never being the perfect child, or man, I was meant to be. 

But beside me is a woman whom I dearly cherish and who is peacefully resting beside me. I know that she will wake for work in the morning and feel a twinge of sorrow knowing that I have yet another long, exhausting day ahead of me. I know she will message me tomorrow and ask how I am and send me various articles and cutesy gifs to take my mind of the comment that was made to me, and though those things may fall upon muffled ears, they are not deafened. Not yet. And with her love I may see the better side of this life.",01Aug2019,2

I’m unsure I will be able to I isolated myself after graduating and am doing it again. Seems like a cycle. The main reason I’ve isolated myself is I see my friend headed down a dark path talking about drinking and sleeping around. I can’t stand hearing about it and while I do support them no matter what I can’t stand to hear it. They’re also severely depressed as they’ve expressed but refuse to get help and I just can’t handle seeing them like they are.

44,"Crosspost from usmcboot. Might be a little hard to understand to someone who hasn’t had an affiliation to the military but I explained it as much as I could just for reference, a PFC is a E2, second lowest rank in the military. A Cpl is an E4, a sgt is an E5

I’m not sure where to start, so much is happening it’s hard to keep up. 

Throwaway account because. (I’m praying the people who know about this aren’t here..) 

So. Today I checked into my first duty station. I left home feeling nervous and as I got here I started calming down. I was picked up by 2 cpls. They were in the front, me in the back. They were talking about “I thought we were picking up your replacement?” I didn’t think a more about it. I started using my phone. 

As the day went on it all clicked with what information I was given. I’m in a HQ company. We are in charge of 3 to 5 (i believe?) companies. 

Back to “replacement” well, turns out me, a PFC is the replacement for a CPL.. once he leaves in 9 days I will be on my own managing 5 (same MOS) from those companies HQ is in charge of. 

My chain of command includes, me then a SSGT above me. 

When I was talking to the Cpl I said, “here’s my thing..”  “yeah?” “How am I, a PFC supposed to be in charge of 5 other (MOS) when they’ve had more time on the job than I have?” He answered with “chuckle, you just know when they’re doing dumb stuff, you just gotta catch it before (he named an agency or something) catches it” and explained the chain of command. The companies, us (HQ), and of all goes wrong and named some place or agency idk. 

How am I supposed to do this? I’m just some dumb PFC how can I be expected to manage sgts and cpls? How does this even happen? How does a boot straight from MOs school gets out in this type of position? Nothing is how I imaged it would be. We don’t PT, we go to chow on our own, we set our own schedules, we get 2 hours for lunch (what the fuck?), my MOS is supposed to be outside doing their MOS, I hated it when I learned this but I came expecting the worse, turns out my job is at a desk, 2 monitors and AC. ????? I’m freaking out.

Edit: and what’s even worse is that we have an upcoming event where we’re going across an ocean. Cpl said “I’m not going to lie to you, it’s going to be really hard, you came at the worst time possible but you’re going to do fine, I have faith in you” CUNT?? HOW? DIFJJEIFKFFJD 9 days to learn, next month we are deploying or whatever it’s fucking called and even after all of that you tell me how it’s going to be hard af then you too it off by putting more pressure on me by “I have faith in you” dkfiejfk HOW?",01Aug2019,1

47,"I’m an 19 (M) soon to be community college student,  and i took a year before deciding to actually go ahead and go back to school.

My main issues with school has always been that i feel like im not a very good student, at least from what my high school c’s told me. I am also incredibly self conscious and insecure, with a bit of anxiety and obesity , it’s a horrible combo to have while smack dab in the middle of our most formative years in high school.  It’s worse considering i live in a small town in texas where the culture is heavily drifted towards super confident athletic or incredibly smart boys and girls. Either way, let’s just say i high school was definitely one of my least enjoyed periods of existence.


I am not blind to the fact college is a different experience from high school, but one of my big issues that i can’t let go of certain things. 

Well regardless, i finally decided to suck it up and go ahead sign up for some classes. 

If there’s anything i want to study for it is detective work, or forensic work, it really fascinates me, i am just skeptical i am smart enough for such a field, or even if i can overcome my anxiety and insecurity for a second to show up for my first class this semester.

I just really want to be someone, not in a famous sense that everyone knows my name or anything, but just someone who is doing something they like or even love with a strong confidence and be able to face the world with their head held up high.

My parents are both immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador so i am the first of my family to study and have to ability to do something with myself apart from working minimum wage jobs or soul crushing plant work.

I just want to make them proud, or so i say, truth is as much as i love them and recognize the incredibly hard work they’ve done, i don’t want to do it just for them, i want to it for me, i want to actually feel happy, and proud of something I’ve done for once, I’m just super insecure about my ability to accomplish it.

I apologize for the long rant but it’s just something that i need off my brain, whether it
be spoken or written.


If you did stick around and read my insane ramblings thank you for your time, i hope you have a nice day, or a good night.

48,"I’ve had depression for a couple of years now but it’s considered a “high-functioning depression,” besides the times when it’s at its absolute worse (did have a couple of “really bad” weeks, when I didn’t leave bed for school/work and had bad consequences; but this is usually not the case). Although I am genuinely thankful that I can go to school, work, socialize most times that I need to, this also means that most people would never imagine/believe that I am depressed. 

For this reason, I refused to tell anyone (besides my therapist) about my depression for the first year of being diagnosed. After the first year, there were a few conversations when it “naturally” got brought up, but I noticed most people were terrible at pretending to care. No one was mean about it, but many of them seemed doubtful or tried connecting it to the times they were also sad, which didn’t help me. On top of this, I am known to be a funny and bubbly person, so no one really seemed to like this side of me, the rare times it showed.

So I stopped wanting to bring it up to anyone. But really recently, I had to bring it up to someone because of a specific incident that required explanation. To my surprise, this person not only listened, but kept checking up on me afterwards. Every time I showed even the smallest sign of feeling down, they always made sure I was doing okay. 

Today, I told the person that my depression has been terrible for the past couple of days. I was nervous to bring it up. Then this friend started bawling. She genuinely cared and empathized. I have never felt so comforted before. I thanked her and came home. I thought about what happened in the shower and realized this person is so important to me. That’s it.

All my friends have gone out of my life. I hang out with a pair from time to time but I can tell it’s not the same anymore..

About to enter my second year of university and well, I don’t know what terms I’m on with people I met my first year. I started talking to this group of people but they all dorm and I commute, so there’s this weird feeling when I’m with them. They’re nice but it just sucks not being able to be with them all the time like they are (since they all dorm). 

To be honest, near the middle of my senior year in high school, I notice now that I kind of started to push everyone away from me.. friends, family.. Ended up being an out cast except for a few good friends. Was fine up until now. I literally just have no idea how to communicate with people anymore and I’m scared of not “being cool” as funny as that sounds.

56,"TL;DR: For a long time I've wanted to be a doctor, and as I am just about to start on the path to doing so, I've been having growing fears that I may not actually like it, and will be left with no other options.

I'm 18 and just graduated high school, in the fall I will be attending my first pick school (University of Texas at Austin) to study biochemistry and I am planning on pursuing an MD after undergrad and working in the healthcare field. This is what I've wanted to do with my life since 8th grade, and it's all I've ever known, in high school all my slots for classes were dedicated to health and natural sciences forgoing any courses which would immerse me in any other field. However, something changed in me this summer when I went to my freshman orientation, I think I realized that there is a whole world out there of people living their lives with entirely different priorities and goals than I, what I mean to say is there are people who have always and will always try to do what makes them happy, but that wasn't how I came to realize my dream of working in the heath care field. When I was that directionless, naive 8th grader I wanted to become a doctor because I had determined it was the best way for me to make a meaningful impact on the world, that I would be able to die happy knowing that I had helped so many people to live healthier and longer lives. And while that very well may be, I had never considered if I would *live* happy. When I was younger, I don't think I cared about my personal happiness in the matter, I saw any adversity I would face in my future as a noble sacrifice for the greater good. But since then I've changed, and I honestly don't think I had realized until that orientation. I've come to learn there's more to life than simply taking what I may deem to be the most righteous path, It's about living well, living happy.

So that's the situation but here is the problem: I don't even know where to begin figuring out if there is something else I would want to do, and I fearful I am running out of time. As previously mentioned, throughout all of my schooling so far, I have experienced nothing outside of this field, so if there were an occupation out there I would enjoy more, I don't know how I would find it. And to complicate things, looking at who I am as a person, I consider it highly possible that healthcare does just so happen to be that thing. I do really enjoy learning about the human body and many of the related fields (by far my favorite subject in high school was chemistry, which relates to my major so I have built myself a small escape hatch at the end of the next 4 yeas). Also I personally believe I have the characteristics necessary for such a strenuous career, I proved that to myself in high school in which there were some periods of my life where all my time was dedicated to either school, study, or the gym. I also work well under high stress situations and never struggle with remaining on task. But despite all that I am afraid it isn't what's best for me, I'm afraid I'll become yet another one of the nearly 50% of residents/doctors who burn out, and possibly hate their life for it. The life of a burnout doctor is so frightening to me because not only do they hate the position they are in, but they had to make sacrifices to get there. I am afraid that, just like in high school, I will pass up opportunities for socializing or dating, in relentless pursuit of success. I cant help but imagining myself as an old, lonely, unhappy bitter man who ruined his life doing what he thought he was meant to do.

But most importantly, what I fear more than the problem itself, is the lack of control I will soon have, I fear I'm running out of time to change my life for the better. You see, biochemistry is not a very competitive major for those who don't know. Had I applied for any of the more serious majors at the university (computer science, engineering, business) I can assure you I would not have gotten in, and it is for that reason I fear the option to change my life has already surpassed me, as I see it an highly improbable I could switch majors at this point, at least not without enrolling an a different university. and frankly speaking, an undergraduate biochemistry degree is not worth much, there are not many successful career options from that point. Leaving my options to an MD, or a Ph.D (possibly both depending on the career I want to pursue) if I want to live a life which affords me (and hopefully my future family) comfort and success. Not to be misconstrued, both of the aforementioned options I am open to and even excited about pursing, but I am becoming hopelessly afraid I will reach the summit only to realize I hate it, and there will be nothing I can do about it, and no one to blame but myself.

As this upcoming school year approaches I can't help but feel the grip of the golden handcuffs closing in, I will be on the path to achieving everything I ever wanted, but at what cost?

End note: I am fully aware that the thing I am feeling are probably common of someone at this particular point in life. A month from now I will be living a radically different life than anything I have ever experienced with its own host of difficulties and freedoms and frankly changes scares me, I think it scares all of us in some way. But recognizing the commonality or even the insignificance of these thoughts do not make them any less real, nor any less painful for me to think through day, by day, by day. So I suppose I'm posting this in the hopes that someone who has gone through a similar struggle, as I am sure many have, has some guidance for me. I haven't even started school yet and I can already feel my mental state rapidly spiraling out of control, I just want to stop feeling what I am feeling, and fearing what I am fearing.

End end note: I would like to sincerely thank anyone who took the time to read through this thread and/or respond, I understand reading through such a long-winded personal story may not be particularly appealing to most, but your willingness to do so I appreciate in a way words could not describe.",01Aug2019,2

63,"I’ve been with my partner for nearly 4 years and I have always enjoyed our sex. I have always been more submissive but lately when I’m not in control I feel upset, scared and hurt. Sometimes I feel during sex that I’m there for his pleasure only which in my rational brain I know isn’t true as he has and always does take into account my pleasure.These feelings have suddenly arrived in the last month with no cause I can definitely see. However about a year ago I was molested by a stranger in public. I went to the police and didn’t seem to have issues with sex until now. I’m just wondering if this could cause these issues later on?

64,"When I was 10, me and my sister ran away from our abusive, drug-addict, bipolar mom, across the country to my dad. 

My dad was neck deep in debt, poor, and with horrible anger-management skills. He become emotinally and mentally abusive. I completely broke down, I wasnt a person anymore, just a numb fucking shell, but I pretended to not be and people thought I was fine. 

My sister moved out when I was 12, and it was only me and my dad. Everything got worse. I stopped trying to be happy, and only tried to avoid getting yelled at. 

When I was 13, I ran away to a family I knew, and refused to go home. They supported me, and after just living there for seven months, I was officially their foster child. Between the panic attacks and break-downs, I started healing. My empty shell started becoming a person again. I lived in a loving home, something I had never experienced before. 

Now I'm 16, turning 17 in november, and I'm moving to my own apartement today. Yesterday I was doing the final shopping and packing with my foster dad, and we spend hours preparing a meal together, and played board games until way to late at night. I was completely happy the entire day, and what I have now is what I dreamed of having 5 years ago. 

I'm going to visit them way too often and celebrate christmas etc with them. 

I'm going to live in my own place, I have a family who loves and supports me, I'm going to a good school with great friends and I have a stable life in fronter of me. Not a single one of the cards I was drakt would allow me live a normal and good life, yet here I am. Apart from a traumatic past, I have no other issues than what you would expect from a 16 year old girl, and nothing could have prepared me for that. 

Idk what the purpose of this post is, I'm just do happy. I guess the takeaway can be that there is always hope, I just wanted to share this, because I cannot believe how lucky I am",01Aug2019,1332

I decided that I can't live like this any longer, so I've set myself a challenge.

I'm gonna try and shower and brush my teeth for every single day in August - well maybe not shower *everyday,* but enough to get myself back on the tracks and start getting into a habit of doing it. I've been feeling a lot better since that low point in mid-July, so I'm gonna try and get myself back together while I'm not feeling totally down.

67,"Tldr: I love complaining, but this affects everyone else in my life and they don't want to talk to me. I want to find a way to stop complaining to have healthy relationships and to keep myself in check, emotionally.

I love complaining. I just noticed this when I saw that people started showing physical signs of being disinterested in what I was saying. I like talking out my problems and then fixing them as I speak out loud. But in a lot of cases, this means I have to talk to someone.

My parents are not helpful because they just assume the worst - that I have a problem with everything. My friends don't want to keep talking to me - and I get it, because after all, they're not my shrinks. They don't have to give a damn about my problems if I'm always complaining. I don't want to confide in my colleagues because that's dangerous. Even when I think I want to rant on r/rant, people weigh in. And that annoys me because they're strangers who want to make their opinions heard. And I can't blame them - by posting on a forum where upvotes, downvotes and comments are allowed, I am letting people have their opinion on my rants. I don't like ""letting things be"" so I can't go without retorting to someone who pushed my buttons through a comment.

I rant because I'm frustrated and instead of smoking up, smoking, drinking or masturbating, I rant. I think this is healthier, but when I think about it, my emotional well-being probably isn't too good if I'm always thinking of complaints.

How can I fight the need to complain all the time? I need a healthier mindset, and healthier relationships with people and I don't think this complaint road is something I should go down farther.

Thanks in advance!",01Aug2019,3
68,"People are telling me left and right that I'm selfish, spoiled, ungrateful and just generally a very self-centered person with no empathy.
At first I brushed it off, because it's not how I see myself, but recently my boyfriend has jumped on the train and I am trying to understand where this is coming from.

I feel like I'm a nice person. I want the best for others, am positive and encouraging. I love sharing, be it food or my guest room. I'm a good listener. People always come to me to get advice. 

But I don't go out of my way to be a good person anymore. I got out of a shitty relationship and afterwards, I was really fed up with devoting my time and attention to people who make me miserable. I felt like I had to prioritize myself for once. But my current boyfriend is less than happy with that, just like my friends. 

Examples: 
- Friends meet up out of town on a workday, I don't meet them because I'll have to get up much earlier than them in the morning and don't function well on too little sleep.
- Boyfriend threw a birthday party, I had 4 job interviews on the day and couldn't come. Offered to drop by afterwards but he was sad about it.
- I like going to bed early, boyfriend likes staying up late (recent development) and I refuse to stay up with him.
- Friends tell me I'm a shitty friend because I rarely make time to see them, but I'm exhausted after work and they always meet up late (after 11pm).
- I don't visit my parents often because they live hours away and petrol is expensive, but they think I should drive to see them anyway at least once a week.
- and if I had an exhausting day, I shut off my phone to get some peace. Boyfriend initially approved of this, but is now put off by the frequency of this happening and thinks I'm a total asshole because I should be sharing my troubles with him instead of dropping off the face of the earth for a night. 

Overall, I always get told that my behaviour is extremely selfish. I merely feel like I'm taking care of myself though. Where's the line? How can I tell if I'm really being selfish? I do put my needs before others these days, but I feel like that's healthy.",01Aug2019,2
69,Hey guys. I used to be an energetic kid with lots of plans. That was 8 years ago. I'm. 25 now and dont have a job and living with my parents. All of the plans I made and vowed to pursue was all gone. It seems that the rush of planning and executing those things aren't as exhilarating as before. I wake up-eat breakfast- watch TV fall asleep -wake up-take a bath-go to reddit- stare blankly at the trees with no emotion- go to reddit- dinner-take a bath again then sleep. Its been like this for 3 months now and its driving me crazy. I can't find anything fun anymore. I don't want to get a job cause I don't want a 9-5. What's wrong with me? Am I just lazy??,01Aug2019,6
70,"Before you read: please don't come for me for posting this because I'm not exposing anybody, nobody here knows me or my sister's identity. I just want to know what I could tell her to help her feel better about herself.

Hello, my little sister recently told me that she values other people's opinions much more than her own and that she always feels ugly. She is barely even a teenager, still in middle school, actually, and she like just asked me how to love herself..? For some more background knowledge, my sister is a highly sensitive person (don't know why) and really takes a lot of things people say to her to heart. As an older role model, I was at a loss for words. 

She's also told me before that she feels like the ugliest person in her friend group and she wants to do self care and be confident in herself and I told her the key was acceptance in her flaws and in who she is as a person but I was pretty bad at explaining it and it didn't really ease her mind. 

I also always tell her she's pretty but I'm family so it doesn't really help.

This kid is already depressed and basically hates herself, and I have no idea what to do. I suggested a self care app, but she said it was boring. She also doesn't like meditating. She sees a therapist but he's kind of an asshole and she says it doesn't help her at all. But the services were actually required by law due to possible trauma (long story but she wasn't abused or anything like that) and my mom can't actually afford a new therapist for her so we're just waiting for the service to, uh, finish.

Speaking of not affording things, my family is pretty low income (single mom raising four children) and we wouldn't be able to afford most ""selfcare"" methods/ideas.

Even though she is mature for her age, I would say upper class high school mature, seriously, it's still kinda sad that she's going through this. She also has anxiety that all her friends secretly hate her and only contact her or hang out with her out of pity. She's shy so ""making better friends"" is hard as well. Not to mention she really enjoys her current friend's company despite how they make her feel. 

I hope I'm not coming off as dramatic, I'm just sad because I don't know what to do or say. I can't lie, I don't have a lot of confidence either sometimes (pretty on and off about that) so...I don't know how to comfort her. Any advice or things she could do for self care or whatever?",01Aug2019,1

72,"So I’m telling you guys. I’m happy as a mother frickin fuck can be. I didn’t win the lottery. I didn’t land a 6 figure job. I didn’t get married. I didn’t take MDMA. I’m just fucking happy because I am not living in the fear of what people think of me when I’m being myself.

For the past 2 years, I was living in depression and anxiety. I couldn’t fucking leave my room because I was scared to talk to my own family. I couldn’t go out to the store because I was afraid that I’d get an anxiety attack. There would be days where I was happy but then I’d go back to my depressive state because that was my home. I didn’t know that being happy consistently was a possibility. But it is and I owe it to a few things:

Therapy, meditation, boxing, friends, family, myself, and so much more.

In my depressive state, all those cliche sayings like “there’s nothing to fear but fear itself” or “people’s opinions of you is none of your business” didn’t resonate with me. They didn’t click and I thought it was all bullshit. It’s not bullshit but it takes experience to understand these things. They make sense logically, but you don’t truly feel the meaning of these sayings until you gain perspective. It also takes a lot of practice and training your mind to believe these sayings.

It feel like your brain is molasses. You're present, you still *think* at normal speeds, but the connection between your mind and your body is severed, only hanging on by a thread. 

You're thirsty. You need a drink. You haven't had water in 6-8 hours. You're in bed. You won't get up. Not *can't,* ***won't***. It's too hard. Your brain fires off desperate pleas for water, your brain **commands** you to fucking move. You don't respond. Not until the very last moment, until your entire body is so desperate for sweet, sweet hydration that it ignores you completely and your survival instincts kick into overdrive. You are no longer in control, much to your dismay. But then you get up... And it feels good! You walk around on your own free will to get yourself a drink. All the while your energy is constantly depleted, but you push that part of your psyche to the very back of your brain for a while out of sheer will to survive another day...much to your chagrin.

You plop back down onto your bed. It's comfy. So comfy. Nevermind that it's concrete, it's just so good to lay down again. You wish you could never get up. You get high. You get high from never doing anything. When you get up, and you do get tired after 5 minutes, you think to yourself ""Okay. Just one more tiny nap, and I'll be fine. Just one more snooze. Just one more hit, and I'm off it. Cold turkey.""

It never works.

It's reassuring yourself that you'll be fine without your meds for a 3rd day. It's the withdrawal you get on the 3rd and 4th days. You can't stand it, but it feels so fucking good. You're addicted to wallowing in your own sorrow. You feel the urge to carve up your face so no one will love you. You'll have too much baggage for anyone to handle. No one will love you anyway, you worthless fuck. Do it. Carve your face like a jack-o'-lantern. Cut your face, then smash your worthless pumpkin head into the broken mirror you used to carve it with.

That's where I am, right now.

It's not going through with any of that. It's taking your meds on the fourth day, or the third night. It's feeling better. It's starting that fucking cycle all over again.

75,"‪Unpopular opinion: if you know someone who is legitimately suicidal, do not intervene, let them commit suicide if they want, because depression and anxiety are terminal mental illnesses that will only continue to eat away at your will to live daily unless you indulge yourself in countless medication that will get rid of these thoughts only to be replaced with a blanket of nothing, desolate, a husk incapable of emotion which is what makes us human once you take that away we go along with it, and that’s worse than being suicidal let me tell you, there is no winning against depression only being able to hide it better and not let others worry about you. Suicide will put you out of the gene pool and prevent anymore people being born with this wretched mental illness.

76,"I'm a 19 Asian guy and going into sophomore year of college. Never had a true girlfriend and am still a virgin. So incel basically. I have a lot of negative feelings about myself and the world on pretty much a daily basis and was hoping to get some advice.

High school was probably the most miserable period of my life when it's usually it's one of the most fun and exciting for a lot of people. I moved schools from a high school in a different country after freshman year so I had no friends to begin with. On top of that, I was a fat nerdy Asian kid with little to no social skills so I wasn't starting off from a great point. I made no close friends in high school, never had a relationship, never went to parties, and was never invited anywhere by anybody. I couldn't even talk about this with my mom and dad since they lived overseas in Korea.

I did make some attempts at getting a girlfriend, but was rejected every time, although they were mostly nice about it. The only exception being the girl who said she didn't like small dicks. After this I started feeling a vague sort of resentment, where I recognized that I wasn't owed a relationship, but felt bitter about the fact that everyone else seemed to be so happy and in fulfilling relationships while I was left behind. After that I discovered incel stuff via google and started reading about it. That probably made my life even worse, as I started noticing unattractive things about myself that I had never really given much thought about before. The fact that my chin was slightly receded or that one side of my face was flatter than the other, and that as an asian I would be considered less attractive. I would go on reddit threads about tinder and other dating sites in an attempt to get proven wrong about these things, but everything I read on there seemed to match with what incels were saying so I bought fully into the self-loathing stuff. I got more and more depressed at reading tinder stories and thinking that even if I would be average I would have a hard time. Life would be complete hell for the next 3 years, with little exaggeration. The only time I even remotely felt better was just standing in a hot shower or going to sleep, and even then I would sometimes be crying over how ugly I was. What I'm experiencing now is nowhere near close to what I felt then.

Fast forward to after high school graduation, I decided to try and get into shape and make a better image for myself, since this was a chance to go to a place with a blank slate and a fresh start. I started working out and lost a lot of weight and even built up some muscle. Also I started dressing better and taking better care of my hygiene, and actually using soap when I showered. I started talking to people with similar interests and ended up joining an rpg club and a more personal dnd group with a group of friends. I came out of my shell and started being a lot more friendly, and when I told jokes, people actually thought they were funny and laughed. I felt good that I could make people laugh. I felt happy for the first time in a long while.

I still had no luck with dating though, pretty much because of my own internalized self-hatred. There was a cute girl in my dnd group who I thought had a interest in me, since she would keep glancing and staring over at me at random times and touching my arm and shoulder. I wanted to ask her out but I couldn't. I didn't want to potentially ruin the dynamic that we had, I was way too scared of rejection and I had a fear that she would be disgusted by me asking her out like that girl in high school was. I kept thinking that she wouldn't want to date someone who wasn't 6 feet(I'm 5'10) and that girls weren't interested in asian guys. So I didn't ask her or any other girl out and remained single. I really hated myself for being a fucking coward after that.

During this summer it got worse since I really didn't have any friends to hang out with since I went to Korea to visit my family. I started taking hot showers all the time again, just standing in the stall. Working out wasn't fun anymore, it just felt empty and hollow. I read incel stuff again and continued to be depressed over my appearance, and started to hate myself more and more. It sucks. I can't talk about this to anyone outside of the internet because of how unbelievably pathetic my problems sound. I can't even do it on my main reddit account, I'm writing this up on a throwaway.

TLDR: Getting into incel ideology has completely warped my worldview and made my life multiple times worse for several years. Would like advice on how to escape this pit.

Also if wanted I can send pictures of myself so people can judge me and give advice on what I can do physically. Not going to post public pictures of myself so I'm not recognized.",01Aug2019,4

Nothing much happened today. Continued watching The Office on my laptop and played some My friend Pedro for like an hour. So basically, I've been on my laptop for most of the day.... most of the week actually because I just can't figure out what else to do. The good news is I was able to workout and fight the urge to relapse. This time, the urge was really strong. I found myself attempting to search some nsfw stuff on my phone when I got really bored, but I reminded myself that I was gonna regret it if I did. It felt good to fight my addiction. It's as if I had full control over my life. I am hoping that I will find the willpower to continue this for good. Anyway, last night I posted on the freedom wall of my old school. It was something about comparing the college I was in to the high school I graduated from. It's been a year since I've been going over this actually and I just can't help myself. It seems like I always need to find a way to talk about it because I don't feel heard or maybe no one can relate. Maybe I still need to improve my perspective on things. This journal writing is really helpful by the way. It really allows me to reflect on why I do things and what i should be doing.  Maybe I should start meditating again to improve my focus on school.

86,"Today I (23/F) am leaving on a four day trip, leaving my girlfriend (28/F) alone for the first time since we met last September. It may not seem like a big deal to a lot of people, four days isn't much afterall, but it's a long time for her. She has been dealing with depression and anxiety most of her life and has been dealing with it through professionals and only recently through medication.

When her anxiety acts up and she starts to have an attack her mind drifts towards some of the most negative thoughts she can imagine, and this woman is a amateur writer so her imagination is quite good. Sometimes they are about me or her current situations, sometimes it's reliving the past, weight way she gets these negative emotions stuck in her head and it spirals her into a depressive episode. 

Three last few months I've watched her fight these with everything she has, she never stops fighting them and she always wins but it does take time. I'm always there for her during these times so when I say I'm leaving for four days that's a long time for her. Me even leaving is a reason for a negative scenario to pop into her head. 

This sounds like she's the only one that's going through a hard time but it's not just her. She has helped me through done of my own demons my own problems with alcohol and binge drinking. Ever since I met her I've gotten a lot better about it, I wanted to be better for her. Not because she needs me to be but because I want to be. 

With everything going on in her mind is hard to catch her when she's in a state of genuine happiness, where her smile isn't force and she's not wearing a mask that hides her true feelings. I've seen that smile more often lately and my heart melts every time.

I have been in a few relationships before I met her, and they only ever taught me that love was transactional, there was always a reason needed to do anything. Now, with her, it's just fluid. It's weird to think that is how I thought relationships were, just a series of transactions between each other. That's not love, that's not my definition of love anymore. Love is wanting to be closer to her, hugging her because you want her to feel warm, smiling at just how amazing she is, being held to make the negative thoughts go away, having someone that looks forward to waking up next to you just because you're there.

I'm leaving today before she's off work, I'll be back Tuesday before she's off work. These next four days are going to be difficult.",01Aug2019,5

I proved me worth at the internship and the boss offered me a job when i finish school.

OK, so perhaps not a very traditional question but I hope you can bear with me and offer some advice.

I am a relatively successful finance professional living in a big European City. Currently single and living with my sister in a shared flat. We get along great!

I have had an interest in kink since I can remember, particularly female domination / dominatrix stuff. I have played a lot with the idea of experiencing it for myself but having failed to find a non-paying play partner I set about contacting a professional domme.

I met with her and she is relatively nice, and we have agreed to play this Saturday - I have already booked the dungeon.

I am stressing out however about this being a defining moment in my life - Something I cannot back away from. Having a session with a domme (even if just one) would generate a ""skeleton in the closet"" that would need to come out in the future, at least with my future wife. And it could also potentially create ""dirt"" on me that someone could use against me (I am not that important but am in a relatively public / high paying industry).

I've been chewing the thoughts for a few days now. On the one hand it's almost as if I'm ""daring"" myself to experience something I have wanted to experience (at least in fantasy) for a long time. On the other, I am terrified of the risks above mentioned - And also of loving it and then being something I crave in the future. Like trying a drug for the first time.

At the same time, if I apologise for wasting her time and cancel the appointment I wil have to promise myself that I will never act on this again - Given I had the chance to act on it and voluntarily chose not to do it.

Any thought and opinions appreciated. So far I have looked within myself and have discovered that a) I would feel shame to spend money on this but b) at the same time I crave this experience. I guess either doing it or not would be liberating in its own way.

Thanks for reading!

TL;DR - Have hired a dominatrix after toying with the idea for years but now I'm freaking out about this being a skeleton in the closet for the rest of my life that will affect my relationships forever.",01Aug2019,1

The only thing stopping me right now is the fact that in my state 16 year olds can't get a license unless they finish a driving academy. I'm almost finished with it, and have everything else I need booked. As long as I pass the road test, I'll be able to stay with my friends and in a much safer environment! Wish me luck on that!

Then I started stripping.

I always had an interest in sex work but I grew up in a poor area with no opportunity. When I moved to Dallas at 22 I really started dabbling. It’s like I was seeking out sex work. My job was very stressful and very low paying (18.50 after promotion). I started cocktail waitressing, then camming, then I did at home porn with my boyfriend, then I met a ho and her pimp and learned the trade from her knowing I could disappear since my lease was almost up at my apartment. Once I saw the money I quit my job. My career. Everything I thought would make me happy since I was 13. All I had worked towards... and i went and got hired as an entertainer at a club. 

A year and a half later I have zero regrets. I am very satisfied. Finally. My whole life I thought I had to work through my youth and try for grad school then work through grad school and work even harder after. But working towards those goals didn’t make me happy. Being my own boss makes me happy. I can go to grad school at any point later in life. I can get hired back into my field easily and just say I was a stay at home step mom for some years... I have zero desire to adhere to a “normal” job. 

I feel like everything society tells you that you need to do is a lie. I genuinely thought that I was successful in life even though I was miserably stressed and my life revolved around work. I don’t make my family proud anymore. I don’t really care. I sincerely do not know how my life is going to play out. I may go teach English abroad.  Now all I do is travel the US and dance.

okay, that's fine. he said he liked the sex and had fun. but when i bring it up he has little to nothing to say and shows literally zero enthusiasm. i thought i might be misreading him but he speaks about our mushrooms constantly, he's still animated about his interests, and he's just as talkative as ever.

i feel like I'm going crazy. i feel like I'm the only one having an adventure and letting loose and getting excited. he's more excited to talk about his theoretical next d&amp;d character than when i try to talk to him about what he liked about our third partner.

It started about 5 years ago when I met him. I had just gotten out of a relationship and I was just curious for the dating apps out there. I was never really looking for anything as far as a relationship, just to see how these apps work. From plenty of fish to hot or not, I had one of everything. Everything just for research until I stumbled his photo. Just him in a blue stripped shirt with him wearing headphones and smiling next to a speaker. I don't what it was but I was just drawn to him and so I swiped right and we were a match. I was surprised that he even swiped right on me too and even right now I can't remember who messaged who first, but I'm glad we did.

It was months of texting into the late night until after two cancelations I made the initiative of making a date to go out and seeing the new godzilla movie. We hit it off and we connected instantly and sharing out like of thing like HIMYM ( How I Met Your Mother, great show and would recommend to anyone). I took a risk like he took a risk in just seeking a kiss on my cheek. One thing led to another and we finally official.

Life was good. It was great. It was just perfect. Though there were thing that we could agree could be better. Like the distance. I was from the San Bernardino County and he was from the LA county. The distance was there, he didn't like it but I didn't mind it. I was from very sheltered Mexican house hold so for obvious reasons my pwdidnt like the fact I would go to him, when it was the man job to come to me. There are just some old traditions that I now see, more importantly, he wanted me see that there are just traditions that are just out of date and that's okay. Although to my parents, this was wrong and they still had there traditions engraved in me. Not all was engraved but there were times when I should have been on his side... There were many times when I should have been on his side.

I believe I was doing everything right. I thought I was being the best girlfriend I could ever been. I was never the jealous type, I gave 100% trust in him because I didn't then what would be the point in being together. When he asked for help I gave as much help as I could possibly give. When he got into his motorcycle accident, I came every day and stayed till visiting hours were over when I was able to, but he still felt lonely or from what I knew now and not back then. I thought I was doing everything right. When we had our first big fight, it was because I didn't prioritize him. It didn't make sense to me at the time because I wasn't his wife or fiance. I was just his girlfriend. To prioritize thing in one's life, I was taught that it was family, work, friends and then yourself and I believe it. When I told him this he was of course saddened but I didn't think of him as a priority when I didn't know he had at the the top of the list. It shocked me. I had never been at the top of someone's list like that. I should have seen it sooner how much he was giving/ putting into us.

Our first anniversary came and it was like a dream and when we had our second it was like I was in heaven. I'm still baffled at the fact that someone tolerated me that long (in a joking way of course). I couldn't have been more happoer with him and I thought I was making him happy too. He would take me to new places, encouraged me to try thing that I would have never done. He pushed me to be my own person. There were thing that I didn't see, well what I didn't wanna see...

After our second anniversary, early morning on labor day  like at 2 am early, we were together in bed sleeping. Which in context is a big thing for us since my old school parents didn't think it was right for a man to be in a lady's room. Plus they were gone for the weekend along with my sisters and we had the whole house to ourselves. Where we were, it was just pure bliss. I was happy and I had a guy who loved me. I never had a password on my phone and to be frank I never needed one because I had nothing to hide. I texted in front of him and showed him what I was texting because I would forget how to spell words. I was open nothing to hide, he had a password on his but I honestly didn't care because he did have alot of his life on his phone like the bank, school, and other stuff, but something in me just wanted to look in his phone. When I did, I think something snapped inside of me. He was talk to other girls. Photos were exchanged, words were said, just everything was wrong. I confronted him and he said that it was because of my parents. Which even now is an excuse don't accept.

The thing about it when I found out, I didn't break up with him. I couldn't for the simple fact of me not wanting him the satisfaction of him getwoff the hook that easy. I just kept asking and asking what I did wrong. *side note we were kinda cross faded, he was worse though. We've never smoked before let alone edibles *. I kept asking him over and over again thinking that it was my fault, when I know when I told my friends about it, of course they told that it wasn't my fault, but I still didn't believe it.

Things just fell apart. Of course on the outside, but I falling apart even faster and I didn't even realize how fast I was falling. There were trials and tribulations and they hit hard and and him, the both of us really, but I still kept going because he made into something I never thought I'd be. A fighter. There were already so many thing that had happen to me in life, things that I can't even repeat, but we got through it. Made it through thick and thin, but I will not deny had still had a stain over my heart that just couldn't be washed because I guess I wanted that reminded. I wanted it there so I could never forget it so it wouldn't happen to me again and I guessed he noticed. He noticed and tried to do something about it, but it was never enough. In doing that, he also started to fade away to.

Just this passed weekend is when he ended it. It hit me, it hit me hard because I had never seen him this way before. I scared me and it angered me so much. I think it angered me so much that I think the thought of him quitting was something he swore he'd never do with us and I took it to heart. He told me that he was sorry he couldn't be better and that he was sorry for the burden he had cost me during these past 3 years. Yeah, 3 years, you read right. I mean why would anyone would stay after being shunned by their friends for staying with him, losing my best friend in the process, not speaking to my friends for a while year, almost losing my relationship with my mom and dad. I mean the logic isn't there, but didn't care because he was worth it. Yeah those 3 years were hard but I fought and worked hard to build those bridges, regain my best friend back and now I have a better relationship with my father, even after I had to have an abortion. Being from a Mexican catholic house hold, I committed the ultimate sin in there eyes and it broke me. I had no regrets because it was time for me, for us to have this beautiful thing to come into this world. Not where me and him were financially and realistically. Every thing was like one hit after another but just like his favorite superhero Spiderman, no matter how many time I got knocked down I got back up.

He said he needs time to remember who he his, because he even told me that he's not the same man I use to love. I know he thinks that it's the logical thing to do and that it's the best. I don't accept that, I won't accept that. In that moment he wasn't the man I loved but I slapped that thought out of my head because I've said the same thing over and over to myself. He's still the same man. I just didn't reach out to him and that's my sin.... I am still the same me through out every thing I am the still the same old me. I've just had stuff in my life that happened and I had learned how to manage, process and if needed eliminate people who weren't right, and there was one person who I had drop from my life and I thought of her as a sister too.

The thought of him asking to do this alone scares me. We haven't talked to each other or seen each other since. I keep hearing those words, I need to do this on my own. You don't need to be alone because i shouldn't have made him felt but I don't want him to ever feel that, but I did and I need to fix what I had done. I haven't give up on us, on him on myself. When I almost did..... I was standing on the edge of a hill crying, I was about to quit all together, but I didn't and thanks to that one person who he thinks his controlled by his emotions, metaphorically speaking of course, slapped sense into me that I think he has been trying to tell me but my anger and fear inside of me would let him through.

I want to see him and talk to him and tell him that I won't give up on us and that he doesn't have hold the weight anymore, but I don't know how much time should I give him with out making it to suffocating.

This took me on/off two days to write because of work and my need to not be in the house... Ahh this was mentally and emotionally strenuous to write and I kind hope that he would see this online cuz I know he will be online and just read words.",01Aug2019,2
130,"I'm 28. Divorced. Single father with custody. No help financially from my daughters mom. We live with my dad. I just went to my hearing for my bankruptcy. I gave everything up financially in the divorce to make sure I had my daughter. The woman I had been seeing that I was really into decided she wasn't as into me as I was into her. Car needs a new windshield so I can stop being pulled over for an expired inspection and a new tire. I'd been running on a spare for 3 months. Job has been doing layoffs and I'm scared to lose it. Have to sell my bike to help pay the bankruptcy.

Today just to top it off my graphics card on my computer went out after 5 years. I used that computer for everything. Entertainment. Music. My daughter and I use it to watch movies. So now when she gets home in a bit I have to tell her its broken.

I just feel like I have nothing to offer. I'm stuck. I put on a smile for my daughter. Thankfully she's young but she started asking me if I was okay lately. She is starting to be able to tell something isn't right. 

I have no idea why I'm writing this. Maybe it's cathartic to be able to put this out there. Best of luck to all of you who feel stuck too.",01Aug2019,287

Even one I deem funny and interesting...

Even in my established relationships I feel that everyone just tolerates me and makes fun of me behind my back. I don’t take criticism well either. Rejection hurts because of what hopes I did have and because what I imagine about myself feels true. I don’t allow myself to have crushes. I never think I got the job after interviews.

Cocaine can jack up your life, and do physical damage. It’s really bothering me because I have some friends, who act like “every once in awhile” it’s okay to do coke, it’s not it can severely fuck up your life but none of them listen to me, they act like it’s casual like marijuana. Is anyone else noticing this?",01Aug2019,3
137,"I don't really expect anyone to read this, but I really just want to take this off my chest.

Today was the first day of the school year or me. I was both looking forward to and dreading meeting up with an ex-friend. The friendship meant a lot to me and it ended off pretty sour. They decided that I was not a good friend and to end the friendship. After a little while of me trying to get them to alter their mind about their decision. I decided to let the friendship go too, if that was what they really wanted. 

That was 1 and a half months ago, and today I expected to see them. I didn't know if they had changed their mind about me or not. I didn't know how they felt at all. Me and them had stopped all communication. I wrote them a letter. It was heartfelt and had secrets in invisible ink. It was mainly to just tell them how sorry I was and how I regretted of how I acted in the past. The friendship meant a lot to me. I couldn't just let it go. I really did want to repent for my sins and make it up to them.

So, we were supposed to have the same first (and only) class of the day together. I expected to see them, to hand over the letter, and to let them read it on their own time. I also wanted to see how they felt about me now that so much time has elapsed. However, they didn't show up that day. At first I thought they were just late, it was something that they were known for doing. However, later, a mutual friend told me how they were now at a different school. How I could no longer see them...

I was pretty broken. I had the letter with me and had nothing to do with it. I didn't really know how to feel, I was just so... unexpectedly disappointed and sad about it all. I could no longer see them ever again. That hit HARD. We were so close before, me and them. We used to talk all the time after classes, text for hours, and had so much fun together. Me and them were close. Not best-friends, but still, up there.

I'm pretty heartbroken about the whole situation. They didn't even bother to inform me that they had moved. They didn't care anymore... but I still really do care. It was my fault for thinking we were closer than we really were all that time ago, and my own issue that I've held on to this hope for so long and looked forward to something that doesn't exist. It was my fault that the friendship broke down to begin with anyways...

I do want to text them something, but not now. It's just the beginning of a new school year and they must be going through their own headaches and struggles. I really just want to just talk to them, that's what I planned to do in person. But, if they couldn't bother telling me of how they were no longer attending the same school, they probably have no interest in talking to me. It honestly hurts me more than anything else, but I can't do anything now...

Thanks for reading this far. I don't think I really need any advice nor do I really want any. I just need to take the hit and move on, there's a future out there and I can't keep lingering in the past. I might delete this later, who knows. Thanks.",01Aug2019,1
138,"So When i gossiping with my best friends we start talking about stupid things we do in the past so we start search for photos,online post,text message that we put on media social. When i start to look for my middle school life it shakes me because it so miserable and then i realize why its so hard to remember it. When im in middle school i literally got no friends LOL i basically the enemy of the entire class, they often not invited me to play together or basically planing something behind my back they always left me out because i dislike soccer or sports in general and i was kinda nosy and have a foul mouth, well i did try to liking soccer so i can befriend them but its just make me their laughing stock because i only know little thing about it. Thankfully i got friends from various places so i can forget about all the shitty things that happen and yes that friends from another class is my best friends until now. I just cant thank them enough to lighten the darkness in my life.

142,"Currently I’m wrapped in a silk blanket in my bare mattress staring at this room while thinking “so, this is my life now..” 

A few months ago I really wanted to enlist in the marine corps. I loved the US so. I shipped off to boot camp and I was horrified by what I saw. You see all those fraternity movies and hazing and you think “that’s so fake” but the one thing you’d never think is that the government would ever be involved in that. Nope. Boot camp is 3 months of straight up hazing. Then after MCT came MOS school and I started to get those freedoms again. But I always knew it would never be the same, we’d have PT early then there’s formations and rules about what you can’t do when you’re not on the job etc. I graduated MOS school and I was told I’d be going to an infantry unit. I thought, “oh god, life just can’t get any worse can it?” 

I got here and it’s so chill. There’s no PT and so many of the clothing rules we couldn’t wear while in civilian clothes are ignored here because we in Hawaii. 

Currently I’m waiting for my mentor I guess you could call him, to return from doing something. Been here since 10 I believe?

143,"So, alot of changes in my life have led to me seriously questioning some previously held notions I had about myself, and I'm coming to realize how wrong I was. I'm always a little wordy and rambling, it's kinda my thing, but I'm gonna go out of order.

For years, I held that I was an introvert. Hell, I liked staying in and reading my books and what have you, pursuing my academic interests. That isn't to say I didn't have friends, but hanging out was just a small part of life. 

Starting in around 7th grade, I turned inward to focus on my academic interests and almost entirely neglected my social life save for two friends. It wouldn't be until I was about 16 that I started actually hanging out with people in person again. Funny thing that by 17 I had one of my best friends and a network of people I loved hanging out with and cared deeply about. 

The thing here is that while I was bookish as a kid, I was ALWAYS out playing with my friends, I always made friends in daycare and with the neighbors. I had some great friends in early middle school. Yet, in the formative years when most kids have their first loves, they first real friendships, learn the social etiquette of the real world, I turned inward. That's alot of lost time in the formative years!

For reference, I'm now 19, having completed a decent year at university. I joined a fraternity out there, made friends, etc. But I still held myself as an introvert. After all, I was perfectly comfortable sitting inside playing video games or reading sometimes, completely alone. But there was always something nagging at me with these experiences, something not quite like the joy I otherwise felt...

As an additional aside, I did have one brief flame in high school, but never really put much effort into dating. Besides, I lacked confidence as I was rather heavy set until about age 16 when I worked back to a normal weight and focused on my appearance. This summer, while at home for an internship, I decided to make another foray into the dating world. Something I had first approached with apprehension was now one of the most exciting parts of my life. Physics be damned, dating is fun! After 2.5 months of validation, casual sex, and a little heartbreak, I started to realize that a.) I'm too emotional for casual sex and dating and b.) That I was really enjoying myself.

When I wasn't dating or hanging out with my friends this summer, I felt low almost like an addict off of their opiates. Then today while I was doing mundane data entry at work it struck me like one of those fancy French bullet trains -- the happiest moments I can pinpoint for the past 3 years were with other people. Looking back, a trend became apparent: 

    - after Prom 2016 and all of my Senior friends leaving, profoundly sad

    - thought I would get sick of friends during Sr. Week, instead had a blast and sad for 3 weeks after returning

   - i absolutely loved and looked forward to hanging out with my fraternity brothers in college

  - hey, parties are kinda fun!

 - ^ same thing, but also alcohol

- really sad returning from trip to chicago with friends

- really enjoyed dating

Then I realized, that nagging hollow feeling I've had for a while now is due to the lack of socializing and my need for it. I had become so content and comfortable on my own, self isolating from a fear of failure (and admittedly lack of interest) that I had developed a sense of pseudo-introversion. The reality is, I don't have classic introvert traits. I'm not as happy home alone as I am with friends, not even close. I don't even get burnt out by my friends, I've just used that as an excuse. 

This is like my Eureka moment! For a lack of better words, maybe the Buddhists are into something -- self-introspection is some wacky shit.",01Aug2019,1

I need a plan for this plan, so I have to go to coffee shops (there a few really close to my place), and bookstores/library... that's all I have.

It’s been really tough for the past year. I’m a minor that had an abortion 6 months ago and I’ve just been all over the place. I’ve started meeting up with a therapist for my depression, grief, and panic attacks(?) and it has helped, but my low self esteem is putting so many limitations on myself and my relationship with my bf. 

I’ve stopped meeting up with my friends and now I spend most of my day by myself studying or watching videos. I’ve forced myself to get a job so I can go out at least twice a week, but I don’t really talk to anyone there. I also compare myself to everyone I know, to the point where I’ll be crying nonstop over some trivial reason. Unlike me, my boyfriend is working at a huge government institution, which may lead him to his dream job, and is eternally positive no matter what happens. My parents keep telling me to have confidence in myself, but it’s not something that I can magically whip out of my nowhere.

Whenever I receive any form of criticism or things don’t go according to plan, I let it  ruin my day and I often take it out on my bf. Even though he’s very optimistic and encouraging, I know our relationship has become extremely toxic and he’s just about reached his turning point. I’ve been trying to break up with him for a while because I feel so guilty about all the things I say to him and all the added mess I’ve dragged him into, but I couldn’t do it until today.

153,"A little background: I grew up in a household where my mother pretty much raised me. My dad lived oversees and I talk to him sometime once a month or once a week sometimes. He primarily financially supported me and my mom. When it came to an actual relationship, it was pretty much just about school and work. I feel that he doesn’t know a lot about my personal life. My parents are still married but have never really functioned as a married couple. My dad has been verbally and physically abusive to my mom growing up. They haven’t spoken in 3 years. And none of my siblings talk to my dad except me. It was traumatizing growing up in the middle of all the chaos and being torn between supporting my mom and still trying to have a relationship with my dad even though he’s verbally abusive to the rest of my family (and has been to me in the past but I’ve decided to leave that in the past)

Anyways, I’ve always been told that fearing being forever alone is normal, but I actually expect this to happen for me. For some reason, I have a hard time emotionally connecting to any guys I meet. No matter how hard I try to like someone it just doesn’t happen. I’m only 21 years old, but still, I go through life and all my friends have went through multiple romantic relationship. I don’t understand how they can easily make connections or find people they click with. And even that, they find numerous! I can barely find one. I recently found a guy that pretty much checks off everything I’ve ever wanted. I went on a few dates with him and ended up breaking it off for no reason, other thank I simply just did not want to be involved with him. I could not pinpoint why though. 

I fear that growing up in the household I grew up in has instilled some sort of trait in me where I cannot create a connection with a guy because I never really saw that in my parents? Not sure if that makes sense. Also not sure what I’m going to accomplish with this post but it’s something I think about everyday. Thoughts?",01Aug2019,1
154,"I began avoiding my family completely at 13. My parents were fighting all the time and I would stay in my room to avoid being yelled at or caught in the middle. I knew how to fly under the radar and only every once in a while would I get comments about leaving my room. I kept this up throughout the divorce proceedings up until I was 17. All during this I would tell them not to attend my sports events or theater productions. I never let my long time friends or relationships get close to my family.

I was forgotten about as a child. I was always the one they left alone and never asked about because they assumed I would always be fine. I succeeded in making myself an outcast in order to protect myself.

I opened up after the divorce finished up and I cut contact with my mother. My fathers anger issues subsided and I got a new step mother. Things were alright even though the step mother always wanted to change how my sisters and I interacted to be like her kids. We were always the ones with issues while her kids were always perfect.

It kind came to a head when my sister and I had a fight today. It was over a lamp and while we were getting angry it was nothing huge. She put herself in between and started calling us assholes and bitches. She was just screaming insults at us and it shocked me. When she told my dad about the fight he said he should just smash the lamp. 

I realized in that moment that I didn’t escape my dysfunctional family, I just have a different one now. I have a father and step mother who cannot say a sentence without criticizing us. We will never be good enough and we never receive praise. I’m done with this.
