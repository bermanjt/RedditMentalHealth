So the tongue naturally has tiny bumps on it but recently near the tip of my tongue one has become painful and white. Its so small it‚Äôs hard to distinguish in the mirror but it is painful and white. It‚Äôs not a lie bump, a canker sore, or a sore related to any sort of sti. If anyone has any ideas that would be appreciated. I naturally worry so my mind went straight to a tumor which I know is irrational but I would like ideas.",18Oct2019,1

3,"Throwaway because my family will put me in counseling if they saw this.  

I‚Äôm 20, about to turn 21 on Saturday and I have a cloudy view about the rest of my life.  I attend a community college and recently changed my major to welding from animal sciences.  Big change, I know, but it seems like no matter what I do, I just feel myself getting deeper and deeper in a hole.  

I am almost 21 and still barely have a year of college under my belt.  My parents pay for it luckily but I feel as a let down and I have wasted a lot of their money.  And it feels terrible and it makes me regret the past 3 years of my life.  I want to be successful but at this current state in my life, I just want to die.  

I don‚Äôt have many ways of copping with what I‚Äôm dealing with.  I play video games more than I should and I realize that but it seems like the only thing that really makes me focus and honestly makes me kind of happy.  Sitting in my room and playing till 3 in the morning chatting with my friends.   It has become a problem, but I am doing nothing about it, which I see as an issue.  

I have a pretty great girlfriend.  We‚Äôve been together for a little bit over a year.  She stays on top of me which is what I need.  She wants the best for me and I can see myself spending the rest of my life with her.  But sometimes I feel like I want to be single.  Sitting in my room and thinking about life without a girlfriend, but I would probably descend further down a hole without her.  

I want to be an automotive fabricator and hopefully open up my own shop.  I‚Äôm really big into European cars, specifically BMW and Porsche, but I like anything really, just not the new cookie cutter cars.  Cars is another thing that brings me joy and I really enjoy working on them, but I make $200 a week, so I can‚Äôt really afford to do anything except change the fluids every now and then.  

I am not expecting a reply from anyone, this is just me speaking because I don‚Äôt do it a lot in real life and I don‚Äôt necessarily like to show my feelings.  Very macho, I know.  But in reality, I‚Äôm a scared 20 y/or who doesn‚Äôt know my purpose.  At this moment I am just living to die.  

Sorry if the format is crappy, I‚Äôm on mobile typing this on the toilet.  

Maybe online encouragement is what I need, if you feel the need to reach out to me or you have something going on in your life you‚Äôd like to talk about I am glad to talk about it.  I am not a professional by any means but I would like to give it my best shot.  

Thank you for reading this far. I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs all over the place, I am not a good story teller and pay someone to right my essays for school so there‚Äôs that.  

Thank you",18Oct2019,2

5,"(the taco bell website wouldn't allow me post this because the address field was buggy and unresponsive, so I'm posting here, not a hail corporate or anything I just want to know if this resonates with anyone, if it does I will try to email to them again, this time with the actual location bc I love Taco bell and I'm not trying to make that particular location look bad.) 


I just came back from picking up my $15 online order at the Taco Bell in America and I would really like to share some complimentary and critical ideas:


Good: Taco Bell America has great friendly staff, great lighting and the prices are fair.¬†

Needs improvement: This Taco Bell is far, far too small and understaffed for this exceptionally popular location, are you aware of the seemingly constant bumper to bumper, 'out into the street' drive thru line? Please compel the Franchise owner to purchase adjacent property and expand parking lot, create additional drive through lane and especially hire more staff.

Finally, my order was cold and incomplete. The Staff forgot to put any hot sauces or napkins in my order bag, they didn't even ask me if I wanted any! Also, two of my burritos were not constructed right and promptly fell apart. I don't blame the Taco Bell America Staff for these irritating mistakes, I blame the lack of hiring additional staff, limited space and resources, they are currently setup to fail at the this time imho. Please help the Franchise Owner significantly expand this location in order to meet the exceptionally high demand in this area, preferably triple the customer capacity and consider a new designation for such expanded stores, perhaps call them ""Taco Bell Deluxe(s)"". Thank you for reading this, good luck!¬†

6,"Don't know where to post this but I like this sub and it seems like a safe place. I'm 32m, married, 2 kids, good job, but I feel totally, utterly, socially inept. I have no confidence in myself around people in public. Sometimes it does pop up, and sometimes I have to force it. sometimes I just find the strength to get through the day and I don't even think about it. I love my wife, but the fire is fading. I feel like I put a lot of pressure on my sex life to the point where I measure my self worth based off of the quantity and quality of it. As such, when I'm traveling for work, I sometimes fantasize about having an affair or calling an escort, but I'm too scared to ever even attempt to do it. And though the temptation is there, I think apart of me knows I would just feel terrible afterwards. Which makes me feel like more of a coward for not having the balls to do it and just not give a fuck. I get stressed easily in public. Although I'm usually like a duck on water. I seldom find myself cutting loose or relaxing. I compare myself to others constantly, and it's always how I'm not as good or funny or friendly as them. I feel like a constant outsider. When I do try to cut loose a little, it feels forced, awkward, and I seem to make a fool out of myself. I have a ton of acquaintances but no close friends. The thing is, I'm doing ok in life. Not bad, not great, but good. But yet I seem to find myself surrounded by people more social, more intelligent, more funny, more charming, more confident than me. Today was hard, but I got through it. Tomorrow will be better. 

Posting from mobile so I apologise for the errors. Thanks for reading.",18Oct2019,3

8,"Last week, i made a choice. I was following channel like Alexander Grace, Entrepreneurs in car and other Red Pill Channel video. They mainly talk about woman Hypergammy. Watching those video over and over bring me to a point of hate. They may claim its for educational purpose only, but honestly, i now belive that those channel are more about expressing the hate they have towards woman. In the end, that hate start growing in me. I'm single for a long time and always felt as failure in life for that. Those video was just finding a reason to put the blame over woman for me to be single. And to be honest, i hated that feeling. I end up carying that hate. It didnt serve me anything positive. Didnt bring me any happyness. Why in the world should i keep listen to someone who just keep making me feel more crap. I remember Wayne Dyer say :"" If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at changes."" wich is exactly what i want to do. If i keep looking at a bad side, i can only see that side. Hypergammy might be real, but kindness, respect and real love might aswell. Anyway, time to leave what doesnt serve me any good behind, and move fowards.",18Oct2019,43
10,"Okay, so Idk where else to post stuff like this and I‚Äôm not one to talk to people close to me about this stuff for various reasons. Like I started my first semester of college in August and it‚Äôs been fun and stressful. Before I came here my grandfather(80) on my moms side was diagnosed with blood cancer and he‚Äôs not seeking treatment. On top of that he began to show signs of dementia in March-ish and some days when I talk to him it feels like he doesn‚Äôt even know who I am at first. If he passes my grandmother will likely have to go to a home since she‚Äôs fallen 4 times in the past year and she‚Äôs barley capable of walking most days. Last week family from Florida was supposed to come up.( I live in Pennsylvania) Well only my cousins came up because my uncle 2 days before they got on the plane collapsed because his liver is failing. He‚Äôs an alcoholic and basically stopped eating a few weeks ago and my mom is sure he was taking meds and overworked his liver. Now he‚Äôs fighting for his life. It sucks so much he was always one of my biggest supporters, he would find a way to watch me play HS football or track and cheer me on through texts. He‚Äôs an outstanding guy who served and just influenced me to study harder and work harder for my dreams. I hate that this is all happening now and I just feel like complete shit.

14,"I am writing this to tell the story of my mind, my thoughts, my past, my present, and my future. I was born in Portland, Oregon in 1993 to an American mother with origins in Oklahoma and a Brazilian father who at the time was illegally present in the US. I grew up in a then considered middle class home in inner southeast Portland home with my father working a decently paying job managing IT infrastructure at BlueCross BlueShield, a local health insurance provider. For what seemed like the Garden of Eden of childhood, I traveled yearly with my parents to visit our relatives in Florida, went on the classic American family vacation to Disney World, and shopped at Costco on the weekends. This childhood of mine -- what I deem the Garden of Eden period of my life ‚Äî persisted until the death of my brother Christopher when I was 8 years old. Christopher drowned because my father had prematurely filled the three-foot-deep backyard pool without installing guardrails as my mother pleaded him to do per my mother‚Äôs recounting of the series of events. My brother‚Äôs drowning -- damaging as it was that comes with the inherent tragedy of the death of a toddler ‚Äî amplified the character flaws in every member of my family for years to come. My father grieved in the most silent ways that was so typical of his introverted self; he self-destructed under the sense of guilt that he had filled the pool. Rather than lash out per the classic image of a middle aged American male struggling with the turmoil of life, my father directed his ire inward. He drank constantly but never was drunk; he smoked like a chimney but never coughed. He kept his steely composure and subtle joy to him up until the very end. My mother on the other hand channeled her grief outward; yelling at my father for his affairs (I never believed that was the real reason for these outbursts), throwing glasses when anger overcame her as a split second reaction to the compounding frustration of life, and smacking me across the face when I stepped out of line. In many ways, I look back and see which of the two was fundamentally healthier; my mother purged herself of that fateful, rainy spring day in 2002 over the next decade, my father committed slow-motion suicide. Carrying the emotional genes of two of them, I recognize the instinct for both (albeit less in degree) in myself as I navigate life at 26. 

The reader must be asking why do I put these events to digital paper? I suppose it‚Äôs to fall into the human trap of narrative fallacy and try to make order in a universe where entropy and chaos reign. Ultimately I want to engage in the cathartic act of self-expression by telling of the sorrow of wet and overcast days growing up in the Pacific Northwest while also showing the arc of my hopes to emerge from it 17 years hence. The story I plan to tell will at times detour into fantasy of imagined placed existing where they do not, and will hold only a broad notion of chronological order as its underlying structure, frequently referencing the past and the future.",18Oct2019,2

17,"So I had a pretty uninteresting childhood, me and my brother (2 years younger than me) and my parents all had a pretty good relationship.

I didn't know this when I was younger obviously but my dad struggled with depression all his life and it started to get really bad when I was around 10 years old. 

He worked as a special needs instructor in a homing facility for people with special needs and wanted to start introducing dogs into his work with the clients, his bosses didn't like this idea but he kept pushing it and was suspended from work over it.

It was while he was out of work that he started to become very sick and it was the first time I noticed something was wrong with him. He became a completely different person. The once loving, funny, loud and charismatic dad I had had become very distant, he lost his personality and stayed in bed all day everyday, we never saw him.

This was extremely stressful on my mother as she seen that me and my brother were very distraught about it and didn't know what was happening. I remember asking my Dad what was wrong with him around this time and he said he had an illness  that stopped him from being happy which visibly upset and confused me.

My parents began to fight a lot in front of us and I remember being terrified that they were going to separate. Every time they argued I begged them to stop but was told to go to my room, there was never any serious physical fights thankfully.

Eventually my fears came true and my dad moved out of our home to live in his sisters holiday home that she rented out. One day when we came home from school we walked into the kitchen to find broken plates, cups, and photos. We thought the house had been robbed. I went in to my Dads old room to find his bed and mattress completely soaked in blood. This would be his first suicide attempt.

I remember talking to my dad soon after this happened and he told me that he had cut his wrists with a boxcutter. He told me he wanted to die, and kept repeating this. I was around 11 at this time and could see that my dad was starting to go insane. I remember breaking down in tears as I hugged him and told him I didn't want him to die.

He came back to live with us after this. He was becoming more and more distant every day, we would go into his room to hug him goodnight every day and I remember the smell of his room becoming worse and worse every time we went in as he didn't leave his bed at all.

One day we came home from school and he wasnt there. The day came to night and he still hadn't came home. My mother told us not to worry but I knew something was wrong. That night I remember crying myself to sleep for the first time. 

The next day my mother confessed and told us that he was missing. My whole family were out looking for his car all night. They eventually found him unconscious in his car after overdosing on medication. This was his second suicide attempt.

He was brought to the hospital and recovered and was later sent to a mental health institution where he spent a couple months. It was a really nice place and when we visited him he seemed happy and had made friends there. I remember him telling me a story about him and his friend stealing a TV remote and sneaking outside to point it through the window of some of the patients rooms to change the channels which is kind of bad but I thought it was pretty funny at the time.

Eventually he finished up in the clinic and went back to live in his sisters holiday home again. He seemed to be happy. We would visit him and he would be active with us. He had taken up some hobbys and he seemed to be returning to his old self again. 

A couple of months later I was 12 and was a few weeks into starting secondary school when we were coming home and my mother got a phone call. She told us that we were going to our friends house for the evening. She told us she needed to go to a meeting and that she would see us later. Both me and my brother had a feeling that something was wrong but tried to ignore it.

Eventually that evening my aunt picked us up and told us that my mother was still busy but would be home soon. I knew something had happened. When we got home there were a few of our family members cars outside. My fathers car was also there, parked in front of the garage. We walked into the living room where they were all sitting. Everyone was looking at the floor except my mother who asked us to sit down and told us that our father had been found dead.

I remember my brother started crying but I couldn't react, I dont know why, I didn't say a word and just stared at the wall completely numb. I had known that he died and my mother just confirmed it but I didn't know how to react. I couldn't cry or feel anything, it felt like a joke.

My father had come home to end his life that day, he hung himself in the garage and was found by a neighbour. Third times the charm ay? 

I remember talking to my Dad about his depression once and he told me he wouldnt wish it on his worst enemy. Which is ironic in a way because myself my mother and my brother have all been struggling with our mental health after his death.

I miss him a lot and I always wonder what life would be like if he never had any mental health problems but I find that because of all the trauma I dont remember a lot about him, I dont really remember a lot about my childhood at all. It's like my brain has just deleted all that information.

I'm turning 21 next month and the years after his death had a terrible affect on me. I dropped out of school at 15 and developed a pretty bad drug problem, and basically turned into an extremely shitty person. It was only last year I decided to try and turn my life around which has been very hard. I now struggle with pretty bad anxiety which stops me from leaving my house, and depression which stops me from even leaving my bed most days. I feel like my mother is watching what happened to her husband be passed on to her son and I feel like I'm hurting her. I feel extremely ashamed of being like this but I know that I can pull through.

I‚Äôve had spirals of depression, friends pass away, family issues, etc. I‚Äôm not sure when it started exactly, but I know I was never like this before, and I‚Äôm now deeply rooted in escapist behavior. It‚Äôs honestly the root of a lot of current problems in my life. I find myself putting my alarm on snooze so much because it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt even want to get up. I‚Äôll prolong exercise even though I want to get back into it. And when I do manage to get to the gym I‚Äôll tell myself I‚Äôll do something like leg day but then skip it because I felt like I worked out enough. It‚Äôs tough because I feel like this behavior is killing my passion and it has definitely gotten rid of my drive. Does anyone have any advice? I‚Äôve already tried asking family to help but it didn‚Äôt work. It seems like the best thing to do is just rip off the bandaid and get to whatever I need to do. And when I do do that it works and I can for the most part stay on track. My issue is actually finding the willpower now to rip the bandaid off.

41,"Hi
(TLDR at the bottom)

So as the title says, I'm in need of some insurance to cover the cost of private mental health care, but no providers that I can see will cover you if your condition is already there!!

Just for some background, I've tried going through the NHS (very unsuccessfully).  Over the past 10 years I've been passed through about 20 different services, and been given different diagnoses most times. I've been told I have anxiety, social anxiety, separation anxiety, SAD, severe depression,bipolar, bpd and ptsd. No one can agree on one thing, and as such I get passed out of each service very quickly to be put onto long waiting lists.
I have also tried various anti depressants, none of which have had any effect on my mood and have not had any positive effect on me.
I have been at times very close to killing myself, but have been told I'm not at risk enough to help. 
Most recently I got told I don't be eligible for therapy because I'm not high-risk enough, but I know that I cannot cope without some intervention. I need help and I know I won't get it through the NHS now.

However, private mental health care usually equates to ¬£300+ per hour and ¬£100+ for q prescription if they want to put you on meds.

I work 20hrs a week and I'm at uni, I can barely afford my rent and basic amenities, let alone ¬£300 A week for therapy. I really need to find an insurance provider which will cover me so please can any of you help?


TLDR: NHS is unable to provide MHC for me and I need to find insurance which will cover my pre existing MH conditions.",18Oct2019,1

54,"First, I'm sorry for my English - it's not my native language and it's very hard for me to speak.

I'm 27 years old, live in small Russian town (Ulyanovsk). I came to reddit because i'm really don't know with whom to talk.

One weak ago i quit my job. Past 3 years i worked in one of the biggest russian media site. My job was editing video, then i was chief of video production.

But once upun a time, in january 2019, I'm just wake up and decide - 'I need to be an fronted-developer'. So I start learning, and it was very hard times. 8-hours at work, then came home, eat dinner and working on coursers till midnight. Day after day, month after month, learning and learning. It was very hard times, when I didn't go out, didn't meet with freinds, didn't play games of watch movies - only studied all my free-time.

So in august I get my first job as junior frontend-developer. It was very cool, I get a lot of practice, but then I started having health problems, so i quit my job, so i can have some mental rest and time for myself.

But now i sitting at my desk, look at the wall and thinks ""what should i do in my life?"". I understand that programming is very hard for me (guess i'm not so clever), it's not so interesting, and it's now what i want to do.

My dream is to be a motion-designer and 3D-modeler, it's my hobby, i like it much more. But it's very hard to find this kind of job. And i spent so much time to learn programming. It was really so hard for me, and now what, it's all was to no purpose?

I'm understand, as frontend-developer it would be easier to find good job, but God, a lot of people studied computer sience in university, so they always would be better than me. And development - uh, i guess it's not for me, i will never be a really good programmer, just because i love art, creative professions, and i'm not an engineer at my mind.

So I don't know what to do. I don't know what work sould i do.

yesterday i was watching a football game with my dad on the couch and i was covered by a blanket, we both were lay down on the couch since the couch goes further if we push it with our bottom and then i have a big cube where we lay our feet.  


so we were watching the game and i decided to mess with my cat and grabbed him from under the table where he was sleeping and '' forced '' him to stay on the couch with us under the blankets ( he hates to be under blankets ) just to mess with him a little, i made him go under and he was, as always, trying to get out so i let him ( i don't abuse him in any way, i just play with him, don't worry guys ).  


he get's out and licks his paw, then proceeds to step over my dad ( which he never does, usually he avoids stepping on people, it's just how he is ) and goes to the far side of the couch.  


then he went to the floor and jumped on me and lay down in top of me.  


i was so damn happy because it's the first time since i have him that he does something like that, i have him for 1 year now, usually he sleeps with us but at our foot, never on us.  


and yesterday he did! he's really the coolest cat, also he was begging for scratches under his mouth which he never does.

I don't even recognize the sounds that came out of me.

Nothing got taken and I'm not hurt but... I've never felt so unsettled. It was 3AM. What kind of rational criminal tries to rob a house when everyone is home sleeping? Don't most robberies happen during the day?

If he had went through the front door, and hell, even taken everything, I don't know if I'd feel as unsettled as I do now. But my bedroom window. It was open. And the worst part was, the curtain was partially open--he should have been able to see me, sleeping, directly in front of the window. Right? Was he just so careless that he didn't look or was he so bold that he didn't care? If he didn't care, will he be back?

I didn't -- I wasn't into him, but then, a few hours later I was thinking that getting fucked would be nice so I texted him. He called me a ""horny bunny"" which I thought was corny but kind of excited me.

He came over to my place and it wasn't long before we were fucking. He really wanted me on top. Not my favorite position since my breasts flap around a lot and I have to hold them in place while balancing on top. And when I get close to an orgasm, I get lightheaded and woozy which makes proper finishing a challenge. 

But I did it, and he then asked if he could cum on my tits. He knew this was a turn on for me from out last encounter so I agreed. 

We cleaned up a bit and he asked if I was interested in another threesome. I said not anytime soon because the two guy thing was a great fantasy but didn't work out the way I had hoped. He then said no... you and another girl and me.

I had to tell him that I'd never been with a woman and it wasn't something that I fantasized about in general. ""But would you do it?""

94,"Be me. 21y/o with a wide range of music. Plays too much pc games. Physically unattractive.

In this class i took, i tried my best to be active in the discussions to get my grades up (shifted majors cuz im dumb and lazy). Sometime in the middle of the semester i met this girl in class after she moved seats, lets call her Summer. Summer was one of the girls in class that people consider to be beautiful and damn was she beautiful. 

After moving seats we naturally interacted for the class and we got in contact with each other to attend some seminars that were required for the class. So me trying to keep it cool i helped Summer out and we went to these seminars, though in groups so i didnt get much time to be with her alone.

After the class we naturally didn‚Äôt have anything else to talk about each other. Or so was what i thought. Little did I know Summer had asked one of my friends about me as she said she was interested about me. This hella shocked me as this was Summer we talking about, the damn beauty that even other guys fantasize about. My friend being the great guy he is told me about this which I definitely is thankful for and grabbed the chance to come in contact w/ her thru Facebook. 

We chatted and got to know each other until i told Summer that i had a crush on her (she got a bit mad at my friend for telling me what she told him). While chatting we talked about the songs we listen to, and there she introduced me to Honne - Me&amp;You and a few other of their songs. That time I didn‚Äôt really click much with their music but I did think that it sounded great. So a few days of chatting passes and i helped her get an internship that would allow us to spend time together. Unfortunately I accepted an offer before Summer got herself accepted on one. 

Instead i helped her look for one and drove her from uni to the internship to process. While waiting for the process we waited in my car watched 500 Days of Summer but watched it halfway before we needed to go. In this movie there was a scene where they made out, so Summer was hoping that I would make a move but unfortunately I had little courage to kiss her and feared that doing so might ruin what we had. Fast forward a couple weeks she got her internship we kept on chatting and see each other less and less. Summer went silent due to family matters and I had less contact with her. 

After a few weeks I was getting worried that she wouldnt reply anymore and that when we do eventually chat it wouldnt be as it was before. So i did some digging on her social media and found that she was having a more intimate talk with another guy. So i confronted her about it and she said that she was sorry.

So that is it. I fucked up. I didnt do things i should have. Because I was too damn scared. I let Summer get away. It didnt hit me as much when it happened. But now on some cold nights at around 3am where I cant sleep. I listen to Honne and feel how dumb I was for not committing as much as I should have. Its stifling sometimes but I guess me and Summer was never in a relationship, maybe the time wasnt right, and the love was never really there to start.",18Oct2019,1

WARNING GRAPHIC

I don't really know how to start this so i guess i will just go straight into this. i'm a guy and when i was 13 i self harmed, i know why i did it but i seriously regret it and would never do it again. this was only one time but i properly cut into my arm and have left permanent scars that will not go away, i even carved a word into my arm(upper forearm, side facing away from me) and now there is a 'I' shaped scar along with other white lines. i didn't know the consequences of this when i was doing it, i didn't know how much it would affect me but it has turned me into someone i never wanted to be, shy, nervous, anxiety-ridden, and unsociable. i never wanted it to be like this, when i was young i always liked sports and wanted to one day join the army, that was my dream but it was ruined my one mistake. my whole life was ruined my it. i have been in hoodies and long sleeves for the past 3 years to the point where i don't know if i'm being paranoid or not but i am sure everyone knows about the scars but just doesn't say anything about it. i also turned to smoking and doing drugs since it happened and that has only added to the mental problems to the point where i just don't know if i can go on anymore, sometimes i wake up wishing i never woke up. i have contemplated suicide since it happened but will never bring a blade to my skin again after how bad this whole thing has fucked me up. I want to just live my life, i want to go swimming, go to a hot country, see the world, play football, wear a t-shirt, talk to a girl, just be normal, but i just cant and i don't think i ever will. i know i haven't asked any questions but what i'm really asking for is to just get some support and for someone to speak to, i have never spoken to anyone about this.

before someone says to 'embrace my scars' i just cant and would rather hide them than bare them out, i am always already worried about what people think about me and this would tip me over the edge

sorry if this is all over the place, i just had to get it out there. thank you for taking the time to read this",18Oct2019,2
99,"Or is it just that I am overthinking it and being too close minded? Sorry for the long read, tldr at the bottom. Any advice or experience is welcome.

Background info- 29 year old male, married 4 years as of this month but total relationship time of 10 years. 

Story- I just recently took a big step for myself and decided that I needed therapy. I saw a crisis counselor last week because I couldn't even find the energy or motivation to go to work. My wife and I are now semi-seperated; still living in the same house but separate rooms and routines. We only recently had a big fight which has led to the separation, within the last month. No cheating on either side, just personal issues. I went and enrolled in a therapy program with the help of my mother and sister. After the crisis counseling session they recommended that I see a psychiatrist and then come back to follow up for an evaluation and further therapy sessions. Here's where I am having an issue. I saw this guy, a psychiatric nurse practitioner, and I don't feel like he helped me more than just talk down to me. An issue arose when I informed him that I vape marijuana (legal state). He didn't have the typical reaction that I normally get i.e. lazy pothead, stoner, loser, so on and so forth. We discussed some of my issues and he then decided that meds weren't really an answer that I should just get further counseling. I mentioned that I didn't think so either but that I was kind of glad because I'm not a fan of medicine for mental health but came in from the recommendation from the counselor. He then laughed and then compared my need for prescription glasses would be no different than any meds he could prescribe.  Apples to oranges comparison as I perceived it, which is a major irritant/frustration of mine. Then of course I had to defend with that i prefer more natural answers and help that medication based ones. Which was fired right back with pot is not natural either. Not wanting any confrontation I just sat back and shut up while still feeling as if I was being judged and talked down to. 

Full question- Does it seem if I am being too close minded and that's why I felt talked down to? Or should I request a different psychiatrist for the next appointment they assign after my next counseling session because I don't feel as if he's going to do his best to help? 

TLDR: saw a psychiatric nurse practitioner who talked down to me and compared prescription drugs to prescription glasses after mentioning that I smoked weed.",18Oct2019,1

I‚Äôve recently moved to a new country. I don‚Äôt speak the main language, so making friends‚Äîmuch less meeting dates‚Äî has been frustrating to say the least. I keep finding myself yearning for my ex and what we had; though it was long distance, it was so fulfilling emotionally.

105,"So to start from the beginning I  spent 3 months abroad away from my girlfriend  of 3 years. As I was getting on the plane home she rang me to say she wanted to breakup. 11hour flight was hell. Then when I got home and met her she said she met someone else when I was away. Then I gave her the presents I got for her when I was away because I felt like it wouldn't be me to this them away and if I held onto them it would only cause me pain.

Then a week later she posts on Reddit about her sex life with this new guy. My housemate told her I could see it so then that was taken down. After that there wasn't any communication except for me asking for my things back. But she didn't give back the keys to my apartment. And ignored ignored my messages.

Meanwhile I'm still in contact with her mother because we go to the same yoga class and running events.  So I asked her mother to get involved. Then my housemate gave me my keys back a few days later. 

Now what was some consolation to all this is that her whole family all the way to her grandparents and cousins had some really nice things to say about me and we're all embarrassed by her. That helped me not feel like I was completely loosing it. 

Now fast forward over 2months after the breakup and I'm finally in a good place and the ex texts me saying she wants to get to a place where we can be civil and happy for eachother. I reply saying that would require some communication. To which I get a reply saying it's her friend and the ex is too drunk to reply. I go to reply a few days later(today) and she has blocked me. I've no idea what the f**k to make of this.

I know I could never get back with her. I have more self respect than that but I really loved her so I find it really hard to not care about her. Several of her friends have said that she developed a drinking problem while I was abroad. So I worry about her a good deal because I don't want her to be in a bad place.

There are people who have it so much worse than I do and they still work and go to school. I don't know how they do it, but they are living proof that I am not trying hard enough. I'm not invalidating anyone, because everyone is different and people who have ""less anxiety"" or ""less depression"" (they are still worthy of treatment and love and appreciation) than others are still struggling with their own battles.

Its not like the old days where you walked into a record label and gave them your demo hoping they would throw money at you, you have to do everything yourself nowadays

I can't really make myself truly interested in anything recreational besides drinking and smoking weed. 

Some people probably just experience life more intensely, and I actually enjoy my detachment from it sometimes, makes things easier, but I don't think I've felt like I've actually felt anything my entire life. When I get drunk I come closer I guess, one reason I drink too much. Nothing makes me happy, or sad, truly. Except myself, I'm always plenty sad over my life situation and general life and chronic ineffectiveness.

I tell myself sometimes that what I want is to feel something, but that isn't true.
