I was born in Indianapolis, Indiana in March of 1998. My parents got married shortly after and divorced by the time I was 2. My dad had a big drug and money problem. He would take things from my mom and sell them to buy drugs and alcohol. At some point, my mom had enough of it and divorced him. While my mom and I were moving to Georgia to live near other family members, the police were discovering his body with a gunshot wound to the head underneath a bridge a few miles away from his apartment. She suspects that he owed money to various dealers and was unable to pay them off. 

Things were fairly calm for several years following his funeral. Most of my family moved to Georgia and all lived within an hour or so from each other. Even with Social Security checks from my dad’s passing, my mom struggled to support me alone though and when I was younger, I failed to see how much she struggled just trying to feed me and keep the lights on. Looking back on it now, I don’t think my mom ate most nights. Things stayed stable though and she managed on her own until I was ten.

When I was ten years old, my mom remarried the man she is still with today. We moved in with him shortly after and things felt better. Two incomes helped us to be able to live more comfortably, but everything wasn’t fantastic. My step father and I bickered constantly. He was very... aggressive. More so than I was used to at least. He swore and told me things for how they were. Something I never got to experience when I was just living with my mom. It was through these conversations that I learned how much debt my mom had accumulated over the past years trying to care for us. 

At twelve, my half sister was born. Of course going from an only child to a brother wasn’t an easy transition, but I eventually got over it. Money got tighter of course because kids are expensive! We were stable though because my mom and step father were making more money than they were previously. My social security checks were being used to put me into a private school because the local public schools had very bad ratings. All was well for a couple more years. I stayed in that private school from grades 5 to 7 when we finally moved into a better school district. My parents got quite lucky finding a foreclosed house for us to move into. It was much nicer than our first house, and had it not been foreclosed in there would have been no way we could have afforded it. 

Eighth grade was my first experience in public school since I was in elementary, and let me tell you it was a culture shock. Though my step father and his friends swore frequently, I had never seen people my age act the same or say the same things that these adults were saying. That changed in middle school. I was introduced to all kinds of different people who all talked in many different ways. My first couple months in that school were a bit of a struggle for me. I wasn’t making friends very easily, and I didn’t quite know how to fit in. I even got so low as to attempt taking my life. I found a gun in my parents room one day and held it to my head. I loaded it and pulled the trigger. To this day, I have no idea how that gun didn’t fire. I had fired that gun before and I knew how it worked. I did everything right and my life should have ended right in that moment. Fortunately, some higher power chose to spare me that day. Slowly I began to mesh with my peers and even formed a nice group of friends and finished out the year strong. 

Now it was time for me to move on to high school. Freshman. Bottom of the totem pole. I thought public middle school was shocking, boy was I in for a surprise my freshman year. My group of friends from middle school carried over to high school and I eventually met my first girlfriend through them. She was easily the most beautiful girl I had ever seen and we shared so much in common. I continued growing as a person through her and my friends until I felt nice and comfortable in my own skin. Things at home weren’t as smooth though. My step father grew more aggressive and started drinking more and more. Everyday we would end up yelling at each other and even physically fighting some days. The way he talked to me destroyed my self esteem and led me into a sort of depression. Being at home made me think back to my suicide attempt and how much easier it would have been if the gun had fired. I shared these feelings with my girlfriend and she was an angel of sorts. She helped me realize that I was worth way more than what my step father thought. She had issues of her own though, and we formed this incredible bond between us. We were both devoted to making sure the other was happy with life. 

My freshman year ended quickly and without much drama. Just me and my friends growing together and navigating through life. We would hang out on weekends when we could and really just enjoyed being around each other. We were a support group for each other as well as friends. The summer between sophomore and freshman year is when my girlfriend and I started to explore our relationship on a sexual level. Some may say it was too early, but it felt natural for us perhaps because we had such a strong connection.

Sophomore year was maybe even more uneventful than my freshman year. It was the summer afterwards where my friends and I started experimenting a little more. We started smoking weed and drinking from time to time. It was a lot of fun I can’t lie. We were all enjoying the feeling of being under the influence of these drugs and we used pretty much every time we hung out. Things stayed like this all the way up until senior year. We all had jobs for the most part so we had less time to hang out, but we were all understanding of that fact and tried to work around each other’s schedules. 

The beginning of my senior year was pretty rough. The girl I had gotten so close to and loved more than anything or anyone started acting differently. I tried to pinpoint the issue and figure out what was going wrong, but for the life of me I couldn’t figure it out. She stopped spending time with me and our friends. I couldn’t keep up trying to include her if she was just going to blow me off. Eventually I broke up with her, and it shattered both of our worlds. She missed school for a couple weeks afterwards and I sat at home crying each night. How could I throw away the person that meant so incredibly much to me? She was my everything. I coped but not in the most healthy way. I started drinking and smoking more as well as having sex with whoever I could. Chasing a feeling of love that was gone. My grades began to suffer and the straight As I had all throughout high school turned into barely passing some classes. My friends were there for me but with us growing older, working, and starting college soon, it began getting harder to find time to hang out. 

I was accepted into an incredible engineering program at a top university despite my GPA taking a dip my senior year. I had just started dating a new girl who had graduated a year before me. Chasing that feeling of love caught me again. Instead of pursuing my dream I settled at a community college so I could stay near my new girlfriend. Turns out she was cheating on me with her old boyfriend for months, but it was too late. I had already began a semester at the community college. I should have broken up with her then, but I didn’t want to lose that feeling of affection. I forgave her and she promised it would never happen again. I believed her. 

The community college was so incredibly easy for me. So easy that I felt I didn’t even need to show up for class. I blew off class almost everyday to hang out with my girlfriend instead. Long story short, I was placed on academic probation for failing grades and missed assignments. I was unable to reenroll and my parents wanted answers. Where do you go if you can’t go to college or stay at home? That’s right. The military. I enlisted in the US Air Force in April of 2017. Before I left for basic training though, I fell once more to the feeling of chasing love. I knew when I joined the military that I could be sent anywhere in the world, and the only way I could be sure my girlfriend would be allowed to come with me is if we were married. I got married at 19 years old to the girl who cheated on me and inspired me to drop out of the engineering program. I just wasn’t willing to go through the pain of a broken relationship again. 

While in basic training, I received a letter in the mail from my now wife. Accusing me of stealing money from her parents. Apparently the police had been called and I was under investigation for theft by taking of $10,000. All of this took me by shock. My life was already upside down. I was in another state learning to be an Airman in the USAF. As if that wasn’t stressful enough, I have this court case to worry about now. My wife and I exchanged fairly hostile letters for my remainder of time at basic training. I hated her for accusing me of such a ridiculous act. How could she ever believe I would do something like that? 

It wasn’t until I was in Tech School and I had steady contact again that I heard the whole story. Her parents had sold her on this idea that I stole money from them one day when we were house sitting for them. She bought right into the story and even posted some pretty hateful stuff on social media about me. I was beside myself on what to do. I kept begging and pleading with her to understand that I would never have done such a thing. Eventually she snapped out of it and realized that maybe I was right. Maybe I hadn’t actually done that. See this wasn’t the first time her parents had tried to accuse someone of stealing. Initially they tried to accuse my wife’s grandmother of theft. My mother in law accused her own mother of theft! How fucked is that? And here it was happening to me too. 

After clearing things up with my wife, I learned that she had cheated on me again while I was at basic. She had slept with her ex boyfriends best friend because she was “mad at me for having stole from her parents and didn’t know what to do.” Now she says she regrets it because she knows I didn’t actually steal from them. Again I forgave her and we set on trying to figure out how to get her parents off my back. 

I heard of a warrant for my arrest while still in tech school. I flew home to fulfill the warrant and was released on bail. I finished my training and moved to my first duty station. Instead of getting sent far away from Georgia, I was sent right back here so I would be able to fight my court case. While infuriated that I was stuck in Georgia once more, I was happy that I was within driving distance of the court house where the proceedings would talk place. 

The facts of the case were laughable. No evidence. Yet things were stacked against me. See, the officer my mother in law called to report a theft was a long time friend from high school, and wasn’t it fortunate that the DA and my mother in law knew each other well? See my mother in law worked at the pediatrician the DA’s kids frequented. Seems a little fishy to me, but that’s besides the point. It was made clear to me by my lawyer that someone was pulling strings and fighting to take this case all the way. Frankly I couldn’t afford to continue the fight. The lawyer fees were extreme and I was still in debt several thousand dollars for my bail. I swallowed my pride and took a plea deal. I plead guilty to something I never did just so I could move on with my life. I was fighting in court for a year and a half and I was burnt out. I couldn’t continue. The plea deal wasn’t too bad so I felt comfortable accepting it. Five years felony probation, some community service, and $10,000 restitution. Best part: if I complete my probationary term without issue I’ll have a clean criminal record. No remnants of the felony I plead to. 

The military wasn’t too happy with the outcome of course and I faced an administrative discharge. I was being seen by a psychiatrist on base at the time however, and she diagnosed me with schizophrenia. See all the stress from court was weighing down on me hard. I was severely depressed and anxious all the time. I was even having psychotic episodes. Hence the diagnosis. I had stayed in a psychiatric hospital for a few days when things were really bad, but after getting my meds straightened out, I was able to function normally again. The conclusion of my court case made me feel so much better even if it wasn’t a picture perfect ending. I felt so much relief that I stopped taking my medication and all of my previous psychotic symptoms faded away. My schizophrenia diagnosis proved to be incorrect. I was just under such an immense amount of stress that I cracked. 

It’s now 2019, I am 21 years old and awaiting discharge orders from the Air Force. Those friends from high school have gone their own way as they should. Meanwhile, I still think and dream about my ex girlfriend from those years ago occasionally. I resent my wife for cheating on me and accusing me of theft. I blame her for me dropping out of college even though that was a personal decision and I know it. She didn’t tell me to, but I did it anyway because I was chasing love. It’s because I’m chasing love now that I won’t leave her. She’s a depressed and anxious person herself and I fear me leaving her would lead to some very very unfortunate events unfolding. I don’t want that. I care for her. So I’ll stay where I am. Keeping her together even though she’s torn me apart.",06Jun2019,1
1,"I'm sorry for the long vent. I'll try keep it as short as I can.

So a few months ago, my dad had a stroke (he's in his early 60s) they ran every test they could and the doctors all say that it is stress related. My dad runs his own business and his job is very stressful especially since it is manual labor and he is getting older and there is no retirement plan.
Obviously me, my mom, and my brother were worried about his health and were there for him.

Last night, my mom comes into my bedroom sobbing asking to talk to me. She said how my dad's stroke was stress related. And the 2 things he's stressed about most are work and me.  My first reaction was ""why me?"" since I'm 25 years old and I've never been a bad kid growing up. I work full time and I recently withdrew from my masters degree because of depression and other mental health issues I've been dealing with. But they know that...and they have been somewhat supportive of my decision to do so.

My mom says that her and my dad are both constantly stressed and wondering if them paying for my 4 year degree was all for nothing and a big waste of money since I haven't  completed my masters degree yet. And how is health is very fragile and I need to do better by lessening that for him. I just stood there cause it's like should I not exist? Should I just kill myself to ease the burden? Should I speed up time for when I do have a masters degree? As much as I care about my dad's health, I really don't know what to do in terms of me and my life...

She just kept sobbing and choking out ""he's all I have!"" at me.

No part of me tries to make my dad stressed but like I'm just trying to live my life. It wasnt my intention if it didn't go as per planned..
I don't want to sound selfish, but like there's no way in hell they were never not going to send me to college they would never allow that. And I'm sorry that I'm not smart enough to become some well off brain surgeon
As much as I want to ensure that I'll be alright in the future, I really don't have any answers right now
I'm trying to live my life and figure shit out, but I'm guilted for doing so and the reason for my dad's stroke by doing that.

Overall, it really made me feel like I'm constantly a burden and disappointment to them (mainly because they chose to pay for my undergrad tuition). I've shown them I'm grateful for them doing that and I never even asked for them to help me.  I'm not quite sure what point my mom was trying to make. She didn't have many other suggestions other than ""ensuring to my fahher that I go back to school for my masters"" but I'm not even quite sure I want to do that and might want to go a different route with the job I have know by moving up in the business.

I just felt like total shit after she was done. Like I'm just disappointing and bring nothing to them but regret and a financial burden. But most of all... Like I'm the reason for my dad having a stroke.

I couldn't even look at my mom this morning and she asked me why I was mad at her and why I don't care about my dad's health and wellbeing.

But that's not it at all.. I just feel extremely hurt that 1. She thinks that I don't care. And 2. By the things she said to me. How she could think that putting that kinda burden on me is not going to effect me? I almost questioned suicide.  I feel like a terrible person.",06Jun2019,2
2,"I've been contending with this thought for some time now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 23, high school graduate working in the IT field making good money, but my commute is about 1h15m one way. I live with my parents, have had the opportunity to live on my own for a period of time when I was 18, but I found myself in a bind when I was laid off from my first professional endeavor, and its wired me a bit differently ever since. I was mortified, as I drained my accounts and went into debt to try to stay afloat while I looked for another job that was local to my apartment at the time, and eventually it reached the breaking point where I couldn't feed myself, or pay my bills, so I moved back home and haven't left since. 

&amp;#x200B;

A lot has changed, I worked my way up the pay ladder over the last few years, worked locally to pay my car down until my current job of 2 years where I make that livable wage. The first year of commuting, my nearly paid off car started to break relentlessly. I'm a self taught auto mechanic, so I knew how to fix it on the cheap, but as time went by, more complicating, more expensive things began to decay. There was a point when, for a month straight, I would spend every single weekend repairing something that broke during the middle of the week. There was another day when I was leaving my neighborhood that an axle decided to let go, and I had to call out of work and rush to replace it before the following day.

&amp;#x200B;

My live-in girlfriend of a year at the time had recently admitted that she had cheated on me, that broke me for a while. She had two close family members, (step brother, followed by step mom) kill themselves in relatively short succession while we were dating, too.. and I was working over nights at the time, so sleeping during the day was rough on my psyche, and hard on our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

About two weeks after she told me that, and it seemed like we were working through it, she left me. around the same time, the transmission in my car would not shift into 2nd or 3rd gear anymore. The stress got to me, and I dropped down to one of the lowest of lows I've ever felt before. I started to abuse alcohol, binged on acid, tried everything to just stop feeling, or if I was going to feel, break it down, and I eventually broke myself down. I got really suicidal towards the tail end of it too, started to do reckless things on the highway, bought a gun to put  to my head and pull the trigger on an empty chamber every night just to satisfy the deranged craving to die (I never bought ammunition for it).  I knew I wasn't going to go through with it, after watching how it affects the ones left behind, but my mind wasn't really working correctly anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

It came to an end when my sister found the gun under my bed. I was at work, halfway through my shift, when EMS and Police showed up knocking on one of the mantrap doors to my office at around 3AM. I ran to my car and left the building. Waited for about half an hour in my car at a Marta station, before eventually making my way back to work. They were gone, but I thought I was doomed anyway because they showed up. You know how corporate America has protocols to follow when things happen.

&amp;#x200B;

When I came in the following day for work, I was pulled aside by my Director, HR liason, the night shift manager, and told that I am being put on an FMLA leave of absence (unpaid) for 30 days, handed a contact card for the employee assistance program, and will need doctors clearance to return to work once the duration of the leave has lapsed. I was astonished, to say the least.. and I did not realize that time was something I needed. I'm not the type of person to take a vacation, so it was a breathe of fresh air. I spent the time traveling, visiting friends that were out of state, seeing new sights to distract my mind from the absolute shit show that was my brain at that time, and my EAP paired me with a really good therapist who helped me work through things logically. I was formally diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress &amp; Major Depression, heavily attributed to by my substance abuse, but I was on the road to recovery.  


When I came back to work, they chose to put me on day shift. Ever since then, things have been a lot better. A few months later, I received a promotion, I traded in my car for a newer one, and built my credit score to something that I can really work with. Still single, still live with my parents, but with a lot more money, and a lot less shit going on.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't really intend to write all of this, but it started coming out of my fingers and didn't stop. I'm unsure of where to go from here, but I'm okay with the way things are going right now. Taking it a day at a time.   


Shit gets rocky, but it does get better.",06Jun2019,1
3,"I don't want to get into details about myself , so we're going to create two fake cities. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Hometown , my hometown obviously 
2. FreshTown, which I lived at in my early 20s, and returned to, and currently live.  


First off, fuck r/relationships, fuck anyone who spends time posting in that place tearing down other people . I was in a situation where I had returned to Hometown to look after a parent. Almost immediately things turned to shit.   
I was wasting well over 1k a month on 'helping family' at a point.  Dating in Hometown is best characterized by two events , first I had the other guy point a gun in my face- the girl for all this drama was for would later laugh about it all and brag about having a 'friend' pay her rent. How you pay your rent is between you and god, but don't brag. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second I was setup for a robbery off a dating site( technically I guess someone totally wanted to come over, their car got stuck at 1am in an alley and instead of calling AAA , they wanted me to 'save them ').   


Fuck Hometown. 

&amp;#x200B;

r/relationships told me to have a better 'attitude' towards wasting much of my 20s, my sibling not giving a shit, not contributing in at all, etc.   


Even r/raisedbynarcissists was absolutely useless. No, you will not find quality people in every single city. Some cities are fucked beyond all hope . If anything I find ' have a better attitude , SURE YOU HAD A GUN POINTED AT YOUR FACE, BUT COME ON, INSTALL DATING APP X , IT'LL WORK' to be extremely condescending.   


Freshtown made my early 20s amazing, I was able to lose 60 pounds, finally date, lose my virginity , learn to drive , and establish my career all within about 18 months.  


So what happened once I decided my family and the idiots of reddit weren't going to run my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I moved back to Freshtown, and within a few months I had the best sex of my life. She actually texted me to come visit her in another city, we had more amazing sex, then she basically said she didn't want anything serious, and while this sort of hurt, the sex was really really good. Like , I'm just happy the universe gave me such a gift !   


The problem with letting other people determine your life is none of those people really give a flying fuck.   


With Reddit in particular people will shit on you because it makes them feel good about themselves.   


My tip to anyone else who feels their family is pimping them is to book a flight and leave.   
Leave today, the moment you take control of your life, you get to change your own story.   
The only difference between me and all the depressed folks on r/ForeverAlone is I decided to take my own life in my hands.  Expecting other people to take pity on you is pointless. So what, you told your tale to a bunch of other depressed people and you got some upvotes. Your still wallowing in your  


Hell, Freshtown might not even be my last stop.   


Why not live in China, Sweden, Moroco. The world is mine to discover.   


Outside of dating, I just find life to be easier outside of Hometown, people are nicer EVERYWHERE else ! I've traveled tones, I've lived in other places. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's add a new city , AltTown. In Alttown I spent about a year between Hometown and Freshtown, dated a great older( I think 6 or 7 years) woman and the whole thing was straightforward !   


This all isn't even to say Hometown is a bad place, you might love it. You might think I'm full of shit and have nothing but good memories.   


Anyway, take control now, love life, peace.",06Jun2019,11
4,"I've hated myself since I found I was small. 

I was in Grade 9 when a girl pointed out to me that I'm short and how she doesn't consider that to be manly or attractive. I'm 26 now. I dread being a small man every day

Since then, I've contniously had negative experiences like this, especially with woman.

I've never felt like a man. I don't feel like I can be attractive. I also don't think most women actually find short guys sexually attractive.

Sure, they might end up in a relationship with them but mainly they want him as a provider.

I hate that people feel like that I'm a pushover. People talk over me, talk down to me, belittle what I have to say.

People say you should act confident but it's hard to do that to as a small guy.

Honestly, I just hate myself. I tried working out but I overdid it so bad that I have chronic injuries and can't work out anymore.

I hate myself. A small man is such pathetic mediocrity. A man is supposed to be strong. Look at super heroes. They are always bigger men because we associate better things with bigger man. All my idols were generally bigger men.

I hate myself so much that whenever I'm in a setting with bigger guys, I feel inferior. I feel like no woman would want me.",06Jun2019,6
5,"As you all know it's Eid, meaning festivity, food and most importantly people. (Eid Mubarak to everyone :)) Eid is a time where people go visit their friends, families, neighbours and most importantly spend time with the loved ones.  For Eid our parents, especially our moms, have to prepare a large amount of food for surprise guests or people we wouldn't expect. 
Now my family shifts apartments every now and then (due to multiple different reasons) and we newly shifted to a different city. Being new to the neighborhood and the building, we didn't know anyone and the main reason we shifted was to meet my brother's wants (his friends lived in this building and he felt as if it would be helpful if we lived closer to them as his a-levels are coming up. ¿ Yea idk why my parents agreed and I have no control over their decisions) Note the area we moved in was infested with people from my country; Bangladesh and everywhere I went I would spot at least 4-6 Bengalis.
Eid came up and as usual, my mom prepared a whole load of food the night before Eid. I helped her out till 1 am but dozed off to sleep while she got everything ready for the following day without taking a rest as she was hopeful that this Eid would be unforgettable. 
It was 11 am and the first day of Eid and my mom decides to invite my brother's friends to our house as we didn't know anyone else. They shrugged off my mom's invitation and made up random excuses to not come over (eg ""Oh AuNtIe I cAnT EAt riCe As I AlReAdY AtE, I CouLd coMe OvEr iF THerE wErE NoOdlEs"" to which my mom made noodles afterwards especially for him which pissed me off cause he still didn't come) the whole day was gone to waste and my family is the type of family who don't really extend our circle of relationships and we usually spend our Eid in my home country with my relatives so this was a new experience. 
My mom got extremely depressed that night and felt heartbroken cause no one came. The least I was expecting was my brother's friend's parents to come, but nope. She felt like all the food she made was useless cause it's a lot and we're just 4 people,, we can't possibly manage to finish the food before it goes bad. I tried to comfort her by hugging her and all the lovely dovey things people do (yea I'm not very good at being comforting) and I tried to lift up her mood by putting on her favourite movie but nothing worked.

I immediately got upset about if and I went to my team leader and assistant manager and refused to take their food to them I wanted them kicked out but my team leader wouldn't coz he said I can't be sure they were making fun of me. later on I had to check the toilets and I walked upstairs to girls toilets and the door opens and it was them girls I looked up and the girl that laughed earlier smiled at me, and I overheard em saying whys a boy going in girls toilets and walked past me as normal.

9,"Its been hard coming to terms with this but im afraid of getting into another relationship. 

Let me explain. 

Im not afraid of meeting knew people or even approaching women,its just getting into a romantic relationship with a woman that im just afraid of now. On top of 3 past failed relationships that ended on bad terms,I've been reading stories about people who have been in relationships for 5+ years only to find out that their partner has been cheeting on them for the majority of relationship or how they broke up/divorced and lost almost everything to their partner. I don't want that to happen to me. I don't want to waste my life loving and giving my best to someone who's just gonna throw it all away. I've been trying to get over this fear though by psyching myself up and telling myself to not worry about it and just focus on the good times. Despite that,the fear stays and i don't know what else i can do to get rid of it. And its crazy,i always tell people i feel better off alone. Less money to spend and less stress to deal with but being alone gets old after a while. You start to miss having someone close to talk to or someone to hold and have genuine good time with romantically. I want to start dating again but with this fear on my back,it's gonna be hard not to look at every girl with a hint of paranoia. This was hard to admit but i had to get it off my chest as it has taken a toll on me emotionally.

I have gone through alcohol, weed, and cigarette abuse to the point where I began to feel the side effects. Now, I am 5 days in away from my bad habits. I just want to know other alternatives on keeping the mind calm and away from chaos. I have the gym, meal prepping, and reading books as a form of escape for me. But the problem is, I feel now that I have wasted my time being sad and angry because I always hold myself accountable for things that are out of my hands. Now that I cut off my bad habits, I want everything fast. I am very impatient because I feel that evrybody is moving forward too damn fast and I feel out of the loop. It's sad but when I was alone and spending time by myself for the past 2 years, it felt like I have understood myself even more. When you choose to be alone you find your truest self. But you sacrifice love, trust, and emotions. Right now, I have friends but I have distanced myself for 2 years and my family I have pushed away for some time because I was going through a rough patch. To this day, my family and old peers reminds me how good of a person I am and I took care of the people I love. I still dont see that in myself and I always over compensate on everything to the point where I completely broke down crying and unable to accept help due to my pride and ego. I honestly dont want sympathy. I keep telling people that cares about me, to understand what I was going through and I dont need them to judge me. I already know I am my biggest critic. FYI, I chose to distance myself because I knew I wont be a good friend with so much negativity inside my head. Those 2 years were brutal, I surrounded myself with toxic people who took advantage of my kindness. To the point where I was robbed gunpoint leading to PTSD. After that incident, I blacked out drinking alchohol with my cousins. Waking up at the hospital with nobody around me, and nobody told me what happened. I didnt have a phone and I was left with a debit card. I discharged myself and found my way back home. From that day, I told myself I can handle anything the world offers to me. Nobody can hurt me or faze me. I am grateful for my past because it made me stronger ans understand my strengths and weaknesses. Now I mostly rely on myself for everything and if I ever ask for help, I let people know that it was my last option. Asking for help from others, means that I am not perfect and I can be vulnerable. In short I hate asking for help unless I have to.",06Jun2019,1

16,"TLDR; I am a 19 male living at home with my family currently. I’m an aspiring musician and traveler. 

Well my situation starts out with me working at a grocery store. My dad told me to get a job so I complied and did exactly that. So for 6 or 7 months I worked at my local grocery store. The job wasn’t so bad, but it has immensely effected my social life and health (mental and physical). I had a major chest surgery and multiple mental illnesses, so completing jobs sometimes is impossible. I decided it was time for me to take a month of from working as my job didn’t pay much anyway and the beginning of the summer has come. My music career was something I wanted to begin as well However my dad has scolded me for even considering this and has violent tantrums for me being unemployed for a short period of time. He also likes to “stalk” me by texting people around me about what I’m doing. Although I am not filled with envy, he also treats my siblings with favoritism as he will be nice to them unconditionally and allow them to make their own decisions. This all makes it very hard to even be in the same room with him. 

I told him that I would do volunteer work the whole time I was unemployed, but he is heartless to the less fortunate and thinks it’s a waste of time (because money is the most important thing in life right?).  I’ve been called a bum by him and the relatives in which he gossips to about me many times in the past.

19,"There's a part of me that I hide inside myself; A part of me I confide in when I need guidance. He is me. Or rather, he *was* me. He's who I strive to be, who I could be if I tried hard enough. My ultimate self, the peak of my own physical excellence. When he'll be, if he ever will be, I'm unsure. He has everything I don't. He never sulks like I do, never afraid to confide in others, never afraid to show emotion. Fucking ripped to hell. His body chiseled by Michelangelo himself. 


He has taken the name of the creature that we both most adore. Harbingers of Odin, father of the holy Thor. Perched upon our shoulder, our skin, eternal, it adorns. The one that came a knocking, knocking on Poe's chamber door. He is Corvus, forevermore.


He is not without flaws, as he is only human. He still struggles with his confidence, although much improved upon than I. He broods like I do. Too much, in fact. His temper has not improved from his previous iteration. Unhealthy, he realizes, of course. But he too has an ideal in mind. ""What more could you possibly want?"" I ask himself. Too long has he focused on himself physically, now he longs to silence the chaos in his mind. He longs to end the dichotomous singularity once and for all. The constantly inconsistent reaffirming contradiction that has plagued us; never vanishing, simply fading. Never enough to rest on our yannis, always reminding us we are never good enough. The voice in our head that says ""In 5 years, no one's going to get that stupid internet joke you put in the last sentence."" A noble goal, however impossible it may seem to me.

21,So I recently broke up with my old boyfriend (if you would like to know why check my profile) and a guy I've known for years decided to cheer me up by watching anime with me. Now he lives 2 states away so we had to vc. 3 hours in we were just chatting before I went to get food. He never told me he was tired so when I come back he's asleep on the phone with me. So I started to sing him lullabies because I know he gets nightmares. He woke up crying happy tears because apparently he was having a terrible nightmare and he suddenly heard me singing.

24,"This is a rather longish post, I cant really make a tldr because it would take a long paragraph to explain this in a summary lol.  But, please attempt to give me some advice. I would really appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I refer to the term ""lazy"" or ""laziness"" a few times here, what I mean by this is my compulsive desire to sit on my couch and rot my brain with videogames/ anime/ reddit/ etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So, for the past like 5+ years, my routine has been exactly the same. I get up, go to work, come home, play videogames/ watch anime, browse reddit for a little bit, go to sleep, repeat. On weekends I usually just waste time doing what I normally do after work. I should also probably point out that I am exhausted by the time I get home. My job isnt super labor intensive, but for some reason around 2-4ish, I start shutting down. When Im finally off at 530, I cant wait to sit down and do absolutely nothing.  I can never get anything done. I have an enormous backlog of shit that should probably receive attention, but I cant bring myself to do anything other than feed my inner desire to do absolutely nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

As some of you may have speculated already, this is an extremely boring existence. In fact, I have come to terms multiple times with how much I hate my life right now. I dont hate my job, I dont hate my family or even my personality, I just despise the massive, unending bordem, and I despise my insatiable need for sitting on my ass and not doing shit. It fucking sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

I have attempted to combat this with many, many, many different hobbies/ pastimes/ changes/ etc. I have tried all of these, but by far this list is not limited to: working out, skateboarding, writing, game design, gardening, fishing, bike riding, poker, guitar playing, reading, and so on and so forth.

&amp;#x200B;

It always ends up the same way. I reach a boiling point of my dull insanity, this causes a momentary deadening of my necessity for absolute laziness. I see something that sparks an interest. I research it, I study it, I practice it, I love it, I progress, I drop it. Yeah, I drop it. I lose interest. I dont bother anymore. This is due to either an incident that kills interest or I just lose my commitment from my desire slowly increasing akin to fanning a flame. Like skateboarding for example, I was doing great, loved the change in lifestyle, loved learning, loved the aesthetic and the community. I ended up hurting myself, was out for a month, never picked up my board again. In game design, I spent weeks devoting myself to learning and making a game with GS2, I even splurged on the indie dev package, which was like 50 bucks. Slowly but surely, my commitment, my devotion, faded. In its place was this monster of a desire. The ""wanting to do nothing"" grew, It didnt share space with my new hobby, it forced it out. I currently have no interest whatsoever in opening my laptop and launching the game engine, nor do I want to watch/ read tutorials on design. I just dont care anymore. It has been eradicated as something I was extremely interested in.

&amp;#x200B;

Whats crazy, and this is the meta portion of my title, is that in the beginning of my journey in my skating, is I knew how it would end. I knew I would lose interest. I fucking called it. I didnt want to believe it, because I was having so much fun. But, I knew, sooner or later, I would drop it, just like how Ive dropped every god damn one of every god damn thing I had any remote interest in.

&amp;#x200B;

I cant stand it anymore. I dont know if I can remember ever feeling this way, but as Im writing this, right now Im doing the same fucking shit I was doing hours ago after work. Sitting on my ass, not progressing my life, being a complete lazy douche bag. I dont know what to do, I cant shake my need for laziness, its almost a permanant part of me, and that scares the shit out of me. I dont want to be like this for another 5 years, let alone the rest of my life. It wont get easier, with age, time, and events, itll be more and more difficult to take control of my life, and I so very, desperately want this. I cannot describe how happy I would be if I wasnt chained to my fucking couch, but it has always given me a safe place, a warmth that is unparalleled in anything else. I cant find the replacement, but it seems that this may be the only option. I dont know how much I could bare to go cold turkey, it scares me just as much as staying like this. Talk about a catch 22 right? Damned if I do, damned if I dont. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, please give me some advice. I dont want this anymore, but at the same time, I need it. Its like a fucking drug, and I have an ample supply of it.

I get jittery, and start shaking, and I honestly feel sick. Before anyone says it’s a sugar crash, I get mine without sugar. Even if I have caffeinated drinks at home with no sugar I still feel like shit after having one. This makes somewhat sense when I compare it to my alcohol tolerance.

28,"Do not read this story if you are sensitive to topics such as:  
Self-harm, depression, and bullying  
I'm a 14-year-old girl who suffers from depression and anxiety. I know a lot of teenage girls say this and it's normally not true but you'll see it's real in just a minute.   
I was bullied for three years, never anything too bad, but just enough to get to me. I was always on the edge and it all started 5th grade.  
In 5th grade there was a new girl who came to my school and my best friend became best friends with her. I was so mad. The girl and I got in a lot of fights, we tried to kill each other left and right and most days I dreaded going to school because of her. Finally 5th grade ended and 6th grade started. Ironically that girl and I became best friends and left the first girl. Well that year goes by and a new girl moved into the apartments I lived in and she hated me. I had just gotten rid of a bully and now I had a new one. She was 3 years older than me so she intimidated me. I hated going outside, I hated talking to people, I was jumpy, I barely ate. It got bad. 6th grade ended and that summer was hell for me. The girl who hated me at the apartments, lets call her Chase, would pick on me every day. She would chase me around the yard, she would threaten me, push me, yell at me, take everything away from me. She even managed to take my then ""boyfriend"" from me. I stopped going outside completely, I ate only pickles and bread and I would stay up late every night slitting my wrists, hoping to bleed out. This was the same year I found out that my real dad had killed himself when I was 2. It hit me hard. I knew he had died but I never knew how. Once I found out I was never the same.  
I had tried many times that summer to die, but I never could. I had too much to live for and I knew it. Slowly my thoughts got to me. My mind became the most toxic thing in my life, even worse than Chase. I didn't tell anyone how I felt, not even my best friend Jackson. He thought everything was just fine, everyone did.   
7th grade started and the bullying got worse. Now it wasn't Chase. It was my school. Paper was thrown at me, people whispered about me, laughed at me, hated me, hit my arms so it would make my cuts sting, someone even went as far as throwing food at me during lunch. I felt so ashamed and guilty. I felt like even my friends didn't want me. Chase and I became good friends and she tried to help me (I don't know what it is with me becoming friends with my bullies but that's fine.) but it never worked. I was sad, alone, empty. People called me a whore, thot, hoe, attention-seeker, loser, the loner and so many other things. I can't even remember all of them at this point. My aunt found out about my cutting and sent me to counseling so I could ""be fixed."" If you have this problem, you don't need to be fixed, you need to be helped and encouraged and loved.   
I stopped texting people, my arms were covered in red marks and dots of blood, so were my legs, ankles, hands, stomach, it got so bad. I couldn't hide them half the time anymore, but 7th grade ended and things were fine for a while. Then I dated a guy over the summer and he cheated on me. That made me spiral deeper and deeper into whatever black hole I was in. It didn't help that at the time I was trying to come to terms with who I was. I knew I was Bisexual, but if I admitted it my aunt (whom I lived with at the time) told me I wasn't and I was just confused and I believed her. I lived in shame for years. I lived with the thought of constantly wanting to kill myself and hoping I'd die every morning. 8th grade started and it didn't get better.  
I didn't mean to but I started something with a girl and she bullied me for a week or two before she got expelled for something else. I haven't seen her since. I had just moved back in with my parents and they pushed down on me like a rock on paper. They were acting like I was five and I hated it. Soon, I was in a car crash and it made my anxiety worse. I could barely get into a car without forcing myself. It was rough. It made things so much harder on me. Everything scared me and I was still self-harming. By then I had met my boyfriend whom I still dating for almost a year now. He has helped me so much. I have tried so hard to be better for him and I'm getting there.   
I still have panic attacks quite a bit, I still have doubts, I still freak out from time to time but that's not important. When I started self-harming I didn't know what some consequences of doing it would be. If I would have known how deadly it could have been I wouldn't have done it. Yes I wanted to die at the time and I didn't care, but when I started I could still see hope. I never thought about infections, I never thought about rust on the blades I was using, I never thought about the blood loss, I thought about my pain which is completely normal.  Please, if you are going through ANYTHING like this I encourage you to get a therapist, to throw away any blades you have, talk to someone who doesn't have a self-harm problem. Reach out to someone, you will feel better. Contact me, I'm not the most credible source and I may be a stranger but I've been through this and I want people to know my story and know what could happen. I want to help people. Reach out to someone, I promise you will feel so much better.",06Jun2019,3

I do everything in the house. Everything. His laundry, folded away nicely. I make his breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday. I clean. 

He leaves sticky wrappers on the floor. Plates, glasses, just anywhere. He can’t even put them in the dishwasher. Everyday I pick up bits of trash he’s left. Mail will be left wherever he puts it down and never touched again. He literally gets home from work, goes to the couch, and gets fed before going to bed. 

I politely ask him to put his trash in the bin after he’s done and he rolls his eyes at me. That annoys the shit out of me, obviously. So an argument starts and he demands me to show him where his mess is. The one that I’ve already tidied up! His argument is that the house is clean, why am I complaining. 

He once didn’t unpack his suitcase for three months. And when he finally did, he had just taken all the contents out, put it into piles on the floor and shut the suitcase. Everything still in the middle of the room. I found the bag of sunscreen behind the door. Then he complains the room is cluttered. 

I’ve never watched CSI, but if I am out for an evening, I can trace exactly what he’s done that evening. food wrappers will be everywhere and grubby fingerprints will be on the microwave. 

I once asked him to help me change the bed sheets. He put the new sheets over the dirty ones. 
I asked him once to clear his clutter from the coffee table. He gathered it all and moved it to another corner of the room. 
Well, how can I complain about him when he’s done what I’ve asked?? Now I’m OCD according to him. 

I went on strike for a while because I wanted him to see his own filth. He apologised and said he would make more effort when he ran out of underwear. 

Obviously this posts existence shows that didn’t last. Honestly I’m about ready to smother him in his sleep (jk jk but really).

It just feels like everyday I tidy and clean and cook, then wake up the next day and I have to do it all over again because he doesn’t pick up after himself. It just feels like he’s inconsiderate and lazy. (Oh but I can’t say that because he has a very stressful job and I have to be understanding. Now it’s my turn to roll my eyes.)

I didn’t do anything different today. Kind of kept myself busy with video games, tv shows, work, etc. but that’s been the same thing I’ve done most days anyway. Yet, somehow today was a much better day than I’ve had in a while, and it’s all because of that.

I had a great news, a friend's boss asked for my resume because she is looking for a profile exactly like mine for an even crazier job. (Who wouldn't want to work with rhinos ?)

This funny energetic perky girl texted me, she is coming back in the area this weekend and absolutely wanted to see me again.

I'm enjoying a good brood of coffee on my little ground floor flat's terrace, the lifelong dream bike I bought two month ago is cooling down next to me while I watch the French countryside blooming under the June morning. 

All I have to do today is rewrite my resume to fit the offer.

47,"When I was 14 years old, I made a bucketlist of the things I would like to do before I die. I was an active and full of life teen who have a lot of ambitions and missions in life. 

Fast forward to 8 years. It has been 3 months since I got back to my home country from the US. I thought it was just a short vacation but it seems like I’ll be permanently staying. I was devastated. A lot of things, back to back, have happened that lead to my depression. And in that 3 months, I have been contemplating to end my life.

Three nights ago, I was clearing my room trying to be distracted for a short while. That’s when I stumbled upon my old journal. It was the first time I’ve smiled genuinely in weeks. Reading through the mind of my much positive younger self, I flipped pages and pages until I saw my bucketlist.

And that is when I cried. I have been focusing about all the bad happenings that I am suffering from that I forgot all the awesome things that I have done throughout the years. I let it cloud my mind and change the way how I used to view life. 

I grabbed a pen and highlighted all entries on the list that I was able to accomplish. From simple things like baking a cake to graduating with awards. Cutting my hair short to participating in an outreach program. Visiting my grandmother’s hometown to visiting Grand Canyon.

When I calmed down, I took it all in. I still have a lot to do. I still have a lot to give. Why did I let myself lose to my own negativity? And that’s when I changed my mind. I will not end my life. Not in my own hands. I thought about the things I am looking forward to do and I added it as an entry to my bucketlist since it’s unfinished. I hope that this helps me recover. I’m excited to be back to my old self.",06Jun2019,1346

We met 2 weeks ago and have already spent so much time together. I haven’t met anyone I’ve clicked so well and he is the kindest and sweetest man I’ve known. I’m well aware I am in the honeymoon stage but I think that makes it all the more difficult because I don’t even know how this would have turned out. And I’m so angry and sad that it all happened so close to when I’m leaving. I have two months left, I have work and he has uni so we’re still quite busy and can’t spend an enormous amount of time together.

I’m just trying to treasure it but also so so sad about this.

49,"I'm 14 and pansexual. I live in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is an extremely religious country. People there are too. There, it's still illegal to be attracted to the same sex. My parents and everyone that I know are very homophobic. Dad's a little bit cool with it but mom isn't. I remember the first time I shaved was when I was 13 and mom reacted as if I got a girl pregnant. But dad just said that I looked better shaved and since I haven't shaved even though I look like a hobo had a child with a hippy and that child is me. My friends, they aren't even friends just classmates but everyone says that they're the same thing even though they aren't, are extremely homophobic. There's a feminine guy in our class that's a closeted gay. They bully the absolute hemoglobin out of him. But he actually trusted me so much that he said that I am the only person he has ever came out to. Even though I felt very honoured I also felt very distraught for him that nobody else had a good relationship with him for him to come out to them. I really don't want to be treated like that. Every gay or even feminine guys get called names here. I am willing to bet my life that they will disown me. Dad might not be so harsh but mom's influence on him is greater than his love for my well being. I am just a kid who just wants to be loved. Anything else I can get it by working hard and sheer will. But this is something that I can never influence. They were raised with a mindset that told them that being gay or just feminine is bad. Everyone acts like one of those old west cowboys. But me? I want to care for my body, I want to shave those wretched scraggly hair on my legs and bottom, I want to care for my skin because skincare doesn't make you feminine. If you meet me you'll see I'm not feminine at all. I just like men too that's all. Is that too much to ask? Also, religion plays a massive part in here. People of this country are extremely religious and they fight over the smallest things. If you just tell anybody that you don't believe in God they will come after you with bamboo (they can't afford anything else because their economy is in absolute ruins). They will never use logic and facts in a conversation only religion. Saying that women should never be better than men, they should always be covered head to toe, gays should be executed etc. The country's law is also based on this agenda. So, because of all these things I now hate God and this country from the bottom of heart.

The problem is I'm bored in life and I do think about killing myself because, at least I think that's the reason, for some excitement. I doubt to believe I'm depressed. Yes, I had some mental breakdowns but they were rather not extreme.

We all have grand dreams, we all want to succeed in every single area of life, make ton of money, be rich, famous etc. but how many of us are getting what we want? Think about it for a moment.

People are afraid of trying something new (or taking action) because they think they might fail. And they think if they fail then others will laugh at them. People are afraid of speaking in public, and interacting with other people. Reason? Fear of being judged by other people. People don't feel comfortable expressing their views and opinion. Reason? Fear of conflict. You see how this works?

Here is the truth, at least my truth: all of us can achieve all our dreams. As humans we are all equal. If one person can do it then every other person absolutely can! There is no rocket science to it.

One thing that limits us is fear. Here is some more content that explains what fear is, why we limit ourselves by it, and most importantly how one can overcome it: [https://youtu.be/z6bsLYrMtGM](https://youtu.be/z6bsLYrMtGM)",06Jun2019,2

I have 6 weeks to start and finish my thesis to graduate.
I've also been offered a trial to work at a restaurant for the weekend - if I do well I'd get a full time job. Work is scarce and I don't know when my next opportunity will be.

However I had work experience I was to start today but declined due to the possibility of work - except they aren't waiting for me and need a new person asap, so I might lose my WE at this *really* good place. The WE could help me get a job in the near future, and the place is popular so I'm certaina good word from the owner could land me one.

55,"Two summers ago I got depressed. I was 10-15 pounds heavier than I am now, trying to eat healthy and exercise but not really succeeding. I tried writing my feelings down, didn’t do it consistently. Tried therapy for the first time, didn’t stick with it. I had the ever-present feeling that everyone hated me and had some pretty shitty friends that reinforced that idea. 

After two years of work and support from an ex and my true best friends, I feel better, despite still having my sad moments. I’ve been trying really hard for about a year now to work out consistently, I’ve been more conscious about eating fruits and vegetables, my overall intake of food is less. I do power yoga at least once a week now (yoga has so many health benefits). I went to therapy every week for a year, and I do it less consistently now, but I need it less. I’m on medication that gives me motivation to do tasks I found hard to complete before, like just waking up on time. I’m going to start a journal soon for my thoughts. I’m reading a book.

56,"Hi everyone,

I bought a steel bottle few weeks ago and I'm so glad ! You should buy one as well. You may ask why ?

Well, since I have this bottle, I stay perfectly hydrated all day long. It's also ecological (and cheaper) because I don't buy plastic water bottle no more. When I go to the park or else, I can easily refill my bottle at fountains. (We got a lot of fountains in France). I can put my bottle in my bagpack without water leak fear thanks to the strong screwed cap. ( and not one of these new ecological ""clic-clac"" plastic bottle cap... ). Plus, my skin is brighter than usual, I feel less tired and stressed and  I'm more focused at work and school. :)

Want more ?  I can take more pee breaks than others because everyone knows I drink a lot of water. I can also escape akward situations by going refill my bottle. Anyway, I'm super glad.",06Jun2019,2

60,"I'm busy at work and taking classes on compressed semesters.  Spouse is busy at work and spends every moment of her free time working on her business she started.  Her employees are fucking up and dropping the ball, and I'm trying to find the time to make repairs to our old rental property to sell it.  This morning word comes in that our buyer can't close and is backing out of the contract.  We moved the tenants out to make way for the buyer, so now we're fucked paying 2x mortgage with no rental income, or going through all the additional stress of finding a short-term tenant. We've got 3 kids who are everything good in the world, but also severely limit our flexibility in addressing these things.

We're both pulling our hair out over shared challenges and our own challenges. When one of us shares our stress with the other hoping to be comforted, it just stresses *them* out and makes everything worse. Having your spouse be a stressor rather than a support is a shitty place to be.  Plus, being so stressed makes the little, menial annoyances that you generally don't think much about really stand out, and suddenly the laundry not being done feels like a personal attack.

We're doing fine and our problems are good ones to have.  We are very privileged and very blessed.  We will all eat and wear clean clothes and the bills will be paid, somehow.  I love my wife and I want to be there for her, and I know she wants to be there for me, too.

Is it very common that people can’t go back to what they used to be? Like -- the habit.

I mean, I used to eat less and don’t have the urge to eat more

I can always avoid to intake sugar and starch with no doubt or full of confidence.

I can’t remember how exactly I feel 6-7 years ago,

I was so slim. I was 170cm and 49kgs. 

(but now, I don’t even have the courage to stand on the scale)

I was a part time model during that time.

Slim and pretty. I suppose. hah

Everything changed when I move to a new city to study.

That was an odd choice but well, it is what it is – my choice

I was new there and I know nobody. 

people speak different languages from mine, 

Certainly, I was bored,

I got nothing to do other than study.

Went through the same routine almost every day. 

I was so free during the night time, and

I was too young, not sure how to plan or arrange my time properly. 

I made some friends as well but well, I’m still alone most of the time, because they got their own families. They always have to go back after the class.

I used to be very out-going person in my country but during that time, I have to deal with all the loneliness alone all in a sudden.

I got no one to talk to, because

my mom was sick, she got a serious stroke years ago, 

And she couldn’t remember anything included me, even until now, it has been 10 year from the time she got sick. (she is currently taking care by a helper)  
 my dad got his own life, yea, he found a girlfriend.

And we don’t talk much anymore.

So, all my insecurities of life made me kinda compensate my feelings and boredom to food.

I started to look for a restaurant, sat down and order some food, or went to a grocery and bought all the snacks I’m not willing to eat before. I don’t know why.

The more I tried to avoid before the more I wanted to swallow it.

I’m always over eating, I want to eat until a level that I felt too much, even got a hard time to breath properly sometimes.

Day by day, and month by months.

I know I was confused. I eat, and I gained, but without self-realization. 

I still not sure why would it happens to me until now.

when I went back to my home town, all my friends laugh at me and asked the reason why I’d put out so much weight. They all ask me to get back to normal as soon as possible, because I look prettier last time.

So, I got nervous, I want to lose it all ASAP, well, all the bad cycle , and I knew that I had eating disorder,.

Bulimia Nervosa.

That was tough. I didn’t talk to anyone about this, I kept it by myself…

Until now, even I don’t care about that much anymore, I assume that Im getting better, but the devil in my head will never go away,

The kind of symptom will never leave me. It will always come back again and again…

And im still upset when people told me that… hey…

You seems like put on some weight tho…

Im upset when I look chubby.

I want to look skinny instead of thin

I know im a little bit crazy…

I hate to look at the mirror too sometimes, 

But im sure im better than before 

Well… I always wish t go back to when I was only 49 kgs…

But why is it seem so hard to achieve compared to before…

All I want is not to look fat…

The more I care the worse it get…

Im not comparing myself to others, but, im trying so hard, to control / to make sure myself are staying at the balance points, 

I wonder how can I control myself that well before I moved to the new town.

I try to love myself, like take it as it is.

74,"I was at this park not too far from my house over the weekend, I go here often as a place to walk my dog because that’s the only place he can use the bathroom. There’s usually not a lot of heads at this park so I never worry about anything, after playing with roscoe (my dog) for a little outside in the gated area, I had to use the bathroom so I tied his leash around the bike rack by the little resting area with bathrooms. I saw a guy that was with his friends playing on the other side of the field start walking towards me but he was too far to hold the bathroom door open without it being weird. so I got in the stall and started to piss. I hear the door open and it sounds like he’s just going for a piss in the urinal but then he knocks on my stall door. he asked if I could hurry up even though there were two other stalls in the (empty) bathroom. I didn’t know if he was messing or being serious so I kind of just laughed and pointed towards the other stalls with my feet so he could see. he ripped off my sandals from my feet when giving him directions and this sent me into a furious rage. I didn’t even think about pulling up my pants or even unlocking the stall door. I ran right through it and started chasing this guy down but before I could even step out of the bathroom this guy puts me in a chokehold and bashes my head into the fucking paper towel dispenser. I told him he’d probably have to pay for that but before I could finish he kicked me in the ribs several times and ran out of the bathroom. it took me a few minutes to get to my feet, I just left the blood all over the bathroom floor for evidence, and when I walked outside my dog was gone",06Jun2019,1
75,"So my GF (18) and I always practice safe sex (I always wear a condom and pull out). She is not on any BC however. She typically gets her period 2-3 days early and as of right now she is 3 days late. I'm shitting bricks and she's out of state for the week so a pregnancy test isn't an option right now. I was just wondering, from personal experience do you guys think this is something I should worry about. The main thing on my mind is the fact that her periods are always early compared to most girls, this is what is causing me to think so much of it. **I guess my main questions are, From what I described do you guys think she could be pregnant? also is it normal for someone who is always 2-3 days early to be this late?**

TLDR: My GF and I are always safe in bed ( I wear a condom and pull out) but she is 3 days late on her period and is normally early. Is it normal for someone who is typically early to have a period this late.",06Jun2019,1
76," 

Sitting in the plush chair recovering, my mind cleared a bit and I began to think about where I was and what to do next. As I did, a powerful energy began to build inside me. I somehow knew exactly what to do. But before I made a move, I took another minute to compose myself. I sat back comfortably in the chair, my feet wide on the front edge of the ottoman, my knees bent and draped lazily apart. I was in a seemingly vulnerable position but felt immensely powerful. After a period of quiet, I shifted my gaze to him and said firmly “please get my shoes”. 

He returned with them and somehow knew to kneel next the ottoman. I lowered my right knee to extend my foot off of the edge of the ottoman, my other leg still bent and relaxed, laying carelessly open to the side. A simple nod was all the instruction he needed. Slowly, and with the same care and attention he afforded my more intimate areas earlier, he gently slid my foot into the blue stiletto and tightened the straps. With the first foot in place, I raised that knee and let it fall to the side as he maneuvered to my other side to repeat the process on my left foot. As he stood up wondering what my next instruction might be, I glanced across the room to the head-on full length mirror and admired what I saw. My feet and knees apart, my long legs made longer by my impossibly sexy shoes, an unobstructed view of my very clean, very sexy private area and a commanding expression on my face that let you know exactly who was in charge now.

I told him to pull out the low stool from beneath the make-up vanity and place it in front of the full length mirror. He complied. While locking eyes with him, I lowered one stiletto at a time to the floor, stood, and strutted to the stool. I told him to stand in front of me with the stool between us. The mirror was to my right. I then took a step forward and sat down, spreading my knees wide to accommodate the close quarters. The low stool and my high heels pushed my knees high. I had a very good view of his belt buckle. Without looking up, I said firmly “please remove your clothes…all of them”. 

There was a pause. His body language then betrayed that he would now acquiescence to my inspection. He smoothly slipped off his shirt. He was fit, a swimmer with strong shoulders. It occurred me he must be a serious swimmer because his chest and arms were clean shaven. He then handily unclasped his belt and slid his pants and underwear down together. Not a hair anywhere. Given my proximity, the motion of sliding down his pants brought me a generous dose of his essence. It was an intoxicating blend of clean smelling body wash and the unmistakable musk of an aroused adult male. 

With my knees far apart, in what was now my “power position”, I raised my hand and cupped his lower parts gently in my hand. His soft moan of gratitude coincided with an involuntary twitch above. He was thick. As I gently fondled his hairless lower portion he began to take shape. With my other hand I helped stretch him out to get a more thorough assessment. He was magnificent. My lower section was heating up quickly and I could feel wetness on the stool. A glance up to his eyes revealed a powerful storm brewing. As my eyes returned downward, his thick upper portion began to reach full size. As it did, it took on the menacing look of violent criminal waking up from his prison bed, not at all amused by the disturbance. This was a burly convict that took what he wanted. Period. No remorse. 

In an effort to hold on to my waning dominance I said to him “I need to see your full size, stroke it for me”. With my hand still gently cuddling his hairless lower section, he complied. Mere inches from my face he began slowing stroking himself as his surly partner got more energized. As it reached its full potential his strokes became more rhythmic. Not inches from my face he stroked it vigorously, accelerating the strokes in tandem with his increasingly labored breathing. Before it was too late, he paused. He then squeezed it hard and with one more slow stroke produced a single clear drop at its end. While still fondling his lower section, I dragged my warm tongue along the bottom side starting from the base until I claimed the reward at the end, tasting him for the first time. Another groan of gratitude. I lowered his heavy tip onto my tongue and began to massage the underside of it with my tongue. Opening wider, I slid myself onto him. With one hand down below and one on his shaft, I opened my mouth wide and took him as far as I could. Squeezing the base of his shaft and his lower section gently, I worked him in deeper with each attempt. His groans were intoxicating and I wanted more of him. I took my hand off of his shaft and reached through his legs and spread my hand across his muscular, hairless read end and pulled him toward me. With my mouth wide, my throat struggling and my eyes watering I pulled every inch of him into me that I could. 

Neither of us wanted this to end quickly. So, we gently back away. 

Without a word, I stood up on my stilettos and lead him back to the living room. A silent sip of our drinks, no words spoken. Onward.

The living room was trendy with low leather couches, hi-tech lamps and minimalist artwork. There was a large leather-top coffee table, also low, in front of the couch and in front of the large glass windows overlooking Washington. With nothing on but my heels, my heat and my swagger I lead him directly to the windows. I told him to stand facing out. Anyone looking our way could not miss this naked erect man doing what he was told. After sufficient public exposure, I had him sit on one corner of the low coffee table with his legs strewn onto the floor towards the windows. I laid him back and put his hands over his head. I whispered in no uncertain terms that he was to keep his hands where I had put them. 

I turned my back to him and took another glance at the Washington skyline. I felt eyes on me, from somewhere. I liked it. Facing the window, I stepped across his body with one blue stiletto now on either side of his thighs and began to lower myself down. I briefly wondered if even in my advanced state of arousal I could take this large man. Since the table was low I had to squat down quite far before I could hold his thick friend to my clean shaven, slippery place. I lowered myself onto him in pulses, adding more weight with each timid attempt. I didn’t make much progress at first but slowly began to relax and feel myself open up. I was becoming so wet that I could feel with my hand his shaft become soaked (thought it hadn’t yet be inside me). As I relaxed I began to make more progress. His thick, punishing friend was over halfway in. I gradually felt the nervous, tense, stretching sensation give way to a very full feeling with electric tingles of pleasure emanating from the area. After an enjoyable series of wincing, erotic pulses, I slid all the way down. His full complement was inside me. When I realized I was all the way down I slowly relaxed my legs and enjoyed the relief of being in a resting position. Still adjusting to the very large addition inside me, I sat perfectly still for several minutes. In that quiet time, I felt my inner muscles fully accept him. As I became increasingly comfortable, a feeling of calm enveloped me. I was now peacefully enjoying the view of Washington with this large man deeply inside of me.

No longer anxious about the physical challenge of the situation, my attention returned to my arousal. I began to slowly shift my weight, almost imperceptibly. Changes in pressure from my small rocking motion were amplified by his size into larger changes of pressure inside me. In contrast to the quiet calm created by the minutes spent totally motionless, these small movements and feelings inside me were becoming vivid and wonderful. I gradually increased the magnitude and speed of my motions, ramping things up only as far as my pleasure tolerance would allow. As my activity level increased, I introduced my hand to area which took things to yet another level. In the fog of my arousal, I almost lost track of the fact there was another human being present. He was behind me and mostly out of sight. I didn’t care. I increased my pace now rocking myself strongly with my hand in synchronous motion. I felt the familiar wave coming so I slowed things down. In fact, I focused on relaxing every muscle in my body. Rather than encourage the wave to crash violently I instead remained almost totally still, to patiently let the wave come to me. It did. With only trace motions of my hand and a zen, laser focus on the thick rocking horse inside me the wave smoothly approached and then totally enveloped me with a warm, peaceful but very powerful full body orgasm. And it kept coming. As I quaked and lost focus on remaining still, the resulting involuntary motion kept the waves of pleasure coming, and coming! I was now such a wet mess that I’d made the whole area into a wet mess. This was magnificent! 

I eventually slowed myself for some desperately needed recovery. And, in that sobriety, remembered that the man below me had orders to keep his hands to himself. This couldn’t go on indefinitely. As he sensed me quiet down he gently put his hands on my waist, seeking non-verbal acknowledgement that this chapter had concluded. I put my hands on his giving him the assurance that it was OK to use his hands again. After we sat there another minute in silence he decided that it was time for his reward.

With his strong hands he gently raised me up off of his still raging menace. As I rolled to the side to join him on the leather coffee table it occurred to me that only one of us had just had powerful relief. His entire body remained rigid with sexual tension. With me safely landed on the table he moved to a kneeling position and, making no eye contact and without speaking, moved me brusquely into the position he wanted. There was urgency and absolutely no negotiation or permission sought. He put me on all fours with my face to the window. He moved my knees apart to adjust my height. He then placed one hand in the middle of my back and pressed me downward until my face touched the leather. He moved both of my hands behind my back and held them firmly together. My rear end was up and on display, totally accessible to him. Then, with my face helplessly planted into the leather, he raised is rigid manhood and approached me from behind. 

No warning, no apologies. He slammed his thick manhood all the way back in. I felt my body shudder as he crashed his hips into me burying himself to the bottom setting off an explosion of pleasure. The electric jolt of him bottoming out was new to me, and very good. He began pounding me mercilessly. As I started to become lost in the pulses of pleasure, it occurred to me why he had so carefully adjusted my height. He did this so that he could be above me and then drive himself downward into me. From our earlier fun, he remembered where my favorite spot was and this position gave him the angle he needed for perfect access. He drove himself violently at that spot again and again and again and again. God this guy knew what he was doing. I began to feel the boiling point approaching and he showed zero signs of relenting. Just as I thought I couldn’t be more aroused, he used his thumb and my abundant local lubricant to massage my anus as the pounding continued. 

I immediately exploded! Absolutely fucking exploded screaming unintelligible primal sounds as he pounded that spot and exploded my brain with the actions of this slippery thumb. I was drooling on the leather, grunting through my wet hair now partly in my mouth and in my eyes. I was powerless and loving it, more please more please more please. Mother Fucker!

As he sensed I could take little more of this, he withdrew himself and rolled me over. Then, he kneeled straddling me with one knee on each side of my tummy. He was standing straight up on his knees looking forward giving me a close-up, magnificent view of his strong hand and its enormous glistening contents. I watched his facial expressions as he furiously worked himself to a granite-hard point of no return. He grimaced as his pace increased. I felt it first in his thigh muscles as his body began to spasm. I then saw his eyes become unfocused and roll back slightly. His torso began to falter as he struggled to remain upright. He let out a deep primal growl and began to erupt. As he did I strained my abdominals in an attempt to sit up and get an even closer look. He exploded in a cacophony of messy noise and action with me totally immersed in the crossfire. This is so FUCKIN HOT! 

Once the fireworks subsided, I collapsed back onto the leather. Like a redwood tree that had been cut, he felled somewhere out of my view. Breathless. Speechless. Disoriented. Exhausted.

78,"I don't know where to post this because I can't identify the place where this should be, so I thought this might be the most appropriate place. 

I don't know how to explain this, but I really can't help singing or ""playing"" things as if they were drums (i.e. When I'm studying I hit literally everything with my pen and I play the rhythm I feel in my veins). I am a bit shy so at university or when I'm with my friends I don't sing, but instead I only beat tables, my body etc to create a rhythm. 

When I am not singing nor playing I feel like I'm tied and I feel very frustrated. My family finds very annoying this trait of my personality (I don't even know if I can describe this in this way) , but when I sing or play I feel free and this makes me happy. 


I feel like I am a bit strange because of this thing, but actually I'd like to sing even when I am not in my comfort zone because I think in this way I could deeply express myself. 


Have you ever felt like that? I'm curious.",06Jun2019,1
79,"Okay okay before everyone scrambles for their keyboards let me just get out of the way I am NOT nor have ever been an incel, and I don’t support the incel community in any way. I don’t care much for incel misogyny, but I also REALLY don’t care for the bullying and toxicity I believe r/inceltears is dedicated to, so that’s why I’m writing this.

/r/inceltears (or IT) is reddit’s largest anti-incel sub, and is dedicated to showcasing the worst of incels the users can find. I get why IT exists in the way it does. I have no doubt most of its users think they’re “fighting the good fight” and we all, whether consciously or otherwise, have a dark part of us that likes to make fun of others and punch down. That’s something I can understand and relate to. However, who IT targets is especially dangerous that actually ends up hurting both sides.

So it’s pretty obvious most incels are mentally ill in some way, and their dogma is an excellent representation of that. It’s not a bold claim to say the majority of incels are people with trauma, in crisis, or are just really sick. This doesn’t excuse them from the things the group has said and done, but I think we can all agree that they are in desperate need of help. Fortunately, there’s no better way of doing that than reddit due to its anonymous features Even though incels are infamously resistant to help, if reddit provided a more comfortable place for them to reach out, I think we can help a surprising number of incels change for the better.

But instead, with the mean-spirited nature that unfortunately drives most of Reddit, we have decided to put all our energy on uselessly belittling them. A quick look shows that most of IT really doesn’t care at all with helping to alleviate the incel problem, but instead to use as an easy and cheap way to feel better about themselves and having something to be angry about. I know this because… well, many moons ago, I did the exact same thing on IT. I know how subs like IT work. And sadly, all that IT really ends up accomplishing is having incels feel like the outside world is hostile, and they forever stay in their toxic echo-chambers where they are further radicalized.

I also believe IT is hurting its own users. In my light research I think I found a quote from /u/MasterGrok
that best describes the predicament:

”Any group that exists entirely to make fun of, bring down, or point out the shortcomings of another group is naturally toxic. It just brings out the worse in inward/outward tribal behaviors. It doesn't matter if you are on the right side of the issue or not. And I don't mean just toxic to others. I mean toxic to you. Spending your time making fun of other people (again, even if you are on the right side of the issue) is not good medicine for the soul. In the end you are still just surrounding yourself with criticism and negativity.”

And to add on to this, when you constantly surround yourself with the incel dogma for long enough, even just to make fun of it, you can start to have some of its messages leak into your subconscious without realizing it until it’s too late. Whatever you create for your environment your brain will accept it as the truth. So, at the end of the day, all IT accomplishes is having both parties worse off than they were before.

I think as time moves on and it becomes more accessible and socially tolerable for men to seek out mental help or just discuss their problems in general, we’ll see the incel problem decrease on its own. I also believe as toxic standards for men further dissipate (seriously, what are we teaching our boys when so many value their self-worth to be entirely based on their virginity? Does nobody see how truly disgusting that is?) the incel problem will become less dire as well.

I believe incels are like the way they are because of the bullying that's happened through their life, and I don't believe continuing that online will simply do any good. I’m not going to act like I know exactly how to fix the incel problem, because I don’t. However, I know IT is definitely not the solution.

81,"Hello people of r/self I would like to share my story and I couldn't think of a better place to do it then here. 

It all started at the start of this schoolyear. There was a new girl at school. I saw her walking down the hall and I tought she looked absolutely beautiful but you know of course I didn't think she would be into me so I just left it alone. Later that year when we had exams all the kids in my school get assigned a random classroom to go sit and do their exams. The girl was in the same classroom as me and there were also a couple of my friends in the same classroom. So then I finally told my friends how I thought this girl was so beautiful. I told them she was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen. And they all told me that they also thought she was beautiful. 

So a Little time passed again and I saw her almost everyday at school. We would always make a lot of eyecontact but none of us ever made a move to talk to each other. And I also learned about the fact that she was a couple of grades lower than me and since I'm older then 18 years old I tought I might take it easy just to keep it ethical. I started to become really into her and I tought I might send her a friend request on facebook. So after thinking about it I sent her one and she accepted it. a week later there was a little festival kindoff thing in my hometown I went to and I saw her there. Me and my friends were standing at the mainstage in the crowd and she and her friends came to the mainstage as well and were standing behind us. And again we were making a lot of eyecontact. Later that day when I was in the moshpit she was also in the moshpit and we moshed together. But we never said a word to each other. 

Later that night I was walking around the festival on my own and all of the sudden I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turn around and what do you know It's the girl. It was to tell me that she lost her phone and if I found it I should come and tell her. So I said fine if I see it I'll tell you. so for a little while I was at the mainstage and I was thinking about our conversation as I always do because I'm insecure. I tought she should post something on the facebook page of the event about her phone so that if anyone found it they could tell her. but I tought I'll never find her here again so I won't be able to tell her. So I walked over to a couple of my friends and when I got to them I saw the girl standing a little further. So I walked over to her and told her about the the facebook page thing. 

Again a little later that nigh I was at the afterparty but she wasn't there. I look at my phone and I see I have a text from her telling me I don't have to look for her phone anymore because it got stolen. I was very happy when I saw she texted me eventhough it was just about her phone. so I answered the text and we just kept texting from that point. So we texted each other over the weekend about the festival and stuff. So on monday when I went to school I felt really nervous because I would see her again and I didn't know if I should talk to her or not so I ran into her in the hall but we were going opposite ways so she smiled at me and I smiled back and that was it. I remember seeing her smile and thinking it was beautiful and I was very happy that day. 

So this went on for about 2 weeks. We texted each other but never talked in person. I was telling my freinds about it and they read the texts and they all told me they tought she was into me to. One day my friends all told me to ask her out on a date. I was very nervous but I finally gathered enough courage to do it. I asked to go to the movies someday and that's where everything went wrong. She told me she had a boyfriend and wouldn't want to go out because the final exams were coming up. I was so sad about that because she gave me hope and in some way I was sure she was into me because of the way she texted me. The fact that she had a boyfriend came as a shock to me. I told my friends what happened and none of them could believe she had a boyfriend. and to this day I still think she was making it up because I have never ever seen her boyfriend.

When she said no to the date I tought well this is it I'll never talk to or text her again. But I was wrong. Later that night she texted me again and I couldn't believe it. She was still texting as if nothing ever happened. That made me really happy. but then the next I didnt hear from her anymore. I tought let's just leave it alone for today maybe she'll text me tomorrow. I tought I shouldn't text her because what if she actually had a boyfreind and he found out about me. I didn't want him to get mad at me. 

So a couple of days passed. When I saw her at school she didn't smile at me anymore. So I got pretty sad for a little while. But then all of the sudden out of nowhere she texts me: How are you? So I told here I was fine and about 2 texts later she said: I should get back to work. So I thought this was pretty weird but it made me really happy. I now knew that she was still thinking about me. and it felt like she cared about me but then a couple of days passed again and she didn't text me again.

Then at school I was in the same class as her because I needed to finish something in that class so that  was really awkward in the beginning. but for the first time in a week she smiled at me again. So I smiled back and that was about the point that I got really opsessed with her. In the following weekend I went to the city becuase she lived there and I thought I might run in to her. I was disgusted at the fact I wanted to do something like that but I couldn't stop myself. When I was in the city I ofcourse didn't run in to her because the chances of that were very slim. When I got home I was really sad because I didn't see her. and I thought to myself this isn't healthy behavior I have to stop this. But I just found myself doing stuff like that again and again. There was a spot in school she would always sit with her friends. And I would always sit in a spot so I could see her sitting there. I also started to memorize here class schedule. This wasn't for any reason I never did anything with that information but I just memorized it.

And now I still am in love with her and I wish somthing could happen between us but it probably never will so I'm trying to get over her but it's very hard and seeing her in school everyday doesn't help because everytime I see here I just think she's the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. I have had girlfriends and been in love with a couple of girls before but I never felt anything like this for anybody before.

thanks if you read through the whole thing I just really wanted to shere this with someone.",06Jun2019,2

It sucks cause I don’t know if it’s like... a budding eating disorder (I could see it.)

90,"I had a long distance relationship with someone and it ended badly. He’d always accuse me of not caring enough etc. I admit due to my struggle with depression I may seem distant. He had depression as well which I thought he’d be understanding. He would listen to my explanations but would still insist I should change myself for him because it looks like I don’t care.

I admit I had my doubts for the relationship due to there being no end goal and i tried to end it earlier but I realized I loved him so I decided I would do my best to keep it together despite how hard the distance is. 

It ended due to a petty argument. I was frustrated he’d been absent ish for a week barely getting back to me and replying directly to messages where I asked him questions so I sent him a frustrated text. He shot back saying he did everything for me when I did nothing and removed me from all social media.

I never intended to break up with him. I assumed he wanted to breakup with me beforehand since he would say so much stuff about how I was hurting him and not caring enough. I tried my best to show him that I cared by sending frequent messages etc and that week I did that so it really hurt when I was trying my best to show him and he barely got back to me when I knew he was on his phone.


Anyhow, afterwords I said some mean things saying he didn’t deserve me and deserved nothing from me. I was tired of being a doormat and always saying sorry when he didn’t even believe my apologies. I admit I removed him from social media platforms before since I thought he wanted to break up with me. Moreover, I know I assumed too many things due to my insecurities and I tried to explain to him it wasn’t him just myself but he didn’t really want to understand which I can get. 

I can’t apologize for what I said obviously since I told him he’d never hear from me again and also I don’t want to hold him back anymore by being in this dead end relationship. However despite realizing my mistakes on my end it’s tough to forgive myself. I acknowledge everything even trying to explain myself and why I did do things but obviously I never received a sorry from him for all the accusations and even being yelled at while he used his suicidal thoughts to guilt me saying I didn’t care enough to ask him how he was.

I admit I am a bit distant sometimes since being super caring over long distance is really difficult to do. 

Somedays I’m really great with moving past this stuff just realizing that the distance just put a big strain on all this and his lifestyle of destruction is literally not mine. However, I miss him and I feel awful for how I’ve acted.. then again I can’t return to a relationship when I felt like I was walking on eggshells for mentioning something that bothered me. Or being implied that I was self centered for talking about that—I didn’t even argue with that either I just apologized since I felt bad he felt that way.

I don’t know how to forgive myself. He’s probably over there in Boston literally not giving a shit and probably convinced that everything is 100% my fault so he doesn’t have any guilt or any feelings whatsoever lmao.",06Jun2019,2

It's soul-crushing really, I am a social person, but the way I slow down around people makes it impossible for me to live by my nature. Where's the point then.",06Jun2019,1

95,"If I didn't have enough reason to believe this till now, today I got reminded of it all again.


I happen to be a student, studying for a medical degree. I just had a practical exam today and missed one pretty common diagnosis that i considered to be something else. It wasn't anything complicated, even though i did think of that option, i never really reached a conclusion about it. It was just one in a list of options, but i didn't think it was my best shot. I will spare you the details, but a missed diagnosis of this kind could be fatal. Ironically enough, i answered the more difficult questions without a problem.


That's one of the reasons i've always felt medicine isn't for me. I have multiple options in my mind and can't stick with only one. So when i'm presented with a strict requirement like a diagnosis, i can't seem to make it properly. There are so many things to be considered and noticed that i can't select what's needed and what's not. Which seems to be crucial in medicine. But when the diagnosis is completely clear with nothing suspicious or possibly overlapping with who knows, it's going to be boring. If i ever actually end up working with patients, I'd probably be that weird doctor that would suspect cancer on every patient with rather unalarming symptoms and perform costly tests only to see that person is completely healthy. Luckily, i'll never work as a doctor.


I've been told that i'm too desperate about not making mistakes. But i don't think that's true. The kind of mistake i did today could have cost a person's life. I see my shortcomings and i don't want them to have a negative impact on other people, especially in a doctor-patient relationship. The consequences of mistakes are extremely obvious in this field. Yeah, certain patients are going to die anyway, but as a doctor, you should know you did your best for them. Call me naive.


I happen to be in the top 15-25% of my year according to my grades, so i guess you could say i do better than a lot of people. But I know that doesn't mean a thing. I am actually terrified at how many students are incompetent and superficial. The worst part is that most of them aren't even aware of it.


I'm not even seeking perfection. What is that, anyways? I know that a more abstract field would be more suited to my needs, though. My mind seems to go for the unusual, unseen before things. Toying with ideas, sharpening my skills in something abstract and new where nothing and no one could get harmed. Many things seem to lose part of their appeal once they're repetitive or have tons of real life implications.",06Jun2019,2
96,"You might be thinking ""that's not that bad, guys download porn all the time"" 

Well 

The thing is, I upgraded from an iPhone to a Samsung about two years ago and since that time the old phone has been collecting dust in the family safe 

Now, it can not be my porn since I would never download it (seems a bit excessive personally) so that just leaves my family 

Younger brother; he is the right age although I doubt he would leave the phone open without a password 

Older sister; never really got vibes from her of being in the closet, then again her only friends are other girls 

Mother; widowed for almost a decade but I honestly dont think it was her 

So, since I cant figure out who the porn belongs to I wont raise the topic and will keep the secret hidden

98,"Today my coworker sent me a message. She didn't want to work with me anymore. To give some backstory, I've been working as a teacher teaching kids Circus. I've been teaching them juggling discplines for about two years. I love the kids, they are some of the most awesome kids around. My coworker on the other hand was doing Aerial acrobatics, stretching etc. The first month  of working was a good time and after a while it became pretty different, she started being late for almost every lesson and I usually had to start the warm-up before she arrived. The first year went pretty well, but unfortnately she started annoying me more and more. After the summer she was in a different country the first 4 weeks of the semester so I had to find her a substitute teacher every week, and I felt like she was not really invested in her work. (She would still turn up late to  work when she got back) Throughout the next year I was demotivated and not really enjoying the work. I loved the kids, and everytime I had a lesson I did my work as best as I could. Still I would make up excuses to myself, instead of doing the responsibilities my work had assigned me to do outside of the teaching, and do stuff in the last minute.   
The last month of the semester, my coworker had become more invested and I was not as invested as I probably should have. I've basically become what my coworker was at the start of the semester. As of now the semester has ended and the teaching will start after summer.

  
The last month I avoided answering her and texting her back about different question about work. I did the work I was supposed to do, but it just did it a little bit late compaired to what I should have. She sent me a message the last week about how she found me unprofessional, and how I didn't do the responsibilities I was assigned to do. I didn't answer, I didn't want to deal with it I guess. I already told my boss that I was contemplating quitting my job two weeks ago anyways.

I'm not sure why I didn't just do the work faster instead of waiting for the last minute. I've been working as a substitute teacher the last 4 months as well, and I've always done what I had to do as soon as possible instead of delaying it. I've never had an experience like this before, it doesn't feel like what I would have done. After thinking about this for quite sometime I have found out that the work I did at my (now) old job wasn't the work I really wanted to do, just because me and my coworker wasn't on the same wave length. I could have probably done things differently and the situation would have been different. Because of this one text message I feel like I've learned a lot about myself. Especiallythat I need to communicate better and find work where I have professional motivating people around me and not make it the coworker relationship personal.  I never thought just one text message could change so much of my of perspective.  


If you're wondering, I answered her text telling I've talked to our boss about quitting already.",06Jun2019,1
99,"This morning I dreamt about a boat which was lifted out of the water because its passengers were dead.  It really shook me during the dream, but I didn't think much of it until I learned that a sightseeing boat crashed and sunk last week in Budapest and only 7 out of 33 people are known to have survived.

101,"I’m 20 year old male and in college right now, about to enter my final year in August. For the past 6 years since moving from a different state, I’ve been very depressed and frequently had suicidal thoughts. I constantly thought I deserved to be alone and have no friends or relationships whatsoever because I felt worthless. I constantly hoped people would bully me and put me down because I thought that’s what I deserved and I was very thin because I was uninterested in eating. You would have never known I was going through this from looking at me because I come off (and I truly am) genuine and easy going, but it persisted for so long and it was something I dealt with on my own.

after silently struggling for 4.5 years I made my big breakthrough and personal growth this past year and a half and found worth within myself. I am now in a much better place mentally and physically. I have never been in a relationship before but now I feel like I deserve to be in one. It’s a very liberating feeling and I really wanted to share that with you! While I will definitely be nervous to ask someone out, it’s more of excitement.

103,"My big brother died in an avalanche a few months ago at the start of my last semester of college. It was shattering. He was everything I wanted to be- a shining model for how I wanted to live my life. I miss him every second. I pushed all my grief down and somehow, by way of miracle, graduated a few weeks ago. I decided to take a solo road trip to spend some time by myself and work through all the grief and myriad emotions I had to shove down to graduate. And it has been incredible. 
I’m an anxious person- I have PTSD from a pretty brutal sexual assault in college, and I’m by nature rather cautious. This trip has been life changing. I feel confident in myself. I’m making bold decisions and doing what I want and consciously choosing not to let fear or apprehension stop me. I’m having the time of my life. I really feel like my brother would be proud of me- something that’s making me cry as I write it. I love this. I’m PROUD of myself.

104,"Throwaway for privacy reasons and will attempt to not ramble on...

&amp;#x200B;

I met a girl through a random online chat room app at a pretty rough time in my life. She was really cool, liked the same music, very sweet etc... we ended up exchanging Kik contact info (speaks to how long ago this was....lol) and kept in touch through Kik from end of 2012ish until mid 2015 which was the last time I heard from her - through text. I thought about her today and figured I would download the app and see if she kept it and would get the message, etc. Turns out that is not the case. I have a phone number that I texted her on a few times back in 2015 before we fell out of touch but when I attempted to call it today, I got a message saying the owner of the number has changed their number, this # is no longer in service etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a photo of her, her and her sister's name (very common names, last name is Garcia, not saying first names for privacy reasons), where she is from and there's really no other identifiable info that I could use to search for her on social media. I'm going to attempt reverse image searching the photo and see what happens but she helped me through a hard time in my life and I'd really just like the chance to speak with her again. Any tips on how I could potentially find her?",06Jun2019,2
106,"I was wondering why I feel so lonely, have low self esteem and can't get close with any friends school or with my family at home. I realize that I have very weird thoughts and behaviors and might subconsciously be contributing to my low self esteem.

Even at a young age I had weird behaviors. Take for instance when I was in pre-k, I got in trouble for touching another dude's penis during recess times. In fifth grade, I was attracted to my teacher. I masturbate and I have attractions towards an underage girl that goes to my church. Overall, I feel like I am a very weird person. 

I am ashamed of these thoughts that I have and I knew obviously that they are bad so I'd never act on them since I would be hurting people if I did. I also feel ashamed of masturbating and I've been trying to stop myself from doing it and it's been a real struggle, I have never stopped doing it for more than a month. I've never really had many friends in high school or middle school and I don't know how to socialize. I'm a senior at high school and I struggle with loneliness and social anxiety. I do have interests like playing videogames and playing guitar but I can never seem to connect to anyone or be happy around people. I think maybe these thoughts are what defines me as a person which is why I have so much trouble making friends because maybe I'm afraid that my true self will be discovered? Then again maybe it's because of my social anxiety? I just want to be able to be more comfortable around people instead of closing myself off all the time.",06Jun2019,2

I saw a cat sitting in someone's room that had floor to ceiling windows, and it was like something out of a movie. The walk reminded me of when I went hiking in Puerto Rico with my sister. I just finished visiting her and her 4 month old baby, and I love and miss them both dearly.

110,"There's a local, family owned diner (hole in wall type place) that I and my mom occasionally goes. My mom is in her 60s and she loves to talk with the waitress who works there, a 22 yo girl who is super magnetic and friendly, and comes across as one of the most sincere/kind people I've ever met, even though I've barely spoked to her the few times I go to this cafe with my mom. 

High on success after working my first day at my new job today, I and my mom went to celebrate at said diner. Near the end of the meal, waitress ( a very attractive girl I should add) starts hitting on me and I get fairly flustered, to say the least. She touched my arm at least twice and we seem to be hitting it off fairly well. 

She mentions that she 'gives financial advice' for a couple hours a week and gets paid several hundred dollars for it. To her credit, she is upfront about the fact you have to pay $90 for each licensee/license (not sure which it was). The fact you had to pay to make money set off huge alarm bells in my head (I read all about MLM's but never thought it'd happen to me), but I was still excited and grateful she was letting me in on such a job. 

To top it all off, she gives me her phone and tells me to put my name/number in ( she wasn't pushy or forceful at all, to her credit again). Not gonna lie, my stupid ass brain thought she was actually dtf. 

She said you didn't need a degree or any qualifications at all, but just had to through training. 

Then she brings up her fiancee near the end, fully deflating me, to say the least. 

However she said she'd text me next week at a certain time to explain the job to me. The fact that she (and not her company) would talk me through seems super suspect. 

I feel like she insulted me indirect by thinking I'd be stupid enough to fall for a MLM and top of that, she tried to manipulate me sexually ( god I feel like such an incel for even typing that out, sorry, but its literally what happened so I can't sugar-coat the facts). 

My mom seems to be SUPER good friends with the girl though, so I think I probably shouldn't mention any this to her. My mom needs as many friends as she could get, so I wouldn't want to leave a bitter taste in her mouth about this girl. 

I guess I just feel super betrayed/insulted. Somebody who seemed like such a good person went out of their way to take advantage of my nativity. 

**TLDR; But yeah, I guess my question is, what should I do? I think I'll just politely tell her I'm no longer interested, and then block her if she continues pressuring me about it. I'll keep my mom out of it completely and let her continue to enjoy her friendship with this girl. Right move?**",06Jun2019,3
111,"So I'm constantly stressed from school and my sophomore year of highschool was the worst year of my life. Many days I cried at night thinking about school work and if I will make it in life. When I saw the school buildings my heart dropped and I just don't want the next day to come. I cried once in front of my brother and he kept telling me to tell him what's wrong. I didn't want to but he insisted that it will make me feel better. 

I ended up telling him but ofc he tells me things will get better or try to power through it. I felt so much worse after telling him because I'm just reminded of what I'm going to see the next day. 

At this point, I realized I rather forget about my troubles and stress rather than talking about it with someone. It keeps my mind off of my troubles. Doing something other than thinking about it made me feel better. But my brother sees it as I'm avoiding the issue. I'm not. I just want to deal with it once I feel better. I hate it when someone asks me what's wrong.
