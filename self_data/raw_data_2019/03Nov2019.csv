0,"I'm all about how good something sounds. And just for reference here, I'm not talking about the music I listen to, I'm talking about the music I **make.** I don't write my own songs or anything (or at least haven't *yet*), but I do like to cover my favorite songs (acoustically) and post them on my SoundCloud (it's mostly alternative 2000's/pop punk songs). 

I'm a perfectionist when it comes to recording, so if it doesn't sound perfect, I'm not satisfied. Problem is, sometimes no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to get the write sound. But that's not even the main problem. The main problem is my voice. I just wish I could sing and actually sound **good.** I'm not the *worst* singer, but my voice definitely isn't a talent of mine. Maybe the fact that I can sing *and* play the guitar is (kind of?) a talent, but my voice alone is certainly nothing special. It's just sometimes I can't hit certain notes or my voice cracks and when I listen back to it I slightly cringe hearing the sound of my own voice failing to hit the right notes or time it right with the song I am playing.

What it all comes down to though is the final product. How does the final, mixed down, rendered, completed audio sound? Well, that's what's driving me to write this post. I think I do well at recording and mixing and stuff but once I upload it to SoundCloud and play it back, I listen and just wish it could be better somehow. I'm not sure why, again, maybe it's my voice. But I really don't know.

Just wanted to write down my thoughts here and get this off my chest. Thanks for reading!",03Nov2019,2
1,"I don't even know why I am typing this but I have no one else so I guess I will talk to internet strangers. 

I've dealt with health issues all my life but the past 4 years have been hell. I've been to the ER 45+ times, 13 of those were transports by ambulance, had over 40 surgical procedures of some sort, seen 150+ doctors in 3 states and still can't get any answers. I take about 25 pills a day. I am on anti-depressants and was talking to someone but insurance wouldn't cover it and with no money, I couldn't continue. EVeryone talks about asking for help and you'll get it but that is a bunch of bullshit. No one cares that I've had to share some of my dogs food just to get something in my stomach so I didnt throw up my pills. No one cares I have no one to talk to. No one fucking cares. I even went to Mayo Clinic and the doctors told me that life would be incredibly difficult for me going forward. I chose not to believe them at first, but now I think they are right. Maybe fighting isn't worth it anymore. 

I'm 31 and have been single for 12 years. I haven't been to a movie theater in 6 years, haven't been out to actually eat a restaurant in 4 years, and even though I love skiing and winter, have not been to the mountains in who knows how long. My last vacation was 9 years ago. I really thought things would be different. I thought I would've been married now and maybe even have a family. Instead, I've spent every dime I had ($60k+) on medical bills, traveling to other states for medical help and just trying to survive. I am on medical leave from job but it is unpaid. And I don't qualify for disability or food stamps because I still technically have a job so I'm often stuck with eating a piece of bread for dinner. Most of my family and friends quit talking to me and the few ( no more than 3 people) that still do live two states away or more. My credit is shot, bill collectors call non-stop and I'm getting close to being evicted. At what point is all that shit just not worth it anymore? People tell me to fight but they don't know how hard this is. If I died at home tonight, it would take days or even a week for anyone to even notice I was gone. It would probably be someone complaining about the smell before anyone noticed I was gone. No one cares about me anymore so what am I fighting for?  I saw an article that talked about how hugs are vital to humans. That an average person needs 8 hugs a day just to function. Apparently a good hug is quite therapeutic. I haven't had a hug in a year. Most days I never even say a word out loud. 

I know a lot of people say this, but I am a good person. When I was healthy, I was helping build houses with Habitat, working with local animal shelters, helping elderly people, giving money to charity. I even started sponsoring a child in Africa several years ago but at the end of the day none of that seems to matter. Now I am just sick, broke and alone. I am hanging by a thread and I dont know what happens when that thread breaks. I was #2 in my high school class with a 4.0. I went to college for pre-med getting a degree in Biology and a minor in Chemistry and Biochemistry. I paid my way through school and worked hard to get those loans paid off. In the end, none of that mattered either. I really didn't think things could get this dark and hopeless.

8,"Here of late ive read alot, and listened to a fair amount of podcasts. Mainly about self discovery, mastering your mind, the power of your body/brain. I also approach everything with an open mind. So, with that in mind, here goes...

23(m) Tried Shrooms for the first time today, and it was quite the journey. I looked inward in ways that are just indescribable. 2 things i want to note in this little ramble, because maybe they'll make somebody laugh/have my current mindset. 

1) My brother (25m) also took shrooms (not first experience) and was playing xbox. His buddy started spamming him so he got on his phone to tell him to hold on. Well...instead of texting his buddy, he messaged his boss ""hold on im tripping balls"". Obviously panic sets in and just ends his trip (almost ending mine) until i focused back on myself. 

First experience was just unfortunate yet comical, second was more self discovery.

2) I was just lying in bed when i remembered somebody recommended music while you were High (such a bland word to use). And that changed everything. It felt like a disney movie mixed with a rap,rock,country,instrumental concert. You know how people associate songs with emotions and memory? Well have you ever just layed in bed and played song after song, drowing out all else. Each song bringing up good and bad memories, emotions, hopes, dreams. I was just in such appreciation of not only what I've been through, but what some many others have been through. Just lying in bed remembering so much, it was amazing. Ive looked at myself and i can genuinely feel like I've unlocked some part of myself (silly as it sounds). 

So, with all that being said. Be smart when using different approaches. Take appropriate measure, right environment, etc. Do your research. Most importantly, its all about perspective.

Tldr; If you've skipped to this, or made it this far i hope it left a positive impression. Stay open minded, do your research.",03Nov2019,1
9,"I’ve had bad eyesight ever since I was a kid, I’m blind in one eye. No surgery can fix it my brain tells my left eye not to work. Anyways I’ve been having some health issues a lot regarding my eyes lately so I booked an eye appointment with a specialist (where I typically go) I haven’t been since senior year I’m currently 20 years old.. during my appointment I was told there is a freckle behind what I would call my good eye (right one) I was told they’re common especially in people with fair skin and light eyes like myself. She also said it’s possible that it could of always been there just no one documented it anyways we took pictures of it to monitor it and she said to come back in 6 months to make sure it didn’t grow, she mentioned it’s rare that they do but it’s best to be monitored. SO I have been crying non stop the last two day’s over this, people are telling me I’m overreacting that I’m fine.  I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has a freckle behind their eye as well?? I’m just really worried because I’m only 20 years old and don’t want this to ruin my eyesight, but I don’t wanna be crying my eyes out the next 6 months.

10,"I don’t know what it is with me, but I have always struggled with self image. I used to be a chubby girl, more like thick. Slim belly, but had thighs and a butt. I got sick and lost a lot of weight. I was pushing 160 and I dropped down to between 125-130. It was like, I was a whole new person. I started obsessing with my weight though, like to the point where I would weigh myself at least 10 times a day. I would get so discouraged and hate myself depending on what the numbers on the scale said. But, I should be freaking proud of myself because I had a baby and I’m still within that weight range. But, here I am, obsessing because my scale said I was 134 tonight and again, I started to be like, “girlfriend, you shouldn’t have eaten that today, you’re looking like a blimp, you’re getting fat again.” And then I began to remember comments people had said about my weight. One woman I work with was all, “lay off the food, your ass is getting big” welllll, good thing big asses are in right now! A woman at daycare was all, “you’re not fat, but you were a lot smaller before you had your baby.” But, then I thought, all of my clothes still fit, I’m not noticing any large amount additional chub, why should I let the number determine the amount of love I give myself. So, here’s to hoping I will back off the scale and try to love my body the way it is.",03Nov2019,1
11,"I think a very young woman was trying to hint at going to my hotel room in the middle of the day while we were at work.

She and I had to go to the same place for different reasons, and part of it involved me trying on clothes, but her activity should have only taken a moment.  She hung around and we chatted about pretty much nothing, but she said, ""you have a place in the area?""  And I was like, ""yeah, they put me real close by"".  She sort of stood there and said, ""well, I guess I'm going to go hang out.""  And without realizing that we had a bunch of free time plus lunch, her asking if I had a place near by, I'm sitting there thinking this might have been her putting a simple math equation in front of me and me not realizing it.

It never occurred to me, mostly because I'm significantly older than her.  I think she's 18 (she has to be at least 18 for this work), and I'm in my 30s.

Upside is I got a lot of work done with all the free time?

I'm probably never going to know if she was trying to signal to me, but even if she was, I can't help but wonder if this is happening a lot and I just have no idea, especially with younger women making passes at much older men -- I'm well over 10 years older than her.

My pot dealer is away for several days so I can't get any. Dunno how I'll function without it. I shouldn't buy more wine tomorrow, I dunno if I will or not. All I want to do sober is lay in bed and bitch on Reddit. 

I've always, my entire life, been chronically bored of everything but also not wanting to do anything important, or outside of my comfort zone, or any work at all. Ever since elementary school I only ever had temporary distractions that, once again got tired of them, I'd have severe bouts of boredom in which I just wanted to die, but since going to college and coming back I've been able to mitigate that feeling with booze and pot. Even when I'm bored, I can just drink and smoke to make myself temporarily distracted, or more tired so I fall asleep and start the cycle again. 

I'm dragging down my parent supporting me, and I'm a disappointment to anyone who's had to rely on me, and known as generally ineffective to everyone. I want the resources to easily kill myself outside of my family's house, but obviously can't seem to make myself work for them, like anything.

15,"A friend linked me to a Quora question:

&gt; A billionaire hands you a unique and intricate coin. ""In an hour,"" he says, ""I will tell the world what I have given you. In a week, I will leave my inheritance to whoever returns it to me. I will not accept it before then."" What do you do?

Now, I don't have a Quora account because their ""you must use your real name"" policy can eat every dick on the planet Earth not currently in the possession of a human being, but I liked the question, I had a thunk, and here's my answer:

&gt; I put it in the mail for delivery to a fictitious person at a fictitious-but-plausible rural address (IE, the street and ZIP are legit but the number is out-of-range) in the Middle of Nowhere, Bumfuck, Hawaii, Alaska, Oregon, Florida, Maine, Texas, or Montana. The key is that it has to *appear* deliverable and thus be forwarded properly *right up until* the carrier determines that no such numbered address exists. It'll take more than a week for it to get there, be determined to be undeliverable, and be returned-to-sender.

&gt; I will then place myself under 24hr surveillance and tell world + dog exactly what I have done except for any specifics about to where I have mailed it, and make note of the fact that both capitol murder and tampering with the U.S. Mail are felonies that will preclude getting to enjoy any billionaire's inheritance, and that any person but myself taking possession of that coin will be *prime facie* evidence that at least one of those two crimes has been committed.

&gt; After this I contact a lawyer an offer them 5% of my net inheritance to help me with the legal stuff going forward, and get them to write out some kind of contract that promises another 5% of that net inheritance to a private armed security firm to give me 24/7 armed protection and a major armored and armed escort to the billionaire's shack if I arrive safe and unharmed and the appropriate contracts are drawn up by my lawyer and signed by the billionaire and his lawyer and some appropriate witnesses. My contract with the armed security firm will include some *ruinous* penalties if they stiff me, relieve me of my coin at gunpoint and deliver it themselves - including 100% of the billionaire's inheritance plus a considerable extra amount, to be split with my lawyer if they actually pull that dumbass move.

&gt; Thus I will get my coin back safely. The USPS will, rather frustratedly, reclassify any deliveries to my home as high-risk and take appropriate measures to ensure their last-mile carriers on my routes go unmolested and that the returned letter is placed into my own hands. They'll be getting some *nice* gifts come christmastime. Thereforth I shall board the armored car that has been stationed at my home by my private security firm, we'll pick up my lawyer, and head to Mr. Coinhead's House to deliver the coin and claim my inheritance. Then I'll shake hands with my lawyer and the security guys, thank them, and tell them I'll see them again at the viewing.

Basically some people felt threatened by my art and hacked into my computer and broke all the art project files of the artworks I was so proud of and had almost finished so I could show everyone them. My latest image I'd been working on every day for two whole months. My family were very excited to see the finished result and said if I finished it they'd send the image to a 3D animation studio to see if I could work there as a 3D artist. i had a deviantart account with 1,300 followers and when I posted about what happened and the hacker(s) to go fuck themselves, seems my ''fans'' have all gone quiet. I'm going to deactivate my account on there soon.

My therapist told me to make art to ease stress because I also happen to have a brain tumor which causes me daily pain and creating things helps distract from that and one of the only things that still makes me feel like a kid and makes me genuinely happy.

There's a good chance I will never be able to make art again because I was a 3D artist using Maya 2016 and Renderman 21 and they don't make Renderman 21 anymore, that crappy Renderman 22 isn't compatible with Maya 2016, and Maya 2018 and 2019 cost thousands and I just do not have the money. Without Renderman, the renders look very dated (using Maya's default renderer), and that is not what I want. I've been crying pretty much all day because art means a lot to me and it's months upon months of hard work, blood, sweat and tears, just destroyed.

My plan B was a law enforcement job and I can't be a police officer due to my eyesight (can't drive) so closest thing to that is prison warden so that's what it looks like I'm going to do since i live basically next door to a prison and i can just walk there. but being a prison warden doesn't capture that whimsical sense of wonder and happiness in seeing something you imagine come to life exactly how you imagined it all in realistic 3D.

40,"Backstory: On April 27, 2011, there was the Super Outbreak of tornadoes. It was the day before my 8th birthday. 

I lived on Lake Martin, Alabama, and still do today. My family and I turned on the news and watched the tornadoes ravage through Tuscaloosa and Birmingham that afternoon. Of course I, being 8, had no real understanding of what was really going on because of the standard cognitive ability of a brain of that age. Later on, I remember us eating dinner around 7:30 PM. Around that time, a tornado had touched down west of us and was on a direct path to our house. By 8:00 PM, my parents said that we had to go to a neighbors house that had a basement, since our house didn’t have one. My mom threw a bike helmet at me and told me to put it on, and I did. We jumped into my dad’s truck and booked it to the neighbors’ house. 

Once we arrived, we headed straight to the basement with a weather radio and a flashlight (the neighbors weren’t home and we had a key to the house). All the power was out. Nearly all phone towers were out. There was nothing we could do except for take the mattress off their bed, take it to the basement (which is the size of a small closet) and manage to get under it. We heard the pits of hell riding outside, noises I can’t even describe. Eventually, my dad got tired of being under the mattress, leapt up, and went to look out the windows onto the lake. He yelled at us to come and see what he was seeing. We watched the EF5 tornado travel across the lake, cutting into the water and spitting it along with other debris in every direction. A portion of a wooden fence then flew through the window next to us, and we took that as a sign to get the hell back to the basement. We stayed in there until about 11:00 PM. All fell silent around that time. We stepped outside the house to see what had happened. 

The house on the left of the one we were in was completely gone, zero trace of it’s prior existence. The one to the right of ‘our’ house had two massive trees fallen onto it. ‘Our’ house also had a tree go through it, on the other side of the basement we were in. At this point, we tried to get back to our actual house, but we were blocked in by many trees and power lines in the roads. We were forced to go back to that house and sleep until the morning. 

We woke up bright and early and tried to get back home. We were still trapped in, but there were many people working to clear the roads. While we were waiting, we walked around. We found some very unfortunate things and pieces of debris, most notably body parts. I picked up these parts and those memories are still burned into my brain to this day. Eventually, we made it back to our actual house, to find absolutely no damage to any of our property. 

It’s still a joke between me, family, and friends:       “You had a great birthday present, didn’t you?” Yeah, spiffing. Lol.",03Nov2019,2

45,"A little background, I've been working at my current job for nearly 2 years now. It's a retail gig, nothing too special. I've always prided myself on trying to always keep busy and do the best job that I can, and I'm not content to sit at the bottom and never advance anywhere. Luckily, I was able to snag a full-time position when it opened near the start of the year, but it isn't exactly where I want to be. 

To get where we are now, 2 positions have opened up that I could possibly be promoted to. One of them being management and the other being a title that comes with a bit higher pay. I apply for the management position and am told by my boss not to worry if I don't get it because I am first in line for the title change. That's nice and all, except he fills the position he promised me a week before the interviews for the management position take place. Whatever, maybe I can land the management position. I've prepared hard for it after all, and it shows in the interview. Nope, don't get that either. It goes to some guy who hasn't worked there 2 months and who my boss is doing business with outside of work I would later come to find out.

I'm not supposed to worry, though, you see, because my boss tells me an ""exciting opportunity"" is going to open up, and yours truly of course will probably have a good shot at it (ah, maybe this promise will turn out just like the last one). I'm not stupid, I know that whatever it is is complete bullshit and more than likely won't come through, so I do some thinking and decide I'm tired of the shitty fucking area I live in and that now would be the perfect time to go live with some of my other family who have been bugging me to move down in the more prosperous area of the country they live in.

So here we are today. I have some interviews down in my future home and am pretty much making the final preparations to start heading that way. Everyone knows at this point that I'm not long for the job. My boss tells me he wants to talk to me in his office. Remember that ""exciting opportunity?"" Well, basically, it was another management position opening in the store because he's going to fire one of the managers (how exciting for them!). I bet you think you know where this is going, right, well, no, you don't, not at all, you see, he's already made up his mind to give this new position to the guy he gave the title change to. He says I can have the title change if I stay, though. LMFAO the absolute fucking balls on this dude. Basically if I had stuck around like a chump he would have given the ""exciting opportunity"" to someone else without even really considering me for the position. It's ok, though, because I can have the position I was promised months ago, and only because literally nobody else really gives a shit about it.

I think I'm not even going to wait until I have a job lined up to put my 2 weeks in at this point. I have enough money to survive a couple of months. This shit is just completely and utterly ridiculous.

TL;DR: Boss promises me position, gives it to someone else after turning me down for promotion. Promises me that I'm highly considered for ""exciting opportunity"", find out he already has someone else in mind before ""exciting opportunity"" is even available.",03Nov2019,117

So today I asked her to buy a whiteboard and write down the people who have passed away since the day I left. I asked for 3 columns: name, day of death, reason of death (spoiler alert, it's mostly cancer). Surprisingly, given her Asian background where death jokes are taboo, she finds it funny.

71,"All my life was a struggle. From the time I was 2, and my mom and I had to leave my abusive dad, it’s been a hard life. Never enough money, sometimes homeless, sometimes without food. My mom became ill when I was a teenager, so then it became my responsibility to care for her. I love her, so I was happy to do it, but at the same time, I never had my own life. I left school, got a job, and worked hard to care for her, and myself, ever since. 

Through all of this, I did a lot of dreaming, fantasizing, whatever you want to call it.  I believed that when I grew a little older, I was destined for great things because I had struggled. Mainly though, I dreamed of love. Like deep, intense, pure love. I even created this whole story of who he’d be... what he would look like, his occupation, how’d he care for me, even his name. 

And then, I met someone, a few years ago. He certainly wasn’t THE man from my dreaming, but he was handsome, tall, creative, and I was really infatuated with him. I thought he could be the one. I thought I finally had been given a break in life. 

But he became more and more abusive; first just emotionally, then verbally, and finally physically. He smashed nearly a dozen bones in my body. 

And now I am in my 30s. And alone. And I know I’ll never find that man from my dreams. And I am devastated. Because all I want in life is him... and he doesn’t exist.  I never get out and do anything, partly because I’m always just working, so I never really meet anyone. Plus, my anxieties are many.

76,"One of my favorite things to look for in life is to stumble upon these so called moments of awe, slices of inspiration, sudden surge of emotions. I found it in many places but there has always been an element of unpredicability. I don't know when the next such moment would come but I do know sometimes I can find it in anime, movies, in the small hours of the morning, late at night, in music, in novels occasionally.

I am addicted to these moments. I want to find more. It's almost as if these moments give meanings to my life. I am pretty set on my belief. I don't think life has inherent meanings. I don't believe we have this set destiny to create something great, grand and to be remembered by our grand kids. I wish I could believe my life were like that but these are things that can't be forced on. Recently, I found that having these moments do help me cope with the lack of meaning. I found that I am in constant search for these greater moments to lean on, which is itself pretty disingenuous to my prior thought process that I am ok with not having any meanings at all.

The fact is, I am not ok. I want to be special. I want to believe there's something to feel special. The ability to find these moments and feel something genuine out of these moments are private to me and me alone, as if I just discovered one of the many great secrets life have in store.

Film critics call these romanticized view of life. It is life affirming in nature. The central assumption behind these thoughts is that life is full of great mysteries, infinitely seductive, helplessly elusive. If you want to uncover these, you need to go on an adventure. It can be an adventure of the everyday. It can be mundane at a cursory glance but upon closer examination, they'd stand out. It's almost as if I am searching for that red x on a treasure map on my everyday journey to school and that treasure just so happen to be in plain sight, mostly ignored unless I pass some special requirements.

This thought of going on an adventure is so appealing. It's almost as if it's having a dialog with some unknown forces beyond time and space directly. That excites me greatly. I want to be find that thing. I want to find more of that thing.

I think I am a little more honest now that I had ever been and I think authenticity is one of these special requirements to be able to embark on this journey. The fact I am aware of this makes me proud. It makes me happy. As I am writing, I see sunlights beaming through the blinds.

80," My  biggest desire in Life due to me  having an overwhelming powerful   imagination inside my head. Is to  become a Storyteller. And by doing   that I'll have to get Comic book  publishing company.  And working with a   team to help bring make all of  my visions Reality. Poring all of my  imagination and thoughts into these comics. 

 ""Spider-man The Adventures of Dave and the  Spider-squad"" will be  amazingly Cinematic. So much so that it'll feel like you'll be watching a  Movie inside of a little book. 

 My  biggest  Comic series that I'll  be working is a Story that has been  inspired  from ""Spider-man Into the  spider-verse"". With Miles Morales  saying at  the end of the Film,  ""Anyone can wear the mask"". Indeed anyone  can wear  the mask. So that's  what this Story of mine is going to  resemble.

This   series is called,  ""Spider-man The Adventures of Dave and the   Spider-squad"".  These Comics  will be extremely cinematic. As if you'll   be watching a Movie inside of a  book basically.  The protagonist is   an  18 year old bullied  boy named  Dave.  Dave's personally and  emotions  is very similar to  mines.

The    plot of this is Story  is ""One  morning, Dave had woken up from bed  to   see a small bite mark on  his  hand. Little did he know that he had  been   bite by a radioactive  spider.  Giving him amazing superpowers  that   allows him to become a  Reality  warper"".

 Now   that Dave had  become  a  Reality warper. He has turned his Reality  into  a complete  fantasy   world. Bringing all kinds of amazing things  from  his imagination  to   life. Dave had also brought some of his own   Spider-men and women to    life. specifically from anime. Such as ""Fate   Stay Night"".

In    this Film, Dave   and the gang travels through different    Dimensions/Universes. Mainly   from video games such as ""Dark souls III""    ""Legend of Zelda"" ""Fornite""   ""Metal gear solid"" and ""Final Fantasy"".    Fighting different monsters   and enemy's from these Universes.

Some     of those anime  Spider-men/Spider-women will be from actual anime    shows  such as ""Soul  Eater"", ""Fate Stay Night"" and ""Comet Lucifer"".    Mainly  cause of all the  girls from these shows! Like Liz and Patty,    Kaon,  Sougo, Roman, Saber,  Rin Tohsaka Ect.

Rhino  will also be an extremely powerful villain/enemy in these Comics of  mine. So much so that he actually becomes an annoying  O.P. nuance that  Dave and the spider-gang constantly have to keep running into.

I     love anime  mainly cause of these beautiful girls! All of they're     Spider-woman suits  in my Stories will have holes in the center of     they're suits so all of  you readers would see they're belly buttons.

I      forgot to tell you that I'm also into feet. Basically like Quentin      Tarantino. There won't be a lot of feet scenes in my Movie series,  but     there will definitely be a good amount of them in a few number  of   scenes   throughout the Story.

The    stunts   and fight scenes will most definitely  the best thing's  about   these   Stories. Such as Dave and his crew jumping off extremely  tall   structures    with an overhead view to make it feel like you're   actually  there.

They will also  be  fighting  monsters from my own imagination. Such as a giant  beautiful  anime girl  wearing a crop-top. And a giant evil angry  Hitler. Both of  them can  shoot fireballs from they're mouths. They  will also try and  eat Dave and  the gang during the fight.

Anyway, that's my biggest Life goal.",03Nov2019,0

83,"I had a flashback to my abusive childhood last night. 

The thing about flashbacks is they're so real and vivid. Most of the time when I'm merely remembering my childhood the memories feel so dusty and ancient, like I'm remembering something from a storybook. Which is strange, considering some of these memories are less than four years old. 

The flashback felt fresh and real and my senses were electrified during it. 

Flashbacks are not fun, but at least I felt some form of connection to my past self, like she was a real person and not some fairytale character I buried a long time ago. 

I'm being abused by my partner. I asked myself if this younger version of myself would be happy if she knew what her future as it is now looks like. 

What really depresses me is I think she'd be overjoyed because my abusive partner looks like a dream compared to my mother.

I was rejected and abused by my mother every day. She made cruelty a sport and I can never forget the gleam in her otherwise dead eyes whenever she practiced such cruelty. 

It's hard to explain to people who don't understand, but when you've been abused as a child you can become numb to abuse. Your normal metre is broken. 

You can ignore when you're being abused, brush it off and pretend everything is fine. 

You can even love the person who hurts you. 

I was born into a family that only wanted to harm me, and when the authorities chose to look the other way I had no choice but to wait until the earth had circled around the sun enough times that I was finally allowed to be safe. 

But I almost immediately fell for an abusive man and ended up in another abusive (yet nowhere near as bad) situation.

My friend says I have Stockholm syndrome. Maybe that's true. 

I do believe there's something wrong with me because I should be desperate to escape this relationship, yet I wish I didn't have to. 

I can't even understand my apprehension to leave a situation that will only harm me, stunt me and put me at risk, so I can't expect others too. 

But I wish someone did understand how I felt. I wish someone who loved their abuser but eventually chose to leave could talk to me and impart some wisdom. 

I've tried to reach out on reddit to people who've been in my situation, and occasionally something resonates with me. I like that. 

My resolve comes and goes. I wish I could say leaving takes a few moments of courage. But it takes more than that to stay away. 

Just now as I'm finishing up writing this I'm determined to leave. I know within hours I'll want to stay. I know I have to leave, I'm going to leave. But it's scary and I just need to get all my words down and out there somewhere. It's therapeutic and I'm not sure why. 


Thank you if you've made it this far.",03Nov2019,1
84," Honestly, I just can't understand nor  fathom why most the majority of  people can go watch Movies, read cool,  creative, imaginative Books, Novels, Anime, Comics, or play super  imaginative &amp; fantasy Video  games, and then later on they just go  back to reality, as if nothing  happens, and they're ok with everything.

Reality  is so unfair, cruel, boring,   ect. Full of   litter, angry  people,  rude drivers, and businesses.    There is no happiness to it.  No   magic. Nothing.  Reality is extremely   boring and  limited.  un-comparing to how exciting,  mind-blowing,   magical, thrilling,  and  overall interesting our  imagination can be.   Such as Movies, Comics,   Video games ect. Which most  of them are made   from very intelligent   people in the World.

Especially     when you've realized that nothing we do here in Reality will  ever     compare to our imaginations.  I'm not talking about petty,  shallow,     superficial, &amp; stupid imaginations like most people only  have  in     the World.  I'm talking about all those  amazing, phenomenal,  and     fantastic fantasy movies, games, comic  books, anime/manga, etc,  with      all their magic, superpowers, &amp;  magical, fantasy,  adventurous      world/universe with its limitless,  unlimited  possibilities.

 Movies  are honestly the ones that  I'm most jealous of in Life. Probably more than anything. I've always  wished  that I  could live in just about any Movie/Film I want to be a  part of.  My most  favorite one being ""Spider-man Into the Spider  verse"".  All you  could do  is just go to the Cinema and watch all of  the fictional  characters in  the Films have much, much more better,   exciting,  mind-blowing, magical,  and thrilling lives than you. The  only thing you  can do is just  silently watch. I just wish we all could  go through a  portal that allows us to enter all of these things.

Have  any of you heard the ""Avatar syndrome"" ?. It's basically  the  post-effects that many people apparently got, after watching the  movie  ""Avatar"" (James Cameron). It's the feeling of depression, because   they're back to reality again, after watching (&amp; experiencing) such   magical, cool, awesome, mind-blowing, breath-taking, &amp; beautiful   'other-worlds' of Avatar world.

1. I wish all Movies/Films was real. Movies are better than Reality/Real Life/Real World.
2. I wish all Video games was real. Video games are better than Reality/Real Life/Real World.
3. I wish all Comics was real. Comics are better than Reality/Real Life/Real World.
4. I wish all books was real. Books are better than Reality/Real Life/Real World.
5. I wish all Anime was real. Anime are  better than Reality/Real Life/Real World.
6. I wish all Novels was real. Novels are better than  Reality/Real Life/Real World.
7. I wish all Art was Real. Art is better than Reality/Real Life/Real World.
8. I wish all TV Shows was real. TV shows is better than Reality/Real Life/Real World.
9. I wish all Fantasy was real. Fantasy is better than Reality/Real Life/Real World.
10. I wish our Imaginations was real. Imaginations is better than Reality/Real Life/Real World.
11. I wish all Fiction was real. Fiction is better than Reality/Real Life/Real World.

85,"Well to be exact, an in-game corporation. It was my first ever corporation I was in and these people taught me how to play the game, I’ve been with them for 8 months and I loved them. I loved talking to them, I loved playing with them.  I still can’t deal woth it after a few days of being told to pack up my things and leave. It’s just cruel that with no warnings I got kicked out. The reason I got kicked out was because few people complained about me and it hurts so much that people would ever hate me so much to want me gone. I’d have never guessed this was coming. 

I don’t know how to deal with this at all, I lost all my motivation to do anything at all, don’t want to even play video games anymore, I don’t know what to do with myself and yes I know it’s super stupid I got attached so much to a video game but that happens when you play with the same people every day for a long time...",03Nov2019,9

No matter what I do I end up in this dark place. I always treat everyone the best way I can, being kind, friendly and sweet and so far that has only led to being taken for granted. I want good friends I can trust, that want to make me happy, but it's like everyone is so focused on themselves... I know I'm not entitled to getting anything from anyone. I just wish it happened, you know...

I need someone to understand me and comfort me. It sounds really selfish to me but it would make me so happy. I want intimacy, love... But so far I just feel like my heart is bleeding and I wish I wasn't awake.",03Nov2019,0
87," I've hated this Real World for a very  long time. So much so that I actually fantasize that I'm Omnipotent,  and have much more better and interesting Life. And that's by creating  some epic phenomenal fantasy Worlds/Universes in my own head. Most of  them are shaped like an endless Movie. Here's some of the Universes  inside my head that I created.

This    World/Universe that I created is a Universe that is completely all   about  Cinema, and when I say Cinema, I  mean all Movies that were ever  made in  existence  in this imaginary World. From  around 500,000+  Movies in  existence. With new ones being made every Year. My most favorite one being  ""Spider-man Into the Spider  verse"". Any and   everything in this World  is 3D computer animated, just  like from the  Film. Including myself.   In the Universe I am Spider-man in my own epic  suit, with it being mixed  with black and red. This World/Universe is  basically an endless Movie.

 there are around 500,000+ Films in existence. With new ones being made  and released every single month and year. Every one of them have been  brought to Life in this  imaginary Universe inside my head. Everything  is this imaginary   Universe will  personally be 3D computer animated,  just like Into the  Spider-verse.  Any and everything can happen in this  one Universe I  created.  

 This World/Universe will kinda be like ""Avengers Endgame"", ""Infinity War"", ""Wreck It Ralph"", or ""Ready  Player One"" for example . 

 I  even brought  all the characters  from Into the Spider verse,  even my  soulmate Peni Parker to Life in  this imaginary Universe, plus, some new random   anime   Spider-Men/Spider-Women out of my imagination. Now that  they're   all   under my complete control, just for fun, I also might create evil      versions of every single last one of them just they all can fight they    own selves. Since I can see everything at the exact same time, I'll   give all of the characters from into the spider verse, including my  Anime   Spider-men/Spider-women immortality. and go on  Massive  journey's together in this    Universe as one, fighting all kinds of   villains/monsters of my    overwhelming imagination. PS, me and the  Spider-gang Will also be  fighting all Villains of Spider-man Throughout  this epic phenomenal   journey with the main enemy be Venom, obviously,  Plus some   monsters  from  my imagination like an enormous  beautiful   Anime  girl  and a  giant Hitler that'll try  and eat us.

I   get so  emotionally involved in just about everything in this    Universe. Not just being with my Spider-gang and my soulmate Peni    Parker, but just about every allie that we all meet while on our    journey. So much so that I actually cry for real. Just wishing that    this Universe I created was Reality. Everyone in this Universe is so nice and caring and looks after each other.  Including myself. In fact, my    Spider-gang is so crazy about me that They actually follow me and watch    over me just about everywhere we go. We go and  have Private meeting's  in   our enormous mansion that we all live in inside this Universe. I  create a Map ether   on the floor or table, depending on where we're all  at right now, and show them   all new settings and tactics I want us in  about to use in every fight   that we get ourselves involved in.  Especially for the two monsters that   we'll be Facing, The giant  beautiful crop top Anime girl and giant  Hitler.",03Nov2019,1
88,"I’m going to use my personal story as a placeholder for this information, and i’m going to use my real experiences to hopefully give my knowledge of parental abuse to this subreddit, and how it affects kids. 

Okay, i’m 17 right now, and you guys on here might see that as too young an age to be talking about this, “i don’t know the ins and outs” “your too young to know what your talking about”. Firstly, fuck off thank you, and secondly, i DO know what it’s like, and i’m going to tell you what it’s like. 

Growing up in the 80’s, my father was raised with his 2 other siblings in rural British Colombia, Canada, and he was raised by his father and mother, and then father and step mother. My grandfather abused my aunt (dads sister) growing up and made her extremely resentful and depressed until she moved out at 16 to live with her friends. After this the abuse carried over to my dad, who was 13 at the time, and had a very lasting impact on him. My father watched his own father fight consistently with his mother until she just moved out one day, and not one month after there was a new women in the house, (call her R). Dad hated R, not because she was R, but because she was his new “mom” and was living with them. My dad moved out at 18 and lived extremely close to the poverty line a couple times, and didn’t even go to any post secondary school in Canda, until his actual mother dragged him to Welding school. 

Fast forward 10 years, my dads 28, and is a certified welder and is doing well. Dad meets mom while on vacation in Australia, they fall in love and dad stays in Australia and they get married there. They come back to Canada, and move back to my Dads hometown. Mom gets pregnant and gives birth to me on July 19th. And  then fast forward again about 10 years, my mother gave birth to my 3 other siblings and i’m about 10 at this point, almost able to do harder chores, and about the time where the abuse came out. It was small at first, occasional voice raising and “why are you acting like an idiot” stuff like that, which i was fine with. 

But i was a little shit as a kid which didn’t couple well with my dads short temper, i’d lie about stupid stuff and try to shove candy wrappers down sides of couches to hide them so i didn’t have to throw them away (lmao), and every time
my dad caught me doing something like this, he’d freak the fuck out. Yelling, screaming, when i was smaller he’d physically drag me somewhere private to just scream in my face where no one could here him, and my mother would always plead for him to go easy and stop, it never did. 

Fast forward about 5 years, im 15 now, and the abuse has only gotten worse now that i’m self aware about it, it’s upgraded from yelling, to making me feel like shit, and making it seem like i really was an idiot, he’d say stuff like “no one in his house will ever fucking trust you”, because i took 2$ i found in my room that i guess wasn’t mine, or he’d say “Shut the fuck up you pussy, your a little pussy girl”. Stuff like that. But oh man, do you know how much it hurt? i haven’t even talked about that yet, my god, it hurt. Parents here, have you ever layed awake in bed and wondered what the fuck you did wrong ? wondering when your dad was going to burst your bedroom door open and scream at you for anything, do you know how that feels? 

When i was 15 my parents split. I saw it coming a mile away, my dad always gave my mom a personal level of verbal abuse daily, and manipulating here so she felt bad, and you know what? she stayed in that toxic fucking marriage because she has 3 kids she needed to protect, she jump hoops of mental manipulation for her kids, on a side note, i think that’s true bravery and any mother who has done that has my immediate and everlasting respect 

My tolerance for the abuse snapped when he told me “If you were 18 right now we’d be on the street and i’d be kicking your ass”. How do you think that made me feel? how do you think having your father, the person who raised you, say he wants to punch his creation of life in the face? It felt like a dagger in my heart, and that was his go to insult until i left, he’d scream at me, take me in his truck, drive around and scream more so no one heard him until i’d be crying in the passenger seat begging him to stop anywhere so i could get out and run away anywhere, just away from all the abuse and yelling there was. 

My mom got her own place and got a job fairly quickly and i used her as my outlet and she opened up my mind to what was really going on with my dad. My mom thinks he had NPD (narcissistic personality disorder), i forget all the medical knowhow for it but it explained all his abusive traits and emonital fractures. I was confused, angry, depressed and dissapointed that i was getting all of this abuse and no one else was, my 17 year old coil said “i’ve had enough” in September, and moved in with my mom. 

It’s been good so far, albiet from what happened last night (i’ll tell that at the end) and i’ve gotten a professional therapist to help me with the anxiety and consistent fearfulness of life itself my father gave me, it’s getting better, it really is. 

Last night was a competle violation of my safety and i was considering posting it to r/legaladvice 
because, it’s November now and i haven’t seen my dad in 2 months, and i had my special needs sister upstairs asleep and my two friends over and we were smoking a little weed, ones 18 yrs and me and the other are 17. At around 9pm my little brother comes to my moms because he forgot his playstation and grabbed it, not even 5 minutes later my dad bursts through my moms door, and proceeds to tell me to get the small bong we had on the counter away (he doesn’t live her he can’t tell me what to do”) i say “What are you doing here ?!?” and he says back “i’m calling the fucking cops on you”. After that i sent all my friends home and sat in my room just, empty, i felt like all my progress i’ve done in the past months just got ripped away and i’m back at square one, i feel fucked and useless, he ruins my life and my mother tells me try to feel bad for him because he has a mental illness, but my god, i wish that man wasn’t my father in any way possible.",03Nov2019,0
90,"This is the first year that I decided I would participate in Sober October, and it was pretty much motivated by curiosity. I am a self-admitted beer snob, and certainly enjoy a cold one on my own as much as with company. I first wanted to see how it would affect my weight, my wallet, and my overall energy level. And for the record, I took ""sober"" to mean complete abstinence from all alcohol for the whole 31 days. And high-fives to me: I succeeded!

Overall, I haven't seen any major changes on those areas I was observing, so that was slightly disappointing. I just weighed myself now and I'm down exactly 2# from where I started the month at. But throughout the month I was up and down and with no discernible pattern.

As for my wallet... the wife and I talked about if I was allowed to *buy* beer at the store to save for later. We agreed that it could only be for seasonal or rare stuff that I wouldn't be able to get come November. I made a couple stops toward the end of the month for a little over $100 worth, but I didn't notice all these extra hundreds of dollars in my account. Oh well.

Energy level? I haven't noticed anything in particular there due to not drinking. I'd say on an average week with no special events, I'd maybe have 5-8 drinks total. I have been sleeping better and waking up with better energy, but I mostly attribute that to a conscious effort to curb my night owl habits and get to bed at more reasonable hours (ie - before midnight).

Some other random observations:

1. Twice during the month did I have dreams about reflexively opening a drink before I realized what I was doing. Even in my dream, I felt disappointed that I'd slipped so easily. Then I woke up and felt... slightly better? I found it weird that my efforts even invaded my dreams.

2. I had my first drink last night, just a 16 oz can of an old favorite. There was no rush of relief or major itch to scratch. Just the enjoyment of a cold brew, consideration of getting a 2nd, then went to bed instead.

3. Wife and I went to a Harry Potter-themed festival early in October, and some of the bars were serving their versions of butterbeer in adult and kiddie versions. I was initially annoyed that I couldn't/shouldn't get the adult version... but then I felt guilty that my first feeling about not drinking alcohol was annoyance. I think that's something for me to work on. We got the kiddie versions (since she's also pregananant) and still had a great time.

4. My thoroughly retired father heard about it through me, and thought he'd do his own version. He definitely enjoys a glass of wine or two at his leisure, so he tried to back that off a bit. His initial rule was ""I can have a glass at dinner if your mom does too"" (which is rare). I have no idea if he stuck to this rule. I'm thinking not, because he had 21 red dots on the calendar. He tried to say they were half-glasses or something, but I left it at that. I felt annoyed that he seemed to completely ignore the spirit of the challenge, but I'm glad I didn't know about that while I was going through it.

I think that's about it for now. I know other people do this for different reasons and with different results. And maybe I'm just yelling into the void, but I wanted to jot down my own thoughts while they were still fresh. (If there's a better sub to post this in, please let me know.) Regardless, I'd still love to hear other people's thoughts on my experience OR thoughts on their own experiences with doing Sober October. I'm gonna go grab a can and head for my post-exercise shower. Be kind and be healthy, everyone!",03Nov2019,4

92,"I’m a male in my 20s and have been married for a while. My marriage isn’t going too well. Nothing to do with this but I have noticed that I still want to have sex live every day with my wife even though we’re probably getting a divorce and she has made me feel disgusting. This has been going on even before divorce was brought up. Every time I ask if she wants to do it she throws a fit and gets mad. Sex in our relationship has always been a problem. I mean she’s very conservative with it. Like I have to earn it or something and I’m tired of it. Every time I touch her even if it’s not sexual she says ew and pushes me away. I’m very faithful and I would never go out of our marriage for sex but it’s getting kinda old. Oh and god forbid I masturbate. Am I addicted to sex or is this normal? If so idk how to bring it up or i should even. I believe we’re still trying to make things work but I’m tired of my wife shutting me down every time. Whenever she wants to have sex, it’s not even a question, she just grabs my dick and it just gets hard even if I don’t wanna have sex and she hops on. I let her finish of course but it feels very one sided. Do I need help? Any advice on how to “calm yourself”. I feel disgusting now every time my dick gets hard even if it’s just morning wood.

93,"I think i sorted my mind a little since i posted here last time and i'm even more confused as to why i'm having this issue

so, to tell the story in short, my problem is that i have thoughts of horror, sometimes gore that i can't keep out of my mind. They just appear seemingly randomly. mostly my mind makes up creepy stuff, like there is something behind me and when i turn around it's behind me again.

these thoughts appear only after the sun sets, but not always. it just starts when i think about it and it won't stop for some time.
1 out of 7 times it starts with a jumpscare that just appears in my head for no good reason. none of this ever happens during the day or when i'm outside for some reason

seems normal enough, but i don't watch any horror/gore/jumpscary stuff and my mind just keeps spamming the faces i know from ads, memes and whatnot.

at least once a week i lay in bed with my eyes closed and suddely i feel like something is watching me from like a feet away. i open my eyes and suprise there is nothing. if i close my eyes again, the feeling intensifies, along with an image of what is watching me. the only thing that seems to help is keeping my eyes open untill i lose conciousness as i am releaved with the sweet slumber. sadly keeping the light on doesn't help

it's hard to explain, but whatever i think about turns scary. when i try to think of a person, the face i imagine is horribly distorted or has a terrible grin and and eyes with no soul. When i try to think about my current metalworking projects, whatever it is seems like an intense threat. imagine being afraid of a regular screw or a handsaw. everything gives of this vibe you get from horror music

There was this new girl in class, we were classmates and she's absolutely cute and has unique personality. Since first day in class i wanted to ask her out but got crippled by my overthinking... I literally dreamed over and over again how she would say no. It became an obsession, not that i stalked her or anything but i ended up improving myself over the next 6 months, gym, reading and social skills just to surpass the image of her rejecting me in my head. We started hanging out over summer, still i ended up overthinking and dreaming the worst rejections, that's where i couldn't improve myself on my anxiety mirror anymore, i was going crazy, then decided to finally tell her just to get a REAL no.
I owe her what i am now, looking back at it i would be more afraid of handling a yes... I take on life as an engine and pride is my fuel, i can handle rejection but having her as a friend makes me feel like i don't have to surpass myself, and that makes me even more ambitious",03Nov2019,0

Then we got to talking about our high school experiences and I explained how I was always picked on and pushed around (strangled once).

So she asks me this question: ""why does everything happen to *you*?"".  I don't have an answer to that.  Why does life always dump down on me?  Why do people always manipulate me?  Why do *I* always get the short end of the stick???

I know there is absolutely ZERO chance of him liking me because he is part of the ""popular"" kids and we are NOT even in the same grade.

100,"Around this time I was absolutely heartbroken after my ex boyfriend suddenly broke up with me out of the blue. He went from one minute being loving to the next breaking things off. It gave me really bad emotional whiplash.

And well, the positive news is that I dont miss the romantic relationship we had. My heart belongs to a different man now, and we are more stable together than my ex. But I miss his friendship, and knowing that the romantic relationship we had ruined it just makes me feel terrible.

Before we were even together we used to fool around and tell our darkest secrets to eachother, and just generally be really good support to eachother. Its rare to find someone you connect that way with, and to see them go away so quickly makes me in particular feel heavy of heart. 

Everyone around thinks I have disdain toward my ex, but I just miss him. I try to act standoffish about it as a defense mechanism because i dont want to feel vulnerable after all this time, and i especially dont want to come off like I miss him in a romantic or sexual context.

 Whenever we're put into situations where we have to interact via some random social situation, its like we both light up toward eachother for that one tiny, tiny millisecond. Then that wall of fear and awkwardness shoehorns itself between us. At least, thats how it is on my end of things. He probably feels completely different than I do. 

I should just let go, and I would, but I have to see him at school every day. It feels unnatural to be awkward and closed off toward him when we used to be so close and friendly toward eachother, and it really sucks. I just wish that wall of fear could fall down and we can be awesome besties again, but it just isnt like that and I gotta move on.",03Nov2019,5
101,"
My friends and I (all 16 years old, juniors in high school) went to our schools football game on Friday. It was a smallish group of us consisting of my friends, my ex and my ex’s friends. One of my friend, my ex and his friends eventually wandered away from the group to go get food, this was fine since the rest of my friends and I don’t really get along with my ex and his friends. It’s totally chill. Then my friend we’ll call him J, wanders off with his friend who’s a girl with a boyfriend to be alone with her I’ll call her T. This leave my friend M and I alone for about an hour. At this point I’m pretty pissed off because truth be told M and I both went out of our way to hang out with J, and the fact that he left us alone had me pretty upset. 

M and I eventually decide to go find J and T and they’re alone on the other side of the stadium. In this I say playfully “hey assholes come join us back on our side” they follow us back reluctantly. Eventually some time passes of us sitting back on our side and J and T leave again. This has me really upset because J is honestly my best friend and the fact that he keeps leaving when we’re all trying to hang out feels wrong. He hardly spoke to either M or myself all night despite the fact that we were out as a group. 

Later that night at home I text J and tell him that I wouldn’t have gone out if I had known that I was going to be left alone. He says he’s sorry and that he didn’t divide his time properly. I’m still pretty pressed about the whole thing so I just say okay and goodnight.

The next day I try texting him and he ignores me and when I ask if he’s ignoring me he says he doesn’t want to talk to me if I’m going to keep being mad and passive aggressive. I try to explain to him that, I’m not mad I was hurt that he kept leaving when I care about him a lot and I wanted to spend time with him. 

I do understand that although I am partially in the wrong for being passive aggressive with him, he has been ignoring me for over 24 hours. I’ve tried texting him multiple times saying that I would like to resolve this and that I’m not pissed off at him, that I was hurt at the time and that’s why I was acting the way I was. Him ignoring me feels really childish which is incredibly unlike him. I was talking to M about this whole thing and she said that she had texted him earlier and J had responded almost instantly. She also agrees that this is not like him at all to get upset like this, she’s even known him longer than I have. He’s my best friend and I hate to see it like this. I know what caused it just don’t understand why he’s being like this.",03Nov2019,1

103,"Hi! I wanted to talk a little about myself today, ive been going through a tough time for a while now.
To get started heres a bit about myself, I am 13 years old, I like to draw cats and play minecraft, I am autistic, I am very lonely and have had a hard time coping with it.
My school life isnt the greatest either, i havent been doing my school work with the other people in my year group, i go to a special area with kids for special needs althroughout my day.
I used to be able to handle being with the everyone else, but when i was around 11 and a half i just stopped being able to cope with everything, i had constant anxiety and paranoia wherever i was and i started to feel really really depressed.
Alot of the time i just thought to myself, ""The other kids arent like this, so why am i?"" But everytime that thought came into my head i just thought that ""But im not the other kids.""
I never really was the most social person, i had only a few friends but when i started to open up, they only listened for so long until they just stopped talking completely. I felt really alone during this time period, but, meanwhile, i was talking to my internet friends.
My internet friends have helped me so much through the past year, i dont know what i would do without them but... i just feel weird all the time, ive not fully gotten over the feelings i had, im still terribly anxious all the time and the feeling of being depressed still hasnt left me, i dont know who i can trust anymore. Im worried that if i still vent to these people i trust, that theyll leave me too.
I honestly feel so alone.",03Nov2019,1
104,"I’m a 23 f, I just started my first “big person” job in August. I was hopeful and excited for the prospects: new job, making money (not a lot tbh), moved 10 hrs from home. Now I’m not sure this job is for me. I got my bachelors degree in marine biology, my goal was to help animals, or make a difference in marine ecosystems. I’m looking constantly for different jobs and have not come up with much. I’ve been thinking of maybe going back and getting an associates degree in veterinarian technology. That would mean moving back home, but it feels like I’d be back tracking. Any advice?",03Nov2019,2
105,"(/r/Showerthoughts redirected me to here) I feel that the term ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions"" is overused a lot to excuse bad behavior or as a distraction from the fact that much of the really bad shit that happens are due to direct bad actions, not ""do gooders"" or whatever.

I understand that the sentiment is directed at bad laws or social customs or bandaid fixes that get thrown out there, and sure there are times when those things backfire. There are people who may use those things to excuse their own bad behavior, but the root cause is generally them wanting to do the bad shit anyways.

At the end of the day, if you take all the Holloween candy, you're an asshole. If you abuse the unlimited return system at a store and not use it when you really need to so they rescind the policy for everyone, you're a dickhead. If you offer to help someone in need, but put impossible conditions on it, you're a jerk. If you start a non-profit charity to line your own pockets, you're just another greedy scumbag.",03Nov2019,2
106,"Super weird thing is happening. Growing up I loved watching a good shoot em up type action film with my parents. Obviously I’ve always hated gorey/horror films to *some degree* but not excessively sensitive. I don’t know if this is related but: two years ago I went through a trauma (nothing violent/physical happened to me or anyone else tho) and now I’m far too empathetic to watch even the lamest of action films. I can’t watch comedies because they’re all too self deprecating and I feel too bad for them, I can’t watch any action because I feel too sorry for the people who got shot, or wonder if the bad guy has unresolved trauma, or I worry about the kids of the bodyguard who’s just been killed. Like, literally everything. I even worry about the people who have to clean up the dead bodies and if they’ll be traumatised or not. It’s a fake film, it’s not even REAL and I worry about this. I can’t stand any form of violence anymore. Any time there’s a fight, or a gun, I gasp and look away. I hate seeing violence on any level.

Me and my boyfriend watched a documentary on prisons. I paused the show and spent 20mins discussing how wrongful it was for the people to be kept up in cells and how bad it must be for their mental health and how if I was in charge I would try and prevent this etc etc etc. Why do I have to think so deeply and not just watch? It feels as though everything is effecting me.

I can’t watch any nature programmes anymore either, I feel too sorry for the animals that die. Like, I will cry. David Attenborough documentaries? I used to watch them back to back. Now I can’t stand to see how climate change has effected the little baby birds. 

My boyfriend told me someone from his work accidentally killed someone in a motorbike accident. I sobbed so hard because I was worried if it kept him up at night, or if his life was ruined, and how he would cope in jail, then I started feeling equally sorry for the man that died and how his family are coping. This kept me up at night.

I am increasingly sensitive to things that aren’t even real. They’re just actors. My boyfriend tried showing me John Wick. I couldn’t stop talking about how horrible I felt that I lost his wife or how tired John Wick must be or how XYZ,etc etc. Then we had to stop the film because it got more and more violent. 

Everyone is empathetic as human beings, but mine is becoming more and more of a massive issue. I hope this does go away, so I can go back to mindlessly watching dumb films without *thinking* too hard",03Nov2019,2
108,"Im staying at my sister’s house rn, fell asleep on the couch in the living room last night at like 6 pm is, woke up at 7.30 pm to find my sister and her friends chilling and talking in the dining room (adjacent). Of course I felt embarrassed because me sleeping was basically full display to everyone, so I said, hey, sorry for using the couch, do you guys want to sit here? To which they politely declined. They made small talk to me afterward, and even though I realized I was a bit awkward, I felt like I was giving, like, reasonable answers? After they went home my sister said I was hella awkward and should engage more in the convo. Soooo... how do I raise my social skills?",03Nov2019,1
109,"And by that,I mean my fucking weight and the fact that food seems to be the bane of my fucking existence.  


Nothing like finishing up a great day than by having your dad ORDER you to get on the scale...and then when you get frustrated about your parents nagging you about your weight and you get frustrated,your parents all of a sudden think you're some dangerous nutter who will kill them in their sleep! fun! **/S**  


....Needless to say,this shit(and shit before then) has led me to the following conclusions,because this shit isn't gonna work anymore:  


1-I am pretty much done with Florida altogether now(I'm getting the fuck outta here,even if that means enlisting...)  


2-I almost felt suicidal today...but then I realized that that would be so fucking dumb;I don't need to off myself because of shitty parents.  


3-North Korea always acts like they're ready to die,but I guess North Korea gonna North Korea and Korea gonna Korea,so I guess I will head for Japan...but not without stocking up on supplies/getting a HAZMAT suit,etc.If I am gonna enter the dragon's lair,so to speak,I'm damn sure gonna be prepared.  


4-I need to make my weight loss efforts FAR more effective(my parents seem to think that reaming you about your weight is gonna change the fact that you're fat...I already know,and it's not like the weight is gonna grow legs and walk off me!)  


  
And that's it...  


God am I glad I'm going to the shrink tomorrow. How the hell do you deal with living with shitty parents? How do you do it WITHOUT thinking time and again of offing yourself because of their bullshit?   


And before you go and say ""Oh,they only mean well!""  


Well,how about said parents VERBALLY ABUSING you and emotionally abusing for shit that you effectively A.can't do anything about at the moment and B.ARE taking steps to rectify!  


Parents aren't saints. And some parents are on some next level bullshit. Parents CAN,WILL AND DO fuck up their kids. Just because YOUR parents have been cool does not mean that all parents are like that.  


I swear,my parents think that everything can be solved by screaming at it,cussing at it and abusing it in some way.  


Shit,if you ask me...It's bullshit that I was harping on and on about North Korea..it almost feels like getting nuked would be a fucking improvement.  


TL;DR: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW3PFC86UNI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW3PFC86UNI)

And parents can be fucked up too.  


Word of advice:If you are in your 30s and still living with your parents:I would suggest doing whatever you can to get away from them:Enlisting,trucking,whatever...especially if your parents are abusive.  


Living with your parents in your 30s:Hell. No other way to describe it...Oh,and fucking yourself over(taking the wrong damn degree and not taking the Job search seriously) is hell too.",03Nov2019,0
