2,"I can look back on my life and I'm not sure if I've ever actually felt loved. 

I mean I think my mom loved me. 

I think my husband loves me but he's done a lot to prove he doesn't. He told me he was never committed to me until very recently. 

Everyone else has pretty much opted out of my life. I think I'm a good person. I love my family and try to do the right thing. I try to better myself and take care of my home and family. I don't know what I'm doing wrong here.",13Nov2019,1
3,"I've had depression for about 3 years now...

I've always had issues regarding social skills and was always shy. I never really got out there in life and learned the social skills I needed later. Maybe partialy becaude of my Dad who left me and my sister. Maybe partialy because of other things.

I could handle staying in my room all day. Just playing videogames with friends online, never going out with them (and if I did go out with friends, I always felt left out) Over the years I got pushed further away from friend groups and now I am feeling so lonely.

Since 3 years ago I have had a shortness of breath and a pain in my chest. Since three years it hasn't gone away. I am finally now seeing a doctor who can help me with a program at a specialized hospital. But this pain has sent me on a downwarsd spiral of negativity. Together with the lack od social life and skills it has made me depressed.

The emotioms I feel now are only led by pain. Sometimes I feel pain has become an emotion. But anger has recently been coming up inside me. I'm angry because I'm powerless. And I always feel regret and sadness when thinking about the past. Listening to old songs and watching childhood movies make me realize how good life was then, and how bad it is now.

I really want to life, but I need help. I need rest. I need time.

tl;dr: pain and lack of social life have led me down a spiral of negativity and I now have had depression for 3 years",13Nov2019,1

7,"Throwaway because I feel ashamed of this...

I have lied about so many things, many small things and some big things... I feel so ashamed for it, I hate the fact that I do it but if difficult to stop because I do not want to get hurt... but I want to become a truthful person. I want to be someone who can be trusted, and someone people can rely on. But I feel that this is preventing me, it would be fake if I was to be this person... Am I too far gone? Am I stuck to be this way forever? And can I ever be trusted after this?",13Nov2019,1

9,"I'm a pretty outgoing person so whenever I'm left on my own for long periods of time or don't hang out with a group, I always feel depleted and my anxiety skyrockets. As soon as I meet up with my friends or something, though, it immediately goes away. I don't know how to combat this because I don't really want to rely on human interaction to keep me going because it feels like I'm needy and clingy and I don't want to come off that way.

How do I combat this? This time of year is hard because everyone (including myself) is super stressed out with college work and it's hard for me to get off campus and hang out. Should I try and meet up more with my friends and study with them or something like that so I'm getting my social interaction in and also getting work done? (I do get more work done when I'm around others working so that wouldn't be an issue on my side.)",13Nov2019,1

i do have a history with depression so ik the change in seasons hasn’t helped. 
every weekday i wake up at 5:30am and get to work at 6, then i come home at noon. 

i normally play piano/drums, have lunch, and watch something for a couple hours. i want to stay productive and happy but i crash around 3 and end up getting depressed and laying in bed for the rest of the day/night. if i didn’t live with my parents idk if i’d even eat. 

my weekends are good but sunday nights i dread repeating the cycle. 

it’s getting worse and i dont want to end up shutting down.

17,"My brain thinks of the strangest things...

But anyway...

There are seven characters in the Roman Numeral system: I, V, X, L, C, D and M. Every number greater than 39 contains an L, C, D or M, none of which can be written upside-down. V also cannot be written upside down, so any number ending in 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 is also non-invertable, that leaves numbers ending in 1, 2, 3, 9 and 0. There are only 3 numbers below 40 that end in 0: 10, 20 and 30 all of which are perfectly symmetrical and make the same number when inverted (X, XX, XXX). Any consecutive ""I""s in a number must be at the end, so they also cannot be inverted. This would mean all numbers ending in 2 or 3. Any number (below 40) with consecutive ""X""s must have them at the beginning, so all numbers from 20 to 39 are non-invertable. That leaves numbers below 20 that end in 1 or 9. There are only 4: 1(I), 9(IX), 11(XI), and 19(XIX). 1 and 19 are symmetrical, so that only leaves 9 and 11; 9(IX) upside-down is 11(XI).

Probably no-one cares, but whatever.",13Nov2019,1
18,"It was Christmas break of 2007, I was in the 8th grade and my friend Jake got Guitar Hero 3 for Christmas. 

Jake invited me over to rock out and stay the night so I did. When I arrived he told me we would be staying 

in his sisters bedroom because she was spending the night at her friends house that night and she has a bigger tv. 

Jake's sister was a hot high school senior named Heather. I had a crush on her since I met Jake in the 6th grade 

and thought about her almost every time I jerked off. 

So we go upstairs to her room, As soon as he opened the door the smell of sweet perfume hit my nose and the floor 

was covered in clothes, and lots of pretty panties and bras. I lay down my bag and we sit on Heather's bed and he 

hands me the plastic guitar. As I play ""Talk Dirty to Me"" on normal and miss nearly half the notes, I glance over and 

see a laptop and camera laying on her desk. A voice from within told me there was nudes of Heather on those devices. 

After I play a few songs I let Jake show me up and brag. I stare at a pair of pink panties wrapped up in Heather's volley ball shorts laying next to my foot. My stomach starts to tingle while I think of how nice it would be to take a good wiff of them. I dare Jake to try the hardest song on expert difficulty so he would be too focused to notice me snatch up the panties. So he loads up ""Through the Fire and Flames"" I snatch the panties and put them in my pocket.

A couple hours pass and Jake ask if I want a pizza and I stay in the room to ""practice Before I Forget""After he left I quickly rush over to the desk. I start up the laptop and it has a password. FUCK. I look up at the pictures and post it notes she had on the mirror above the desk. I try several passwords, 1989, her band posters with her volleyball number at the end. And a message pops up that says 1 more attempt before being locked out. I felt like a bomb squad member that had one last chance before the bomb goes off. I notice she had ""Heathermarie17"" scribbled on one of the post it notes and type it in. IT FUCKING WORKED. 

As soon as I seen the desktop I open file explorer and start digging through the photos as I take deep sniffs of the dirty panties. I keep scrolling until I find selfies of her laying in bed... and BOOM there is the nudies. I gasp and my eyes widen up as I witness top notch spank material. I'm talking panties and bra, all the way to standing squeezing her boobs, bent over with her hand on her ass, spreading her vagina laying with her legs wide open... As many times IPictured her bubble butt and thick thighs while I jerked off I never would have imagined such a nice body.I must add these to my mobile wank bank!

So I pull my mp3 out of my pocket and remove the sd card and toss it on the desk and insert her sd card into my mp3. I wanted to leave no trace of saving the nudes to the laptop. I merge the photos over to my mp3 on file explorer. The door opens and I quickly open internet explorer. Jake asked what I was doing I told him I was checking my Myspace. He starts playing Guitar Hero and I finish my task and rejoin Jake with my rock hard boner tucked between my legs.  A few minutes later the door opens, It was Heather and her hot friend, I had two pillows in my bed I would hump As I fantasized a 3 some with these two.

The first thing Heather does is bend over and pick up her vollyball shorts and shake them with a puzzled look on her face. She starts looking through her other dirty clothes and looks up at me, I turn red faced and stare at the tv. She puts a few clean clothes from her dresser in a bag then walks with her friend to sit at the desk. I then remember my dumb ass left MY sd card laying on the desk and HERS in my mp3 player. I quickly say ""hey where trying to play a game and you all are disturbing us"" she says ""shut up this is my room, and I am just making some room on my camera for more pictures."" I start to panic as she put the sd card into the camera and plugged it up, I had pictures of her and many other hot girls from school I took from their Myspace profiles on that card. 

I didn't know what the fuck to do. As soon as she opens file explorer I see my name in the top left hand corner and consider running out of the room or faking a seizure or some shit. She says ""why is there green day songs on here? and clicks on a photo thumb nail. Her friend puts her hand over her mouth like she seen a ghost. I lean over and see her clicking through mirror selfies of herself, other girls, and the nudes. She says ""I don't know why the hell Amanda's Myspace pics are on here."" and then says ""Brandon's mp3?! what the fuck?""

 Heather turns around and looks at me with a disgusted face. ""why is your shit on my camera?"" with sweat rolling down my face I come up with ""I was fixing my mp3 on your laptop I don't know where those pictures came from"" she gets up and walks over to me and says ""let me see your mp3!"" I said ""no you will break it or something!"" She holds me down and starts reaching for my pocket. I fight as hard as I can and she manages to yank out the pink panties and mp3. 

Her jaw drops, she stares at the pair of panties in her hand. She throws the mp3 at the wall as hard as she could and starts screaming ""YOU LITTLE SICK ASS. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!!! JAKE GET YOUR FRIEND THE FUCK OUT! MOMMMMM COME HERE!!!"" 

So to end the story, Heather tells her parents and they call my mom and tell her to come pick me up. As her dad stares at me like he's going to beat the living shit out of me Heather's mom tells my mom the story. I lost my mp3, the most awesome nudes I have ever seen to this day, and from 8th grade to the end of high school I was known as ""not that Brandon, the creepy Brandon"" And never got the luxury of nude pics from any chicks I talked to.",13Nov2019,1

21,"2 years ago I made a post on this app looking for someone to talk too because I was going through a really rough time, this amazing girl messaged me and we talked all night, I mean we literally talked for 10 hours until I had to leave for work, we talked for a week non stop before we both realized we were in love (I know it sounds dumb) 

Ever since then we have talked on the phone and video call every single day, there probably hasn’t been a day in 2 years we haven’t talked on the phone for a minimum of 4 hours, we never run out of stuff to talk about, we truely are best friend

After 8 months of dating I finally got time to take a trip to see her (I live in the states while she lives in Canada) I stayed at her moms house with her (we’re both 20) i had the most amazing time ever, after those 3 weeks I knew she was the one, the entire time I was there I felt like I was on cloud9, we also got a hotel there and lost our virginity together, and it’s a moment I’ll never forget

We got engaged 4 months ago! I purposed to her in the parking lot at the airport, because I was to exited to wait

And after this semester in school she’s moving to me and will be getting married, her family unfortunately has not been very supportive but thankfully she’s a very determined girl lol

She truely has made everyday amazing and even when we argue we always apologize to each other very shortly afterwards, we even fall asleep on the phone together every single night because we both get anxiety being away from each other and we just feel so much more at peace knowing we’re right there, I’m so exited to Marry her, she is the best thing that’s ever happen to me and I’m so proud to call her mine",13Nov2019,1
22,"Today I was very obviously flustered and struggling to find something to wear that I was comfortable in and get out the door. You saw this and asked me if I was ok, “I don’t know” was my response because honestly I didn’t. You didn’t say anything after that, you just reached out and pulled me into a hug, you kissed my head, everything stopped. I forgot what I was even upset about, my breath steadied and everything was ok. 

You have never been a people person and you struggle a lot with comforting me in times of anxiety, we’ve been in countless fights because sometimes it just doesn’t feel like you care because you never learned how to show you did. That one simple hug was the best thing you’ve ever done to help me feel better, no words, no advice, just a hug, and I melted. You’re the only person on earth who can make me feel like that with just a hug, somehow your hug felt like a million words of comfort.",13Nov2019,1

24,"Let me start off by saying I'm not a confident man, I'm also extremely shy and I may not show it right away but I'm really self concious about how I look. Truth be told I'm mentally fragile and I tend to break down easily due to who my family is and the hell they bring me. I've told them this many times over the years and I get made fun of every single time. I remember at one point I told them about my stress eating... They laughed to the point tears rolled down their eyes. They think I'm weak and deep down inside I believe I am. But I'm trying to improve. I want to... No I need to so I can finally get the fuck out of here.

 At least I'm not having children and having a shit time raising them at 18 years old like they did with me. But back to the subject at hand...

 I am having a rough time with dating as of late and I told my family I finally have a date. Immediately I get made fun of. My confidence drops hard core. This is the first date I've been on in 10 months. I was excited but at the same time extremely nervous... To the point I was absolutely scared. But I'm still going through with this. 

Next I get dressed and I'm looking sharp but wouldn't you know it I get made fun of again asking if I really was gonna leave like how I was dressed. I was dressed ok I guess... Light blue shirt, brown belt, stone pants, and brown shoes. I'm not at all fashionable but I was proud of how I was dressed since I'm trying to figure out my style and I was pretty happy with myself. But nope my family decided to bum rush me and criticize my clothes... Confidence is completely gone and now I'm starting to feel really depressed.

They then ask me were am I going and I stay silent. They don't like that at all. So of course they make fun of me. I'm already in a depressed state and now I'm on the verge of a mental break down. I try to change my clothes as best as I can but I cant find anything that will match or fit properly since I've been losing weight. I message my date I'm not feeling too good and I have to cancel our time together... She thankfully is understanding and tells me she will be happy to reschedule. I'm happy shes cool with it but something deep down inside me says she hates me right now... I begin to cry and I feel so defeated. I wait till the house is empty (I live with them since finding an apartment in this city is extremely expensive) and I let out my sadness and while doing so I begin to stress eat. 

The nice clothes I had on got a bunch of greasy food on them and I take notice of that... I begin to hit the walls and my door in attempts to punish myself. I ended up breaking my door so I punish myself even more on the broken door until my right hand hurts from it. It currently hurts to move it but I do not care. I let everything out and now I'm just moping about like an empty shell. I can't talk because I hurt my throat in the yelling I did.

Tomorrow is another day. Tomorrow I put on a mask and pretend I'm happy with everyone. This is the 4th time my family has made me feel like this.

I want to die.

Reader if you think I'm a weak bitch you don't need to say it my family has you beat.

Reader if you think I'm a beta male... My family probably thinks I am too. I probably am. I'll suck your crusty ass toes bitch.

Reader if you think I am trying to grab attention you are mistaken. I am here to vent since I have no friends. My family doesn't make fun of that since they got their wish a decade ago. I'm all alone here.

I am defeated.

I'm almost 30 and I have nothing.

I ate 7000 calories in fast food. My heart is seriously trying to truck along. It hurts to breathe... A trooper my heart is. I wish it would stop.

Guys if you made it down here I just want to say I'm sorry for the way I type. My mind is all cloudy and I have no proper thought process right now. I wish I had some weed so I can go to sleep and recollect myself. I'm a broken man who is trying to fix himself up with glue. Typing my thoughts helps me regain myself since I'm not good at voicing my feelings. If for some odd reason you are worried about me... Don't. I'll be fine in due time I promise. Honestly there are times I think I am autistic from the way I behave sometimes. Wouldn't surprise me if I am truth be told...",13Nov2019,1
25,"When you do something for years and years you get better and better at it. I've had these thoughts long enough now to realize they're not my own but the mental illness but with each thought comes a feeling and with it a reaction and then an action.

Sometimes I feel what it's like to have a normal clear free mind briefly and I feel happiness like it's the first time i've ever felt it. These periods usually last up to a maximun of 45 minutes and happen only once every few days.

I hate being schizophrenic :(

A small part of me says I should seek help through my doctor and a mental health team, it could lead to medication which would mean I could be happy all the time. That would be so good, better than winning the lottery. I'd trade all the money in the world for that. I'm reminded that if I do that I could potentially mess up my life; i've worked so hard these past 3 years to get mentally stable and acquire a job -- I haven't done all that to just piss it up the fucking wall and go back to where I started in a hospital hoping for a miracle medication and that reminds me -- when I was in that hospital the psychologist asked me 'What do you hope for? What do you want to happen?' I replied it'd be nice if you could give me a medication that fixes everything ... But I don't think such a thing exists.

27,"I began to think that college wasn’t for me and that I wasn’t going to go to school on a couple of days which ended up messing my grades up for first quarter. I got the influence from most of my friends that said that they weren’t going to college and that I was going to go to trade school with them. 

I didn’t realize what trade really was and how I’m actually not interested into trade school at all. I found that I want to pursue a career in the technology field and I want to explore my life outside of DC/MD. I began to see how I almost became one of those stubborn teenagers that listen to their friends and influence what I heard from them.

This quarter, I’ve already gained more confidence in my work and have learned the ropes of a Senior in high school. I hope to achieve a 3.0+ cumulative GPA and score a good SAT score with the possibly of a full-ride scholarship! 

I also got back into debate recently. I began debate last year and hope to learn more about it this year.

Next weekend, I’m about to start self-learning Python a bit using tutorials instead of playing video games

I decided to do a 1 week break of video games and decided to catch back up on academics and my near future of college

29,"The whole thing seems a bit too good to be true, just like the old Sonic look seemed somehow even worse than the worst thing you could imagine a studio like Paramount coming up with. 

The old one seemed deliberately bad, not just misguided, and I think it was a marketing scheme to spark outrage that would get people talking about how terrible Sonic looked in the movie. Then they release this new trailer which is cut and edited very differently than the original, so it's not just the model that changed, and everyone loses their minds about how much of a victory this is for the fans.

I highly doubt anything like the first model could have been anything but a publicity stunt. Any focus group would reject that model whether they had heard of Sonic or not.

Anyways, take this for what you will, but it is rare to screw up something as simple as the look of a character as well known as Sonic to an Avatar the Last Airbender movie level of bad.",13Nov2019,1

31,"At the beginning of this year I had some relationship stuff blow up and ended everything. I was feeling really bad, and found a dude that encouraged me to do what I wanted, even though I was living in a situation that was pretty controlling. He was in an open relationship, and we started getting to know each other and let ourselves get a bit more emotionally attached than we had originally agreed upon. His girlfriend started to get jealous, so he ended things when she asked, and I let it sound like it wasn't a big deal to me.

As time went on I realized that I was hurt because I actually really liked the guy. He asked consent for EVERYTHING, which made him sexy as hell to me. We remained friends because we were in the same circles for a bit, and he's someone I am comfortable with so I asked him relationship-y questions when I started moving on, because I had been out of the game for 10 or so years before him.

He moved about an hour and a half away, so I made a habit of sending a text saying hey when I passed his neighborhood. And this weekend I was staying relatively close to him, and I sent that text and said I was going to be in the area for a few days when he asked what was up... well, his girlfriend broke up with him this weekend. He asked me out for drinks, and I said no. I was busy, and couldn't trust myself not to want to be sexual when I saw that he was hurting, and because of the nature of business that I was in the area for to begin with.

He headed to the bar and kept texting me. Telling me that his girlfriend asked him to stop seeing me, and that my boyfriend was really lucky because I'm awesome. I told him that anyone would be lucky to have him, but left it at that.

The next day I checked in with him, and he said that he wanted cuddles and to get high. I almost offered to come over and do that, but I knew better after what he said the previous night for sure. He told me that his girlfriend had come back to the apartment and I didn't hear anything from him after that.

I texted him super early in the morning telling him that I can't come over or go out for drinks because I still find him super sexy, and would love to be in his corner.

I got no response.

I felt like shit. He was ignoring me, and I had betrayed my boyfriend without him knowing it.

I went to a meditation class full of women. We did an exercise about things that we have been told through the years that still hurt. The lies that we tell ourselves are true, even though we know better. We all took turns talking about them with a partner, and we told the entire group one of them, and were given affirmations to work into our lives to flip them. We all cried, hard, real tears.

I told my partner about the interaction, and how I felt like shit. How I was upset that I gave this dude real estate in my mind. A few hours after that class, I blocked the dude's number and deleted his number from my phone and haven't looked back. I've been much more connected with my boyfriend, and I no longer feel like I'm tottering on the edge of the pool instead of swimming with him in it. I feel good about my decision, and I won't be looking to contact that other guy again. I am grateful for the lessons that he taught me, and for giving me new experiences, but I'm done.",13Nov2019,1

I put on this mask of false confidence. And I honestly started believing it was the real me, that I could be cool and good to the ones around me. But  I'm not. As time goes by, I get rejected and the mask fades away. And I turn back into the immature jackass I've always been.

38,It’s become obvious to me recently that friends aren’t my thing I guess they usually just stop talking to me eventually even if they act like they care a whole lot. My best friend even recently basically stopped talking to me someome who I asked to never leave n who told me I meant a lot to them. I’ve seen there lows n highs cried about seeing them as sad as I am and thought I genuinely might have a life long friend. But no as usual our conversations get shorter n shorter still we take weeks to talk n it’s just like well I guess that’s over again back to the being a lone thing. That’s the thing though I suck at making myself happy. I can rarely watch tv or play games I like by myself n actually be entertained without others it’s stupid I shouldn’t need others I use to be fine without others but I tried to open up more n now I’m here. Now I just suck at being a lone. I’d rather work 50-60 hours than stay at home all day just cause people are around even though I’m quite introverted n the job I have forced me to talk to strangers.

I always push away my friends because of this and when they see me again and act like nothing happened and when I try to get space from them to think they appear and let me have no time for myself because I’m in a majority of their classes at school. I feel like I can’t be truthful with them and I just act as though there’s nothing wrong. They do so many small things that add up and I think it’s just because my insecurities about myself and this  that really destroys my mind when I’m alone, I don’t know how they (the same person as before) do it but they make me feel like I’m an awful person in those situations. And my trust in people has been lower ever since they told me that about 70% of the people in my grade at school hate my guts and I don’t know if they told me the truth. I can’t really understand why so many people would hate me for no reason. I think the reason I haven’t really asked around is because I’m scared that they were lying and I lose my best friend that way but if it’s true then my self esteem will disappear. I really don’t wanna be alone again because my parents always say I need friends to survive the rest of high school. I don’t really know if my other friends would take me back because my supposed best friend pushed me away from them like they wanted me all to themselves because they are always insulting them. They keep doing stuff that gets approval from my parents which makes me unclear on what to do. This whole problem probably seems really childish but I really don’t know if I can trust them anymore. I’ve tried to not talk to them for a day but they were persistent and wouldn’t stop pestering me so it’s difficult for me to get a mental break.",13Nov2019,1

Now, we both fell apart during toxic relationships for about a year and now we are both single. 

We now have sex regularly and he's not dating anyone. Neither am I. We both tell each other ""I love you"" when we say goodbye, but it's not THE ""I love you.""

I'm afraid of scaring him off or the same response I got in 2009. But, we've been physical since then. I don't know what to do or how to say it. I'm paralysed with telling him this.

So here it is, to go down in obscurity on the internet forever. Yay! Thank you for running your eyes over this if you happen to click on this post, even by mistake.

I can't even seem to work up the energy to game.

When I do complete a little bit of study at home, I feel like a piece of shit for not doing more or starting earlier in the day. 
I feel like I should give myself a break, but if I keep taking ""breaks"" like I have been, I'll never reach my career change goals.

It wasn't like this before. I didn't feel as ""sad"" and ""down"" a few months ago. I really wonder if it has something to do with the seasons... or if it's just because I am living my life in mediocrity.

I feel like I'll never get a better job. I feel like I'll never be able to afford a house or retire, and just be working into my 70s until I lose my job and become homeless and die a few years later. I feel like I'll never be able to get married and have a family, even though I want to in the future.

If I could at least pull a career change and make enough money to safely retire in the future, I think I could deal with being alone for the rest of my life. But I can't deal with the awful reality of being a broke spinster working a job I absolutely hate to survive even into my 60s and 70s...

But.  


Life was not easy and I definitely wasn't born or raised to have a head start in life. I grew up in a small village  Europe and my parents ran their business. With the economic crisis everything collapsed and we had to remigrate to our country of origin more to the north. This means that as a young teen I had to switch lives completely and leave all of my life-long friends behind. At that point we lived in poverty.  


I got my first job at 15 while also going to school. I started busking at some point and could make some money of my own playing music on the streets. As a busker I have had the cops called on me for no good reason (I had a license), my personal data shared with unauthorized 3rd parties (as a minor), eggs thrown at me, water thrown over me, I have even been sexually assaulted in broad daylight.  


My father belittled and me constantly, I didn't feel safe. And nobody believed me. I was all my fault. He got diagnosed with an illness, and he used that to excuse his behaviour, and I was supposed to feel bad for him. This turned out to be the main cause of why I became depressed. I was in therapy and on medication for 2 years.  


So I go to college now. But no funding and no scholarships. Everything is a loan. I expect to start my career with 50.000 in debt. When I graduate I will also be kicked out of where I live now, and housing in my country is a nightmare.

71,"Hello, I'm a Canadian High School student in grade 12 (grade 13 rather) and I'm repeating my chemistry course in hopes of getting a better mark. 

The Problem:

So, as mentioned earlier, I'm repeating my chemistry course. However, my school made a new double credit course called biochem that was supposed to be ""easier"" than taking biology and chemistry separately.  Now, I already have my biology credit (87%) but I decided to take the biochem course instead of the chemistry course on its own thinking that my knowledge of biology would help me with my chemistry mark in this course. However, that's totally not the case! The course is taught by 2 teachers, a chemistry teacher and a biology teacher. 

The Biology Teacher:

The biology teacher is pretty good, I like her. She's easy to relate to, gives good advice, makes the class fun and relatively easy. Sure, in her class we learn a slight bit more than we did in my biology class last year, but her information is generally straight forward and she takes her time to make sure we understand her lessons. She doesn't assign too many crazy long labs or anything and though she is not the best marker, she does not mark terribly either. Her tests are not too long and she lets us write them for an extra period of time given we are not done. My mark in her course is currently the same as my mark from last year which is unfortunate but expected given my situation with my chemistry teacher. Am I saying this teacher can't improve her part of the course in any way? Ofc not! If she just stuck to the exact teaching requirements of the course (the information I learned last year) and nothing more, I would have had a much higher mark but I'm also fine with my mark where its at and the information isn't too different from what I learned last year (I still have all my teachers' websites from last year for lesson reference).

My Chemistry Teacher:

This teacher straight up sucks. I absolutely hate her, I don't even know where to start. She always gives us labs to hand in a day before/after a test or to hand in on the same day of a big project - keep in mind, the teacher is the one assigning her labs, tests and projects on the same day. Sometimes my biology teacher convinces her to delay the due date by a day to let us study but generally, my chemistry teacher gives us TERRIBLE due dates for her assignments. We have an ISP for every single unit worth 5% of our bio and chem mark and though there's biology questions on this ISP, my biology teacher gives us very clear instructions for them and makes them easy to complete. The questions on this ISP that my chemistry teacher writes are always terribly structured, very hard to understand and include very little context. On our last ISP, the entire class literally guessed what to write for the chemistry portion because the questions just made no sense (this ISP was also based on us building a gel electrophoresis which is something we shouldn't even be doing until we get to university). Furthermore, the teacher teaches us things we're supposed to learn in university rather than in high school, I literally don't remember anything from last year vs what she's teaching us now. She made us learn some university level quantum, she gave us an entire unit that we didn't even do last year, and now for our current unit, thermochem (my favourite unit from when I took gr12 chemistry) makes absolutely no sense to me because she's added so much extra information to it and messed around with the format to a way which only she uses and it just confuses me now. Furthermore, this teacher teaches us chemistry for 2 periods straight EVERY day. She takes the time we're supposed to learn biology in, and turns it to a chemistry lesson to the point where my biology teacher only teaches once every few days. During her 2 period lessons, when the class doesn't understand what we're learning she keeps going on the newer concepts nonetheless (such as with when we learned quantum). She rushes through her lessons and makes so many mistakes through them, the other day her calculations on the slides she was presenting to us had at least 8 mistakes and she was reading the information right off the board because she had a lack of preparation - her excuse was that she didn't sleep enough because she made the slides the night before as this was her first time teaching the biochem course. The teacher herself is very irresponsible, heartless and incosiderate in my opinion, she also gives the vibe that she doesn't like most of us. Even on her tests, they're very long and she doesn't give extra time on them. On my last test, If I had an extra 10 min, I would have gotten a high 80 (I got a bare 80); however, she didn't give any of us extra time other than one person which she likes. Also, this course assigns us SO MUCH homework. I'm telling you, at least 7 pages of work each day + a lab due every other day - it's like our teachers (most of the work comes from the chem teacher tho) think that biochem is the only course we have. I have physics, advanced functions and biochem this semester and I never have any time to do any coursework for anything other than biochem. My chem mark last year was an 83, now its a 78 - lower than what I had last year! Every time someone drops out of the class, the teacher gets really mad at us but she's pushing us too much! &amp; Yes, everyone I've talked to in my class agrees with my statement and we just have no idea what to do, some are considering taking a gap year.

My Current Marks (Which Would Have Been Higher If It Weren't For Chem):

Physics - 85

Advanced Functions - 90

Chemistry - 78

Biology - 87

  
And no, I do not hate chemistry. I actually used to LOVE it. In gr11, I had a 97 in chemistry.

If anyone is considering taking a biochem course in high school, I have one word for you: DON'T.

I want to get into university programs that require a high 80 average and I have no idea what to do because biology is likely to drop soon. So is physics since I won't have time to do the homework because of my biochem homework.

Welp, gotta go do more biochem homework, thanks for reading.",13Nov2019,1
72,"I am a 29 year old male working in the financial sector as a quant. I am relatively successful on paper and I make about $150k all-in. I did a Ph.D. in a technical field because I originally thought I wanted to be a professor. I like the math and programming, but I don't like the stuffy corporate environment. I make too much to consider other options given my $100k in student loan debt. 

I am happily married and I have a 1 year old who I love spending time with. I just bought a house in the fall and aside from the expense, I'm enjoying the process of doing little projects with my hands to improve the place. 

All that said, I have anxiety and worsening depression. I've been on 20 mg prozac for about a year. It worked well at first, but has stopped being effective over the past 4 months or so. My doctor wants to double it to 40 mg per day. I am reluctant about this because how am I to know that it won't just stop working again and then also be harder to come off of due to my increased tolerance for it? 

I have been to multiple therapists, some have been helpful, others not so much. My primary problem seems to be a 'void' due to what I would refer to as the absurdism of the human condition. The fact that we seek out meaning in a world with inherently no meaning. I understand the futility of my obsession with this, but I can't seem to move past it. It's a black cloud over every day and every thing I do.

I know that my apathy / nihlism isn't good for my wife and baby, but I'm not sure how to address it. I am afraid of increasing the prozac, because it doesn't address the real problem. I am also reluctant to go to therapy because it costs me $120 per session and it may or may not even work. Can anyone offer some advice?",13Nov2019,1

Ex: my father is prescribed kolonopin for sleep, he would see the holistic doctor to figure out why he isn’t sleeping naturally rather than just prescribing meds to make him sleep. 

I take the following supplements: ferrofood (1 when i wake up 1 before i go to sleep) to help with my iron level, GTA (1 every other morning) for my thyroid, trace minerals B12 (1 every morning) and viranon ( 2 when I wake up 2 before i go to sleep). I also am on 50mg of sertraline and a continuous birth control. I asked my holistic doctor if it was okay to take the supplements so early in the morning on an empty stomach and she said yes it’s fine all the supplements are made from food anyways. 

The other morning after taking my supplements, I went outside to hit the bong with my boyfriend. I hit the bong like normal coughed for a little bit and then puked up all my supplements. That was the first time I had ever puked up just my supplements, I just thought it was bc I hit the bong to hard. This morning on my way to my chemistry class, I was drinking my hot tea as normal and then I started feeling my saliva start to puddle up in my mouth.

I fcked up on the registration part that altho i did pass for my 2 chosen courses, bc of a fck up, i was not allowed anymore to take the one that i really wanted. I also dropped a subject bc i was failing it but could have passed it if only i saw the TWO BACKPAGES.

Also, got almost thrown out of the university with a case, because i was accused of cheating (prof thought i was letting a friend copy my activity). Also, i'm also injured right now. I dislocated my shoulder in PE because of unnecessary competitiveness during a simple game and now i stuck with an arm sling unable to write for 2 weeks and the finals is already 3 weeks from now (I'm so fcked).

94,"The first time I heard of a gender reveal party in the early 2010s. I thought it was a really weird concept then, and my opinion has not changed since. I'm fortunate to be married to a woman who also thinks they're silly. I've wondered why I dislike them so much.

I finally thought about it yesterday after (a.) a close friend (almost family) had a gender reveal party and (b.) there was coincidentally an /r/nottheonion post on the topic. 

And here's what I came up with and I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way. This is something you can say anonymously but never I person because half of America seems to have gender reveals these days... So here it goes. 

I have a happy life. But gender reveal parties are quite literally depressing to me. Soul-sucking. 

It's a stark reminder that when it comes down to it, one cares about the sex of your baby. Meaning no one cared that much about the details of *my* babies. We pretend to care because we're polite. But it's not something that changes our day or even our hour or even affects us 45 seconds after the conversation ends. I mean, of course that's true, but you don't think about things like that all the time. Gender reveals are one of those things that, for me, lay that harsh reality bare.

For self-reflecting, introspective but generally happy people like me, gender reveal parties are a stark reminder that most people really don't care about you that much. It's soul-sucking. It makes me and people like me remember how separate and isolated we are, which is the exact opposite of what the goal of a party should be. It's a terrible pretense for a party. 

It's like being overly excited about corporate rah-rah bullshit, pretending things are more exciting than they actually are. But all they do is serve as a reminder of how mundane life is. The gender of a baby is one such thing. 

I mean that literally, the biological gender of a baby is just a  thing. It matters a ton to the parents but very little to anyone else when It comes down to it. Like, really, whether even your *best* friend has a boy or girl ultimately makes zero difference to you when you think it through. ""Your friend's baby"" is just ""your friend's baby"" five minutes after gender reveal. 

**Gender is neither something to celebrate nor keep a secret... The baby itself is what is worth celebrating.** Celebrate your baby, not its gender, with your loved ones. So many things bother me about it.

I'm sure I've offended 75% of humanity with this post and maybe I'm the only one who thinks this way. Regardless I got it off my chest!

**tl;dr:** Many people might care about your baby, so celebrate the baby. Whether that baby is a boy or girl ultimately makes no difference to anyone. Celebrate the thing people care about (the baby) rather than something people don't really care about 30 seconds after they hear it (boy vs. girl). The biological gender of the baby is just a fact your loved ones absorb absorb and then move on with life. It's not a good topic for a party and pretending otherwise is a depressing reminder of the mundane nature of life. So please do the world a favor and don't throw one, you're probably depressing a nonzero number of your loved ones.",13Nov2019,1
95," Re-posted as was prohibited from CasualConversation. 

There's a lot of context. I'll try to condense it, however.

I'm nineteen as of tomorrow. My mum just gave me a beautiful watch, while her boyfriend gave a key ring which, albeit simple, has a sentimental value attached to it nonetheless. Needless to say, I'm incredibly appreciative.

Despite this, I'm one of the most selfish human beings. My family hasn't been the most functional, with my mum being a gambler, my deceased dad an alcoholic. There's been a lot of emotional turmoil between myself, the youngest, and my three older sisters. Needless to say, we're a family who bonds over toxicity, i.e. he-said-she-said — and it makes me absolutely sick to my stomach to say this.

I've said a lot of awful stuff about my family, specifically my mum, after internalising a lot of anger and hurt from either things they've said and done. This wasn't fair of me, however. I've always been angry at the fact that my mum equates money and materialism to love, and her inability to understand mental health, but that's the way in which she was raised, so what gave me the right to judge her? I'm only just coming to realise this. I feel absolutely awful.

But when she tells me she loves me, I don't feel it. I'm not deserving of her, or anybody else's, love.

I'm an awful person.",13Nov2019,1

Now, almost 11 years later I'm feeling that again when I hear Dexter talk about his dark passenger.

98,"Ever since I was a child, I've been terrified of error screens. Whenever one of those popped up, I could feel by heart pounding and I'd be on the verge of a panic attack. My parents thought it was silly, couldn't quite understand how someone could be scared of something as silly as an error screen I suppose. But the sight of a message saying that a disk had failed to load, a disk had not been inserted properly, a game had crashed or an error had simply occurred was and is one of the scariest things to me. I've read some posts on various websites and online forums about this seemingly unknown fear. Most explanations imply that the only reason we are so scared of those pop ups are because they are unexpected and we are usually concentrated on a game when they show up. But even watching YouTube videos of Wii s, Playstations or computers crashing scare me, even though I expect them to show up. I looked them up myself after all.

Married my High School Sweetheart we met when we were 16 and 15 and decided to have a baby so our parents could not stop us from seeing each other. We have now been together 25 years, we decided to sneak off and get married while we were in Vegas, Our wedding anniversary is 9-11-2001 we were married at 2:30am the morning of the attacks.

I never choose things to do with my family, I am always put on the spot and always reply with ""what would you like to fo"" I am taking a more pro-active roll in this to take my wife out and such. We have had huge fights about it in the past, Its hard, I really don't know what to do, and all I really want is her to have fun.

I don't like talking to people, really day in and day out I only speak to 5 people at most, and more often than not its closer to 3 people in a day, wife and kids. I'm no good at small talk and many times I am sure I come across as rude because I don't spend long amounts of time talking to people I don't know.

I know its wrong but I really don't have much empathy for people, and this frustrates my wife, (but I am getting better at faking empathy)

I don't have any friends, ever since college they have all faded away and have all lost contact. I don't have Facebook, I have never wanted it.

Have not been to the movies since Dark Knight Rises, that was really the last new movie I have seen.

My wife got a new smart phone for me, and I have no clue how to use it because until yesterday 9/12/19 I had a flip phone that I only used to text or make calls. But I just got an LG Aristo something or other and am trying to figure it out.

I would choose to stay home most times, not because I have some pressing thing that needs to be done or watch TV (I don't watch TV much only the News) I just would rather be home.

If I do go out on my motorcycle I pilot way too fast many times.

108,"I would be fine with any old phone, but the qwerty keyboard would probably make writing texts quicker.

2019 seemingly started off great. I got into a relationship, was meeting a bunch of new people and was doing okay in uni. My relationship started on Tinder, which made me convince all my friends that online dating is great, they should all try it. My best friend even got into a Tinder relationship on her own. The issue was that I didn't really like my boyfriend, and he didn't like me that much either. Sure, we had both found each other to be fun people with great personalities, but he wanted to prove to others that he was over his ex, and I desperately wanted to fall in love and make a relationship work. He was really good looking and that meant a lot of showing off on Instagram. Finally the people from high school would see a different successful aspect of my life. Who cares if they couldn't care less?

Anyways since we didn't have that much in common, I adapted my personality and interests to my boyfriend's, and when the relationship inevitably ended in a ""bleh"" kind of way, I was left wondering who I was as a person.

A childhood friend once told me that every time she imagines my future, she sees me in front of a computer with big, nerdy glasses on, handling some nerdy IT business. I would be a loner still, just like I was back then, but blessed be, I would still be really smart and nerdy. 

Obviously a nerd was everything I never wanted to be, so I dropped out of engineering school, started law school and have become one of the non nerds. Great. 

I was really active on social media for really long. I think I enjoyed the illusion of actually having friends and contacts. I would see someone post a story of them working for some organization and I'd say ""Great, now I know a person working for \_\_\_"", as if it had any significance for me whatsoever. 

So after a long time contemplating, I realized that I had at some point become dumb. I couldn't do basic calculations anymore and my brain would bug at texts with more than two sentences. My attention span was that of a goldfish and I genuinely just slept and browsed social media. I decided it was time for a break and deleted instagram.

I stopped pretending to be outgoing, extroverted. I stopped chasing opportunities to travel and chasing people to tag in my photos. I could stop with the theatre because there was nobody watching anymore. My role in this weird Big Brother Show we live in, no matter how minor it had been, had ended for good. 

Since then I can honestly say that although still not smart, I feel like I have recovered some basic human functions. I can move my limbs again and I don't collapse after climbing one stair. Also my vocabulary range has improved and doesn't consist solely of the word ""like"" anymore. 

It was a great decision, but I still spent up to eight hours on my phone every day. Youtube was very captivating and watching videos about philosophy and science made me feel that I was educating myself. Reddit was just great too. I found a whole comunity dedicated to not surfing the internet and spend a third of my day reading their tipps and tricks. Eventually my days became as mundane as they get, without anything really ever happening. For a change, and for the sake of finally passing some exams, I turned my phone off. 

All of a sudden my days became much longer. Instead of constantly absorbing all sorts of information in huge amounts, I would read one book or study for one subject, and then I would rest. With my phone turned off, I have accomplished more in terms of studying than I have in the past two months, and It's only been three days. 

The problem is, Black Friday is approaching, making the new iPhone 11 with the spicy camera affordable for me. In 2020 I will be traveling a whole lot and I wanted to download Instagram again. I wanted to experience that imaginary comeback of all of a sudden returning with a glow up and living in a different part of the world. The problem is that if I do that, I am pretty sure I will lose myself again and start chasing that generic lifestyle social media is forcing upon me, or else I'll feel very inferior to all the extroverted world travelers on there. Also I don't really want that comeback situation anymore, but I've craved it for so long, that I fear that if I miss out this time, I will regret it. 

There is not really a deep point to this post. I just had to tell someone, but right now there is no one in my life who I could discuss my social media caused melancholy with, and try to get them to convince me to not go back to that place.

110,"Im 19 F and the past year I’ve been hooking up with different people and having fun. Through it I have realized my problems with love and sex, but regardless of what the outcome is I always loved the sex and in general it was always a positive time with whomever I did it with.

To give some background with this situation, I recently had to stop going to therapy. I have depression and PTSD, but its not bad enough that I can’t function, but bad enough that I have mental breakdowns once a week that can get really bad. Therapy cost too much and I had to stop right when making progress. I’ve been trying to get help for my mental state since 13 and I just felt fucking hopeless. Im commuting in college right now, working 20 hours at a part time job, and doing art commissions on the side. In between all of those I just have a seemingly astronomical amount of homework to do, and I just want to quit, I genuinely do. So mental illness and the stress of a 10,000 education (just one year mind you) is the backdrop for this situation.

So the delivery driver for my job asked for my number and after texting a bit he asked if we wanted to be FWBs and I was way too busy to see him so I denied. He lived an hour away and I didn’t know until texting him. He offered to pick me up, and after we could smoke, then he’d take me back home in the morning. I obliged. Its half because I do risky and impulsive things like this a lot, I like the fun of it but also I had the mentality of “I’m not getting better anyway, and everything is shit right now. If there is even a possibility of fun I’ll do it”. So I did.

This gets graphic.

The drive there was fine, we were kind of vibing. Once we get there though he changes and wants to fuck immediately. Everyone else I have been with eased into it so I knew I got myself into something bad. He told me to suck him off (I’m not good at it, plus he is huge) and I did the best I could. He forced my head down, and despite gagging a lot kept doing it. I was hating it but an hour away from home and too deep in, I just kept going. He couldn’t get hard so most positions just failed so I kept needing to suck him off to get him hard again. He kept pushing my head down and insisting that I go deeper and tears from gagging kept running down my face. It was the only time I’ve ever had sex and it was innately degrading. He made me squat on his groin and I haven’t worked out in forever so my legs burned and gave out. He was pushy once more and ushered me on top again. 

Afterwards we smoked and I just zoned the fuck out thinking why was I there. All my fun had finally caught up to me and I didn’t want to hook up with anyone again. We had another round and I went to the bathroom to clean up after he came on my face. I looked in the mirror and wanted to cry.

He took me home and I felt numb and too high. I got home slept and skipped a class. I knew this was stupid, I knew this was outrageous and risky. At the time though I just didn’t care. The people who should have cared for me most in my life just didn’t so why should I? I don’t know how to love or care for myself, I don’t know how to see value in my life so if it was thrown away in the moment I didn’t think it mattered.

Now I feel empty and worthless, more than before without a therapist to confide in. All my friends know I do this and are supportive because it was in good fun before but I don’t feel like I can go to them about it this time. Honestly I almost just want to go inpatient to ‘fix all my problems’ but I know that won’t do it and I’m probably not ill enough for that. I have no fucking clue.

I will see him constantly at work and hopefully I can be strong enough to handle it. I think we will mutually be neutral when we see each other but its still not something I want to do.

I just had to vent about that. Thanks for anyone who read this and I know reading this its obvious that something like this could have happened, I know I’m a stupid 19 year old but please don’t tell me that. I obviously learned my lesson.",13Nov2019,1

I have a 10 year old daughter, a 20 year old daughter, and my wife who is the best mom to both of them that there could possibly ever be.

My question is this: they are going to schedule a surgery that will likely end my hearing on that side, but remove the tumor.  The docs seem fairly certain this is most likely benign, but does a month out before surgery seem like a long time?

116,"she was my last living grandparent - my grandmother on my dad's side. she lives in another state and was getting increasingly sick for years. In all honestly, I'm glad that she can finally rest because she was at a terrible point living in a senior home, needing memory care, not really being able to understand what was going on around her, etc. I live with my dad who has had to go visit her from time to time to take care of her, but this week he left knowing that she was likely going to die. she died yesterday and he is incredibly devastated and will be staying for the funeral and all of that.

the last time I saw her was all the way back in 2009 when she was still walking and talking like normal. I loved my grandma a lot and got to see her at least once a year growing up, but after that last visit I really fell out of touch. I was around 15 years old so I really only cared about what was directly around me and I never thought to call her or keep in touch with her. then she started getting sick and I never thought to talk to her because she could hardly understand. I think I may have seen her on facetime at some point last year but other then that... I never even said anything to her besides sometimes sending my dad off with a homemade gift for her whenever he had to go take care of her. 

&amp;#x200B;

when my dad told me she died, I didn't cry and I didn't think I would since we were no longer close and out of touch. now I am crying because I've realized how guilty and horrible I feel for not even going out of my way to call or attempt to visit. not to mention, I feel terrible for my dad. so yeah, I just wanted to write this out since there's no one I know who I can really say it to.",13Nov2019,1

119,I was having a jolly good night when I noticed I had a message from a girl I used to have a small things with a few years ago. Nobody special. Just wanted to catch up. Whatever. All of a sudden. BAM. Shaking uncontrollably. I don't even know if this is a panic attack because I'm in a fine mood besides this mild annoyance of shaking and being all tense. This shit is WHACK man.,13Nov2019,1
120,"To one of my two best friends. My roommate. You've been with me through every milestone this far. My mom passing. High school grad. College grad. Every job I've had. All the ups and downs in my life. You were there. You never let me get close enough to take your picture, you were always too fast and too independent. You mean the world to me. No more pain. I love you forever. Leesa.

I know it was for the better. I woke up this morning looked at her empty bed and cried. Who ever thought. :)",13Nov2019,2
121," Proverbs 10:10 -  He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.  
 

have you ever bought and played crash bandicoot on steam? the thumbnail or w/e it's called is a picture of crash and he is winking.

so i started the game and instead of using my graphics card to run the game, it auto selected the integrating graphics card bringing the frames so low that it made the game unplayable.

this obviously will have caused much anger or sorrow in people. you can see there are many people asking about the low FPS in crash bandicoot. this is why the thumbnail to play the game has crash winking. sounds stupid right? but being stupid proves even more that im correct:

 Ecclesiastes 7:25 - an explanation for things, and **to know that wickedness is stupidity.**

whoever is acting stupid like this is proving they are wicked. this is why they decided to make this error happen automatically after you buy the game. you have to go and fix it. they did this on purpose to anger you, which is why the name of the company is steam. steam is referring to when someone is so angry ""steam"" gets shot out of their ears.

the entire company of steam is wicked. 

this is why steam has so many errors with it. why so many people have struggled with steam and why they couldnt log in, why the program has real problems to make the user experience stress.

THIS IS DONE ON PURPOSE. 

THIS IS WHY THE CEO OF STEAM IS A BILLIONAIRE. HE WORSHIPS THE DEVIL.

they do it on purpose to make you angry.

it is literal psychological warfare against certain people. they are doing their part to increase stress in this world, and they are doing it on purpose, just to add a bit more pain into your life.

Jesus said ""THE WORKING OF THE WORLD IS EVIL."" 

please wake up and realize you can not be a billionaire on this world without being fully corrupt.",13Nov2019,1
122,"Today I was watching some YouTube videos and then I had to get off a bit. I pressed the pause button, but while I wasn't home, the video continued to run for some unknown reason.

125,"One thing I learned after I fought through my depression is to never bottle up feelings. So here I am expressing it to anyone. Im not really looking for a response, just want proof that my emotions exist. In 3 years a lot has changed. Sure there have been big changes in those 3 years. My uncle got married, both my pets passed away, I tried to kill myself, and I fought my depression. But the little changes are what affect me the most. You get used to the big changes in life because you have to, but the small things stick with you for some reason. I feel really nostalgic seeing things that I saw begin now come close to an end. What triggered this really was the Konosuba movie. It really hit me during the movie that the series I started reading 3 years ago is now nearing its end and this goes for a lot of other little things in my life. I feel sad now that something that I looked forward to can not be brought into my new future, you know? I loved Konosuba during the time I had depression and it really got me into anime and manga as a medium. It saddens me that I cant bring the series into my new future, which has become a lot brighter than my past. In a way I think this post is a thank you to everything that helped me during my depression, as well as a farewell to the things that wont be able to come with me. Im really grateful for every single moment of comfort that I was given. Thank you.",13Nov2019,1
126,"It's such a strange feeling, but I'm just constantly overflowing with love. Like, I genuinely fucking love (almost) everyone I meet and I have this intense desire to show them that love. I'm recently single and I don't have a good relationship with my family, so I don't have any real outlet for this love... So it's just constantly building in my chest and it's the weirdest sensation ever. 

I like that I'm this way, but at the same time it's super hard for me. I'm really lonely because I'm fairly new to my city and I lost most of my friends to my break up. Also, I feel like my new friends are put off by how intense I am and see the way I treat them as disingenuous. I don't know how accurate that is, but I do know it's hard for me to connect with people.

Is there a reason for this? Do other people feel this way? I just want somebody to love 💖",13Nov2019,1
127,"They’ve just become too rude and toxic to me. They’ve always been rude but I let it slide more in the beginning because of their mental health issues. 


Now it’s just like one negative thing about / directed towards me after another. And don’t get me wrong I can take a joke no problem, and really like dark humor. One of my “ friends” ( quotes cause just an online friend not actually serious like this one  ) makes jokes about me all the time but I find them funny and they don’t hurt me at all or make me feel bad. His are genuinely different, individually they can be funny or not mean much, but piled together it just is way too much now. 



And even just us vibing hasn’t been the same in a while. I don’t know what it is, maybe part of it is our age gap ( I’m 18 and he’s 22 ), because that has always had moments where it was apparent, or just that our lives are taking two different directions. I think it’s a combination. 


I don’t even get the same feeling texting them, talking to them etc. sometimes I feel like the only reason I talk to them so much is because they’re my only friends, instead of me genuinely wanting to communicate with them; I want to go out, I have basically no one else to ask. 


I feel bad though. Even through the rudeness I know they care about me and will be sad of us growing distant. But I don’t like how subservient I’ve become, how I’m so cool with letting things slide, or how after he makes a rude remark I’m just like......... 
I have no idea how to respond to them 


This is sad of course because I do have a connection to them and it’s fun hanging out with them ( though they have called me boring AS we were at an event having what I thought was fun [ he was saying how he needs friends who aren’t boring like me and the other people in his life ] so I’m not sure why they do it anyways 🤷‍♂️ ). 

Oh well. Kinda unsure, stuck. :/",13Nov2019,1
128,"I started an Imgur account because I wanted to share some of my art on Habitica (an RPG game for keeping organized / staying accountable / meeting goals).

I used to be a professional artist but I stopped drawing and painting almost altogether after diving headlong into my career, and later having developed a chronic illness and subsequent depression. One of my goals has been to get back into making art every day even if it’s just something simple.

So I uploaded some of my art onto Imgur since that was the site they recommended to host images. Imgur totes itself as being a cool, fun space on the internet but so far my experiences with it is that the users are mostly jerks.

The users just leave mean comments and make fun of and downvote everything. A few people left nice comments but wow. I was really shocked. I mean my art isn’t awe-inspiring by any means but it’s not bad. Not at all what I was expecting when I uploaded my content onto that site.

If it wasn’t for the fact that I do like being able to share my art on Habitica (where it is well received) I would just take everything down...

Really a bummer.",13Nov2019,1
