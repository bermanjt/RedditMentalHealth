2,"Even worse, a coworker he I hated the most got that promotion. Now every time I see him I get angry and my whole demeanor changes. This guy in particular was always a kiss-ass and was subsequently shown favoritism the minute he began. After less than a year, he ended up getting promoted to a job that I was specifically being trained for and inquired my desire for. I was also lied to in the process by my superiors as a way of appeasement but those were just to shut me up.

It has been 9 months since his promotion and I thought I would have accepted it by now but every time I see him I'm filled with rage because he truly doesn't deserve that job and everybody else thinks so. He got it purely due to favoritism. He was bad at the job I have now but sucked up enough to pull the wool over the boss's eyes. Anyway, I don't know what to do. I feel hot when I see him in the morning and I dread going into work everyday and he' s a huge reason because of that.

I really, really needed to let this out. Sorry if I sound like I'm whining. I just can't take it anymore. I've been looking for a new job to no avail but I won't stop until I get to leave. I can't remain in an environment like this any longer.",24Sep2019,2

5,"So I posted this on another page but figured this is a better place for it.
I’m a guy going on 23 and it’s been over a year since I’ve had any form of alcoholic drink, since August 6th 2018 to be exact. I gave up drinking for spiritual reasons and became vegetarian as well. I’ve had people try to pressure me to drink lately and I always say no. I have had the want to have a beer here and there but at the same time I don’t want to break my streak. It feels like I’d be breaking my streak and my principles but a beer occasionally sounds nice. Also the fact that I’ve been so healthy just makes me think. 
Any thoughts about the situation would be nice.",24Sep2019,1
6,"I’ve been very lonely in college since I don’t have a friend group, just various individuals I’m friends with and a group where I’m not considered close enough to to be invited to anything unless I ask to be. 

It’s been lonely, I found myself trying to use relationships for validation. The past 6 months were a dark time. Slowly I’ve been getting more ok with being alone and enjoying the bursts of social interaction I have with people.

Now I have people in close with in clubs, closer than I was last year. Sometimes I’m invited to things and sometimes I invite people out. I might lose a friend which hurts. However, I’m rooming with a girl who I can become close with. And after months of working on myself and not letting myself be in a relationship, I unintentionally met someone amazing who I care about. 

I had regressive thoughts today and used my active voice to shout them down. Maybe it slowed me down, dampened my mood, but I didn’t cry or break down. Slowly I’ll get better even if I regress worse next time I’ll get back to this point and be even better.",24Sep2019,6

9,"A little context. For years, my parents abused me physically, verbally, mentally, and emotionally. They were strict Catholic parents who seriously believed their abuse was discipline (however, the law though differently). The climatic moment of all of this abuse was on June 3, 2018, when my parents concluded that I was “conspiring” against them, and so they kicked me out of the house. It was hard to fully grasp my situation after that. After all, kicking a child out of the house is something you read in books or watch in movies, not something that you would ever think would happen to you. The abuse part of my story shows just how evil my parents were. And yet, there’s a good side to this.

Being away from my abusive parents has done wonders for me. Yes, I have PTSD and depression and anxiety, but I feel safer and freer now that my parents aren’t controlling me 24/7. So, I wouldn’t say my parents themselves were a good thing to happen to me; rather, their actions, though bad, eventually led to me feeling better. 

So, “Mom” and “Dad”, thanks but no thanks.",24Sep2019,6
10,"Hey everyone, just some background before I get into the meat and potatoes of what's on my mind. I'm currently working through my masters degree in an online format while working as an intern for an engineering firm. I've been so fortunate to have a full time job lined up starting in December and a beautiful baby boy coming just before Christmas. 

While all the things I've had happen to me have been really good from the job to good grades (was never good in school until I got into the field I enjoyed) I'm constantly feeling this feeling of uncertainty about my choices in life. I wish I could put the feeling I have into words but it feels just so complicated. It honestly feels like I'm standing at a crossroads with 10 different streets converging to the intersection and I just don't know which path to choose. I know I have a family to think about now and that heavily impacts all the decisions I make but the question still exists of whether I am making the right choice and that makes me hesitant sometimes. 

The uncertainty I have inside is a whole different level than outside decisions. I'm really struggling with my identity in life and who I am not only to the world but most importantly to myself. I know what I want to do and where I want to be somewhat but outside things just don't satisfy me and there is a deep conflict within me I just don't know how to address. I'm usually a pretty goofy (very much a Tigger) person in nature and I'm very outgoing but a lot of the times the world seems very gray (especially at work) and that makes me feel isolated and makes me question who I am. 

I could probably write a novel of the issues of uncertainty I have...There's just so much I want to understand that I don't about myself and the world. I've tried talking to a therapist and a counselor and that just never worked for me. My mind always races with these questions of self and I just don't know how to find the answers.",24Sep2019,3
11,"Throughout my years of high school and an early party to college, I used to pride myself in being a ""lone wolf."" Not that I was anti-social, but in that I never had a friend who I could (or would have) formed a close bond with. Mostly people that I hang around with were ""acquaintances"" who just so happened to need someone to talk to until the lunch bell ring so we can go back inside the classroom. 

Fast forward a few years, I am attending a university in a fairly rural area. At present I lead a student club with a healthy attendance along with regular participation in two other clubs. I guess it's fair to say that some people on campus would recognize my face and say ""hi"" here and there. But I have noticed that people rarely conversate with me beyond our small talk ""how are you doing,"" ""what's your major,"" ""are you a senior?"" 

But small talks is not my problem, at least I do not think so. My problem generally arises when I have been forced into too many social occasions. I start to have social withdrawal (in the sense that I feel like I don't fit in or belong with the group). So far, throughout my years in uni, I have done a good job of hiding that feeling, but now it is taking it's toll. I used to always enjoy doing things alone, but lately I have gotten a weird yearn to want to share my experience of living with someone. 

But at the same time, I don't want to bring anyone in my life right now because it would be a distraction to my studies. I also do not want them to have to go through navigating my fluctuating mood swings, social withdrawals, and my overall feeling of social disconnect with my peers. Fuck, my writing here must be so incoherent as I am very tired as I write this. Hopefully reading this tomorrow when I wake up with a sound mind would give me some sense of control over my spiraling emotions.

12,"Man I just feel like I don't know who I am. I know who I *want* to be, but that's just not going to work out. I hate my personality, I find it annoying and asshole-like. Maybe it's just because I seem to have opened up a lot recently and I'm not used to it, but I just don't like it. People at school are being friendlier and more open to me, but why? I'm not that different. pity? hell if I know. I don't really like it. There was a nice aspect to being left alone and having my own little group. I dunno. I've always been this weird mix of socially awkward and shy, but yet also not. I've always been somewhat of a dick, but also nice. I just can't seem to work out who I am. I can't hold up a conversation. I can't start a conversation. I can't even maintain eye contact because of how awkward I was in elementary. I'll maintain a conversation for long enough to get the person an answer. But then I always feel like I've somehow left them unhappy or thinking I'm weird. You know, I always was the kind of person who was shy. Actually shy. not just saying it, but just being that way. Now I feel I'm the person who *says* they are shy. Like a remnant from the past in which I subconsciously still live. I never have anything interesting to talk about either. I don't usually think about it much since I'm almost always busy. But right now, I just don't feel like doing anything. Back to the main point though. I dunno, I just can't shake this feeling, that I'm not who I really am. I am usually decent with my friends, but I feel so one dimensional. ""Oh who's that guy,"" ""Oh, you know, the one who makes a decent joke once in a while and has a monotone voice."" My friends like me, so I guess that's something. But how can I appreciate it when I don't like my own personality. My IRL friends and I share so little in common we hardly talk about anything. I just kinda show a meme, we laugh, and move on. One of them, my friend since elementary, talks with me a bit, but really only directly after school.  


I try to improve myself, but every time, I just feel even less like myself. How could I dig myself out of a hole, when the shovel is left at the top? I just want to fill my personality out, but when my personality seems to have more tension than the ethnic tension of yugoslavia, how could I possibly do that. If I don't know who I am, and can only know when I get further away then how could I fill out myself to feel less one dimensional. Maybe I'm just stuck in the past. My body is trying to modernize, but my mind isn't willing to accept it. Maybe my awkwardness over the years is just piling on into this mess of spaghetti. I don't know. Maybe one day I'll figure it out. Maybe when my hormones calm down. But who am I kidding, It's completely possible that I just never figure it out, It's not like hitting 18-25 just magically fixes my problems. Until then, I'll just leave this rant here. I'm not even going to edit it. Maybe one day, in 5-10 years I can just look back to this post and think to myself ""wow, I really was an attention whore"" or ""wow I'm glad I'm not having to deal with that anymore."" But I suppose time will tell.  


If you actually read that, thanks. I know it was poorly formatted and a huge long senseless ramble. I just kinda wanted somewhere to document this/ get it off my chest.",24Sep2019,1
13,"Just took a sip of wine and felt something in my mouth. Thought it was a pantry moth, which have occasionally found their way into my drinks, but I pulled it out and it was a maggot. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Checked the glass, no maggots. Checked the wine bottle, no maggots. 

I can still feel the phantom of the damn thing and am so grossed out. I get really bad health anxiety and feel like I swallowed a bunch before realizing, which naturally will become flies and burst from my stomach.

But anyways I’m a high schooler who has gone to a small private school for my entire high school/middle school career and as this has helped me, it has, in quite a few situations left me with quite large amount of social anxiety (with girls and people at my work etc...).

20,"I want to share my feelings about BPD with you because I want you to understand my struggle. I know that understanding BPD is difficult; there are times when it seems even I don’t understand. This struggle has provoked intense and unfamiliar feelings in me, and I fear that my reactions to these feelings might be misunderstood. I hope my ability to cope and your ability to understand will improve as I share my feelings with you. I want you to understand.

You may describe me this way: impulsive, manipulative, fake, attention-seeking, toxic, reckless, a whiner, lazy, a drama queen, needy, intense, and irresponsible. Those aren’t very admirable traits; and sometimes I struggle to keep from identifying with them. But I prefer to describe myself this way: afraid, isolated, confused, guilty and ashamed, angry, sad, and vulnerable.

My BPD makes me feel afraid. Not just small apprehension; the sweaty-palm, tight stomach, narrow vision kind of afraid. I am afraid of losing this fight and dying by suicide. I am afraid of going back to cutting. I am afraid of hurting others so much that I am afraid to love too deeply. I am afraid of being alone because of my BPD. I am afraid of what creative ways my too-damn-clever brain will come up with for me to destroy myself when I am caught in a shame spiral. I am afraid of going through decades of MRIs and lumbar punctures because of neurological episodes that could just be conversion disorder because I’m too crazy for my brain to handle, even though I know that there are freckles on my brain that concern my neurologists enough to want to get new MRIs each year. I am afraid of getting enough control of my BPD to go back to working full-time only to have another episode with new areas of demyelination that just make my BPD worse again and undo my hard work. I’m afraid of breaking someone else’s heart. I’m afraid of having to see the sadness and fear in the eyes of people I love when I am in crisis. I’m afraid that I’ll never actually get well enough to work full-time again and being a burden for the rest of my life or winding up in a mental health group home once my parents are gone.

My BPD makes me feel isolated. Even in a crowded room or surrounded by people whom I know care about me, I feel like I am the only one having to check with her brain and say, “Shut up, you overactive amygdala, let my PFC do its job.""

My BPD makes me feel confused. I didn’t have an abusive or traumatic childhood. My parents encouraged me and supported me, and they still do. Why me? Why did my brain have to develop with defects when my parents and aunties and uncles kept me safe, loved, and supported? What’s wrong with me? Why am I broken?

My BPD makes me feel guilty and ashamed. I know that I’ve hurt others. I have said, written, and done things that made me the villain in my own story. I am working on the shame, but I still feel guilty because what I did was so very wrong. And grief…I grieve the friendships and relationships that my neurodivergent brain destroyed in its moments of unregulated terror.

My BPD makes me feel angry. I’m a good person!! I don’t like hurting people. I really don’t. I can’t leave this world better than I found it by hurting others, but my fucking brain goes into overdrive and fear mode and I feel like I’m The Narrator watching Tyler Durden harm everything I love.

Which goes back to being afraid to love too deeply…

My BPD makes me sad. I wanted to be a teacher so much that I gave my toys spelling tests; I blew through 100 CUs to get my BA in 5 terms because I wanted it so badly… But I can’t. My brain can’t cope with being a full-time teacher, and I don’t know if it ever will be able to. I was supposed to be done with my Master’s and working on my PhD in Special Education and JD so I could be Rev. Dr. baohst, PhD, Esq. I was supposed to be part of an “us”, but I feel like I will always be a “them”. An undeserving “them” in the eyes of society because I’m just another BPD crazy.

And my BPD makes me feel vulnerable. I know that in vulnerability there is strength, so I take some comfort in that. I feel like the raw, naked, overactive emotions I have also allow me to connect with others quickly and easily. But I can’t turn off that vulnerability, so I wind up curled up on the floor of my mind and weeping with the intensity of what I feel, while trying to keep the tears from running down my face and scaring others away.

I am learning how to cope with my BPD and manage it. I’m learning to work with my mind and pay attention to physical responses to emotion so that I can manage my crises better.

You can help me. I know you care about me, and I know my BPD affects our relationship. My sadness causes you sadness; what hurts me hurts you too. I believe we can help each other through this sadness. Individually, we both seem quite powerless, but together, we can be stronger. Maybe some of these hints will help us to better understand my BPD.

I need you to be nonjudgmental. I don’t need to hear “that was stupid” or “that was selfish” if I am in crisis or I tell you about something I did when I was in crisis. If I am in crisis, that will only push me further down my spiral; if I am on the other side of crisis, then there is no judgment that you can pass that my mind hasn’t already said a thousand ways meaner. Rubbing my nose in shame will not help anyone.

I need you to be supportive. Encourage me in my growth. Respect my decisions, even if you don’t agree with them. If you notice something positive that I’ve done or that I’ve overcome a crisis, tell me you’re proud of me.

I need you to be present. Physical touch helps me. A lot. So if you can spare a hug, or put an arm around my shoulder or a hand on my back, or give an encouraging squeeze of the hand, or even a high five, you can help. If you aren’t comfortable with physical touch, that’s ok, too. We don’t have to touch, but when I am feeling empty and alone, having someone choosing to sit with me can mean the world. I may not always be able to speak, but if I can…

I need you to be a listener. Please don’t rush to give me the quickest platitude; please don’t tell me how much worse others have it. Speaking my pain isn’t easy. If you can’t listen, I won’t bother you because I’m a grown woman who doesn’t need babysitting or I just need to get over it or I’m just being dramatic and it’s not really that big of a deal… Things that I know are bullshit, but my mind will start saying over and over until it gets so loud that I can’t speak over it.

I need you to be comfortable with me, and then I will feel more comfortable with myself. Talking about BPD is hard. If you are worried about saying the wrong thing, then share that with me. Don’t wallow in uncertainty. If I sense that you are afraid of me, I will withdraw to save you from the pain that I bring. And uncertainty can feel like fear.

I need you to be sensitive with me. Don’t trivialize my struggle by saying that I wasn’t serious in my previous suicide attempts because I didn’t succeed. Don’t tease me by calling me a drama queen or an attention seeker. I may use dark humor to cope, but it’s easy to cross into dismissal and invalidation.

I need you to be honest with me. I just got this diagnosis April 2018. I’m still working on this. If you need time to adjust, tell me; I’ve needed it, too. If you don’t understand something, please let me know so I can try to explain.

I need you to be informed. Be informed so that you can challenge others who try to perpetuate stereotypes, stigma, and myths. Don’t tell me that I’m overmedicated. Don’t ask me to “snap out of it” if I’m in crisis because I physically can’t; my ability to self-soothe and regulate my own emotions is handicapped. Not sure what to do? Walk me through deep breathing. Point out things to ground me in reality. If you’re comfortable, put a hand on my back so that I can have a tether to reality while I come back down, or give me a long, tight hug and help get some oxytocin pumping.

I need you to be patient. Working on my BPD is a process; even if I manage to get my symptoms under enough control to no longer meet diagnostic criteria, my battle with my mind will always be my hardest fight.

I need you to be strengthening by providing me encouragement when I lose faith in myself. Remind me of the good, the joy, the life, the light, the passion, and the accomplishments that you’ve seen with me. Encourage me to continue to grow, to laugh, to sing. Celebrate with me my successes, even ones as small as when I can overcome my executive dysfunction and clean up after myself or my animals. I don’t need you to be a rock; you can loan me your strength with a meme or encouraging text. Remind me that I’m more than my BPD.

I can’t predict the future, but I can say this much: I am working each day on making it to the next. My struggle with learning to manage my BPD has taught me a greater capacity for forgiveness, compassion, understanding, and most of all gratitude. Thank you for taking the time to sit through this.",24Sep2019,1

23,"I was a super innocent kid, and I loved absolutely everything about myself and my life. I wasn’t sheltered, but I don’t think I ever let the emotion or realization set in of how awful people really could be. I looked up the holocaust, slaughter houses, homelessness, murder – it was the first time I wasn’t worried about my internet history. And the shock of everything really, really changed me. 

My image of humanity was shattered, I used to believe everyone had good in them, like nothing bad would ever happen. 

I was realizing that I was growing up.

I guess I’ve always been a sentimental kid, but this felt different, almost like betrayal.

I sunk low, really low. My parents didn’t notice for almost a year, and it was ups and far downs for a few more years after. Since then, 8 years ago, I’m doing much better, but I still kind of feel it under my skin, like a looming shadow that you just kind of get used to.

I like fashion and if I dressed the way I wanted all the time I'd feel too self conscious of people thinking I wasn't  manly enough. 


I prefer to shave a lot more than I do. It's way more comfortable and practical to me to shave under my arms and my chest but I don't because of the same reason. I think I'd even shave my legs if I felt like I could.



And most of all I'll absolutely NEVER let people see me cry or really express my emotions at all. Even when I was at a place like the 9/11 memorial and was moved to tears I went into a bathroom stall to cry so people didn't see me. I was at a play recently and the same thing, I was fighting with everything to not show I was tearing up to the point that I was distracted from the show.


I went to Chicago last week for a concert and it was nice. I went by myself and being around millions of people I didn't know I felt a little better about it. The concert was for a female singer songwriter I love and the concert was almost entirely girls which I knew it would be and I was self conscious about being there at first. A group kinda took me in though and even though he was just there for his girlfriend there was one other guy in our group so I felt better.


As it went on I felt really comfortable with them. One of the girls in our group had face glitter and I said YES that's fun I'll take some. And in the concert I DID cry and just let it happen.


It was nice but any time I'm back home or anywhere besides a huge city or something I'm constantly self conscious again",24Sep2019,24

Why is my mind wired up like that. Overthinking can help us in so many ways but it can also be the worst thing we do. Overthinking with a little bit of curiosity and  determination can get us to think of new things like building a house, a app, the next best selling phone or computer, a medicine to fight off viruses or something big, machines that can save lives. You get the point right? But then it can also destroy us. Make us think we are a failure, we said something wrong, we did something wrong, did I lock the front door?

43,"Irish - Different system, college is not as expensive, less choice in what you study (prescribed courses) and less flipping and choosing.

&amp;#x200B;

I've previously studied 2 years worth of a business degree before dropping out, I tried a couple of other things and I tried to go back and repeat some exams in the original degree.  
During this time I came down with mono and I failed my exams, again.  


I took a year out and tried my hand at an electrician apprenticeship - really hated that and knew it wasn't for me.

  
So I looked at going back to college.. that's why I am now in a different college studying business with nicer subjects (less maths, stats, accounting, econ) and I'm still not happy.  
The course is 'fine' but it's boring to all hell.

&amp;#x200B;

This college offers a 2 year diploma in music.. which is actually in a number of different areas from production to sound equipment to instrument repair/building.

  
I'm really considering changing to the 2 year course.

I could learn to fix and build instruments - something I love and I could learn about sound engineering and sound systems, I would love to start my own business in the future and something in the vein of sound engineer/studio/sound equipment rental could work.

Since then I have recovered my inner child, grown closer to my family, healed all my repressed trauma, let go of my internal drama. I enjoy my daily routine of waking up at 5am to start my day and living a simple, minimalist life striving to be service to others with my skills and knowledge. 

I've scaled a creative agency while working at a tech company from an idea to a way to travel while working remotely. I've explored most of the lower 48 and went to Colombia during this time. In the next year, I will go to Mexico, Central America, Europe, Egypt, and Asia. 

I've met a few cool mentors who have taught me a lot about life and work. I've dated a few interesting women who helped me realize what I wanted and didn't want. I am happily single right now and growing into the kind of man that could take care of a family if I ever wanted to do that. 

I am working on some humanitarian and climate projects in my free time that I hope will make a world of difference for all of us. I turn 30 in January. I feel like a kid at heart but am an old soul through and through.

45,"For a long while I’ve always been known as the “pillar” in people’s life’s, Someone that everyone can go to to keep them holding hope, Someone that they feel like can take in their problems and know how to fix everything, someone that regardless of the problem will know exactly what to say to help. But here’s the thing... I’m just winging it. There a people in life right now that are all experiencing their own form of depression and not knowing where they are in life. There’s so many people that are being opened up about their issues and being constantly asked how they are doing and if all is fine, WHICH is great, They need that.

But a lot of people always assume that because I’m always “Strong” on the outside and don’t express what it is I’m feeling, that I have everything figured out and that I don’t have issues, that whatever I feel, they think I’ll get through it on my own. 
And too be honest... I Fucking hate it. I hate being so consumed with everyone’s else issues that I don’t even find the time to deal with mine, that whatever I’m going through is nothing till Someone is feeling better about themselves. I hate being selfless, But I hate being selfish even more and slowly, day by day, issues after issue, I’m beginning to hate myself.

46,"Apologize for the wall but my adrenalines pumping and I can’t sleep unless I get this out haha hope someone enjoys maybe 

Started a new cooking job at an upscale brewpub a couple months back and was working at the sister restaurant tonight out in the boonies.  I figured picking up a day here or there would help me get a bit of OT.  It’s a Monday in the boonies, basically my slow day right?

Third day at the restaurant I show up and the one other cook is ready to go.  To be fair it’s Monday, zero people inside, and I’m fairly confident in my cooking abilities as I’m a fairly skilled cook.  

Or so I thought.  

He takes off and I start studying the menu a bit more.  It’s only my third day at this place and I haven’t made all of the plates. I’m very confident on the menu at my main restaurant, but this one is like 30% different.  Many of the dishes I’m comfortable with have slight variations; cucumber instead of tomato on a salad, white wine instead of red on one dish only etc.  

All of a sudden I look up and there are like 4 tables sat in the restaurant.  No problem.  I double check my line and make sure I’m ready.  

First ticket in, two cheesesteaks with soup.  Easy.

I get about halfway through and hear the next orders coming in.  Two tickets this time, to be expected.  

A burger, marsala, and a kids alfredo.  No problem.  

I start kicking into gear.  Cheesesteaks are halfway done, ready to melt cheese.  Chicken and burger down.  Sautéing for Marsala. Cut buns to toast. Start Alfredo. 

My hearts already pounding.  I can’t deny I love the thrill, and I’m crushing it.  I take the bread down and set plates for my first ticket, ready to sell with no problem.

What. The. Fuck.

The restaurant is filled, and for being a small hole in the wall in the boonies we probably have 15 tables sat inside, with more out on the patio.

I know I’m fucked.  I’ve cooked in a 5 man team doing Mother’s Day brunch doing 4K in sales per hour but I was a part of a TEAM.  I realize that despite all of the experience I think I have I’ve never done a full line myself which includes the time it takes to make a plate look pretty...probably the most time consuming and delicate action.

Fast forward 20 minutes and I have at least ten tables, all with 2-4 entree items.  Our menu is from scratch and even our burgers require sautéing vegetables and I’m just getting destroyed.  From there it was a blur, literally.  Constantly having to look at the menu to make sure it’s being made correctly and tasting sauces to make sure they are perfect, all while panicking the rest of my food is about to burn

Even now I can’t believe that no food was sent back.  I had an incredible team in the rest of the building...could not have done it without them.  

Was incredibly humbling and it’s been a long time since I’ve been shaking with excitement like this after a shift.

I thought its be fine, dissertation sure whatever. But my other modules seemed decent. For one module The first lecture was good, its 80% final exam, so as long as I study full be good. But the other module. Oh god.

I slept terribly last night and missed my 9am lecture for it. So, I was catching up in the lecture slides and recordings. And I have no idea what this module is about. It's a computer science module so I thought it would be just some coding. Nope, its proper hardware development stuff. Coding in c++ which I've never even used before. I'm barely okay coding with java. Its 100% coursework, so no exams, but I dont understand what the assignments are asking for.

I didn't think much of it, and resubmitted it to r/watchandlearn, the post got 10pts in 1 hour until it was removed.

I submitted a different videos to r/videos just to test the theory, and it wasn't removed. Then I resubmitted my video and it was also removed after 10 minutes.

57,"what made me write this post was the amount of women posting their stories on facebook and telling people to be careful. 
so this happened about 5 years ago. i was 17 years old and a senior in high school.  since i had enough credits in school, i would leave school at 12:30. this particular day, i had to meet my mom at her job in the city because i had an eye appointment. knowing that the city is very huge, i always get lost trying to get to my mom’s job even though i’ve been there numerous times in my life. i was going back and forth trying to find my way to her job. so i pulled up google maps to make sure i was going the right way.  
once i was on the right way, a young guy (maybe mid to late 20s) in a business suit approached me and said “excuse me miss” i stopped for some reason and said “yes?” he was asking where i was going and i lied saying that i was going to work. all i can remember was that he was trying to offer me a “better job” and all i kept saying to him was that i’m running late. what made me more nervous was that he was walking with me and VERY set on offering me this “job”. I kept saying “no” or  “sorry but i’m really late for work.” he finally left me alone and i speed walked my way to my moms office building. i didn’t tell her what happened. 
about a month or so later, i’m sitting in my living room doing homework and a news story on tv caught my attention. 3 men and 1 woman were arrested on human sex trafficking charges and i recognized one of the men. he was the same person offering me this “job” that was probably the biggest bullet i ever dodged in my life.",24Sep2019,0

This creates excessive anxiety, and it feels like *brain.exe* just refuses to work. In social situations, I get self-conscious to the point where I can't speak at all. I get too scared of making any mistakes. And that was probably the reason why some of my friends turned away from me.

And, the thing is, I haven't always been like that. Two years ago, when I entered the university, I was incredibly social and super in-the-moment. At that point in my life, I experienced an unbelievably freeing feeling I'd never felt before. I felt alive. I was actually enthusiastic about meeting people and doing things. I used to wake up feeling energetic and looking forward to face challenges. But I've lost all that somewhere along the way.

I can't welcome a criminal burglar heroin addict to be around wife and kids, no matter who they are.

He wanted to be a dentist.  From one guy to another, it breaks my heart.  He never had a chance.  Parents divorced, verbally abusive alcoholics.

He moved back home in the states after a few years and went 10 feet deeper into delinquency. Now he has a criminal record in multiple counties.

I spent over six years just being single as a boyfriend was not part of my to do list while I was finishing school. In that time guys flirting with me was a normal occurrence so I always assumed when I wanted to settle down it would be easy to find someone, oh how wrong I was. 

So when I started looking for for last year around mid March, I  started in the obvious and common places like my church and places where I do leisure activities at. From the get go there a few guys that were interested in me but did not meet my expectations. Okay whatever I was going to see it through, I was gonna get a boyfriend. There was this really good looking guy who was really into me and cue in the months trying to get to know this guy only to be rejected by him when I finally get the nerve to ask him out. Being rejected by him was a huge punch in the gut because he never gave me his reasons why.

A little hurt and broken from the experience as I invested months into this guy, I went on a several of dates with two separate guys who flirted with me at the gym (not at the same time obviously), being asked out by these guys was a huge confidence booster because they were completely gorgeous and out of my league. Things didn't work out with both because they were both very untrustworthy, the first one hooking up with other girls behind my back and the second one lied about his job.

After failing miserably at finding a partner in real life I tried online dating and was ghosted by several guys in that time, one even stood me up when we had planned a date. 

At this point I was considering taking up drinking instead of looking for a boyfriend, and I did spend sometime one my lonesome realizing that I liked being single. Dating was not for me but I had sexual needs and in this world we live in seeing someone for that reason is okay, so I met up with someone who was interested in the same thing. We were in a strict business only relationship making both our expectations of the relationship clear, we lasted a few months before he unexpectedly dumped me because he preferred masburating to porn than actual sex with a living person. WTF?? And I have nothing to show for that relationship because I am still a virgin:/

That was two weeks ago and I am just completely over it, I have had a good cry about this past year and a half because I feel utterly hopeless. I know I have burnt a lot of bridges with a lot of people in my endeavour for love, I have tried being the Madonna no one would have me then I tried being the Slut and I was rejected because of it.

I’m going to be honest he wasn’t my type at first. He was not attractive and he was way to old for me ( 6 years older) even tho I was always attracted to older guys. I was young, vulnerable and convinced that no one will ever find me attractive even tho that was objectively very untrue but you know teenagers. He gave me something no man has ever given me. He listened to me, talked to me and was interested in me. He flirted with me and made me feel special. I feel in love with him quite quick and very strongly. But he is not really a great partner and i’m being kind when i say that. He was emotionally abusive, controlling and down right mean. After 8 months he left me for another woman.

She said she wants me to be more creative within the limits our company has and that she wants to do whatever she can to keep me happy. I’ve never had a boss appreciate me this much. A lot of my struggles with the company don’t have to do with her either. It felt so fucking good to feel noticed and appreciated. The money is a huge plus too.

78,"I want to kill myself. I feel pathetic for even saying it, but that's just it. I'm tired of being this pathetic piece of shit. And i'll admit, from the outside, things looks kind of okay. I look okay, have great friends, great family, and a good job for someone in my field. But honnestly, i just can't take it. I'm fucking 35 years old and i haven't maintained an adult relationship for more than 5 months in my entire life. Because i'm just so fucking insecure, they all just run away. I finished my PhD and got this job, that i though i would love, that i worked for all my life, and i just fucking hate it. I can barely take care of myself, i have no more fucks to give. I've recently started taking benzos on a daily basis just to function. I go to work and cry in my office. I feel like a lazy piece of shit. I've always wanted kids, but can't keep a relationship. I recently fucked it up monumentally, within 2 months, with a guy who had been in love with me for 9 years, who though i was the hottest and smartest and coolest person in the world. Left his GF to finally be with me. And i fucked it up, in a heart beat. Because i'm just so fucking sad and needy and pathetic.

I’m involved in almost every big project we have going on right now and it almost feels as if they think I’m a robot. Its a creative job and lately I feel like I cant put as much effort as I wish I could. Multiple things went bad yesterday and it was just too much. Apart from that I’ve been doing freelance for a Spanish band on the side. This takes a big chunk of my free time but it’s fulfilling because I get to work with my best-friend and I get to travel with them. I was also really upset because an old friend of mine recently passed away. I was in such a bad place. I told my girlfriend I was thinking about quitting my job. I thought to myself maybe I can just travel for a bit and then go back into work. She told me she backed me up and to do what I want as long as I’m in a good head space.

Then today, I was working from home and really early on my boss messaged me (around 6am) to tell me she needed to talk to me. Once I did she went through one of our projects and gave me some edits. She then told me that she will need me involved in some of our projects  until October 30th. She told me they really like working with me and they have noticed that I’ve been stressed (even though I never brought it up to her) and that she was going to give me a pay increase and give me two snow days.

Even if it's a small issue that we're fighting about or having a disagreement about, I often wonder if I'm making a mistake with the relationship. I've recently realized how toxic a mindset this is, but I'm not really sure where to go from here with improvement.

90,"In 2 months, I have an entrance exam which I decided to give my all in. The exam is for 3 hours with no breaks in between. It consists of 100 questions. Basically, there's no time to breathe. My case here is, I am able to do well for the first hour of the exam before my stamina and focus start to fade away and I can see that in the results. The exam is broken up into 3 sections. I get 99 percentile in the first section and then start decreasing to 90 and 80 in the later sections. It's not that I can't answer the questions. When I analyze the test I've written, there were questions I was able to answer that I left, or I made a silly mistake in the ones that I answered. I've been through a multiple of these tests now, and this has always been the case. Through constant feedback, I think I now know what's the real problem here. It's not the skill but the focus to persist. 

Also, 2 more things to add: 

1. During the exams, through section 1-3, I know my focus is not 100%. I've been thinking about other things that randomly pop up in my mind which I think I'm unable to control. My ex cheating on me a year ago still haunts to this date, adding to the mental strain and distraction. 

2. I know there are apps for meditation that can be helpful, I've tried. It works for a day or two, and then I forget about it and I get back to the same old self. 

I need a 99.xx percentile overall to clear the exam. With 2 months left, a bit of advice on helping me focus would be of real help and it's much appreciated.",24Sep2019,1

The One that got away


I remember being your best friend in school
I remember being one of the only people there for you
I remember all the hard times you went through
I remember seeing that notification from you after not talking for a few years, made me smile, made me happy.
I remember our first kiss, it was on the first date.
I remember our first date, I was awkward as hell mainly because your eyes just made my breath go away and I didn’t know what to say.

I will never stop loving you regardless of how much you screwed me over.
I will always be there for you regardless of the past, we are both young.
I understand why you did what you did to me, with that being said.

I’m sorry for not being there for you emotionally, I always felt like I was walking on eggshells, like you would break up with me any minute.
I’m sorry for crossing your boundaries, there was no excuse for that and there never will.
Sorry is just an understatement, but I think the way i feel is indescribable.

This was not all my fault, you were in the wrong as well.
You should of been honest about everything.
You should of fought for us.
You dipped when times were rough.
You didn’t and still won’t give me the closure I need.

I don’t know why i’m writing this.
But I wish you happiness and peace.
I will always love you and you will always have a place in my heart.
I will always be here.
Maybe one day we can reconcile.

Oh and by the way.
Your new guy, heard a lot of bad stuff about him.
Everyday we are class, it hurts my heart to knowing how bad he treats you. 

You are my first love and nothing will change that.",24Sep2019,1
93,"Okay so this might sound silly but I just started university and I'm already sick of it.  
I'm doing a major in psychology and a minor in sport and social science. Psychology is pretty interesting but my sport stuff involves shit like physiology, learning about Swiss (I live in Switzerland) sport institutions and other boring shit like the history of sport. Not only are half my subjects boring but half my teachers speak so f-ing fast that going to lectures is pretty much pointless because I have to spend the whole evening at home summarizing or figuring out wtf they were talking about from the few keywords I managed to write down. I spent the whole weekend in the library trying to summarize the 40 something slides of anatomy and physiology that they explained so poorly to us and now I've caught a cold because I slept like 5 hours and it's cold as hell outside. I still have to summarize all the stupid lessons I didn't understand today but because I'm sick I'm writing this reddit post instead.

I've never really known what I wanted to do with my life. I heard that a good way to figure out what I like is to think about what I will want to be doing 10 years from now. But how am I supposed to know that when I've been spending most of my time studying for futile exams in high school?  


I chose psychology because nothing else interested me in uni and I like analysing people and situations etc. whatever, the cliché thing. I have no career ideas in mind and spending a total of 5 years to become a psychologist or even longer in post grad to end up working in a hospital sounds like 5 more insufferable years just like high school was. I was so glad to have finished high school, why the hell am I back in a classroom with useless teachers and late night revisions again? I don't want to be here. Fyi, I chose sport as a minor because I like going to the gym LOL.  


I'm mainly doing university to make my parents happy. I've been so lucky to have such supportive parents who would do anything to help me succeed, but it's more than that. They're getting older, my dad is 70, my mum is 62, they want me to at least have a degree so that I'm hirable, but what the hell can I do with a Bachelor in Psychology? Not a lot. I don't know, maybe I should just continue and figure it out as I go along... But I still feel anxious, and lonely too, I have no friends, I'm not a loser, I'm a charming guy and had friends in high school, but it's hard to make friends in a lecture hall of like 500 people.   


One more thing, apart from going to the gym to de-stress, my only real passion is making Youtube videos. Really, being able to be creative as a way to make people laugh is what makes me truly happy. I absolutely love it. I dreamed of becoming a Youtuber for ages and ages, but in recent years I've just had a complete creative drought and it's made me very depressed. During school it was because I was busy with exams, during summer it was because there was nothing to stimulate me. It's so discouraging not to be able to do what I love, especially because at this stage there's definitely no money guaranteed from it (8k subs lol) and I hate not having any direction.   


I thought of putting up with uni for 3 years so that my parents will be happy then finding a random job to support myself and to pursue my dream... but I thought the same thing back in high school, and here I am now, just passing through life.

94,"I found that I really love quinoa when I tried it at a local cafe, I didn’t have any issues eating it from there and it tasted really good so I decided to try making some at home.

To be on the safe side (taste wise) I decided to stick with a personal recipe I came up with for spaghetti (which is made up of lots of vegetables, olive oil, and lots of seasonings). It was organic but I couldn’t find anywhere that it was prewashed so I assumed it simply wasn’t. I made sure to wash it, I washed it twice in fact since I knew quinoa can have a bitter taste if it’s not washed. So after that I cooked it, came out good and tasted amazing. I didn’t taste any bitterness or anything.

I almost immediately started getting a splitting headache. I thought it was odd and stopped eating. Eventually it turned into an extreme headache, I was visibly shaking and my stomach hurt horribly. I stopped eating it, put it away, and like most people immediately went online to see what could have happened.

I saw a lot of things saying allergic reactions happen quite often with quinoa, I have a severe allergy to shrimp but my reaction isn’t anything like that and how come I could eat it just fine before? I know since I have allergies that sometimes allergic reactions get worse and worse the more they happen, so maybe I was having a reaction but couldn’t tell? Idk.

I did more digging and it seems I was supposed to soak it for 24 hours. Is this true? What else could I have done wrong? Or could this simply be an allergic reaction? I’m thinking about bringing it up with a doctor next time I go because after 4 days I am still getting the headaches. The severe pain lasted 2 days. I just have 0 clue how it could cause something so severe. Even my severe allergic reactions went away within one day (I didn’t know I was allergic at the time when this occurred) but I suppose other reactions are different, even though my grass allergy is relatively the same :,) I didn’t experience swelling anywhere while eating it, but I did feel bloated.

I’m now hesitant to eat quinoa and quite disappointed since I love it so much :/ I am wondering is there is something I should change and try to make it again.",24Sep2019,1

103,"So... this has been a sticky situation that I've been posting about recently because idk where else to go than anonymously online.

I'll condense the story, but basically I made some missteps with one of my close female friends, she dealt with it by ghosting me with absolutely no warning over a week after it happened. I tried my hardest to fix things, but to no avail, as she won't even talk to me, and this point I kind of want nothing to do with her so I can just get on with my life and put this behind me.

Problem is, I can't. She was one of my best friends. Me, her, and my other best friend/roommate (who is related to her) would hang out almost every week. They still do that, but instead I'm stuck at home knowing that they're having fun without me. Plus I still hear about her through offhand comments, and every time it just reopens the wound.

105,"My mom was never the crunchy granola type of parent but she had a subscription to Mother Earth News in the 80’s and growing up, our household was all about recycling. She looked down on heavily packaged foods, heavily processed foods, and so on. She wanted to do her part to make the earth a better place, and used all her might to instill it into me and my siblings. 


Can’t speak much for my dad, he’s always been a miserable, selfish person stuck in his own bubble. I’m not even sure if he’s aware he’s living on a dying planet, or maybe he just doesn’t give a shit since he knows he isn’t going to live with the consequences of his generation. 


With all the stuff in the news lately of the planet in crisis, and Greta Thunberg making headlines, and student protests, I suppose it finally got to him. I was having dinner with my parents the other night, and when I was in the kitchen putting away dishes, I hear them murmuring to each other about the current events. My dad was mocking the kids who are protesting the lack of concern for climate change. He wondered “what are they gonna do once we can’t drive cars anymore?? I bet they didn’t think of that! How are they gonna get to school? Maybe they should think about things before causing a ruckus” and mom just nodded her head in agreement (???).


DO ALL YOU OLD FUCKS HAVE DEMENTIA??? 



Are the adults not responsible for the children??? Did your generation not create the crisis we are in now????? Why the FUCK do you think today’s kids are so mad? They will have to deal with your mess, and you’re mocking them for having an opinion on it???

She had organized one while we were together and I remember how happy being able to get participation and donations made her. I had to leave it early because my brother got a DUI that morning (yes before noon) which she understood, but was still upset about. I broke up with her shortly after, and hurt her a lot and was overall not good to her in the final stretch. Something I regret a lot to this day and was the catalyst for getting myself into therapy and a lot of positive growth down the stretch for me. I've always regretted bettering myself at her expense and still care for her a bunch. 

Anyway I noticed no one had signed up or donated yet so I went ahead and submitted an anonymous donation and honestly it's made my entire day so much better. It's for a great cause to and it just reminded me how much giving brings me joy. I love this feeling and I hope it made her happy as it did last time.

I don't know how I got this way but my mind is always trying to overthink things to make me not to do it. Every since I was a kid I felt like a failure and I hated living.
