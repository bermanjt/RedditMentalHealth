0,"When my child was born, the doctor took a sample from the umbilical cord. At the time I knew nothing about donating and we did not pay for it to be done. When I asked the doctor if that was where they take stem cell samples, he responded with, ""Did you pay for it?"". When I replied no, he ignored me, finished what he had left to do and quickly left the room.

Any ideas what is going on?",28Sep2019,4

14,"I’m 23 years old. I’m permanently depressed and have extremely rough anxiety, and I’m unmedicated for both of those issues due to lack of health insurance. I live with my alcoholic grandfather, helping as much as I can with the care of my grandmother, who has been suffering from Alzheimer’s for at least the past decade. Last year right before the holiday season, my four year girlfriend that I had spend every minute of our relationship with her. Between working and living together I was never without her to keep me grounded. (She has since come back to give our relationship another final chance.) I am a heavy smoker, both tobacco and herb, and have been for at least a decade. One morning earlier this year about 4AM I couldn’t sleep so I drove a couple blocks to get a drink from the gas station. On my way back home I got pulled over and arrested for possession of a controlled substance and unlawful use of a weapon(s) and was facing jail time or other severe punishments as well as living the rest of my life as a convicted felon. My mom paid for me to be represented by a good lawyer in my town and he has been trying to get a deal for me this whole time. I told him the first time I met him with my grandparents that I have been interested in serving in the military my whole life and was in the process of trying to enlist when this happened. He told me as I was leaving his office that if I was serious about joining the military, he would get all 4 felony and all 5 misdemeanor charges dropped. I laughed and said ok because I didn’t believe him at all. I’ve been predicting that I would have a huge fine, supervised probation, or jail time. I got a call earlier this week saying that the prosecution FINALLY came up with a plea deal for me. The judge is going to drop and remove ALL of the charges I have gotten in his county from my record on the condition that I join the military in the next five months. If I don’t join they will come back and prosecute. Harshly. I couldn’t believe it but I obviously took the deal. I have gotten my soulmate back, gotten a great local job and was promoted to replace the crew leader within 2 weeks of working for the company, and fought through a lot of struggles this year.

19,"This is kind of long but it’s so funny that I’m this stupid I feel like it’s worth it idk 

My friend and I hadn’t talked for like a month so one day about a six or seven weeks ago I reached out to her. I was like “hey is everything okay, did I do something?” because I had snapchatted her recently and she didn’t reply so I was a little worried that maybe she thought I was being an asshole for not texting her in a while. Sometimes my friends think I’m mad at them when I’m being distant when actually I’m just lazy at texting, so I wanted to check in and make sure we were both just busy.

Now, I was very emotional when I had texted this, I was having the worst PMS I had ever had like to the point where I was crying and felt alone and thought everyone hated me and it lasted for about a week. I had taken an ambien to sleep before this and stayed awake and it made me even more emotional. My hormones are still really out of whack from medication I had to take a few months ago. I had convinced myself that she was ignoring me (even though I also hadn’t texted her and I wasn’t at all ignoring her) and I was being irrational in my mind. I’m usually very level-headed and stable so I felt embarrassed that I was being paranoid and embarrassed that I had texted her making sure everything was okay, I thought I sounded clingy and weird.

Basically, after I texted her that and felt embarrassed and annoying I blocked her number because I decided that I didn’t want to know what she replied, if it was bad or good I would just pretend like it never happened and unblock her in the morning and I’m sure things would go back to normal when I wasn’t feeling so crazy. For some reason this sounded like a great plan. Well the next day, I guess I had forgotten my plan. I forgot that I blocked her. After a while I genuinely thought that she was just ignoring me and had ME blocked. I had literally no idea why or memory of what I had done. so I deleted her number because I was feeling petty and still hormonal and figured she didn’t want a friendship anymore. I kind of thought she was crazy or something but told myself hey I tried to reach out and make sure everything was okay so there’s nothing else I can do, not knowing that I probably blocked her before she could reply. 

It’s been about a month maybe 6 weeks and for the last few days I’ve been kind of remembering that I blocked her. I didn’t want to believe that I could be that stupid, and I don’t know why I’m just now remembering this, but since I deleted her number when I thought she blocked me, I don’t know if she’s in my blocked list. I have a ton of numbers blocked bc I used to get a lot of spam calls every day. I’m pretty sure she is tho.

Anyways, I’m a fucking idiot. I’m pretty sure she thinks that I blocked her on purpose, probably has know idea why, probably thinks I’m psycho (with good reason) and probably unfollowed me on my socials. I don’t really use the socials she uses much so I haven’t noticed, but wouldn’t doubt it. Part of me wants to try to find out if I’m blocked on socials and reach out and apologize and explain, but I don’t know if she will believe me.. I mean, would I even believe something this stupid? I would probably think I was crazy. I would think that they were totally lying. I honest to God didn’t mean to keep her blocked and was just doing that so I’d forget I sent an embarrassing text, but like even that sounds so weird I don’t even want to explain it. Like, maybe I should just ignore this whole situation lol. For all I know, she never replied to my text and was ignoring me the whole time! Imagine how stupid I would look if I told her what happened and she said that!! Idk what to do, I feel so guilty. I wish I could explain this so that she would believe me and also not think I’m crazy bc it was a really weird situation.

26,"I had to leave work on day two. And I am tired of talking about this because it doesn't make sense to people and they think that when you're 32 and you should get yourself together and be able to do a basic job and not have to walk back and forth between two places because you can't remember a pen or a pallet tag or the numbers.

I don't like that my brain won't cooperate. I can be fine but once it goes downhill, I am three seconds starting to cry and then fine, and then not sure about the time, and then confused because this should have started a half hour ago because I looked at the clock and thought, OK, it's 9:45PM but then 15 minutes later is like 30 minutes later but it's only 29.

How do you tell people you can't count, like I just did 9 times 6 fine 45 minutes ago, but I can't remember how many are 6 in a row on a pallet and be able to count that it's 9 high.

I don't know why this feels harder this year than it did last year. But I can't afford to get the appointment and get the prescription and be doing well all the time until I can afford it. And it's embarrassing. I feel like a child, like people stare and can't process what I am saying to them as anything but a cop out or laziness or just confusion.

I wish people knew how hard it is to socialize. Like when you meet someone and you know that eventually they are going to get to this place where they see how you go from being relatively OK to being unable to take instruction. How many ways can you pick up a box? Why can I do it 45 times right and then 4 ways wrong? And it starts to feel like an announcement. I walk into a room and say, ""Hi, I am fine now. But in a little bit, I could be Fisher Price stupid.""

I'm not dumb. I have a degree. It's not in gender studies. I did 1.5 years of an MS. But I can't just grab the pen and the sticker and take them with me at the same time.

And then how this just crumbles relationships. I used to think, OK, you can meet someone and they'll be impressed by you, because you're usually impressed by other people. But six years. Six years. I can't see it anymore. I don't think about the last relationship like I used to, but I can't think about any relationship in the future.

I'm sorry. They say invisible disorder, but I want to not have these moments where when one thing falls off or like I can't sleep well or if I can't afford to be on amphetamines, and I still can't understand why people who smoke meth say it's legal meth like I just sit here and can't commit to something like a shower two days in a row somedays and then I went to the doctor and said, ""Hey, now I have problems and maybe you can think they're important."" And he just gives me drugs and I go off to the next gay club and PnP with some guy named Greg. But it's visible. Who has to look at a clock twice to understand the time? But they can be a semester away from an MSDA.

Why doesn't this get easier? I got the gay thing, then the effeminate thing, and then the bad family because managing money must be a postmodern artform, but also this?

This is sober. All of it. When you know what you can do but see what you can't, and you know that you can wrap some damn shrinkwrap around a pallet because you can take years of pipeline data and build a revenue forecast model on one-offs, not MRR.

I nees to go lie down. But I wish I could tell people how much I don't see even a willingness to give me something less the doubt. How much I like how good my jokes are but I don't know why I can't tell any today. I wish my boss could look at me on day two the same way they did on day one, and not seem like they just watched a full grown adult act like a child. And I wish this didn't cost so much. I wish it didn't have to cost so much to get help. Because it's stupid that one 20mg pill can make everything great. I was never even like this between doses.

OK. I just needed to say some of this out loud. And I feel bad. I was OK and then it just crashed and got worse. And I still don't know why people think I am irresponsible or lazy or whiney when I was just exceeding expectations and helping and getting along well.",28Sep2019,1

32,"Please help me. I'm in great pain. That's a throwaway acc. Obviously.

I worked for a company where u had to get up at 5 am because work started at 7 am and I had to drive a long way.

My bowels never adjusted to that time. And I couldn't take a dump in the evening. I was also too embarrassed to shit at work. 
So that left me with constipation. After (only) 3 days I've had enough. I tried drinking espresso in the evening to get rid of that excess food waste but nothing worked. So I forced myself to shit. 

It worked. It hurt. I'm an idiot. 

I didn't think that far to use a laxative. Because I was used to shit every. day! at 7 am my (w)hole life I thought it had to go at that point. With force. So I could go on with my life in peace.

After that day I knew it couldn't go on like that. So I finally made the decision to poop at work at 7 am when I arrived every day. It kind of worked. I never got caught. I'm a female so it isn't that common or accepted to poop in a public restroom. 

So that was that but the damage was done. It still bled and it still hurt. So I ordered oil for that specific area. It worked one week. Than it lost its power. 

Weeks go by and I finally. I finally went to the doctor. Calling was embarrassing enough but going in... oh boy. 
I went in, told the lady at the desk (around my age, I'm 21) I had an appointment and got to the waiting room.

Then it was my turn to wait in the examining room. Doctor and again a women in my age came in. I told him my story. I had to get naked and sit in this gyn like chair. Then the examination. Hurt like shit.

After that he told me it wasn't that bad and I didn't need an OP right now. I got a prescription for a creme.

I had to use it 4 weeks. In those 4 weeks I didn't have any symptoms at all. It worked wonders. 

One week past and it started again. I booked an appointment. The doctor said I could have another prescription but it should be healed after 4 weeks. This time it didn't worked as great. And I had booked a control visit exactly after those 4 weeks. 

This time it was another doctor. He asked me if it got better and it did. I mean I'm not in pain and not bleeding that much. But it's not healed I can feel it.


And that is it. Today it started bleeding again and I really don't want to go to the doctor any more. 
I started at a new job a few months ago so I can finally shit at 7 am in my own home with nothing but peace.

But once again it's not healed. I don't know what to do any more. I can't get over the fact that I, a 21 year old female, might have to get an OP performed on my stupid butthole because is was constipated for 3 days. I've seen videos where women put Dragon dildos up their asses. 

How should I tell my work that I have to stay home because I need to get my ass stitched?? I know I'm not at that point but with my luck nothing will help any more.


So here's my wonderful story about a 21 year old women who ripped her ass not because of kinky stuff but just because she didn't wanted to shit at work.

33,"English is not my first language so I'll try my best to make this post as clear as possible.

I don't know since when, but I cannot trust any men I met anymore. Being friend with them is ok and quite easy, but to be in any kind of further relationship is like a plague to me. It's more like mental problem, and I think it's because of my past.

When I was at a very young age, one of my cousin (at least 18 years old I believed) took me to the kitchen and touched my vagina. I had no idea what he did at that time, so I was just simply standing there until I got bored and ran out. Nobody in my family knew about this since I somehow felt like there was going to be big trouble if I told them everything. The cousin lived very far from us so I didn't see him very often. However, I felt disgusted and angry whenever I saw him. But I just can't told my parents what happened.

I'm not really a beautiful girl, even in the past. In my high school's time, many boys in classes made fun of me because I ""have a hot body but ugly face"". No boys ever stood on my side or told them to stop. No one. And I hated them. I knew they were just kidding and having some fun, but that hurt me a lot. 

There was a group project our teach asking us making a short video represent every members in the group. Our group leader was a very beautiful and famous girl in class, but she knew nothing about video editing or contents. She gave out some orders for us to do, and I already tried to tell her the video wouldn't work that way. I used to make several of them in the past so I knew the difference between thinking out an idea in your head and actually turning it into reality. But she just didn't care and all the boys simply listened to whatever she said. I and another two boys had the responsibilities to edit the video in the end, but both of them too busy playing LoL and telling lies to me about their computers could not installed the video editing program. I had to did everything by myself on very last minutes because they waited until the very last day before the presentation to send me the videos.

Our project were graded by the other groups as well and most of them gave us a very low grade because our content wasn't exciting at all. And that was when the leader put the blame on me. She said it was because of my awful editing skill that our group had such bad grade. Because the leader could grade other group's members so gave me like the lowest grade in compare to everyone else though I was like doing most of the project solely by myself. The boys stood on her side, criticised me for everything. They were using their words as swords to pierce my heart. I told my teacher, who was also a men, everything. But instead of giving me advice or talking to those group's members, he simply said it was my fault for being agressive toward such events like that, and it was ""normal in your life later after you graduated"". 

Later, I knew that my father cheated on my mom. I heard relatives telling story about their husband cheating with some other chicks. I read many post about failure marriage from women sharing their life's stories. I was drowned with disbelief and depression. 

I worked part-time at a food court when I was attending college. Most of my male workers would talk to me normally, but it was much harder for me to ask them doing something (which was obviously their jobs) than a pretty girl. I had to do all the hard work by myself without any notice or help. Even when I told them to do their sh\*t, they acted like not hearing anything because they were all lazy. But guess what, if that was the order of a cute girl, they would do it right away with a smile on their face. I simply didn't understand. It wasn't like I asked them for anything. I was just telling them to do their jobs which they were getting paid for. And men acted like I had to beg them using my beauty or otherwise they wouldn't do it. 

So that's the problem, and it was just some examples from my life. I lost my belief from family to relatives to friends and even to co-workers. Though I have some male friends I'm still in contact with, most of them are gays or bisexual, which make me more believe straight men are assholes. I know that thinking is wrong, and not all men are the same. But I feel insecure whenever I try to date someone because my brain keeps telling me they're just pretending to be good, and they will harm me in the future. 

What should I do? I have tried many ways but cannot get rid of the fear about men. I've never been in any kind of relationship, not even having a crush on someone. I don't like guys judging women by their appearance so at the same time I hate myself for thinking negative things about all men just because I had some bad experience in the past.",28Sep2019,1

41,"I’m going to tell my lucid dream experience , it was a nightmare. For starters I didn’t get even 2 hours of sleep. (Im awake now) As I was sleeping, I was lucid dreaming. It started off with me feeling like I ate the most potent edible in the world, no I’m not trying to be funny, I felt off, like almost wasted. i just felt stupid high throughout my whole nightmare. I got in my car and was off it, I felt really bad because I’m actually in a point in life were I’m somewhat close to making my family REALLY proud of me (actual life). So I was driving and I was telling myself I hope police doesn’t stop me, that’s how bad I was driving. Anyways, I arrive at this pizza shop?, with a cousin who was already there, and like I stated previously, I was off , something was wrong with me, I was like heavily intoxicated but still remembering things. I went to the bathroom and looked at my face in the mirror, and popped like 5 pimples that left puss in the mirror which ended up disgusting me. I went back to my Table, and was essentially being held up only by the wall. I fell a couple of times but got back up. Then we ended up in my house. Now it was me , my cousin (pizza) , another cousin (cuz B) , my sister and baby brother 😞. As I was talking , still fucked up , my sister came over to me laughing. She told me, would you eat my ass or ????? , no kidding, Me still being in a lucid state I said the other option, the ?????, (can’t quite remember what she said). While this was going on cuz B and my baby bro were sitting on the floor all while my baby bro had a water bottle . Somehow he managed to open it spilling it all on the floor. Instead of dispersing into different directions, it all fell in the same spot , creating this puddle. My poor baby bro fell face first into it while cuz B looked at him not doing shit like a dumbass. This angered me and I jumped into cuz B from the bed with his face now facing the water and I just smacked him across the back of his head. In a fit of anger , he stormed out WITH my baby bro. While I was attempting to compose myself, and did for a while, I noticed they were Gone. This actually (irl) sped up my heartbeat . All while I was sleeping, I actually felt my body doing this.I felt the veins from the top of my head pump and travel down to my body where once the reached my chest area, it pumped my WHOLE body, this went on for a while. And I guess while this was happening my dream setting switched, now, it was me running really fast from my backdoor out to our porch and hopping the chain link fence looking  around franticly then going back in the same manner, REALLY REALLY fast, in an attempt to find my baby bro. ( imagine a house on a corner , with a sidewalk right out the fence.) I felt the veins pumping, I felt my heartbeat going real fast all while I was asleep and I couldn’t find a way to wake up. That’s until my dad came in my room asking me to take him to work. I honestly believe , hadn’t it been for my dad, I would still be in that hell, with no way out. 

Clarification , no , my cousin isn’t like that, nor my sister. AT ALL. It’s just weird dream things , were I guess they were the only people my mind could’ve thought about at the time. 

When I drove my dad , I dropped him off and on my way back I actually had to break down a little bit, it just felt so real. I’m good for the most part now.",28Sep2019,1

After class we go for a walk and I am always left by myself making me feel as though that I don't want to go to yoga anymore. I feel helpless at everything and that there is no use of trying anymore. My job is a dead end and people at work don't like me. I live in a place away from friends and I have a family that is selfish (my siblings all left home to take care of my mother who has cancer from when i was 15).

I was waiting for my friends at the bar. And i found out my ex best friend was coming, and thats when it hit me hard. 
I couldnt breath, my heart pounding and my eyes shuting down. I had a weird feeling as if i need to burp but when it came it was like i was gonna throw up. My brain fussed, and my legs were limp. I had to drink and i drank, a lot. When they came, my panic was gone. I saw my friend and put my hand to shake, he turned his head and shook it back. I didnt care anymore. I didnt have a hard time. He didnt look at me the whole night. He everted his eyes everytime he accidentally looked at me. It was weird. But it was good. And im glad it happened. I am glad to see him for the last time. My trust was broken and thats what gave me the anxiety. He broke it and i still had the fear. It was my first time trusting someone. And it hurt when it crashed. I was always bullied by all, but this was different cause i trusted him. But i saw him. Just a guy as everyone else. Not someone far and unattainable. He did laugh at my jokes. But he tried not to. I didnt try to talk to him or anything. It was fine. It was fun. And im glad he shook my hand. And am glad he looks happy, but he did gain weight... just a little :D

On top of that I’m managing schoolwork which is only getting heavier as time goes by. It was for the best that I quit, but I can’t help but feel like a failure, pathetic and like a loser. I’ve been fired from if not quit every single one of my jobs so far except **one,** and that’s the job I have on the beach over the Summer. It’s the only job I can withstand and is actually manageable.

I don’t know how I’m going to manage later in life when I graduate college and am going to have to maintain a job to pay rent. I just hate being pushed and ordered around and being treated like I’m nothing. I know they’re my bosses and have the right to do that but I take it way too personally, I’m way too sensitive. I know the better decision would have probably been to suck it up, be a man and not quit this job, but they were not willing to cut my hours and it was taking a toll on my energy and mental health.

God bless I didn’t need this job to survive. I hated it so much. It gave me so much anxiety and I’m going to search for a better job that I can better manage instead. I wasn’t a very good valet anyway...I just want to get a job I can manage and maintain. Work is just so hard for me and I don’t know what to do. I’m too sensitive, I have been my whole life and I just don’t think that’s going to change. Somebody give me a wake up call or something, or share your thoughts.

51,"So I'm in college and I'm enjoying the life. I like having no strings attached to anyone or anything: I just do my best at uni and have fun with friends in my spare time.

Disclaimer: I''m a bit of a party animal.

So there's this guy from uni, and I'm pretty sure he like me. His name is Max. We made out when we were pretty drunk and high on weed. I liked it, didn't think nothing much. I like kissing people and I do so all the time.

I'm sure Max likes me, a really close friend of him told me he does and I get the vibes as well. He is a super sweet guy, I'm just not sure I'm THAT into him. Sure I like him, but don't want a relationship anyway. But then again, I don't know if he just wants to have sex or really commit.

So this was all a week ago, now flash forward to yesterday. I went to a house party and he was there too. The thing is, I was SUPER drunk. I can't even remember half of the stuff I did. At this party, we made out a bit again and he bought me and my two friends drinks. I remember him telling me something along the lines of: you're hot and awesome please go home with me. I don't know what happened after that.

Anyway, I go the bathroom and chat up with some other friends of mine. I suddenly see a specific friend of mine, we hook up a lot, he's sort-of my go-to bootycall. I hadn't seen him in a while, and I don't even remember why but we started making out and I went home with him.

Meanwhile, I remember seeing Max look at me kissing my fling and looking SUPER sad. I saw him walking out. Again, I was super drunk and didn't do anything. He sent me a message ""have a fun night"".

I feel so bad. I made such a dick move.",28Sep2019,3
52,"I (15F) had a crush on one guy on my school bus last year. I observed him for a long time, and he seemed like a really kind, friendly, and genuinely great person. I really wanted to talk to him, but circumstances never lined up. Also, whenever I did have a chance to say something, I’d always start panicking and I would miss my shot. 

I planned on talking to him this school year. I had an elaborate plan on how I’d start a conversation with him, and finally get to know him. I spent so many months over the school year, and the entire summer perfecting the plan. I’d make sure that I had a plan for every outcome of what could happen. I felt very prepared, and confident. I was super excited to talk to him.

Well, sophomore year started. I was really looking forward to starting up a conversation with him on the school bus. But here’s the catch... he wasn’t on my school bus anymore!! We stopped at his stop, but he was never there!! I began feeling really sad and hopeless. Where was he? About two weeks into school, I found a way to access a list of all students from my grade in the school, and he wasn’t on the list. So he wasn’t at my school anymore. I asked my friend who goes to the other most popular school in the district to check if he was at her school, and he was not. At this point, I felt like my whole life was coming to an end. This boy was the only thing on my mind for so many months, and now he’s gone. He disappeared off the face of the earth!

Luckily, I had a backup plan. Last year I found his school email, and I kept it as a last resort. If anytime was a last resort, it was now! I sent him an email talking about how I wanted to talk to him last year, but never got the chance, and that I feel really bummed about that. I also asked where he was? 

He didn’t respond for a long time. After a week went by, I was sure that he wasn’t even in my school district and thus didn’t even check his school email anymore. I had given up. No more hope was left inside me of him replying. 

However, a while later, I checked my school email after school, and bam!!!! He replied!!!!! He responded two weeks since I sent him the email, but still!!! In the email, he apologized for taking so long to reply, he told me which school he goes to now, and he also apologized for never saying hi to me on the bus either. 

Ahhhh! I just feel so happy! This happened a few days ago, but I’m gonna email him back today. I’ll ask him what made him decide to transfer to his new high school. I’m just really filled with joy. I’m going to try getting him interested in talking to me over email, and after a while I would like to ask for his number!! Frankly, that might not happen for a while, but I’m still very excited to see what the future holds!",28Sep2019,1
53,"Its been almost 3 years since my ex and I broke up and we are both in good relationships now. I never felt I had closure within that last relationship though so in order to succeed in my current relationship I felt I needed to wrap things up. Not sure if that makes sense. My ex and I used to say we were soulmates. I always thought that it meant I couldn't find a bond with someone else like that but I've been doing some reading to help better understand my feelings in attempt to amend  them.  I couldn't bring myself to shoot a text or dial for a call, I wasn't sure if that was the best move. Instead I found an old Facebook group we had made together as best friends years ago and posted a message about my discoveries and how I've chosen to heal. I honestly feel like he still has some deep wounds from our relationship and I hope that my findings could help him. It seems like he's doing well but I just have this feeling that he may need something from me to exhale. Like an apology, I left it in the group because if he saw the notification and felt he didn't want to read it, he could easily ignore it or read it whenever he felt ready.",28Sep2019,3

Now that I've apparently betrayed my parents' trust and have irrevocably damaged our relationship, I have to consider a few things.

1. Move out. Obviously, seems like the ideal choice. Involves a lot of adult responsibilities and planning.

2. Kill myself. Not as ideal, but oh so alluring after months of being mentally healthy and balanced, medicated, and enjoying life more than I have before. God, how sweet the appeal. Pills, hanging, asphyxiation, cutting, placing myself in horrifically dangerous situations-- the memories are now all coming back. I could get rid of everything at once: my school work, my parents' mounting anger, my frustrations with their inflexibility.

I realize now-- they absolutely do not care about anything I do as long as I play the role of their perfect daughter.  I think I'm at my wit's ends. I don't know what to do, I just want to sleep and sleep and sleep and I don't want to wake up.",28Sep2019,4

60,"I really want to be better; I'm not happy with the life I have made for myself. 

My energy is too weak ... too weak to be near school, too weak to be near work, to weak to be near friends, too weak to ever find a lover. Social connections are difficult to achieve and impossible to maintain when you are made of such weak stuff. I speak the language of fatigue, eccentricities, lonesome quirks, and daily struggle. I'm that terribly quiet loner you saw, but never recognized. Was he actually there? What did he look like? Nothing – just a short, skinny, nobody. He had no face. 

Yeah, that was me. 

There's probably a serious mental diagnosis at the root of everything. But what do I know. I'm terrified to ascertain the truth: maybe it's nothing and I was really just a pathetic, sad, strange, little weirdo the whole time. And if not, would I even still be me – the unique, idiosyncratic individual I loathe and love – if medicine “cured” me. 

But some days ... some days, the pain of alienation, friendlessness, self-imposed isolation, unemployment, virginity, being Forever Alone and forever NEET in seemingly eternal social exile ... well, it just cuts too deeply. And some scars just don't heal. 

It's been an empty season (again) ... mostly that was okay. But all around, society seems to be crumbling and no one cares. I'm a selfish beast for only in the briefest of fleeting moments pausing to care myself. But even my ephemeral attention for things Greater-Than-Myself easily eclipse that of my family. Maybe I just need to get more sleep. 

I've honestly lost fun – and that's a bad place to be. How do find happiness after you've misplaced it? I can live without love, without friendship, without ambition. But I want to feel the small joys of little bits of fun again. Too much isolation, no doubt? Enough rambling for now. Tomorrow is another day.

I *can* be better. I just have to somehow force myself to want it badly enough.

So how do people who have successfully surmounted the challenges of self-improvement achieved such motivation in the earliest, nascent stages of their journeys? I get that I have to first accept my limitations, and then push beyond them ... but what if you feel too weak to push? What do you do then?

Perhaps part of the first step is accepting that I am already in a state of constant flux – maybe not growth, but *change* at least. That change can be harnessed in any sort of direction, right? No matter who you are, you can always change ... you can always transform ... you can always evolve (or devolve) ... no one is truly stationary. Was it Heraclitus who said you can't step in the same river twice? The river is constantly flowing – in motion ... and we, as living beings, are constantly changing, growing, and evolving. I'm not the same man I was even back when I started writing this long-winded, pretentious, voluminous, pile of lexiphanic, periphrastic logorrhea (yeah, I'm a pompous try-hard). But anyhow: time flows on, your mind wanders to different islands, and though it *seems* mindless ... it's intrinsic to the whole introspective process of growth and change.

Nobody can stand still. Doesn't matter how hard you try. We're all in motion.

So how do you harness that natural flow of life and make it work *for you*, pushing you in a positive direction of emotional, spiritual, and personal growth and maturity? I desire a catalyst for ambition ... an impetus for inspiration ... an incentive to motivate and push me in the direction of good and proper, strong, healthy growth.

It's not about a competition: we're not trying to be better than the other guy ... nobody's talking about merely keeping up with the proverbial Joneses. I'm used to everyone around me being mostly better than I am. And I don't think there's anything dignified or impressive about beating the other guy. I want to find a way for *future me* to outwit and achieve victory over *present me*.  Can my tomorrows become superior to my yesterdays? How do you make the most of *you*, in the here and now?  I'm already forever changing my mind – fluctuating,  shifting, swaying, and oscillating back-and-forth about this, that, and the other thing. And that is transformation of a sort.

So, can you make those little changes work for yourself?

Can an apathetic, indifferent, passive layabout like myself channel, tame, and exploit this as motivation?

My energy is too weak ... but I've gotta stop using that as an excuse.",28Sep2019,4

My parents went to a wedding and left me (a 21 year old guy) and my sister (16) alone. We decided to have the burgers for dinner so we drove to the store to buy the buns we'd use for burgers.

As teenagers do these days, they have to fucking document every single thing they do on social media, so she decided to take a couple of selfies while we were driving (she was in a passenger seat.) And okay, you know, I let her have it. 

So we bought the buns and started driving home and were relatively close to home when she decided to take another photo and put the phone in front of herself and didn't hold the phone with her hands. The shitshow happened when the phone literally flew in front of my head and almost went through an open window on my side (driver's seat). 

As you would expect - it startled me and I turned the wheel and we drove up on a curb and almost drove into a ditch nearby. Luckily, I kinda managed to keep my cool and stop the second we hit the curb, so nothing happened to either one of us, or the car, for that matter. Only thing that happened is that a plastic top of a single wheel guard fell off and I managed to put it on.

But 'what if' scenarios keep running through my head. What if we hit a person, or a post, or flew into a ditch, etc. I hope the shitty feeling passes soon... 

And FUCK the need to put everything on fucking social media. I wanted to fucking kill my sister...",28Sep2019,6

84,"I'm a newly turned 18-year-old who's just gone through a semi-mutual breakup with my SO of 3 years after having moved into a shitty apartment with them, as well as a mutual friend and their partner. Our roommates aren't too keen on me staying due to the lack of space in such a tiny apartment now that we aren't together, but my SO has made it clear that they'll allow me to stay as long as I look for new places to stay and leave as soon as possible. Only problem is...I've exhausted all my options when it comes to places to live. My family disowned me after a back-and-forth dispute between me and my father escalated into me getting kicked out of not only my own father's house after he had done his usual routine of showing up drunk at 3:00 AM and being a total prick when I had my first batch of 10th grade finals in the morning, but also my grandmother's house after an argument turned physical between me and my granduncle that sent me to CPS until I turned 18. With that, and the fact that I have very few friends (If any of them can truly be called that.) as most of them have moved on since I dropped out of high school, I have nowhere left to go. I can't drive because family refused to teach me before they disowned me, and my job laid me off during the first week of moving in.

I've never talled about the girl to anyone before these rumors started to come out. The only reason she started to say them was because she has an issue with a different friend of mine. 

She's a popular girl with a lot of friends so the rumor spread fast. She got a few of my friends to believe it including one of my best friend who's a guy. 

I talked to the girl about and she claims it was a misunderstanding and that she would clear things up.  She hasn't dispelled any of the rumors and it's really messing with my mental health. 

I talked to my best friend about everything and how I'm just really sad about everything that's happened. The entire time he defended her saying that she's under a lot of stress and she's dealing with other people talking badly about her. He then started to say that I need to accept responsibility for what I've done (I haven't talked about this girl to anyone except my therapist and some really close friends. The only other times she been brought up in convo. is when people tell me that they heard her talkinh about me). 

I'm really sad because I thought I could trust him. He said he's just trying to be the voice of reason but it just seems like he believes the rumors that he's been told. 

This seems really silly to say but I have a private spam account on Instagram where I vent and talk about a lot of personal things. I was recommended using it as a diary-type-thing by my therapist.

99,"I'm not a fan of her music. Just want to let that be known. Believe it or not, it doesn't really matter. I do know that people understandably find her public persona grating. Most public personas are. I believe however that that alone was the main motivation in people trying to get her ""cancelled"" by distorting something she said and making it out to be something that no one really knows about for sure. I can't stand it when fake news spreads and people are treated unfairly without any discernment or diplomacy, regardless of whether it's a Grammy-winning multi-millionaire or a poor wretch from Whereverthefucksville, Idaho.

This past year, someone dug up an old Instagram live of Cardi B recounting times when she did less than reputable things to get studio time. ""Hoodrat shit"", if you will. I remember seeing the live, and she was talking about these incidents with tears in her eyes, clearly remorseful about what went down. At least that's what it seemed like to me.

She was talking about when she was a teenage stripper and the upstanding patrons of the titty bar or strip club she worked at would bring her back to their place, where they would proceed to get high and have sex, then she would rob them afterwards. Clearly, not a very moral thing to do.

Someone who doesn't like Cardi B and finds her public persona grating might come across this and feel like they've won the lottery. Finally, they can spread the news that Cardi B is a rapist, and she drugs poor innocent blameless men (going their own way, I might add), and then rapes and robs them, snatching away their hard-earned money that they need to feed their wives and children who love and support them. Oh happy day! The evil Cardi B has been destroyed by fax and lawjik! She's the female Bill Cosby everyone!

Nevermind that what she said happened happened when she was a teenager. Nevermind that it would make zero sense for a stripper to drug or rape a guy when a guy is probably more than willing to host a stripper and have sex with her without force from the stripper herself.

NEVERMIND the fact that Bill Cosby abused his already established power and high reputation by drugging and raping all of those women. Nevermind the fact that that's what sociopaths do: build up so much respect by being charming and fun that when they do something reprehensible like drug someone and then rape them while they're unconscious, those victims question THEMSELVES and not sociopath who did the shitty thing. 

""Bill Cosby would never slip something in my drink and rape me! Would he?? He doesn't need to do that! Besides, he has a wife!"" Then a second victim comes forward. And then a third. Then a fourth and so on and so forth. All of them thinking the same things to themselves: ""Bill Cosby is a beloved figure in popular culture! Why would he risk his career by doing something so heinous? I'm just being ridiculous. It must've been someone else or... There must be something wrong with me. That's gotta be it. Because Bill Cosby is America's Dad™! Jello Pudding Pops! Ugly sweaters! He makes goofy faces and talks in a silly voice!!""

All of those women endured systematic abuse by a piece of shit comedian who couldn't be satisfied with his high status. Some random guy posted a comment on a Facebook article about the Instagram live Cardi B did, and straight up LIED about being drugged and robbed by her. Whenever he clarified in a later comment that he was ""joking"", it was too late. The ones who already didn't like Cardi B took his original comment and ran with it. They needed to let everyone know that their disdain for her is actually justified. 

And then when you point out that the comparisons to Bill Cosby are unfair, they say, ""She still robbed them!,"" as though that alone warrants someone's entire career and reputation to crumble.

I had to get this off my chest (but I can't post in the actual subreddit offmychest because I replied to a comment on thedonald and offmychest mods moronically ban you if you post there no matter what the context is). I had to offer this perspective for those of you out there who have come across the news about this and automatically ""cancelled"" Cardi B personally. I know it's not really a major news story or that big of a deal really, but like I said, I can't stand fake news and people being treated unfairly. Yeah, Cardi B might've unfairly robbed men, but I don't think something she immoral did when she was a teenager should follow her as a more mature person and damage her career regardless of how abrasive and loud her persona is. Just my 2¢. Forgive me for ranting this much about something so dumb.",28Sep2019,0

The more people from various body types and various activity levels I can get, hopefully the better my project will be.

102,"I never liked women. But not because I’m a homosexual or asexual.
I’ve never had a good relation with women at all. Not even when it came to simply friendship. Not only were women completely disrespectful to me but I started to dislike them even based on how they would behave to others.
Girls never liked me at any stage. The same guys who bullied me in high school or college or work were the same guys that girls flocked too. Seeing this as a young teen made me see how women weren’t these angel-like creatures that society would drill in to our head (growing up, for whatever reason a lot of male figures would always pain girls as innocent and boys as rascals, I had internalized that idea). If anything, they are quite insidious. They reward douchebags, thugs, lowlifes with sex. They give them an incentive to remain a doucebag. It’s the whole reason you see so many good guys trying to act bad these days by desperation getting a tan, shitty tattoos, leather jacket etc. It’s all to feed in to this bad boy fantasy that women have. 

I struggled a lot in teenage and young adulthood (asides from the issue of women). What made this stage especially shitty was hearing feminist babble endlessly about how I’m privileged as a man. Go fuck yourself. 
Now a lot of people think guys are simply resentful towards women because we can’t get a girlfriend. That’s not true. I honestly feel like I could get a partner. Even as an average-looking 5’6 guy, I could probably get a partner if I did some steroids, got in the gym, dressed well, etc.

The issue isn’t that. It’s that I know I’m not really desire to women and I don’t want to fall for their phony bullshit. It’s an uncomfortable truth but women really aren’t sexually attracted to their husband. It’s the reason why dead sex lives are so common. And hilariously men eat this garbage up from women about how they just aren’t sexual. Seriously? You really believe your wife who was whoring around with all the boys is now suddenly just losing her sex drive. Here’s the real reason, women manipulate men.

They don’t have sexual attraction for the guy they settle with. He’s a provider. He’s at most a gloried friend. She let other guys use her up but you have to pay the big toll of marriage.  Most women shamelessly pretend like this is normal. I’ll whore around a bit with the jock type guys and then I’ll settle with some dud who will pay for my stuff.
Here’s what I don’t get about men today. How the fuck are they okay with this? One, how are you okay with having a whore kiss your children. Two, how are you okay with knowing that she would never have wanted you in her sexual years back in college. Please answer this for me. Unless, you’re a Chad like guy, the reality of it is grim.
So women get to have to the most optimal mating strategy. Sleep with all the jocks, then milk some dud long-term. Meanwhile, men are shamed for just wanting sex without commitment. If I tell a women, I just want sex, that makes me a pig. But a woman can have her way without any criticism.

It’s not just the manipulation. As far as even personality or behaviours, every little thing that women do would just piss me off. The way they laugh or gossip. Their holier than thou attitude. Their virtue signalling and sanctimonious bullshit. Worst of all, is women trying to pretend like they are funny like men. Their feminist policing of society.  Don’t even get me started on the bullshit double standards. They complain about body image standards when the male body image standards are FAR more unrealistic. They complain about body shaming on social media yet the SAME girls shame men for height, weight, penis size, etc. Holy shit, working with women is a nightmare. The insane amount of favouritism will drive you nuts if you’re not their gay friend or the hot guy. I haven’t seen this level of favouritism working with men. Even racist guys I’ve worked with are better than this.

Now I already know that people will accuse of me of painting all women with one broad brush and WHAT ABOUT THE GOOD GURLZ? The “good girls” piss me off more than any low-class self-admitted street whore because they put on a phony act of being virtuous while being no better morally. They drip with phoniness. A lot of who I thought was “good girl” were the same type of women who would flock to the bully jock type. They wanted those guys just as much.  Of course, there is the phony cabal of women on reddit who pretend like they don’t like jocks and they are actually attracted to nerdy 5’6, 130lb guys. Here’s another about women I don’t like: phoniness. Women would like this would absolutely want the jock type guy but they know they can’t get him. 

Part of what fuels my dislike for women is how they are coddled in western society, yet are also portrayed as victims.  Men have higher rates of suicide, depression. It’s hard for them to get admitted to certain programs or careers because of gender quotas and affirmative action. Meanwhile, I don’t see any of those quoatas for men going in to female-dominated programs. On top of this, women consnantly attack men simply because of how a few guys at the top benefit.

The incels are clownish and borderline autistic when it comes to some of the things they say but the undercurrent of their words has some legitimacy. As a man, you really are only valuable based on looks to women. Men are foolish to believe that having a nice job will get them women but it only attracts a golddigger who wants his resources. The incels at least cut through all the bullshit. It really isn’t a surprise to me how their ideology attracts people. It’s liberating to cut through all that crap you hear about “how women are so open-minded and they like men for who they are, only men care about looks”. Bullshit. 

I already know I’m going to get many troll comments or unoriginal comments like “fOunD tHe InCel” or “MaYbE YoUrE gAy”. That’s fine but it’s clear to me that people try to avoid the central thing behind what incels say. They only take their lingo and surface talking points to paint them as insane but they don’t bother to dive deeper in to the issue. Where there is smoke, there is fire. I feel it’s partly because there is some consideration that what if this morbid reality that incels talk about is real?

Honestly, I know some people will call me gay. But honestly, if being gay was a choice, I’d take it. I respect men. I don’t respect women.",28Sep2019,0

I was scared. I didn't think I was gonna die, but I was afraid  my brain was being fried or something. I started to think ""it's only temporary"" and to do mindfulness and breathing exercises, which I think may have helped. I concluded my mind was ""twisted"" and I needed to ""put it straight"" , and the only way to do so was *staying* in the physical world, connecting with reality. And I was like, come on I'm not gonna be this high forever, it'll stop feeling this intense soon.

And it did, but it was so fucking scary I hugged my dog like there was no tomorrow when I was finally better and able to be with him.

105," Gonna try and keep this short. For those of you who don’t know about Wim Hof or his teachings you can just look it up, he is basically a guy who broke a gazillion INSANE records of going through extreme temperatures. He has a breathing technique that apparently boosts your energy levels, along with cold showers and stretching. 
    About my self: I’m a high school student (M) who likes trying out weird shit and found this method on the internet... and just wanted to vent online for whoever wants to try it, knows at least what happened to me.
    So during the breathing... I got a LOT of muscle tension. I could barely move the muscles on my hands, face, and shoulders towards the end. They were literally like frozen in that position. I never, at any point, lost consciousness but, my body was just doing its own thing. On the side note... it made me EXTREMELY horny. Like 🤷🏻‍♂️ maybe I’m always like that and just idk summoned a demon? Ok stay with me... my thoughts and senses were ENHANCED on an insane level (during). Everything I was thinking was yelling at me, but i still maintained to be in control and fully aware of my surroundings. I would usually do it before a work out or before bed and i would feel SOOOO refreshed  and at ease. In terms of performance I would usually be able to focus more but nothing out of the usual. The stretching and cold showers progressively became less intense the more I did it and, now are almost therapeutic.
   Thanks for reading! Wanted to share this for a while, have been doing the method for about 5 months or so and I think it’s been a helpful influence in my life. Definitely have a good ventilation in the room you are in, if your gonna try it out. Once you do it give your self like 5-10 mins to get back in the loop. Maybe do some stretches(it is a intense experience for some)Make sure to do your research! Thanks for staying around and have a beautiful rest of your day! ❤️",28Sep2019,2

110,"So I was on the phone with my dad today while driving doing errands. I recently moved several states away for work, so we were catching up. We recently picked up a 4x4 from the shop we’d had working on it since we bought it, to make it nice and everything we wanted it to be. At first he was using the truck’s Bluetooth, but it’s so loud that I was only hearing every third word so he pulled over and shut it off so we could keep talking. Since it turned off, he switched from Bluetooth to his phone.

After a few minutes of us talking, there was suddenly what sounded like a loud bang, so loud I had to immediately reach for the volume and turn it down. It was a constant kind of static-like sound, and a few seconds later another sound started that sounded *fucking exactly* like the horn on the truck. I couldn’t hear anything else, and so I’m sitting there thinking something went horribly wrong with the truck and it either exploded (as sometimes horns get stuck on in fires/accidents) or something similarly awful.  After about twenty seconds of listening to that while shouting his name, the line disconnected.

Fortunately he called me back a few seconds later and I was relieved to talk to him again and realize everything was fine, and it was just some kind of horribly bizarre glitch. But it was fucking horrible, and I don’t know what the hell it could’ve been.

I \[M/16\] (excuse my mistakes, i am not a native speaker) am going through quite a tough phase right now. I am not depressed at all and consider myself to be quite emotionally stable. But over the past few months i feel like i‘ve grown too much into overthinking and self doubt.

So it begins in september last year. There is this girl, who i kind of fell for. We had a joint group of friends but didn‘t know each other too well. But apparently she also had some feelings for me. At least her and my friends said so. So the situation was the following:

For the following 2 months the situation was quite weird because we both knew that we had feelings for each other BUT:

I didn‘t make any attempts because I wasn‘t getting any signals from her. It was just my and her friends telling me, that she is quite into me as well, which isn‘t the best basis for any further steps. I didn‘t get any signals from her and I am also quite shy in these things myself so I barely made any attempts and she did neither because she was really shy herself (eventhough we both are generally quite extroverted people). When I was celebrating my 16th birthday in november, she got a little drunk (we are from germany, it‘s legal here). Then she made first, very obvious attempts, which i didn‘t take, because 1st she was drunk and 2nd I was overwhelmed in that situation.

So there happened nothing between us that day. So days and weeks went by, until i found out, she wasn‘t that into me anymore. (We’re in december now).

Then I took my courage and talked to her about my feelings the first time. She told me she was sorry and she wished it would have come earlier but shes just not into me anymore. I accepted and since we were friends as well we tried to remain at friendship. This didn’t work too well for me, eventhough I never showed it. I talked to her quite a few more times about us and we remained friends but this thing always stood between us and eventhough my feelings for her vanished slowly, they never fully disappeared. So over the year my feelings vanished slowly but we both didnt talk too much, especially not about our situation. I found my feelings going up and down, sometimes I was thinking much about her, sometimes I felt like I was really over her.

About three weeks ago we went to a party of a friend and she seemed quite sad (she did occasionally on parties) and I talked to her first about her being sad but the conversation drifted of and somewhen we also talked about our difficulties in having a normal relationship for the first time. I told her that I had no feelings at all for her (I know not that a great idea) and we agreed to just let the past behind us. That may sound too simple but at first it worked and our relationship did normalize indeed (at least imo) and I thought at first my feelings really did vanish.

I think you all know which word comes next:

BUT,

last sunday we went on a class trip to Dublin so I would spend a whole week with her. We did have a lot of contact, talked a lot and one evening just the two of us spontaneously went through the streets of Dublin and had a nice talk for about half an hour or 45ish minutes. During this class trip my feelings came back very strongly, I guess but I wouldn´t dare to talk about it with anyone, just like I didn´t talk about it with anyone for the last year. I neither want to speak to my friends or her because I´m really insecure about this and I feel like 1st i´m giving up a part of how I see myself and how I want other people to see myself by showing hard feelings (eventhough I know thats quite dumb) and I don´t want to ruin our friendship and look to needy and desperate.

I think I can´t express my feelings properly in English because I couldn´t explain them even in German nor to myself. I´m kinda in a dilemma because what ever I do, it feels wrong. If I don´t talk to her, I will experience the feelings of sadness and self-doubt of last year again and I feel like giving up on me and embarassing myself by talking to anyone I know because they know the situatuion and all feel like its over for 9 months and I seem to be the only person to still think about it.

Not being able to talk about this is really frustrating for me and intensifies my self-doubts in every sense so eventhough I think I am quite self-confident, its always accompanied by self-doubt.

I feel like I need to talk to someone and if I won´t talk to someone I know, I´ve got to tell it to strangers on the internet and hope, no one I know browses r/self.",28Sep2019,1
