1,"I'm tired of everything. I'm depressed, I have no friends, I don't go out because it's not fun to go out alone and not be able to drink, because of health problems. All I do is sit at home doing nothing and now my platelets are dropping again and I kind of just hope I'll bleed to death and die.

I don't feel like ""fighting"" or whatever, I'm just done. My life is garbage enough without the autoimmune bullshit, life isn't fair and I don't feel like living it anymore.",06Mar2019,2
2,My girlfriend recently broke up with me. I can be very toxic at times and I’ve recognized it for a while. I’m so heart broken that she left me but I understand. I was looking for a therapist a year ago but ended up giving up because I couldn’t find the right match. I’ve suspected I have borderline personality disorder and I found a therapist that specializes in exactly that. I start Thursday and I hope she can see that I am ready to start the journey of getting better and perhaps take me back into her heart. ,06Mar2019,1
4,"I was born into a big family (9 Kids), which for the most part has been utter hell, except for brief moments when the gloom dissipated, and I could feel happy, I could feel something, then as always the moment passes and the gloom once again shuts out the light, leaving me in utter darkness, miserable and alone. I do not want to come home to this place tomorrow, but I do not know what choice I have. I'm tired of the noise, the constant hum of conversations somewhere in the house, the noise of foot steps going up and down the stairs or through the house, the clinking of dishware in the kitchen, the flushing of the toilets, the constant bickering of my brothers/sisters, the constant bitching of my parents. I'm tired of bathroom sinks covered in tooth paste spit and smelling like a sewer, I'm tired of the giant wads of female hair in the fucking shower, I'm tired of not being able to sit down and read a book leisurely without having to play my music incredibly loud to drown out all the yelling outside my room. I'm tired of screaming, asking for silence when its 9pm and I have to wake up at 3am for a job I despise, I'm tired of having no god damn privacy, no where to take a girl, no where to talk with a friend. I want to go to college, but my parents want me to start a career at a factory or construction and move out. I feel like I'm being pushed out, and I'm not sure I could even make it through college living at this house. but I want to go, id kill myself if the only option I had left was to work somewhere I HATE and I feel is unfulfilling. I'm getting tired, really I am, but I hate it here, I hate being around people, god what id give for permanent silence.",06Mar2019,1

6,"I am a very self critical person currently going through some bad stuff. Ex cheating on me and sleeping with me and immediately breaking up with me kind of stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've repetitively hurled accusatory and harsh words at him through my pain and he has had enough. I've made the wound deeper out of self defense and lack of trust.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been going to therapy for this and to battle the trauma caused by infidelity and the physical trauma, and working on myself, but occasionally I spiral like this.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't trust myself as much as I used to and don't know how to go about life anymore. I'm afraid people won't like me, i'm afraid to pursue my interests, I'm afraid of other close relationships in my life. Although the rest of my life has been going particularly well, i always spiral back to negativity when this persons actions come to my mind. I'm afraid to stand up for myself because I may come across destructive in even small things (I haven't). I feel like a bad person that I am upset with someone who hurt me, is that weird?

&amp;#x200B;

And obviously, I feel like shit compared to the innocent, sweet, perfect person he cheated and moved onto. Considering my immaturity and pettiness, she probably seems like a saint.

&amp;#x200B;

People say doing good things will often make you feel better over time to replace the bad, and i've attempted that. But my actions still linger even if they came from an emotionally raw place at someone I probably won't trust in my life ever again.

7,"Title says it all, really. But I suppose I can spare the time to write out some backstory. Sorry in advance, I'm sure this'll just be a ramble.

For as long as I can remember, I've hated myself and I've had suicidal thoughts. Nothing I do in my life seems to work, but the area where this seems to affect me the most, is relationships, or just chatting with girls in general. 

I got off of a 3 year relationship a few months ago, because for the last year, I felt nothing, I was just scared to be by myself and I kept telling myself she was the only person capable of loving a person like me. Then, I started trying to get myself out there, talking to girls and all that, because it was something I had never really done, ask girls out on dates. As a result, I met this other girl and we got along quite well, but she eventually lost interest in me after a couple of months, and I keep thinking that maybe it wasn't the that it was her that I liked, but the fact that it was someone giving me attention, making me feel needed, making me feel wanted. 

I've been told that this constant attention I seek, the constant feeling like shit when a stranger I barely even met, stops talking to me because she's lost interest, might be related to me not Caring too much about myself, so I'd like to know what I can do to atleast start trying to care a bit more about myself.

Everytime someone stops talking to me or loses interest, I feel terrible, I feel like I wasn't enough and that if I had a better personality, better looks, of I was a better person, maybe they wouldn't have lost interest.

Again, sorry for this whole unnecessary rambling, just needed to vent a bit, I guess. My question stands though.

TLDR; I'm not very confident with girls, and I deal very poorly with rejection/loss of interest because I yearn for the love and care I cannot give myself, and I reckon I should change that.",06Mar2019,1
8,"Recently I feel like all of my friendships are one sided. I’m always the one initiating contact. No one ever asks to hang out - it’s always me asking. I get bailed on but they never reschedule. I sometimes get tagged in memes which is nice, but that’s it. Do they not like me anymore? Are they too busy for me? Am I really not worth an hour of their time?",06Mar2019,2
9,"My mom wouldn't let me just not care for the stupid vote on the 1% sales tax. ""It's your duty to me as my son to come and vote against the sales tax"" she told me, while I wondered whether or not she was joking. I eventually just went with her because I didn't need any political speeches trying to convince me to vote. My initial thoughts were ""So it's an added sales tax for basically nothing? Why would I vote in favor that?"" This was part of why I didn't want to vote, simply because I didn't know the reason for that tax. 

When we arrived at the voting place, I got my ballet, and for the first time, I saw some valid reasons for such a tax. It said that the tax would go to help repair roads and bridges, which I would gladly pay the extra sales tax for (there were several other things that I forgot, but I thought most of the reasons were more than reasonable for such a tax). As of late, the roads in the area have been riddled with potholes, and the sooner those go away, the better. So I voted in favor of the 1% sales tax, the opposite of what she wanted me to do.

When she asked me what I voted for, I wanted to be honest, but then again, she would lose her shit, and I wanted to avoid experiencing her aggravated response. So I told her I voted against it. But now that I'm typing this, I see a valid reason for being honest. She wouldn't ever force me to another vote again, seeing as I vote for things she doesn't want.",06Mar2019,1
11,"Hey folks, hope you're doing well in whatever timing you're in!

Now I'm not certain in in the right place for this, but I just wanna talk about some thoughts I've got, see if anyone else is in the same place as I am. And if anyone's made it to a better place, they could offer their guidance.

I think my perception in my life is limited by what I know in my own little universe, I'm looking for some alternative viewpoints on life, different ways of looking at things, ways I can't think of. Im ignorant to so much of what goes on out there, guide me Reddit. 

I'm 28[M] from the UK. Things aren't exactly tough, it's just that they haven't changed in a long time, I've been working the same God damn fast food job for 10 years now. For 5 years I went to University, put work first too often, got a 2:2 BEng and struggled to find any work in my field, I never liked it, but it's what my parents wanted. So for another year or 2 I looked for jobs half heartedly, while not fully committing to my current job, I would be leaving, why would I want to become a store manager? I gave up looking, focused on another career that interested me, a police officer, I failed the fitness test. Then I fully committed to my job, was about to become store manager, then our store got bought over, I didn't meet the requirements for them however they honored my existing contact(or so I thought, conveniently paperwork went missing and my title was now manager in training, not assistant manager). Time passed and I was getting messed around by the new company too much. My interest lapsed, I was looking for a way out with the idea of retraining for the Police. For whatever reason I decided that I'm just not a fitness guy and the police didn't really suit me. I moved onto my next venture, programming. I've paid a lot of money for a programming course and I've never felt more bummed out which brings us to now.

I live with my partner and Im finding it hard to find the time and the drive to complete my course, she paid for the course, she also paid for the last holiday too. Work has been a nightmare and it's using up headspace even when I'm not in. Life gets in the way so much, we have to get the shopping in, change the sheets, Hoover, walk the dog, dishes, washing, Cousins getting married, grans not well, don't forget to see your nephew's, when are you going to visit, why don't we talk anymore. It's just all so much. 

Our sex life is non existent, but we are trying to fix it.
I've been working at the same place for pennies for 10yrs
I've got £10k debt from uni
I owe my SO £5000 from holidays and programming courses
I always wanted to enter the wrestling industry but I'm too old
I don't see friends anymore
I hardly see family
Works been mentally tough recently to the point were I cried over not being able to cook potatoes
I can't be bothered with so many things that used to bring me joy.
I feel like I'm always on edge, always waiting on someone.
I feel like I have to always be listening, if I get in the zone with someone and someone says something, all I know is someone said something to me and I'll ask them to repeat and it's always a louder and angrier tone.
An old love interest called today and we just talked for a bit, it was a nice change of pace. And other messages me and we talk and it's enjoyable. I only mention this because it feels wrong.
I've got a lot of love in me that I have no outlet for. 

I go to bed every night thinking about death, there's only so much time we have and I feel absolutely worthless. I'm looking for guidance, people to chat to and help shifting my perspective, because surely there's more than this?

14,"I am a nineteen year old male in my first year in college. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for several years now. Everything good that happens to me is always overshadowed by some insecurity or negativity. 

I have a girlfriend that I have been with since middle school. We both go to the same college. I do love her. She is there for me a lot. However, I feel like I am missing out so much on life. I never really got a chance to go out and date, have heartbreak, and experience the alleged high of fresh new relationships. She also gets pretty jealous, so it squashes many prospective friendships with other girls. I often get small crushes on other girls, knowing that I will never act on it, but it would be nice if I could.  I know I would be crazy to leave my girlfriend, she does a lot for me. However, it’s killing me that I can’t see what all is out there. 

I feel disgusting for having these feelings. I don’t have many friends, and spend a lot of my time secluded in my dorm room in my thoughts about what I could be missing.

Now I'm in college and I wanna go back to high school or middle school, or maybe grow up and get some stability and a family. Wherever I am either sucks ass or is okay but not as fun as it could be. The only two times I've been completely satisfied was in middle school when I had a best friend and high school senior year when I had a girlfriend and befriended a teacher and had a few fun classes. I feel like every step of life is promised to be great, like having a bunch of friends in high school and all the fun stuff at college, but once you get there it's shit. Everything's over-hyped and never as good as previously. I also feel like I've wasted my life. Out of middle school I had no friends and barely made any in high school. Out of high school I had one girlfriend and zero friends, and now that's all gone too. I've wasted my life wishing for the future or the past and while doing so failed to accomplish anything in the present that will last. I have no friends but a couple somewhat friends now (they won't last, nobody ever does) meanwhile other people have friends from their childhood and have thirty good friends on snapchat and a group of close in-life friends.

well i notice girls faces are VERY pleasurable to look at, very cute faces. like, their faces stimulate my visual cortex in a delicious way, eye candy, eyegasm etc.

i dont talk to ppl because that would be weird. but i look around my classes before class starts and notice that the girls in the classes have very cute faces. i dont look for more than a split second cuz they would be creeped out if they catch me looking. we're all just strangers who signed up for the same class so it would be weird to look. like, we dont even know each other.

&amp;#x200B;

the weird thing is, i have this pleasure response for almost all females faces, but only a few male faces. most male faces are just meh/boring to me. i know that attraction to faces can't be the motivator for platonic friendships, since platonic friendships are often between the same sex and heterosexual. males are friends with each other even though they dont like each others faces, so there must be a pleasure of talking that i don't grasp as well as visual attraction

I am 24 years old, and I live in the US, in Missouri. I've lived here my whole life, except for living in California being stationed there in the Marine Corps. I was in the infantry. I love NHL hockey, the Blues, the Tampa Bay Lightning, and the Washington Capitals. I'm watching the Lightning right now, and they are in intermission. I love animals, cats, ferrets, cougars, jaguars, koalas, sugar gliders, hamsters, rabbits, foxes. I have a cat who lives with me who is really unique. I'm an extreme extrovert, I have been told I am individualistic, a freethinker, an uncomformist, an independent thinker, and someone who would make a good psychologist. I love going to concerts, writing, composing, and making my own music, songs, lyrics, I've been rapping since I was about 10 years old.

I psychologically question everything, I am a conceptual, abstract thinker, I have been told I am a psychologically-minded person. In university right now, I am triple majoring in biochemistry, clinical psychology, and political science(international relations), the more competitive I can make myself, while making something of myself, the better, the merrier. I am a lone wolf, who doesn't believe in or agree with groupthink, the sheep mentality, just taking what everyone else, society tells me at face value, following the same thought process, path, that everyone else does, and everything. I always like to become to learn about broad, vast subjects, then using that knowledge in a specific, immediate area, instead of being critical, focusing on a small scope of one subject, if that makes sense. I don't believe in owning and using Apple products; such as Macbooks, iPhones, Apple Watches, or any Mac OS whatsoever, unless I have to. I go to college every other day, and I see everyone has iPhones, Macbooks, Apple Products, but I wonder if they actually know how to use these things competitively? I have no social media footprints, accounts, whatsoever, besides Reddit but I personally don't believe Reddit is social media entirely because your identity is still anonymous, for the most part. I practice operational security, but I know I'm not perfect. I believe in anarchism, relying on yourself completely, only trusting what you know, I don't willfully watch the mainstream media, the news, watch TV and I don't even have a television anymore either, except for my favourite shows some other way, more confidential, anonymous, underground. I believe in whistle blowing, transparency, truthfulness, and human relationships. I feel like it is a very, very sad world, sad life for those who literally do the same thing, the same job, same routine their whole entire lives, but never better themselves, their situations, their lifestyles, because life is too comfortable for people in their comfort zones for them to ever even begin to think about abandoning it, doing what scares you. I have been skydiving before, I have run 4 half marathon races before, a sub 5 mile. I also have been training in the discipline of Wing Chun Kung Fu for years. I believe I don't have a comfort zone inside myself. 

I have British, Irish, Finnish, Swedish, and French-Canadian background. I will be travelling to Iceland in just a couple weeks for a week, for the first time. I love European culture, history, music, geography, people, women, languages, etc. Speaking of culture, I love females, women, and everything about them. I love famous actresses like Claire Danes, Caroline Dhavernas, Natalie Dormer, Jessica Chastain, Noomi Rapace, Rebecca Ferguson, Emily Blunt, Chloe Grace Moretz, Ashley Benson, Lucy Hale, Claire Foy, Rooney Mara, Sienna Miller, Kate Mara. I am planning and hoping to travel to Finland, England, and Czech Republic respectively in the next year or so. 

I was raised by psychopathic, narcissistic wolves...unfortunately. But I am just myself at this point. I have a subreddit on Reddit called, ""RealmofDarkPsych"". The link to my subreddit, which is about the psychology of psychopaths, murderers, serial killers, and criminal justice articles, as well as the psychiatric, neuroscience perspective on Psychopathic Personality Disorder is here for you- [https://www.reddit.com/r/RealmofDarkPsych/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealmofDarkPsych/). It is NSFW, 18+ due to the extremely disturbing, clinical, dark, gruesome nature of the area of forensic, clinical psychology. I have completed psychological profiles on the sub of Jodi Arias, Chris Watts, and Israel Keyes, so far. I am pursuing a doctorate in forensic psychology because of my background, life experiences, upbringing, my gift of extreme human empathy for others, and my extreme passion for psychology, and human relationships, and our pursuit of understanding, I have a letter of recommendation which says, in my administrative professor's own words, ""...And a giftedness in the area of forensic psychology,"" that understanding and empathizing with psychopaths, psychopathic mind, is my pervasive gift. To link to the first real post on my subreddit for whomsoever reads this post here in r/self...beneath here-

The writings from this post are posted below(psychological profile for Jodi Arias)-

Jodi Arias Psychological Profile/Psychopathy Checklist- Revised(PCL-R):

1.) Superficial Charm- from multiple available sources, Jodi Arias comes off as an independent, charming, narcissistic woman. She is more on the extroverted side, she knows how to make herself attractive for her audience, be it the news, the court system, the jury, etc. What she lacks in human empathy, she disguises her lackings in superficial charm and sophistication, humanistic characteristics such as remorse, sympathy, concern, and meticulousness.

2.) Egocentricity/grandiose sense of self-worth- Jodi has a disturbingly high sense of self-worth, importance, superiority, self-preservation, and a brilliantly shocking false sense of entitlement. This is not my opinion here. From reading prosecutor's Juan Martinez's book, ""Conviction"", watching the court footage of her criminal trial and her behavior during the trial, as well as the multiple interviews she took part in for the news outlets in question, she genuinely seems to believe that she deserves to live, that she deserves freedom, and that everything has to relate back to herself, completely. All these things are perfectly justifiable reasons for why Jodi has such an astoundingly large false sense of self-worth and self-preservation.

3.)Proneness to boredom- knowing the extroverted, exciting, aggressive, and relentless lifestyle she seemingly enjoyed so much, we can deduce that she had a proneness to boredom, so much that she had to continuously find interesting, short-term, high-energy things to do to entertain herself due to a low capacity to sustain an interest in one or more things over a long period of time. Indicative of Psychopathy for sure.

4.) Pathological lying and deception- Jodi Arias was determined to be a pathological liar, systematically deceptive, and essentially unable to tell the truth, even when she was confronted with hard, physical evidence and truthfulness that she had committed a crime, or committed wrong doing one way or another. During the criminal investigation process of Jodi, police detectives and psychologists learned that Jodi came up with several implausible, unrealistic, false stories of how her ex-boyfriend was murdered, that for example, there were ninjas who had broken into his house in 2008, killed him, but let Jodi live. Expressing that Jodi is incredibly incapable of telling the truth, which is frighteningly related to Psychopathic Personality Disorder(PPD).

5.) Cunning/manipulativeness- Jodi wanted what she wanted, and she was overly-predatory and competitive in her pursuit of getting what she wanted. In wanting TA all to herself, she would damage his property assets, hack his computer accounts, harass his friends, and harass him, by making false persecutions and using her religion as justification of her persecutions. This type of rare, yet unhealthy, toxic behavior is even further indicative of one having Psychopathic Personality Disorder(PPD).

6.) Absence of psychosis- Jodi being a high-functioning, intelligent psychopath, lacked any volume of psychosis. Even though her lack of criminal and forensic sophistication would suggest otherwise, as well as her pathological stories about the things she was accused of being guilty of, she used her apparent detachment from reality as equipment for her situation.

7.) Lack of empathy, remorse- Jodi does not feel or have any touch or fiber of human empathy within herself whatsoever. She does not feel any remorse for her crimes and destructions she'd caused her victim's family. This is a primary component of Psychopathic Personality Disorder(PPD).

8.) Lack of affect, emotional depth- Jodi lacks emotional depth from within herself, on a personal, emotional level. She displays and oozes shallowness, and a superficiality of internal and external emotional composition. She may be cognitively-emotionally intelligent, super hyper-self-aware, which mean that she is extremely quick and excellent and perceptive at reading people, she has a sense of style, and a competitive nature, but this is all significantly a result of her Psychopathic Personality Disorder(PPD).

9.) Failure to take responsibility for self and actions- clearly, once again, Jodi behaviorally is incapable of taking responsibility, accountability for herself. This is enlightening to Psychopathic Personality Disorder(PPD).

Determining Arias' score on the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised(PCL-R) is difficult to do because she is a complex and dangerously violent individual. We are not yet forensic psychiatrists, investigators, clinical psychologists, including myself, and so we cannot declare a score one way or another on the spectrum of such a rare Personality Disorder. You want to speculate, you're welcome to do so, and I recommend you guys to do so. 

 love questioning everything on an intuitive, relationally skeptical, level. I like reading about politics, primarily the Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigation into President Donald Trump, the United States Department of Justice's(DOJ) press reports on their website, I like reading non-fiction books, mostly about the mass surveillance police state type condition the United States is currently in, works such as ""A Government of Wolves"", ""The Snowden Files"", ""The Most Dangerous Man in the World"", about Australian lone wolf whistleblower, Julian Assange, who both founded and engineered the extremely controversial fifth estate platform, ""Wikileaks"", ""No Place to Hide"". I believe I have worked at and developed my skepticism, investigatorily questioning everything skill so pervasively, it is its own independently functioning thing in my mind. I believe I have an ""Extreme Skepticism Disorder""(ESD) beyond the levels of the seemingly healthy. 

Even as pervasively skeptical as I am, I do not believe in, nor entertain conspiracy theories whatsoever. Conspiracy theories breach the threshold of reality, sanity, imagination, and possibility. Skepticism does not always refer to philosophy. It is unhealthy to believe in and think about conspiracy theories because you isolate yourself from your well being, and the finer, greater parts of life and the real, external world. 

To be skeptical is to be skeptical of the irrational, one who is irrational lacks good faith and a position in his own reality. For example, why is it I notice so many girls around college similar to my age with their faces buried in their fucking smartphones literally everyday, all the time? Do they have boyfriends?- Yes or no? If so, is their relationship that unhealthy and close that they need to message each other obsessively? What is it like for them to be in a relationship together- is their boyfriend an actually good, respectable dude or an asshole, hardcore badass, thuggish ruggish killer who had spent time in jails before? If so, why did he go to jail for in the first place? His girlfriend considers that attractive or not? Did he have some precious little story for her that made her fall for him, feel empathy for him? What did he get charged with since he got thrown in jail? Has he potentially been to jail more than once, or not? What happens if I approach this female and start a conversation? Will she just ignore the fuck out of me? Will she say she has a boyfriend or not? Will she actually talk to me, and look me as an actual human being, rather than a little boy who has no social skills or potential for medical school and the real world, when I clearly otherwise do? If so, why would she look at me like a little child who's not worthy enough or bad ass enough? Is it indicative of narcissistic? How does she interact with other guys, how does she treat them? Investigate and question everything psychologically.

There is no consequence for thought in the world. Love is selfish, love is pain, pain is love. Bruce Lee once said, ""...The most dangerous one in the world is the one who listens, thinks, and observes."" I am an extreme extrovert living in a world of extreme introverts. 

I understand this post contains an extremely crazy interesting level of information, and content. But this is therapeutic for me, and is the essence of my thought process, emotional depth. Thank you so much, self, literally. Fuck society, fuck the news, fuck the mainstream media, fuck it all. 

Please tell me, have you ever felt yourself like you have so many different, broad, unique, individualistic interests, that you are super unsure of what you could do for yourself? If you know, please tell me, 'cause I'd like to know. Tak, danke.",06Mar2019,2
33,I'm so confused. I don't know what to do. I don't even know if this is the right place to post. I was told to come here by some other redditor. Bless his heart. I'm so conflicted. I feel like I want to use my life to help animals and to make them better and to find them homes and to help them in general. I just don't know how I might be able to get to that position. I not as young as I should have been when I should have started this journey. And I know that I I don't have any excuse to not do what I want to do... But I feel that I'm a little too old to get into the position that I want to be in and I'm too late. I feel like I'm way too late.,06Mar2019,1

38,"I used to be very socially active, easy-going with everyone else guy. I had so many close friends, good grades, and met a nice girl. Everything seemed to be on my side, considered myself as a lucky successful one. Until..
My friends drove away from me.. I couldnt understand.. I tried to step up and tried to confront them. They all ran away from me. I was so lost. I became more quiet, got depressed sometimes, but still happy for what i had that time. At that moment i realised that everything is temporary. I got more careful about friendships, barely made any new friends. One by one my close friends turned away from me. Its kinda painful that you dont know what you did but still people run(not literally lol) from you. 
Aaaand broke up with the girl that i've been dating for a year. I cried. Cried like a girl. Its so traumatic when you are going through this bullshit, and still have to act like nothing really had happened. Im sad. I need help.

39,"I am genuinely curious about how people feel about this idea so I will provide my philosophy in snippet form in order to provide at least the gist 

My argument is simple: The brain runs its processes based on predictions, therefore control the predictions, control the brain.

That's the theory - the living experience of this philosophy is that I have run through a gambit of different perspectives of why of I have control and the more angles I have encountered (which have felt like ""a-ha!"" moments) the more CLEAR the control has become.

Concrete applications:
- Being creative (audibly hearing songs in your head, or seeing the picture on the page before drawing)
- Immediately choosing to get zoned-in to work
- Choosing to be happy

I am person that is always trying to find an easier/better way to do something (call me lazy :) ) and this is what I came up on how to do life.

Please let me know what your thoughts are! I would be happy to expand/clarify if anyone is curious. Just let me know!

43,I’ve began to noticed that under the influence of drugs I’m able to express the words I want to way better than when I’m sober. I’ve been a little buzzed on rum with a dab pen and I’ve tried acid and both have seemed to work nice but I need to rekindle my relationship with a girl that I desperately like but don’t talk to anymore. Things were good we were in the talking stage of the relationship with a little “physical activity” then all of a sudden it kinda ended abruptly we are friends still but it doesn’t seem right and I feel like if I just manage to talk it through with her correctly it’ll work out so what substance should I use to get me in the right frame of mind to have this conversation with her.,06Mar2019,1
44,"I have had a great uncle - gandfather's twin brother- who inherited the rights of his brother in law who did write a famous bestseller and my Uncle was the translator into English.
He has left a Will in which there is a sentence concerning the fact that his next-in-kins live under Russian occupation and if they cannot be contacted the inheritance goes to a friend who has a Foundation in a benevolent Art cause ( their artist father's PR). 
My Uncle died in 1980 but at thet time in 1981 the Russian Empire was already beginning to crumble and anyway some of my relatives lived in free France. It could be proven by witnesses like ex Secretaries of the US who visited our coubtry regularly from 1978 on. Even my Uncle has visited in his last year. So he must have known that contact was possible then with Soviet colonies. Is there a better subreddit to find the legal cadre of such a pozencial case? ",06Mar2019,1
45,"I have a very weird relationship with mental health because I often have a tendency to over think things. But I have a serious lack of motivation like I get decent grades in school and it's not a major major issue even though it does effect me and I know that I'm smart enough to be getting  better grades. I just feel so just empty all the time and not very opinionated at all. Like someone could walk up to me tell me I'm going to get hit by a bus tommorow and I wouldn't care at all. A lot of the time when I feel just super out of it, it's not like I'm extremely sad or depressed I just feel empty, like someone has put a wet blanket over my emotions, their still there but their muted and more distant, when I'm like that it's harder for me to be happy and a lot easier for me to get angry at myself or just think I'm a failure. And it feels so easy for me to just go lay down and not move for hours which is what I feel like doing now. Not asleep just not there because honestly I feel like shit when I'm like this. Its not fun at all wanting to just lay down and do nothing. And the worst part of it for me is not even feeling like this, I can push down and ignore my feelings and suppress them, even though that's not the best to do, its just wondering like is this normal. Am I depressed, do I have some other sort of mental health issue, am I just a lazy sack of shit, do normal people feel like this sometimes too or am I just overreacting? Not knowing what's wrong with me and how I can help myself is horrible. And these like little episodes I have they just come out of nowhere too. To an extent I always feel pretty hollowed out but never like I'm cursed by the wet blanket, just 30 minutes ago I was feeling fine getting homework done and now? I just really want to lay down. And this happens so sporadically too the last time I felt this bad was around two weeks ago and I just really don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. ",06Mar2019,1
46,"I’m a 20 year old guy and I’ve never been in a relationship, or been laid or anything. I’ve made out with 2 girls, one I was too drunk to remember and one I was so scared to go for it she actually had to tell me to just kiss her already. Clearly I’m not some kind of lady’s man lmfao.

Recently though there’s this girl my friends and I hang out with at the weekend that seems pretty interested. She friends with like my friend’s girlfriends so we see each other quite a lot. I’ve known her for a couple of years, and at first she honestly just seemed like some unattainable girl who wouldn’t give me the time of day. She was ridiculously hot. My friend had a thing for her so that made her even more of a no-go in my eyes.

Now though he’s moved on and has a girlfriend, and every time we’re out her and I flirt like hell. On two occasions I’ve been told she wanted to take me home. In the last few days we’ve been snapchatting back and forth and just talking shit. The thing is, while I find her insanely hot, I have no feelings for her at all. I’ve known her for a long time so I know she’s a bit on the crazy side and honestly sometimes I think her personality just kind of stinks. She’s one of those people that just lives for drama, even though they say over and over that they don’t. 

Another issue is that I’ve had a massive thing for my best friend for like a couple of years now. I won’t get into that too much, but let’s just say that there’s basically no chance of anything happening between us in the near future. She has a boyfriend, she knows how I feel, and while I think something might be there and I really do have feelings for her, I can’t put my life on hold waiting for her to maybe one day decide she wants me instead. I’m not some ‘Nice Guy’ who thinks if I stay friends with her forever we’re gonna have some kind of happily ever after, she’s my best friend and if that’s all it ever is I’m happy about it.

Anyway, essentially I’m in a kind of ideal situation on paper; there’s a hot girl who at the very least probably wouldn’t mind hooking up with me at some point, and honestly I think that would be a pretty ideal way to lose my V card. She’s experienced, but we know each other well and she knows that I’m a virgin so she’s gonna be understanding about it. I just don’t wanna start talking to her all the time and potentially hooking up with her if I have literally no feelings for her. As much as I’d like to hook up with her, the last thing I want is to play with her emotions and make her feel like shit. To add to that, as much as I feel pathetic for it, I’m still kind of hung up on my best friend. I know I have to move on, and this would probably help a shit ton, but it still just feels kinda wrong to me, and while I want to do it, I’m not sure if hooking up with a hot but kind of crazy girl is the way to go. What’s the best option here, should I just go for it, or is it a bad idea?",06Mar2019,0
47,"**Hi all, i was just wondering if you guys can tell me: What motivates you to study or work hard?**

48,"Like the title says I have my first job interview in ages tomorrow afternoon. I moved here in the summer because my dad was sick and spent the last six month helping him out. He passed away last month, now that all of his affairs and belongings have been taken care of I can return to work. 

Here's the thing, my doctor gave me meds for the stress of his illness and passing, but they made me act like I'm drunk. If I take them at night I feel out of it in the morning. Since I didn't want to feel goofy during the interview I didn't take them yesterday and now my nerves are out of control, and I didn't get a wink of sleep.

It's not just that I'm upset about my dad, I'm nervous because I don't know this town well, I tried to research this business but its small and had little info online, so I don't know what I'm getting into. I gained a ton of weight taking care of my dad because all I did was sit around the house with him and eat. My hair is looking crazy, my skin is bad, I need a crown (dentist apt soon) but I swear its making my breath smell like butt, my clothes are obviously snug since I packed on the pounds, and my printer was on the fritz all night so my resume, references and cover letter don't look as crisp as they should... but are passable. Basically, I feel like a complete mess in every way humanly possible.

Maybe I'm being over-dramatic, but I feel like they're going to notice I'm a little rough right now. I don't know what to do, I'm pretty tweaked out about everything and just feel like garbage.

49,"It's been a rough patch lately, (is it still a patch if it's like 2 years?) and my mental health often shows itself by my room being out of control. I've been trying to get it back over the last couple weeks, but the depression and drinking and how much crap it is have been overwhelming. But today I actually got a couple solid hours in, and cleared out a corner to stack bins, and got a good part of the middle of the floor clear. 

I know it sounds small, and I still have to deal with the closet, the space under my loft, and the stash of dishes, but I finally believe it's possible to get my space back in control. My partner had been really worried about how bad it was getting, because I haven't let anyone see it in months. he insisted on seeing it tonight, because he knows I've been trying but feeling overwhelmed, and wanted to see if I needed help even though I don't want it, and he was proud of the obvious work I'd put in. I nearly cried. 

And then I got drunk tonight, and have to do stuff tomorrow, but I think I can stay motivated now that it's getting better. I really have to. I've always been a slob, to be honest, and I have some issues because my ex used that as an excuse to be shitty to me, but it becomes this loop where my space is a mess because my brain is messed up, and my brain is messed up by being in messy space. 

So I just needed to tell someone. It's still going to be a challenge, but maybe I got this.",06Mar2019,6
50,"Why does reddit enable animal abusers so damn much? Why does reddit repeatedly shy away from dealing with toxic people as long as they're the ""acceptable"" kind? 

Normalised abuse is still abuse.

I love animals but never go to any animal-related subreddits because so many people on reddit should not be allowed to have pets because they're abusers, it's 100% about them and the animal has to live with *their* bullshit being aimed at them for their whole life. It's the same with kids, people love to act like they're against child abuse but they're only against other people abusing them. People have such a hard time accepting that they're an abuser and that's why people end up having their animals or children taken away from them by force. Reddit is enabling abuse of animals, *please make it stop.*

If I ever found myself outside the main office of reddit I would be sorely tempted to come inside and give you all a piece of my mind and by mind I mean a hand grenade to your faces because that's what you deserve. Running a *huge* website like this means you're responsible for the kind of stuff that goes on here. Why do you only change things when those things might make you look bad? You killed the jailbait sub and the fat-hate sub and then stopped. There are far more hate subs still going strong and loads of pervo subs, too. Not to mention the COUGH COUGH animal abuse subs where people jerk off about how adorable obese animals are. Eat my shit, reddit.

Problem is I chose a degree in 'something I loved' rather than something I'm good at and enjoy doing in a work context. Ended up falling into depression and failing my 3rd year, eventually returning to my parent's house in my hometown with my tail between my legs. 

Since then I've worked a couple of random jobs but nothing significant. Got fired a few months ago and since then I've barely done anything with myself; I've applied for some jobs and had a few interviews but have heard nothing back.

I'm not really bothered about having a career, and working my way up a company. I want to do some good in my life instead. Something that can help a lot of people, but also suits my skills. I'm pretty smart and have a great work ethic when I know the exact task I need to do. But I also get overwhelmed really easy when the path I need to follow isn't spelled out for me.

55,"I'm referring to the Hyperloop and also Earth to Earth rocket travel that he's proposing on making a reality. I haven't flown for almost 20 years and I believe airplanes are a primitive technology that hasn't changed much in the past 60 years. For example turbulence brought down lots of airliners back in the 60's, and newer aircraft have the same gust loads as the old jets of the fifties, so a new plane isn't improved in any way in regards to strength compared to a 60 year old airplane. That scares me and it's just been a matter of luck that turbulence hasn't brought down more airliners though it did bring down an A300 jet in New York back in 2001. 

A rocket has no wings to break off and I've never heard of there being any turbulence at the edge of space, or rockets being blown apart by high winds.

If you happen to read something in your newsfeed which leaves you feeling angry or upset and decide you have to say something in the comments, but then worry about saying it right or upsetting someone, or people misunderstanding what you mean and then attacking you instead - don't trade all of that anxiety in for an emoji - because soon enough you will have forgotten how to articulate yourself at all - and the next time your emotions are stirred by injustices taking place in the world it will be even more difficult to muster the confidence to say what you really want to say, making it more likely for you to choose the easy way out - taking the entirety of your feelings and emotions and reducing them down to 1 of only 5 possible options.

We're much more complex than emojis allow us to be and we know it.

Not being able to express our sentiments exactly how we experience them, or not feeling free enough to talk openly about topics that may require us to be generous and kind to each other - isn't good for our collective mental health going forward. The system itself in which we communicate (Facebook) encourages us to be less nuanced in our thoughts through the crude alternative of emojis.

Emojis are to language what McDonald's is to food.

We can only be as expressive as the tools that we use will allow, and being able to crystallise in words precisely how we feel at a certain point in time truly is one of the best ways to externalise and then look squarely at, whatever it is that might be troubling or exciting us inside.

So down with emojis and alphabets FTW!!! ",06Mar2019,6

65,"I’m a 20 year old guy and I’ve never been in a relationship, or been laid or anything. I’ve made out with 2 girls, one I was too drunk to remember and one I was so scared to go for it she actually had to tell me to just kiss her already. Clearly I’m not some kind of lady’s man lmfao.

Recently though there’s this girl my friends and I hang out with at the weekend that seems pretty interested. She friends with like my friend’s girlfriends so we see each other quite a lot. I’ve known her for a couple of years, and at first she honestly just seemed like some unattainable girl who wouldn’t give me the time of day. She was ridiculously hot. My friend had a thing for her so that made her even more of a no-go in my eyes.

Now though he’s moved on and has a girlfriend, and every time we’re out her and I flirt like hell. On two occasions I’ve been told she wanted to take me home. In the last few days we’ve been snapchatting back and forth and just talking shit. The thing is, while I find her insanely hot, I have no feelings for her at all. I’ve known her for a long time so I know she’s a bit on the crazy side (that sounds like I’m just being a judgemental asshole, but I’ve seen her make massive drama out of the tiniest things). I can’t really see myself being in a relationship with her to be honest.

Another issue is that I’ve had a massive thing for my best friend for like a couple of years now. I won’t get into that too much, but let’s just say that there’s basically no chance of anything happening between us in the near future. She has a boyfriend, she knows how I feel, and while I think something might be there and I really do have feelings for her, I can’t put my life on hold waiting for her to maybe one day decide she wants me instead. I’m not some ‘Nice Guy’ who thinks if I stay friends with her forever we’re gonna have some kind of happily ever after, she’s my best friend and if that’s all it ever is I’m happy about it.

Anyway, essentially I’m in a kind of ideal situation on paper; there’s a hot girl who at the very least probably wouldn’t mind hooking up with me at some point, and honestly I think that would be a pretty ideal way to lose my V card. She’s experienced, but we know each other well and she knows that I’m a virgin so she’s gonna be understanding about it. I just don’t wanna start talking to her all the time and potentially hooking up with her if I have literally no feelings for her. As much as I’d like to hook up with her, the last thing I want is to play with her emotions and make her feel like shit. To add to that, as much as I feel pathetic for it, I’m still kind of hung up on my best friend. I know I have to move on, and this would probably help a shit ton, but it still just feels kinda wrong to me, and while I want to do it, I’m not sure if hooking up with a girl who I have no feelings for just because she’s attractive is the way to go. Not to mention the fact she really is a bit crazy (for some fucked up reason I find that a little bit hot which will probably bite me in the ass lmfao), and if things get complicated between us I don’t want things in our friend group to get weird. At the same time, it’s not like this is an opportunity that comes up often, and I feel like I’d be an idiot to just pass it by without thinking it through first. So what’s the best option here, should I just go for it, or is it a bad idea?",06Mar2019,1
66,"One man was reported to have had an encounter with a ""group of nerds"" who were playing chess nearby. They had grown rowdy and loud, and an argument took place after the man asked them to quiet down as they were scaring some of the small dogs in the area. 

The man was found two hours later along with another victim and both had been strangled to death with a set of 30 inch thighs.

So I guess with the testosterone flowing the nerds must have gone into a rage and started strangling whoever they could stalk and catch in the park. Scary!


There were two infamous groups of killers strangling people in the park here- the chess club and bird watchers, both full of nerds. They have been known to go on rampages strangling innocent hikers they happen across. The park is considered very dangerous now.

67,I am a 17 year old male about to graduate in a few months and go to college to pursue to my dream of being a pastry chef. I work as a line cook at the 38th best restaurant in Canada and in my opinion the best restaurant in my city. I was a long time dishwasher there since I was 15. When the new year hit I decided to involve myself in the kitchen there a lot more than I did before (I showed up to prep and work for free till my head chef offered me a job surprisingly it only took two days). It took me a while to get a hang of working the line and I still feel like I'm not up to par with everyone in the kitchen prep and service wise. I only work weekends as I am still in highschool and look forward to going there every weekend to work I have had many good services but I still can't find myself working fast enough to work appetizers and desserts by myself to the point where last weekend I got cunted out by my head chef constantly that I put a sad face on the whole service and went outside to cry by the time I had a minute. I feel overwhelmed by this because I know that this is the type of work I want to do I love it but I don't know if I can physically do it (working 12 hours+ a day and barely sleeping on weekends). I recently got pushed away by my best friend of 3 years once I tried to make the move to take the relationship further between us even after I accepted that things between me and her were never going to be the way I wanted it she still pushed me away even more. I feel so hurt by the fact that the person I have told everything about myself to has pushed me away. On new year's very drunkenly she revealed all of her feelings to me and expressed her fear to tell me that as she has always thought of me as a brother I explained to her that I felt the same way but that we should have this conversation in person and sober. By the time we did she just pushed me away more I have completely given up on her but still feel very hurt by it I can't do my job right but I want to my co workers have put so much time into teaching me and putting me in the position that I am I don't want to disappoint them most of all. I don't have anybody to really talk to about this I feel like my mother stopped treating me like her kid once she found out I smoked weed everytime I have an outburst she asks if I'm drugged the fuck out on top of that I have no privacy in my home I want to move out.

I regularly check the delivery progress, and this morning I noticed that it had arrived at a UPS Access Point in a city about 20 kilometers away form me. Great, it should arrive tomorrow then! However, when checking the delivery progress right now, I see that my package is back in Denmark. Why?

This has happened to some extent pretty much every time I have ordered a package, so I'm guessing there's some kind of reasoning behind this.

74,"My FIL will likely die by Friday, although I honestly expect it sooner. I feel horrible and guilty for a number of reasons. Here's where my brain is going: The amount of time my wife is having to take off from work means that there will be no vacation for us this year. We have already had to cancel a trip to Thailand, one we'd booked flights for and spent nearly a year planning for, in part due to her father's illness. We are currently sitting around, basically waiting for the inevitable, in the frigid cold of the American Northeast. I would give anything, \*anything\*, to be on a warm, tropical beach with her right now. We'd hoped to make up for our missed Thailand trip later this year, but this isn't going to happen. 

The worse her dad's situation gets, the more I obsessively plan trips to Costa Rica, Mexico, the Outer Banks, or SE Asia that aren't going to happen any time in the next year. The more we endure the cold and the excruciating wait and uncertainty, the unbearable toxicity of her family, the more I fantasize about warm tropical air, rainforests, beaches, jungles, and so forth. I keep having to stop myself from telling her all about the non-vacations I'm planning that we're not going to take. I know we'll be able to in the future, but that's not much comfort for some reason. 

It has been an absolutely miserable and stressful 12 months for us both, even aside from her father's health. It has taken its toll on us, and both of us want nothing more than to simply run away. I don't know how we're going to make it through the rest of the year with no break in the tedium and stress of day to day life, and I know it will be especially hard for my wife.

I love cooking, I always liked trying new meals and even crafting a dish by myself, but I used to cook only during the weekends.

82,"This is a description of my life:	

Both of my parents have Ph.D. degrees and jobs that require them. I grew up in one of the wealthiest towns in my state, and went to one of the highest rated school districts. I loved to learn in elementary school. I kept reading about things like dinosaurs, rocks, and the Arctic long after we had finished studying them in class. I developed a reputation as the “Smart Kid.” At home, my parents never physically punished me for anything. In high school, I was active in clubs and activities and I even led a couple of them. I was never really bullied, and I could sit with whoever I wanted at lunchtime. I never got in any kind of trouble. I actively participated in my classes, and I won a couple of awards. In the yearbook, I was deemed “most likely to know everything.”

This is also a description of my life:

I grew up in a log cabin on a hillside in the woods outside of a town of about three thousand. It was connected to a dirt road by a gravel driveway. The house didn’t have walls until I was seven, and it didn’t have any doors to rooms until I was nine. When I was a young child, I could be pinned to the bed and bitten by my father at any minute. He seemed to enjoy it. He would be laughing the whole time. As I got older, he only needed to pretend to bite me to scare me. At school, I was designated a “Special Needs” student. There was always a teacher right next to me during lunch and assembly. I was prescribed at least a dozen different medications and the hospital became like a second school to me. Starting in junior high school, I was put into special classes and I was required to go to the “Learning Center” during my free periods, where there were instructors who would decide what I needed to work on. Those same instructors would be in most of my classes. In high school, I never went to anyone’s house without it being for a school project or school activity. I only ever received one phone call, and I only left the house without my parents for something that wasn’t school related twice. At school, I was put in “Speech Therapy” and I had to attend weekly “Social Group” sessions. At home, my father routinely told me that I would end up in jail or on the streets addicted to drugs because I was making the same mistakes he made. I ended up going to a university that is seen as being more working class than others.

Or better yet, if you have ever suffered from depression or felt overwhelmed by life, maybe – just maybe, there is a nugget or two of truth in here that helps you!  

And sorry, there is no TL;DR.  I think the heart of this story is worth a few minutes of reading effort.  If you don’t have that time to give, I surely understand.  Skip to the end and watch the video and leave birthday wishes if you aren't interested in the backstory.

My Father is an amazing man and is directly responsible for all that I have been able to accomplish in my life.  He turns 90 on March 8th and I wanted to do something special to celebrate his life.  The story that follows is the Life Adventure I have been on to accomplish that task.  Hopefully you will be moved by the story and will help make this a special gift for my Father at the end of this post.

Seven years ago, when my oldest son was 16, he had a little garage band.  Now I have no idea where he got his musical talent but that boy just started playing guitar, keyboards, drums – pretty much anything.  

We built him a “music room” in the bonus room above the garage and he and his band would play all day and night on the weekends.  Those were really good times.

Now I don’t have a musical bone in my body.  I’ve never played an instrument and about my only experience with music had been singing in the shower and in the car when commuting to work.  But my son’s excitement about music inspired me and I began writing lyrics while I was driving to work each day.  I would give him the lyrics and he and his little band would turn them into songs.  It was fun, interesting, and a great bonding experience.
About that time, I wrote lyrics about my father’s life.  Those lyrics just sat on my phone for a year or two.

Then in 2014, my father was turning 85 and the family planned a big surprise party for him.  I decided maybe there was something that could be done with those lyrics if I could just find some musically inclined good Samaritan to help turn them into a song.  My son was off to college by now and didn’t really have the interest or time to help.  So I turned to reddit.

First, I began posting around on various subreddits to see if someone would volunteer.  I was relatively new to reddit and really didn’t know the ropes very well and had trouble getting any post traction.  I remember bemoaning the fact that I couldn’t find anyone to help and someone started a subreddit in that thread called /r/makemysong.   I quickly posted the lyrics there to see if someone would bite.  Here’s that original post which shares a bit about the trials and challenges my Father has faced (and overcome) in his life: https://www.reddit.com/r/makemysong/comments/1xn5mg/please_please_please_help_me_make_a_present_for/

Well, a few people threw up quick shots at a song but I didn’t get anything that resembled a viable song nor did I get an offers for a “collaborator” to help me.  So there the idea died.  Or so I thought.

Flash forward to present day.  My father’s 90th birthday is fast approaching and with more “reddit wisdom” I thought, “why not try again”.  This time I researched music-based subreddits and decided to post a plea for help writing a song on /r/songwriters.  
You will see that the post (link in a second below) got literally 3 upvotes and that was all this little “DIY” project needed to get off the ground.  /u/elbow_or_gtfo showed up and threw his hat in the ring!

Now I had imagined that it would be a similar process to what I had done with my son all those years ago – I would hand my lyrics to /u/elbow_or_gtfo and he would unleash his artistic ability and drop out some amazing song that I would be able to give to my Dad.  But this adventure became much more involved – so much more personal, exciting, scary, and – eventually – satisfying.

Read through that post thread here and you’ll see what I mean: https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriters/comments/a8el47/where_can_i_go_to_find_someone_to_record_a_song/
So I’m a guy that knows exactly nothing about music and yet I’ve somehow written and sung a song about my Dad’s life?  By far the scariest thing I have ever done.  And yet one of the most fulfilling.

As the scale of this adventure expanded so did the ideas and work.  My oldest son agreed to record the guitar track for the song.  I reached out to all of my siblings and nieces and nephews to have them sing the closing chorus.  And we decided to create a video to go along with the song that would use old photographs – the few we had from my father’s youth – along with many, many pictures of my siblings and the 12 grandchildren – to tell the story of my Dad’s life along with the music.

And now we are closing in on the end of the adventure.  I’ve uploaded the completed music video to Youtube.  My Dad’s birthday is this Friday so we only have a day or two to wrap things up.

Do you want to help me finish this project?  If so could you please go to the video link below and leave a comment in the Youtube comments section wishing my Dad a “Happy 90th Birthday!” and maybe mention where you are from.  I am hopeful we can get 100 birthday wishes for him from all over the world.
In closing, I want to say this was the scariest thing I have ever done in life.  I can’t think of anything more petrifying than taking your personal thoughts and words, helping to turn them into a song, and then actually SINGING the damn thing for everyone and their brother to hear and make fun of.

But you know what?  Never let your fear of failure – your fear of the unknown – stop you from trying something new.

And just as importantly, hopefully those of you that are currently facing life’s challenges will hear in my Father’s story some truths that can help you work through your current situation as well.  Peace!

93,I’ve literally spent most of my life very lonely because I was forced to grow up early so I didn’t really find much interest in the things of most other kids. Most people don’t understand me and they end up leaving me cause they think I’m crazy. But I’ve always had these big dreams and I’ve also always had this mentality that no matter what happens I’m willing to die to make my dreams and goals happen. But part of my dream is to not have to make it alone. The thing is I’m looking for a real brotherhood or companionship ( guys and girls) made up of people who have the same mentality ( people who want to keep surpassing their limits every day and not settle with an average life). But there’s no one like that here in my hometown and I’m getting very tired of this loneliness. ,06Mar2019,5
94," 

R. Kelly, Michael Jackson, and the YouTube adpocalypse pt 2 have all been in the news lately. The details of these stories have gotten me thinking a lot about the [\#metoo](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/metoo?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG) movement.

I view the movement as society dealing with the side effects of the sexual revolution, but also the nature of human sexuality itself. We're in the middle of figuring out how all of this is supposed to work. How do we determine when accusations are actionable? How do we balance protecting victims of exploitation, and protecting others from scornful false allegations?

The sexual revolution freed us to an extent from the prudish constraints imposed by religious culture. I can't help but wonder why those constraints were imposed to begin with. I imagine some prehistoric era where grotesque depravity was rampant, that inspired the impulse for that kind of sexual repression. I think there is a lesson to be learned there, and a balance that needs to be found.

Some background: I am a full time grad student and an intern part time and both legally and financially independent so my life is chaos. My grandmother raised me and she is currently in a retirement community completely alone and depressed. I call her almost every single day and just let her talk without ever getting a word in. She just goes on and on and I half listen and half do other things because she will talk for an hour straight at least but I try very hard to call every day right when I get out of my classes or work because I know she is lonely and depressed and I love her. The fact is, is she is also very depressing to listen to. Another example is my boyfriend and I just got a puppy and he is 12 weeks now and I love him to death  and take very good care of him and always try to make sure he gets out his energy and gets lots of attention. 

On days like today, however I had an especially long and stressful day and I am so tired physically and mentally. I just want to lay in bed and not speak to anyone or do anything. I don’t want to call my grandma and listen to her for an hour and I don’t want to play with my puppy. I can’t even relax though because I know my Grammy is probably sitting around all alone and sad and lonely and disappointed I haven’t called and my puppy is just sitting around looking at me like “why won’t you play with me?” It sounds trivial I feel like, but it’s really distressing because at this point I lose either way. I either have to sit here and feel like a terrible person and be anxious about not doing enough or I have to exert the energy into listening to my depressing grandma for an hour and force myself to engage in conversation with her and then also wear myself out playing with this puppy? What should I do? Am I being selfish? I feel like some people say I am and these are my responsibilities and everyone is tired but we all have to take care of our shit and then some people say I shouldn’t feel bad for giving myself the time I need to relax and take care of myself every now and then. Either way I just can’t seem to relax. ",06Mar2019,4

99,"I've always been very introverted and had zero interest in social media. I made an Instagram to try to reconnect with old friends a few months ago. I don't think I understand and maybe I am being creepy? I always scroll through my feed and like everyone's photos because I thought that was the nice thing to do, and then a coworker made a comment about how frequently I like their photos as though it was a bad thing. It made me feel like a creep, is there some rule about not liking things too much or liking them too soon or too late after they have been posted? 

I also want to crawl in a hole and die, because I just found out that people can see if you watched their story. And I've always watched everyone's story thinking it wasn't a big deal. My friend was like ""oh crap I didn't mean to open that, now he's going to get the wrong idea"" and I was so lost, I didn't know he could see she open it, and what idea would he get? She also said I hate having to wait through boring stories so that I don't offend people. So people can see if you watch their story and how much of it? Are you not supposed to watch stories if you're not close with the person? And is it rude to not watch the entirety of the story? 

Also, why is text messaging not ok anymore? People always ask why I don't have a snapchat, like its the only way to communicate now. People who have my phone number will often message me on instagram instead and I'm not sure why, is texting just out? I hate that they can see when I viewed the message and how long I'm typing. I feel so pressured to respond right away and it kinda stresses me out, why do people prefer this?

Last question is it weird to start a casual conversation with someone on instagram? I have a friend that I caught up with a bit, we talked about meeting up for a drink, and exchanged a few brief messages here and there. Sometimes I just want to talk to someone but people makes jokes about ""sliding into the DM's""? My friend is of the opposite sex and significantly better looking/more successful than me, and I just legitimately want to talk because I think they're fun to talk to. Now I'm scared if I try to start conversation too much, I'll be seen as a creep. 

I'm so lost, I was really enjoying seeing what people were up to and now I just feel like a outcast who doesn't understand all these weird rules. I'm worried I'm creeping people out or making them think I'm coming on to them(?). 

Please for the love of god explain how these things work to me, because I felt like I was rekindling old friendships, now I feel like I'm ruining them with stalker vibes.

TL;DR: Tell me how to not be weird on Instagram",06Mar2019,3
100,"I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for many years. I'm so tired and so disgusted with myself. 


I've been jumping from job to job for the past year and every one of them depressed the fuck out of me. Im currently working at Panera bread and have already called out 2 times and just got the job less then a month ago. 




I hate myself. I'm in a relationship with this incredible guy. He loves me so much. But I'm so selfish and live in my head so much that I don't show the love I have for him the way he does for me. He deserves that kind of love and I want to be better for him. But sometimes my hatred for me is more powerful then the love I have for him.



I don't have any skill sets. I'm so dumb. I have really bad brain fog. 




I just hope things get better soon. ",06Mar2019,1
