0,"I just started at a new job that moved me across the country. The program that I got into is for new graduates and there is over 20+ people in it. The first day, I found out that nearly all of the candidates in the program knew each other from past internships or fraterinties and it was very clear by the end of the first week that everyone had their own cliques. I've tried desperately to try and get along with others, but I have had a lot of trouble making friends. I grew up with the same friends since middle school, and it's been a LONG time since I've had to try and make friends. It doesn't help that I started college late and I am a good 4 to 5 years older than my co-workers.

Here is what I've tried:
1.went to a party with them (didn't go well, everyone just had their own groups and anytime I tried to join the conversation they just ignored me).

2.Try to grab lunch with them, but I really dont know how to carry a conversation, but I can tell that they really aren't interested when I speak. They quickly start forming their own conversations.

3.I try to shoot the shit with them while we are on break, but they will quickly end our conversation and go talk to others.

4.Tried to find others with the same hobbies(music), I thought I found someone who liked to make the same music as me, but he has avoided talking to me since, or gives me one word answers and then walks away. 

5.Tried to make plans outside of work with them, they tell me ""yes"" to my face, and then cancel over text. (Happened multiple times now).


I really dont know what to do. At my last job, I was well liked by my coworkers, and I had great friends outside of work, but everyday I've worked at my new company, I just become less confident in my social skills. I can feel this awkward energy around me that I haven't felt since I was in high school. 

I feel like my confidence is going down and I'm starting to get really depressed because I can't  make friends.",07Aug2019,1
2,"and I don't know how to feel about it. I went in to the regular doctor because I felt a lump and a month later saw a specialist (today) and they confirmed there is a lump but it's most likely a fibroadenoma. I want to cry and feel sad about it but something about that seems kind of, idk, fake since I know it's most likely something benign. They're checking again in 6 months. I just don't quite know how to feel right now but writing it out made me feel better.",07Aug2019,1
4,"So this year I graduated highschool, Didn't do that bad graduated with a 4.0. I just didn't even try at all cause I didn't have the motivation to do so. I'm so antisocial I don't get certain things, don't have a job and it doesn't help that I don't feel any motivation or have very little of. I just enrolled myself into college, I don't really want to go, but my parents and everyone else think I'll do great in college. I have to do a FAFSA but I think it's too late for that, so I don't know what to do. I can't even get my life together, I get really bad anxiety when driving till the point I had to renew my temps. Now I'm going to owe money to a college. You want to know what I was going for Art. You don't even need to go to college for art you can learn at home. I just hate myself so much , I'm just crying and feeling sorry for myself. I just can't handle feeling like this all most every day. I can't even tell my mother that I don't want to go cause I already told her, she told me she know what's best. I just feel stupid cause everyone looks at me like I'm. I'm not good at speaking since I don't do it that much. It doesn't help when the financial lady at the college tell you ""Of course you wouldn't know that."" Maybe she didn't mean it like that, but I had that feeling that it did. I just distract myself all the time with games, books and videos. So I think or feel. My feelings just explode making me cry or angry at something like me dropping something or doing a small mistake. I don't know what's wrong with me. Hitting myself over a small mistake I can't help it. It makes me feel a bit better. I have no reason to feel like this. I'm just frustrated. My life is good. I never had any issues in my life to make me like this. It's very hard to tell someone my feelings since I was always told I'm feeling sorry for myself. Well if that was the case I would have stopped a long time ago cause it hurts so bad sometimes. I don't know what to do.",07Aug2019,3

7,It’s story of my life . I feel really sad and disappointed. I have tried many interviews but no one gives me a chance and I can’t get a job. I am 26 and never had a proper job because I was taking care of my disabled father since I was 19 and he passed away recently. So now I have to get a proper job and it’s been really hard. I’ve always been extremely shy and anxious person and fail every interview. It’s discouraging. Feels like everything bad happens to me.,07Aug2019,5
8,I was cooking bacon on a flat pan and it has a black handle which I'm not sure if its Teflon or a high thermal plastic? The bacon grease slid off the extremely thin walls and caught on fire and was too intense to grab the pan. The handle seemed to get burnt and the entire place smells like burnt fumes which may be plastic? How dangerous are the fumes from this? I figured since it's on a pan it should've been good enough to handle high temp but the fact it went to burnt plastic worries me. Not sure how hot the flames were and if it went above to create harmful vapors...,07Aug2019,1
9,"Pretext: I'm not really looking for sympathy, I just need to rant.

I woke up at around 8:30 A.M. to my mother standing over me. She was crying. I asked what was wrong, and she said that our 15-year-old dog had died. I attended his burial, of course.

I was not emotional... at all... during the burial. But, as of 7:30 P.M. this evening, I became incredibly sloshered/drunk. My dog's death really hit me. At around 9:00, I asked my dad what had happened with our dog. Here is (essentially) how our conversation went:

Dad: Do you really want to know what happened?

Me: Yes.

Dad: I ran. It was an accident; I had to go to the hardware store and when I came home, I backed up to the garage. He must have thought that he was going to go for a ride so he came up to the truck, I didn't see him so I backed over him. I feel ***incredibly*** guilty.







I just... I don't know how to feel. I'm so tired. I miss him.",07Aug2019,10
10,"I think the more the internet fetishizes the gun control debate the more we fear another mass shooting will occur.  I know every day there is a risk of dying -- from anything.  But I don't fear it.  I know that in this current time period all of us are living the safest lives in human history.  That being said, statistics are numbers.  While they don't care about feelings, I think our feelings can certainly dictate how we respond to others' actions.  

It is ludicrous to me that you've got politicians acting like children trying to fix a problem out of emotional reaction instead of calmly and objectively working to make our country better.  I think their proposals are driven purely by the fear of death and I think they should instead be coming from the perspective of hope, of caring, of self-care.  But no, blame the guns and not our own insecurities.  Don't blame our culture of extroversion that ostricizes people who think differently. Don't blame it on the fact that diagnoses of clinical depression are on the rise. Don't blame it on the ""hush hush"" nature of mental illness.  Sweep it under the rug.  I don't want to hear about your problems.  But I'll go and slam-post the NRA all day long because I don't really want to look introspectively.  I don't really want to talk about death.  I want to blame it on only what is tangible to make myself feel better.  Until it happens again.  And you post the same gun-control rhetoric. Then it happens again.  And then you post again.  Then it happens again.  On, and on, and on.  

You may be right that gun access plays a role in mass shootings.  You may be right that the US has a high homicide rate compared to most other developed countries (I take back my incorrect post from earlier). But you are wrong to take these statistics to further an agenda that is rooted in the fear of death.  You are wrong to make yourself feel good by saying the right words to the right people.  I've done this too, I'm not perfect. But we're not supposed to gratify ourselves in the face of terrorism.  This isn't about you being right.  This should be about communities coming together, collaborating and seeking a logical, positive and sustainable solution that benefits everyone, from those who have their life in order to those who are at their mental breaking point.  These shooters, they have done wrong. But they are/were still people.  They deserve to be understood.  But we label them as monsters and as psychopaths.  Do you know that for a fact? Have you talked to him/her? Have you walked their life path?  Do you know what it feels like to be autistic, to be clinically depressed or bipolar? Would you want to? I think these shooters are actually human, complete with hopes, dreams, aspirations, emotions, likes, and dislikes.  I think that they have/had struggles in their journey through life just as you and I will/did.  And I think they get angry at their situation, just as you or I might. But the synonymity stops when the anger becomes to much to handle.  Most are able to channel it out in healthy ways.  But some need a little help to get better.  And that is perfectly OK.  Don't ever ignore someone when they say they're hurting inside or that they want to die.  Take it as a sign that they need that extra bit of help to get them where they're going.  Would you not want the same thing for yourself?  

In conclusion, don't fear death. Don't fear the unknown. Don't fear your neighbor.  Don't take what you see unfolding on a screen as absolute truth.  Don't see a shooters as inhuman. 
 Instead, go outside.  Talk and learn and understand what's really going on around you.  Look for simple ways to spread kindness. If you have a friend struggling mentally, shoot them a text and let them know you are willing to listen and to give advice.  Christ said ""...love your neighbor as yourself"".  We need more of this.",07Aug2019,7

Imagine waking up at 45 in a dead end mid 50k salary job. Trapped in a passionless marriage with a wife that doesn't love you, is probably cheating, and you have to beg her for sex. You have two ungrateful teenagers who also don't love you. Your home is an unremarkable house in the suburbs. 

Your only comforts are watching marginal gains on your 401k, and drinking Bud Light at a D-Grade, Land Locked Applebees talking about Fantasy Football with ""the guys"" who are really just your coworkers.

12,"Please read fully before labeling me as transphobic. I still love them. My friend (ex girlfriend) recently came out as gender noncomforming. I have been, and will continue to be, completely and 100% supportive. They have enough to deal with going through a gender transition in the first place. However, they changed a lot very quickly when they came out, to the point where I am still trying to find the human that I love under all the gender complications. They seem to have made their gender identity into their entire identity. I am often afraid to talk to them or take them places, because so many things in today’s culture set them off. We can’t go swimming on hikes (something we used to love) because they are conscious about their body. I accidentally took them to a bath and body works, which was upsetting to them because of the men’s collection. I realize that I should have asked what they were comfortable with before we went. I want to love and support them. They are the same wonderful, incredible human I loved when we dated. At the moment though, I struggle to believe that because it is hard to find. Every conversation is about how things aren’t inclusive enough. I can’t imagine what they are going through, or how it is to feel alienated constantly. But I fee like they are shutting me out and we can’t have normal conversations anymore, and it’s almost a sense of grief. As much as I tell myself I they are the same person; they are bound to change in this process, and I am trying to come to terms with the fact that I miss who they were before while also trying to get to know and love the person they are now. Has anyone else gone through this? I have really only heard about “accepting and supporting,” and I agree that that’s the priority, but a year later, I still don’t feel the same closeness I had with them before.",07Aug2019,52
13,"So last night I went on a first date with this girl I’ve been talking to for a few weeks (i’m 20, she’s 18)we had known each other awhile but the relationship didn’t get romantic until recently. we had plans for dinner and a movie and all day she was texting me wanting to hook up, because she had her house all to herself. Obviously I was down. So we meet up and decide to take one car to go eat (she insisted on driving, so I left mine at the mall) everything is cool and going decently for an hour, she’s on her phone a lot and dry which was annoying but we shared some laughs, until all of a sudden her sister calls. Her 8 year old brother got bit by a fucking dog and needs to go to the emergency room. Her sister is 15 and can’t drive, and they didnt want to call 911 because Tyler was scared. So we race like a bat out of hell to her house and find her brother crying like hell, I try to help but he’s really stand-offish with me (makes sense, I feel for the kid) and after we finally get him in the car which takes 20 minutes she tells me her grandparents are meeting them at the hospital and she needs to drop me off ASAP because she doesn’t want to get in trouble for being on a date when her brother got hurt, which sortof made sense at the time. the mall is in the other direction entirely, so she drops me off at a target on the way like 3 minutes from her place. so I’m like okay. she drops me off at a fucking target and says she still wants to hook up later, so she’ll come get me in like a few hours. it’s a big shopping center so I’m like okay, I’ll waste time until she comes back. well about an hour later, she texts me and literally says “I’m into black guys, tried to like u but we didn’t vibe sorry bye” and I’m out here like

what the fuck!!!

I called her and basically said it’s some bullshit she didn’t tell me this beforehand but you know I respect her decision and whatever bye. my phone is on 15% and I decide to get an uber, but before I can get a car my phone dies with no explanation. so I decide to ask someone in Target to use their phone, I call my friend and have him come scoop me. it was supposed to take him 15 mins but it ended up being over an hour because he had something come up. meanwhile my phone is still dead and my stubborn ass refuses to buy a $15 target charger when I already have so many. In theory I could’ve called a taxi but at the time so much had already happened I didn’t really think it through. I’m just glad I didn’t waste money on condoms. it’s rough being a college student out here. 

moral of the story, never let your date give you a ride.",07Aug2019,57
14,"A little background: 

As a college student, I spend the summers working a maintenance job for a neighboring city so that I can get some extra cash for fun/savings/tuition etc. It’s a perfect summer job; starts early but you’re done by 3:30 and the pay is great for the small amount of work we actually do (if you’ve ever worked on a city work crew you probably know what I’m talking about lol.) 

Anyway, this job has two groups of employees; seasonals and full-timers. Full-timers work there year-round and have a salary; seasonal workers are 95% college kids like myself who just work when they’re not in school and earn hourly. However, one seasonal worker who we’ll call “Sam” is not in college, he’s 24 and graduated from a rather decent university a couple years prior. Sam was the first guy I worked with; he showed me the ropes and was helpful, nice, easy to work with, and clearly had a passion for working outdoors much like myself. It took a couple days, but I eventually started to really enjoy working with him and we clicked pretty well. 

After a while, I started to notice things about him that began digging at me. 

He came into work every morning clearly struggling and unhappy. Not super weird, right? Everyone struggles in the morning. But I’ve been through more than my fair share of rough times and can tell when someone isn’t just having a rough day. There was an emptiness, a lack of life and movement in his eyes and facial expressions that made me think he was pushing through something bigger than just a bump in the road. 

He ate the same exact sandwich for work everyday; three slices of bologna with one slice of cheese on white bread. Nothing else. Ever. He has eaten that and only that for lunch everyday. When I asked him why he didn’t change it up or bring more food sometimes he said “I can’t afford anything else right now.” I shut my mouth right then and there. My ignorance had shined, I forgot there were people out there who didn’t have leftovers from there moms home-made cooking the night prior to eat for lunch everyday, and I felt like an asshole. 

He would make comments about how he couldn’t wait to go home and just drink his whiskey. This was looked over by everyone else, but I’ve dealt with alcoholics and been one myself and it’s clear when someone is joking around and when they are trying to rationalize with themselves with humor to downplay a problem. Sam was clearly struggling with alcoholism, drinking was the one topic he would always love to talk about and had no shame in joking about how he goes through a bottle a night. This led to our other co-workers not realizing the situation was more serious and they began joking about it too, which I’m sure deep down didn’t feel good for Sam. 

He gets screwed at work. He gets paired up with the same obnoxious and difficult person everyday and is sent to the same parks everyday to do the same exact job everyday. Again, not necessarily an anomaly in a work environment, but understand that me and every single other employee there has been moved around between jobs, partners, and locations almost weekly, but not Sam. This changing-up helps tremendously with morale and overall effort and interest level of employees, it’s nice going to work everyday and wondering what you might do that day (at least for me). Doing the same exact thing with that same co-worker who grinds your gears in ways you never thought possible EVERY SINGLE DAY will get to you real quick and make work a nightmare if it wasn’t already. 

Sam also cracks jokes about him having depression, much like he does with his drinking problem. Usually, more often than not, when someone consistently jokes about themselves being depressed or otherwise in distress, it’s a cry for help. I knew that, and after everything else I just decided to just be straight up with Sam one day and asked him if he was doing ok. It was bold of me and, looking back, kind of inappropriate due to us being in the middle of a job and hardly knowing each other yet. Because we were busy he just looked at me quickly and said “yeah, i’m good” then got back to work. 

About three hours later, we were in our truck heading back to the shop for the end of the day and Sam goes “how did ya know?” I asked him what he meant just to make sure, and he reassured me that we were both talking about his situation. I explained to him how I do a lot of watching and listening and not a lot of talking and doing, I pick up on things like that and don’t forget them, and it was clear to me that he was struggling. 

This post is getting long, so I’m gonna keep the rest as short as possible. 

Sam went on to tell me about his worries and why he was struggling to be happy. He busted his ass through college in hopes of becoming a park ranger only to find out that the job market for park rangers is very small. He was given terrible career and life advice from his counselors at University and said he was told to “use his race to get a job, because everyone wants minorities now a days” (he’s a black man). After uni, he was left with a lot of debt and no job. Eventually he stumbled upon our current employer and submitted an application for the summer because it was better than no job at all. Told me he was excited for it even though the pay was hardly enough for him to get by, but was disappointed when he got a month in and realized he had landed himself in what was essentially an outdoor janitor gig. He lives with his girlfriend whom has been with him for the past six years, it gave me a little peace knowing he had someone to go home to at the end of the day, someone to love him and keep him company. That can make everything worth it when it seems like it’s not, ya know?

I’m still not sure why I decided to write this, or why Sam has had such a profound effect on my empathy for others. I guess I’ve never really taken the time to understand other people’s situations, much less feel sympathy for them. Sam was so damn nice and friendly; always tried to keep a smile on his face and a pep in his step. He works hard, stays true, and puts others before himself despite waking up every morning with very little to look forward to. He sacrifices and holds passion. No one helps him but himself. And he truly embodies what it is to be a good person. 

Above all, Sam made me thankful for what I had and humbled me into realizing that everyone is struggling with something on top of all the other bullshit that is attached to life. Waking up at 5:30 a.m. for work all summer was dreadful to me at first; but I have two parents, a house, cooked meals, and a care-free schedule to go home to. My money is going to be used for fun, not bills. My mom still refuses to not do my laundry for me (love you to death mom, but you do too much hahah.) I don’t have to worry about finding another job once the season is over. I don’t have an unrealistic amount of debt to pay off. You get the idea. It could be a lot worse. 

Sam is still around, and I still see him nearly everyday. My co workers and I always make an effort to include him in our conversations at lunch and invited him to sit at our table as well. I always greet him at the beginning of the day and walk out to his car and talk with him at the end too. Just little things like that, little meaningful actions throughout the day, has improved his mood and attitude greatly. And it’s awesome to see.

I’ve been sitting here for nearly 20 minutes trying to type up a closing paragraph on why I wrote this, and I still don’t know. Sam was just very kind to me, he made arriving at my new job a lot more easy-going than it could have been and because of that, he stood out to me. I tried to repay his kindness with mine, and in the end we did each other a lot of good. Now I’m more humble and appreciative of my life, Sam is more at peace with his, and we got a friendship out of it too. So be kind and look out for each other, this world seriously needs it.",07Aug2019,0
15,"Only 4 people that I’m closest with in my life know about what happened to me. I have never posted anything on reddit and it’s honestly scares me to no end to share my story, but I really need to so that I can possibly  get help/advice on how to get through this. I haven’t reported any of the assaults because it’s honestly my word against theirs and all I want is for the painful flashbacks to go away. 

It all started after I turned 21. Get ready for a long read because there are three incidents that had occurred where I was sexually assaulted under the influence. The first two happened in the same week in different states (absolutely baffles me and makes me hate myself to have allowed myself to get into such situations). I’ll post the story in the comments..

#1 - Stranger I Met at a Bar (4/9/19)
I was out with a friend at a college bar out of state. We were drinking pretty heavily (not our smartest move) we met a group of 4 nice boys and they talked to us until closing. They asked us to go back to their place, my friend begged me to go with and I thought that she shouldn’t go to a strangers place alone (my biggest regret). They got an Uber, I asked how far away they lived, they told me it was 10 minutes but really it was more like 20. We got to their place, hangout, and talk. I don’t remember much but my friend and I separated (she went to bed with one of the guys) I had gone downstairs on the couch and one of the guys had followed me. I know I fell asleep right away but I woke up in the middle of the night to something touching me. I was laying next to the guy (unconscious) his hand was up my dress rubbing my ass. I froze and tried to figure out what was happening (I was still pretty drunk). I fell back asleep only to be awoken again but this time to him attempt to put his hand down my tights. I immediately knew what was going on and pushed his hand away. I texted me friend to leave and we took an Uber back to our hotel. Never confronted the guy because I didn’t know how to react. I still responsible for getting myself in such a dangerous situation. 

#2 - My Blind Date (4/12/19)
I had visited a friend of mine at her college who had set me up with one of her guy friends. I thought he was cute so I agreed. I went bar hopping with her, my date, and a huge group of friends. The whole night he kept pushing drinks on me, excessively complimenting me (and I mean excessively), constantly called me “his”. After 9+ drinks we went to our last bar where he attempted to kiss me (he went tongue first which freaked me out) I told him, “No, not right now”. Everything is a bit blurry after that, but i do remember going back to his apartment for more drinks. I refused more  because I didn’t want to get sick. We ended up watching a movie on his bed which I ended up falling asleep, so he tried to kiss me again. I pushed his face away. I fell asleep and slept through the entire night. But I was awoken in the morning to yet again a hand caressing my ass and hips. He pushed his groin up against me, I just froze, I was still drunk, and couldn’t belief this was happening to me again. I just laid there like a dead body. This lasted for at least an hour or so until he unbuttoned/unzipped my jeans. I immediately grabbed his hand, pushed it away, then got up and left his place. I called my friend to tell her to let me into her place but I never told her what happened. I only told her that I didn’t want to see him again. I guess I didn’t say anything because felt embarrassed that I had been so careless and stupid. I never confronted him about it and I just blocked him on everything. 

After all of this happened I isolated myself from friends for weeks and quit drinking for a few months until just a few days ago. Which leads into my last and final story. 

#3 - A Once Trusted Friend (8/4/19) 
This is probably the worst of the whole lot. I went out drinking with one of my best friends and a guy friend of a few years. It was the first night I had drank since the last incident. I was celebrating finishing my summer classes. It was a fun night until we all got back to his house. I was really drunk so I laid on his downstairs couch. But him and my friend kept trying to wake me up &amp; telling me to come upstairs to sleep on the bed with them. I agreed, went upstairs, and passed out (We all shared the same bed). Then randomly I felt my bra unclasp and a hand running to the side of my chest. He was right up against me groping my boobs, grabbing my ass, rubbing my back, etc. This lasted for awhile but eventually I realized the situation I was in and smacked his hand away. He then groped me again and so I smacked his hand away for a second time which finally made him stop. I just laid there in disbelief. He later woke up claiming he didn’t remember anything and that he “blacked out” and also I want add that him and my friend had drunken sex next to me. He also later admitted to me and my friend that he is a “Nymphomaniac” (I think he meant satyromaniac) but he said it in a jokingly kind of sick way. I confronted him yesterday and he took responsibility. But I didn’t get any satisfaction from it I still feel the same, I still feel so numb.

I’ve isolated myself from everyone in my life I need help. I feel so numb and this all so overwhelming, I just don’t understand how I keep attracting these men. I never gave them consent, I couldn’t have been able to. I think I’ll take a permanent break from booze. These experiences just make me want to avoid guys and having any sexual relationship with them as well. I can’t help but hate myself putting my trust in bad hands. I’m sorry this so long but I really appreciate this forum letting me vent. I thank anyone who took the time out their day to read my experience. Please, if anyone could give me ways how to cope with this or any other advice that could be useful.",07Aug2019,1
16,"In the lid it has a ""breather hole"" so that the liquid inside flows freely, but when I tip it up to drink from it... the tip of my nose covers the hole.... hampering the flow of liquid.

17,"On a small street with a vacant lot, a creek, a couple of basketball goals, and around 7 boys my age at any given time, the world was our oyster. We had laser tag, nerf football games, knockout, killer be killed, slaughterball, skateboards, street hockey, neverending, random found playboys, firecrackers, Nintendo...you name it. My childhood was great, I had tons of friends by default, and we got along well. 
   
Things are not that way, now. Being a father means I have not had time for friends for so many years that I don't even know how to be a friend, anymore. Social media came in and weirded it all up, too...took away what we had to talk about because we already saw the pictures, already read the opinions, judged and envied from afar. Hell, video games are even better at a distance, so coming over to sit next to your friend on the couch makes less sense than it did 15 years ago. 
   
The people at work become your default friends. That's tainted, whether it be by office politics, obligatory professionalism, or just the hum drum of the workday: work friends don't have the same feel as your free association friends.

This is all going to sound like I’m extremely jealous of this person, however I know I’m not. I’m simply frustrated with my situation and honestly his as well and how unfair it all seems. I don’t have any resentment towards him, again I just wanted to vent. 

I’m usually pretty good at limiting my self pity, but I don’t think anything is wrong with admitting to myself that this situation sucks.

I don’t consider myself to be super intelligent, but I put the effort in to getting pretty good grades. My friend never put any effort into school but would get upset whenever me or my other friends would express our excitement when we got a good grade back (by no means was this in a condescending way. I personally hate that and wouldn’t want to make him feel that way, as I’ve had to deal with that kind of behaviour myself). He’s never had a job, and is fairly outgoing so social anxiety (which I’ve unfortunately had to deal with most of my life) isn’t a problem for him, so I see no reason as to why none of these things have happened:
1. Get a job
2.  Have parents force/heavily encourage him to get a job like my parents have 
3. Go to work at his parents store (an incredible opportunity!!). 
I don’t even think he has a hobby. The first job I had made me feel utterly terrible about myself due to my social anxiety, and I feel like he’s wasting the great position he’s in. We haven’t known each other for too too long but he’s starting to annoy me with even the slightest complaint about his life. His parents aren’t divorced and has a good home life, whereas my parents are divorced and are in a pretty crappy situation. He missed application deadlines for his top colleges because he didn’t “feel like” applying or setting up interviews. And now he’s going on not one, but TWO trips - a graduation gift - with no cost to him. While I’m working to save up for school, applying for loans and scholarships, he’s being rewarded with some fun trips for having 0 drive or motivation to do anything. 

Sometimes I really wish I could tell him all this but I think I’d just make him feel bad about himself, which I don’t wanna do. I just think he’s wasting his pretty decent position in life due to lack of motivation. He definitely could’ve achieved his goals for school because he’s a smart kid, but he didn’t put much effort into it and no one has said anything to him about it. I know it would suck for him to have this realization later on. 

I just want to say I’m incredibly grateful for my parents pushing me to do things that I didn’t want to do, because I’d probably be in the same position he’s in right now without them. I know I’m pretty lucky in my position but I can’t say that my life is 100% sunshine and rainbows.

I stopped coloring and basically feel like I'm not good enough to even color. Everyone can do shading and all sorts of cool stuff and basically be gods at coloring. While I'm just doing simple colors.

24,"I'm trying to pay off my bills and my current job is helping me do that but we've been slowing down, so much so that I was given an unpaid week off work. I had a couple days to find some work, I even considered joining Uber. I got lucky and realized I still had my old boss's phone number even though I had a new phone since I left a little under 2 years ago. I didnt think it carried over. Luckily it did and I messaged him, total shot in the dark, does he have need of an extra set of hands around the shop and as my luck would have it, he messaged me back and this week I have work and he's given me a better rate than I had when I left there! I of course expressed my gratitude and even offered to help out a couple hours some days after I finish my main job and he took me up on that offer so now I have an additional source of income, minor as it may be based on hours but I have my main job and I should be getting a raise there soon, then I have my new side job for additional income! I'll be able to pay off my bills faster and faster!

27,"Hello, 17F here. I know that social media has a plethora of benefits for small &amp; large businesses, spreading positivity, creating communities, sharing news, entertainment, and so much more. However, I will forever fail to comprehend WHY millions of individuals choose to post selfies, pictures of themselves doing random things, vacationing, etcetera. Obviously I know that many people are merely seeking validation, whether they care to admit it or not, but I can’t help but think there must be something more, some underlying purpose to all of this. When I scroll through the profiles of my peers or strangers, I cannot see an actual purpose behind sharing the photos that most people do. Logically, I’d conclude that every single person out there is genuinely starved for validation through comments and likes or simply wants to show off, but I’m inclined to believe that humanity is better than that and that these photos have some deeper meaning that I’m missing. 

For example, when I take a ‘cute’ picture with a friend of mine. I first think, “maybe I’ll post this,” but I always end up asking myself “why would you? For who? For what reason?” And I can never find a valid answer. Please share your opinions because I am truly at a loss here. Or am I completely right?...",07Aug2019,12

30,"Like I'm constantly paranoid that all my friends don't like me/talk about me behind my back, and then also I am extremely clingy because I feel like I need to be talking to whichever friend I'm focused on in order to keep me in their head so they still like me. 

Then whenever I feel like one of them doesn't like me, I get extremely depressed and suicidal and then I have lasting suicidal thoughts for about a week, thinking I should die and wanting to die etc. Or at least want to get into hard drugs to forget the pain (I haven't but the want is there). And that happens every single time I feel like somebody who I really like doesn't like me. 

What doesn't help is that whenever I meet somebody new, I basically fall in love and want to be their friend forever. My emotions toward them go from 0-100% and I genuinely cannot help that. I feel like we've been friends for years and are destined to be friends forever, which is what makes the paranoia worse whenever I feel like they dislike me in any way. 

All of this causes me to constantly see if my friends are online, and correlate that between other friends that are online to see if they're excluding me from anything. I constantly stalk what their doing and if I see one of them not posting on social media/going into offline mode I'll just assume that they're trying to avoid me and the entire cycle of suicidal behaviour continues. I was technically diagnosed with BPD but I don't know if I really have that.

Overall this is just driving me to isolation which is just in turn making things worse, I don't know what to do and my moods cycle like crazy. Any help would be appreciated though.",07Aug2019,5
31,"I don't know where else to put this, my mind is just spinning and I don't have anybody to talk to about it.

The title isn't entirely accurate, I guess I should say I just found out mold is harmful. Which sounds ridiculous, who doesn't know that, right? Well it was just one of those things I always grew up with and never thought anything of. Now I just learned, from a Dr.Phil episode of all places, that mold can effect your mental health. Specifically, causing delusions and paranoia. Those are two things I've suffered GREATLY with for years. I've never been able to see a therapist because my family doesn't believe in mental health but I've struggled with severe mental issues since I was very young. Lots of paranoia, delusions, intrusive thoughts...I could go on, but the point here is I'm just shocked. In this episode, there concerned by like, a 6 inch water spot on the ceiling and barely visible spatterings of mold under the carpet.

Folks.

My house is fucking FULL of mold. I don't know what type but to give you an idea, there been a four foot by four foot gaping hoke that's nothing but mold in our bathroom ceiling for 10+ years. The shower is moldy. Our porch is rotting off the house and smells so bad of mold it will make you gag, you can see it from the outside. Our basement floods and everything down there has been ruined by mold. Things under my bed have had mold. I know it's in the walls too, I often smelled it. I always just thought, as I said, it's just one of those things not that unusual. This tiny bit of knowledge has fucked me up, knowing that by most people's standards this is an awful and dangerous way to live. And it gets a lot worse than that, I mean do you think people who let a four foot black, moldy hole stay in the ceiling for 10+ years have maintained the rest of the house?

I'm afraid to look up the other effects. I've spent my entire life breathing mold and my parent's incessant two packs of cigarettes a day each smoking, I'd hate to think of long term effects.",07Aug2019,6

33,"So I’m M19 and I’ve had a strange couple of years. When I graduated high school 2 years ago, I had also just broken up with my first ever girlfriend (one of the most unhealthy and damaging first experiences possible, but I’m over it) and my main group of friends fell apart. My mental health was garbage and my solution was to wipe my slate clean. I ended every Snapchat streak I had, and told people I no longer wanted to partake. I removed about half of the people on my private Instagram, but kept everyone on my public one. Then once those distractions were out of the way, I took some much needed “me time” where I swore off dating and decided that I needed to prioritize myself.

That brings me to now. I’m 40lbs lighter, fixed my teeth, gained my own sense of style, and got some hobbies(all kinda introverted). I have a lot of confidence, and I’ve really worked through a lot of the things that’ve held me back in the past. But as a result of my personal growth, I lost most of my social connections. I have social media accounts with followers, but I don’t ever post. I have one or two good friends, but am otherwise pretty lonely. I haven’t re entered the dating pool yet. But I’ve decided I want to rejoin the rest of the world. I’m confident, emotionally available and looking to get more out of life. But I don’t know where to start.

My best friend has offered to help me get my social life back on track. He says he’ll teach me how to take Instagram-worthy pictures, and even offered to help me set up dating-app profiles, since my school and work situation makes meeting girls my age very difficult.

Although I’ve grown so much in the past few years , it’s been a long time since I felt like I belonged around other people. I’ve grown tired of the Lone Ranger life I’ve laid out for myself. I’m looking to start a new chapter, but I don’t know how to start.",07Aug2019,1

When i came home from work after a 35min ride and got out of my car, i noticed some miawing. I didn't see any cat when i pulled up in the parking lot so i was rather confused. I walked around the car to try and find the source of the sound. It came from my car, near the engine. What the.., how is this possible? I took a look underneath and suddenly a grey kitten jumped down from the engine compartiment and walked towards me, still miawing. I tried to put it at ease. It worked, the kitten calmed down. I took it inside the house because i couldn't let it run free on a reasonable busy road. I put it in the chicken house and left it alone after i gave it some food and water so he could relax a bit after his adventure. The chickens were not amused!

This is also something they admitted themselves. ‘You don’t listen to us since you were 10. You’re acting like this since you were 10. Why do you talk to me like this, are you my dad?’ This is something my mom and dad told me. And yeah, it’s true that I don’t listen to them since I was 10 bc the things they tell me to do, are not things I can accept. For example: i cannot take the train, i cannot go out with friends, i cannot go to wherever i want, i just can go to the library in my street, i can’t be friends with people who are gay bc they all would have ‘aids’ and they would have a bad influence on me...the reason why i stopped listening to my ‘parents’ is because the things they ask me to do or not are things i can’t accept. They are immigrants and i can sometimes understand why they wouldn’t want me to take the train bc they don’t know the country or any language that is spoken here. But at the same time it’s also bc i’m a girl??? I’m a girl and therefor i should stay at home and accept and do everything my parents say.

She will end up living on the streets.’ I am not dumb and i know that.

My daily routine when I'm not in school and not counting my daily house chores consists mostly of waking up, doing hygienic practices (take a bath, brush my teeth, etc), make breakfast, turn on my desktop, watch videos/play games/read whatever there is to read, make and eat lunch, desktop again, make and eat dinner, desktop until midnight or a few extra hours more and finally sleep. And that's it, that's my freaking life outside of academics. Sounds kinda cozy isn't it? Especially with the fact that I'm always alone until dusk or nighttime considering my parents have work and my sibling is going to high school atm. But truth be told, it gets boring pretty fast and I can't do anything about it because I haven't even fucking graduated yet. I always find myself staring at my desktop wallpaper a lot of times wondering what to do, wasting precious time in the process. Other than that, I always have and feel obligated to pretend to feel good at the end of the day when the rest of my family arrives because I don't want to hear them ranting about how I'm supposedly living ""a good life rn and I should enjoy it while I can"" despite it boring the fuck out of me.

I’ve noticeably gained weight over the past few months because of a sudden obsession with fast food. I’ve also spent way too much money on it.

Starting today I’m going to take my time with everything that I do and try to avoid easily avoidable mistakes. I want to show my coworkers that I can do a good job and that it’s possible to avoid some of the dumb mistakes I’ve been making lately. 

Just a couple small things that I think will make the next few months easier on me until I go back to school.",07Aug2019,7

59,"For about a year and a half now I’ve been attending my local community college. I started with a major in Philosophy (that’s bullshit) and then transitioned into Sociology. Ultimately, I came to a conclusion after being exposed to both of them and I concluded this: the world has problems (duh) but nobody knows how to fix or solve them. So I say fuck it ultimately after a buddy and me got into a conversation about what we always truly wanted to do; he wants aircraft mechanics, and I want forest/park ranger. I’m now on the course to pursue such a career after feeling lost for quite a while. Yet, a moment of deja-vu gave me clarity. This is the correct path for me. I’m doing what I should. I wholeheartedly believe that and I’m happier than I’ve ever been in years.",07Aug2019,1
60,"Today i woke up, looked myself in the mirror, and something felt off.

This drove me into immediate panic, because I am constantly doing ""check ups"" to make sure that the hormone therapy (im a trans guy) im doing is actually what i need to be doing. Every 1-2 weeks i do small check ups, and every 3-4 weeks I re evaluate myself to be sure. 

Today something was off, and I was so nervous, because despite setting up these check ups for myself, i never really knew what to do if something were to go wrong. 

 I don't really have readily available access to my emotions and inner thoughts. I decided to take 10 minutes and just free write. 

And to my relief, it wasn't my gender causing me problems (phew, im still a trans guy), but my identity as a person. I learned im placing too much value in my ""stats"" like how much i can lift, or how strong I am, and less value on what I enjoy doing, like helping people, drawing and longboarding. 

So my solution? Im turning my phone off for today, and I'm going to think about what I like, and what brings me joy, and what I want to be doing. 

Ive never done anything like this before, I feel so good. Trans or not, I reccomend self checkups.",07Aug2019,5

So I train jui jitsu, and I'm pretty serious about it. On this podcast, at the 3:40 mark, Ryan Hall (a fantastic jui jitsu practitioner and MMA fighter) mentions that most people don't truly work hard, because they'd rather look like they've achieved thier goal rather than actually do it.

This struck me because I realized how much time and money I spend in pursuit of appearances, when my goal should really be to BE the best I can rather than appear to others as such.

67,"So basically this story begins way back at the beginning of last year (year 10 for me). I had just changed high schools and didn’t know anyone at my new school. I eventually joined a group of guys as it was an all boys school and I got to know them pretty well as well as their friends from the neighbouring all girls school.
At this all girls school there were a series of girls who was part of our outside of school group with us guys. I ended up dating one of these girls and the break up was quite messy. It took about two months to resolve but we don’t have any beef anymore. 
Then things started to get confusing, at this point I’d already been excluded from a whole lot of things during the two months after our breakup and understandably so. But come new year, I learn that one of my guy “friends” hates me now. All I could understand from that he hated me because “of what I’d done to other people” so nothing actually about him. So this guy who now hates me subsequently organised everything in the group so I get excluded even more. This is from hang outs, group chats, you name it. It took maybe another 4 months for me to work things out with this guy and we’re supposedly all good now. 
So 6 months have elapsed of being completely excluded from this group essentially other than contact by direct message.
I then end up dating another one of the girls (this is probably why u don’t date ur friends) and the break up wasn’t particular messy and I know for certain I don’t have any beef with this girl. However, we’re now in the present (August 2019) and I’m still getting excluded because I apparently have “beef” with someone. I’ve tried to work out who but no ones owning up to it. So I’m kind of just sitting here like.... who the fuck do I have beef with? So I’m kind of confused at what to do. Any advice would be appreciated!

Tl;dr basically being excluded from my group for 8 months now and don’t know why, I also have beef with someone but I can’t work out who fml",07Aug2019,5

But this morning I had a random conversation with a very pretty girl and she called me “cute”. I probly sound crazy for how flustered I feel from something simple but I thought about it and I can’t even recall when was the last time I’ve had any sort of affection from anyone for months.

71,"Today I went shopping to another town because the mall is there. It was a 20 min ride on the bus. I got all the stuff my parents told me to buy, went to the register, there were 2 kids buying ice cream. One of them had a 20, but the total was 20,40 hryvnas (like 80¢ or something). I said: ""oh, you don't have enough? Here ya go buddy"" and handed him 2 hryvnas. The cashier gave me the check and the change. I will keep the check as a reminder of a happy moment.

This past winter I went out for a smoke behind the apartment building I'd lived in. It was Kolyada, caroling day. Mom and her daughter were looking for the phone the daughter lost. She and her friends were running around the house and she seems to have dropped it. There was a thick layer of snow, so after talking to them I went home to get gloves and a broom to scoop the snow. Upon the first swipe of the broom, I found the phone. Got the snow out, yada yada, it's working. They offered me money, but I refused, it feels bad to take it for helping but I had to give in. ""It's nothing compared to buying a new phone"" said the mom and handled me a 200(8 usd as of today). Chills went down my spine and every time it popped into my head, I couldn't contain my joy and an ear-to-ear smile. We continued talking, turns out they were looking for extra English lessons. I offered to teach her daughter, but they never called back. 

These are the few happy moments I can reminisce about. Of course I couldn't stop bragging about it to my family. I could only tell this to my only two friends, so I shared a little bit of my joy with Reddit. There's still hope for a better world with better people, doing tiny things for a bigger cause. As I'm finishing this, I'm almost home. I can feel that my cat is missing me and his back rubs. The other one is a little bitter, he doesn't like being pet.

Just wanna know if you think it's right to cut out friends who are too afraid to tell you what they truly think about something.

Context: I'm someone who values honesty and brings up problems to be truly solved. My ex group of friends are pacifists who are adamant on keeping relationships drama free even when there's clearly a problem. 

I felt exhausted in not being able to take their words at face value. There were many instances of them not being frank, and I finally cut them off after being told that they didn't like something I planned for us to do together days later after agreeing to it initially.

73,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 4+ years. He is 45 and I am 33. We have a one year old daughter together. 

A few months ago, he revealed to me that he has a felony conviction from the 90s for marijuana drug sale and that he married an ex girlfriend some years ago so she could get her citizenship but has no idea where she is now or how to contact her. 

I was of course upset upon learning that he's married and has a felony, but what really made me mad was that he kept it from me for 4 years, and basically lied to me while I was supporting him financially and then had his baby. He hasn't been able to hold down a real job since we've been together. Two jobs went nowhere and when he tried to start his own business, it failed. So through all of that, I was the one paying for all the bills and then some. 

After his revelations, on the advice of my friend and my therapist, I sat my boyfriend down and told him that he needs to get a stable job, contribute to the bills and work on his divorce. I felt I needed to give him a chance to right his wrongs since we had a baby together. But in the 2 months since I told him that, I have not seen him put any effort into these things or make any progress. 

Yesterday, I posted about this in an advice sub and every response was basically ""you're an idiot, dump him, you are terrible at choosing a man."" It really hurt to read those responses over and over again, but deep down I know they're right. I am an idiot. The red flags were there even before he told me about his marriage and conviction. I never should have invested four years with this man. 

So, this morning, I broke up with him and told him I'd give him a reasonable amount of time to move out.

I have no idea what the future holds for me and my baby and that scares me. But I'm a responsible adult and will do what needs to be done. Thankfully, my mom is staying with us for a few months so she can help with childcare while things get figured out. 

I know it was the right thing to do and it was time to do it. I just needed the push.",07Aug2019,10
74,"Earlier this year, I got out of a toxic relationship, though not really by choice. I was living with my now ex, my cat, and our dog. Things had been rocky since we moved in together, but I thought the good times made up for the bad ones. Towards the end we both had our problems: I was seriously questioning my sexuality and gender identity and having issues with my mental health, and he was abusing heroin again and sleeping with other women. 

One night as we were sitting in the living area, he suddenly stood up and started screaming at me to leave. I couldn’t get him to calm down, and he pushed me out of the apartment and locked the door behind him. I stayed at my parents’ that night. I tried to contact him several times so we could work it out, but when he refused, I got the apartment manager to let me back in the apartment so I could get my cat and my stuff. My family came with me, which made him angrier. He screamed at my parents, threw a glass at me, and threatened to fight my brother. He finally locked himself in a closet and we quickly gathered my stuff and got out. 

That night, he called me from a number I didn’t recognize and said someone had kidnapped the dog and wanted me to come over to help him find the dog. My parents stopped me from going there and told me to call the police instead. So I did. I gave the police the address of the apartment and told them everything he had said to me. I also asked to not be contacted again unless they needed me.  I didn’t hear from anyone that night. 

The next day, my ex called from yet another number and told me that no one had kidnapped the dog, he just wanted to see me. He said the police took the dog away after my ex confessed to lying about the dog being kidnapped and when they saw he wasn’t taking care of the dog. My ex screamed at me and said he was going to kill himself. So I hung up and called the police again. I told them he was threatening his life and that I was concerned for his safety. My ex was taken to a hospital, and he’s alive thanks to me. 

Every now and again I’ll get a call from an unknown number and it’ll be my ex calling to tell me that I fucked his life up and that because I had the dog taken away, I was a monster. I wish I hadn’t called the police a second time. I wish I had let him commit suicide because it would make my life so much easier now. I can’t handle getting random calls and messages from him making me feel guilty for trying to do the right thing and am in the process of getting a restraining order. I feel awful for wishing he was dead. I feel like such a horrible person for fantasizing about what it would have been like and for what my life would be like without him. 

But a good thing that came from that is the dog is much happier now. He’s living with my ex’s mom, who is a wonderful woman that lives on the other side of the country. I get pictures of the dog occasionally and he looks like he’s living his best life.",07Aug2019,7

79,"     A big misconception we have is that the robots taking over one day paints a picture of physical robots, when it’s not. It’s our technology, and they don’t attack us physically, but mentally. We destroy our minds and emotions by watching porn or obsessing over social media or wasting so much of our time on pointless scrolling. We aren’t educating ourselves or making use of our time. It’s a time killer and it wastes our life. Even in “social” settings, people make sure to get something for their online presence. Some people care more about their online persona than their actual physical self. Social media was introduced as a way to stay connected, but it really only drives us further apart physically. At dinners, humans sit right next to each other with their faces in their phones. In the car, instead of taking-in the world around us, we bury our heads in our phones. How can we explain to kids that they’re too young for social media or cell phones when it’s the lifeblood of adults? The wild thing is we don’t grasp how addicted we are. We cannot face boredom so we begin to scroll. It’s our current addiction. We sit down, phone. The room grows quiet, phone. You don’t feel like getting out of bed, phone. You’re about to go to sleep, phone. It’s more apart of our lives than our significant others. We are so disconnected from the world around us. We reach for the phone as soon as our mind grows still. Do people still think to themselves regularly anymore? We must be entertained or be consuming at all times.
     Are we naive enough to think that we’re different and we can handle it when others can’t? You can think of that one person who spends way too much time on their phone, but how far off are you from them? You’re on the same road they are, whether you want to admit it or not. The robot you fear isn’t generations away, it’s the phone you trust that’s infiltrated your life and is poisoning your mind. You’re giving “them” your data, your likes, dislikes, location, browsing history, shopping history, everything. The robots aren’t coming to capture you with force, they’re learning you inside and out in order to manipulate you. Why fight with violence when you can trick them into hurting themselves?
     I began to think of how I’m going to raise a kid in this society of technology: the internet, smart phones, and social media. I want to protect them from it all, but why am I not protecting myself from it? I don’t want them to have a social media because I don’t want them to get caught up in the bullshit of it all, yet I’m on it... I don’t want them incessantly dependent on their phone, yet I can’t go anywhere without it... I don’t want them looking at smut on the Internet, yet I do all the time (part of which has caused major damage in my marriage)... I don’t want them comparing themselves to those they see on social media or television, yet I do it all the time... I don’t want them to envy things they see on social media or television, yet I do all the time... How oblivious can I be to not see that technology negatively affects me and I’m too ignorant to see it’s hurting me in all the ways I don’t want it to hurt my kids. You raise your kid less now than ever. You can protect them from so much at home, but as soon as they get online, they learn about everything you try to keep from them. The bad part about that is you can’t explain it in a guiding light. They can only process what they’re seeing with their pre-pubescent mind. It can destroy their perception of some things before they are ever taught it or experience it in real life.
     The mind is so fragile. Even at 28, my mind still deceives me. I had a rough time in my twenties because of it. Parts of my marriage struggle because of exposure to pornography, in general, but also because of how young I was. I never struggled with violence, cursing, crude language, or sexual situations because my parents exposed me to it under their supervision. But seeing porn from an undeveloped brain, I was forced to create my own criteria for it and how it looked and was supposed to be, not knowing that it’s nothing like that and it’s toxic to think of it the way that I did. My only experience with sex before Hannah was through porn and the tall tales my friends would share. Of course, once I began to experience it for myself, it wasn’t going to live up to the standards I had created for it. I always thought I could handle more than most, but my ego and pride allowed myself to destroy my perception of something that was supposed to be so special, shared with someone emotionally. I don’t want my kids to make the same mistakes I did, but technology will make that impossible.
     How can I want things for my kids that I don’t want for myself? How can I be an example and a hypocrite at the same time? How can I shelter my kids from an addiction that I suffer from myself? Do as I say, not as I do. It’s time to begin to think deeper, begin to think about future generations, begin to think about the consequences, begin to recognize the damage done and do something about it.
     The robot war has already begun... and we’re losing.",07Aug2019,2

82,"So first of all, cool sub! I had been looking for something like this for a long time.

Buckle up and get a bucket of popcorn, because this will be a long post.

This year, I planned my holidays 2-3 months in advance. I booked a hotel for 3 days in a distant city - about 3 hours and a half by car - close to the boundary, there's a pretty nice castle there, alongisde beautiful sea and nice historical buildings.

Incidentally, a good friend lives there. I have to stress that I didn't go for her, I mainly wanted to see the castle and cross the border to see some cities on the other side too. Add to that that she is a few years younger (not underage though, by a matter of months), has a boyfriend, and I was going with my mother, so I had absolutely no intention to get anything from her.

When I told my friend that I was going to visit her city and she immediately suggested she would show us around. I gladly accepted and told her the days I would be visiting. We arranged to meet the first day, as soon as I arrived, for an aperitif and a quick tour of the main places around town.

We did exactly that, then agreed to meet again before we departed. The second day my mother and I saw the castle and wanted to cross the border, but it turns out she had forgot her passport home, so she couldn't come and I didn't really want to leave her alone. I should mention fuel prices are way lower in the neighboring country and because of that I was planning on refueling there, so I was quite disappointed. My friend, once she found out, offered to go with me in the evening, so I agreed and proceeded to pick her up after dinner. Originally her boyfriend had to come too - and at this point I was glad he would, because I didn't want to cause any trouble just because a girl was going out with me alone for one night - but he reportedly didn't feel like going out that night for some reason so only the two of us went.

We had to travel roughly 30 km to get to the nearest city on the other side of the border, so we turned on the radio and sang all the way to the place. When a song from our shared favorite singer came up, we sang it so passionately we both ended up crying. She even kept saying ""aaawww"" in the cutest voice, broken by tears. That was when I knew I was going to be disappointed.

I was sitting in my car with a girl I was obviously into. We were both moved by the music. We were driving on a panoramic road by the sea, during the night, and nobody else was there with us. I felt the urge to hug that girl or even kiss her, and yet I knew I couldn't. She had a boyfriend! And beside that, even if I could get over the age difference, the distance was a big problem.

Knowing all this, when we got to the gas station, I refueled and then didn't turn the radio back on when we left - I didn't want any more of that drama. It wasn't long until the city we wanted to get to, but unfortunately there was no parking place to be found, so we crossed the border again and just stayed in our country for the evening. She showed me around some more places, even brought me to some romantic ones, always mentioning how she had been there with her boyfriend. I then drove her back home, we kissed goodbye (on the cheeks) and I departed to my hotel, already feeling a bit empty inside. The next day - yesterday - I left and everything was, of course, archived. She's been talking about her boyfriend all day now and it's not really helping.

I think my problem here is that I don't really have many friends around home - most live quite far - and I've been single for so much time that at this point pretty much any experience with a girl is something I don't forget easily. This girl isn't like any other girl either. Apart from being physically attractive, she spreads joy just by talking at her! She's never sad, and even when she is, she somehow finds a way to laugh it off. It's only natural that people like her and it's just as natural that now I'm here missing not only her, but some kind, ANY kind of real life human interaction.

So anyways, this was my rant. I would be happy to hear your comments and your suggestions. Thanks for reading!",07Aug2019,2
83,"I have been thinking about this guy for 4 days. I'm stuck on this image of his face. His eyes. They were piercing blue. Piercing, but still gentle. Passionate. Sadness, too. I think the sadness is what effected me the most. Like looking into a mirror, his eyes reflected back at me a pain I was familiar with too. A longing, a searching. A deep need that was not filled.

I looked back at him, knowing him, recognizing him, connecting with him. Living in these moments on the exact same frequency.

Has anyone ever had this type of connection with someone? How did you react? How often does this occur? I've had intense eye contact with strangers before but this was like I could sense his emotion.",07Aug2019,2
84,"This is kinda like a r/TIFU but it didn’t happen today so I’ll post here. 

So I’m sitting here waiting to get a piss test and somehow my mind just went back to boot camp. In particular this one memory. 

So, we were at the rifle range. Every time we finished shooting at a distance we would be cleared which was done by putting us all in a line shoulder to shoulder and breaking the rifle in 2 pieces then putting it over our shoulder and the person inspecting us would just come walking and looked through the barrel of the rifle to see it was empty. 

Well, we had done this like 5x before so nothing new. Except this time the one inspection us was this female marine... she was around 5’1 maybe max 5’2. Now, I’m not the tallest guy but I’m not the shortest. I’m 5’11. She was coming up to me and everyone next to me was significantly shorter so, I leaned down so she could grab the rifle and look into the barrel and oh my god. All hell broke lose. She got so ducking mad lmao like, at the time I didn’t think anything about it, I was just trying to help because I didn’t think she’d be able to reach the rifle in less I bended down a little but yeah.. looking back it wasn’t the best decision.

I picked two saved numbers to call today at random and they were neighbors! Like for example, one was 555-7654 and the other was 555-7653.

88,"For context, we work at a grocery store where I'm a cash supervisor and he's a bagger (gets buggies and does other errands around the front end). The things I know about him are: he's around 40, he's ESL (I believe he's Colombian), he's worked here for two months, and he used to own his own business and lost it to alcohol. I am a 28 year old white woman who has worked there for 11 years. 

I'm honestly kind of baffled that he perceived my attitude that way, but I guess it explains a bit? Here I was thinking he was acting a little dickish when I inquired about a task or asked him to do something- he'd get an expression of poorly concealed annoyance and go quiet. 

FWIW, I've been told by other coworkers and cashiers that I'm a good supervisor. So I'm kind of at a loss. Just wanted to post about it and see if anyone had any feedback.",07Aug2019,2

You and i
We are eternally graced
By sunshines and moonlights

By the river, under the moon
In the shaggy barn
Living with no other thought 
Than to love and be loved

A chilling, cloudy night
I close my eyes seeing you
With devils and demons, in my dream
A thunderous and shattering light

In the shaggy barn 
Cold and stupefied, i woke up
Demons and devils inside me
My love i cannot see

Searching everywhere 
My love i cannot find
In the galaxies above 
And the oceans below

So i whisper

We loved with a love
That was more than love 
For many far wiser than us
Noone can dissever my heart 
From your heart

But The stars never rise
The winds never stops
Under the moonlight 
Beside the ocean breeze 
I wait i wait and i wait 

Now, i lay down by the night-tide
Under the moonlight
Thinking of my love
You and I

96,"We were together for 3 years. We were each other’s first real relationship and High School sweethearts. We lived 30 minutes away so we typically saw each other 1-2 times a week. We were great for a long time but then she broke up with me and I was blindsided and devastated. 

Two days late she texted me and wanted to give me another chance. I jumped at it with joy. We were really good for awhile then things got bad again. She started acting very shady. She hung out with new friends and went to some sketchy places to smoke weed and drink which she knows I’m passively against. We shared locations with her and I noticed she was at some of her guy friends house multiple times a week. I asked her about it and she swore up and down they were just friends. I trusted her, she was always vehemently against anyone that cheated. 

Our texting has been slower (not at all on my end) and one night I was having a really rough night and asked her if she still loved me. She beat around the bush and then admitted she didn’t feel it anymore. I was crushed. Again. 

I meet up with her to say our goodbyes, but things went from sad to hot and heavy and we left as friends with benefits?  It was very confusing for a couple weeks bc she texted me very often, we meet to hookup, went on dates, but she would refuse to say we were dating. I kept pressing her why and she just says that she’s changed. 

I ask why she wouldn’t want to be “official” but do all the things dating implies and I say the only conclusion is that she wants another guy. She finally admits she was into another guy and lo and behold it’s the very ones I was suspicious about and questioned her on. My trust was destroyed. She swears nothing happened between them physically and I want to believe her but I just can’t trust her word. 

We have since said our goodbyes, but she made it seem like she wanted to come back in the future if she felt ready. I really want her back because she was great to me for 2+ years and was only shitty towards the end of the relationship. 

I obsess over her. I don’t know why, she treated me like shit. But I still can’t get over her and want her back.

At work, my boss was recently fired, then they begged her to come back so that she can train her replacement. That's not the stressful part. The stressful part is that she used to go to bat for me and I had no idea just how much she did for me until they took my freaking heater away saying ""It's summer you don't need a heater."" Tom, it's summer OUTSIDE. OUTSIDE. Here you keep it cold as Hades balls and tell us to suck it up. So I brought a space heater and now you're bleating fire hazard. You're full of shit.

105,"I'm in a new relationship with a man. I've never been in a relationship with one before. I'm just a regular gay woman. But I feel so safe and secure with him.

I've been through some stuff which makes it hard for me to open up to a person and reciprocate anything. Connecting to people and attaching is really really really easy. It's a little bit of a problem for me, but I'm fine. I just get hurt a bit too often.

My dad left and was never really in my life, ever. Because of that (I think it's the cause), I find it really easy to connect to middle aged men and I get really upset if I'm let down. Like my dad never came to any of my sports games, concerts, scholarship ceremonies, etc. When a coworker didn't come to a presentation of mine, I was really hurt. I know it's not that big of a deal, but it just hurt.

I have a similar issue in relationships. My first relationship was abusive, in my opinion (she doesn't think so). She regularly hit me. Like included punching, kicking, and slapping. She never threatened my life, but she sort of made me do other things I didn't want. 

I was sexually assaulted when I was in 6th grade, so she knew I was uncomfortable with male genitalia. She's trans so she knew I was uncomfortable with any sexual relation with her. She tried to make me perform oral on her, but the first two times I broke down crying. There were about 3 days in between the two occurrences. She had me watch heterosexual porn to become more comfortable with having sex with her. I didn't want to any of the times we did, but she eventually got me to let her use my genitalia as a temporary home for hers while he ""had sex"". I didn't say no, so that's my reason for blaming myself. I don't know. To some people it's dumb but that's how I see it.

So with that and then anything after that, I just find it hard to go with anything. I've always been the one to take care of the other person. I've paid for things. I've planned things. I've had to make the changes and accommodate when things went wrong. It's just how it was. I wanted to make my partner feel so loved.

This relationship is so different. I still try to care for him as much as possible, but things are so different. I feel like he genuinely cares about me as a person and wants to do things with me out of interest and not obligation. I've never had anyone tell me the things he does. No one has taken me on a date before. I feel so happy and safe with him. 

The safe thing is HUGE for me. I've either felt like I had to brace everything for the partner or that it was just bad and I wasn't safe in general. This time, I just feel like he's treating me so well. Like I didn't do anything to deserve it and I don't even know how to start reciprocating because I didn't know someone would do that for me. God, I can't get enough of this feeling. 

I don't know why I needed to give every detail of my relationships with my dad and past partners, but it made sense for the thought of how I feel now. It's a huge contrast. And he points out that I talk around a whole story before I get to the actual point, which is what this is. But I just love spending time with him. He makes me incredibly happy and he makes me feel really great. The sleep deprivation kind of evens it out. Haha, I'm kidding. I'm so grateful for him and him showing me that people can treat other people like this. Like a relationship doesn't have to be one way. There doesn't have to be one taking care of the other only. 

I know this seems dumb, but this is just what I knew before. I'm sorry this realization is probably super obvious, but I guess I'm naive that way. Now I have to work on making him feel the same way he makes me feel. He's comforting and loving and so damn romantic. Idk if I can do the romantic part as well as him, but I can try to be sweet. I'm just so happy that I feel this safe. That's a huge deal for me. That's all. Goodnight.",07Aug2019,1
106,"First post on this sub.
It'll be long but I did my best to craft it well for your entertainment.
I don't really have anyone in my life who would be interested in hearing about this but I crave any form of feedback. 

I've been on an internal journey to figure out why I have a panic attack every time I make the effort to exercise. I believe I've found it.


Running the mile in middle School. The school used a soccer field, so it was four laps around. 

I knew damn well that I absolutely could not do it. But it was required and it had to be with the class. I weighed which kind of social suicide I preferred. 

Deciding on being known as the kid who refused to do more than a walk, I managed to find a few other people who planned on walking it. They were basically protesting what they saw as the idiocy of government mandated fitness testing. So I linked up with them and breathed a little sigh of relief that I wasn't going to be alone in my lastness. 

Things went well for a lap and a half. 

Each time the fit kids would lap us they'd say encouraging things. The next half lap is when the deep cut began. 
One by one my rebellious possy decided to give it a real go, egged on by the supportive class. 

I was going to be alone for the next two laps. 

Now, it's worth noting that the diagnosis for my mental disorder/s was fresh at this point. I'd barely begun to grasp the dimensions of how I functioned differently, let alone unplugging and reworking the wiring in my brain. So you had there a kid who was already a social outcast before the diagnosis, and was newly in the throes of grasping that she really, honestly, clinically, was different. Plus, you know, puberty. 

Realizing I was alone, I looked to the crowd of kids who'd finished already. It was more than half. Their body language clearly showed that they just wanted to go inside. They got increasingly anxious. 

Sticking to my guns, I dug in my heels and walked another lap. At this point, everyone but me was done. This is when a switch flipped for the crowd and the cut hit an artery. 

Most of the kids banded together to yell encouraging things at me. While the words they used were the same as before, the tone was impatient and frustrated. I mean, they thought I was just being insolent, what with the pretence that I was protesting. 

I came into this thinking I'd handle my peers being mad at me better than failing miserably with my best effort.... but it was in this moment, with one lap to go, that I realized what everyone else in my disbanded group of rebels must have realized-- that they'd be much kinder to someone who tried their best and failed than they'd be to who I am right then. 

I gave in. I did a full-blown run for half a lap before collapsing after tripping on a root. I laid there for several moments, tears welling in my eyes, considering running off the field entirely. Just away. But I wouldn't have made it beyond the property line of the school and goddamn that'd be even more embarrassing. 

It was at this point that a popular girl ran up to me and “helped"" me up. From afar, I'm sure it looked sweet but she squeezed my arm far harder than necessary while attempting to jerk me to my feet. I was too heavy for her strength. I tried to catch myself but the jerking motion pulled my feet out from under me. So I crashed back to the ground. It must've looked like I was throwing a tantrum. More condescending yells from the crowd. The popular girl backs up but doesn't back down.

I was bruised from the falls and covered in dirt. I'd twisted my ankle.

I shuffled to my feet and began to run again, more like a hobbling jog, putting no effort into holding back my tears. The popular girl stayed beside me saying “you can do this"" tinged with a tone of “why can't you do this?"". For all I know, she was actually being sweet at this point but I'm telling the story from my perspective. 

When we finally reached the end there was no sound of triumph. No expression of concern for me, not even from the teacher. I heard a few “finally""s. 

Looking back, I can't say I really blame them. What they saw was a girl who refused to run but was peer pressured into it. I was an out-of-shape pushover. A couple of the kids present that day must've seen an opportunity in this since they became my bullies for the rest of middle school. Nothing harsh. But enough to feel victimized. 

A healthy brain would have interpreted this experience as a call to action to get into shape in order to assure that this never happened again. In fact, I bet authority figures were banking on the assumption I'd think that way. I bet that's at least partially why they make us do it together.
But I wasn't equipped to have this thought. 
Instead, I outwardly stayed silent while internally, systematically, murdered all hope that I'd experience situations like this any differently. I triumphed in doing so. In fact, it was the first time I successfully, with intention, rewired my brain. So you could say, that the platform my new brain rests on, to this day, is that shift. 

I'm now essentially incapable of imagining how things could be different. But at 25, the neglect has begun to catch up to me. My body's getting too old to cover for me anymore. I'm philosophically feeling the pressure too, as I have only a few years left to ever experience what being young and fit is like. 

The panic attacks must be from how I'm experiencing that fateful day again, but this time in my mind, with nowhere to run, and there is no crowd.

Thank you for your time. &lt;3",07Aug2019,1
107,"I've just come home from a lovely night out at the pub, having drunk about 4 pints of beer. Not *too* drunk but slightly more than tipsy.

109,"TL:DR apparently I'm a mouthy know-it-all at work and I have no idea how to stop


I feel like I am a person that has a hard time hiding their true self/ blending into certain scenarios. I used to think there was nothing wrong with this until I started having issues at work.


I essentially work construction, a place where I really felt like I could be myself and nobody would give a shit. So I went on being myself. I didn't really fit in and got a lot of shit in the field after being genuine. I got called a lot of things I wont go into detail about, but mostly because of my interests. I tried really hard to not be myself and hold back from telling them to get fucked. I mostly made myself the butt of the joke and tried to make it as ridiculous as possible, so even if it was mean I could maybe find it a little funny. It kinda worked, but some coworkers just kept laying into me. I tried laying back into them, but that made stuff worse.


I won't bore you with the rambling, but essentially my workplace relations with the people that matter (my foremen) have gotten pretty bad. I honestly don't even know how considering I rarely talk to them. I get the feeling my coworkers have been talking poorly about me behind my back.


It all came to a head one day when I was called to meet with the owner and he basically said that he had a hard time finding a job for me because none of the foreman running jobs wanted to take me. This came mostly as a shock because nobody had pulled me aside for a serious talk until now. I knew some people didn't like me, but for *everyone* to not like me?


It reminds me of that saying where everyone is the asshole maybe youre the asshole. I feel pretty shitty about it. It feels pretty shitty to go to work knowing my foreman probably doesnt want me there and had to take me. And I honestly don't even know what i did.


I'm of the mind that I'm the asshole. I'm doing something wrong, but I don't know what. I thought I was ""keeping my head down"" like my other trades friends have told me to do, but clearly I'm not doing a good job.


What am I supposed to do? I don't know how to keep my head down. I've been told i have a problem of speaking up when i shouldnt. how do I keep my mouth shut? I really do care about construction and want to learn. I want to do a good job, but I feel like I'm royally fucking it up.",07Aug2019,1
110,"I’m grinning ear to ear right now because it feels so serendipitous. I used to work for a tv station as an intern for my sophomore year and absolutely loved it. I loved the team and the work and how much freedom I had to try new things. I even got to host a show and be on local tv! 

One of my old coworkers got a job at a bigger news station and my old boss called me today. He said they had been doing interviews and narrowed it down to 3 people but if I was looking for work, he’d rather have me in a heartbeat. I’ve just recently started looking for jobs again too. So I just sent in my resume and cover letter. 

My experience is perfect for the position and my friend who still works there told me the whole team was talking about how great it’d be to have me back today. 

It just made me so happy to know 3 years later they remember me and want me back as an employee! The past year I had to take medical leave from uni for GI issues and became very depressed as a result. I also had to turn down an amazing post grad job offer which broke my heart. 

I’ve been doing a lot better since working with a new GI doctor and psychiatrist this summer and am excited that my life could be moving in a positive direction.

And as you’ve probably guessed by now, I always find someone new at that point. I have no sense of self because I’m always losing myself in someone else. 
I broke up with my ex yesterday after realizing this and after he ignored me bc I was having a depressive episode. I guess he realized he likes his women happy. I haven’t felt for anyone the way I felt for him however, I don’t actually think it was love. I think we just trauma bonded. I guess I  don’t know what it was but I know it felt good... and bad. It felt good to feel someone was as entangled with me as I was w/ them. Maybe that’s it. I can’t figure out why exactly it hurts as much as it does.
