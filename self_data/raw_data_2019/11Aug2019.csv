0,"Its so crazy how in high school, they seem like the top of the chain, like so powerful and so untouchable, in a respectable way. I always admired the class president because he was so put together and successful. I always wondered if I could one day be like him; that perfect image of what an ideal kid looks like, the one who volunteers after Sunday church and creates Facebook birthday fundraisers for children‚Äôs cancer and I thought about what it would be like, to be a person who nobody had doubts about.

And now here I am, smoking from some shitty gatorade bong in a hot tub, 4 years later. He knew my name and what I was up to and we actually just talked like normal fucking people that were on the same level. It‚Äôs so weird how we form mental barriers like that. Treat people like they aren‚Äôt even people. Create road blocks where they aren‚Äôt needed. Idiolize the image of somebody without thinking about what they‚Äôre like without the medals and nametags and fancy galas. Because at the end of the night, we were both just people talking in a hot tub.",11Aug2019,57
1,"I just got my CNA (certified nursing assistance) and I have an interview at a hospital Monday. I am scared that during the interview I‚Äôll screw up some how. I‚Äôm eighteen and just a kid still, my school never tough me how to do interviews or prepare for them. I have never worked anywhere so my resume is very short. The one thing I know is I want to help people get better when they are sick. 

But I‚Äôm scared and some advice would be nice, my parents don‚Äôt really understand my anxiety and are no help. The day of my interview before it got rescheduled, my mother said that my make up was not done enough ( had on natural make up, so to not look out of place), and my hair was horrible, ( I spent an hour on it). The cherry on the cake was that my dress that I felt confident in was ruined and I could not find another outfit that gave me that confident.",11Aug2019,1
2,"My life feels like a mess. I know it really isn‚Äôt, but it feels so hopeless at times. At least it is not as bad as it could be. I am in my early 20‚Äôs. I am educated and employed yet I am so unfulfilled and disgusted with my life. I am losing touch with my family and the few friends I have left. The harder I try to hold on; the further they slip through my hands. Meanwhile, everyone I knew in college and in high school is getting married, having kids, buying houses/vehicles, etc. They are all too busy to do anything with anyone who is single or they just do things with their married friends. Honestly, I don‚Äôt blame them at this point. I am becoming so toxic and crazy it is probably better if they maintain a safe distance from me. I have nothing that really matters anymore. I can‚Äôt think of the last time I was genuinely happy and content with life on a daily basis. 

I have tried religion but it still leaves me feeling empty. My family was very religious growing up. It has been hard to swallow the idea that the life I was told I should live through out my adolescence does not pan out in college, maybe even in adulthood in general. I wonder if this college experience is the exception or the rule? I watched many people of various backgrounds and faiths in my time in undergraduate and graduate school indulge in alcohol, drugs, sex, etc. as much as they wanted, yet none of the punishments or rewards preached to me at a younger age have come to pass. I feel more like I have been punished. 

Sorry for the verbosity. I just wanted to get some of this off my mind.",11Aug2019,1
4,"I lost my job back in March. I've been freelancing as a photographer and sort of making ends meet. When things got a bit tougher I had to take out the $5000 I had in my 401k to give myself a few more months. Now, I am at my last stand. I'm up for a job that could help tremendously but wont find out till next week. Idk what to do if I don't get it. I'll have to go live on a couch till I find something steady. I have enough to get me through this month, but when the 1st comes around, I have no idea what i'll do. I signed up for unemployment too late because my pride got in the way. I don't even know if that money will come in time. It wont be enough quite frankly. I'm writing this now because Im panicking. If anyone has any ideas I'd be incredibly grateful. I'm not looking for a handout from anyone. Just maybe some advice from someone whos gone through it.",11Aug2019,2
5,"So to start off, I don't want you to think I'm bragging or showing off, or some dumb shit like that. Anyway, people usually tell me I'm very handsome, I get a lot of people staring at me, a lot of girls hit on me, comments when I walk by the whole nine. My problem is that my self image is horrible. I can't seem to make me like myself like other people do. It's frustrating to not see what other people see. I've always had terrible self-esteem. I don't know how I can get better and honestly I have no idea how to better my self image.",11Aug2019,1
7,"when i was drinking a lot i simply wanted to be drunk to escape. i would get drunk in the morning as fast as possible but now, i don't think about it until the evening time and not even to the same degree.

it's mainly out of boredom. i work a lot i handle my shit every day, then on a saturday night like tonight i just feel a bit bothered that i don't really have friends or a girlfriend to spend time with and pretty much no social life at all... otherwise i wouldn't sit and drink like this.

i drank 3 bottles of wine this past week like a bottle at night but i don't sit all depressed like i used to so it's okay right? i'm just SO FUCKING BORED in this apartment alone how could you not want to drink??",11Aug2019,2
8,"As title states. I'm 33/m, in case it's somehow relevant. My life is an absolute mess. I'm feeling extremely hopeless. I've struggled with crippling depression (medicated+therapy) most of my life. But this year so far has been the worst period by a pretty large margin. I apologize for being vague, I just don't want some personal information/details out there in public. But I'm posting here, looking for a location if there is a place people are interested or looking to talk. I'm feeling very alone in the world right now. 

I have a great job, that I'm fantastic at, which is about the only thing I have going for me at this point in time. As well as an almost 9 year old male poodle I love to death. 

If you have any advice on where to go, or are interested in talking more let me know. Please and thank you.",11Aug2019,3
9,"Now, I‚Äôm not saying this in a way in which I think they are less than. I‚Äôve certainly had my fair share of health issues but none have been chronic, and I am technically mentally and physically ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù. I would definitely describe myself as someone who does care deeply for those who are ill or disabled or disadvantaged etc. and I always have been. It‚Äôs something my parents have told me has been engrained in my personality since I was a young girl.

Anyways, the men that have pursued me in the past 10 or so years (I am now 25) always turn out to have some sort of disability. They are not obvious to me at all. All men were undiagnosed before I would eventually figure out something was different and I would tell them to see a professional where they would ALWAYS receive the diagnosis that I had suspected. All four men are men I have been really attracted to, and two of them, I loved and currently do love. Now it‚Äôs hard to say that it‚Äôs ‚Äúlike attracts like‚Äù because I am neither bipolar, histrionic, borderline personality disordered, or autistic (the current man I love has been suspected by his doctors to be autistic but is yet to receive an official diagnosis). These men are considered ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù in society with no physical impairment. They are all doctors and dentists (I am a dentist myself), so it‚Äôs not like they clearly struggle in life either. 

The question is why? How does this happen and why?",11Aug2019,2
10,"As soon as i walked in my house from my beach trip today, i got super depressed. I have been on more beach trips in my life than i can count.

My life here isn‚Äôt that bad, but the beach life really seems like it‚Äôs for me. Which is weird because i‚Äôve always liked the mountains better.

12,"Alright so call me out if I sound completely vain, but I have a really hard time taking to people online or trying to make friends online that could transfer into irl friendships if I know they are a guy.

I‚Äôm a girl who more easily makes friends with guys. My sense of humor, interests, and even career choice all are more male suited. I was mostly raised by my dad so this makes sense to me. Anyways, I had a really upsetting time in high school where i almost lost a friendship with a guy who I had a lot of common with because he wanted the relationship to be more. It was a bad situation, but since then I find myself not letting myself become more than an acquaintances with a guy unless I‚Äôm dating someone.

With the history out of the way, I posted a comment in my college subreddit where the point was to introduce yourself. I said my name which is clearly feminine and my interests and asked for club ideas. A guy messaged me to join this one club and I made small talk and then he gave me his number to ‚Äúask more questions or talk at all‚Äù

I‚Äôm really trying to change my mentality of not trusting guys and thinking they always have intentions, but I was raised ‚Äúsingle men and women can never be friends‚Äù

16,"‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è 
This is for those who need it, it‚Äôs gonna get better.
Mental illness is rough.
I know how bad It can be I‚Äôve been there.
You used to be able to count all my ribs, I could use them like a table. 
My arms were literally purple and black from beating myself every day, I had lost a lot of my grip strength, because of the swelling/bleeding/bruising.
I would cut myself over a hundred times a day at times.
I tried to strangle myself with a necklace.
I survived an OD
I would have several hour panic attacks, ripping hair out of my head. I‚Äôd have to be pinned down so I wouldn‚Äôt try and choke myself.
I‚Äôd use my own nails to gauge my skin out in welts.
I tried to break my hand with a water bottle, and also a door.
I was abused.
I tried to jump off a cliff.
I tried to dehydrate myself till I died
I‚Äôd have to be restrained as i‚Äôd try to break my skull
I tried to get drunk enough to drown in the tub while bleeding out.
Somehow I survived all that.
I‚Äôm almost a year clean from cutting.
I haven‚Äôt drank hard liquor in over a year and I quit smoking.
I‚Äôm on meds. I‚Äôve gained weight.
My arms are the colour they should be.
I cut out my toxic friend. 
I feel genuine happiness. I have hobbies and passions. I play D&amp;D every Saturday. I‚Äôm on our dean‚Äôs list. I‚Äôve won national awards. I‚Äôm learning to love myself.
I still have days where I feel like getting the blades out. Where I look in the mirror and cry when I see my body. I recently broke my streak for not punching myself, but relapse doesn‚Äôt destroy progress.
I take my meds every day. I value myself more. And no I‚Äôm not cured but I‚Äôm genuinely glad to be alive.
I had a health scare a few months back, I was scared. I realized, I didn‚Äôt wanna die. I have ambitions.
I wanna be a famous author. 
So if I can come back from all that and survive, you can get through whatever you‚Äôre going through too. Life can be stormy, but storms don‚Äôt last forever.
You have to take the first steps, it‚Äôs scary asking for help but I promise you‚Äôll thank yourself later.
Good lucküíñ",11Aug2019,471

I never imagined I would spend so much time feeling I don't fit- feeling like a disappointment, or a mess. I use to imagine I would grow up and follow hard work and passion to my purpose... no little girl dreams of growing up lost and broken.

Fast forward to recently: Met this amazing girl on hinge. We‚Äôre the same age. Talked for days straight texting and snapping and learning everything about each other. She‚Äôs even better than I thought. 

Decided to go out Saturday, but she realized late she‚Äôd have plans with friends, BUT she bailed on them to hang with me (she claimed she didnt want to go anyway). Conversation keeps going great, We both wanna hang sooner than that, so we took Friday off of work this week to have a late lunch and drinks and it went great. We picked up right where our texts left off. 

We planned to have a second date tonight (the initially planned upon date night) but she bailed late this afternoon with a family excuse. (Keep in mind tonight was the initially decided upon date night, we both took Friday off spontaneously to meet each other ahead of time). She bailed really late and is now unresponsive to my last text this afternoon (a Luke-warm conversation all day since I woke up) and leaving my snaps on watched.

38,"A few quick details about me; I‚Äôm a 19 yr old Puerto Rican college student from NYC. And I really fell in love for the first time a few months ago. That‚Äôs where this heartache is coming from.

It started last fall. The girl I was into was complicated; she did well in classes and work but had a lot of things going on with her family. 

Anyway, as we got closer, I started feeling things I‚Äôve never felt. My stomach would get this weird pain, almost like I had a flu. I‚Äôd walk her to her train stop, hug her and walk back to where I needed to be. She‚Äôd watch me as I‚Äôd walk away and shot me an always gorgeous smile. She gave me a certain feeling of assurance and happiness. When she‚Äôd miss a class, I‚Äôd worry and stress about how she was doing. However, her aforementioned problems became attached to me too. 

To make a long story short, eventually, she had to leave the city and I was left alone. After devoting my time, my emotions, my everything into her, she was forced to leave the city because of family. And while we departed amicably, I still haven‚Äôt been able to find the closure I‚Äôm looking for. 

Months after the fact, I still miss her. I probably shouldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm young and this is just the first right? But the feelings have lingered and her presence in my mind is constant. And sadly, I doubt that she can say the same.

At the end of it all, I‚Äôve never dealt with this kind of pain before. The pain of one‚Äôs first heartbreak, and the kind of emotional scars it leaves behind. To those who have been in my shoes in some respect, can you give me any advice or words of encouragement? Can you please tell me how you‚Äôve become stronger? How have you been able to overcome missing someone you once loved? And how can you leave the past in the past?

40,"My best friend is a guy I‚Äôve known around 6-8 years. He‚Äôs like a twin sibling. We text 24/7 every day for years and see each other a few times a week. He‚Äôs pulled me off ledges for years, and I pull him out of the darkness too. We‚Äôre both creatives who struggle with our mental health. We love each other very deeply. I honestly don‚Äôt know what I would do without him ‚Äî I don‚Äôt think I would still be here. Besides my SO, no one else is even remotely as valuable to me. 

The thing is, he has several other friends he ranks almost as highly, and one higher. I know the last friend ‚Äî they have been together since preschool. That friend is amazing and we get along really well and sadly he lives about 1.5 hours away so while my friend talks to him as much as me, they don‚Äôt hang out as much.

The rest of my friend‚Äôs friends live further away, but he speaks to them throughout the week and has known them all 10+ years. They are also great people.

My best friend is getting married in two weeks to the most wonderful woman. I‚Äôm also friends with her, but no where near the intimacy I share with her fianc√©. This is fine. We all love each other and have fun. My SO and I do couple dates with them all the time. These are our forever people.

I‚Äôm in the wedding, but on the bride‚Äôs side. My best friend has so many men he‚Äôs known for so long, and they wanted to keep the wedding traditional, so I never stood a chance of being included on his side. I knew this, but it surprised me when he went on the bachelor trip and I had so much FOMO! He texted me all weekend and while I never told him it honestly just hurt so much that I was not there and never would have been invited. For years now its been established that he‚Äôll be the ‚ÄúMan of Honor‚Äù in my own wedding. I expected nothing from him for his but it was so shocking to find him going away with ‚Äúall his closest friends‚Äù except me *hurt*. 

I threw the bachelorette party for his fianc√©e two weeks ago and it was great! Today I attended the bridal shower his mother hosted for the bride. It was also very lovely and I loved meeting my friends‚Äô parents. The conversation focused a lot on the wedding of course, and a big topic was the wedding party. The mothers were gushing about the groomsmen the whole time. No one seemed to know I was very close with the groom. No one knew who I was at all. 

I just sat there while the bride talked to family and the only other bridesmaid who could make it ‚Äî a girl I know but am not close with. She is far closer to than I am with the bride. 

The whole time ‚Äî while it was a very lovely party ‚Äî I just sat there realizing that I had so little purpose there. It felt so surreal. The groom is so important to me. He‚Äôs one of the stars my universe revolves around. And me? I‚Äôm just... here. His family didn‚Äôt know me. I was there for the bride but she and I aren‚Äôt even *that* close (I thought we were, but seeing her with the other bridesmaid for the first time I realized they were VERY close in a way I couldn‚Äôt relate to). I felt like I was *his* guest and not hers. Which would be fine... except no one thought I had any significance to him either.

I felt like a stranger invading someone else‚Äôs day. I felt stupid for holding my best friend in such high esteem. I felt so alone and insignificant. Its all so petty.

After the shower, I got dinner and drinks with the groom. We talked about my upcoming engagement, about his stress over the wedding, about our lives, about whatever. We literally talk to each other about everything constantly. He‚Äôs a very talented writer and showed me the letters he‚Äôs writing to each of his groomsmen as gifts. They‚Äôre beyond beautiful. And I‚Äôm such a selfish shitty person all I could think about was that I‚Äôm not in his party and so I wouldn‚Äôt get a letter myself. It shattered my heart. He‚Äôs such a huge part of my world and I‚Äôm just... so insignificant. 

I‚Äôve never felt smaller than I did today. I‚Äôm sure it will be worse at the wedding in two weeks. I feel like garbage for being so petty and selfish, but the truth is my feelings *are* hurt. 

I just wish I mattered.",11Aug2019,3

43,"It has truly been the year from hell.

I am 63/F. My 36 year old daughter died suddenly in February. She left behind a 9 year old  I am now responsible for.  The day after my daughter died, we (my fiancee too) were evicted.  We were offered a place to stay by a couple who were friends of my daughter. We only lasted 5 months there. They expected me to pay all their bills and expected my fiance to pay for everything else.

My fiance was thrown against the wall and abused. They belittled him because he was a panhandler (Huge backstory) and that he turned me from ""classy to trashy""and God, so much more. Well, he developed the 2 year itch and left.Shortly after that, these people stole my debit card and went out pf town. I called my son and his roommate came and got us.  I managed to cancel my card before my SS money hit on the 3rd. They had the nerve to call and threaten me with all kinds of shit if I did not pay their bills anymore!

My granddaughter and I are now couch surfers. My son has a roommate who has a girlfriend. Not much room here. We can only stay another month. I have a place lined up with another friend, but who knows how long that will last.

I miss my daughter, I miss my fiancee, and I really miss having my own home. When my husband died 3 years ago my whole world changed.  Little did I know how much more change was to come.",11Aug2019,3

as in, drinking a tablespoon of water will cause my tongue to swell up so much I can barely breathe.

I've been trying to avoid drinking water so maybe my immune system will freak out if I start drinking water, but so far there's no luck.

I specifically want the internal allergy to water (ie not being able to drink it) and have to survive by drinking milk or orange juice.

Before anyone asks, I basically have a kink for water harming people, and being allergic to water just seems so pathetic and stupid way for water to potentially kill you.

Does anyone know if it's avoiding something or over indulging in something that can raise your risk of developing an allergy? Should I drink nothing but water instead?",11Aug2019,0

My back hurt so bad and so consistently that I had to give up a lot of things that I liked. I went to a physical therapist and chiropractor for awhile but not that much. After over a year of this, I had an appointment to get an MRI to see what was going on, when I went mini golfing with my fianc√©e. On like the 8th hole I took my putt and felt the most excruciating back pain I‚Äôd felt yet. It took the wind out of me and I had to brace myself to not fall to my knees.

It turned out to be the ex-boyfriend/baby daddy of the girl I've been sleeping with. I had no idea that she was still with this person. Her Facebook profile says she's single.

54,"I don't necessarily want to be asexual. Over the past year, I've become so much happier with the idea of being single. I'm at a point where I just need to get my life together and once I do that, I want to travel and live as I please.

I dated a girl for a short while this year. She was a very sweet, honest person but she had some skeletons in her closet. I planned a road trip with my brother and my cousin and I was kind of annoyed at the idea of inviting that girl to the trip. She desperately needed it because she worked herself to the point of burnout. Anyway, I never even told her about that trip.

It didn't work out and we broke it off. In the past, I would have been extremely infatuated to her and gotten clingy. I would have felt a lot of pain from that breakup even though it was a short duration. But after she broke it off with me, I felt a sense of relief.

So now I'm at a point where I am very happy being single and I would like to stay that way for the foreseeable future. I just really hate having sexual urges. I hate having to take a small portion of my day to masturbate otherwise I start feeling restless (not every day though). 

But for what it's worth, I never thought I'd reach this stage. I love having nobody to answer to, nobody to commit to and I don't want to put in the effort for a potential girlfriend/partner. There are so many things I want to do in my life. I'm restricted by a lack of money right now but I'm on the path of fixing that. Once I do get enough money, there are so many things I'd really like to do. 

Sometimes I wonder if /r/NoFap is a farce but I seriously need to do something to repress these sexual urges. I'm not into hookups. I might be into casual dating but I've never tried and I don't want to put any effort into it right now. Fuck right off, sexual urges.",11Aug2019,8
55,"I'm not seeking advice or anything, ***because I've done everything... BY I MEAN, EVERYTHING*** to stop myself from doing this. Please, don't feel sorry for me, I don't need your sympathy. Just a little post to get things off my chest and put my thoughts into words and maybe get a second opinion from you guys. Let's make this quick: What's my goal? To be skinny. Why? I get compared to my naturally skinny and dainty sister a lot. How do you go about this? Working out, starving myself sometimes, intermittent fasting and jogging. **What have you done so far?**

* lost 7kg in under a year by jogging
* do cardio when I had free time
* do intermittent fasting (done I.F. since the beginning of 2019 inconsistently and consistently on May)
* avoid sugar at all cost (make sure it's at least under 30g)
* any sugar craving or high-bad carb craving I just replace it with a healthy alternative
* drink water. only water.
* reduce stress by keeping a journal to write my thoughts in, listening to music, playing a game, etc
* avoid excessive sodium 

**Things I've tried but failed:** 

* keto, paleo, OMAD, CICO, carnivore, and etc

**Why did they fail?**

* Because they were too restrictive so I changed it up a little bit by consuming less sugar, more good carbs and do intermittent fasting (this helped me lose my 7kg last year)

**How much do you weigh/how tall are you?**

* 5'2ft and 58kg (last time I weighed myself, so I could possibly weigh more than that)

That's pretty good progress, *so why do you want to cut yourself... again?*

Life's been shitty: [here1](https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/c9q5x8/can_i_rant_guys_called_me_fat_in_front_of/), [here2](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/cnk0ij/trigger_warning_got_called_fat_again_went_from/), and my relatives (yes, cousins, uncles and aunties) have always pointed out I was pretty fat. It's because my family ALWAYS encouraged to finish the plate full of rice and shit that they didn't even bother to think that it was unhealthy. Now, I think it's my fault. They don't admit it's theirs so I might as well blame myself. 

**About yesterday:**

It's been a while since I've been to a mall to buy clothes. I would usually avoid it like the plague because I ALWAYS end up buying either 2 things or nothing. Obviously my beautiful skinny sister would go shopping with me, and it didn't, at all, take her 10 min to find 5 clothes she was interested in. It took me until lunchtime (so it was like 1hr 15 min roughly) to realize, wow, nothing fit! I was all alone surrounded by clothes while my mom stood in the fitting room helping my sister change. I was just waiting silently for mom... the loneliness consumed me... I hid behind the pile of clothes to wipe the tears. I just couldn't believe she would go to my sister. I didn't want to admit this, but beautiful people do get treated pretty nicely. I just didn't expect my own mom to do the same... I didn't know what to feel at the time. After that whole thing I just got quiet and went to the school supplies area and asked mom to by 2 pens while they were now looking for good shoes for my sister to buy. I just stood there in the background, looking at my wide feet... I've been wearing the same shoes for almost 3 years now... that's what I realized. And ofc, my sister was getting new ones, and everything looked good on her. **I love my sister.** There is nothing in this world that can make me hate her except when she's being a bitch, but she really is a kind person. I don't know. I wanted to cut myself yesterday but I was doing so damn fucking well I decided to starve instead. I still had the scars on my legs from my last cut 2 years ago, I didn't want to leave any more scars. Anyway, I might not eat dinner or probably binge later, either way, I'm probably going to cut. 

**Final words?**

I love you all. I want you all to feel okay. To feel satisfied. Whatever situation you're in now I hope it gets better. I hope you get plenty of sleep and wake up with a peace of mind the next day. I sincerely love you all. I do. Reading all your posts.. it makes me feel less lonely. While I was in the mall I thought about your posts and how your situations were worse than mine which helped me stop myself from crying in public. Thank you for reading. God bless.",11Aug2019,5

As the night went on he was getting angrier and angrier just fully scaring me, I took him to a bedroom to try and calm him down because he was clearly making a scene, but he interpreted it differently and started to make out with me, I pulled out and told him it wasn't a good idea in a calm sensible way, he continued to aggressively make out with me and then started to put his hands down my pants. I was frightened and I knew it was not at all what I wanted, I had drunk that night but I was still fully conscious, I started to tell him to stop but he didn't listen, I kept asking and eventually he started to get mad and he punched me in the arm. I tried to call for help but he had blocked off the door and I felt so trapped, I eventually got out and everyone just thought I was making out with him because I am too ashamed to confess what really happened. I feel so strange like as young teenage girl I would have never imagined it to happen to me and especially not with someone that I have known since I was like 6. one of the worst things is everyday i will be walking past him in the school halls knowing what he did to me and

60,"So, last year I met this girl. I kinda liked her. But she was in a relationship with an ex friend of mine. So obviously I didnt say anything. Then she told me how abusive and manipulative he is. So I helped her out of it. I helped her with her problems as much as I could. We are really good friends as of now. A couple of days ago she told her counselor about me, and how I was a friend she can trust and share everything with. Her counselor suggested her that if everything was so good with me, why is she waiting to ask me out. She said in response that she saw me as a brother and cant do that.(She told me all of this by the way) Now the problem is, I was hurt by this a bit, but instead of actually expressing that feeling in any way shape or form, I am basically giggling like a little girl. And this is not the first time this has happened. Everytime an emotional/tragic scene comes on in any movies/shows I giggle uncontrollably.

61,"Growing up, I never managed to find myself. I have a strict father who limited my freedom, judging me according to my appearance and the people I interacted with (he went nuts when I talked to guys). His constant judgement deeply influenced me because I struggled with socially interacting with anyone; he once forbid me from talking with my recess teacher in kindergarten, who was my only friend at the time(the guy wasn't a threat to anyone). That event made me paranoid as I pondered who was considered socially acceptable in the eyes of my father. I isolated myself from other kids and earned the ""quiet kid"" title.

I've been reflecting on my past and I'm enraged. I understand being overprotective...but if it gets to the point where your child is unable to be themselves ANYWHERE because they have to adjust themselves to your foolish expectations is ultimately devastating.

I'm doing much better now. I can handle socializing quite well, of course I struggle more with the opposite gender(like everyone else) and I'm thankful to be surrounded by amazing friends who help open my mind to what the world has to offer. Thanks to them, I'm finally getting to know myself slowly and it's relieving to find something that I like! My father hasn't changed much, but most of his comments don't bother me as much.

68,"I've been a part of this subreddit for some time and I've been feeling moved to talk about my experience and maybe even get some advice. 
On mobile so apologizes for format. 

For years I lied to everyone around me. I was good at it. I kept years of lies and stories going just to keep up with the illusion that I was true. And in January of this year it got found out and my world fell apart. 

I suppose that I should start by explaining the reasoning behind it. From the help I have gotten over the last few months I started to realize that my childhood was still a dark spot in my life. Typical story. Abandoned by mother. Abusive in all areas father. I have always, and still do, struggle with the yearn of acceptance. That somebody loves me. Cares for me. Not in a singular sense. But they care about my dreams, my hopes, fears, hobbies, thoughts. That cares about me as man should care for man. And the fucked thing was I had it and lost it.

I had a strong group of friends. I loved them in my own way that I had learned. It wasn't the correct kind but the perverted love I grew up with. And some bullshit happened and I got caught up in years of shit. And it torn my group, my family up. 

My girlfriend lives with me and two other roommates. The two roommates moved out. My best friends who are a couple stopped talking to me. And I hurt my gf. Goddamn I hurt her so bad. I never meant to but I did. I've accepted that. I couldn't heal without doing so. 

The first few months were hard. I was angry hurt scared. Suicidal. It was a dark time. 

The middle of this eight months period I started accepting responsibility. And feeling a change in myself. Never wanting to hurt people like how I was hurt pushed me through the pain of figuring out why I was the way I was and accepting that I will never have a standing relationship with my family. Big ups and downs. We broke up. And the despair was the darkest shit I ever went though. I do not wish that inky depression on anyone. 

The last few months have been good tho. Some downs sure but mostly ups. My ex and I still live together. And yesterday I was told my best friend wanted to talk to me and gave me a hug and said she missed me and she understood. Doesn't even know half of the shit but she said that. Broke me down. My ex and I made love for the first one in a long time. We didn't fuck, it was love making. 

Things are turning around. Idk in what way and I'm okay with it. There are times when it gets dark for me but I fight it off. Sometimes the urge to lie is so strong I catch myself starting to slip up. It scares me. Won't lie about it. J feel that this sickness in me won't ever fully die and I have to accept that. And I have. I've accepted a lot of hard and nasty shit about myself. But there's power in it. 

If you're out there struggling with this, it can get better. It'll take hard work but maybe you'll become and better person in the end. 

TL;DR.   Used to lie but time, lost everyone, suicidal, started changing myself, and now people want to believe in me.",11Aug2019,4

75,"I'll try to keep it brief: I started going to a psychologist three months ago after two years of quite intense anxiety and low moods. My psychologist is an amazing woman and the sessions have had a huge positive impact. In these past two months especially the progress has been amazing, I am coping very well and the anxiety attacks have been mostly gone. 

But I realized that in this positivity and newfound optimism, I've started to push people away. I have especially felt that I should end my long distance relationship in order to feel emotionally independent and continue strengthening the sense of control over my emotions. To give some context, in the past I depended quite a lot on my bf's support in low moments because I couldn't cope properly by myself. But everything is going well in the relationship and the feelings have not changed.

Has anyone experienced something like this? And how do I know whether I have outgrown the relationship or if this is an irrational feeling (pushing people away to avoid getting hurt)?

For a long time now i have been struggling with anhedonia and thoughts of being dead. Family and friends tell me not to read/watch news so much. Just read about science, fitness, listen to podcasts or other mindless positive shit. But is being willfully ignorant of all the bad ok.  I really just want to disappear be forgotten and forget. I want the non-exsistance i had before coming into this world. 

Life is like a game that does not ask you to agree to Terms of service and just forces them on you. Other people are indirectly forcing you to continue to play (&lt;insert a living thing that is related to you&gt; would be sad). The system **does** forcefully make you play, because if you show intent of quitting they will do almost anything to make you stay.

At a mental institution they told me that if i am too stubborn with my anti life ideas  and refuse getting voluntary treatment they will use **involuntary** treatment. Almost ended myself after getting out of there (They still let me go becs i cooperated), but i was unlucky and my argon bottle was empty (maybe leaked out). At least now i know i can actually put a plastic bag on my head and not totally pussy out. :D

Sometimes i really hate people close to me. I know they will be sad and that is holding me back a bit. Will to live is also not that easy to overcome. Oh there is a bit of FOMO as well, i kinda wanna know what will happen in this century, but at the same time i know it will not matter in the end. How can i get rid of this hesitation, the end of summer is approaching and i made a promise to myself in the winter that i would end things this summer. I have a spot in a good uni, but i fear my mental abilities have diminished severely because i have been away from academic stuff for a year. Memory is also quite shit. Forget all kinds of things and past has become a haze. Memories have no info about when or where or with whom i did stuff. Only recent stuff has a little bit of clarity. Probably will be like this my whole life. 

Losing interest in things relatively fast. Once i can do something a little bit i will move on. Things like psychedelics are also losing their wonder. Alcohol has not been enjoyable for at least half a year already. Only thing that is constant is cigarettes, coffee and occasional weed bender lasting a week or so.

I am not looking for help, i know the ""permanent solution to a temporary problem"" bs. Just want to find a way to cause as little pain to others and be forgotten as fast as possible. Sister just went back to australia. I wonder if brother's funeral is reason enough to come back? I do not want to disturb her life much.

I don't want to be human. Having a personality disorder doesn't make life easier either.

83,"To the women in heterosexual relationships...

Please stop texting other women and telling her to back off. 

1. If she‚Äôs not your friend, she doesn‚Äôt have to care about your feelings. She‚Äôs a stranger...a grown woman with no obligation to be loyal to the relationship between you and your man. If she crosses the line, it‚Äôs HIS job to cut her off. 

2. Let‚Äôs be honest: you only texted her and told her to back off because you know if you told your man to cut her off, he wouldn‚Äôt. Or maybe you did tell him and he wouldn‚Äôt (so why are you still with him?). Either because she is just a platonic friend (and people can have meaningful friendships with other people, regardless of gender, outside of the relationship. You not allowing that is controlling.) or her and your man are doing something. If it‚Äôs not innocent and he can‚Äôt cut off one person, leave him sis. 

But stop telling other women to leave your man alone, whether they‚Äôre just friends or something more. It‚Äôs not a stranger‚Äôs job to make sure he‚Äôs loyal to you. That‚Äôs his own job. If he has a female friend that‚Äôs flirting with him, it‚Äôs his job to draw the line, not yours.

Has anyone else lived in Japan or another country and wish they could go back, despite it being not economically feasible?

91,"I've spoken aloud to myself ever since I was 8 (17 now). I do this in whispers, conversing with an imaginary character who I decided to name after my bestfriend at the time, let's call him ""Tom"". I'm hardly in contact with the real Tom anymore, and ""Tom"" never shared any similarities with the real guy, so there is no connection between them.

Disclaimer: ""he"" - referencing my imaginary friend. ""him"" doing something is me pretending to be him, and I'm fully aware of this as I do it.

To talk to Tom, I whisper to him in my normal voice. ""He"" then responds back with a slightly deeper whisper. I tell Tom what I'm going to do for the rest of my day. I tell jokes to him, ""he"" laughs back. I tell him my opinion about almost any given situation, ""he"" responds back with his opinion. I don't know how I come up with his opinions, it's just second nature to me, I've never given it much thought. I suppose I'd say that he mostly agrees with me, offers insight that I would have otherwise expanded on if asked to by a real person. When he disagrees, he normally responds very reasonably. He might tell I'm stupid as a joke, but we've never been in an argument and he's never been mad with me. Very occasionally, he'll try to calm me down.

I haven't been diagnosed with any mental illnesses. I've always strongly disliked my appearance, have bad social anxiety and depression. However, I have people to talk to. Specifically one person who I talk to almost all day, and 3 - 4 that I'll get into conversation with every few days.

93,"We are all different, and we all have a different pace we gp through life in. I will be honest, I am a slower pace, but most of my friends are extraordinarily successful for our age. 24-26 and most of them own big houses, some have settled down with kids and here I am, a single dude renting a room in a house.

It's hard to not compare yourself to their scale, or to try take up the same pace as them. I have a dofferent interpretation of life then most do- I don't use credit, I hold more value in self growth in terms of philosophy and finding a way to be content in comparison to my friends, and it does drive a rift between us. 

Everyone of us has troubles, we've all grown out of the cult we were in together, which is unique. The only age group which has. Watching them grow, but suffer under the weight of guilt, trauma, and the same abandonment issues as I have, watching how we process it differently.  As far behind as I am in wealth and occupation, the trauma has mostly brushed off. So I may be in my midwealth state, but I have to watch them all struggle with drugs and alcohol, watch them try fill the void left from the family's abandoment of them for their change in faith, watch them struggle with finding who they are. Seeing them work themselves to the bone so they don't have the energy to fight with the turmoil within.

It's just hard. We are started with the same handicap, and we are all growing out of it in different ways. I know some of them, the business owners and the guys in their 5 bedroom houses feel bad for me, but I feel equally as bad for them as they are still in the ring with their demons. 

This is a self rant,  but anyone who has gone through something similar with childhood friends, how have you managed these massive changes? 

I don't care if I ever reach the financial level my friends have. I just want to make the self loathing, denial and guilt leave them- and it's hard because they feel the same for me but in reverse, they want me to grow to their financial level.

95,"I hope this is the right place to post something like this. If not, please direct me to a more fitting sub. Thanks.

Let me preface this by saying that neither of us want a kid and that **we are very naive, stupid, reckless teenagers who don't know any better.** I am 19, my girlfriend is 17. Last night we made the stupidest decision we've ever made in our entire lives.

I went over to her house. It was the last night we would be seeing each other before I went off to college. It was about two in the morning, her family was home but everyone was asleep and we had sex at least six times for about two hours probably. Bear in mind, it was unprotected and she was not on the pill. Now I know that's already playing with fire, but it gets worse. As we were doing it, we were going for awhile until it was time for me to finish. Now normally I would pull out, I do every time we have sex and all goes just fine. This time was different however, as I deliberately did not pull out because she said she ""wasn't going to stop until she finishes"", so I finished inside of her.

We were in the heat of the moment and were too horny to actually realize what the fuck we were actually doing and how big of a risk we were taking. Immediately after I finished she got off and we checked an app she has on her phone that tells her whether or not she's ovulating... and she **was.** We immediately went into panic mode and rushed to the local pharmacy and grabbed the morning after pill. She took it as soon as we got back (so basically an hour or so after we had sex) and our worries subsided a little until we did some research and found out that basically, if you take the morning after pill while ovulating, that it only temporarily stops ovulation. From what I understand, when a woman isn't ovulating, she has a *low chance* of getting pregnant, but still a chance. So basically, the morning after pill she took isn't going to guarentee a 95% chance that she won't get pregnant like it normally would, rather, it will just temporarily stop her ovulation, leaving us to sit here and hope and pray that nothing happens. She's going to buy an early detection pregnancy test a week from now and another pregnancy test two weeks from now. Until then, all we can do is wait and hope that she isn't.

I'm sorry but I just need to write this down somewhere so that others can learn from people like me. If you are going to have sex, either use protection, make sure whoever you're doing it with is on birth control, or most importantly just do **both.** I swear shitheads like us are the reason people send Planned Parenthood ten bucks a month. If whoever is reading this has anything to say besides how fucking stupid and mindless we are, anything would be appreciated. If anything, I deserve to have a kid after doing something like this, despite **all** of the warnings I have received over the years; friends and family always telling me to wrap up, the warnings of what will happen to *me* if I get a girl pregnant, etc. I owe everybody, even God if you're superstitious, an enormous apology.

I know I'm 19 (pushing 20) with enough (or I guess *some*) maturity, decency and intelligence for my age but I am **not**ready for a kid. I am just not prepared nor mentally in a fit state.

Is there any hope for us at all? Any other recommendations you have to further prevent a pregnancy?",11Aug2019,3

I'm at band camp, and I'm switching to a new highschool so I don't have many friends. Without my friends to mess around with, I had a lot of opportunities to notice people/things. I noticed that one of the battery guys had some Mario merch and I recently got a Mario pin from an event I went to. I don't know anything about Mario and I didn't really care for it, so I asked my friend to give it to him. For some reason, he wanted to talk to whoever gifted him the pin, and he found out that it was me. I refused to talk to him at first, but I saw him after school one day and I just thought, ""Screw it, it can't go wrong"" and honestly, I'm really proud of myself.

Long story short, I come from a house where mum has been having depression since I have memory and my dad nowadays it's quite down since he had a very bad luck with health issues and grandma passed away 1 year ago, so for most part of my life I've tried to not make much issues or when I had a very bad moment, to solve it by myself as I didn't wanted to bother my parents with ""silly teenager stuff"". They had very bad moments where self-harm and suicide has been on the table, so I really didn't felt as going there and giving them more shit to worry about.

 I didn't realize till recently, when I started going to teraphy *(I started going cause I felt that I wanted to change some of my behaviours, then I discovered many things inside myself that it wasn't completely right)* that most of my relationships had been very abusive when it comes to manipulation, cheating, money issues... In that moment, nothing hit my mind and I just accepted it as part of the love. Cause romance can be painful something, right?

I was so wrong, that lead me to deal with big situations by myself and took it as normal, also because when I explained this to my family it didnd't seemed a huge deal *(bare in mind that from a problem I will maybe explain a 1% of the whole 100% situation)*. So I know it's kind of my fault as I didn't opened myself in those moments. 

But I don't know how to make them understand now that I do suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, when I explain about this process that I'm doing now to get better mental state to some of my friends or family, they react as ""noooo, is not possible, you are just having some bad days, don't be silly, with all the things you've done before"".

I don't blame them and I understand it's been my ""fault"" again because I wasn't open before to explain how I truly felt, but now I feel exhausted to deal with those comments and don't really know how to make them acknowledge that I'm dealing with something that it's really hard for myself and that I'm struggling day after day to become better, to literally not surrender and be all day in bed.

Also I had some people getting angry at me for saying NO to some of their requests, mostly because I always did it before but now I need to step aside or I know that it would lead me to a breakdown.

103,"I have a question. Lately I've not been feeling too great mentally. Well, this was a diary entry I wrote describing how I felt...

Today was really terrible because I was doubting myself all day, or criticizing what I did, said, or looked at. I was kinda forcing myself not to talk in case I screwed a conversation, not to do the extension task because I would make a mess at it, and constantly thinking about how I looked from other people's view, and thinking: why am I here? Do I exist solely to torture myself? To be of use to others? Or am I useless. I was asking myself the same question: what am I good at? What hobby is for me? And I kept telling myself I wasn't good at anything, there is no hobby for me. I am useless. No one wants me around. Why else would it be me being bullied for nearly three years? Why else would it be me with only 1 true friend? Because no one wants me around. If I tried to get into a friendship circle, I would be chucked out. Tossed around, from circle to circle, until finally crawling to the in-between, no man's land, the forgotten ground. But for now, I'm squeezing into the first. I feel like I am being accepted, but only to a certain extent.. I can see where I want to head, but it's a haze. Like there is a cloud, a cloud of difference. We are similar, but so different. My one true friend, who has stuck with me, is the one I am losing grip of. I am ok, I tell myself, it's just a phase, others have it worse, I deserve this. Only I know how I truly feel. My feelings are my problem, I don't want to drag others down with me.

Even though these people love me and only wanted to see me be happy they weren‚Äôt helpful. I let them tell me how they think the guy is feeling and what I should be doing. I knew deep down that what they were telling me wasn‚Äôt 100% accurate but I was hurting and was trying to get as much info about how he was doing (is he okay? has he been eating properly? etc etc)

I should have listened to my gut more and realised that I knew this guy and how he was actually feeling and what my actions should be. Instead I let myself listen to others and I am now just digging myself out of the hole I built. In addition, since I have begun digging myself out of the hole and stopped listening to so much talk and advice I feel a lot better about myself and the situation at hand.

So if there is one thing you should take from my little story is that you should always trust your gut, even if you think it‚Äôs wrong. You know down in your heart what is right and what is wrong. You should also know that even though the people that love you have your best interest at heart a relationship, even after is has ended, is still between two people.",11Aug2019,1

I was suicidal before accepting the job and everything but I was just so focused on passing probation and having a source of income that I thought the pride from the accomplishment of finishing a program and receiving my license and then landing a job would cure myself of being suicidal.

When I quit, I thought I was leaving toxic coworkers and that i could find something better. I had intended to go back to my previous job and since I know the managers as family friends, they were willing to let me go back. 

After I quit, I took my mini van, drove up PCH and beach bummed for a few days there. Then I came home and started having psychosis. (I'm not going to go into detail on the things I did). Then I had a suicide attempt. I was in the psych ward for 2 weeks got released. Wasn‚Äôt actually ready, went back to the ward after doing some bad things. And on the day I went back for a second time, the mini van got stolen. 

It‚Äôs been almost a year and I just really wish the mini van was still around. I enjoyed so much being at the beach and sleeping in the van at night. I wish I hadn‚Äôt even bothered to go home in the first place. 

Those few days that I was at the beach, I was basically off the grid. I figured I didn‚Äôt need much clothes and could eat off the dollar menu at taco bell or whatever and that would be my life for as long as I could keep it up.",11Aug2019,3
113,"We all know a standing desk guy and they don't shut up about the benefits of standing so I got fed up of it and remembered a condition called venous insufficiency where blood pools at the bottom of you feet it is caused by the leg veins valves not working and this happens because of standing up for prolonged periods of time everyday with no break so basically standing at a desk 9 hours per day with no break in between can cause it especially if your not going to sit for lunch breaks 
Now whenever desk guy wants to talk about his desk I just hit him with the VI thing and he shuts up

114,"Do you ever realize how deeply your past has messed you up. Like I have this fear of traveling from my family but it cuts so much deeper than that. 

Basically when I was younger if my family went on road trips I never wanted to go. I can't remember if this just built over time or if something happened to change me forever but I'd make myself so nervous that it was all I could do to not literally crap my pants. I hated not being in control of where I was going and for how long. My mom didn't seem to care less, as long as she could get where she wanted it didn't matter if I felt sick and my sister made me feel terrible. She always made it out to be I was the reason we couldn't go anywhere, stopping for restroom breaks for me took too long, I was just playing it up to be a baby and if anything went wrong it was my fault.

I'm 26 and I'm not over it. I have no self confidence. I'm afraid of making the slightest mistake, I'm afraid of ruining everyone's hard work and good time because I apprantly just ruin good things. And I feel like self confidence is the hardest thing to obtain.

I want to get a new job but it's like I can't. I feel like my application isn't going to draw attention, I'm mediocre. I feel like if I got the job I'd always be in someone's way, messing something up... I'm the reason we can't have nice things..",11Aug2019,6
115,"My dad hasn't been allowed at the house because of court order since my parents got into a fight (it wasn't big my mom punched my dad in the car so he smashed the cars console in anger) so he's not allowed at the house for 2 months at best. (My dad currently stays at my uncles/his brothers place)

Fast forward a month later to now, I told my dad about the messages I saw on my moms phone a week ago she was talking to a guy and sexting to him there was probably more between them but I couldn't look at it anymore it made me sick to my stomach

Not sure what my brothers and my dad are going to do now but it feels like my life is just falling apart like they were married for 15 years and now it's just all gone and ruined. What made me check her phone is shes always gone out with ""her friends"" every night so that's what drove my suspicion. Just felt like I needed to get this out of my system or tell someone because it makes my stomach sink every time I think about it",11Aug2019,2
116,"It's hard for me to quit beating myself up about ""wasting"" my time at college.   
  
I'm an engineer now, and I'm glad I went to engineering school, but I can't help but feeling like I wasted all of the social opportunities that college presented.   
  
I didn't meet any friends in college. I had maybe a few typical ""college"" experiences, but really didn't get out much. Now, I'm a few years removed from college, and I really regret it. It's not like I was spending all of my time studying or anything, I just didn't get out much (or at all, really.)  
  
I've always heard people say that ""college was the best time of my life"", and I really don't think that's necessarily a good thing, but I do believe that there's a lot of people out there that would say that college was a great time in their life.   
  
Now, and I don't think I'm ""weird"" or anything, but now I feel like I kind of missed out on learning how to socialize. Don't get me wrong, I work with some good people and I think we all get along pretty well, but they're all much older than I am. It's hard living in a smaller city with no friends while working a job with people twice my age. I feel like I'm back in the same situation as before, except this time I'm not missing out on the ""college experience"",  I'm missing out on my 20's. It's scary being someone who's never been in a relationship when the clock is ticking. I know that everyone will say ""oh, you're young, you've got plenty of time."" But I feel like this every year. Every year I tell myself that I need to get out there and do something.  And every year I follow that by inaction, because I don't know where to start. I don't have any real interests apart from gaming, and I think that's really contributing to my problem. I'm happy when I'm playing games with my friends, not necessarily because of the games, but because I like spending time with people. For some reason, I'm just so afraid of new connections. I'm afraid to fail, I'm afraid that people will realize that I don't really have any friends, I'm just afraid.   
  
And the situation gets worse. As I get older, even if I meet someone, won't they think that there's something wrong with me for being a virgin? For not having had my first kiss? For having no real friends?  
  
I think I look pretty normal, but I'm so afraid of people finding out who I really am. I don't want people to find out how *behind* I am, socially speaking. But it's just going to get worse as time goes on. How do I break out of this?",11Aug2019,8
117,"so. This guy I know. He hooks up with a girl. He‚Äôs not into it, but he‚Äôs got anxiety so he lies and says yes and pretends to enjoy himself
Then he goes around saying she‚Äôs a creep.
BUT HE CONSENTED
HE SAID YES
it‚Äôs shitty she didn‚Äôt notice, and it‚Äôs shitty his anxiety kept him from saying no. But he‚Äôs acting like she took advantage of him when he full well told her he was Into it and every time she double checked said yes
Also. He keeps flaking on a friend saying his mental health is too bad to go out, but will go to a hookup same day.
He‚Äôs supposed to be my best friend. He‚Äôs got a sex addiction and it‚Äôs out of control. He‚Äôs literally having sex with a different person every night (which is his choice but he‚Äôs doing it unsafely, meaning he could have and be spreading something. Also. Kids).
And he goes on about how miserable it makes him, and he can‚Äôt say no because he wants to please people (yet has no problem saying no to plans and bailing last minute)
And I tried to explain to him he needs help, and that he has an addiction which is why he feels compulses to do this but like any addiction it‚Äôs really hurting him, and he has to tell his therapist (who he just doesn‚Äôt tell shit to)
And he acts like he listens
And in the same post he made calling that girl a creep he also went on about how ‚Äòmy friends act like I do it for fun and as a choice‚Äô referring to me. He refuses to admit he has a problem, is putting himself and others at risk, made a commitment to a project with another friend and never shows up saying he‚Äôs too depressed to leave the house but will leave to have sex or buy weed.
And I‚Äôve really had enough. We‚Äôve been doing everything in our power to help him and he‚Äôs just acting like this. Also it‚Äôs totally unfair to the girl ge‚Äôs Calling a creep and to the friend he has bailed on and went out later to have sex repeatedly. I‚Äôm really done. Just needed to get that off my chest so I don‚Äôt explode",11Aug2019,1

120,"Its weird. Like, what was supposed to be fun little sex with my ex almost turned into the biggest fuck up in my life. I could‚Äôve had a fucking baby by next month bruh. I cant help but imagine where my life would be by now if that baby lived. Im sad of course but im just i dont even know im going through a whole range of emotions.",11Aug2019,0
121,Hi everyone! I‚Äôm looking for a good self help book for women. I‚Äôm looking for something to help with speaking to others more positively. Any help is greatly appreciated!,11Aug2019,1
122,I have anxiety over things like taking medications because of side effects. I worry about eating new foods because I might be allergic and die. When I‚Äôm in a car I panic that there will be an accident. I worry about dying. Yet most of the time I think about suicide and wish I was dead. What in the fuck?!,11Aug2019,3
123,"I've had a rough childhood, moved from my parents when I was 15 because they were psychologically abusive. I am 17 now (to be 18 this October), I've practically disowned them. In my mind I don't have any parents, I've disowned them. Other things I don't have is a religion, and I don't identify myself as an atheist either, I rarely even give it a moments thought because it has nothing to do with me, and only think slightly of it sometimes because I'm reminded they exist. I don't watch or care about the news. For many years I was very negative, hated myself and was worried about the world, that I didn't do enough, and hoped to achieve a girlfriend. To love someone and be loved back, and maybe be able to grow to stop hating myself in that process. My hair used to be long because I thought that was cool, I always wore hoodies and basically looked like a crazy person, oh and from the beginning of this year I basically masturbated every day and I had an online friend I've known for 2 years that caused me lots of anxiety. 

By the beginning of this summer I decided to cut my hair, buy myself some fancier clothes. I bought shirts (not T-Shirts, the shirts I bought are called ""Skjorta"" in Swedish but of course in English you can't be that precise. Just google ""Skjorta"" and that'll be the exact thing I'm talking about), some more pants (rather than just the one pair of jeans I wore every day), and while that's great and all it didn't prevent me from hating my personality- until a Japanese girl online told me ""I love myself so,  just love yourself"" I was like, what? Is it really that easy? And it was. Literally even if I masturbate I don't ""hate"" myself very much if at all, I cut contact with that other poisonus online friend and have gone to restaurants for the first time, started reading books in Japanese (I'm studying Japanese) etc. I'm also starting Karate on the 15th. 

Of course before this there have been things that have led up to the way I am now, I've changed a lot this summer but not all of my changes were made during summer, but I don't know. Even if I had some positive days I'd just go back to repeating the same thoughts and using the same paths being insecure every day for the last two years, now I just don't have those worries.

My brain is somehow empty, filled with positivity. This is an obscure reference but if this was Ni No Kuni you'd have to halve my heart and I'd probably become the same level of positive again. It's a never-ending thoughtless fountain of positivity, my brain feels ""natural."" I've even decided to become an English teacher, hopefully someone working in Japan but even if I don't wanna work in Japan in the future I can work as a teacher anywhere else. This is the path my brain and heart is urging me to take. 

  
I don't even have any ""favorite"" movies and I see a lot of positive qualities about bad movies. 

So I have to ask, is it really okay for me to adopt this kind of mindset? Is it really okay for me to not worry about global warming, politics or what's happening in the world?",11Aug2019,3
124,"In our dorm room, we share a tiny bathroom with our suitemates. It has a toilet and a sink. I'm pretty sure my roommate changes her menstrual pads in our room though. We each have bunk beds and underneath we have dressers and desks. We both agreed to change our clothes under our beds, because we can't see each other that way (due to the set up of the room). I would also like to add that because our bathroom is so small, you can hear everything people are doing in it. Sometimes I can hear her change her pads in the bathroom, but it seems she doesn't do it in there every time. The reason I say this is because I heard her changing her clothes at her desk one time, and I heard wrappers tear. Then it sounded like she pulled her pants up...and THEN she washed her hands... Why would she wash her hands right after if she wasn't changing a pad? 

We also have only one trashcan in the dorm room. There isn't one in the bathroom. I checked it, and it looks like she throws pads in there. They are rolled up and wrapped, but I know for sure what they are.... 

It's just surprising to me that she changes them in the bathroom sometimes, but other times in the room. She also brushes her teeth twice a day/flosses, washes her face twice a day, and showers often. When she puts makeup on, she'll go into the bathroom to wash her hands at least 3 times before she's completely dressed and ready. I don't get how someone who's that ""clean"" would change her pads in the room. You would think someone who changes their pads in the room would be a really dirty person...

Idk, should I tell the RA that she's changing her pads in the room?",11Aug2019,1
125,"Whenever I mess up in even a small way, I always say something like ""I'm stupid"", ""I'm an idiot"", or ""I'm retarded"". I want to stop this because I feel like this just makes me blame myself for everything.",11Aug2019,3
126,"I am alone, floating in some endless, bottomless darkness. There is no meaningful passage of time anymore; the months fly by quickly and quietly under a single contonuous, monotonous drone. It's been over a year since I've been by myself. Maybe two years? It doesn't matter. Nothing seems to matter much, now.



Occasionally, a wispy, fibrous cloud of memory will strike through me like a bolt of lightening - suddenly reminding me of what it is was like to be loved, or other times, simply serving to starkly illuminate any one of the innumerable mistakes accrued in my short lifetime... each one inexorably leading me to here, and now. 



I have lived thoughtlessly and carelessly, and those who loved me most were the ones subject to the worst of my offenses. I wish I could atone - or better! Reach my hand back into the past and actually change myself! I was so young, and so foolish. 



But I cannot go back. I have poisoned my adolescence, and emerged as a horribly malformed adult human being. I have failed myself and the only ones who cared about me, and I will never forgive myself. There is no moving forward, no improvement. There is only to float in this lonely void - and to remember, and to endure.



How wonderous it is to have someone love you. How unequivocally unbelievable and undeniably incredible... I guess it could only ever have been a fantasy. 



Perhaps I should feel lucky to have experienced anything at all. Some people aren't so lucky.",11Aug2019,1

128,"My life has been fairly decent until high school. I'm smart and got good grades up until then, when I started smoking weed and wasting time. I think that elevated my anxiety and social anxiety and I'm at a point where I don't do anything anymore. I graduated and want to go to school to be a software engineer, but do nothing to get myself there nor do I think I even want to. I've tried several jobs and none seem to fit me which is why every one I've had I've quit. Wondering if anyone feels the same way and/or has gotten past this point in their life?",11Aug2019,1
129,"I found my brother's old pair of headphones laying on the table downstairs and decided to give them a whirl just to see what they're like. I plugged them in, put them on, and played Civil War by Pink Floyd and jesus christ it's like a whole new experience. I can hear the birds in the background, it's all so clear it's like I'm actually sitting there, outside, listening to someone talk/sing/play instruments. I can hear all the pitches, the intonation, the clarity of each individual thing happening, not just a buzz of noise with some words on top (that might have been too harsh, I still loved listening to music before this). I'm just blown away by it and understand why people like listening to music 24/7 now.",11Aug2019,4
130,"The only people who say that are those who were never stuck in the first place. They're the kind of people who had a support system and resources, but chose not to use them until I guess they finally wised up. For a lot of us we're doomed and there is no hope.",11Aug2019,2
