3,"Now the title may not sound like a big deal to most people but personally I'm very happy with this. 

Around 2 years ago I was really into the whole tumblr scene and I had a really backwards mindset. 

A few strong beliefs of mine included: 

- hating anyone who was white, heterosexual, cisgendered, not suffering from any mental illness or disability, and/or rich. Because what bigoted people did 20 - 100+ years ago totally constitutes hatred and discrimination for the rest of those who fit in to these groups regardless if they were bigoted people or not. 

- Cluelessness = Bigotry. If you weren't aware that this youtuber was a gross person and you dare post any love for them online, you were a gross person too. Because you SHOULD have known and its your fault if you didn't. 

- If you did anything that was deemed ""bad"" by tumblr standards, no matter how mild or severe it was, it was 100% okay to send you death threats and leak your address and phone number. Doesn't matter if you meant anything harmful by what you said or did, it was still okay to harass you. 

- If you weren't on the left, you were a bad person. You're a republican? Sorry, youre a bad person. You support Trump? You're a piece of shit. You're a centrist? Well only good open minded people are on the left so the fact that youre undecided on this means youre a shit person with no morals. 

One day I took a break from tumblr and realized I was being a piece of shit with these beliefs. I decided to remove myself off of the website and try to start focusing on how to move on from this mindset. 

At first it was difficult to not stick with my old ways and just brand people/things as good or bad just from what I saw on the outside, but in time I managed to be okay with the fact that not all 7 billion people on the planet are going to think exactly like me. 

This year in my math class I became friends with a few people who sat near me. We would entertain each other whenever the class ran slow and they were all pretty funny. One day one of my math friends stated that they were a republican and they liked Trump as our president. Had this been merely a year ago I would've stopped talking to him immediately and told him off for being a racist. I even had the small urge to do exactly that in that moment. Instead, I just said that that's pretty cool and it's rare to see people who support him in the area we lived in. We simply moved on to a different topic after that. 

This was a pretty big deal for me because of how much I used to hate republicans and conservatives. Just hearing those words used to boil my blood, but the fact that I'm able to maintain a friendship whilst looking past someone's opposite opinion makes me proud of myself and how far I've gotten. 

TL;DR 
I was able to look past my friend's political stance and I'm incredibly proud of myself.",27May2019,0

6,"I’m a 21M, and I’ve struggled with relationships in the past. I’ve had two relationships in the past - one being 3 years and the other being a year.

I was cheated on in my first relationship, and then I was physically and emotionally abused in my second one. So I had a lot of trouble trusting again, and plucking up the courage to believe in myself more.

I got my results from college back in August of last year, and up until then I had no interests in university. Then I had an epiphany... just move away from the area, but my brain to some good use and pick myself back up - and believe in myself. So, with a click of my fingers I rang up several universities and ended up ringing my parents at the end of the day telling them your boy is going to university.

Fast forward a month and I’m in university and I was previously chatting to a girl who was also attending the same university. We go out drinking, hit it up and before we know it we begin dating. For the duration of the academic year, we spent every minute of every day with one another. She has always been over at my place, and we’ve studied together and attended every single lecture together (we do the same course).

As we finished both of our exams for the first year she asked me: “When we both have our degrees would you like to move in with me and my parents or vice versa whilst we save for a mortgage on a house”...

Not only did I know I loved this girl before, but after this particular comment my heart grew fonder. She reminded me how to love again, she reminded me how to be a goofy idiot and she reminded me just how much I am worth as an individual. She will never see this as she doesn’t have reddit, but I am forever grateful and proud of this girl. I love her with all my heart, and she is the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon.",27May2019,114

15,"I had my interview a few days ago, and I can't help but think that I did not do well. I was applying for a med school program that will allow me to shorten the years in premed and med by 2 years, and it already includes the internships needed. I was very happy that I was included in the list of qualifiers for admission because they only consider the top 100 scorers in a certain entrance exam. The only thing that was left to do was to ace the interview and be a part of the top 20 boys and top 20 girls who will be admitted.

I think the biggest mistake I made was mentioning some things about the financial standing of my family and how it affected my decision on where I finished my   high school years (I chose the school that offered me a scholarship over the one which I already belong to but did not have a scholarship program available). This is because from the moment I said it, the interviewer put so much emphasis on how doctors don't have a high salary in my country and how expensive the education is. He also alluded to how some of his batchmates went abroad in search for greener pastures instead of serving the country. He kept on asking me if I have any desire for affluent lifestyles even if I already said that my values are not inclined to actions that will enable me to amass wealth. I have a bad feeling because I think he has this idea that because I am not from a priviledged status, I have this desire to achieve it through becoming a doctor.

I also think I have a slim chance of getting in because I did not provide the answer to the question of why I want to become a doctor that was expected. I was pressed for some sort of life-changing anecdotes that made me want to be in the field of medicine, but I really don't have one. Most of my motivation come from small experiences that accumulated and from the reflections and insights I gained from them, and I guess for some, that is not strong enough.

Furthermore, the interviewer asked me if what my plans are if in case I met someone in the future and we built a family. I acknowledge the hardships doctors (male and female) face when starting a family, amd I said I think I can handle it if my future spouse and existing loved ones provide a solid support system. This is because I already saw my mom, who is a teacher, do it. But I was shut down because being a teacher and being a doctor entail different responsibilities. I understand it anyway because I really don't know any doctor enough to get valuable insights from them.

I just feel really scared because I gave up a scholarship offer just so that I would not feel any burden from being accepted in the program. Also, I feel scared of the disappointment (both from myself and others people including family and friends) if I ever don't get in.",27May2019,1

I know I can't do it for the rest of my life but I believe I'm capable of spending at least a year doing so off the funds I have and then continuing off and on. I also, like I'm sure most guys reading this, was friendzoned by a girl I had a crush on. The only problem was I was almost certain I loved this friend. We were best friends and she ended up getting into a relationship. I gave up and found someone else. I was sure I now loved her and had moved on and so I moved a thousand miles away to a different state with my new girlfriend. 


I started to think a lot about the best friend that I'm sure I'm really in love with and realized I wouldn't or couldn't be truly happy thinking about her and being with someone else. It started to make me reconsider my life's purpose and what I should be doing with my life instead of being unhappy. During this time, my best friend had gotten ahold of me and told me she had realized she loved me all along as well and had left her boyfriend. I didn't know what to do and told her that I couldn't do anything now as I had moved so far. She said she didn't know what to do either and she found someone again and now they've been together 3 or so months.


 I couldn't stop thinking about her since then. I don't feel happy with who I'm with now and feel that I can't be if I'm trying to replace her in my life. I decided that I just want to live and enjoy my life as much as I can even if I can't be with her. I've already decided I should leave my current girlfriend because of these feelings and probably not look for anyone else. I'm saving up enough for her to have a couple months rent when I leave.


I hardly own anything. I can fit everything I own inside a box and a backpack. I have my backpack full of everything I would need for a long term hiking/camping trip and everything I consider valuable in a box to be shipped to somewhere safe to store. I plan on just leaving and shipping everything I have and taking everything I need to camp and hike for as long as possible. I'm thinking about basically walking a thousand miles to clear my head. 


This has been one of the more stressful things I've encountered and I'm not sure if I'm handling this well or if it seems like I'm having a mental breakdown. I really just need any kind of outside view and addition input to the situation.",27May2019,1

24,"Driving to another city before the sun came up to get an abortion, we couldn’t help it. There are routines, and checklists for day trips, and talking them over is a way of saying We got this. The dogs would have the neighbours check on them and let them out, and they would message us to let us know how they were doing. Water dishes are full, food is portioned, AC is on. The stairs are blocked off. Can’t come home to another torn ligament on our oldest boy. We have water, prescription weed for pain after the procedure, change for parking, a change of clothes if needed, shoes and flip flops because your feet swell when you get stressed and overheated. A blanket for you, and coffee for me. I checked the tire pressure and fluids under the hood the night before. Sunglasses in case your eyes get red. We are doing the right thing.
The sun comes up over the highway and I check the gas tank and I confirm that we still have about 20 minutes extra allowed for a fill up, and small towns don’t wake up for business this early. I drive around one town and we exercise our skepticism on if the pumps actually work if the station there was actually open. The bathroom around the back of the station, complete with fence hinges to replace standard exterior door hinges that splintered off some time ago. You note that this looks like where people disappear from, and that the ground or floor is always wet in these places for no particular reason. I mention that the dirt looks like chicken fat cooled on the surface of stock. We talk horror movie stuff for a bit before I exit the town and keep on the highway. This is good, these memories and shared recognitions. We still have 15 minutes for an unscheduled stop.
I understand that delays on a commute from road construction are part of the package of infrastructure maintenance and improvement. A bit of a pain now for a benefit later. We didn’t check the highway report, and the last time I was on this highway was for work months ago. Darn it. I do the calculations out loud as you hotspot off my phone to check the report. Four more highway improvement corridors, traffic will be slowed. Four times this extra time for travel- we are good. We allowed for an extra hour for travel for your appointment. We attribute the extra travel time to Nonsense, because there’s always nonsense when travelling.
Outside the hospital, I tell you that I’ll drive around to find somewhere close. Normally I just park at the first spot and walk whatever distance, or I just drive around for a close spot without announcing like an airline pilot. You sigh and tell me to just park and I jump in right after insisting that I’ll find a close spot for you. After a moment I take a breath and I park, and we talk. You ask me how I’m doing and I tell you I’m worried about you. We’ll be ok, you say. And you’re sure you don’t want painkillers for the procedure I ask.
After over a decade of Drs just upping your scripts when the breakthroughs and the higher doses didn’t work for your chronic pain, you said enough. Went through withdrawal for 2 years. I took a pay cut to be home more to help you get through this and live a life, and then got 5 minutes notice to work for 5 months on the road. Life happens, and I need a job. You went through withdrawal then on your own, and with me on the phone, and little input from Drs other than curiosity and caution. And offers to just up your dose for a little while longer, or give you anti nausea pills, or anti psychotics, or anything else to deal with the side effects of gun slinging medications. That’s the routine- hurt your back at basketball and the hydromorphone doesn’t cut it right now? Just take a higher dose. Except that doesn’t work for chronic conditions. It just gets worse. So you said no. It was time to quit and be done with all that. Even when you ended up in the hospital with an acute, unrelated condition, there were Drs who were dismissive of your medical history, your explanation of your symptoms and the likely culprits(which were right), and condescended to ask about brain fog and estrogen levels. We learned after a few other serious emergency room visits(after the withdrawal and unrelated) to not mention the meditation you were doing, or the therapy you were undertaking. Any suggestion of lifestyle beyond quitting smoking turned on the All in Her Head exit sign above the door. I’m not an interrupter because I don’t think interruption makes me right or it’s usually not the right way to attribute importance to words, but I had to interrupt the functional medicine Dr who, on your first visit, after saying she thoroughly examined your file, suggested walking in nature. Look Emerson, here is everything we are doing. I listed everything for a minute, and she tried to cut in, and i put my finger up and I told her I wasn’t done yet, and put my hand on your knee, and you were shaking. Another Dr talking down to you. How do you evaluate effective treatment? Or specific novel modalities? She’s looking into LDN- what’s your experience with this? I asked. She had to reboot. I wasn’t trying to be The Man, just to get the Dr to listen to input. All of this, so many others. You were done with painkillers, I knew, I had to ask.
We met with a med student to fill out the information needed. The confession seeped out. Normally we are very careful, for our own reasons, but we just started having sex again after five years of illness, and she found out she was allergic to latex and she just needed sex that one night to feel sane. Human again after a decade of having no emotional life or capacity to experience pleasure. The med student agreed and offered a few comments. Professional conduct in pressure environments is different but not entirely distinct from the ability to connect with someone in same. One, I feel like I’m being dealt with by someone with aptitude and experience, the other, I checked off my shoulder and could see her laugh and relax. I felt the same. I think the student understood by our interaction that I wasn’t pressuring to have the abortion, and she did ask those types of questions.
I’m going to skip the procedure, except to say that the Drs and nurses involved were present and humane. She had a severe panic attack before the procedure, pale and losing consciousness, and they responded to it better than any other hospital or clinic than she had been treated in before(she wasn’t having second thoughts- she just asked them to get me to help keep her calm).
I don’t really know how to end this, because I don’t want to give any identifying details, for obvious reasons, but I will say that I hope that the quality of care she experienced that day will be present in our health care system one day for everyone. Some of the ills and sufferings of the human body may be discrete, but the production line atmosphere in the health system doesn’t illuminate how they are alleviated.",27May2019,3
25,"Alright guys settle in for a long rant about my unfortunate luck. 

Lately, I’ve been a little stressed with wedding planning (about 4 months out) adjusting to a new job (I am a marriage and family therapist and the paperwork is DEFINITELY the worst part about my career), and getting a new puppy. 

Since it’s Memorial Day weekend and my soon to be husband had the day off,he planned a beautiful day for us and the doggos. We were planning a semi long hike, complete with lunch in the wilderness. What started with an absolutely perfect time, transpired into a day of chaos for me. 

The hike we chose to do was in the mountains and followed a stream the whole way until you get to a little waterfall. The hike is really fun and lovely. You constantly are climbing back and fourth over the steam by jumping on rocks and climbing for fallen trees to get over the water. At the beginning, I told my fiancé “if we don’t end the day with me face planting into a stream today then I’ll count it as a win” as I am typically pretty clumsy. The dogs were having the BEST time. They were jumping around, playing in the water, chasing each other. 

The hike was shorter than we expected and we realized that we needed to climb up some logs, up a running stream, with deep water to get to the end of the trail. At this point we realized that there was no way to do this with 4 legged friends. So, me being me, decided to take a jab at it anyway and have some fun with it while my fiancé watched with the dogs and they played in the stream. I successfully made my way across the Logs and up the stream and was super proud of myself. My fiancé watched me and was like ahh what the hell I'll try it too. He’s coming to meet me at the other end when he steps on a log on one end that I’m at on the other end. My leg slips off and I go crashing down into this FREEZING cold stream with logs all around me. I feel trapped and I’m yelling at my fiancé to help me when I realize that I can stand and walk my way back to the shore. My fiancé is dying laughing, I’m soaking wet, and the dogs are like what the hell is happening. 

Afterwards, I realized I had my iPhone in my pocket. Totally fine right, the new iPhone are alter resistant right? Apparently not because since this all happened, my phone has been glitching out and now won’t even turn on. After we got home and I’m trying to get my phone turned on, I go to grab my laptop from my work back to look up some stuff about the phone. I then realize that my laptop is missing from my bag. After a long time or tracing every step and trying the “find my Mac” feature, we realize that my laptop was stolen from my car sometime in the last 25 hours since I’m an idiot and left my bag in the car overnight. 

While chasing waterfalls was such an amazing and relaxing time, now I am stuck here with no laptop and no phone, both are which are absolutely required to do my job. While it’s stressful right now, I know that myself and my fiancé will (hopefully) one day be able to laugh about it. Life sucks sometimes. Lol.",27May2019,1
26,"**TL;Dr: tried it all, emptiness, guilt and hopelessness driving me to die if I cant come up with a functional realistic plan to change things**

I am male, 23, Canada. Since October 2018, I have been fighting off the strong desire to end my life. I quit my job, I moved home, I tried everything to get better. I exercised, diet, join clubs, opened up to family, self help books, ocassional therapy, got a job again, got accepted to college, etc. The pain wasnt going away, I still had my self hatred problem. I hated myself so much, its my defense and my explanation for everything. I had always been alone, never any friends, it eats away at me, I just lost the new job nos too because I confessed my desire to end my life when Ive never been more serious about doing it. I gave my dad my guns because I read about how incredibly painful it is to your family if you kill yourself and how these people wish their loved ones would have told them so they could have helped, so I told them. 

I went to inpatient of the hospital a month ago. I quit my job, I was assigned a good psychiatriat that actually cares and before pusging any drugs, he performed many tests on me to ensure there isnt something causing the way I feel. MRI, xrays, ultrasounds and more, everything was fine. Ultimately, he says I have a personality disorder and there could be a biological component to my depression. He thinks I need an antidepressant and then therapy and he guarantees I will feel great and productive again in 1 or 2 months. Frankly, I dont believe him or in the ""chemical imbalance"" theory of depression

I honestly believe drugs are more unhelpful long term than they are helpful and have very negative consequences for me. We tried two antidepressants that reacted very badly. Now Im on Effexor 150mg and reacted horribly again but pushed through it, the negative effects went away but now I feel so zombie like and apathetic, I dont physically feel my emotions or feel bad, I just dont care and this scares me. (3 weeks on this drug) On top of this, he prescribed 2.5mg of an antipsychotic Olanzapine which I think will especially mess me up permanently and it terrifies me.

Since 2018, the only reason I have been holding on AT ALL is because I dont want to destroy my generous loving family which is honestly all I care about. I moved away and hadnt really been around them for years, most of my adulthood, so coming back was like seeing them for the first time all over again and it changedy perception. They do so much for me, spend so much money and time on me and love me. But I honestly think my dad is a narcissist, selfish, obnoxious, talks over you, bosses you around, gaslights, manipulates, guilt trips, most of what he does for me is just spend money on me when I dont even need it. My mom is also a bit narcissistic, always makes it about her and makes herself a victim, does not listen to you at all and is so incredibly annoying and also guilt trips me. My sister is also a narcissist and selfish and doesnt listen or care. My other sister is incredibly caring and has so many amzing qualities, I feel great talking to her, shes helpful but I think I am exhausting her and dont want to bother her. 

Anyways, so I can get discharged from the hospital, but what then? I'm now back living in my dads house again. He leaves all of his dirty clothes and dishes everywhere, lawn uncut, all trees and bushes need trimming, garbage all over the house and expects me to clean it and cook. All he does is watch tv and gets upset if I want to talk and turns the volune up. There are moths all in the house and sometimes mice, Im sleeping in the sheets I had in the small bed from when I was a kid. I guess I should get a job, but I already had a perfect summer job lined up but I blew it by being hospitalized. I would maybe try again but I am unmotivated and its too late now when I am going to college at the end of August. Anyone at all that my family knows already told them that I am going away for school, so thats my expectation I dont want to live down, besides if I dont then it means another year of living in my dads moth infested house, cleaning up his messes.  

So I dont feel enough emotions because of these drugs to kill myself over emotions now. But logically I want to die because 1. I cant conceive of a plan on what to do for the next few months to fix my life; 2. I feel so much shame and guilt and I am so awful and selfish and bad and irrepairably so that I want to finally end myself.

Whenever I talk to others, they prefer to talk to others because I make them uncomfortable. My lack of facial expression or genuine emotion or reaction or interest in them. I feel fake, judgemental of everyone. I think I am actually in love with myself and a narcissist and stubbornly want to be a victim and whine about it instead of just moving on. I have never had anyone except a few acquaintances briefly and my family, especially growing up, I spent every recess alone in a corner, bullied, alone and when I went hoke my family just watched TV and my parents yelled at eachother. Since the divorce at age 14, I was hospitalized then too and my life has been an internal hell since, absolute self torturous misery. I am alone with only me and I treat me horribly,  even physically I pour boiling water on myself to punish myself but its not at all enough. I am so selfish and awful, I feel so much guilt for all of the resources I consume, all the love and care I dont reciprocate. I am incredibly stupid, incredibly ugly. I have almost no libido and dont understand my sexuality, virgin and a bdsm weirdo who will never have a partner. I dont even want kids now or a family, what am I sticking around for. 

If I live, I am worried mid college I will have another ""episode"" and ruin it. Or after graduating, I'll get a shitty job with no future or Im not cut out enough to succeed and then Ive really ruined my life. If I am living with family until the end of August, ill be miserable the whole time  I hate this community and wont make friends here or a job, just home alone wasting time, consuming my parents resources. Not even motivated to exercise or anything, I could maybe get therapy for a month or two after being on a waiting list but I cant even afford that. 

The economy is bad and getting worse, so is the housing market, the environment and planet is dying. Most people I meet are so selfish or self absorbed or dumb, society is so hard to connect with now largely because of technology. I dont know why I was brought into existence when I feel so pointless. My parents themselves dont enjoy living, why did they make me. Life feels like a big ponzi scheme where you have children so they can take care of you and it fills your existential void and passes it on. Why am I here and why would I create more life to suffer be part of the ponzi scheme. You just slave away at work and hope you can save enough money to afford old age with all of its painful illnesses physical and mental. 

I am so ashamed and humiliated to be back in the inpatient unit again after almost a decade of travelling the country studying and working. I had 2 good years of not feeling suicidal but still depressed because I had a plan, goals and was achieving something. But now it all seems impossible and my efforts meaningless. Yes, I have hobbies, there are many things in life I enjoy, and I feel ok when I am with family because I stay busy and not alone. But I dont know how to move away again start over in yet another new town, I am scared of being alone and torturing myself again. I dont know if its these drugs or not, but I just feel disconeccted from everything, I dont even feel like my family is my own or my past is my past, I feel like every day is a shitty dream and I just want to be passive in my life but theres pressure for me to improve and fix everything which I only see dying as viable. 

Now that my guns are gone, I regret ratting myself out because now I only have hanging which is harder and I dont even really want to die, its so permanent and hurtful to others. But I cant come up with a real, functional plan to it all. If that is the case, I never asked to be here anyways  I can have this all be over.

Is there anything I can do?",27May2019,2

39,"Sob story/post time. 

I came from an abusive household. I over came so much shit. I fought my demons and won, I managed to accomplish the dream I had thought was impossible. I keep having breakthroughs but I don’t feel satisfied. I don’t know what’s missing. 

Once upon a time I had a great family. During 4th grade my older brother started bullying me during school when I finally got the guts to tell my mom she slapped me and told me how bad of a son I was and proceeded to tell me how I was just jealous of my older brother. 

I had debilitating depression, social anxiety, and selective mutism for the majority of my life. It wasn’t even the betrayal from my mother that caused this. It was what happened after that. My mother turned from the best mother in the world to a disgusting human being over night. Suddenly she didn’t bother showing favoritism, didn’t pass up any and every opportunity to beat me and a shit ton more but it’d take a long time to say it all. Anyway, 

A few times I was so close to suicide. I always told myself “just one more day, tomorrow will be different” it never was different, nothing ever changed. Due to my social anxiety and selective mutism I couldn’t do shit and I was isolated from society. There were a couple of times where my teachers would report me to social services because I always looked so depressed/didn’t talk to anyone. They’d come and talk to me etc. I’d always shake my head saying everything was fine. 2/7x I tired saying shit. They went and talked to my mom and “no he’s lying he’s just looking for attention” and every once of hope I had would be crushed. 

During my senior year of HS I felt something changing the last week of HS. I didn’t feel depressed anymore. I didn’t feel that anxiety anymore. I went on into college and shit changed so much. My shit had disappeared and I got to working on myself. I went from looking like a homeless to turning heads. At this point shit was getting real at home. My parents were kicking me out. 

Some day I realized my dream of enlisting in the marines was possible now and so I did. I had to jump through so many hoops to be able to enlist and I never gave up. One of them was references. I didn’t have anyone to put so I met with my HS teacher I had known for 5 years. Though email, I asked to meet person to person. When I was in front of him he didn’t recognize me, walked right past me. When he turned around he started at me for a few second then “(insert name)!!” By the end of the “meeting” he was like “you talked to me more in the last 15 minutes than in the last 5 years put together. I was speaking fluently instead of the not speaking/ stuttering from being so anxious. 

I enlisted and shipped off to boot camp. I was dropped a couple of times for medical reasons. At some point I thought I wouldn’t graduate and I was terrified, I had nothing to return to. I spoke to the chaplain and he made me see something. He told me “do you realize what’s going on?” I was like “?” He was like “just like you had to jump through a million hoops to enlist you are now jumping through a million hoops to graduate”

Boot ended and here came MCT. I gained a little more social skills but still not at the “normal” stage. A few hours ago I was talking to my roommates (now in MOS school) and I realized something “wow I’m spreading full, fluent sentences without an accent” (I had an accent (English isn’t my first language) even tho I was born here and had always been around English. That’s how much I never spoke since I was little..) 

That’s the end of the story for now. 

Normal kids dream about having superpowers and getting that new toy for Christmas, I dreamt about being normal. I had this “I wish “ list that I knew I would never have/get because the things in that list were the equivalent of becoming a billionaire. 

The list: 

- have a voice 

- be happy 

- be able to interact with people 

- enlist in the marine corps 

- have confidence 

- no anxiety 

- ( this one I haven’t accomplished) 

I never planned to accomplish any of those, it’s why they were on my “I wish” list. They were so far fetched so when I did accomplish them idk what to do after 🤷‍♂️

I accomplished every single thing in that list except for that last one but I don’t feel “satisfied “ don’t get me wrong, em hysterical about what I’ve done but it doesn’t feel right. On my boot camp graduation while I was standing there staring at all the people, at the other now marines, at the drill instructors I was thinking “I earned the title but I don’t feel like a marine” same thing in MCT. I did all the work, climbed mountains, qualified on the rifle range, threw grenades, qualified in mcmat, shot a machine gun, cleared buildings, etc but I don’t feel like I did anything to earn the title. Don’t get me wrong I’m extremely proud of myself. 

In a few years, maybe months I’ll come back and I’ll proudly be able to say I accomplished everything I wanted to. For now though I need new goals cuz I ran out of em.",27May2019,1
40,"Even though I face a lot of anxiety, I don't really feel that I deserve any sympathy from others. I haven't really been faced with any hardships. I've been lucky in life. 

It's easy to compare yourself to others and be disappointed in what you're lacking, but it feels pretty overwhelming when you're the only one that doesn't fit in. The one that's always picked last. This crippling loneliness will be the end of me.

Started out writing this while in a good mood, but it looks like I've already ruined it. Fuck it. Full on depression, here we go.

When I was in my mid-teens I decided that if I didn't find something worth living for by the time I turn 21 I'd kill myself. The age limit was arbitrary, and as I got closer to the date I realized that I wouldn't even have finished my studies at that point. I decided to push it up a couple of years so I had time to experience a little bit of life outside of the school system. I passed that limit last year. I took the decision seriously and I can to the conclusion that even though I haven't found something worth living for I'm too curious about the direction of my life and career to leave just yet. A full year has not yet passed, so I still have the opportunity to do it without going against my word. Will I go through with it? I don't know.

My depression has for the first time in my life gotten so bad that it's getting in the way of my professional life. I can't concentrate on work anymore, and people have started to notice. Not to say that anyone actually cares. I feel like I'm just getting more worn out with age. I need to deal with this before I'm to weak to go through with it.",27May2019,2

44,"Warning ⚠️: emotional. And partially a rant..?

Background info:
At a young age my family spiraled further into dysfunction, physical and emotional abuse from her and men she brought home lasted a long time (a lot of police records can be found). At 15 I gave into lies and cut off contact with my father for three years after a divorce. At 17 I abruptly packed my things (against court order, as presented in a divorce decree. My mother had custody of me.) and went to live with my dad. 

If I did not do this I’m sure I would be dead now, I was suicidal in that house. My mother shamed and berated me over this through social media and text. As soon as I turned 18 I was completely shunned. From extended family and all.

Despite all that, there were times that seemed like she was my friend. Although looking back, I was always walking on eggshells and I seriously thought she knew my every feeling. I was scared of saying things to make her upset because I wanted to be happy with her. There were times where we’d laugh and gossip with each other. I acted like her shield because I loved her and wanted her to be happy. I was her emotional support. I even took extensive care of her when she was sick. I always thought that the parents needed care first so that they were able to function for the family, right??

Nothing I’ve ever said about how I feel has ever mattered. She pretended to listen and did the opposite as soon as I had my back turned. Or sometimes right in front of me. I sucked it up and was always the one who apologized.

She was not always that kind of weird mixture. Long before everything started to go bad, I remember her as a quiet, modest mother. I don’t know what happened. I still remember being sad even at that time. Her father, my grandfather was also a narcissist, so I wonder if this is a case of victim narcissism...?

My situation/question:
I feel loss when I think about her. We both cut each other off. I did it first to take back control, but still gave her opportunities to fix that, change things, and repair the way she’s turned things on me. 

It’s been over a year since I cut her off. She’s shown me she cannot change herself and I’m heartbroken over that. I feel no affirmation and it feels like she’s dead. 

My question is if she’ll ever come around to me again. If not, I’d like to just move on if I can. It’s kind of like yelling down an empty tunnel to see if anyone is there.",27May2019,2
45,"

so I'm currently chilling in bed listening to music. I might have realized why I've been not feeling music quite as much as I used to. It's the unhealthy choices I make in my life outside of music. The countless hours of YouTube, procrastination, taking the shortcuts, me choosing short term pleasures day in and day out, etc.  It drops my energy levels. Procrastination in particular I think is a big culprit. When I procrastinate, I lose confidence in myself because I don't feel like I have control over my self or my life. Instead, some powerful and uncontrollable force does. When I'm always drained or stressed, I can't be in the present moment while playing or listening to music.

 if I feel good in my day to day life, I have the energy in me to be creative and produce music. If I don't procrastinate and instead take control over what I do with my time and discipline myself, i can attain this. I think the greatest artists out there have to be some of the most disciplined people as well. If we want the ability to be like them, I think we have to adopt those habits.

I've lately been trying to experience music, rather than ""listen"" to music. I put on a good pair of headphones, lay in my dark room, and really see what music is all about. I notice that when I experience music, it's not limited to my ears. I am able to visualize the artists ideas, have certain images pop into my head, have a different mood instantly. My sense of spacial awareness kicks in as I listen to the different drum reverbs, all of the creative little touches that give the song life. Shit, I was listening to some Marvin Gaye and I unknowingly started dancing in my bed! 

Ultimately, we need to do things conducive to creating a positive mindset in order to experience and create music which fulfills us.",27May2019,0
46,"Eleven days ago I along with my spouse put down our beloved cat.  She had been struggling with Cancer over the last year, taking a severe toll on her body and immune system.  She has had a number of illnesses and serious health issues over the last seven years that I knew her, but she survived them all until she met the last one at sixteen.

We have four cats and in my life I have been lucky enough to be the guardian of a few more, but she was perfect.  Everything about her; her personality, kindness, gentleness, and selflessness was something we admired.  She didn't have one thing in her we ever got angry with.

I am lucky enough to own my own business which has provided me with a stream of income to spend on her many visits to the vet and different strategies to give her the best quality of life possible before the end of her life.  With being in this line of work I feel alone often.  I work mostly at nights and my days are free time, lately spent assisting my cat with her many needs to live a better life. 

  Multiple small feedings a day, cuddles, supplements, antibiotics, etc and ups and downs in her health which preoccupy my mind.  She should have died five or six times over the years but my love brought her back to good health when the vets said she was done for.

Just a bit over a year ago she sneezed blood in my hands during a cuddle, and over time this evolved into full blown cancer. 

While we did lots of things to postpone death for her, It got to a point where things that had a positive affect had reached their end.  She got sick again and the steady stream of infection and blood streaming from her face was only getting worse.  I was in disbelief as she stopped eating again.  She was already so skinny and her extra strength antibiotics were no longer working. 

I had grown extremely attached to her in my care giving role of keeping her alive and I was in disbelief that this finally her time to go.

After a few days of giving her a chance to make a come back, we called and made the appointment for a home visit 3PM the next day.  I was overwhelmed with grief and sadness.  

I spent almost all of my free time attending to her needs over the years but in understanding that now there was a time and date set, I felt like I never gave her enough.  I've come to terms with it now, but I feel like I still could have given her more.

I spent the next 40 hours spending all of my time with her which sometimes meant just sitting next to her as she struggled to fall in and out of sleep and try not to helicopter over her as she wandered the house for a sun spot or for water she for some reason was licking but not ingesting.  It was the most despair and helpless I have felt.

I stayed with her as her time remaining alive on this plane went from ""18 hours left"" and ticked away until 3, 2, and 1.  

The last few hours did not go as I would have liked. She slept most of it and didn't really seem like she wanted attention or cuddles.

The vet was late, lost in traffic. In taking turns sitting next to my cat and looking out the window for the vet,  our girl got up out of bed for some water.  She was remarkably mobile.  I wasn't sure it was time to let her go. We took turns picking her up, saying goodbye to her, and kissing her wherever we could as we awaited the vet.  

Finally the vet arrived and I put on a brave face as I answered the door.  The vet and the technician went to work quick putting the catheter in our cats arm which caused her some discomfort.  I sat back in shock observing them prepare everything as my spouse held her. 

We said one last goodbye and an ""Ok"" as the vet injected her with a large dose of chemical.  I held her head in my hands and in under three seconds her body went limp. I slowly let go and let her head fall into my girlfriends lap.

I couldn't believe it was over.  It all happened so fast. I cried so hard that nothing came out and my head felt like it was going to explode.  I didn't know what to do.  I wanted to scream but you know, people being there and being judged held me back.

In the few following moments I would open my eyes periodically to look at our sweet baby girl laying lifeless in my spouses legs as we sat on the floor.  No more heavy breathing from the cancerous tumor in her nose and throat.  They say that you should get a feeling that your cat is at peace, but this did not feel like peace to me. 

I rubbed her paws, head, and anywhere I could as I felt overwhelmed with sadness, guilt and hopelessness.

All of a sudden I felt a rush of relief.  I don't know what the relief was about.  Perhaps that this ride of constant care, obsessing over her health, considering my own death in her, wondering if I am doing enough or that perhaps she has some other illness we are wrongfully treating, going to bed worrying about her and waking up immediately wondering if she is dead to go check on her - all that was over.

This window provided enough time for the vet to wrap up our baby in a towel and take her away to be cremated.  Something I regret - my quasi eastern beliefs are that you should stay with the body longer after death as the soul is still in the body.   

As soon as the vet left I immediately was overwhelmed with sadness.  I felt as though life was no longer worth living and this feeling lasted several days, but subsided enough for me to accomplish my daily duties for work.

I wrote out a plan to honor her memory and to never forget her.  Change some bad habits, better my life and help others in her name.

Sadly I can already feel myself forgetting her.  I never thought I would. I can feel myself moving on.  I feel as though I need to stay in my depression longer to give her life and death more meaning.

While looking at old videos and pictures of her before her cancer provide a better insight into how deep her actual illness had gotten before that dreadful day we ended her life, the hole in my heart, the emptiness, and the feeling like our house isn't the same now that she is gone is something that won't go away.  I just am returning back to distracting myself with meaningless things.

What I took away from her passing is that I was not ready for it.  It was far too fast, faster than I thought.  That day did not go as I wanted it to, even though I spent many many great days enjoying her presence.

This feeling will happen again with everyone and even myself one day.

Every single second we spend alive is ticking away.

We spend it doing the most mundane, stupid things.

Every moment of your life is sacred.

Don't waste it. 

The truth of death looking at you in the eyes will let you see it this way.",27May2019,7
50,"Hello everyone, 

I have the long ambition to study about human intelligence, and help create one near perfect AI someday! I am an undergrad and have been working on this for 2years. To achieve this, there are, like in every field, some advanced books on the topic, which the experts in the field themselves wrote or recommended.

I have been planning on reading them from the start of last year! I even bought the book, but never actually started reading it. I am continuing doing the same level stuff which I am already somewhat good at without any further improvements. I know I could improve myself by grasping that theory in the book and then practising more. For some reason, I am holding back myself, and let the book collect dust :(

I am getting tired of myself and my behaviour. I want to change! It’s not like I am busy, I have lots of time, but I spend it on binging something. So, today, I will prepare a schedule to complete the book in these two weeks! I can feel I have been a slump for so long and I am crying and want to get out of this and do at least some minor things towards my path! 

I haven’t figured out what the problem is with me yet, but I don’t want to focus all the time on it. I rather would want to complete this mission, and who knows maybe along the way, I might find the answer to that as well! 

My high priority mission for the next two weeks is completing the book and gaining more advanced insights into the field! I only hope I will be able to update again with positive outcome on this! I have read some good inspiring stories on this sub where people wanted to change themselves, which inspired me to write this post

54,"So for about an year I have this chest discomfort which increases if I press the left rib bone (I can pinpoint the exact area in fact), or am having some extreme emotion or very rarely while exhaling. I do not experience it if I'm working/working out or when I'm just busy with something and it's not that intense that it distracts me. It's just I'm worried if it is related to heart or something serious.

This discomfort sometimes spreads in my left arm as well. 

My routine ECG/blood tests came out to be normal and my physician said it's nothing to worry about, might be some ""random"" pain. 

Should I take a second opinion or is it really nothing to worry about?",27May2019,1

She told me they will be leaving temporarily and I might not be able to get the bottles for a small time. She also checked up on me, asked how much I was, using and brushed on the addiction potential as she would know I'm using recreationally and am likely addicted and trying to ween off. I think she knows Im trying to get clean but she doesn't me to get withdrawal sickness. Its nice to see that she cares enough to try to  do her part without having to refuse service.

56,"I'll start this saying that I've pretty much always dreamt about essentially living in the woods, like Tom Sawyer or something. I know I can't do it for the rest of my life but I believe I'm capable of spending at least a year doing so off the funds I have and then continuing off and on. I also, like I'm sure most guys reading this, was friendzoned by a girl I had a crush on. The only problem was I was almost certain I loved this friend. We were best friends and she ended up getting into a relationship. I gave up and found someone else. I was sure I now loved her and had moved on and so I moved a thousand miles away to a different state with my new girlfriend. 


I started to think a lot about the best friend that I'm sure I'm really in love with and realized I wouldn't or couldn't be truly happy thinking about her and being with someone else. It started to make me reconsider my life's purpose and what I should be doing with my life instead of being unhappy. During this time, my best friend had gotten ahold of me and told me she had realized she loved me all along as well and had left her boyfriend. I didn't know what to do and told her that I couldn't do anything now as I had moved so far. She said she didn't know what to do either and she found someone again and now they've been together 3 or so months.


 I couldn't stop thinking about her since then. I don't feel happy with who I'm with now and feel that I can't be if I'm trying to replace her in my life. I decided that I just want to live and enjoy my life as much as I can even if I can't be with her. I've already decided I should leave my current girlfriend because of these feelings and probably not look for anyone else. I'm saving up enough for her to have a couple months rent when I leave.


I hardly own anything. I can fit everything I own inside a box and a backpack. I have my backpack full of everything I would need for a long term hiking/camping trip and everything I consider valuable in a box to be shipped to somewhere safe to store. I plan on just leaving and shipping everything I have and taking everything I need to camp and hike for as long as possible. I'm thinking about basically walking a thousand miles to clear my head. 


I apologize that this post is so long but this has been one of the more stressful things I've encountered and I'm not sure if I'm handling this well or if it seems like I'm having a mental breakdown. I really just need any kind of outside view and addition input to the situation.",27May2019,3

65,"Way too many of us are limiting our lives by fear, be it fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of being judged, fear of other people's opinion, fear of getting mocked, fear of getting laughed at, or any other kind of fear. Way too many of us are not living our lives to our full potential.

We all have grand dreams, we all want to succeed in every single area of life, make ton of money, be rich, famous etc. but how many of us are getting what we want? Think about it for a moment.

People are afraid of trying something new (or taking action) because they think they might fail. And they think if they fail then others will laugh at them. People are afraid of speaking in public, and interacting with other people. Reason? Fear of being judged by other people. People don't feel comfortable expressing their views and opinion. Reason? Fear of conflict. You see how this works?

Here is the truth, at least my truth: all of us can achieve all our dreams. As humans we are all equal. If one person can do it then every other person absolutely can! There is no rocket science to it.

**Thoughts, thoughts are odd aren't they?** I wonder what will come to my brain while writing this, Peace loving tech monkeys. Thats the ideal state of humanity. 

but is the ideal state of consciousness. or is there something more complex more grand out there. Something that we're  already apart of, yet ironically enough

not aware off. I present to you my C.C Theorem. But we can call it the Collective for the duration of my explanation. Anyways back to the topic of Consciousness.

What is it and where does it come from. Humans have come to understand consciousness is a state of awareness of being or within ones self. Every heard the term

""Do you have a conscience?"" This is primitive. Conscience, or aware of what is right and what is wrong. Right and Wrong is a very humanised opinion. Let me throw you

into a scenario for this. let's say a eons. Humanity has to, obliterate a solar system for a trade route, to ensure that a constant array of supplies is going

to colonial outpost strictly for the cultivation of are species. A utopia, where humans are raised in prime condition. Best living standard. Best education

the universe can offer. Fast forward a few billion years. The absence of the gravitation influx within that solar system, no matter how insignificant or

minor this influx is. Everything has a causality affect. This said galaxy, has now collided with another. which has triggered a chain reaction of events. 

That would cause a mass extinction level event. S Something you can't run from. Something inevitable. Are you thinking Thanos? If so we're vibing. sick.

How far does conscious go though? Hive-minds?, bigger. God (4-10th Dimensional)consciousness)? Bigger. But what could be bigger?

The Collective. The Collective is a Matrix of everything

It transcendes dimensions. It is all. As a human, or even a simple carbon life form. It pretty hard to grasp the grand scale of all this. The universe is 

immeasurable after all, Well for a human being. But take a picture of the cosmic web, compare it to the neurons of a human being. Similar no?

What im proposing is that, all consciousness. No matter how small, or how large. Is all apart of the Collective. Many questions will arise from this 

enlightened assumption, all is one, one is all. We know human awareness provides individuality, and if being a individual being whilst being a appart of 

a more gran one, without even realising. raises the eyebrow of concern. You're bodily functions are proof of this phenomena. You can't control each cell 

individuality, atleast not yet. And yet another question arises. DNA Encodes these cells to play out their roles, or what humans like to call fate. Everything

has a causality effect. God's exist yes. But theyre just a commanding influence for the lesser colective, us. Humanity. But we are still important. Take away 

a chromosome u got down syndrome. 

But what is are role?

Do we have one?

Surely in this vast universe are impact won't really cause much of an effect. But 100 years is far to short to assume we're insignificant in this universe

Honestly humanity hasn't got a clue into which how old the universe is. Heck we don't even know what it is. We know nothing. It isn't right or wrong to assume

these things. Theres just no point. We all play a role. But for this i have to explain spirituality. Death and reincarnation. And one with a half sized brain 

and access to the internet knows what this is by know, if not why the fuck are you reading my theory. You are essentially everyone. There is no such thing as death

Consciousness has an energy. And the laws of thermodynamics state that energy can't be created nor destroyed. To simultaneously experience you're own individual life

alongside, experiencing everything..It's just it's imposible to put into words. atleasat for me im not articulate enough yet. It's just so much information. Imagine it all

Think of ur self as a sensory organ of the universe, How many planets, stars, solar systems. Star clusters. Galaxy's. Galaxy clusters are there. It's just to large.

That is You, that is Me

68,"I spent most of my “school career” wishing I could graduate but now it’s almost the end of junior year and it’s really sinking in how close I am to graduating. I’m seeing these posts on Instagram about people from my graduating class going to prom with seniors (we don’t have junior prom) and it’s jarring. Yesterday, I was looking over my senior portraits that came in and went on the company’s website. The company has pages for the schools they work with and I scrolled through my school’s page and the “student life” photos they had for the years I’ve been in the school. Everyone has changed so much since freshmen year, physically and mentally.  Even in my case, it felt like only yesterday I was an awkward, shy freshmen with no true identity. I’ve grown so much since then and I know there’s still more changes to come but it’s kind of frightening.

On one hand, I want new experiences and more freedom but I’m also scared of growing up. I don’t want to leave this house that I’ve lived in for most of my life. I don’t want to move away from my family for college or work. I don’t want to drift apart from some of my closest friends. I guess I’m just used to this monotonous routine of waking up and going to school and hanging out with friends. 

Now it’s important to note that I’m generally not good with change. I skipped my middle school graduation but I remember crying that day because I wasn’t ready to leave behind middle school. I was completely glossing over the not so good memories and only focusing on the happy ones. Now I’m honestly glad I’m not in middle school anymore and I would never ever want to return to that point of my life. 

Nostalgia also plays a factor, I guess.

78,"This will be the first time I've written these things out.

My first memory was my mom being raped by a serial rapist who broke into my grandmothers home. We lived there because my Mom was a heroin addict. I was five. He held a knife to my neck and told her not to scream. Afterwards no one spoke to me about what had happened. Although later I found out he had raped multiple women in Culver City and he did go to prison. 

Unfortunately the adults in my life had a lot to deal with. I was alone for most of the time even before the rape and have some memories of wondering around the house alone etc. My aunt murdered her boyfriend and killed herself right around the time of my Mother's rape and most of my family had addictions. Then luckily my dad stepped in. He did his best with me until I was 15 despite him being an alcoholic. He was also a member of a Los Angeles punk band but quit playing and went to work at this time to care for me. 

From age 5 to 15 I saw my mother once. To live with her in fifth grade. But she'd leave me at the school waiting for hours, and finally drug dealers broke in and destroyed the apartment. I went back with my dad. 

Because I had so much trauma and discord as a child, I was a handful as a teenager and he kicked me out. I went to where a much younger half sister lived with her father. Unfortunately he preyed upon me. At 16 he raped me multiple times and kept me in his house for two years. I got pregnant but thank God I was able to get myself down the mountain (we lived in Lake Arrowhead) and got an abortion.

To escape my reality during this time I went online. I chatted in chat rooms. I met a wonderful man from Canada. This was before 9/11 so jumping on a bus after the abortion, with all my meager possessions was no issue when crossing the border. We moved into a house with other young people. Unfortunately I got pregnant. I decided to give the baby for adoption but at six months pregnant, gave birth alone in the bathroom at home to a still born baby before the ambulance came. 

Somehow I recovered and a couple years went by. But my boyfriend discovered he had liver cancer. He passed away. I stayed living in this same house with my best friend Jen and at this point started smoking pot. I found a job as a gift store manager. Things went well. 

My brother went missing for ten days in California and turned out he died in a car crash. The crash wasn't easily found. Then my dad died from alcoholism and hep c during this time and that's when I had my first anxiety and panic attacks. I couldn't go across the border because I was afraid I'd be in trouble for my overstay in Canada illegally. Dad was all I had since my mother was always a heroin addict. I still struggled on though and eventually got a hold of my panic attacks. I thought I was going crazy. But I kept going although still smoking pot. 

After living with my best friend Jen  for ten years, she got diagnosed with cancer. In 2010 within nine months she was gone. I lived in the hospital with her everyday. Her cancer was never identified and referred to as carcinoma unknown primary. I continued to survive though and had (and still have never) no hard drug addictions. Just pot. 

I had been an illegal immigrant in Canada this entire time. While caring for Jen, I met a nice man who I married. Four years ago I finally became a real person at 35 years old. I got my first photo id. My first bank account. My permanent residence in Canada.

I found a real job at a local grocery store. Within a year I had been promoted three times. I am a hard worker. However the owner was constantly encouraging unsafe work practices so, with my new found confidence and two years experience under my belt, I quit.

That was a month ago. A week ago I had crippling panic attacks that came in waves after smoking pot. I thought I was dying. I went to the Dr and she gave me 0.5 lorazepam/ativan/klonopin whatever you call it.

Since the panic attacks on Monday which is exactly a week ago today, I stopped smoking marijuana, I quit caffeine and sugar. I'm trying to take as little as possible of the lorazepam. So I take about 1.5mg a day this week. I feel I've lost myself. I'm scared and full of anxiety all the time. Sometimes I think it's finally over, all the trauma is taking over. I have never had counseling, because I've figured I made it this far with no hard drug addictions like my parents. I don't drink. I thought I could do it. But this week has taken me and everything away. Now I'm too full of anxiety to even apply for a new job.

My Dr has an appointment for me to get an ecg and bloodwork just to make sure I'm healthy. 

I guess I'm looking to hear what I'm feeling is normal. I haven't had more panic attacks. But I cry a lot. I don't feel capable of dealing with walking my dog (she's a handful) and in general I'm scared I'll never be the survivor I had become. I am a strong positive person. But now in the last week I feel weak, frail and like I'll be a mess the rest of my life. I'm hoping the feelings I'm having are because it's only been a week, and I've quit marijuana. Sigh. I don't know what I'm looking for. I was this hard working positive survivor. Now I'm this shaky mood swing weakling.",27May2019,2

&amp;#x200B;

but -- though I don't have the conviction to off myself, I'm definitely going through the motions with being alive.

&amp;#x200B;

it's always greener, somewhere, maybe, but I don't know that there's a point. I've heard the religious &amp; nihilistic arguments alike; too skeptical of the former and not committed to the latter, and everything in between is kind of splitting hairs. 

&amp;#x200B;

people might say I have little to complain about, and it's entirely true that on paper, my life is hunky-dory. I succeeded at the things I've set my mind to, through a combination of luck and privilege and sheer stubbornness, and didn't just only follow was expected of me. I'm someone people either want or want to be, for what little good that does. (I've lived both sides of it -- if you're a woman, people don't notice \*anything\* good about you if you're not attractive, but if you are attractive, they take the rest of you less seriously. you can't win.) I don't really have a family legally or by blood, but I have plenty of people I'm grateful for and care for, and people who care about me as well, and vibrant social communities. I'm financially comfortable, if not really enthused about the prospect of continuing to work under the current capitalist framework while things fall apart everywhere else. I'm not alone at all, but I'm still somehow lonely. 

&amp;#x200B;

and I've done all the things that strangers would love to rattle off as advice -- I exercise and eat well. I have hobbies I love. I cultivate my individual passions and preferences. I stay in when I need to, go out when I want to, travel when the fancy strikes me, veg out at home when I should, sleep enough, etc etc etc. I mix things up while still maintaining older commitments. I meet new people and nurture existing ties. It's not all cookie-cutter wholesome living, for those of you who might suggest more offbeat solutions, too -- I revisit psychedelics a couple of times a year, am not too hard on myself or terribly disciplined, and in general I'm pretty flexible. on top of all that, I've had a great therapist for years, have seen a psych on and off; at this point, I'm on no meds &amp; don't have any unexamined trauma. we've been discussing the circular ""not okay with being okay"" phenomenon for months as well, but ultimately there's nothing in particular off-balance with me or my neurotransmitters at this point. there's just not terribly much in my life that I'm attached to. I've been true to myself and I like who I am and what I've become. so I don't know what point there is to this overarching sense of ""...now what?""

&amp;#x200B;

honestly, the only real thing keeping me from pursuing the question of ending things more seriously is that I still have some projects in the works, and the things I would be leaving behind now if I suddenly disappeared aren't creations I would be as proud of as the stuff that's still unfinished/not public yet. 

 

it doesn't keep me from writing suicide notes in my head.

81,"So today was my first official day at work as a junior web-developer.

I got hired by one of the biggest online-shops of my country as part of their initiative to hire some very weak programmers(such as myself) and slowly raise them to the top-tier...or whatever it supposed to be called.

I had prior expirience in web-development, but i must say - writing a small project to learn something is totally different from trying to fix a bug in an enormous project with tens or even hundred thousands lines of code. 

I must admit, it was scary...it still is, tbh, having a task, that you have no idea how to complete. I get that noone is expecting too much of me, but i am still nervous about it. 

So today i wrote about 10 lines of code, that got reviewed and merged into main project...those ten lines took me almost seven hours D: And i think, that it's not good enough for them...

Have you ever felt like that in your workplace? Kinda like an impostor on your own osition? Does it get better with time? Or is this feeling here to stay?",27May2019,10

85,"Hey so I'm trying to type this without crying too much, but a few weeks ago I started thinking about my ex again, when I was in London ( we're from France ), she's been in my head every single fucking day since we broke up 3 months ago and I was fine at first, I always thought it just took time to heal, but it's been worse and worse every day. 

I broke up with her because I was wondering how it was to be single in my own apartment, and I was a bit afraid of commitment. Now I want her back, I asked her mom last Friday if she was seeing someone or if she thought it was a good idea, she said my ex still thinks about me, so I texted her last Saturday ( even though a Redditor advised me not to, unless I was ready to share things and be a real full partner ), she's been so cold with me, she says she needs time to think. 

I feel so lonely, I've always been kinda lonely in my life, there have been good months, and awful years, but for the last 3 months I've felt so lonely all the time. For the last 4 weeks, I've had random mood swings, I'll be happy, and if I think about my ex for just 5min she gets stuck in my head for a few hours and I get so sad.

86,"I know this is a weird topic, but I just need to vent about it. I hate my breasts so much. I plugged my measurements into various calculators and they all said I was a 28DDD or F. But, I don’t have nice round, perky breasts. My areolas are large too, which I’ve heard is unattractive. They don’t look totally flat, but I’m young (almost 19) and I can put 2-3 fingers under them. I don’t even want to know why they’ll be like in 20 years. I thought maybe seeing other women’s breasts would help me feel better about my own. I looked at r/gonewild (probably not the best place to look tbh) and every woman with natural large breasts had perfect round ones. I wanted to die. Then I found r/normalnudes and made a throwaway and posted there. A bunch of weird old porn addicted guys gave me compliments and said they were nice and not saggy, but I don’t care much for the opinions of creepy 50 year old men. I know guys probably get excited about how large my breasts are, then get extremely disappointed when my bra comes off. They tolerate them, but that’s it.

97,"For as long as I remembered, I was always certain I would die alone. I thought I would forever be alone, never find a partner, love. I felt worthless. 

In elementary school I was ""the weird kid"". Same with high school. I was flabby, out of shape, lazy, unmotivated. I didn't have high grades, I had no social life. I never really went to parties because no one asked me. Never mind girls, I was invisible to them. I had one older cousin who was very sociable and he sometimes took me to a party in his apartment. It's where I learned to drink and felt like an actual human being for the first times of my life. But I'd wake up the next day in an empty bed, hangover, still as lonely as before.

College was useless, too. Hopeless. I had very few friends. In elementary school I had one friend, in high school still hung out with that same friend. In college I made one more friend, but him and I drifted apart. I dropped out of college. Twice. Two different studies, each failing within a year or so. I felt like a complete and utter failure.

I just stayed in my house, just lived online essentially. I was a useless online troll. A wikipedia editor. Spent hours upon hours wasting my life away watching series, shows, movies, programs, podcasts, comedy sketches or arguing with people about political bullshit. I worked some dead-end jobs too. Assembly line production, newspaper delivery, dishwasher... I was miserable.

Girls never noticed me. Well one did, in high school. And I fucked it up. She invited me to 'hang out and watch football', and I said 'I will think about it, but I don't like football, so meh' and that's the end of that. Fucking cute girl, too. Hated myself. Spent nights, weeks, months analyzing my conversations, social interactions, and how I fucked them up every time.

Anyway, friendless, lonely stuck at home, working dead end jobs and pissing my life away online... tried some online dating... didn't work. My best friend from college became a successful radio guy. He forgot about me. My best friend from elementary and high school moved to a faraway city. Got into two relationships, both with pretty cute girls, the last one from Sweden and borderline supermodel hot. Invited me to one or two parties... where I was just painfully reminded of my own inadequacy...

At some point I started using chat sites. Just chatting people, random people. Kinda trolling people, messing around, joking around. Made very few legit connections. Until there was this one girl who was very fun to talk to and who, by some miracle, didn't seem bored by me. Even though I insisted she would be... in fact, she insisted SHE was the boring one. The broken and messed up one. I asked for her Skype (this is around 2011) and she reluctantly gave her contact details.

The girl and I started talking a lot. Just chatting, words only. I never showed her my face and she never showed me hers. Not for weeks, not for months. We just talked. She lived in a faraway country. Her studies were kinda failing too, she said and she didn't care much for the subjects she had chosen. I encouraged her to try and study still, so at least one of us wouldn't be an academic failure. So, she tried. I helped her even with her thesis. When she wrote it, she thanked me in it.

Let's call her... Kristine. Now Kristine, she was lonely too. Had few friends, and the friends she did have, were social butterflies with a lot more going on in their lives compared to her. She felt very left out. They all had boyfriends. One of her friends was lesbian and had a long distance girlfriend. All of them had 'someone'. At some point she and I became more and more close. Trusted each other. We came to a point where we wouldn't even care the other thought we were hideous... we would just be hideous together, I guess. So I bit the bullet and called up. Skype rang. Scariest, most nerve-wrecking sound ever.

At first we just did voice calls. She had a very cute voice. Very soft-spoken, clear, a little deep for a girl. She said my voice was 'nice', lol. Add that to the list of things I never heard before. Eventually we went on camera. She was pretty cute right away. Even though she kept pointing out her flaws to me... oily skin, high forehead, big pointed nose, frizzy hair... I didn't care. I think it worked in her favor. I think all the features she had somehow combined formed a nice face. I liked seeing her. I liked hearing her. And she said she felt the same about me. This was something I never thought I would experience in a million years, in a million lifetimes, but I did.

Of course she was extremely insecure and just a few calls didn't erase that insecurity. Both of us never kissed anyone. Never held hands, exchanged anything more than a platonic hug with the opposite gender. Both of us were utterly convinced we were entirely hideous. For a time she tried to push me away... she would tell me to leave. Cry. Make dramas. Make things difficult. She even said I ""could get better"", haha what a joke... I told her as much. Told her I wasn't going anywhere. That it was her or nothing. She even unfriended me once. Blocked me briefly. But she came back, tearful, apologetic. Eventually we admitted that we didn't just liked each other, but loved each other. We were now in a long distance relationship, a concept neither of us believed in. But we were broke. We couldn't meet up yet so we defined it... started writing long letters back and forth.

The letters got longer and longer. Several pages each, word counts of 2000 and up. I'd write them in an hour or less, it was crazy how fast I was, how she inspired me. I felt more and more optimistic, less and less unwanted, less undesired. I knew now that at least one person in the world wanted me...

What terrified me the most was the fact that we met on Omegle. A chat site that connects you to completely random strangers within seconds, and where the smallest glitch in the system can cause you to disconnect with no way of finding back the person you talked to... I could have so easily lost my connection with her, before we exchanged details. I could have so easily lost it, and her, and I would have still been here, as Forever Alone as any of the people here. Instead I got incredibly lucky. Worked my ass off for months for a year... worked five jobs at the same time... saved up... bought a ticket and flew to be with her. Traveled around her country for two months, had a magical time. Met her family, with her father and mother becoming sort of surrogate parents to me as well. It was like a warm bath of acceptance after a lifetime of pretty much nothingness...

I was overeager. Both of us were. So during that first stay there, our first time there, we were like rabbits making up for lost time, making up for all those high school and college years of sexual frustration pent up within us. So she got pregnant. I was terrified but also over the moon with joy because now even if she would leave, well, I would have this permanent reminder that I was once loved. Proposed to her right there and then.

Years have passed. We met in 2011. Now it's 2019 and we have two beautiful children with a third on the way. I was FA. Now I'm pretty normal. Still have social anxiety. Still feel shy, still feel useless, at times. Still feel sad, at times. But most of all, above all else, I feel grateful. And lucky. So damn lucky. And I hope you will be lucky, too. And not give up hope until you get there, especially to the younger people here (25 and below) because really, hard to believe as it may sound, it **can** happen.",27May2019,1

109,"\*\*Is a fetus a baby?\*\*

No, a fetus isn't a baby. It's close, but it's not exactly a baby, in the same way that a Poliwag isn't a Poliwrath. It's close, but not exactly. We're not killing babies, we're preventing one from being born by removing its preexisting state, in the same way that we can ""abort"" a chick by cracking open the egg and removing its contents to make delicious omelettes. You wouldn't call egg yolk a chick, would you? You wouldn't call a sunflower seed a sunflower, would you?

\*\*Is a fetus more important than the woman?\*\* 

When's the last time you saw a fetus pay taxes? When's the last time you saw a fetus work a job? When's the last time you saw a fetus contributing to society in any way? That's right, you haven't, because fetuses don't exactly work jobs, pay taxes, or contribute to their respective societies.

\*\*Is it moral to abort?\*\*

I say morals are overrated, to an extent. Let me ask my own questions in response: Is it moral to tell a woman she can't control her own reproductive cycle? Is it moral to force a woman to have a baby and raise it when she obviously can't for whatever reason? Is it moral to force a child to be born, only to end up potentially living a horrible life in foster care? Is it moral to say that a woman can't have an abortion, and so she has to suffer whatever consequences that may arise from the pregnancy, including risk of death? I think not.

\*\*Look at some of the benefits of abortion:\*\*

 Less poverty, fewer children in the foster care system, lives of women saved when their pregnancy could potentially end in death, and slower population growth, to name a few.

\*\*I firmly believe that people who are against abortion are either anti-woman, pick-and-choose pro-lifers, or hypocritical moral crusaders.\*\*

You know when I'll listen to these clowns? Never. Most of these people most likely couldn't care less about it, and simply pretend to. None of them are losing sleep over the fact that somewhere in the world, at this very moment, an abortion is being performed. Give me a break with this whole moral crusade, because that's what this is, a bunch of self-righteous buffoons (politicians and citizens alike) picking and choosing when they want to adhere to their own sense of morality all for the sake of political or social power, toting their party line, or taking a side in a social issue because it's a hot topic at the moment. 

When's the last time anybody even thought about abortions before our third world country equivalent and excuse of a state, Alabama, decided to go all litigious against abortion rights? We were all too busy focusing on Trump for the past what feels like several presidencies before abortion suddenly came back into the spotlight, and now everyone suddenly has an opinion on it and it's worthy of so much media attention that more important things are going by the wayside or completely ignored altogether.

Humanity will stay its course, even if we allow abortions. Humanity didn't suddenly take a huge step in the wrong direction in our evolution because of Roe v Wade. If anything, it's saved many lives, and prevented a lot of suffering and potential suffering. Our species is just fine, and will be. Abortion isn't going to end our fucking species, but you know what potentially will? Climate change, which is apparently less of an issue than abortion, given how much they deny it and/or ignore it, but they'll talk all day about whether or not a fetus is a baby, it seems. 

We might as well just kill ourselves now and let the earth do what it does best and continue on without us - it'd probably be a lot happier that way, anyway. Where's that meteor with our name on it?",27May2019,0

112,"I got friendzoned... or if that’s even a real thing idk. I’m just sad and confused... knew this girl from high school and we’ve been hanging out a lot over breaks. Really sweet and nice and beautiful... smarter than she thinks she is, and we’re both artists. She’s studying product design and I’m studying aerospace engineering with a minor in art. I actually introduced her into product/industrial design because that’s something I’d like to study after my undergrad, so I felt there was a real connection there. When I was a senior in high school, and she a junior, she even told me I should have asked her to prom. But then she got a boyfriend, and i had been crushing on someone else harder at the time.

See last summer she broke up with her boyfriend, who I had apparently set her up with during a party (didn’t even know I did until she told me) and had also lived right fucking across from me. I set her up with her prior boyfriend too back in high school because she told me she had a crush on him back then and I was really drunk. Anyway, after the breakup she started hanging out with me and would invite me to “draw and watch the sunset” with her, but I had never made a move. She told me she was still getting over her ex twice when I had told her I began crushing on her. Then college started back up. We still talked and she hit me up over winter break and we hung out. I even went to a New Years party with her, but I still didn’t make a move when i had planned. She had ended up DD, and I got really high and drunk and fucked up and nervous, idk what happened. The next night we even hung out at my friend’s place and got close. We had plans to hang out the next two days, so I still had time to make a move in my head. She got sick though, she said, and even let me know in advance she wasn’t feeling well so she doesn’t know if she’d be cool to hang. I had to leave for school again.

Still talked with her tho, even gave her a lil valentines gift... Now school just ended and I had really missed her and thought about her a lot and was really looking forward to hang out again. She came back but had to leave for vacation/family wedding a few days after. I asked her if I could take her on one last official date. “Sure, why not,” she said. I suggested a cool architecture place. She suggested another cool and closer architecture place that had a good hiking spot next to it. “Let’s do it,” I replied. “Bet.” She came back and even invited me over to hang out and drink with a mutual friend and her sister. We got close again, and I even had the chance to walk her home maybe? I’m not sure, but I froze again at the time. I don’t know why I was getting so nervous. I’m a virgin but I’ve kissed girls before so this shouldn’t be that new. 

Anyway, she said before when she was gone she may have work/internship stuff so she may be busy. Ok, that’s cool, but over the next week she seemed more cold and distant and kept pushing the date back and communicating with me less...

Oh no.

I started getting anxious, and this is where I think I went wrong a bit. I kept trying to save it and asking her to hang. Eventually today I texted her and asked her if she was still down for a “little date.” She said “not really” and she only sees me as a friend. :(

So I guess that’s that... Honestly I feel better now that this stupid thing is over and I don’t have to worry about it anymore I guess and I can move on, but it still stings. I guess I waited too long to make a move or she never liked me back in the first place. Just sad and confused.

113,"  

I’m not supposed to struggle. It is not who I am. I have a great job, where I earn a good living. I am a nationally recognized expert in my field of work. I had the perfect childhood, with no trauma or worries whatsoever. I am a father of three wonderful children, and I am in a long-lasting, stable and committed marriage. I have no real anxieties or any issues socializing with people. I would assume people see me as quite successful. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what’s the problem?

&amp;#x200B;

I have never been good at talking about my own issues, and I feel like they are growing out of hand. I live a very a busy life, where finding a good life-work balance is tough. All the emotional labour involved with parenting and trying to be a good spouse doesn’t leave room for me to entertain negative thoughts of my own, and there is certainly no good opportunity to address them.

&amp;#x200B;

I can’t see myself being comfortable with being a burden. Certainly not to my wife, who has a lot on here plate already. I want to be the rock, and rocks don’t waste other people’s time with their own worries.

114,"Need to cheat the system? Money's the ultimate manipulator.

Do you have problems that you need solved? Money is the ultimate solution.

Do you need any favors? Money is the ultimate bargaining chip.

Do you want power? Money is strength.

Money walks, money talks.

Markets, governments, organizations, they all run on money. The sweet taste of revenue and tax dollars is enough to entice any human being to do anything, as long as the decimal is in the right place. Money is the ultimate motivation, while simultaneously the ultimate corrupter.

115,"I saw a post on Instagram today, it  said to mention 3 things I love about myself. I couldn’t. I thought for minutes and the thought has been going through my mind all day. It shouldn’t be this hard. How sad and pathetic is it that a person can’t name 3 things they love about themselves. The sad part is I don’t even care, I don’t want to love myself I mean why would I? I’m worthless and useless. I know it and others know it too. I envy those who are completely infatuated with themselves; that idea seems like a complete fantasy. Where can I sign up. I feel trapped inside my body, inside my mind. “Smoking kills” if only the effects worked faster. I feel like not drinking water is my version of coping with thoughts of death; it’s a form of control. Maybe I subconsciously wanted it this whole time. What normal person purposely becomes deviant; inflicting pain and suffering to themselves and others around them. I’ve had problems all my life and nobody around has cared. I’m done, im a terrible person that’s why. Nothing can change until you come to terms with it. Im disgusted by me and I’m scared for what will happen when I come to terms with who I am. It’s gonna happen sooner or later.",27May2019,3

117,"George W. Bush said that they hated us for our freedom. If this is true, the Islamists scored a huge goal for themselves. Ever since 9/11, we have become a country ripe with paranoia with a sense of false patriotism. The PATRIOT act pretty much gave the Islamists (if this was their goal) the victory that they wanted, and we fed right into their hands.

The NSA has become the most loathed organization, and it's all thanks to the paranoia that another attack like 9/11 can happen at any moment, when in reality, it's a once-in-a-lifetime event, if not even that. There hasn't been a single credible threat or course of action taken by a terrorist group on American soil since. All of these potential terrorists are too busy committing acts of violence in their own countries or European countries while masquerading as refugees and hoping that one day, Sharia law will become the only law that humanity follows, because it's what their ""religion of peace"" dictates.

The PATRIOT act pretty much threw away habeas corpus for so-called ""potential terrorists"" and all the government needs to do now is accuse you of terrorism, and off you go for an all-expense paid vacation to the beautiful island nation of Cuba, locked away in a prison where you have no rights and are held without trial because the United States believes that you're a terrorist.

What is a terrorist anymore? We use the word so incredibly loosely that we'll call school shooters terrorists, even though they don't fit the definition, as most (if not all of them) don't have any political or religious motivations, but no, they're terrorists, because they just are. HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE.

What has 9/11 done for us as a nation? Nothing positive. Trillions of dollars spent on middle eastern wars that are virtually unwinnable. Talk about getting the most bang for your buck.

Where does it all stem from? Our war on terrorism, which was fueled almost exclusively by the day that will live in infamy for the rest of humanity's time, here on this inconspicuous speck of a planet in an infinitely expanding universe that we call Earth.",27May2019,1
118,"I am so sorry I did not use the courtesy flush technique. I really had to go for at least 30 minutes as I drove. It felt so good to relieve myself. It felt like a personal world record of continuous asshole stretching dedication to defecation. I balme the bridal shower from yesterday with unlimited sushi, tapas, desserts, and alcohol. Mix that with  today's 4 cups of iced coffee and a Johnny Rocket's chilli and cheese topped tator tots. Well again 7-11 thank you. I apologize, sincerely for royally clogging your toilet 😣🚽.

121,"Example - Cooking, I like doing it, im not amazing at it, but when I do I enjoy doing it. I just find it pointless to cook for myself. Too much time and effort just for me. At work when we have a potluck I'll bring food I made in and no one believes I made it cause I never bring my own lunch to work.

Example 2: Donating. I donate money or items sometimes and I feel good about it hoping that it helps bring someone happiness if only even temporarily. I'll never ask for money or things when I myself am struggling though.

I feel like this is maybe something that requires a therapist. Does anyone else feel this way about things similar to this?",27May2019,1
122,"I was never someone social, ever since I was a child, I played alone, disliked being touched by my mother.
I went through some unhappy times, my entire life so far, has not been easy, I know life isnt easy for anyone, but it just feels so alone, so.. unhappy.
My mother neglected me, my father went off with another woman, leaving me in a household with a violent drug addicted stepfather, and a mother who didnt care about us at all, except when we were of use.
Meanwhile I was bullied and beaten up by the kids in the neighbourhood.
My father took me in when I was 12, but my stepmother was very controlling and didnt like me, the complete opposite of what I was used to.
Often when school was done, I would go i to the local church and just sleep on one of the benches, so I wouldnt have to go home.
My mother recovered by the time I was 17, my father kicked me out as I didnt want to go to the military, so I moved back to her.
Things seemed alright, but when I was 18 I got ill, for three years I could eat nothing but toast,  on the brink of starving as ai couldnt eat, nobody figured out why, nobody took me seriously.
It turned out I had a rare condition and required a big surgery.
I should be happy, I feel mich better, but the grim reality is, I am not, I wish I was, I feel guilty for not feeling that way.
I have no real friends, and even those that I had, we only met at school for the most part.
Everyone feels so empty, and the family here.. toxic, there is no love for me in this house. At least none that I can feel.
I doubt that even if I would meet more people, I would find someone who would understand me, who could feel me, who I like and am able to love.
It's not like I need someone, I never had and got through, but a wish is a wish.
I have a large plushie, it is the most wonderful feeling getting into bed in the evening, imagining it is someone waiting for me to embrace them, to tell them that I love them, to be gentle with, and tell my fears to. 
The only person that understands me isnt real.",27May2019,5
123,"Okay, so I have a friend, I’ve been friends with her for about 2 years now, and we ended up forming a really really close friendship, and by really close, I mean REALLY close. It started off with her in a vulnerable state, which made me want to help her, so I did. I spent a lot of time helping this friend out back when our friendship began and our friendship kind of grew on the principle of ‘you help me, i help you’.
We were in a larger friend group together from when we got close to about mid 2018. I’ve recently sort of rejoined that group, for them to tell me they think she’s been in love with me the whole time, and they are not the only people to say that. Many people around college who have just met us both also saw the friendship as intense, and a bit romantic on her side. I have a boyfriend, and have never romantically been into her. 
We have a history of arguing, especially in moments of her being highly emotional. But from the start of this year we have been frequently arguing. She is currently going through an emotional time (without particular reasoning) which pushed me away and has put a significant amount of space between us.
The space has made me realise a few things about the friendship. She dislikes it when I have other friends, and constantly attempts to meet me and be with me. She also likes to be physically close, say goodnight, good morning, I love you .etc. She’s been very clear about not wanting me to get a boyfriend. I told her I had a crush on a guy and she told me she didn’t want me to leave her, and when I told her I was getting close to my (now) boyfriend, she said some horrible things and it led to a significant argument, including telling me that if my heart was broken, she would be relieved, as that means I would come back to her. She consistently states she likes helping others, and very much relies on my lack of wellbeing, as she likes to help me. I’ve ignored health issues due to helping her, and as much as that is my fault, she has helped me indulge in self destructive behaviours, and has witnessed me doing so, without telling me to stop. She likes to control small elements of my life also, dictating when we meet, even if it isn’t ideal for me. She is hyper specific on what she wants me to do, telling me what colour my bedroom light should be when she is over, how much eye contact I should make, and how I naturally react to her jokes. 
The distance has done us both well but she is recently becoming very questioning on why I have stopped saying i love you and partaking in other routines we used to have. Her mental health is going downhill again and she has taken me away from my friends to cry on my shoulder, as she used to do every day. I don’t feel as connected to her as before, and when we go out it’s okay, when alcohol is involved, but usually there isn’t the same feeling as beforehand.
This friendship hasn’t really done me well mentally and socially, and as I am coming back from before and being more forward and honest with her I’m not sure what to do. Many people have said I should leave her, but I feel they will be biased, as they see how she treats me first hand.
So reddit, what do I do?

TL;DR: Friend who is very protective, and potentially in love with me. What do I do?",27May2019,5

127,"When we as a species can't think of anything important to discuss, we turn our attention to trivial things that aren't of any real importance. Transgenderism is one of these things.

The whole Sex vs Gender debate is just silly. Sure, they're both separate, but they're also used interchangeably. From what I gather, Sex is biological, while Gender is social. Makes sense. Gender is used to describe masculine vs feminine, while Sex is male vs female. OK, sure, that's easy enough to understand, and seems to be backed up with how we define those words.

OK, debate over.

Oh wait, now onto trans rights.

Sure, everybody deserves equal rights, because we're all equally as human as one another, no matter our race, ethnicity, sexuality, whatever...

OK, debate over.

Oh, wait, there's more?

Transgender people should be allowed to use the bathroom that they...

OK, fine. I honestly don't care. The only reason I go into a public bathroom is to do my business and get out. I couldn't care less if there was a man, woman, or human centipede in there with me.

Sex changes...

Yeah, I wouldn't ever get one, but if you want to, go ahead. I'm not going to stop you.

Is a transwoman an actual woman, a transman an actual man...

I DON'T FUCKING CARE. Call yourself whatever you want. It literally has no impact on my life AT ALL. Just leave me the hell alone...

OK, let's get technical.

No, your biological sex cannot be changed. If you're born a man, you're a man until you die. If you want to transition to appear as a woman and go through the whole process of doing so, then sure, I'll call you a woman as a show of respect. I don't have a problem with it.
