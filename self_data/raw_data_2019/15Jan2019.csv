What has it gotten me? Unemployed, poor as fuck, depression, no confidence at all (very low that I've never signed up for any dating sites with profile pic.) And a virgin at 26 years old. (not ugly nor hot, average looking)  


All that because I'm always too nice, hell I got rejected by a girl couple years ago because guess what? Im too nice and too kind.

Today after some couple friends rejected to help me with a small thing because they were ''busy'' I'm done.

3,"Today I was out shoveling our driveway, when the snow plow came through our cul-de-sac. The plow always ends up making huge piles of snow that completely locks in any cars parked on the street, so me and my dad quickly moved all 3 of the cars back into the driveway. My moms car was parked in front of my dads, separated by about a foot on our semi-steep driveway, and I am standing in between them, clearing out some snow. All of a sudden, my leg is caught between two SUV’s. My mom’s parked car slipped down because of ice and I was my left leg was lodged between her car and my dad’s. I screamed out in pain to my dad, who was luckily still outside, and he ran over to his car and was able to move it within like 30-45 seconds. It fucking hurt so bad, and I couldn’t move an inch, I was worried I was going to lose my leg or something. As soon as he moved his car back I fell to the ground in pain/fear. It turned out to be completely fine, and I am just a bit sore - but holy shit. I thought my life was going to change in a matter of seconds. Phew",15Jan2019,1

Not even socks on.

""I'm---I'm naked!"" as his bare ghost-white bubble butt turned in panic, shaking in fear behind him haha.

I said ""sorry!"" and of course exited quickly.

7,"So I rarely feel bad, to be honest I rarely feel anything, I’m numb. I know what I’m supposed to feel in every situation, and I tell people that I “feel” the corresponding feeling, but really I don’t, I’m just good at acting. It’s gotten really boring, everyone is so predictable, and nothing exciting ever happens, considering that I’m only 17, I wonder, is that normal?

10,"So I was just going through and getting rid of stuff in my bedroom and behind my dresser in my closet I found my old diary and I immediately recognized it I wrote in this diary for two years 8-9 years old.And I just sat down and read every page of my old diary and honestly it was scary because i wrote down all my thoughts in this diary during the two worst years of my life.And i came across this one day in it which was 2 pages long.And before i share what i wrote i think i need to explain some context.My mother left me when i was 4 and my whole child hood i hoped and hoped and truly believed that she would come back but in this 2 years i was getting older and was starting to realize that hey maybe she doesn't love me like she said she did.And during this time it was hard without a mother also my dad drank and smoked alot and he was severly depressed about my mother and he hated his job.We were very broke so no new school supplies or new clothes or shoes.Top Roman every night.I was getting severly bullied in school.My parents never really spent much time with me for example they never really taught me to speak i just picked it up from other people and TV so as a result i had a severe speech impediment it was a main reason why i got bullied so much.In school i went to speech therapy and the other kids knew about it I was embarrassed.And always got told that i wasn't trying hard enough but the truth was that i really was trying to speak clearer.Also during this time it was found out that i had some eyesight problems.But we couldn't afford health care or a specialist or a another eye docter visit.So i suffered in school not being able to read the board even in the very front row.Also during this time we found out that my grandma was dying of cancer and I was very close to my grandma she was like my mother since I didn't really have one.Also in this i got split up from my step sister and basically all my family from my moms side when when left and I barely ever got to see them so that was rough also.So that is the context before i share what i wrote keep in mind that I was just a little kid when i wrote this.(i am word for word typing this)

-Dear diary, the rest two weeks left of school.And no homework.But im not happy at all.When my dad explain Ariahs big outburst it got me thinking.I don't know what to feel angry because the world took my mommy away.And now the world taking away a person I love the most of all.My grandma.I felt i have a special bond.Or sad that mommy cares more about everything then me.And sad that my grandma is dying of cancer.Its not fair.But I guess life isn't fair.Its so hard to see someone I love dieing slowly.She might not die but the odds are against me.All those little problems in the past seem like nothing compared to this.Its like a tiny flee compared to a big elephant.Doesn't seem right to even compare.All my emotions are just building up.I wish i could go back in time.Where thing were great.Like when my grandma was swinging with me.Now she can barely get up.It's just a mess of emotions.That you dont understand until this happened to you.I miss everyone.And i feel so horrid when I take it out on other people.They don't deserve it.I just want to curl up and die.This pain stings and burns and hurts.Is there a god im sometimes think?Who am I.What is my meaning of life.I just doubt everything.I hear voices in my head.I need help.Im so lonely but im not alone.Every day im surrounded with people.Im scared the worlds dieing.My mom and dad should be together and my grandma shouldn't be dieing.When you die where do you go.Is your mind still working.Are you baby again.Has god made a error I can see people I dont know in my head.Maybe next time he won't make that error.Im just so sad.My heart is sinking slowly.Soon I won't have one.Im scared of hurting my self I think of killing myself.I want someone to talk to who understands.But I dont want anyone to know.Then I'll be alienated and get treated differently.Every thing in my mind is so quiet sometimes i catch myself not speaking but speaking in my mind to myself.

    Ok then at the bottom I drew a picture of a person looking sad.I feel sad reading this and thinking of how lonely I was i wish I could go back in tell and give myself a hug and tell myself that its going to be ok.But also when I was little I wondered all the time why my mom would leave me and I just wanted to know so badly but honestly I still cant understand why she left but now im not im more at peace with it.I don't know, what do you guys think of what I wrote? if you want i could share another page of what I wrote in this diary.Its just weird because I remember being sad alot and crying in my closet and crying myself to sleep.Tucking myself into bed and holding my stuff animal, pretending that it was my mom.And I remember all these things but didn't really remember how I really felt about or what my thoughts were.Turns out they were scary dark thoughts.I just cant imagine a little girl feeling this sad but I was this sad.What are your guys thoughts on this?",15Jan2019,1
11,"If it's a day off, no problem.

If I work 4-5 hours after I get up, no problem.

If I have to be at work within an hour of getting up, I dream about being late, I dream about being in houses that are clearly not mine but I don't notice until I wake up, where I can't find my keys or clothes or whatever. I dream that my car was so iced over it took me half an hour to clear it and then I couldn't get in. I dream that I got to work like normal just fine but was somehow two hours late. I dream that my alarm didn't go off. I dream that I dreamed that my alarm didn't go off and in the dream I wake up to check my phone and make sure it has an alarm and then I wake up for real and do that for real.

12,"The topic of teeth came up from somewhere and my friend mentioned that ‘usually you have your teeth go slightly over another but they’re supposed to meet perfectly, mine already do’
And then my other friend mentioned she got braces to fix her overbite. 

And now I realize that I’ve had an overbite my entire life and I don’t know how common that is. It’s not a tiny amount but I’ve never noticed that it looks weird.. 
I do have a lot of jaw tension lately and I’ve gotten in the habit that if my jaw is fully closed I need to relax it. I don’t know what the difference is between closing your jaw fully and clenching your teeth. If I relax my jaw, my front teeth rest on top of each other, but the rest of my teeth don’t touch. 

I feel really self conscious about my teeth and smile right now and I wish I’d just never been a part of the conversation (ignorance is bliss, right?).

That’s simply not true. You will be okay. Ground yourself with something pleasant like a warm bath, hug from a loved one or sit down with a good book. Doing something pleasant seems to break up the bad... even a little. Most importantly... BREATHE. 
You are a powerful machine. Worthy for the good times and strong enough to navigate the bad times. Re-read this as often as you need to: “It’s a bad time, not a bad life.” 
You have a right to feel this way. You have a right to feel overwhelmed. You’re not silly or stupid or weak for being down. You will rise again and make it harder for Life to take you down next time :)

I need to be better than at least someone, otherwise I feel like shit when I'm at the bottom. I've hoped around from one hobby to another my entire life. I always choose the easiest route, which is why I break my back doing physical labor. My broken body is my badge of honor because nobody else has done what I've done. Nobody else can endure the long, grueling hours, bent over, suffering, like I have. It makes me feel tough.

It's what I had to prove to this world, and now I don't know what to do with that. It holds no merit. It just shows that I was the biggest idiot. Too stupid to get anything else done. I barely managed a 3 year community college diploma. I was too stupid to get through university. Can't remember or learn anything, really. I just get little bits of information, but never been able to say I was well versed in anything. Just a fucking dummy. Same with friends and socializing: if I don't have an immediate connection with someone, I give up on them. This dude seems geeky? Fuck that I don't want to be associated with a geek. This person whines too much? Not my problem, see ya. Too much of a jock? Nope not gonna associate with that. I judge people like I judge myself. And now, I'm lonely. I have no friends. I've pushed most friends and family because I think I'm superior to them, either morally, intellectually, or whatever reason.

I've always been negative like this. I don't know why. My father was hard on me, very demanding. Mom supported me and always looked on the bright side, when I'd get frustrated doing homework as a kid, or trying to build things. She always helped. But dad was tough. He had a different way of teaching. I don't know what it is, but his hard, judgemental voice resides deep within me now. It feels permanent. And the funny part is that he supports and appreciates everything I do now. He's great with me. I know I can change, but this will be tough.",15Jan2019,1

In 2011 I found a journal-type of book In a local hotel I had to go for my dads work meeting. I was actually lost king for my retainer and i accidentally stumbled upon this handwritten book (which apparently is in French) and was written between 2003-2009.
It took Me so long in order to translate this by myself not knowing the language and seriously... it’s just so interesting i guess? (Identity crisis, sexuality, some weird blog screenshots etc)
Well I would like to publish it and make it a book without revealing any personal stuff ofc. I will ofc
Say it is not my work etc.
Also there are some personal pics I don’t want to use. Now I was thinking on going to a subreddit and ask if anyone would be willing to pose for a cover (I would credit them for it)
I just don’t know if it’s a good idea. I don’t want to be seen as creepy or anything. I just don’t know anyone who could pose/not an I a photographer. Sigh

I don’t care what he does, i accepted his fate, 
but when u make the whole family feel uncomfortable of how ur acting and yelling, now i have a problem. taking pills wasn’t the problem, it was now i’m concerned that he is gonna hurt someone. He would never hurt his family, but when shit like this happens and he trips the fuck out, he’s not my brother thinking. It’s always in the back of my mind, the thought that i might have to hurt my brother if he can’t calm down. It sucks to see my family always stressed about my him. I see the Lies he says right to their faces, and it’s sad to see that he still tries. 28 years old and he still lies and thinks we can’t see it. 

From my stand point i’m not a parent so i don’t know what i would do. My mom unbelievably loves us, and she can’t kick him out. I’m not a parent, i can’t imagine how much pain that would be to kick out ur own child, but she can’t do it. and truth is, without my mom, my brother will die.

30,"I’ve been a nail biter my entire life. In the last few months I finally decided that I would never bite my nails again! 
A little background: I normally didn’t bite my nails in public because I found it gross (ironic, because I did it at home anyways) and felt like everyone would be watching me if I did it, however, I used to be picked on in school when I painted my nails because my hands are what you call “baby hands”: short and chubby. I would go to school with nail polish on thinking heck yeah I feel so pretty and good and then the person who bullied me would always HAVE to point out that I have tiny chubby hands and get a group of her friends in on it. I finally decided I would just stop wearing it since I hated drawing any attention I got from that whole group. It ruined my already nonexistent self-esteem. I stopped being myself and didn’t wear makeup, stopped wearing my hair up, started dressing in duller clothing to prevent any attention that could come from them. (They wouldn’t just pick on me for my nails, it was anything they could get a good laugh out of like shirts I wore, makeup, hair style, absolutely anything)
Recently though, I started using nail polish again. I would see the work I did to my hands and have pride in it, and I thought I could do more if I just didn’t bite my nails. I put on a really bad tasting top coat and every time I got the urge to bite my nails, I removed the nail polish and repaint in a different color.

33,"I'm 29, have had measles and Chicken pox when I was a child and got vaccinated against those two including Shingles later in life. Never thought I'd get this at my age despite the vaccines.

Day 1 

Woke up okay and even cleaned the house. By noon, I experienced a  really bad headache that is usually my symptom for a fever. Took paracetamol and slept it off. 

Day 2

Headache is still there and lasted for the whole day. Got worse in the afternoon. Got home from work and had mild fever. Took another paracetamol thinking it's just fatigue from work. Also my throat hurts. My fever broke quickly but I noticed these red blisters appear on my stomach. Put a reminder on my calendar to visit the doctor first thing in the morning. 

Day 3

I took some benadryl in case I get itchy but I couldn't sleep well. My anxiety is kicking in that I might get terrible scarring on my face. Woke up after a few hours of sleep, no fever but my throat is still hurts. Checked my body again. The blisters multiplied by a few on my back. Nothing worse because it didn't itch at all. I got one on my neck, behind my ear and one on my armpit. I also got 3 flat red spots on my right arm. Went to the doctor and he confirmed that it is indeed Chicken Pox. He said i probably didn't have it much worse when I was kid so I didn't develop any immunity to it and despite getting vaccines, on some rare cases, you still get it and yep I'm one of the few unlucky people that got it. He gave me Acyclovir to be taken for 7 days, 5 times a day and L-Lysine and Vitamin C to boost my immunity. 

He also asked me to use Dr. Kaufman Soap or an antiseptic solution to wash my body when I take a bath and apply Betadine or Iodine Povidone for the open wounds. I just finisjed my bath and I feel refreshed. Hoping that this clears out fast since I have to go back to work
 Any additional tips you can give me? Worried the most about the scarring. Also do I need to change sheets and blankets everyday? I don't really feel like moving or doing anything at all while I'm sick with this stupid virus. To add, the doctor told me to ask my Psych if I'm allowed to take my anxiety meds while I'm on medication for chicken pox. Ugh

In November, I was laid off as my company missed sales targets and they decided to downgrade my role with a less senior hire. To be fair, my boss gave me a secret 30 days heads up so I was able to line multiple offers up quickly. 

Top offer was $160k + bonus (definitely above my market value due to a strong fit). And I decide to go the startup route and make half, but was working on an interesting product. Less than 30 days later, I get a complaint from a couple of coworkers who said I wasn’t a good cultural fit and too corporate. What? Because I hold weekly 1:1s with my staff and give constructive feedback (1 negative feedback for the other 5 praises)? One thing about me though is I’m passionate about my work, so I admit that I may have challenged my peers but from what I thought was a healthy debate type of way.

Anyway, my boss fired me today. No warning. Not one feedback before this. On our second 1:1, which was only to fire me.

All I can think about is my wife, who supported me and never made a mention of all the cash I left on the table. I feel like I disappointed her, all because I wanted to go through another startup experience. I’ve been working on my own company on nights and weekends and want to pursue it full time now.... but I won’t. She deserves more than that.

I’m an older executive level manager. I feel like a kid right now, though. I’ll be fine. Just feel like I disappointed a lot of people. ",15Jan2019,1
37,"Erm, where do I talk about writing erotica? Surely not here, of course, I mean it breaks the spirit of the rules, but I was out and about writing some (really weird) horny stories just now based on my wild imagination, and I have no real outlet for it to maybe help em out with fully visualizing it or something...?

I'm fairly certain I saw an NSFW Writing Prompts sub and I want to go there for some input, or at least a place where I can just yap about how I wanna bang and all the weird shit I want to see happen while doing the deed.

43,"4 years ago my boyfriend was engaged to you. You proposed to him, at a beach while on a trip with your family. You invited him. You met him by going over to him, and telling him you had overheard his conversation. It was more interesting than the one you were having with your friends. He told me he wanted to have kids with you. You couldn't have kids but you looked into surrogacy. He hasn't felt safe like that since. 

The day he found out you were cheating he did so by trying to get a hold of you. He needed you. His dad was having open heart surgery and he found out his mom had cancer that day. You weren't where you said you were going to be. You lied, involved your cousin, and when he called her to find you it was so humiliating. She was pissed off too. When he tracked you down you called him a stalker. Your cousin left a note on your car. 

I was only around for one conversation. He didn't get a chance to speak. You were too busy screaming. 

I didn't trust him at first so after a few months I hacked into his email. I found a porn addiction he'll never admit to, but more importantly, letters to you. Begging. Pleading. Trying desperately to apologize for something he hadn't done. He still blames it on the change in your meds, but I also have mental illness. You were in control of your actions in some amount. No amount of illness could cause that without it coming from a place down deep inside you. You could have switched your meds back. He brought it to your attention several times and you used to listen to him.

His gaming took over his life. The house is still unfinished. He's been waiting on his dad. Mailing things, getting groceries, bandaging his feet. When I found him, I was broken too. We bonded over the agony of deep rejection and loneliness. We sat in the silence together, but there was music playing. 

I got him several gifts. I got him clothes. I didn't judge him for gaming. I know it was to numb the pain. I know it was for dopamine. I asked him about himself and he was suprised. Turns out the most personal gifts he'd ever received before were : t-shirts, 1 inkpen,  2 mugs, and a tie. You have no idea how humbling it is for a pipe to touch someone so deeply. It broke, and I got him another. That one broke 2 days ago I will be getting him another one shortly. I don't think he loves me. I don't think he knows me. I just know right now he needs me, and we are both ok with that.

At 12:33am I walked into the room with headphones on. I saw his face. I knew what was going on immediately. He just got the phone call that his mom is down to moments. There is no way he can be there. They are both glad that he won't remember her the most in agony. This is the echo of the moment so long ago when he called you. I am holding him. We are drinking coffee in silence, and he is switching between League of Legends and Evony.

He needed you, but he's here with me. I've been with him over 3 years in limbo, waiting for this moment. You aren't even thinking of him. You used him, and now he's using me. At least we understand each other's humanity. He's so fragile, but he won't admit your betrayal shattered him completely. It's hard to believe you were so selfish you couldn't see that his heart has been broken, entirely. I hope that moment was the best fuck of your life because that's the only good thing I can see coming from it.

44,"So for the past now three days I have been going through a loophole from hell in my head all because of the situation in my head.
What else is new. 
None the less, the one person who makes me uncontrollably happy has completely blocked me off from all communication as of right now and is telling me (in as little words possible) “it’s not you it’s me” and letting me fester in what that means without giving me much more to go off of. 
Without the knowledge of what is wrong or how that person handles situations, besides I guess putting up MASSIVE WALLS, I am now stuck alone. 
I fear being alone because it means I am stuck with my own thoughts which are not and never have been pleasant. 
Which makes me depressed and anxious. 
Which makes me sleepy and not want to wake up. 
Which makes me more depressed and anxious. 
And so on and so one with other little random thoughts and problems added in there. 
All because of one little wrench thrown into the cogs that are the human brain. 
So what do I do to distract myself?
Smoke some CBD, read self help books that realistically probably don’t do much besides just distract me until they make me tired enough to fall asleep, work, eat, and sleep. 
It’s the little things that set me off, but I know people view me as “strong” I wonder if it would affect them any to know how horribly wrong they were?",15Jan2019,1

48,"I have a friend online who just started taking up GED courses and about to do it for the next four months. He's 25 years old, comes from a poor family and he lives in Gulfport, Mississippi. So he told me about how the GED course wants their students to be clean from having weed in their system. However, he has been taking it (weed) as a medicine for his mental illness; schizophrenia. He had the illness at a young age and every medicine from every doctor he met didn't work. And weed was the only thing that worked to get him cope with his illness. It's been a year since we're together and this GED is the only chance he can get to let him have an education which he couldn't have when he was a kid due to the dysfunctional &amp; poor family upbringing during that age. An education which lets him get a job to sustain himself and be independent and overall, improve his living standard. He is currently taking welding course which the GED provides on top of the GED itself. He plans to work as a welder once he get his GED. 

But the current problem is how is he going to get through the GED without being medicated and in this case his medication is weed? Despite the substance he use is considered illegal in the state that he lives in now, but at this point it acts as a medicine in his case. I really want to help him but I can't think of any ideas to do so. Is there anything he can do about it? I would appreciate any suggestions as soon as possible. ",15Jan2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

I know you feel lonely. I know you feel blue. At times you may feel sad and on your own, at times you think nobody cares about you. I'm not telling you to trust easily, but please don't give your heart completely. Because sometimes, people mistake comfortability and infatuation as true love and deep affection. Guard your heart not because plenty will fool you. But because when they break it, They leave the pieces scattered and expect the fixing and restoration is on you. You might feel like waiting feels like forever but i promise you, the true, the right one for you is worth the years you've shed and waited for. Please do not settle for less. Just to feel like you're not being left in the race, please do not give in and say yes. Wait patiently for the one that would make you feel valued. The one that would walk the extra mile just to see you smile. Learn to know your worth so you stop giving people discount. There is nothing wrong with you. I know it because i am you. It's not your loss that they don't see your worth and your hue. It's on them. So please stop giving your self a beating. You are beautiful and loved by many because you are simply, you. Please do not beg for anyone to love you. Do not settle for someone who would keep on taking you for granted. You have a low self-esteem and the least of all the things you need right now is someone who does not see your worth, who does not see your value. You are lovely (i hope you see and realize that) and many might not see it now, but i know. Someone will. Not maybe sooner than you pray for and hope. But there is and patiently wait is all you have to do.

60,"I was sexually abused by a priest when I was 12 years old. I had told him in church that I really loved God and Jesus and wanted to be a priest, so he offered to teach me about the bible, and coming from a deeply religious family my parents were happy to take me to his house on Sunday afternoons once he had finished with church and returned home, and they had agreed to pick me up in the evening.  
“I’m happy that you’re interested in becoming a priest, but it seems that you’ve forgotten your bible.” He says  
“I’m sorry, Father Murphy, I thought we were going to share one.”  
“I suppose we can do that.”, he says, so I move from the arm chair and I sit down on the couch beside him  
“Can you see the words ok?” he asks  
“Not really.” I say, as I playfully sneak under his arm to sit on his lap “Now I can see perfectly.”  
“I’m not sure this is ok.” He says, a bit flustered  
“I used to sit on my dad’s lap while he would read to me all the time, I guess you don’t have kids so you wouldn’t know, but it’s totally normal.” I say  
“You don’t think you’re too old for that?” he asks  
“We don’t really have a choice, do we?” I joke, laughing nonchalantly  
“If you insist. The passage I wanted to talk about was a very important one, it is the last supper. Matthew 26:13 to 30. It is the foundation of the role of a priest, to give people communion, and you must understand why it is so important.” He says  
“Well, father, I am very aware of the importance of communion, but there is one verse from Matthew 26 that I have questions about.” I say  
“I would be glad to help you understand. It is wonderful that you have come to me with questions prepared on the first day.” He says, delighted  
“Well in Matthew 26:47 to 50, there is a scene where Judas actually kisses Jesus, and Jesus willingly kisses Judas back, he doesn’t resist even though they are both boys.” I say  
“That is a good question, it was normal for that to happen back then, it was just a friendly gesture, like a handshake is today. I’m sure you know how Italians kiss each other, and it’s not any different than that, just a friendly gesture. I know it can seem confusing, but it’s not immoral like what you are thinking.” He says  
“Thanks for clearing that up for me father. My dad told me the same thing, but I wanted to hear it from somebody who actually knows what they’re talking about.” I say  
“I’m glad I could help clear things up for you.” He says, as I spin around on his lap  
“Now that you’ve told me, I keep asking myself what would Jesus do? And all I can think about is one thing.” I say, looking him in the eyes sincerely and lean in to kiss him, he draws back, but the couch prevents him as I creep foreward to kiss him softly, trying to part his tense lips with my tongue, failing to do so, but sucking on his lower lip as I draw away, almost exceeding the time limit on a friendly kiss  
“Why would you do something like that?” he asks, taken aback and at a loss for words  
“You said it was just a friendly gesture, like a handshake, and I just wanted to thank you for letting me study the bible with you. Did I do it wrong?” I ask, innocently  
“Well, I don’t know if there is a right way to do it.” He says, completely confused  
“But you just said it was normal, that Jesus would do it all the time, and Jesus isn’t going to do anything wrong, is he?” I ask  
“Well, no, of course not, but it’s not an appropriate thing to do today in the slightest.” He says  
“How can we walk in the ways of the Christ when we condemn his actions? That would be like condemning somebody for praying or going to church on Sunday.” I say, hurt by his heresy  
“I am not condemning Jesus Christ, or any of his actions, including kissing a man, or however many he might have kissed. I just don’t know exactly how that works, or what a good kiss is between men or a bad kiss is, I don’t know anything about kissing, so I don’t want to do anything that might anger the lord.” He says  
“Well, we can always find out for ourselves, just let me know if it feels good or bad, ok?” I say before I kiss him softly again, rubbing my ass into his crotch slowly, horror in his eyes as his cock slowly starts to get harder against his will  
“Was that a good kiss?” I ask, playfully  
“I don’t know, I can’t condemn Jesus but I don’t know anything about kissing.” He says  
“I’ll try again, I’m sure you will know in your heart when we do it right.” I say, kissing him seductively once again, placing my hand on his chest, increasing the speed of my ass against his crotch, prying his mouth open with my tongue to caress his tongue, his mind in a state of shock, paralyzed by fright, I massage his tongue with my own, both of our cocks entirely erect at this point, easily feeling the pressure of the other’s through our summertime gym shorts, he slowly begins to give in, perhaps enticed by the taste of my breath mint, and begins to slowly stroke my tongue with his own, entirely nervous, confused by everything, questioning his choice to become a priest, with his mind now aware of the pleasures of compassionate human contact his body begins lashing out from his painful loneliness after so many years of being a priest, to enthralled by the sheer pleasure of intimate human contact that his instinctive libido overpowers any semblance of piety that may have caused him to shy away, this pleasure is liberating, emancipation from a lifetime of incarceration  
My mouth slides down to his neck, and I slip my hand into his shorts to grab his member, “You know how we should love our neighbor as ourselves?” I ask  
“What? Yes?” he says completely confused, face red-hot with embarrassment, to confused to think, to tempted and to pleasured to stop himself, well, stop me specifically  
“Well, I know that every boy including myself does this sort of thing to themselves, and they love it, so I think I should love you, my neighbor, as I do myself.” I say, kissing him on the neck once more as I pull my own throbbing dick out of my pants, and place the base of my smaller shaft against his own, his massive cock towering over mine  
“Oh good God.” He gasps, his mind choking on thoughts as he grabs his painfully erect penis any my own as he is staring at the celling, frightened, and starts squeezing tight and rubbing frantically fast  
I put my other arm around his neck and pull his head down to look at me, “I don’t want it fast, I want you to last” I say, kissing him once more, “Just let me do all of the work” I say, as I wink and give him a seductive smile, and I go back to setting the painfully teasing pace I enjoy so much. I grab his hand and place it back on our cocks, and begin to life his shirt off, revealing a withered frame, inclined to neither eating nor exercise, but normal enough, looking himself like an adolescent boy before they start to put on muscles, this makes me more comfortable with my own body, feeling a deep connection to him knowing that we have the same body type, I slide his pants off under my legs, moving somewhat like a break-dancer as I spin in his lap to kick my own shorts off, his body visibly lacking body hair as much as my own save for some sparse scatterings of long thin hair along the inner parts of his ghost white thighs.  
“Why are you doing this?” he asks, confused, about himself, his faith, his sexuality, and me more than anything else  
“We are all naked in the eyes of the lord.” I say, as I go back to kissing him, this time he returns my affection with more passion than before, a tighter grip on our dicks but still stroking them slowly as I kiss him passionately which he graciously returns. I take my head back for a moment and stare into his eyes deviantly, he smiles, ashamed of himself but happy. I smile back, and hock a nice loogie into my hand rubbing it onto my already sweaty asshole and then on the glans of his penis. I slide up to position his cock for entry into my rectum, but I can only get the tip in before it slips out as my ass is still too tight. I spit on my hand once again and put the tips of four fingers into my asshole, forcing them in as deep as they could, even spreading them open just in the hopes that I can fit even just the massive head of his ungodly dick inside of my rectum which felt as if it were truly insane the level to which it was thirsty for dick. I did one final stretch with my fingers before I quickly pull them out, and slip the tip of his dick inside the rapidly closing gape of my asshole, but it’s just in time for his swollen head to make it past the sphincter, and his eyes grew wide as not just the tip, but the entire glans was now inside of my asshole, I start to pant slightly, the feeling of penetration was so intense and serene that my body loses all tension, and this allows his dick to slowly slip deeper and deeper inside of me. I begin to work at his cock, riding up and down, making tiny bits of progress with each repetition before finally his dick was completely inside of me, and as the final inch began to be felt in parts of my body that had never experience anything so pleasurable, I grab his limp arms and place his hands under my ass, which he softly fondles as I slide up and down his dick, I wrap my arms around his neck for more leverage and begin to ride him sensually, starting to kiss him one again, my body thirsty for every bit of pent up passion he was reluctant to unleash upon me, the pleasure starts to overpower his mind as his disposition changes from one of shock to shameless eagerness, the analgesia of the pleasure making him indifferent to the self-loathing that was coursing through his mind, I start to tire, breathing heavily, and he gladly starts to take control easily pushing the weight of my petite body up and own on his cock, the thrusts slower but harder, his hips slamming into his ass as he groans, as if in pain, as if he needs to cum but simply cannot, as if he doesn’t even understand how that would work or even what cumming is at all, but he fucks me harder none the less, the pain completely incapable of overpowering this pleasure, I let out gasping moans as my back starts to hurt from such a vigorous assault upon my ass, sending shockwaves through my spinal cord every time this frustrated man fucks me with decades worth of rage, hatred, passion, and lust  
“I need you on top.” I cry, attempting to pull him on top of me, which he gladly obliges, laying me down on the couch and fucking me in the only position he ever had fathomed before that day, his form was shoddy but his effort was superb, in a plank on top of me, my arms still around him, kissing him once again as he passionately fucks me, no longer with the aggressive strokes, but with those of genuine passion, truly making love to me, as if the simplicity of the missionary position convinced him that was he was doing was somehow ok, his arms give out in a short period of time due to a lack of athleticism, and at that point he is simply laying directly on top of me pushing with his legs from the other arm rest of the couch, my cock rubbing against his flat yet soft belly with each stroke, each one bringing me closer and closer to cumming, he becomes more frantic his moans more pained, his body exhausted but his dick still throbbing in sadomasochistic pain, almost crying, drenched with sweat, the sweet smell of his body and the taste of his lips, of the sweat on his neck, and the constant rubbing of my cock between my pubis and his abs was enough to send me over the edge, into paradise, as I cum harder than I ever have in my life, my entire rectum squeezes and stokes his dick inward similar to an esophagus, but only hungry for cum, as if in a futile attempt to make him cum, even the muscles beyond my control inside of my body begin to gratefully stroke his dick, a thick copious stream of semen shoots from my youthful cock and sprays all over my belly, as I moan euphorically, aftershocks of semen flowing freely from my cock, each thrust pushing more and more out of my penis, no longer an eruption but a steady flow dripping from my still throbbing cock  
“Thank you, father” I gasp softly, red in the face, my body quivering and twitching from such a powerful orgasm  
“How do you do that? With your penis?” He asked, serious, confused, in pain  
“Cum? You just kind of squeeze your butthole or something.” I say softly, he does it, thrusting his dick as deep as possible when he does so  
“Oh my God.” He gasps as he releases an unimaginably large load deep inside of my rectum, stroke after stroke, he seems to cum forever, I feel repeated powerful jets of semen burst from the tip of his penis, he groans in fearful pain of giving birth to such a massive ejaculation through his unseasoned vas deferens and urethra as the profound pleasure as this unfamiliar feeling overtakes him, his own body begins to shake as he still keeps thrusting, ejaculating every last drop of semen inside of my asshole, and he keeps thrusting as his dick slowly gets softer and softer, and he keeps squeezing his butthole, so profoundly relieved by the release of that unthinkable pressure from inside of his cock  
“That was amazing.” He says, out of breath, as he keeps rubbing his soft dick against my perineum and by balls, kissing me lightly, politely, a simple friendly nonromantic gesture  
“You’re not done yet.” I say seductively, with a wry smile on my face  
“What do you mean?” He asks  
“Put me back on top.” I say, as I try to budge him, but can’t, he rolls me over and puts me on top of him while I squeeze my asshole tight with all of my might  
“Now what?” he asks  
“You’ve got to suck your cum out of me, hold it in your mouth, then put me back on the bottom and kiss me, letting me drink your cum out of your mouth.” I say  
“Really?” he asks  
“Yeah, that’s the rule. That’s my prize for all of this, so you better not swallow.” I say, as I slide up his body and place my asshole on top of his mouth, resting my small flaccid cock on his face, he begins to suckle my anus as I begin to push a massive amount of cum out of my asshole, his sucking doing more to get the job done than my tired muscles, my gaping asshole giving him all the assistance he needs, his mouth can’t even hold all of the cum as the last drops of thick semen start to drip slowly down the side of his mouth, I lick them up and swallow them, he closes his mouth, quickly puts me on the bottom and playfully drips a small stream of his delicious semen into my mouth which I lovingly lick from his lips and swallow, finally happy to get what I really wanted, I drink every last drop, and lick every corner of his mouth just to enjoy the taste once all of it is gone  
“Thank you, father.” I say sweetly, kissing him gratefully, before laying on the couch exhausted and sweaty  
“I’m exhausted.” He says  
“I think we could both use a nap right now.” I say playfully, as I pull the blanket over our naked bodies that had been draped on the couch the entire time, I spend the rest of the evening cuddling him, listening to his sweet breath as he sleeps in my arms, feeling as if this is heaven that church always wanted to teach us about  
I had fallen asleep when his phone rang, waking us both up, he was somewhat startled but his recent sexual conquest gave him a peculiar sense of confidence and swagger that he seldom exhibited in church save for at casual social functions. The heavenly nap also played a part in endowing him the pleasant tone of the people pleaser he is known to be. He gets off of me, still naked, and goes to pick up the phone, as I gaze longingly upon the body that just made such sweet love to me. He talks, laughing nonchalantly for a moment before saying goodbye.  
“That was your parents; they’re on their way to pick you up.” He says, somewhat embarrassed by what he had done but so thoroughly pleasured as not to care  
“All righty.” I said, getting up and quickly slipping my summer clothes back on as he does the same  
“I had fun today.” I said cutely  
“Yeah…” he says, distantly  
“Same time next week?” I ask playfully, wrapping my arms around his hips  
“Ok.” He says, still somewhat in disbelief as to what had happened  
“We have like 10 minutes before my parents get here, so maybe we should talk about the bible a little bit, just so I can reference some kind of lesson or another.” I say, with reluctant prudence  
“You’re right, that is probably something we should do.” He says, so I take him by the hand, sit him on the couch and sit on his lap, and he starts to teach me about the bible, completely disconnected from any stance other than an objective viewpoint, teaching me the bible not out of faith, not anymore, at least not right now, doing so with diligence as to give himself some confidence that nobody would be suspicious as to what had happened that day. Nobody ever was, and it went on like this for 6 years.  
This is the backstory to me being sexually abused, because the real abuse doesn’t happen until I graduate from high school at the end of the summer, and I am about to go to college in order to become a priest, and he tells me that he doesn’t think we can carry on the way we do, it’s only an hour away, but I don’t have a car, and it doesn’t make sense for me to be coming home every weekend in college, people would become suspicious, and the fact that he put paranoid self-preservation above me, above my feelings, above us, and our love, is the part that abused me, the part that tore a hole in my heart that made me want to die, that made me think I was a disgusting, loathsome, abomination, that I was a worthless and vulgar creature who could invest my heart into somebody just to have them throw it away as if it meant nothing, as it I were a piece of garbage, just a dead fucking raccoon to put your dick inside of and then leave when you got bored with it, I spend every night freshman year in college, and every Sunday was the worst pain imaginable, but eventually I got over it, volunteering at a local youth group helped me find the support I needed, and I eventually became a fully ordained priest, and now I spread the word of God and the love of God to the youth, just as that man had done for me in my youth. I write this now, because after 8 years in practice, I am at a point in my life where this pain is becoming all to real again, not because I am being hurt by anyone, but because I am about to hurt somebody in the same way that almost killed me so many years ago. I’m sorry, Tommy, but we can’t go on like this forever. I know this hurts, but remember that things will get better, they always get better, just never lose faith, and never for a minute let yourself believe that I don’t love you with every ounce of passion and love in my body. I love you Tommy, and that is why I have to set you free.

63,"So for the second time in the past 2 years I fell head over heels for a girl... that I work with... that's in a LTR...

I don't understand why I do this, both of these girls were way out of my league and they were just being ""work nice"" to me, but in my stupidity I imagined more and let my heart lead my head again. 

So now, for the second time, I've violated someone's trust and friendship because I'm an idiot and only think about myself.

I feel like a terrible, selfish person undeserving of being appreciated or loved. I feel like I'm doomed to just let my heart lead and disappoint over and over again in the same fashion.

68,"My boyfriend is a wonderful guy and person in general. It’s obvious that I’m not good enough for him. We were together for 3 perfect years, gave each other our virginities. For some stupid reason I started being curious about other guys. I wondered if there was someone better for me out there and I felt like I was missing out. I started being kind of a bitch to him because I was checked-out. :( 

I met a guy I felt very attracted to and broke up with my boyfriend immediately.  The guy and I began a sexual relationship which soon turned romantic. It crashed and burned (something I honestly expected) and I was filled with regret. In a messed up way, it took being with a different guy to realize that my boyfriend really was the one for me. 

I knew I didn’t have the right, but I reached out to my boyfriend. I cried profusely and apologized and begged him to take me back because I really was an idiot. He told me that I ripped his heart in two so he would need time. I agreed and said I would give him all the time he needed. He called me back the next day and said he loved me, forgave me and wanted to be back together. I was ecstatic and promised to never hurt him again. 

Things were great until I realized something really fucking fucked up: I couldn’t stop thinking about the other guy. I kept mentally comparing them and my poor boyfriend kept coming up short. It got to the sick point where I didn’t even want him to kiss me because it just wasn’t the same. Obviously I didn’t act like this, I tried my best to show him love, but internally I was in conflict .

I’m breaking up with him today. Again. I have no choice. I can’t believe I’m this much of an idiot. He gave me a second chance and I’m blowing it in the worst way. There’s no way that he would even want to be in the same room with me after this, much less stay friends.

69,"Lately I've been less busy at my workplace since I always end up finishing early, so I decided it was time to look for some entertainment. I've liked anime since a while ago, so I tried some manga, light novels and visual novels while I was still at college. I remembered some of those were good but couldn't really recall them, so I tried to read some of them again and oh boy. 

I became so hooked in those I haven't been playing games (which is what I used to do at home in my free time). Now all I do is just sit down and read for hours and hours while listening to relaxing music (specially nice game soundtracks). It's weird because even though anime is supposed to convey the story in a simplified way, the complexity of written media had more of an effect in me that I thought it would. 

Anyways, I finally realized why I enjoy it so much, or rather than enjoy it, why I can't stop reading. The different stories, scenarios, character development and interactions, have all made me look into myself and helped me look at things from a different perspective. 

Be it empathy for the characters or something else, this is a hobby I've really come to enjoy, and at the same time I believe it is making me broaden my perspective and grow as a person. It has also helped me vent up some feelings, specially since I'm kind of bad at expressing myself.

I never considered myself a bookworm or anything, but I guess it was because I hadn't found anything that would catch my attention.

My advice is to look for entertainment in other places or ways you haven't tried out yourself. Depending on what you're looking for, you might be in for a new hobby that changes your lifestyle. ",15Jan2019,1
72,"I was ghosted by a friend whom I thought would always be by my side. I felt we had a great connection and understood one another. I expressed my feelings for this person and I was left disappointed. It hurt and I felt used so I told her that our friendship was pointless if it wasn't going anywhere. After this she told me that I didn't value her. Which was upsetting to hear because that was how I felt. I tried to make things better but I was completely ghosted from all forms of communication. I chose to forget and move on but the pain won't go away. Some days are really bad and I just lay in bed in tears.

Maybe it's my Fault for giving her too much power.

I feel I'm a bad person for letting go of a good friendships because I wanted to develop a deeper relationship. On the other had I feel we are both better of not being friends mainly because a I couldn't control how I felt around her and she had no real intrest in me.

I'm I a bad person? I feel like I am. It's sad but I still miss her.

My class is really small and there's only 7 people, I could feel each person's eyes on me and the my entire body began to shake. I could tell people noticed, but I kept my voice level and tried to say my words with conviction, crack a couple jokes here and there and keep things going smoothly. It worked, but my body wouldn't stop! The paper in my hand shook like a leaf... so embarrassing. I didn't think to put it on a stand and read from it that way. When I finished I felt like I could cry. I was so proud of my material and I had fucked it up. When I sat down I told the friend next to me that I get the shakes every time I present and that it wasn't from nerves but just something my body does (true) in hopes that my other classmates would hear it and understand and not judge me. This is definitely going to haunt my dreams for the next few weeks. ",15Jan2019,1

83,"My mom is a huge radical Christian- she’ll deny it a million times over, but my siblings and I came to the conclusion that, well, she is. Don’t get me wrong, she’s a good person with a very kind heart, but is fully devoted to Jesus and God and all that bible stuff. It feels as though she’s constantly pushing that onto me. I’ve tried time and time again to understand her religious views, she’s always lecturing me on god and giving me religious journals and books, but the truth is, I’m not religious whatsoever and I do not believe in god. 
Moving onto my main point, I’m 18, I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year and yes, we’re sexually active. I was recently in urgent care with her in the room as well when discussing antibiotics for a UTI. Procedure calls for a pregnancy test before you go on antibiotics for a UTI. I was cool with it, no big deal, but when the nurse left the room, my mom began hounding me about not needing the pregnancy test because I’m not sexually active. I am. I would have told her by now if she wasn’t so against it. I don’t know what to do because I feel like I can’t be honest with her about my lifestyle because it’ll always be wrong in her eyes. So now the physicians believe I’m not sexually active when in reality, I am! How do I tell her that I am without her seeing me as a disappointment? 
Also, her radical views seem to be creating a division in our relationship. She’s big on conspiracies, anti government and antivax, the whole shabang. She’s constantly lecturing me on these things and I cant confess to her that I disagree with her without her becoming upset or disappointed in me. Help! ",15Jan2019,1

Even my mom told me if u ever go to western countries never tell them about ur country just lie about it , and as u can see I don’t even dare posting this with my main reddit account , this is fresh new account to post this , and because of how we are shown as immigrants poor subhumans even in my own country people started stripping from their religion just because they can’t stand  all of this bullshit towards us .

And last time I tried to vent and have conversation with western people and why do they have to treat me as human garbage because of my different thoughts that I didn’t harm anyone with , they insulted me and even encouraged the racism towards me .

Yes I should be confident and never look at what people say about you , but the constant mental pressure will eventually get you .

I happened to have paused for thought in the middle of an email while standing a little too close to a speaker... and didn't notice my phone picked up some lyrics... and I just kept on dictating. After my brief pause to think, I said ""new paragraph"", kept talking a few more parahraphs, and ultimately sent off the email... a group email to 5 people, discussing some deal points.

87,"I've always been interested in jury duty ever since doing mock trials in high school, and have had summons before but it was always just calling in for a week and not having to go to the courthouse. I finally was told to come in yesterday and was alright with it up until I got told to go to a court room after lunch.

The name on the docket was recognizable. I had done some fact gathering for a news site and before that for my local community college. Somewhere along the lines I had gotten facts to help report on a crime a little over a year ago, and this case was for that. After lunch had happened they picked 15 or so people to be in the jury box out of the 60 or so of us and the rest sat on the other side of the bar. I wasn't picked but the judge had asked questions that he wanted us to write the answers to in order to save time for when we come up.

Well, this morning was my time to come up to replace one of the people who was excused, and one of the questions was ""have you heard or seen anything about this case"". I answered to the best of my ability without tainting the jury and the judge just said okay and continued asking questions, followed by questions from prosecution. Then the defense asked general questions to us as a whole, followed by prosecution. Prosecution ended up asking questions to individual people to follow up on things said, and she finally came to me and asked if I'd be able to serve impartially without bias and with what I knew I said that without saying on one side or the other I wouldn't be. Questions were asked to others after, followed by a break and then upon re-entry to the court room myself and one other person was excused.

Now, I get that by being honest I was able to help provide a more fair trial to both the defendant and the people of the state, but it still kind of sucks. I finally get picked for a trial, and it has to be one I'm not eligible for.

I thought it would be a cute Christmas present to get my girlfriend custom socks with a picture of her adorable dog on them, so I found this website myphotosocks, that you can upload a picture of your loved one (or mans best friend) and they'll put the picture on the socks. Sounds great right? Wrong. 

This is by far the worst experience I've ever had from an online retailer. It took them 50 days from the time I ordered to the time it was delivered. 50. Days. Mind you, I ordered well before the holiday season rush so I wasn't expecting any issues with my order and yet it was everything but this. The first problem is they don't have a phone number on their website to call for support or to follow up on your order, so you need to use a general purpose email address. Not only was response time slower than turtle walking fast, they falsely promised, multiple times, that my order would be received within ""2-3 business days."" And, I caught them lying to me when they claimed the shipping company was responsible for the delay, which is completely false because the company didn't even receive the package to ship. After many back and forths and more false promises, I disputed the charges with my credit card company because I didn't receive the order and I thought it was a scam at this point. Magically, after doing this, everything arrived lickety split. Completely unacceptable and very unprofessional. I would not recommend this company to anyone. I hope this helps some folks who are thinking about ordering from this website.

104,"My girlfriend has a job right now that has a very toxic environment and I can tell it's beginning to hurt her mental health and cause her to be depressed. She has been interviewing for jobs online but hasn't received call backs really, which has been discouraging to her. Every week she practically breaks down to me from the stresses of the people in her workplace. She is under the mindset that she is 'stuck' at her job and will never get out.

Every time she gets turned down for a job, she takes it personally and I try to encourage her that it's not personal and she simply needs to keep trying but it really takes a toll on her. I continue to try to encourage her but I can tell she's really starting to believe she is hopeless.

She just received a phone call today to interview with a much better company. I am extremely happy for her to get this call but cannot help but worry if this job doesn't work out she will plummet deeper into a mindset that she is in fact stuck and become extremely depressed and discouraged.

I will always continue to encourage her but it only goes so far now and I hate to see her feel this way because I see so much potential in her if she would just continue to apply places. She applies at one a week maybe and I suggested she really needs to do more.

Side note: we have our own apartments. I personally did not want to live together until we are married so this makes things harder because she is forced to work somewhere she hates to pay for her apartment/expenses. I want to help her and could support us both so she could quit and find another job but I just feel that is a big commitment before marriage (personally). Is this selfish of me and is there anything I can do to help support her if this goes south?
