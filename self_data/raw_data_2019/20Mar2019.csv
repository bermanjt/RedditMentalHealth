0,"Less than a year ago, I was the one doing coursework and sitting down for exams in my final year of university. Now I’m suddenly the one handing them out. I’m a first time ESL teacher (I did a one month course in October and got this job in January), and my two adult groups are having mid-course tests this week. Next week, my two teen groups are having their exams. I have no prior experience with exams from a teacher perspective and my course didn’t cover exams, so I’m really feeling dropped in at the deep end. I’ve pretty much decided teaching is not my calling in life, but it’s a decent way of getting some experience and saving a small amount of money. That aside, do want these students to do well, and it’s certainly stressful experiencing kids acting like they don’t care that they have exams in a week from a teacher’s perspective. Honestly, there’s a whole lot to this job that my course didn’t prepare me for (like giving classes to young people in general), and I knew that was going to be the case, but knowing doesn’t make it any easier. The world of work also doesn’t leave too much room for pursuing my ambitions either, but I suppose that’s to be expected too. Welcome to the world of work, I guess.",20Mar2019,6

3,"Someone reminded you where you were a year ago and it freaked you out a bit.

A year ago you were sleeping in hotel rooms or a friend's couch. You had barely any money, you were uncomfortable at your job, you just found out your living parent was a narcissist. 
You worked from the bottom up... Disconnecting from an unloving family even though it was hard, learning to trust yourself and your friends. You battled an eating disorder, depression, and panic attacks.

I know you wanted to end it, I know your plan, I know you felt like noone would care, like everyone would be better off.

I'm glad you didn't give up. I'm glad you decided that you don't have to serve a male God. You found your own goddess, you found yourself, you found a hope.

You drove 80 miles alone, last year you couldn't drive three blocks without crying. You saw a concert and didn't wonder what others were thinking of you. You stood naked in front of an art class and didn't wonder why they would want to draw an ugly body. Your favorite band will have a new album soon. 

There are so many more things coming up that you have no idea about. If you ever feel like giving up again, remember how strong you are. Remember that there will always be something new and that nothing is permanent.

I can't wait to see you travel, I can't wait to see you be there for someone the way your friends were for you. I can't wait for you to meet a puppy that likes the ocean as much as you do.

It's all a butterfly effect. Maybe you'll die and noone will remember your name...but maybe your smile made someone else smile and hold on one more day and that's just as beautiful.

If anyone is going through a rough patch or knows someone that is, I'm sorry. There is something out there worth living for. Try everything you can, even if it scares you. You might hate some of it, but you might like some of it, too. You'll never know unless you try. ",20Mar2019,4
4,"I realized that being subscribed to all these porn accounts was making me view porn x100 more that what I regularly would. I was really starting to feel almost desensitized to all of it and porn started becoming a regular by-the-hour viewing routine every day for me. 

Lemme just say that my feed feels so much better and my mind feels a lot more clean and healthy. I feel more productive and fresh and all around just more happy. 

Now, will I view porn here and there still sometimes? Yeah occasionally. But I think a really good goal for myself is honestly to just cut out porn altogether. I feel that it could greatly benefit my mind and how productive and intellectual I can be.

9,"Yesterday, someone on r/getdisciplined invited people to join him on waking up early and I’ve been meaning to do it forever so I thought maybe I could make a decent effort if I had someone to do it with, so to speak.

Usually, I go to sleep between 2:30-5am, 2:30am being what I’d consider an early night and don’t wake up until 10-12ish and by the time I actually get up out of bed, it’s most likely the afternoon. It’s not ideal especially bc there is other stuff I *should* be doing but I don’t have the will to prioritize it over sleep.

The time I spend in bed (in slumber) is the best part of my day. I look forward to it when I wake up and every moment until then is honestly a moment caught between the now and the night. But I’m trying to want for a lifestyle that is superior to the one I lead now and I believe that bc I spend so much time oversleeping and in a daze because I oversleep so much, that I’m already feeling defeated by the thought of whatever work I tell myself I should focus on and just give up entirely. That happened today. I had a whole day that I pretty much wasted in bed.

I slept 12 1/2 hours last night and while that isn’t uncommon, I felt particularly drowsy when I woke up and I know that’s out of the ordinary bc I usually don’t take melatonin to help me sleep. I just wanted to take it to help me go to sleep hours before I normally would even think to close my eyes. Point is, I’m trying this again tonight, and I have my alarm set for 6am.

I had a best friend  who moved away when I was 9.  We were the same age and did everything together for most of my life up until that point.

21,"This is my first post, forgive me for the length. (TLDR at the bottom)

&amp;#x200B;

Just a few days ago, a friend, that I worked with, reconnected with me and started recounting his life from when he quit.  Keep in mind that he was 18 when he quit and is now 19.

His parents were very poor towards him and taught him a twisted version of reality.  His mother taught him how to hang himself and his dad would take him with him on illegal drug sales.

He has been arrested several times on illegally possessing tobacco related products (cigarettes/vapes), theft, and hiding a wanted person, ironically, this all started on the day of his graduation.  He has even been accused of rape and murder.  He has attempted suicide several times and has several mental issues.

He has since moved far away to live with his current girlfriend and has lost several jobs over the course of the year, his family members have disowned him, and has burned every relationship he has ever had.  He claims that I am one of his only close friends from this side of town.

Since jail, he's gotten several jail tattoos and piercings, but that's not important.  He's associated himself with a local gang that's been decimated by murder, suicide, homicide, and etc.  He's gotten involved with doing hardcore drugs, he even offered me to partake!

I find myself getting scared at this point.  It's been two days and he has called in for favors to drive up an hour to grab him and take him home, then drive home, the idiot doesn't have a driver's license, no money, and no job.  What topped the cake was that he wanted me to rescue a friend of his that had committed a crime and that had a warrant out on their head.  The worst part is that my uncle is the local sheriff and his son is also a police officer.

&amp;#x200B;

No D, I will not do these favors JUST to come and see you.

&amp;#x200B;

I love the man, he hasn't had much positivity in his life, but I don't know what to do about this.  I'm finding his drama very unnecessary.

22,"Hey guys so I've been having this thought for a while (usually at night) and I think it'd be pretty interesting to possibly document. 

Just to note - I don't have a high sense of self esteem to the point where I'm a dick  but I'd say I'm pretty normal, no low self esteem but of course I get certain doubts and at times care too much about what other people think. Also I'm 17 years old. 

I was thinking about shaving off everything. My eyebrows and going skinhead. I feel like if I did this it'd be a pretty interesting. Aside from destroying my self image for my self, it'd also be interesting to see how differently people will treat me first hand. This would really be a kick of getting outside my comfort zone.

But I stayed. From the time I was 18, to when I was 20, (I’m 21 now) I stayed with a boy who made me feel like nothing. 

But that’s a story for another day. And believe me it’s a long one. 

And today. Today I come home everyday to the man I love, who I know one day I’ll get to call him my husband. Who treats me with the utmost respect, respect i never even thought I deserved. He’ll surprise me with flowers, on the most random days at the most random times. He’ll tell me he loves me in the middle of talking about something completely different. He makes me feel like I’m a human being. Like I’m actually worth something.

42,"Every grade I had been bullied in, but getting to middle school was the worst.  I can't even find a seat on the bus. No one would let me sit with them. Either the driver would have to yell at someone to move their bag, or I'd be allowed to sit in the back 2 seats that were supposed to be empty.

After a week of this, my mom decided she'd just bring me to school and pick me up everyday, except she had work late. School got out around 3:30 and my mom didn't get done at work until 5:30. The school would not let me stay that late, so I'd walk a couple blocks every weekday to the public library and read books for 2 hours even though I just lived a 7 minute car ride away from school. All because no one would let me sit with them. This was in the 90s, too, so cell phones weren't really a thing to spend hours on.

I remember feeling so bored and browsing the sections to find the most interesting genre to me. I ended up in the paranormal section. For 2 years I read books everyday on UFOs, cryptids, and ghosts.

I became such a nerd, and it didn't help my bullying situation any, but I loved those cryptids and aliens so much. I felt deeply connected to them for being different and misunderstood.

At 13/14 I was still undiagnosed, even though I felt like I was constantly getting so many tests done on me by the schools and doctors. They knew I had something ""wrong"" with me, but no one was educated enough to label it... And that's why I felt for the cryptids too.

I drew comics and pictures about them until I was 15 and got into anime. My interest in the Paranormal faded a bit now that I was in high school, and I became obsessed with everything Japanese.

I started drawing anime then, and it was never good or acceptable during this time. It wasn't cool back then, and it was just another thing that made me not like anyone else in my small farming town. My teachers discouraged me drawing it and told me that if I wanted to draw cartoons, then it should be American cartoons...

I got forced and manipulated into art school then where the school had a strict rule against drawing any anime. So in order to pass, I had to change my style. I went back to drawing my cryptids and alien friends.

My teachers loved it, and I often won ""best of quarter""... But my peers... They either ignored me or the few ""friends"" I was able to make there told me I wasn't good enough at drawing to join them when they hung out, this included the person I was dating at the time.

In fact, that person started to get physically abusive to me, and my art got extremely dark as a result. Some other traumatic things happened later and I ended up having a mental breakdown, suicide attempt, and self harming to where I was institutionalized against my will.

Once I survived the facility, I couldn't seem to draw how I had been, and I went back to drawing anime now that I was on my own.

I still didn't feel too good about my skill, or lack of, and the few pictures I shared online got made fun off for being shitty all the time.

The past couple of years I've been trying so hard to improve, and it's physically painful for me due to my dyspraxia (as I was properly diagnosed finally too). Since 2017 I've been applying to countless art shows and conventions just to get constant rejections. In 2018, I stopped counting at #32.

My current partner has been so supportive of me and has been trying to encourage me to draw ""the other way"" again... The darkish style I used to draw the cryptids in.

I've gotten so tired of the rejections that I have been giving it a try. So far the ""other style"" has gotten way more likes and attention on my Instagram than any anime art I ever did.

43,"I think something is wrong with me. I wake up and the first thing I do is check my phone. I read reddit, I go on social media and read the news. I can do this for an hour or two. I work which is all on a laptop. When I finish I watch Netflix or YouTube until I basically go to sleep. When I shower I bring in my laptop to watch things. When I walk I listen to music or podcasts. When my partner comes over we often watch movies in our down-time. I can’t sleep unless my phone is next to me. 

I struggle to read books now, or shower without any kind of entertainment. I want to constantly be entertained or now I’m starting to think... distracted. Does anyone else do this? How could I tone this down? Any tips? Thank you.

What should I do? Is there a way to reverse the damage that I’m sure this has done to me?

48,"This is my first post to Reddit ever so sorry if I'm doing anything wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty young, I'm in high school so I obviously don't have all the knowledge I should, and March last year I met someone during an extra curricular. We started dating the next month and I knew I found the love of my life. We hung out all summer and everything was great until school started back up. I was starting at a new school, and she was at my old one, so we only saw each other on Saturdays. I got into the school musical, and they had Saturday rehearsals a lot so we went up to a month without seeing each other. We didn't know how to cope with it, so we got into a lot of arguments and I called it quits. We were still friends, even if it was a little awkward. In December (a month later) I broke off our friendship completely. I was a dick about it, and I'll probably always regret it.

&amp;#x200B;

I think around the middle of February is when we started talking again. I officially apologized yesterday. The thing is, she's gotten over me completely and started dating a boy while we weren't friends. I've realized from talking to her again that I'm still madly in love with her. She's happy with him though, and I want more than anything for her to be happy. I hope I'll get over her in time, but I honestly think I deserve being on this side of the coin after what I did to her.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, if you've gotten this far, thanks for reading my rant. I've needed to get it out, and I honestly feel a lot better about it.",20Mar2019,1

I used to be an extreme germophobe and vomit-phobe since age 8. I once had a hand-numbing panic attack when I was 9 and my parents ordered chicken fingers at restaurant.

but after 10+ years of this I got sick of it. If I let the stupid little bacteria/salmonella scare me and control what I do, the evil little fuckers win. I don't care anymore. The pain of food poisoning is just sensory pain, I can deal with throwing up, if I ever wake up with a fever and stomach ache I can go with the flow and chill out in the shower and let fluids come out as they wish. life is not that serious, and in the 0.1% chance that you die from food poisoning, well, once you die there's no mind left to miss being alive.

53,"When I was 16 my dad took me aside and said “Everyone has to have a job and everyone has to work. The decisions you make now are going to start having a ripple effect years ahead in your life. You have to think about what’s important to you, what’s interesting to you, and the things you’re unsure of. The next couple years of your life are going to look really different if you want to be an astrophysicist than if you want to be a welder. If you want to go to college you need to apply yourself in school and start finding professors who will write you recommendation letters. If you want to learn a trade you should start seeking out apprenticeships. I don’t expect you to know what you want to do, but I expect you to be trying things out to narrow it down so when the time comes to make the decision, you’re not shooting blind.”

I think he knew that I really had no clue what costs of living was at that age so he had me write down what I *wanted* my living situation to be and then the least I could tolerate. The first time I said I wanted a 4 bedroom house in the suburbs and two top end cars and to take a foreign vacation every year, among other things, the final list was pretty involved. 

He calculated how much that all would cost and listed the kinds of jobs I would have to do and the kind of schooling those jobs required if I wanted to sustain that lifestyle. They were not appealing. 

My “least I can live with” was also extreme. I said I could tolerate  up to 6 roommates and two jobs and I could walk everywhere and I could work 7 days a week every week. 

He listed off some of the complications with that. “What if you need to go to your sister’s wedding? The kind of job that’s got you on 7 days a week might not allow for that time off. What then?” “You’re likely sharing a bedroom if you have six roommates, so what if your boyfriend comes over? They’ll be loud. You’ve got work in the morning. Every morning. How will you handle that? And you can forget pets if there’s already six of you in there.” 

Basically it was a major reality check that I couldn’t handle as much as I thought and shouldn’t expect as much as I did. It got me really seriously thinking about where my life choices were leading to. 

He repeated this exercise with me every six months until I moved out and by the time I moved out I’d gotten it down to want: two bedroom house in safe neighborhood with decent public transport. 1 car with under 50,000 miles at purchase. Weekends off. 3 weeks vacation total a year. 

And “could tolerate” up to 3 roommates assuming there are separate bedrooms, a bus pass, and working 6 days a week. 

It put everything in perspective and I was just talking to my sister about when we used to do that so I figured I’d pass it on for anyone who might need some help centering their decision making. ",20Mar2019,101

After a long day at work, I completely succumbed to morpheus arms and saw you again. We were at an airport, laughing and it was a serene and quiet view until you decided to hold me. All of a sudden, time stopped and my heart skipped a beat. Right then and there, I wished you the best of all this world could give. 

Every day that goes by, I feel jealous of everyone that has the pleasure to be in your presence. However, I am a firm believer that we are where we are needed to be and sometimes not where we would like to be. My heart aches and is anxious about meeting you and this is definitely one of those days that I feel I would have asked you for extra cuddles. 

It's 4:00 am now and I wonder if you are also thinking about me. Are you happy? Safe? Warm? Please never forget that you are loved and until our paths cross, I wish you all the happiness in the world.

57,"I post so much about this, so I’m sorry reddit gods, lol. It just hurts so bad.

My bf and I have been off and on these past few months because my family dislikes him, and I knew they weren’t going to like him since before they even met.

He’s a stoner. He works dead end jobs. He doesn’t go to school or do anything towards a career. He’s a smart ass and he has no filter. He’s arrogant. 

My mom and him got into an argument over my little sister because he was giving unsolicited dating advice. He was too blunt and coarse. She’s a sensitive teenage girl. But in his mind, he was looking out for her. She was talking about dating tough guys, and he told her that she should watch out because guys in high school only want one thing. My mom didn’t like it. My sister didn’t like it.

My mom got loud and threatening and she cornered him into the front door/entry way. She tried to discredit his past and telling him he never had to struggle for what he has like she did.

He didn’t apologize and he didn’t say good bye to my dad that night amidst the drama, despite my dad giving him the benefit of the doubt.

My older sisters believe he has nothing going for him, and that he’s mooching off of me. He doesn’t plan on doing things for himself. They think his past should fuel his future.

I know that I sound stupid for looking past these really big issues. But he made me genuinely happy. 

He taught me how to feel beautiful and confident, even when I know I’m ugly. When he has the means, he treats me and takes care of me. He often talks about a future together once he has everything in line. He always tries to make the best out of everything because he knows what it’s like to be with nothing. He lets me know he loves me. The chemistry between us is addicting and mesmerizing. I’ve never felt this way about someone before. When he kisses me and holds me tight, I feel safe and supported and cared for.

I know these emotional connections aren’t substitutes or substantial reasons to be with someone when they aren’t financially stable on their own. And I know he doesn’t know how to make the best impressions. And I know he should make a better effort to show he’s trying to move up in life.

But on the other hand, I don’t know what it’s like to be dirt poor. To have ptsd, depression, and anxiety. To have been beaten and abused by my parents, then to have someone else’s family come in and trigger my ptsd after I was trying to help. I’ve never had to live out in a tent. Or worry about where my next meal is going to come from. Or have so many people look down on me because they’re quick to judge but don’t try to hear my story.

I love this man to pieces. I love him so much with all of my heart. But I don’t think it’s going to happen between us because a number of reasons. He has so much potential to be something great and I believe he can do it. I believe in him.

I don’t want to say goodbye to him. I don’t want to throw away what we have. But with the way he is and the way my family is... it’s destined to crash and burn.

A lot of people will agree with my family and question why I don’t feel the same as them when he sucks. But it’s hard to want to throw someone away when you got to experience a new type of love, for the first time, with him. He opened my heart in new ways and he showed me that love isn’t so dependent.

I don’t believe that anyone’s going to read all of this or read it again I should say. But I just want to feel better. Thanks. ",20Mar2019,4
58,"For the longest time I wasn’t sure what to call it. It’s as if over time I realized my cognitive ability to process thought had slowed to a crawl. Everything seemed numb and unimportant. Weeks upon weeks I would spend days with zero thoughts in my head. Yes I noticed it, and sure it was weird, but I was ok with it. I’m an average adult, I work and go to school. But I remember days when sadness and melancholy were rampant as a child, and for once in my life I was at peace to a degree. I thought this (brain fog) was actually just me moving on and growing up. But, I was wrong, very wrong. Brain fog is real, and it’s affecting my relationships, my schooling. People see me differently, and it’s easy to just let the days fly by. After doing some research a number of things could be causing this. For one I have a very poor diet, I take admittedly take more Advil than I should for chronic headaches. I get no exercise either. I miss being productive, being alert, being aware. And being able to process information faster, a majority of information I don’t even remember as my memory has gotten horrible.

61,"I identify as pan sexual and I live in a heterosexual, very fulfilling monogamous relationship with my SO. 

I love my life; I love my SO;  I love my kids but there is a hole I cannot fill.

I have not seen my Father for nearly 4 years and haven't had any kind of relationship with him for about 10 years. The last-time I saw him was in a courtroom. Yeah, my relationship with him has been nothing but toxic even from when I was a child. He took issue with my sexuality; he took issue with my SO; he took issue with how I raise my children, my decision to further educate myself at university, religion, everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

About 10 years ago I realised that my family of origin were toxic people and I was better off without them. THEN THEY TURNED ON ME. Long story short I had to use the court system to permanently remove me and my family from their influence.  

&amp;#x200B;

Weird thing is that whenever I achieve anything in my life, I just want my Father to be proud. I actively avoid films that include a story where a Father and Son reunite after years. I seek out Father figures in my life to ""brag"" to about my life, then when they respond in kind I push them away. I refuse to look up to anyone as a hero. I instantly mistrust any older male who is kind to me or my family. But most of all... I feel empty inside. 

&amp;#x200B;

I look for relationships that emulate what I miss in a father figure. When holidaying with my family, I seek out weird older men to establish a strange temporary ""father-son"" relationship with in the hope that I can get some fatherly approval from. I just want a Father to be proud of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot understand this side of me and at times it drives me crazy. Anyone else feel this way? Thanks for reading this far... Reddit makes me feel things that at times help me forget that I was raised in a cult by and abusive Father.

He was hit by a car while he was on his bike 2 days ago. He's had very bad brain swelling and bleeding and is in a pediatric icu in a medically induced coma. His mom told me he has a 50:50 chance. It feels like we’re in hell.

I am so angry but that anger is useless. I’m mad at the person who hit him. I’m mad that he was alone. I’m mad I couldn’t prevent this.

She herself has said the only reason she did this is because she knows that my PC is the only thing I truly love and is the only thing that I can get entertainment out of.*

This isn't all though. I have an abusive relationship with my mother. **And she's not throwing the punches here.** We don't get along at all. She never listens to me without repeating myself over and over to the point of rage, and by then I forcefully push her out of my room if she is in there. But most times she comes right back in/stands right outside my door continuing to talk/lecture  me. I end up snapping, insulting her with all my 15yr old brain can muster, and it's not just 'oh f\*\*k off already', it's like '*You're so thick that if I threw you out of the window you'd be able to walk it off after wondering what happened*' (we live on the 1st floor). She gets pretty big bruises from me. If she doesn't talk to me, and only makes food/washes clothes, we 'get along'. Oh yeah and I have an 11yr old sister who has to spectate this. And there is no 'father' to speak of, we basically cut comms with him a few years ago.

*I have a therapist whom I have been seeing almost every week since last year June. She's really nice, listens to me, provides insight to difficulties I might not see, and overall just really wants to help. My mum also has one. For* *~~weeks~~* *months, my mental state has been deteriorating, and my therapist has seen and heard that. I've been referred to* [*CAMHS*](https://youngminds.org.uk/find-help/your-guide-to-support/guide-to-camhs/) *on the basis that my Therapist deemed that I have Depression, backed up by my GP and my school, both of whom have expedited the process by telling them something along the lines of 'this is urgent'. I'll be heading there for assessments on both my mental and physical well being, with almost blanket-style tests to diagnose anything that I might have. My appointment is next week, so hopefully this should be over and done with relatively soon.*

Now, the reason I have a therapist in the first place is because I was put into foster-care throughout year 8 because of these reasons. My mum used to be a massive hoarder, which I had to live with since I was born. This means piles of stuff everywhere with almost no organisation and order to it all. For a few years, we had a horrible infestation of bedbugs EVERYWHERE. It was a nightmare. Social services became involved due someone notifying them of this, don't know who. Wish I did. I was put into a really nice million pound (house's worth) placement for what should have been 6 weeks. Ended up being 1 year.

*Yesterday, we had a 'review' session at therapy with me, my mum, and both of our therapists there. They became incredibly worried about the situation that has arisen, as I have been wanting to go* ***back*** *into foster-care for some time now. They have now also referred me to social services today, and now in the coming weeks/months I will be waiting for updates.*

I finally decided that I need to do something about it, so I went to my doctor. That was scary enough, but rather than giving me a referral, she gave me a number of a free counselling service to call. 

Like many people, I really hate talking on the phone. The next day, I build up the courage to phone the number. Apparently I had to fill out a form online before phoning them, so I went online and did the form and phoned them back. After a quick chat with a lady on the phone, she arranged a phone call appointment with a therapist the next day to get an idea of how I'm feeling. 

I anxiously waited til the next day and had a chat with the therapist. This was very hard for me, but I managed to talk to her. Then she said she would discuss with her colleague about what the next step would be. Now she has just phoned back telling me that I should phone a different organisation.

86,"First time posting here. For clarification, I am 17, male still in school doing my last year until I graduate and go off to college. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you look through my few post before, they're all the same, just on and on about this one same girl. I've known her for 5 years now, friends for 4. Over the course of this 5 year I manage to develop a crush for her, since the first time I met her, and those feelings only continued to grow on me the more I got to know her. It didn't take me very long, say 3 months upon getting to know her, we got really close and I loved everything about her. We texted occasionally and it grew from there and we texted more often to almost daily. So being that 14 years old me who was still stupid obviously I felt the need to tell people about my feeling for her and just so coincidentally it was a close friend of hers. Now I never got to know how she found out but she did regardless. At first she started texting me less, and me still madly in love didn't see the signs and I kept texting her anyway and it was a lot but she still replied and we still talked a lot. Things kind of felt awkward afterwards but whatever. So a few more months later she started dropping clear red flags of disinterest often times talking about other guys in front of me and things but I never got the sign so she took it upon herself to come up and inform me that she knows and that she wasn't interested. At that point she had blocked me over WhatsApp a few weeks back saying we talked too much. Now having heard those harsh words, I wasn't really too taken aback or hurt by them because :  I had already been blocked and our interactions irl was a little weird after I felt awkward so I was pretty much losing those feels. My friend reassured me it will be okay but honestly I wasn't really that hurt by it, more disappointed than anything. The rest of that year was pretty bland we didn't talk much or any at all but that was fine by me.

&amp;#x200B;

So now we go on to the next year which I was so conveniently placed in a different class and didn't have to go through that awkward time. Although we did share a few classes together. A month into the year, one day during one of our classes together, I was told by a friend of mine and hers that she felt sorry about last year and turning me down and everything, I had already gotten over it at that point and told him to let her know it was fine. For some reason which I do not remember why, I started seating with her during those classes, although they were short and we didn't talk much, I was happy to be there to have her as my friend but deep down there was some other feeling that has yet to show itself. As a few more months passed she seemed to be more like the ""her a year ago"" she'd often ask me to sit with her during class and talk to me. Sometimes she'd put her head on my shoulder or throw her legs on mine. All these small things seemed to have sparked something in me and that feeling deep down before showed itself once again revealing my feelings for her once more. Knowing how it ended the first time, I didn't tell anyone nor did I act on it, and I had hoped it would leave just all my previous crushes would have, just a short period of time and eventually fades away, but of course it didn't. Now although we talked, we didn't text over the phone anymore, maybe once a while like once a month but not really, even in school I didn't talk a lot, I was more happy to be in her company than anything. I believe a month before her birthday, she made a joke about getting a gift and that really pushed my feelings more and made me get her a Parker pen with her name engraved on it. She had previously told me to just get her some pencil but I took it a bit too far. Now I believe she thought I had lost all feelings for her up until that pen. That pen was what got her whole family to know of my existence and as the boy that clearly likes her. We had a state exam that year and after that we had about a month of nothing to do in school so we all played around but I felt like the pen made it really awkward with me and her so our time together was minimal although I craved it a lot. School ended and we went back to get our exam results, a few days later she texted me asking about my results and that was the first time my heart had jumped or skipped a beat getting a message. We talked for a bit but not a lot, the rest of that year didn't had much in it but we knew that we were going to end up in the same class the year after.

&amp;#x200B;

So comes the year, we are now 16, same class, the first month or two was still awkward, later we manage to sit together in a group and that group later became a new group of friends. Another girl sat in between us that became a close friend of ours up till now. Now she was still aware that I still have feelings for her and somehow later that new group of friends came to know, through how I acted around her and of course her telling them all that I had once had feelings for her and still do. That year we got closer, we went out with that group of friends a few times and with that mutual close friend a lot more. Now we started texting each other more and it only kept going. On her birthday she spent it with me and that mutual friend despite having another group of friend she had who were her closest group of friends. Anyway the rest of that year was just me and her getting closer with each other, occasionally she'd ask to have my watches and we switched wallet and her purse, she also gave me a picture of her in my wallet. Towards Novemeber when school was about to be over we started calling each other, and those calls started getting more frequent until they were basically daily. As December arrived everyone had holidays planned, she was going overseas and wanted me to wake up 4 in the morning to talk with her before she gets on the plane which she did. While travelling she spent a lot of time back in the hotel telling me about how much she missed me, because she shared a room with her sister she couldn't call me, although she did once or twice and they were short. A week later after she was back, I was travelling this time around, which this time she woke up at 5 to talk to me before I leave. And the whole time I was there back in my hotel was her telling me how much she misses me and wants to call me. As soon as I got back that night we called for a few hours and stayed on the phone while we slept which was becoming common, accoding to her thisw as what her sister did with a boyfriend although I didn't understand why we are doing it. But I was having too much fun and my feelings for her only kept growing since last year. She would often times asks me why I like her over the calls and I never really answered until about New Years time.

&amp;#x200B;

So, come this year we're both now 17, to our surprise going back to school, we were not in the same class anymore this year which came as a surprise to us both, she was really sad about it and wanted the school administration to change her back but in the end didn't. Over the 2/3 weeks of that happening she cried about it and texted and called me talked about it and how much she missed me. We still continued calling everyday. Now one random Friday she asked me if I would be going for prom this year and things happened quickly from there, that was when I first made my reddit post asking for advice which ended in me asking to date her (**Disclaimer :** More in depth detail in my old posts, this is the simplest most tl;dr I am doing so not the full story not even close) . She asked me why I hadn't done it a year earlier (we've got a nationwide exam this year) but after a lot of hesitation came around and agreed. It didn't last though two days before she said she couldn't do it, but she did say she has commitment issues which I do believe. Given a rough childhood experience mainly because of a divorced parent situation and even now both side of the family still have problems with their new family, she has gone through a lot. It was a weird period but eventually we got back to being close like we were, text daily and calls. We decided on going out for my birthday which was close before we broke up after that 2 day relationship, we went out but we invited that mutual friend because she wanted her there, later that day, we held hands during the movie and also after our friend left, she kept holding on to me and hugged me a lot, gave me kisses on the cheeks and had my first kiss with her on the lips. That night she said she wanted to do something special for my birthday and we ended up having phone sex. The few days after things were really weird, we texted a lot and called but it was like she seemed interested in getting back together again. But which was later revealed to be not true, which later she showed signs again and basically it became a week of her interested and the next not anymore. The phone sex happened a few more times, and eventually we established a ""exclusive but not in a relationship"" status since she didn't want to commit. Later over calls we started talking about going on a holiday together by the end of the year and also us living together in the future. It seemed to me like the wanted something but later a week late she seemed all not so interested anymore. Up till recently we still had phone sex and we still text and call each other. But recently shes been showing signs of disinterest again just after her texting me every morning and calling me the moment I get home, now she doesn't even reply to messages ive sent her and shes read. I wake up every morning now expecting a text and I don't get one so I send her one, I get home expecting her to ask if I am back and getting a call but instead I am the one asking. I sometimes feel needy about wanting so much from her but I love her so much I want to talk to her all the time and that clearly makes me needy. But it hurts me when she seems to disinterested. I've been conflicting with myself on whether or not I should text her in the morning, ask her if shes home and call her, I feel like im coming off as too needy, but I also feel like I will lose her if I don't (Even though she isn't mine to lose and I know but she clearly makes it seem like that). Recently I've been finding myself having so much thoughts I want it all to end, I haven't had suicidal thoughts but have definitely want it all to end and just be able to stop worrying about her. Other times I am just bombarded with so much feelings that I literally don't understand what I am feeling anymore, its like im having a bad day but I have nothing to feel bad about, but I still do, but I don't just feel bad I feel empty. Im feeling like that right now, not knowing how im feeling but all I know is that it doesn't feel good at all. ",20Mar2019,6

96,"Hello people.

I don't know what's been happening to me these past months, but I always feel like there is no hope for me in life. And it's strange because most of my life I've been a very ambitious person, I always tried to be the best version of myself, actively worked out, tried my best at high school, started a job immediately after graduating high school to start my career and got promoted within a year. 

But now as I've reached young adulthood it seems like I can't take all this pressure. I go to work everyday, then come home and study for college and almost have no free time. I barely hangout with my friends or any people at all. I've been single for the past 3 years and I don't think that's gonna change for a while because I am at the point of life where all I do is work and work to keep functioning at life. 

Also, I started to try to empty this loneliness by spending,.. a lot. I buy new technology, buy take out food, go on vacations almost every month for a weekend, visiting new cities because I am bored, buying books and videogames to keep myself entertained, but hardly ever touch them because I have no time. All this spending let to me having almost no saved money at all. Also I still live with my parents (22 years old) and I have to move out soon and the rent in my city is just unaffordable. 

So right now, I am 22, stuck in a dead end office job that I am too afraid to quit, going to college and almost never meeting my friends or hanging out with my family. I just can't balance all of this. And I feel hopeless because there is no other way to my life. I can't just drop out of college. If I quit my job, I have no guarantee the next one will be any better and have almost no friends and have no idea where to make them. Also there's the money situation. Also I feel like when I finally move out and live alone, I'll just become lonely and depressed, because I have no one in my life

My friend, let’s call him John
The girls can be called Ruby and Katie and the one not from my school can be Lauren
Let’s call my brother Ben

September:

It all starts in september 2018, a fresh new year of school, I’m in the last year of high school, year 11. Felt great to be the oldest, but I knew my exams were creeping up on me, after miserably failing my English, Maths and Sciences mock exams. Everything was going fine, my brother began facetiming a girl a lot, “Ruby”. I asked him why he’d been facetiming her so much and he told me they were going out. Bare in mind Ruby is my age and probably one of the best looking, popular girls in my school. I only go to a small school. About 500 students, that doesn’t make her any less pretty.


I message her on snapchat and say jokingly “stop noncing on my brother”. For anyone reading from outside the UK, a nonce is a pedophile, and noncing is when you’re being a pedo on little kids. Anyway, she said they’re just friends. I didn’t believe her as I had heard the stuff they were talking about, and also a few days later hacked into Bens snapchat (I spend a lot of time learning how to hack and shit, big nerd) and seen their messages, it was definitely true. This one message I sent was probably the worst thing I ever done. We start talking on the regular. She starts hanging out with me at school, her beauty blinds me from the knowledge of her and Ben.

November:

Me and her get really close and I develop feelings for her in around November, I’ve always been attracted to her, she’s stunning honestly. She hints a few things to me and I begin to think she likes me, despite all the friend zone references such as “you’re a great best friend” and just constantly commenting on us being just friends, but also using body language to suggest she wants something else. My brother tells a few people still that they’re dating in secret, I was skeptical.

December:

I begin talking to two girls, only really as a friend for one of them (“Katie”), more intimately for another (“Lauren”) (this girl being not in my school and living in the adjacent town to ours) She was very pretty, good body and wanted to hook up. I’ve never told a soul about this, I had kissed girls before, but was a virgin. I meet with her and we go out for a bit, (it wasn’t our first time meeting, I knew her through friends) we went back to her parents place, who were conveniently out and we had sex and watched netflix and shit.

Note to virgins, it’s nothing like porn, and you won’t last 20 minutes like the guys in porn. Also I’m sorry if this is hard to follow, my mind is all over the place at the moment.

So a few days later Ruby, who I still have feelings for, despite the hookup, which was a one time thing. Ruby messages me and is upset and thinks I replaced her with the two girls, Katie and Lauren, as they were higher places on my friends list on snapchat than her. I know, petty. Here’s a little bit more context, I used to call this girl every night and we’d watch Netflix shows at the same time, she took up my whole life. I loved her :(

Christmas holidays come and I get closer to Katie, she’s a shy girl she’s cute but I think of her only as a friend, she confesses feelings to me and I kinda play dumb. Whatever, not a major event that even matters, just helps for context.

January:

My birthday :) I turn 16, this is one day before school starts again. A few weeks into the school week I find out about Ruby and Ben. I call my friend “John” and tell him about it. I act cool but the whole time I was muting my mic and crying uncontrollably, I was in love and my heart was broken. My whole life had been a lie. I turned to drugs, spending most of my life on a computer I knew where to get them, dark web.

I bought weed and LSD. Did them with my friend John. LSD is amazing. Anyway, it did cause problems, I got angry a lot, got into lots of fights at school and broke lots of stuff, including my wall (punched a hole in it), my computer, my iPad, my bathroom door and my front door window. I liked breaking things, I broke a thumb and split all my nuckles, I know have scars from when I punched through my window. This girl fucked me up.

February:

Me and this girl go on being friends, even though I know what she’s done to me. We argued a lot and she made me want to kill myself. This was the toughest month of my life. She manipulated me and made me feel bad about what she had done, she was evil to me. I still want to kill myself. I want it to end. We had an on and off friendship with little intervals where I’d remember what she did to me. I kept smoking weed and I still do at least twice a week, keep in mind i’m 16, it’s not good for me.

March:

Same as february, just want to die, I am writing this paragraph in march, I save this and write in little intervals or I can’t cope. At the start of this month I got in a fight with my dad. He’s a cunt. I punched him in the face after he grabbed me by the neck. I broke his nose, next day he was hospitalised by a car accident. I felt like utter shit. I started the argument the day before. I felt like it was my fault.

Ruby tells me the truth, one that I believe. She was going out with my brother, and began to develop feelings for me. I know, it’s very fucked up, incest lmao. I told her the truth and she said she still kind of liked me. I lost all respect for her.  Most boys would be happy to hear that. No. She’s going out with my brother.

I’ve been selling drugs and spray painting my little gang logo everywhere. I’m gonna end up in jail sooner or later, but I don’t care. All I want is her.

Today I messaged her and I wrote a huge paragraph telling her to get out my fucking life. But I love her. I am obsessed with her. She’s drive me into a mental state

Now:

Thanks for reading this, if this post gets enough attention I’ll make an update. I might kill myself, I wanna go out with a bang, I wanna do something big. Thanks. Bless you all :)

105,"These questions come to my mind all the time... i dont know where to start to improve my self...

How to stop pleasing others w/o being an asshole ? How can i make friends w/o making my self seem foolish? How do i stop being an invisible person??? How to have a personality? How to love my self?
How to be a man??? Why i dont have my own opinion? Why my imagination is so small? Why others never chase me? And i have to chase them all the time? Why i cant have my own opinions? Im too lazy or too dumb or create my own? How do i create my own? Why others are more manly than me? Why others are smarter than me? Why others have a cooler personality than me?
How can i stop being this loser pathetic mindless nice guy i am right now?
Why i cant get much RTs or likes like others? My opinions dont matter ??
Why others dont chase me? Or even care enough to say hello? They never do.. im i a worthless piece of shit that no one cares about or what?
I dont know who i am.. or who i wanna be. I dont know how to find out who i want to be..
How do i stop being invisible? By loving myself? 
How appear dangerous and other people dont take me as a joke?

I only get replied by one words or maybe i dont know how to ask questions.

Why girls dont chase me? Why i always have to chase girls?? Im nervous around girls even in texts.. i dont know what topic to talk about...

I can talk about many things but soon i run out and i will be boring most timed i dont know how to start them..

Its like i want to have friends. In my place you cant be friends with girls unless its online even that one hard. 
If you have sex with a girl you will get killed sometimes.
Muslim country.

These questions come in my mind everyday. Maybe im overthinking a lot.. i even think about why i exist or how the world works or whats my purpose or just thinking about how each of us is different from one another... 

I always try to be funny so i get validated or likeable by others.. i dont know what the fuck to talk about.

I dont know who i am.. or who i wanna be. I dont know how to find out who i want to be..i dont know what being a man means.. how can i be a man and still likeable. 


You know i just want to get validated so bad.. but i dont even know how to validate my self.. if i dont give it my all and try my hardest just to a girl give me a chance to talk to her... i guess im that low and pathetic...

If i dont try i will be a shy or quiet dumb invisible beta male that even his family doesnt like...

I dont know how to be likeable my others.. i guess at this point im living for others not my self...

I dont even know how to make a fucking friend... i suck at starting conversatios.
Im that guy that no girl likes her and they think of him as invisible...

God help me...Fuck my life im a piece of hot garbage...


I guess i just want to be a cool guy that has friends i dont want to be someone who others think is shy or sensitive or rude or arrogant or a mindless absent minded loser... i never want to be these.. i just want to be seen as a cool guy and a funny guy...

Or at least i want to talk someone about these...thanks. these came out to my mind with nofap. Will try to do nofap.",20Mar2019,0

I have been with my boyfriend for 6 years and he is usually pretty supportive of me and makes me feel attractive. He supports me in losing weight and agrees that I need to, which I’m ok with. But...the other day we were laying on the couch and he starting rubbing my belly and said “I’m gonna miss your belly when it’s gone”. I was really offended and found it really condescending, even though he says he didn’t mean it in a mean way. My feelings were really hurt. Am I overreacting or do I have the right to feel upset??

112,"Especially in terms of music. We kinda grew apart a bit in late 2016 since another friend of us sold his Ps4, and he did the same a few months after afaik. I probably had my best moments of gaming with those guys, even though we were only in contact for around half a year! Unfortunately they both moved to PC, and my PC is complete trash haha. Was thinking about hitting them up anyways some time, just to chat a bit and get up-to-date on what everyone is doing right now. Just can't really bring myself to do it. Don't want to come across as awkward or desperate texting them :D 

I don't know. It just seems so stupid to basically do the exact same things (Learning something in the coding area, listening to the exact same music, smoking weed, gaming in our pastime, etc.), but completely independently.

Ive read so much debate about switching to Dvorak, apparently no one can really tell if it's faster, a lot of people say the improvements are very minor but the worlds fastest recording wpm is 216 set on Dvorak keyboard. I've also heard that Colemak is a faster alternative to QWERTY (I believe only 17 keys are changed).

119,"I've had problems ever since I was a child, never had much self confidence, spent lunch times hiding away in corners crying. For me the most important thing has been love. Had a crush on a girl from years 4-6 went to secondary school liked someone from years 8-9 then came my obsession I was convinced I loved this girl from years 10-13. It started ok we were just talking as friends do but over the years she stopped talking to me and me being the idiot I am did lots of stupid things like cutting myself and threatening to kill myself. This along with drug use then completely fucked up my mind. One day I was at a friends and i did md and a lot of weed, I thought I was in a time loop and it was one of the most horrible experiences of my life. After this I then had depersonalization for just over a year, which almost gets us caught up to now. About a month ago when I was still obsessed over this girl and I thought I was going insane due to depersonalzation I went to a friends house party and he also invited his girlfriend. After he passed out and everyone else had gone to sleep me and his gf were alone together. Now like I said I have no self confidence and had never done anything before so i never assumed anything would ever happen between us but it did. Although we only kissed it was a massive deal at the time and one of the best nights of my life even though I was being a total dick to my friend. The next day when I went home I instantly missed her and really wanted to see her on top of this my depersonalization had seemed to be gone and this girl I was obsessed with before suddenly meant nothing to me. I told my friend everything that had happened with his gf and then they broke up. Then out of absolutely no where I had this massive confidence boost and decided i was going to see her, after I asked ofc, even though she lived 150 miles away and I had never done anything like this before. And that week was easily the best week of my life it was amazing we got on so well she made me so happy and I didnt think i would ever lose my virginity because I thought no girl could ever even like me yet she knows everything about me and still likes me. So now 1 month later she is currently working her dream job 200 miles away with barely any time off so I cant see her for 9 months which by itself I can deal with but it seems as though she doesnt even care about me anymore with blunt replies and my friend is also understandably mad so I am all alone with no one to talk to or ask for help.

120,"I don't want to discourage you, but at the moment I am feeling lost.  


A little over three months ago I decided I was tired of waiting for the perfect time to go to college, and that I was going to start right then. I even had the confidence that that post 9/11 GI bill would be enough to live on. Getting paid to focus on my studies? What could be better than that?  


But now everything has gone wrong.   


I finished the first quarter of classes and realized I should get a part time job. Only, my licence expired and I need to get a valid ID. I moved here out of state over a year ago, so it's the proper time to do those things. Thinking about this, it turned out the tags on my car are expired as well. I tried to go get a new drivers licence and they told me the account is flagged from the last state. Apparently it was suspended years ago without me knowing. I can get by without driving for a few months, so I'll get a regular state ID. But that costs more money than what I have right now.  


I saw there was some fraud on my debt card, so I cancelled it over the phone and they told me to go into a nearby location to pick up a temporary one. I went in and they can't give me one because my old ID is past the expiration date.   


I'll get paid my stipend next week. I do not know if it will be enough to handle everything I need to function in society again.   


At this point, the only option I see is selling off all the things that I like but don't need. The equipment I bought last year for the podcast I've been doing. The laptop I recorded it on. The PS4 I wasted time on. 

  
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

&amp;#x200B;

Before this, I worked a job that I didn't like very much. I had been there for years and ended up making decent enough money to live on. Most nights ended with feeling like there was something better out there, that there was an opportunity in education. Now I feel more panicked than ever before. The best option might be to sell what's left and try to get back with that company again, as they were hoping I would come back.  


I don't know what to do anymore.",20Mar2019,2
121,"Where. Do. I. Start.

So, a bit of context. I work in a shop that, amongst other things, sells phones. I am not initially serving this woman, but i am asked to take over after another colleague can't understand what she's looking for.

At first, she is asking something along the lines of wanting a phone which she can remove the 'memory' and plug it into a TV. I am assuming she is referring to videos or photos so explain thst, nowadays, alot of phones have means of transferring data to a screen, be it via a cable or through using a micro sd.

Then it starts to get weird.

She starts asking about how she could go about interchanging the phones internal memory, saying she would ideally like to be able to open the phone up, take out the internal memory and put another in, and potentially interchange between several, frequently. I explain to her that, unfortunately, phones are not as modular as she may believe and that in the phones she was looking at, it would be a lot of work and require a particular skill set to be able to do it without damaging the handset.

She explains that she wants to be able to control everything that gets saved on to her device, mentioning in particular Web site cookies and search histories.

I mentioned to her, while explaining how she might go about opening up a device if she really wanted to (although I did advise against it) that I myself had opened up a few old phones in the past. She asked me if I had ever found anything that 'didn't look like it should be there', and then went on to explain that another reason she wanted to get into her phone is to check for government trackers.

She tells me she wants to be able to turn everything, such as GPS and location off, and asks about Internet security. I tell her that she would most likely have to download an app for further security that the device doesn't itself provide. She doesn't like downloading apps because, as she says, she feels they steal your data and personal information. 

This also spurs her to ask a question about card transactions in shops, as she says she feels that it gives the shop all of her personal information; home address, phone number. I explain to her that, when making a payment by card, the card machine, and thus the store, will only take the amount paid, and bank details required for the transaction, I.e, account holder name, sort code, account number.

Satisfied with the phone, we went to the till, and then happened the thing that I just can't wrap my head around.

Up until now, I could comprehend the suspicion of government surveillance and what not, but before handing over the money, £120 in tens and twenties, she removed a piece of paper with some scrawlings on and proceeded to write down the serial number of each bank note.

Since this happened, it has been driving me crazy as to why she may have done this. Is it a part of her conspiracy paranoia, and if so, in what way? What would she do with these serial numbers? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. ",20Mar2019,3

Facts, I know.

I'm pretty shy and can be awkward or not know what to say at times. but, really when I'm relaxed or around a familiar crowd its no problem to be more of myself. i enjoy making people laugh and i'm good at it. people have called me secretly hilarious and i really like that compliment, but i see how it could be saying i keep a lot to myself.

stupid shit i do: she an attractive girl randomly and don't make eye contact or look, just hope that maybe they look my way and i see them out my peripheral.. god, that's embarrassing to admit. but, i've always been that way; just shy or caring what people might think of me. when i do make eye contact i find an excuse: she's not into me, that was awkward eye contact, you're staring, or ""great i made eye contact. now what?"" i find a lot of excuses and honestly it is from a lack of trying.

One side of me says I did nothing wrong and he(it was a Male friend) was the one that ruined it while the other side is saying yeah you totally screwed this up. He wanted to cut ties with me because I was ""Abusing my privilage of knowing about his life"" or something like that. I really cant wrap my head around what he meant but when I thought about it, I realized what I did. 

You see, he was struggling in life(like everyone) and his depression was hitting him hard too. I guess my eyes couldn't see it clearly even though I suffer the same thing as well so I said things I should have never said. Around his other friends I would say ""Well I dont think he would [insert something] really do that."" I was assuming too much like I knew everything about him. I believe that is what hurt him and made him angry at me. He really left a scar on me with his last words he gave me before cutting it off. 

""You're mental! Go to a mental hospital!""

Those words really hurt me more than they should have that I legit cried all night. I have moved on but thinking about it still makes my head hurt.
