3,"This is my first time post on reddit or even really being on here so forgive me for any grammatical errors or if this ends up being a long read, I just have a lot I need to get off my chest. I’ll try to keep it as organized and possible. 

I’m currently attending community college and graduating very soon with an associates. I’m living with my mother and I also don’t have a job or have ever had one. I’ve tried applying to a lot of different places with no luck so I’d appreciate any tips or advice on how to go about it correctly because I feel like I’m going about it wrong. 

As for my mother, she was somewhat emotionally absent during my upbringing because she was very caught him in her deteriorating marriage with my abusive father so I feel like I can’t connect or talk to her about my feelings. The times I have tried to sit down and tell her that her being overbearing and smothering is hurting me as a person she’s told me I was ridiculous and sarcastically says things like “oh so it’s all my fault” The times I do try to do things on my own she often intervenes with very odd worries. I’m very small and for my age so she always thinks I’m going to get assaulted anywhere if I’m alone. Recently I told her I was going to a concert in California by myself and we got into an argument because she told me she didn’t want me going alone, it also angered my brother and he told me if anything bad happens not to bother talking to them because he won’t help me. When I told her she always finds ways to keep me stuck here she tells me that I need to start acting like an adult, but when I try to go somewhere on my own she tries hard to stop me. I’ve decided I’m going anyways if I get a ticket, I’ve always wanted to go somewhere alone and I feel like it’ll be a big step for me. I’m good on safety and have planned out a lot of things in case of emergencies in regards to people I can contact. 

I guess the advice I want is how to set boundaries or what I can do to give me some slack or what to even do in general. She never taught me how to drive but I currently have my permit and am on my way to getting my license. She holds her giving me rides over my head and basically told me I’m not an adult because I can’t get around and told me if I wanna be an adult so bad then to find a way to get to school. Currently looking into public transportation. 

It really fucks with my head because I feel like I’m not trying enough or that I’m not really an adult, it’s hard for me to tell if maybe a lot of this is my own fault or a pity party I’m throwing or if I’m not trying hard enough, or if she’s just being mentally or emotionally abusive. I just feel really stuck and mentally exhausted all the time. If I’m ever somewhere alone she calls and calls until I pick up. She knocks on my bedroom door nonstop until I open it, she once got mad that I asked her not to barge in without knocking. I now lock it. Lately it’s been fucking me up a lot mentally and I’m just not sure what to do. My brother doesn’t really help and he just says things like it’s because she’s worried about me being somewhere alone because I’m a girl. They keep treating me like I have to have my hand held and taken everywhere. I feel really stunted as a person and sometimes I feel like maybe I’m still really immature. I’ve ruled out having a serious talk about my emotions, she turns it into her being the victim or writes my emotions off as me being ridiculous or mean. I’m having trouble being able to tell if maybe I’m the problem or something. ",28Feb2019,2

11,"Back before I started college a few years back, I was in a very toxic relationship. One that involved... We'll say... ""rough housing"". I wanted to break up with him 4 months in our relationship, but I ended up staying with him for two whole years. He constantly made me feel like shit and would tell me that I wouldn't survive without him. He stripped away a lot of my confidence and self-esteem from me. I was no longer this extroverted studious person. I stopped going to my classes, didn't do any of my assignments, and I wouldn't even try in my exams. I was just really depressed.

Two weeks after my birthday, we went out on a date at an empty park to makeup for him not doing anything for my birthday and not showing up at the party. I *was* a virgin. He ""took my flower"". ***Took***. I didn't hand it to him. I didn't allow it, but he did it. After that, I broke up with him before I started my second year of college. I thought I would be better after that, but I didn't. In fact, I got worse. I constantly thought about wanting to take my life and actually attempted a few times. After my third time, my friends heavily encouraged me to go to a therapist. I went to the one my college provided just so I can hide it from my parents better (they don't really believe in therapy even though I'm going into psychology //ironic, I know//).

Now that I am better and doing well, I constantly feel like I'm not going to make it into medical school because of my horrible grades from before. I'm in constant fear that I'm working towards this M.D. goal, but... It would all be for nothing.  I constantly wonder if any med school will take me, but I have my days where I just want to give up because I constantly feel like I fucked up so much that no one will take me. I was an amazing student before I stepped into college and I'm beginning to prove it again this semester, but... I feel like because I was fucked up and couldn't get my shit together for the longest time because of this traumatizing event that... I won't be able to reach my dreams... Is there still hope? Should I give just give up?... It's scary to think about and now that I am doing better... I think about this thought more and more. ",28Feb2019,1

18,"My grandpa has been in the hospital for close to a week. They sent him home today with hospice care. He didn't even make it through the whole day.

My grandma passed away in 2013, and I know how hard this has been on my mom (losing her last parent). She, my sister, and I all went up to spend 4 days with him over President's Day weekend. She had already planned on going back pretty soon, and decided to head up today when she found out they were sending him home with hospice. Her flight got in around 3 (we are in Texas, her family is in Illinois). He passed away about 6:30. 

I'm so glad she got there in time. And I absolutely planned on going up for the funeral. I'm finally in a place with my life where I have paid time off and the finances to go. My sister doesn't have any paid leave days available because she just started a new job (husband is Air Force and they just switched duty stations). My dad can't go because my parents have 4 dogs to take care of (too costly to board and we don't have anyone they reliably trust to care for them). I thought at least I could be there for my mom. 

Now I can't go either. My dog had a weird bowel movement this afternoon, so I ran the fecal sample to the vet. He has giardia. He can't board until he's been clear for 10 days after finishing his medicine. And because of the contagiousness, he can't even go to my parents' house. Unfortunately I don't have anyone nearby either that can come and stay with him. Plus, with him being sick, I don't feel comfortable leaving.

My mom has a lot of family around, but she's my mom, and I want to be there for her. Plus, I never imagined that I would be missing my grandpa's funeral.

The whole reason why I like fitness is because it's fun to experiment and learn stuff! I love trying new things. I love reading articles, finding new exercises. I've been lifting seriously for 2 years now and I still have so much more stuff I want to figure out. I love trying new exercises, I love trying new rep schemes, new everything.

25,"My girlfriend and I parted ways amicably. We were together for 2 years but something changed between the two of us. We both noticed it and decided to separate. The song ""Happier"" by Marshmello and Bastille actually made me realize that the breakup is looming. And I guess the song summed up how our relationship went.

 I never messaged her ever since, that is, until recently.

I don't know why I did. When we broke up, she said she still liked to be friends and I stupidly said okay to it. So I messaged her just this week and we exchanged messages. I thought I was fine, I thought I had already moved on.

But it turns out, (surprise, surprise) I haven't moved on yet. Because, people of reddit, when we broke up, I didn't do anything about our pictures, all her gifts and letters, everything that reminded me of her. They were still in my phone, still in my room. To ""move on"" I just chose to ignore those things and kept on distracting and distracting myself with other things (work/Netflix/dogs/fandom).

I don't know if talking to her again is a good thing or a bad thing. But at least it made me realize that I still hadn't moved on yet. Right now, I had just deleted her phone number from my contacts, deleted our snaps that I saved and unfollowed her IG. What should I do with our pictures together? We had travelled a lot and we have lots of memorable pictured together in beautiful places. What should I do with the gifts she sent me?

We communicate through a messenger app, but right now I think it would be better for me to not be in contact with her until I had moved on. Please talk me out of contacting her again. I do not know if I should just ghost her or do I tell her that I don't want to be in contact anymore? Do I tell her that I haven't moved on yet?

I had watch and try to take care of my mom as her ability to speak and  move worsened, all while (not) dealing with my own depression. Those memories can be very painful so I tend to remember her through pictures, and memorable moments, which is good in it's own way. They act as a catalyst and I can reexperience how loved, happy, or angry she made me feel again. Even though revisiting the past feels muted, it's good enough for most days. Other days it's not, and I just feels incredibly empty.

I feel like I'm forgetting all the little things that made her, her. I know memory is fallible, so how I remembered her a year ago is different from how I'll remember her 5 years from now, even if ever so slightly. That thought is scary. I'm racking my brain for the normal moments, but they all feel so shallow and empty. I have all these memories of her, but are missing the depth needed to define her. I wish I could go back and imprint all the inflections from her voice and mannerisms in my head. But how do you remember an entire person?

I wish I could run through my head how she'd react to certain things. I wish I still knew her well enough to do that, but she's been gone for too long for me to do that with any confidence. I'm scared, and sad because my memory of her will become skewed and fuzzier.

40,"You may know the Pogues mostly for their Christmas classic, [Fairytale of New York](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9jbdgZidu8), but their early discography contains many much rougher tracks with lyrical references to all sorts of vices and acts of violence.

This theory concerns the lyrics to a deep cut from the Pogues early days, [Boys from the County Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psTqudN7t1M). In short, this song is about a drunk Irishman searching for a fight, accompanied by his father, mother, brother, and friends. The verse that concerns this argument discusses his ""boys"" that accompany him on this search, and it reads as follows:

&gt; The boys and me are drunk and looking for you

&gt; We'll eat your frigging entrails and we won't give a damn

&gt; Me daddy was a blue shirt and my mother a madam

&gt; And my brother earned his medals at My Lai in Vietnam

Upon first glance, the reference to My Lai may just seem like a random place in Vietnam that serves the rhyming scheme and highlights how his brother isn't someone to be trifled with due to his military service. But after .5 seconds of closer thought, it's clear that this lien is referring to the [Mỹ Lai Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lai_Massacre), a particularly horrific war crime committed by a group of American soldiers during the Vietnam War.

The obvious reading of this lyric is that you shouldn't fuck with the narrators brother because he's a war criminal. This is more likely than not what MacGowan intended when he wrote the lyric, but let's run with it a little bit. The only medals given out to American servicemen during the massacre were medals given to Warrant Officer [Hugh Thompson Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Thompson_Jr.), Specialist [Glenn Andreotta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Andreotta), and Specialist [Lawrence Colburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Colburn) for their role in stopping the massacre. 

Andreotta is described in his Wiki article as being ""of Italian descent"", which is also evident by his surname, so that immediately strikes his out as being the brother of the song's nameless Irish-American narrator. I couldn't find information on Colburn's ancestry, but that surname indicates ancestry in Yorkshire England, not Ireland. That leaves Thompson, who is described in his wiki article as having Cherokee ancestry as well as descending from ""the British Isles"" and later the original English colony in what is now the state of Georgia.

""The British Isles"" is a vague term that includes Ireland, but what really puts the nail in the coffin is the origin of his last name: [Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_\(surname\)). As described in the Wiki article,Thompson is an English translation of the Gaelic surname MacTamhais. Therefore one could imagine that upon hearing of new opportunities in the American colonies, a portion of the MacTamhais family moved from Ireland to England, changed their name to the English Thompson, and set sail to make a new life for themselves in the colony of Georgia.

So we've established that of the three medal recipients from the massacre, the narrator's brother is more likely than not Hugh Thompson Jr. So who does that make the narrator? As described in the Wiki article, Thompson's only sibling was his brother, Thomas Thompson.

**The identity of the narrator of the song ""Boys from the County Hell"" is Thomas Thompson, brother of war hero Hugh Thompson Jr**

So that's all well and good, but let's take it a step further. The song is sung through a first person perspective, but that in no way indicates that this is a story from MacGowan's life. But lets pretend that it did.

Thomas Thompson and his boys are described in the song as being alcoholics, or if not alcoholics then just frequent users, as shown in the lyrics below

&gt; Five green bottles sitting on the floor

&gt; I wish to Christ, I wish to Christ

&gt; That I had fifteen more

&gt; And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink

&gt; And mother wake me early in the morning

MacGowan is well known for his own personal problems with alcohol use, and Hugh Thompson Jr is indicated in his Wiki article to have suffered from alcoholism. Addiction often comes from circumstance. One could assume that the Thompson brothers were in similar circumstances throughout their lives, so one could posit that much like MacGowan, Thomas Thompson was an alcoholic. 

This is an absolutely irrefutable piece of evidence which indicates that Thomas Thompson and Shane MacGowan are the same person. Let's run through the evidence again:

* Both Thompson and MacGowan are of Irish descent

* Both Thompson and MacGowan have denounced racism and discrimination against ethnic minorities (MacGowan through his lyrics and Thompson through his wiki article)

That's it. That's all the evidence I need. This $100% proves that Shane MacGowan is the alter ego of Thomas Thompson, brother of famed war hero Hugh Thompson Jr.

45,"I frequently ask people what kind of music they like either when I'm giving them a ride for the first time, or we are working together for the first time, basically any 'first time' situation that involves me putting on some music.

Stop trying to be polite, I'm asking you a question because I'm trying to accommodate you and you being vague and evasive is just making that more difficult. So usually my follow-up question is ""is there any music you don't like?"" and sometimes people will say they don't like country or rap, but often they won't say anything.

46,"I (30m) was laying awake last night thinking about a lot of things. And it hit me that I might have a addictive personality and I dont know how to deal with it if it's true or how I can tell I really do. 

When do I feel like have this? Around: 
1. Alcohol 
2. Spending 
3. Video games 

Alcohol. In my youth I drank a lot like many others. It often got out of control. Cause once I start I cant stop. I drink til either my drinks or money are all out. I've spent 1500 $ some nights. The constant partying was fueled by me being single and working in restaurants and bars. I no longer and I have a SO. But I still *feel* the thirst, the urge. It can hit me on a weekday and I fight it cause ""holy shit its Tuesday calm down"". But on Fridays I can rarely stop it and I can get smashed by 8pm. Even when I've said to my SO I wouldn't as soon as someone offers an after work I'm all in. (Related? My dad is an alcoholic and drug addict). I know this could be a problem but I dont want to stop it. But I do. But I really dont. I've tried before and it has never lasted more than two weeks. I enjoy drinking too much. The taste and buzz.

Spending. I'm awful with money compared to most others. I still manage to save a decent amount each month but as soon as that paycheck hits I always start spending on unnecessary things. Back in the day it was mostly alcohol. These days its gifts for my SO. And sometimes clothes. It never hurts to spend 2000$ on a gift for my SO but I would NEVER buy myself something that nice, seems like a waste of money. 

Video games. I've been addicted to them in my youth. Flushed down a few years in high school because of it. I went cold turkey a few years ago but I recently bought a Xbox to kill some time before the SO gets home. And I've started feeling the same urge again. ""I should call in sick tomorrow to play games all day"". I havnt yet. But it's always there in the back of my head. 

Does this sound like I might have addiction problems? If so, how can I deal with it? The alcohol one is the one I really wish could go away so I could keep it to a casual ""wine with dinner"" level. ",28Feb2019,42

So Japan,it was fun while it lasted,but sometimes you gotta face reality.

53," I have horrible anxiety and depression, I used to be suicidal, I don’t know if I still am or not. I’ve been doing remarkably better now but despite being kinda ok during the day if I’m left alone at night something changes and I’m not ok anymore. I panic and overthink and obsess about pointless things. I think back to past trauma or mistakes and think if I just did this one thing different it wouldn’t have happened. Since I was a kid, my family has physically and verbally abused me in every possible way. I’m in total denial when I talk about it with others because my coping mechanism is to pretend everything is ok and then sweep it under the rug. But the reality is it’s fucked me up so much and I can’t emotionally handle working through that trauma right now. I kept cutting for a couple years hiding everything from my family and friends, and I still continue. I was in so much mental pain, that I didn’t feel like a person. I don’t know how to describe it. I hated myself so much. When I was 10, I learned what a panic attack was and learned I had been having panic attacks for as long as I can remember. My parents never noticed me being this way, as they were too busy dealing with my sister. Sometimes, instead of instead of cutting I switched to bruising myself or (less commonly) piercing myself. Despite doing a teensy bit better I still feel hopeless at night and some days. If I can’t sleep, which is very often cause of insomnia, something happens and I’m not ok anymore. I don’t want to deal with this pain anymore and I’m scared I’ll never truly escape it despite how far I’ve come. I know I’ll get better. I know I’ll escape this feeling one day. But it just FEELS like I’ll never outrun it. I feel so hopeless and pathetic. Despite doing so much and improving my life by extraordinary amounts I still feel like my actions are worthless. I feel lost even though I have goals. I feel like all my emotions are empty. I KNOW they aren’t. But it feels that way. And I don’t know how to stop this. I just want to be ok. ",28Feb2019,2
54,"The first one is more blatant, so I'll tell it first. These experiences aren't inappropriate, but they're off-color and I'm not likely to forget them. That means they're definitely out of the norm.

I was at the doctor's when I was 18 years old and in college. She had an office on campus so I visited because I was told to, and I gave my information at the desk where a person was waiting in the waiting room. I was having a routine check for testicular cancer, and also my first ever check. The female doctor told me that testicular cancer can develop in adult men so it was important to go to the doctor every once in a while. The doctor, who must have been 35 to 40 years old, bended down on her knees and she felt for cancerous lumps, and told me that I would have to feel for them as well about once a year. When the doctor was examining my private parts she said clearly that she hoped the feeling I had (from her touching me) wasn't too sensitive.

Another time I was in therapy for personal health and in an early session I brought in my fanfiction, as an example to show the female therapist one of the things I did with my time. The therapist asked me point blank if I had written the fanfiction for her. I said no. She clearly was wondering if I was not right, but I simply enjoy fanfiction a lot and I always have since I was young. ",28Feb2019,0
55,"I apologize in advance for this being long, and for any spelling mistakes/ format issues I don't catch. This is mainly just a quick glaze over of my years in this house. If any of you enjoy this story and want to know some stories in more detail let me know in the comments. I'll get to writing some.

Okay to start off here's a bit of background. I moved in with the guardian around when I was 9-10 years old after my mother passed. My mother's adoptive brother wanted to care for me, great man, respect him deeply, this story is not about him, it is about his wife. They had four kids besides me, just for some general information. I'm not with this family anymore, and am happily living on my own. 

We'll call the wife W, M- me, and my mom's brother U, for uncle respectively.

So after moving in with the family, all is going well for the first few years until I start to pick up that I'm not treated the same as the other kids when U is not around. After a little while I realize I'm cleaning and doing more work around the house than the other kids are, I bring this up politely at first to W. She kind of just goes.

M- ""Why do I clean more than the others W?""

W- ""You aren't just now they are taking a break.""

I dismiss it as maybe I'm just being selfish, which was one of my first mistakes after moving in with this family. I find out later that I'm supposedly getting punished, hence why I was cleaning more than the others by asking U. I had no knowledge of what I did and why I'm being punished, later found out that I ""lied"". 

The years go by and I just deal with it, I was just cleaning more and not much else, so I dealt with it and went on with my life. Later things started getting worse, I would go to do my homework after we get homes from school, which is what she told us to do, but no I have to clean first. Her excuse was since I'm smart I can do it later. (I was an above average grade student, not having much you let with my classes and such). I was almost the only one cleaning the house now and if I didn't clean one room, I'd get punished for it. Now I was getting a bit fed up with it, so I spoke up.

M- ""I don't understand why I'm the only one having to clean and not get to do anything but clean when I'm home."" 

W- ""If you behaved yourself than maybe you wouldn't have to be cleaning constantly.""

The argument went on with me not complaining about it and apparently I was constantly lying about things, which is why I was forced to clean all the time. Her get out of me complaining was always that I lied every chance I got. It was overall a shitty time there and when I was finally in my last year's of high school is when it got shitty. Now whenever I complained she would start hitting me when no one was around, pulling my hair, slapping me in the back of her head with my fist, broke several wooden spoons on me, once she even bent a god damn broom against my leg.

So time comes for college, I am so happy to be spending my time in dorms about an hour and a half away from that bitch. 

I started talking to this girl when I was in college, but she lived in my hometown, and this is when shit goes really south. So this girl I'm talking to is apparently the daughter of a babysitter W hired when I was still with my mom. This babysitter apparently tried taking U away from W. This was all unbeknownst to me. So they see one time when I was on break, I came home for a few days, that I was texting her. W told me to stop texting her and break everything off, I said sure, but of course I didn't. Like hell I was going to listen to her after everything she put me through.

So during a weekend I went to visit her place and the new snapchat update with the maps came out and I didn't know about it, I rarely use it. So one of the younger siblings finds out and says they didn't know I was coming back to town to visit. W saw where I was, and for some reason, knew where the babysitter lived, instantly called me up and started bitching me out, saying I needed to come home now, return the car keys, my phone, and at the time I had a bank account, and my credit card, so I did, but not before I packed a wrestling bag, one of those big bags, fill of clothes, shoes, and various other necessities.

I gave them to her and started walking down the driveway as she's screaming at me. She tries to grab me but she's a bit on the bigger side so even with my heavy bag on my back she can't grab me. She said if I walked out the driveway, I wasn't allowed back at the house ever, I waved said goodbye in the happiest voice I've ever had since moving there and walked about an 2 hours to my aunt's. For some context this was around 10 p.m., also the house was out in the country really. I walked into town told her what happened, and I then went back to a buddies house a few hours away, near my school, and I haven't spoken to anyone of them since.

Again, this is just a brief recap of my horrifying 9 years in the household with her, this doesn't make her look as bad, but I have way worse stories of her treating me worse than a garbage bag full of shit.

Hope you enjoyed, 
And thank you.

58,"So really log story short my gf and I have had to move 4 times in 4 months and like I don’t even know how many times in the last 2 years. I had a really sweet that we had until at least September with the option to stay but I was cooking with oil and it caught fire and I had a kitchen fire that I was told will take months to fix so we ended our lease. That was about six weeks ago and we have been staying at a friends apartment that he was generous enough to give us and go stay with his gf during the week and crash on the weekends to help us out. We’ve been in this small apartment with all our shit in boxes and suitcases for 6 weeks after thinking we were finally done with that after doing it for a year and a half. We finally decided to move about 45 mins away to a smaller town, get more for our money, maybe a back yard, a house, guest room etc. 

So we find this place. It’s perfect. We meet with the people renting the place out. It’s a 3 bedroom, they were a couple that were renting from the lender that wanted to share the space with another couple. It has a big kitchen, big open concept, tons of parking, big back yard, 2 sheds, garnering area a fire pit and a fucking hot tub. Rent was super reasonable, a steal really. She tells us we can move in and sign a 6 month lease. We make arrangements to buy and have a bed delivered to this new place ($400CAD) we tell other places we looked at and got approved for that we found a place, we were so excited. This was the best thing that had happened to us since my lifelong best friend passed away 2 years ago. Finally we were going to have a place to maybe settle down for a while and establish ourselves. We had been all over the continent the past year, we were ready to stay out for a while. So we show up to sign the lease and our room mate to be, let’s call her Beth, says that she thinks a month to month lease is best for now and then when their lease is up in 5 months we can just all sign with the home owner. In my head I’m thinking “wait, that wasn’t the deal, I probably would not have agreed to that if that had been the original arrangement.” But at that point there was no turning back, the first of the month is fast approaching and where I live housing is scarce this time of year because it’s near a ski town. We had no other option so I said sure no problem. I was in no position to negotiate. 

So I make a few trips from our old place to our new place, get all the stuff, did i it all by myself while my gf worked. Took a long time and was a pain in the ass as moving always is. This was last night.

I get there and I make some dinner, talk to my gf for a bit, they invite us to watch a tv show, them and a third friend who is staying there for a bit. I barely interact with them. They seem to kind of be keeping their conversation separate from our, kind of not being super engaging, I was like whatever. I might have said like 5 sentences to this girl. Nothing about politics, religion, I don’t even think I really gave much of an opinion about anything. There was one very brief three sentence exchange about Canada’s new weed policy and how I think it’s bullshit but we pretty much agreed on it from what I could tell. We watched tv for a bit, we went to bed, there was no indication that anything was off or weird or whatever. We hug out for maybe 2 hours in total including when we were having dinner and not really talking to them.

I get a text from my gf this morning of a screenshotted text from Beth.


“Hey TJ902’s girlfriend, I was hoping to be able to talk to you earlier but you seem to have a full schedule (she was in the middle of working a double shift) I don’t think our living situation is working out. These things are hard to know
until we’re sharing a space, but my bf and I are used to a more quiet living arrangement, we like a calm environment. I feel like TJ902 comes off as being very intense and I feel quite uncomfortable, which we feel is disrupting our home. I don’t think we’re all a good fit for sharing the space. I think it best if you guys find a new place. I know this is a huge inconvenience (ya think?) but I think it’s best addressed now before you guys get too settled. I’m headed to work but if you want to give me a call between shifts let me know”

Like could y’all imaging getting that text in the middle of working 13 hour day? She just started a new job so my girlfriend is freaking the fuck out around these people she doesn’t really know yet, like our whole fuckin life just got flipped upside down. 

Reddit, I swear to you guys I wasn’t being intense, loud, argumentative, opinionated, I was making extremely benign innocent small talk or just keeping to myself. Even my gf who keeps it real with me when I sometimes do kind of put people off when I say certain things agreed that I did nothing wrong or offensive. She sat down with Beth today while I was at work and she still didn’t give her any specific thing that I said or did just that I “stated my opinions bluntly” and that I was “very opinionated” she wants us out in the next few days. The next few fuckin days! We already signed a lease for the month of March and she’s just trying to put us out on the street. 

I’m flabbergasted. If she was this particular and sensitive about shit she could have tried to get to know us better before signing a lease, had us over for dinner or something. I feel that nothing I said the other night, was a fraction as *intense* as what she is doing here. Like talk about snap irrational decision making. I’m a well liked guy, i got tons of friends and colleagues who would attest to that. I feel she is being extremely cold hearted, judgemental and irrational.

My girlfriend comes to see me at work after their chat. Tells me the news. I say fuck that we’re staying there until we can find a decent place, I’m not about to let this ridiculously sensitive snowflake turn my whole life upside down. I just can’t move again so soon I have no money and we have nowhere to go. I’m not gonna go sleep in a hostel and trust them with our stuff or pay for storage just because she didn’t understand what having a room mate was before signing a legal document. 

My gf says doesn’t want to stay there because it will be so awkward and tense. I say I’m not fuckin moving I have rights I’m not letting this stupid bitch fuck me over. Not only am I staying until the 31st or until I find a *decent* place but I’m also demanding that they give us some rent money back considering we now have to pay movers and stuff. She says fine, see ya. Now I’m thinking this shit might end up costing me my relationship. I’m at work remember, in the back office losing my fucking mind. It’s a busy night on the floor, we have a big celebrity guest, and we had been slow for a while so I really needed this money that I was going to make. I need a minute to go to the bathroom and compose myself. I cry a little. I get back and my manager says we have to get you out of here I’m sorry. Great. More money down the drain. 

I go meet with my gf and we argue. She doesn’t want to stay, I don’t want to move and I also just ain’t the type to let someone fuck me without putting up a fight. I can’t let this girl bully me into sleeping in a hostel because she’s “uncomfortable”. I also have zero reason to trust that if I leave our shit at the house they won’t just get rid of it if it suits them. I really do think that Beth is a complete psychopath. 

She says fine, get the fuck out of my car. I do. I slam the door. I go cry some more. We call and make up and drive home.

I get pulled over! Like I swear to fucking god I’m not making this up. It’s snowing and didn’t realize how fast I was going, I’m doin 83 km/h in a 60. Thankfully he let me off with a warning. Could have fined me $200. At least one thing does go my way.

Anyways my gf and I now agree that we can’t just rush into another lease for a place we don’t like or can barely afford just because this person wants to be super unreasonable. 

The crazy thing is that she had to know that we weren’t going to just magically be able to find a place for March first, today was already the 27th, so we’re probably going to have to stay here the month anyways so she could have given me a little bit more of a chance like damn. She could have brought it up with me like a mature adult and I would have been more than receptive. Sometimes people don’t know if they’re making someone uncomfortable, I don’t want to be that guy but I also have a personality and don’t want to be one of these super reserved uptight people, like she seems to be. I really have no idea what I did or said to make her feel that way. Like I said we barely even interacted and it was all just about nothing much.

I am just at a complete fuckin loss. I have had the worst luck for some time and I was finally happy for all of one evening all for it to be taken away. I feel like I’m being fucked over for no good reason and I’ve been trying so hard to make it work out here and I just keep spinning my wheels.

I swear on my life every word of this shit is true. You really can’t make this shit up. Thanks for reading this super long post. I hope things will get better  and we find a better place, April first is when a lot of places become available, I’m tryin to think positive but holy fuck have I had an absolute mind punch cock kick ass ram of a day.

59,"Anxiety, stress, and depression can take the joy out of life. In a lot of cases, taking control over breath (read: paying attention to breath) can be so helpful in taking control of anxiety; especially social anxiety.

It’s so simple, yet such an underrated technique. If you get social anxiety then this technique is a must try. What’s there to lose anyway - the breath is yours. It’s not like you are paying for it :-)

Taking control of breath can be of great help in dealing with such situations, as it keeps you more present and alert **(mindful)**. Simply put, lack of oxygen in brain causes not only dizziness, but also anxiety, which is one of the biggest social challenges.

64,"I'd like to preface by saying: I am not an amazing artist. I am in art school, and am learning my way. I can't draw characters to save my life, but it's all about learning, making mistakes, and improving. 

So... You've always had a a pipe dream of becoming an artist? That's what everyone always tells me.

So, my question is, what's stopping you?

Fear? I'm sure as fuck scared. I worry about job security and getting good enough to even get a job in the first place. This thing takes years. It takes thousands of hours upon hours upon hours. You're right to be scared, but what makes you different from ""actual"" artists? Formal training, years worth of work? But then why is that 11 year old kid who started drawing a year ago an artist, and you'll still never be one? It's just not true. You'll come to a point when other people start to call you an artist. I still don't like to call myself one, because I still fear I'm not good enough. 

Speaking of that, you're not good enough?  Yeah, I thought that too. Your drawings are better in your head than they are on paper? What makes you think that ever changes? I have probably 500+ hours in my field of study, and everything comes out better in my head than on the page. It's frustrating. But it comes with the area.

You're too old? No. You're not. 

You don't have enough time? I have an advantage, yes. I go to classes 24 hours a week, then I use my free time when I'm not working my 20 hour a week job to work on school work. *THIS IS ALL I DO*. It's all I've ever wanted to do. I go home and I want to draw. I go to school and I want to draw. I wasn't always like this. I was scared, I didn't have time, I was too late to start again. If you love something, you change your circumstances or make time. Even if that time is three hours per week, it's better than zero.

You don't have the equipment? Do you own a pencil? Do you own paper? Then yes, you do. You don't need a sketchbook. You don't need oil paints and a canvas. Just pick up your pencil and draw a circle.  You're going to be bad, but you're starting. Don't get a drawing tablet for digital art right away. Learn traditional for a while. Otherwise it's going to be extremely discouraging. Digital *is* extremely difficult for a beginner. 

You don't have talent? God, I hate when people tell me I have talent. Look, neither do I. I wasn't born drawing. My parents actively discouraged it. I only really spent time doing art in high school. I went to university for two years, then switched into college for my art related field. I work on my art around 30, to 60 hours a week. I have gotten good because I've pushed myself, because I spent time. I'm as talented as you are. I just decided to start. 

To close off, stop telling me excuses. Stop telling me I'm talented and you're not. If you want to be an artist, you can be. It's not up to me, but I can be here to encourage you.

I went to bed at 11 hoping to get some sleep. I thought it would be great bc everyone was out partying and I was told no one would be home all night.

I can feel my bed and table vibrating. No headphones or earphones, no one respecting my requests to turn it down.

This has been going on for almost every night since last Thursday. These parties can last up until 4am in the morning. I live with an RA but he's the one turning the music louder. So frustrating that I can't go to bed until they do (I don't fall asleep fast either so there goes another hour) and then when I wake up at 11am tired they look at me like ""you can't be tired, you didn't even go out"". Oh gee, I wonder why I'm tired.

I'm not a fan of partying. I do like sitting around playing cards with a few friends and some drinks, but that's about it. I can't go out on the town and get progressively wasted over 5-8hrs. Also, I can't do it more than 2 days in a row at most. So, these parties are just not enjoyable. Regardless, I still have to deal with the aftermath. It sucks having to live with party animals.",28Feb2019,1

71,"I have recently moved to NY by myself after a very physically and emotionally demanding period of my life.

I a 22 years old male and moved to the US from a developing country around 3 years ago to find better opportunities. All part of very long and carefully layout “master plan” that I had as a kid. Incredibly, I achieved the goal in my plan after 9 years. I am in New York and am attending my dream school, all as I planned. 

The years before this, I worked my ass off, sometimes doing 90 hr-weeks of work of manual labor and junior college, averaging 30,000 steps a day to go to school, and navigating a completely different culture. My stress levels were constantly maxed out, but my motivation (or stubbornness) was always stronger, and could really do anything. I felt almost indestructible. However, I feel like I lost myself in the process. That I became almost like a robot. 
Two of those three years, I have been in a relationship. Quickly, our dynamic became codependent. Me doing all the “adulting” and most of the times her battling with her depression. It was pointed out to me that I always kept myself emotionally closed, and my partner never really saw me cry. I always said that I just couldn’t give myself the luxury to be emotional, or everything, including us, would fall apart. Some months ago, this started to change. Having to move to NY became a reality, and many things happened since then between us, mainly about loyalty... This had a great effect on my own views of morality and emotional stability. 

Now I am in a better situation. I am not exhausting myself like before. But I feel empty and lonely. We are doing a long distance open relationship, as we are young and want to explore but not lose what we have. This definitely adds up to the mix. But even though this plays an important role, it is way more than that. I am sad and my motivation is just almost not there. I am trying to slowly go back to do the things I loved before I embarked this journey: Music, art, sports, etc. But I don’t even know who am I without chasing a goal or a set of tasks anymore. I understood that maybe I needed new goals, bigger ones even. But they all seem pointless, even though my rational mind knows they are not. Even looking back to what was achieved looks this way.

I have been always super outgoing. I was lead singer in a punk rock band for a long time back in my country, and I spent a lot of time in leadership positions, political rallies, advocacy, etc. I have never been afraid to speak out and just go for it, never really cared about what was thought of me. Yet, now I just can’t. I feel socially anxious around people, spend most of my time alone, can’t even speak properly sometimes. I used to go on periods of time were I would work out a lot and end up super fit before (on the skinny side of things). Now, I have probably lost like 20 lbs, and I just don’t have the energy to go back to a new eating and working out routine. I have been able to keep an schedule, going to bed and waking up at the same time every day. I have found that helps me. But overall, I just don’t know what should I be really doing. I am trying to launch a business so I don’t have to do so many shitty jobs any more. Even though, I would probably have to get something part time to get me through. But the energy and will are just not there. 

I understand I must give myself the chance to be tired and be sad, but what after? I just don’t feel happy. I didn’t before, and I don’t now either after all this work. I keep digging on my own self to understand what is happening. I find a lot of negative behaviors I engage with, like being overly critical on other people choices but at the same time I just don’t care about other people choices. Or thinking that this is just the result of a broken heart and trying to mend things over on a long distance relationship, but then I understand that this is way beyond a relationship, more of a superhero complex from my part. Or that my parents really fucked me up and had a lot of pressure put on me by being the oldest brother of 4 in a poor broken family. But at the end, this is about who I am now. I know who I want to be, maybe not sure about how or doing what, but I am clear I want to be compassionate, grateful, and inviting in all aspects of my life. I don’t want to be a narcissistic prick and I feel people sees me like that sometimes, and even if they did, why do I care so much all of the sudden!? Is it because I should care? I just feel lost, lonely, and empty, and every small win seems like nothing. I definitely cry a lot now hahah, which I guess is good? Suicidal thoughts have come through my mind many times, but I am CERTAIN, I would never act on them. I even had a “Christmas Carol” type of dream 2 days ago where I died. I don’t know how I feel about that.

It is quite an existential crisis and am taking the steps to get a therapist (healthcare is chaos in this country), as I know I don’t have all the answers. But from now, I spend so much time in Reddit, as I don’t have (or want to have) social media, that I was hoping to see if someone has gone through something similar, or any advice or support you might kindly provide me. If you made it this far from after this long rant, I really appreciate your time. Thank you folks.

TL;DR: Achieved big goal, now feel sad and lonely instead of happy.",28Feb2019,8

She said I’m almost done with high school and to not stress about college yet. She said to quit my job &amp; then reapply when I’m done with hs. Then she said everyone gets stressed out from time to time. 

I don’t want her to think I’m crazy so I’m not telling her about how I really feel. I know she’ll only react negatively. I don’t know what to do now. I really wanted to go to therapy because I feel that I need the help. I used to use marijuana to block the negative feelings and it would help. Now I feel that it doesn’t help at all.

81,"a little bit of backstory: first of all, i'm kevin and i'm 17; and the girl is carly, 16.

We first met 5 years ago on instagram: She made a post and asked for people's numbers to join a random groupchat in which we could talk about anime, video games, etc etc: I joined and it felt really good, making some really good friends and having people that care about you was a new thing to me.   Me and Carly were really REALLY good friends, and i even liked her for a long period, but just couldn't do anything because of the distance (we both live in italy, 350km away from eachoter), and kept on with our friendship: Until one day she told me that we couldn't talk anymore because she didn't really feel like going on with internet friendships, and bla bla bla; i just said ""ok, if that makes you feel better go on, i'll be here if you need me"", and so she left.

a year later she texts me and tells me that she's sorry for her behaviour, and i told her that it was ok and there's nothing to worry about, because friends, right?? i was furious. but that didn't matter.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this summer: it's june, i just got a job as a barman with very long and strict hours but only for 3 days a week (they gave me a house in the city i worked in, which was away from my real home), and guess what? she was in vacation near my town for 3 weeks.

during that period, we texted literally every day at every hour, nonstop: i fell in love with her and she loved me too, i knew because of how she acted, and i just felt it. until one night, while i was drunk, i texted her and told her how much i loved her and how i cared for her; when i woke up in the morning, she told me that she liked me too and that we should meet as soon as possible.

and so we met for the first time, after 5 years knowing eachother:

i saw her and i felt WEAK.

she. was. stunning. i fell in love even more after that first encounter. 

the first date went really well, we talked and joked and i knew she was the one, altough we decided not to get into a relationship since we lived far away and we would get hurt, and we both agreed on that.

second date: went normal, and in the end we finally decided to not get into anything although we talked about our feelings.  Later in the afternoon i texted her: ""i'm happy that we worked out but... i would've loved to steal a kiss from you"" and she replied with: ""mmhh... me too. how about i give you one tomorrow?"" hell yeah. i'll have that.

third date: we were chilling, laying down in a park and i told her: ""hey, don't forget about the kiss you owe me!"" and she replied: ""do you want it now?"" and we kissed.

In that moment, all my crippling anxiety, all my teen depression, all my fears disappeared. i have NEVER felt so happy before. it was a magical day.

days go by, i love her more everyday,i sacrificed all my free days to stay with her for as long as i could... i woke up at 6 am so that i could be with her until 5pm and then go to work... and it felt really good to matter to someone like that. 

But the days had to end. at the end of the week she'd have to go back to milan...

we did foreplay (she was new to this stuff but looked really eager to it, while it wasn't my first time doing foreplay) and, on the last day, \*\*we had sex. it was the first time for both of us.\*\* we say goodbye to eachoter with a passionate kiss and telling eachoter ""I love you""; i even left her a legend of zelda notebook with a handwritten note by me, she was really really happy. but we agreed to stay friends now that it's over.

days flew by... she was in a countryside where her internet didn't work and so we couldn't talk at all... and we lost a bit of contact.

she then came back in milan. great! we can talk now!

well guess what? she didn't want to talk to anyone because her dog died, her friend's mother died, etc etc and a bunch of other stuff all together. i gave her some space and after 1 week of mutism i raged at her because she just acted like nothing happened at all, and she made me feel like shit. she just didn't act like she was a friend anymore... i just told her to fuck off and i never texted her back.

she texted me on my birthday, to which i replied with a sad ""thanks"", and on christmast, which i didn't reply to.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is that i think that i still like her... but i don't want to text her because i feel bad just thinking about her (i can feel happy only when she isn't on my mind), what do i do? i've been waiting 7 months to post this... i hoped that it would fix itself.",28Feb2019,2

I wonder what I would do, if I had to move out in a week.  Where would I go? I have family but, let's just say I like not living too close to them.  I have some money saved so I could pay a few months rent np but I would need to make some money soon after that.  It feels so overwhelming trying to decide what to do with my life from scratch.

I don't think anything further is going to come out of it. We've hardly talked since then and when we do it's only short bursts. Tuesday we were supposed to hang out, but I didn't want to seem clingy so I waited until she responded to my text from the night before to give her the details, but that text never came in.

Yesterday I was super bummed that she didn't text me and I figured maybe she was waiting for me to come through with the plans so I looked like a jackass never saying anything so I sent her a text saying that was stupid of me and that I hoped we could still talk and hang out again sometime. She responded back and we were texting back and forth for maybe an hour and then once again, radio silence. Haven't talked to her today because like the other day, I don't want to pester her and drive her away. 

I think I'm going to just let her do her thing. I know she's going out of town so maybe she's caught up in that right now and can't be bothered with me, which is totally understandable. Maybe when she comes back I'll ask if I can take her to dinner or something. 

Just kind of sucks because I thought we really hit it off and this was the first time in a long time that I felt a certain way about someone. We only met twice, but god damn, she's so cool. 

All of my friends just keep telling me ""yeah man, this is going to happen, sorry"" and while they're not wrong, it just doesn't really make me feel any better. I've gone on several dates with women, but to me those were just kind of fun ways to kill time and see if there was a spark between us. This was the first time I felt a spark since I got out of three year relationship last May. 

I'm just ready to be connected with someone again and that shit is so hard, dude. I was talking to one of my friends who doesn't go to college and was explaining to him how much harder it is to date in college than in high school. In college you're just kind of a serial number, everyone is on their own path, and doesn't communicate to the person next to them unless it's absolutely dire.
