0,"I used to be a full time student taking night shifts and double weekend shifts. I couldnt go home cause my family member would have substance fueled episodes often ending with the police coming to our door. 

I was miserable then, and I didnt know what I was after. 

I dropped out and lost hope for a while. Ended up landing myself in an abusive relationship and losing all my confidence. 

Eventually I just said fuck it and went full force on a new chance for school. I pursued my passion for graphic design against all odds and lack of secondary education in my field.

Made way more money freelancing doing what I love most and networking. I was in print before I knew it across Petco and some other pet store retailers, which blew my mind and bought me a new pair of shoes. 

I somehow landed a job at an organization full of the people who genuinely care. I also just started a clothing label that gives back to the homeless which I'm absolutely wild about. 

Above all,  theyve just moved me over to be part time at the creative office! I plan to get a job in the action sports industry and now I'm learning all the programs I need to pursue it / gather references.

1,"She needlessly says things like “he used to bully his little brother all the time he’s was a bit of trouble as a child” and whenever she’s around my friends she’s like “oh he’s not a peoples person”, in high school she would tell all my teachers how I avoided people and never went out. 

It seems like to her saying these things to COMPLETE STRANGERS (to her) is just a normal conversation? She doesn’t seem to even BEGIN to think something is wrong with that. 

Honestly I’m on edge every time she’s with me. Always worried she’s going to talk about my short comings with people who are my friends who are complete strangers to her. She just thinks this is normal.",10Jul2019,1
2,"So my girlfriend and I been dating for a little bit but i feel like i could get a better girlfriend off of her. My girlfriend when i meet with her she is mostly on her phone watching a video or reading a story. She is mostly with her sister and i just feel left out sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend always watches these videos that are like storys but they are more like the go animate anime type. They are trash content and i try to talk to her but sometimes its really hard to talk to her because she never initiated a conversation with me. I never get to spend that much time as i need to with her because most of the day she is at her phone. She is a weeabo but i am very open minded. It is just sometimes hard to talk with her without cringing at the fact that she just says a random anime character.

&amp;#x200B;

And her sister i really dislike, this sister is the youngest of the bunch and i just really dont like her. Shes pushy excruciatingly cringey at times. And just out right mean. She can sometimes act like a child and be really unfunny and stupid and then she can be outgoing mean and just painful to talk to. She mostly initiated conversations with her sister and when my girlfriend says something about me being cute. Her sister just completely disagrees with her point and says  some japanese term i do not understand. About me being ugly and stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes when they talk about which japanese character is hotter i feel left out and not in the conversation because I just dont know what it means and they never really go on a actaul conversation. When i try to initiate a normal conversation. My girlfriend is mostly anti social about it and she is kinda iffy about what i am talking about. Atleast she is never like talking about anime towards me but its just to each other. And when they talk about gravity falls or something (a show that i actaully know) and i just say something about it her sister just yells at me. She even yelled at me for saying Weirdmageddon wrong. When she pronounces it Weird Mag-na-gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today i tried talking to her, but she said she was not in a talking mood. Even though she is always talking to her sister. And then one time when i talk to her. Her sister said ""I thought you are not in a talking mood"" she said ""Yeah i am not but SOMEONE IS TALKING TO ME"" in a very mean manner. She knows that i am hyper sensitive and i really dont like when my lover starts yelling at me. Even if its unjustified. I almost started a arguement but if that happens it will make people think that we are not a good couple. If it was just the 3 of us then i would get a piece of mind on her. But i couldn't. Before that i sent her a text last night about that you can get through some problems and how much i loved her. I talked to her today about it. She just said ""Oh yeah i just went through everyone's text without reading them to get out the notifications."" As the hyper sensitive kid i was i had a mental breakdown. Luckily i did it in the bathroom not infront of her and her sister.

&amp;#x200B;

And with all of these problems i feel like i could get someone better instead of her. I cannot stand in such stress to get through her sister and her phone just to try to talk to her for literally 10 minutes. Its hard and its sometimes back breaking. I love her but its just that i cannot stand her surroundings and i cannot stand when shes always on her phone. I feel like i could get a better woman. Is this bad? Am i being a dickhead of the situation? And if i do get someone, Would it be for the best of me?

3," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

5,"So i have this course, but at the same time this scholarship that pays me for being there but at the same time I’m part of the school staff, does that make sense? Anyway, my scholarship group had to be there before and after the course begin and end, the course ended and everyone in my 20 students class left but my scholarship group of 4 people.

On this small group there was a guy who I found attractive at first but as time went on he became my friend and as I got to know him better I developed a crush.

I can’t even explain in words the kind of person he is, I’m an introvert and he got me out of my shell, he made sure I was comfortable, even when I didn’t told him he noticed made everything to make me feel included and good.
He was very touchy and he used a picture of us as his freaking screensaver.
He has a rough past and still became the amazing person that he is today, I really admire him.

Anyway, enough of the gushing, now the sad part.

After the course was over we were given a period of time to figure out what we were going to do next, meanwhile we help with paper stuff on the school and materials for the next generation.

Today I arrived and he wasn’t there, i waited for him but he never came, then we got the news that he’s not coming anymore, he found something better.

I’m happy for him, but it was a really sad day for me, today felt empty and lonely, even though I do get along with the others he added so much light to the room, I don’t know how to explain it but he was the biggest piece that kept us together, he was the life of the party and it’s not going to be the same without him.

Also I’m sorry for venting here but I’m really sad and I don’t want to tell this to anyone because I’m scared of sounding pathetic.",10Jul2019,1
6,"I don’t know where this stemmed from but I usually care SO much what people think of me. Even strangers on the internet. I like to write and I share some of my thoughts on social media and sometimes I get a lot of backlash and sometimes I connect with people over things I write. I stopped expressing myself when I realized that some people started to “not like” or agree with me, I hated to feel like someone thought poorly of me. And then I don’t know what happened but I just decided I didn’t care anymore. I try to only care what my family and close friends think but anybody else I just think, fuck it. Not everyone has to like or agree with me, doesn’t make me a shitty person. It just means I don’t place value on people that I don’t know when it comes to speaking my mind. (I’m not at all saying I don’t care about people in general and they should all fuck off, lol).

It has been a week since I was let go of my job. It came to a surprise to me since I had done nothing wrong but the company had made up their mind about letting me go. 

With each minute that goes by I get more stressed and anxious. I don’t know how I’m going to pay the bills. Rent, car note, insurance, utilities, even for groceries. I don’t know what I’m going to do. 

I’ve been searching for job since the moment I was fired. I still haven’t gotten a call back from any place. I’ve applied to dozens of jobs and nothing.

9,"Some backstory: My parents were married for 13 years and during that time there was heavy drug use and domestic violence. They were ""using buddies"" or whatever the term is. They eventually got divorced, with my father being better off due to having a steady job, with my mother on her own. Of course I know that they've both fucked up in their own ways, its just that my father was able to bounce back quicker. 

Backstory over

These last few weeks have been hell for her recently. I just moved to a new state, so I haven't been able to physically be there for her. 

She's been living in my fathers trailer for the past 2-3 years. During that time, my brother (20, special needs), my significant other and myself have lived there. In the beginning, the only reason why he was ok with her living there, was because I was. I was under the assumption that he would continue to be om with it from conveesations that I've had with him. I guess not.

All of us, besides her, have fleed the hell hole that is that trailer. The ceiling was caving in, the back room was uninhabitable due to mold growing everywhere, the electric wiring was wack, the wated was fucked, everything that could go wrong in a house did. 

After I moved out, my father had an ""episode"" - basically an undetermined period of time where he's incrediably angry at someone and irrational. My mother is usually the viticm of these episodes and as a result her mental health has declined seriosuly. She's tried to commit suicide several times - with all of the attempts occuring while living in the trailer. 

In the span of the last few weeks, he's evicted her. Leaving her homeless, ontop of already being jobless (this trailer was in a very rural part of TX, and since we couldnt afford to get her a car, she couldn't get a job. The poverty cycle is a bitch). 

I've managed to help her secure a room in a sober living home. With the new job that I have now, I was able to pay a security depost and 2 weeks worth of rent for her.

She just moved in today and I can already tell a difference in her voice and attitude. She's happy. I. Just got off the phone with her and to quote ""I forgot what it was like to have clean floors or AC. I just got so used to it [trailer] that I thouhht it was normal"". 

I wanted someone to tell, but I thought strangers on the internet would be better. Congratulations if you've made it this far in my post. English isn't my second language, I just suck at it.",10Jul2019,2
10,"Hello Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to get this off my chest in the hopes of maybe finding an answer to myself. So here it goes.

For a little context, I am a 25 year old male who is Hispanic. I'm by no means ugly but I would be rated as a 7.5 on the physical attraction scale. I don't speak Spanish nor do I engage in Spanish culture simply for the fact that I have been exposed to American/White culture my whole life. From Video games to just about anything. I currently work two part-time jobs in an office, one for a college and another for suit-tailoring business; both of which don't pay very well so I make the equivalent of 13/hr on my combined incomes. I live at home with my mom who is going away for a month to rehab for her drinking problems. I have a new car that I'm making payments on in which I owe $18k. I graduated from college with a BS in Information Technology as of Dec, 2018. I should also note that I have ADHD.

For the longest time, as far back as I can remember, I have always been socially awkward. I struggled to make friends in school with the exception of High school. College was a complete failure in developing meaningful relationships with new people that I had hoped would carry over to my post-graduate years. I would sometimes sit and wonder what makes me so unlikable; hell when I started dating my first adult gf in college, I was greeted by nothing but contempt from her family/friends because I was not super drop-dead attractive, not from the same culture, not from the same religion, or even the same educational level. I was pretty much made to feel inferior and be seen as the antagonist in some way or another. 

I tried to be nice and polite and tried to initiate a conversation in the hopes of developing a friendship but it seems to have the opposite effect. Though to be honest, as of today when we approach our 4 years together, my girlfriend's friends accepted me for who I am and no longer hold a negative opinion of me. Her family however does seem to hold some level of grudge against me, though this was my fault because of how poorly I handled my emotions and chose my words last year when serious problems came up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I always had the shit-end of the stick when it came to finding jobs, even decent jobs that paid a decent wage. And to this date, I can't even find a serious, well-paying, full-time job to get my life started because of how useless I am. My work experience is basically bullshit fast food, retail, sales, and most recently, office jobs. I tried to find internships but I never found any and even tried unpaid. I have put an exhausting effort to make something happen. My girlfriend is starting to think less of me because she is seeing that my life is stagnant and that I have weak social skills. Please don't talk harshly about her though, because a lot of what she says makes sense and its painfully true. She does love me and puts her part in this relationship but eventually if things don't get better on my end, I'm afraid I'll lose her.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate coming off as unlikable and dislike how I seem standoffish, as if the world is out to get me in some way. I'm watching videos on YouTube to hopefully help me find ways to better myself while also seeing my doctor to get myself back on the medication for my ADHD just so I can function. I stopped taking medication by the time I hit 8th grade because I hated how it made me too quiet, so I got off it to help me socialize more and take risks, which resulted in me making friends and even becoming popular for a time in high school. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to feel normal. I want people to like me and I want to make friends on my side, rather than making friends from my girlfriend's side. I don't this lonely, dull existence in my life anymore because I shouldn't be this way. I hope that if anyone reading this is able to relate and was able to find a way to overcome this, please tell me. I welcome all advice no matter how brutal the truth may be.

13,"(17M) First post on reddit; been browsing for a few weeks through multiple subreddits and felt compelled to post about this intriguing subject. FYI I am in no way, shape, or form arguing. I am simply trying to start a discussion. 

To start, what is self-awareness? I define it on two levels: personal and social. In my experience, being personally self-aware is the ability to comprehend one’s own thoughts, emotions, decisions, or motives. The easiest example I am able to give is purely situational: falling in love with someone and knowing, at any point, that you’re “in love.” At that point you become aware of your own feelings/ emotions. With my limited vocabulary I am only able to describe it so vaguely. Social self-awareness is a bit different, I think. Similar to personal, It’s awareness of one’s outward actions and their effects on relationships / people; being able to objectively look at a situation that the person being “aware” is a part of. Example: argument with a friend; being able to take a step back, evaluate the situation, and knowing who’s “in the wrong” according to modern ethics/ standards (purposely putting feelings aside). Those are my definitions. Simplified, as I can not find the words to express my thoughts. I’m sure many people can expand upon and correct me, but I will continue nonetheless. 

There’s one question I wonder about a lot: “Is everyone capable of being self-aware?” I‘ve seen a lot of stories here about mentally/ physically abusive relationships; lies and betrayals; blatant disrespectfulness towards others. Then there’s an entire field of criminals - murderers, predators, rapists, and so on. Are all these people “self-aware?” When someone tells a story of abuse, is the abuser “aware” that they are abusing; are they aware their actions are immoral and hurtful? Are cheaters able to weigh the consequences of cheating and the stability of their relationships before-hand? Are murderers (w/ the exception of self defense) “aware” that they are taking a human life - a life filled with a family and relationships, with history and future - are they “aware” they are ending all of it?

I think for all those who don’t fit the categories above, we all have some obligatory “rules” ingrained within is; whether it’s due to religion, morals, or simply the law. But at what point does it psychology become “okay” to cross the boundaries and break these rules? Or rather, are such decisions consciously made or are they purely emotional impulse?

Someone I used to talk to years ago (we’ll call them A) was completely normal when I knew them. A was aware of laws, rules, “right” and “wrong”. Fast forward a couple of years, probably some bad combination of life choices and association with the wrong people turned A into some sort of an “addict.” Currently, A’s reputation has degraded, and A’s family is very brittle. A was diagnosed with depression, and threatens to kill themself if A does not get what A wants, in seriousness. Family is forced to comply, allowing the craziest events (vandalism, non-supervision, drug parties, etc) just to prevent A from suicide. If you looked at A years ago, you would not think they would turn into such a person. Yet, A has apparently tested the limits, and is allowed successful manipulation due to a lack of a will to live.

Cases such as above, filled with frustration from other people, makes me wonder what the turning point was. At what point did A’s change occur, and are they actively aware of their actions and how inappropriate such actions are? 

I find social psychology very interesting and I’d like to hear other people’s thoughts.

14,"After a very chaotic few months of my life, where I would get home every day and cry myself to sleep, neglecting homework, responsibilities, friends, family, and myself, I finally feel like I am getting my act back together.

As of the middle of June, I was finally able to be stable without antidepressants. After attempting suicide twice in April and once in May, I feel like I have a bit more of a grip on my emotions, and looking back, I am glad my attempts were not full-hearted, as there has been so much to experience in the last few months, I would regret it if I haven't.

18,"I’m 22, recently graduated with my bachelor’s in neuroscience and psychology. I spent two years of my time as an undergrad involved in research. I’ve spent the last few years debating whether I should pursue either a clinical or research route for my further education. 

Now, this is where I let myself down. I’ve never had any clinical experience whatsoever until I started my new job a month and a half ago. I work at a psychiatric hospital in an inpatient unit. I work with people who are there for severe struggles - self-harm, eating disorders, borderline, depression, anxiety, trauma, etc. I blindly assumed I could handle this kind of environment. Somehow, I could only imagine the positives of this opportunity before I started. Naïve, I know.

Now that I’m in it full-time, I feel so extremely overwhelmed. I feel like it consumes me, even when I’m not at work. When I go home at night and on the weekends, I feel stressed and anxious about anticipating my next shift. I can’t let go of it, no matter how much I try to distract myself or relax. I see kids at their most vulnerable - whether that’s in the midst of a panic attack, self-harming in the bathrooms, purging their food, crying, screaming, resisting treatment, the list goes on and on. 

I thought I could handle this but frankly, I don’t think I can. And that makes me feel like a failure. Like I wasted four years of education on something I can’t even do. I go home and want to cry from stress and having to hold up this persona of being a strong and unaffected person all day when inside, I’m an anxious mess on the verge of breaking down (which is ironic, but also I should’ve expected this). I don’t even get a lunch break, we’re expected to eat lunch with our patients. We get paid only slightly above minimum wage and only get 3 holidays because it’s inpatient care. So I feel exploited in some ways, but I know this field is oversaturated so I’m not surprised. I’m introverted also, so not being able to have time to myself, even for 30 mins, makes it so much more mentally exhausting. 

I know there’s still other career paths available and more jobs to apply to that I could enjoy, but this feels like a huge road block. I want to quit because I genuinely cannot see myself ever getting comfortable or being happy here. But of course, I have to find another job first.

I got super angry and woke her up yelling “wtf is this?! Are you cheating on me?!” She seemed confused and then her eyes widened like she was just becoming aware of the situation.  She then explained to me after a few minutes of silence that she only messaged him because she was afraid to say “no” to people. That the guy from work was sexually harassing her and she was scared. I told her if that was the case then to stop messaging him and leading him on. That’s still no fucking excuse to flirt with someone else. My heart hurts. It’s late.

20,"Whiting Iowa is a tiny little town of less than 1000 people in western Iowa. The most notable thing about here is that the movie ""Children of the Corn"" was filmed here(I can point out many of my highschool teachers and various other locals who served as extras in the film). Growing up I never felt like I truly fit in, not that I was an outcast or anything just more along the lines of not having much in common with anyone. My middle and highschool years where particularly rough on me and I swore up and down I would never return here. 

However, life has a way of turning things upside down. After two and a half years at a local private college in a nearby city I dropped out due to a myriad of problems. College really opened up a whole new world for me my artsy and more  effeminate nature was not discouraged as it was growing up and I felt free to experiment with different forms of expressing myself through performing in theatre, writing music, and at one point being the world's worst drag queen and was a stripper for a hot minute. I made all sorts of wonderful friends from countless different walks of life permanently altering my world view and molding me into an all around more empathetic and caring person.

 College was not all sunshine and self discovery. It was also a dark period for me at times. Dissatisfaction with my choice of study, a few months of homelessness, and years of untreated mental health issues caused me to spiral my junior year and ultimately landed me with two separate trips to the psychiatric hospital within a month. For my own well being I knew I had to take a break from school. 

After I quite school I went and stayed with a friend in Florida for a week and the experience was inspiring. It was the first time I truly realized with my own eyes that there is a world beyond my front door and the family I stayed with were so emotionally supportive and beautiful it inspired me to do something big, something drastic, something my parents, friends, or extended family would understand. I was going to work hard save as much money as I could and then hop in my car and roadtrip the states couch hopping with family and friends who had moved out of state.

I worked hard all winter and all spring at a particularly crummy job at a warehouse putting in six days a week. I sold off all my belongings of value, I stopped eating and going out and I accumulated as much money as I could before my lease on my apartment would be up and I would set off on my greatest adventure.

 But then I got sick, really sick. I managed to get the flu, mono, and strep throat at the same time, I dropped 15 pounds because my tonsils swelled to the point where I couldn't eat not drink and I spent a week in the hospital with IV fluids and antibiotics. I was sick for almost the entire month of June, one month before my lease was up Between not working and a slew of unexpected expenses my savings had vanished. My roommate had already lined up a new person to take up my vacancy so now I am back here, in the town I swore off for good, broke and with no idea what I am going to do next.

I was in denial, but recently I haven’t been eating. I’m just not hungry. Nothing tastes good. Nothing has tasted good for a few days. I looked up loss of appetite on web md and clicked on depression as a cause and I realized I still fit all those descriptions.

So why am I feeling depression?

I’m not going to sugarcoat it, I know the stem of it is from a bad relationship, that ended Months ago. 

And I know that the relationship was toxic and bad and no good for me. Hell, the breakup wasn’t even that bad.
 
Everything else in my life is good and this tiny little thing has my back against the wall, sad, emotional, and a little angry. 

How can I understand my situation, but i’m unable to shake it? 

Am I the only one that feels this way?

I’ve read the self help books. I’m pretty proficient in self-help. I exercise. I relax. I attempt to meditate. But something always happens at the end of these relaxation/letting go sessions where I just talk myself back to the shitty situation. I want to be better and get over this! More than anything! I don’t want to harbor resent and anger! I’m a happy go lucky positive person but oh my fuck am I conflicted. it takes one thing, one thought, and i’m triggered.

23,"Firstly, I am not a native english speaker and I am not good at english. I hope you can understand my problem and help me. 

In my country (in europe) medical school takes 6 or 7 years after high school. And too hard to get into most of medical schools. You need to be good at math and science. Also it is most competitive degree to get into. I am student at one of best medical schools of my country. I was good at math and science (like physics, chemistry, biology etc.) in high school. I always wanted to become scientist. And I thought studying medicine is best way to become scientist. Because there are many scientists with MD degree. There are many physicians with nobel medicine prize. And their discoveries save lifes. Being doctor is prestigious. Also the mean salary of doctors is not bad. So I thought med school is good for me but I was wrong. It is  a complete disappointment. It is just memorization a lot of information. I hate anatomy, biology etc. Studying for exams gives me depression. I find medicine easy to understand but too much information to learn and recall. I realize that I'm not interested in biology. I lost all respect for biology/medicine and being doctor. And I started to think that computers can replace human doctors easily. I surprise that how they didn't replace so far. 

I realize that I'm more interested in math/physics and engineering. I want to leave medicine for it but some parts of me want to believe I am wrong. I don't want to lose 2 years for nothing, I know I am young but I feel too late. Also I am afraid of being wrong again. I don't want to take risk. I don't know what I want anymore. I don't know what I should  do. I don't want to continue my medical edication but also I don't want to leave. I lost my father and we are not a rich family it is also hard for my family.

When I say I hate medicine, people are surprising. Because most of people think being a doctor is hard but worth it.  I don't think that. Not anymore. A stupid job full of memorization of useless things. Not like math or science. Nobody should spend his life as a doctor. I believe that computers and robots perfectly suited for this field.

&amp;#x200B;

Briefly, I don't know what I want. I always wanted to become scientist but I am not sure I am on the right way. I am not sure to leave but I can't say I want to stay.

Only recently I found myself and started liking myself a lot but at the same time I have a lot of physical pains in random places in my body and lose hearing sometimes... no one believes me so no one takes me to doctor and I have been basically brainwashed into not liking to as for anything or ask for help though recently I have been getting better at it.

28,"For a couple of days I felt (probably still do) like I just want to end it all. I just wanted to vent somewhere safe and Reddit is a place I feel ok with.
Firstly had my high school ending/college starting exams and despite doing the limited amount for my Romanian language exam, and pretty good in psychology, I did poorly in maths and failed. Because of that I have to retake it. Not such a problem although it's stressful for me to know how bad everyone feels for me.
Secondly my best friend suffered from being rejected by a girl he like. She kinda gave him too many signs there could be something and after like 3 days he fell in love. Bad part, she was interested in another friend of ours, and although the other friend knew well enough my best friend was liking that girl, they still kissed. And I kept hidden the kissing behind his back part to my friend (to not cut himself or something) and he was angry at me. I was angry because he checked my private message on my PC to find out. (Another trouble, my best friend is kind of an asshole. He's already in a relationship, a long distance one at that, but he wanted to be with that girl, even though he still plans to move with his actual gf. He doesn't get me and some other when we tell him he's the one that got what he deserved.)
Now the second part of the second part, I stay good friends with the girl that dumped him. She's actually smart, and a really nice person. Like, she writes daily to a suicidal friend of hers that lives 100 miles away (enormous for this country) and wants a nice future and to become a doctor. But she's such a troubled person. Feeling like she might fall down anytime from mental exhaustion. I do too. Just this night she messaged me about this.
Thirdly there's a lot of minor stuff running around, like my fear of being a worker now that I finished high school, my absence from counselling sessions, my new found love for weed, my smoking addiction, etc.
Fourth me and my dad fight a lot. He's constantly pissed I do nothing right, I'm pissed he's fucking my nerves up. He yells, I punch. He gets angrier telling me he's gonna kill himself letting me all alone, him being my last parent alive. I breakdown.
Lastly and nobody will get why this bothers me so fucking much, but I don't and never had a girlfriend. It frustrates me to no end being all alone and seeing everyone score someone and me being all alone. I know, I am fat, like more than 220 lbs (100 kgs), but I know my looks ain't bad and people consider me an intelligent person that they can talk to and have fun with. My best friend even asked more than 100 girls for me and to no result. It just puts for me in perspective how worthless I may be and makes me want to die. I just feel like I start to think posts like ""girls only want a bad boy not a nice guy"" (not that type of nice guy, I provide emotional and intellectual support to a lot of friends and people in need without wanting something back) were true. I fear someday I'll either kill myself or I'll turn the back to my mentality and adopt a Incel-like thinking, which, I'd despise myself even more for. I'd ew at myself if I'll ever get there.

I just keep toying with the thought of how good it would feel to not have to feel anything anymore, or maybe cutting myself to relief, or even taking heroin so my dying process goes even faster.

32,"So I’ve been thinking a lot lately and I don’t really have anyone to speak to this about so Im deciding to drop it all here. I think I should also provide a trigger warning- I’m going to talk about a very dark place in my life so some self harm and other things will be mentioned. 
——————————————————————————


When I was in 8th grade, I was in a very dark place mentally. I had online friends I met on the app Amino who had very similar interests as I did at the time. They were very toxic and even pushed me to begin cutting myself because most of them were suicidal themselves. I remember I would cry myself to sleep almost every single night because I was so sad that I wasn’t as pretty as other girls and that I was chubby. I honestly think that groups negative views made me begin thinking like this. I know I would starve myself and self mutilate a lot. This included hitting myself, burning and even going as far as cutting myself until I passed out from blood loss. I would also pass out from not eating and almost got put in the hospital once because of my constant fatigue and malaise. My parents never found out and I have not told them to this day. Only very select friends and one of my cousins know about this because I am so ashamed of being so weak. 

I stopped all this when I cut off my toxic friends and when I became scared that I would end up dying. Kinda funny that I was suicidal and doing things that could kill me when I was so deathly scared of passing on. I remember that I wore sweatshirts a lot to cover up my scars and that I would only ever wear jeans. I know I relapsed a couple times but I eventually completely stopped and I’m proud for not going back even after it was so tempting. 

Anyways after that I met my first boyfriend. I thought he was better than sliced bread but we eventually broke up and I went back into my depressive stage because I was honestly crazy. I was so jealous and pushy that I couldn’t stand being single and someone not wanting me. But not too long after I started dating someone else but he cheated on me and made me always feel like I wasn’t enough because of this. I felt like pure garbage after he dumped me after I stayed with him and tried to fix things. 

Now, I am back with my first boyfriend. I have grown a lot and I’m honestly proud of myself. I think I have turned into a hugely different person and I can’t believe that the little girl who wore sweatshirts and baggy clothes has now turned into a girl who is proud to be who she is and isn’t scared of some scars. Now that I am older and wiser, I try to help any other person in my life who reminds me of myself. I have been told by many that I give great advice and I’m proud that I can help people out of their ruts since I know how it feels to be alone. I’m pushing myself to be a psychiatrist or psychologist later in life so I can help even more people who used to be just like me. I also plan on getting a tattoo of a gladiolus flower since it represents strength. :) 

So if you’ve made it to the end of this, thanks for reading. I just really needed to spill about this. And if you’re in a deep dark place- just remember that in life you will only be as happy as you allow yourself to be and that there is always help out there for you and a reason to live even if you don’t think you can find one. Life is worth living. Always.",10Jul2019,13

40,"I don’t even know anymore. It’s not even *that* bad, you know, and yet I came to some sort of realisation in the shower today that, “hey, your life kind of sucks.” 

I’m a 23 extroverted anxious female. I’ve somewhat travelled, I’ve lived overseas, I’ve seen some shit and have survived. But, I seem to lack a sense of direction, and want to simply *live*; not follow the generic ‘this is how your life is meant to play out’, but really try and grasp a sense of who I am, what I’m capable of, what do I want to do etc. by doing things I *want* to do - I like to game, I like to draw, read. I like animals, and the environment. I like to write, and I really find a sense of passion in caring for others. I’ll listen, I’ll understand, I’ll be patient. 

What does that all mean though? What can I do with all of those qualities? I’m not money driven but I can’t possibly survive without money, right? But yet, I don’t know where to place my feet, to go into the direction of where I want to be - ever since I was about 15, my answer to that question (where do you want to be?) was... “I want to be happy.”

I don’t know what to do, where to go, and the factor that deters me from living spontaneously, is my anxiety. I’ve been seeking therapy recently, which is great, but they don’t give you answers, right? They simply help *you* in trying to figure out the answers. It’s all you in the end. 

I’ve got the daddy issues; the abandonment, the abuse, the disappointing-daughter type shit. I grew up in somewhat of a developing country, and now live in a developed country. I have always followed the course of high school, and the rules and the books, and the guidelines. I’ve dated men all my life, and have never really been on my own - until March this year, when my relationship of 2 years ended due to them leaving (absolutely broke me). I left my job of 6 years, to figure my shit out. I’ve been offered jobs here and there based on what I’m studying at the moment, but I’m not sure it’s what I want to be doing? I recently applied for a volunteer program in... something I’m also not sure I want to be doing? I basically spend my days, finding a purpose.

48,"A year ago while I was on my way to Salt Lake City, I got a text from my neighbor saying, ""I think I found your cat. Well half of it at least."" I called my roommates and about 10 minutes later my best friend had to tell me that my girl, Harley, had been caught by a coyote. It was unimaginable. My family had kept cats my whole life, all of them had free access in and out of the house during that time and lived long lives, I never thought something like that would happen. We live in the middle of a *suburb-* but that's neither here nor there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I loved Harley very much. I have a blind dog and it was *crazy* how attuned she was to my dog's needs. We would go on walks together and Harley would walk in the gutter and head butt Liz before she would fall off. When the lights were out downstairs she would walk down the stairs two at a time so Liz would know how to step. She would go out at night but always be home sleeping by my head when I woke up because she knew if she wasn't *right* there Liz would get all the morning love. And she was always waiting on the doorstep when I got home. Such a good cat. Such a sweet girl. I was absolutely devastated and cried for hours on end everyday during my vacation.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I got a kitten shortly after and named her Vivi but realized too late I wasn't ready for a kitten so I re-homed her with a coworker of mine. She loves this cat very much and named her Lily. I'm really thankful that situation worked out for the better and that I was able to learn a lesson from it. I knew I was going to want a cat down the road but that I was liable to make another impulse decision. So, as controversial as it is and as much and I never imagined doing this, I got on the wait list for a specific breed of cat last August. A Maine Coon to be specific.

&amp;#x200B;

I started feeling sincerely ready for a cat around April. My roommates and I had agreed they could get a kitten before Harley died so they still got one about 2 months after everything happened. They already had a cat Asami who I hadn't been close with and then they got their kitten Ashe. After Harley passed Asami started to really comfort me and both gaining her affection and seeing Ashe grow into a full cat really mended my wounds.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been on the edge of my seat for MONTHS knowing I was #5 on the list, I'd started at #22. And *finally* **today**, while I was at work, I got an email with pictures of the current kittens I could pick from. There were three for me to choose from but I knew which I wanted soon as I saw him.  My heart just lept and my stomach got all fluttery, as stupid as that sounds. Honestly, I cried a little bit. So many people congratulated me because they've seen me through this whole year, saw my hurt, my mistakes, listened to me cry, then actually saw me starting to be okay and talk about Harley again and get excited about having a new creature in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get to pick him up July 31st so the journey isn't over but, I just SO fucking stoked.

Yeah I understand what he was explaining but how can I possibly remember everything when he only explained it once. Then he demonstrated it once. And he made me drive. Sure as hell I was slightly confused and very scared. He was fierce and had a strong aura. I kept making mistakes and he kept raising his voice at me, which I hate. I know I’m here to learn and not violate traffic rules and accidentally kill someone or myself but please, there’s a reason why I’m not reacting to ANY of your shouting. It’s because i’m getting increasingly stressed as the lesson progressed. 

Got shouted at so many times, he had to step on his instructor break thing so many times and I had no confidence and I didn’t even know what I was doing. There was just so many things to remember, I couldn’t digest in time and he made me drive out of the course and to the road. There, I also got shouted at and he had to use his breaks plenty of times also and I almost cried. Maybe it’s the pms, maybe i’m just mentally weak, maybe it was because I was very tired. But I was tearing up. And now, I’m on the bus and crying as I type this hahaha. I’m going to buy something to calm myself down and cheer myself up. I’m hoping I don’t get him as my next instructor and that I won’t be crazy anxious for my next lesson......",10Jul2019,2
54,"On one hand, I feel bad. I was raised in a very family oriented way. We've always done everything together. If anyone needed anything, everyone's door was always open. Family is everything to us, to me. I worry that they're going to trash talk me to anyone who will listen, and that includes my mom. My mom has stuck with me and defended me to them, and I don't want them to make her feel like shit. She doesn't need that extra stress. I also feel bad, because I'm not going to let them see my daughter. I don't want her around toxic people, but that means she won't know her family very well.

My family had always been there for me, except now. They think I'm going through a phase, they don't take me seriously, and they don't understand that everything they say is really fucking me up. 2 years ago, I started therapy and was diagnosed with severe OCD and depression, along with social anxiety. Earlier this year, I almost killed myself. They know I deal with shit and it really feels like they don't care. I know they have their own problems, and everyone deals with shit. But, they've always said they'll be there for me and support me through whatever, but that was a lie. I can see that now. ""We support you, but only if you're *normal.*""

On the other hand, I feel like a weight has been lifted. Ever since I came out, I've dealt with nothing but shit from them. Lies, hate, disrespect, arguments, all of it. I used to just sit there and take it and they were used to that. They were used to being able to talk shit and walk all over me and not expect any kind of reaction, because I always kept my mouth shut. I never wanted to anger anyone, I never wanted to start an argument, I never wanted anyone to talk shit about me. So I took it all and shoved it down. And I suffered for so many fucking years just to avoid making anyone feel bad. Because that's what I do. I put *everyone* before myself.

They don't believe that I have depression. They think I'm just using it as an excuse. They think that it's a phase and I'm being immature and stupid. All of these things have been said to either my mom or my sister, that's how I know. They want me to go back to being who I was, but they don't understand or care to understand that who I was wasn't happy. I've been so torn and stressed about my family. One day when I was venting to my mom, she said ""do what you need to do to be happy."" And I told her I want to cut off my family and she said she understands. I just really don't want her to take the brunt of it. She doesn't deserve that.

But, I'm done. I can't handle all these things that life is throwing at me right now. I hate making things about myself, so I constantly put everyone else first. But I am so tired. I'm mentally exhausted from everything. You know that quote from Bilbo Baggins? When he said he feels like ""butter scraped over too much bread."" That's how I feel. I can't take this anymore. I make so many jokes about suicide that my boyfriend and best friend are seriously worried about me, and I think they're justified. I don't know how to deal with all of this. I'm so scared of what will happen in the next few months. I just really needed to get my thoughts out and I'm trying to sort through my feelings. So, thank you if you got this far, my thoughts are everywhere right now.",10Jul2019,5
55,"So in the past year, one of my relationships fell apart and I found out my first love is engaged (who I've only been broken up with for six months) when he tried to cheat on his fiancée with me. Met a new guy, everything goes great, he ends up traveling abroad for a couple of months. While he's gone I get a kidney infection that needs antibiotics and end up getting a yeast infection which i try to treat with Monistat which chemically burned my entire vagina which is the most painful thing I've ever dealt with in my life. So now I can't have sex for possibly six weeks comfortably. And I already was depressed now I'm depressed out of my mind.",10Jul2019,1
56,"On a random Reddit account I had, I decided to troll and say some really bad things. Nothing was violent threats(although I said I'll beat your ass) but I made a bunch of inappropriate and insulting jokes to users and used a lot of swears. I did probably 10 bad comments in around 4-5 hours and then stopped entirely. Somehow, Reddit users contacted my university and an admission rep emailed me personally that some people have complained about particular comments on a Reddit account that they believe I own. I did not put any information that revealed my address or city or anything personal, but I accidentally said the dorm I was staying at and some academic scores I had. I'm assuming they ran the system through a database, and I was the one that matched those descriptions. The admissions rep told me that I am not in any trouble, and he wants me to come in to meet him. I have a few questions. 

1. Does the admission rep writing me in email saying I'm not in trouble guarantee immunity if I do confess it was indeed me that made those comments in that account?
2. Do I even need to respond to this email? If so, what would be the proper response that would benefit me the most in avoiding consequences?
3. Can I be punished if I admit that I made those comments?
4. Can I be punished even if I say I had nothing to do with that account, but they don't believe me and say the circumstantial evidence directly points to me? I'm asking this because the email tied to this particular account is a throwaway email, so even if they managed to get access to it, it would lead them nowhere. Usually, circumstantial evidence doesn't hold up in court, but I don't know how colleges could impose the rules in this situation if they think it's me.
5. How easy is it for my university to get more info about the account if they press Reddit? Would it be easy for them to access my IP address and link it to my address to prove that I indeed did own that account?
6, If you were in my situation, what way would you react to get the best possible outcome? Forget about the stupid thing I did and what is morally right. I'm not willing to suffer expulsion or academic probation or any dumb offense if I can easily get myself out of this. My current idea is to agree to meeting, and when I'm at it, say I have no clue about this account and any of the comments made. I was also thinking about deleting Reddit before going to the meet up and saying I don't even have the app. 

Note: I did not delete any comments or posts from the account or the account itself. I thought that would play into admission of guilt since it would happen after the email had come. 

Thanks for your time

TLDR- My college got complaints of troll comments I made on a throwaway Reddit account, and the admin rep emailed me to meet up in person to talk about it. What am I supposed to do?",10Jul2019,1
57,"8 or so months ago I posted about my ex breaking up with me and dating my best friend/roommate. Since then he moved out to move in with her, I moved back in with my parents, and I got a new job that I vastly prefer even if it pays less than my last job.

Mentally I'm doing better than I was, I'm still struggling from time to time, but most of the anger and crying is gone. The problem I'm having now is that my friendship with my (former?) best friend has clearly suffered. I've known the guy for 12 years or so now, his kids call me uncle. We have the same friend group and this whole situation has cause huge problems. He fucked over my viewing of End Game by inviting my ex last minute, so I pulled out.

Our friends attempted a Come to Jesus thing while we were hanging out and drinking and I thought it worked. He just won't talk to me though, unless it's important. He keeps flaking on hanging out with everyone. And I can't help but think of the worse case scenario and because last time it was true I can't honestly discount it. Did he hate me the whole time?  

I thought I knew him but this whole thing seems so out of character for him, normally I would just say I'm being paranoid but like I said, I was right last time. He did love my girlfriend at the time and he did swoop in when we broke up. Our other friends say that it'll get better eventually, when the relationship stops being new. I hope they're right but if he's capable of this then how can I trust him. Sometimes he apologetic and sometimes he acts like it's surprising I'm still upset. Like how dare I be angry that he dated my ex after explicitly telling me he wouldn't betray me like that.

I don't know anymore. He was always my best friend, he's my brother. Or he was. I can't tell if I'm giving him too much benefit of the doubt or if I should be harder on him.

67,"Lately I’ve been feeling disconnected from everyone and thing. Talking to my boyfriend or close friends isn’t helping, and playing video games all night hasn’t been helping either.
For some reason tonight I’ve been thinking of all the things that mentally traumatized me in the past, things I thought I was desensitized to.

I’m half Japanese-American, born and raised in a small country town with nothing but white rednecks and hicks all around. It’s really rare to see any race out here other than white and we get our fair share of racism. 
My first memory of racism I had was back in kindergarten going into first grade on the Fourth of July, I had gotten separated from my mother in our local town and I was looking around for her when I run into a group of male young adults, one hollers out to me mockingly  “Aw is the little girl lost?” Another then talks to his friends and says “wait I know her... She’s in the same class as my little brother, she’s Japanese.” Instantly the loud guy snaps and starts walking up to me slowly “oh so it’s a jap? Well you remember what they did to Pearl Harbor don’t you?”  He makes a bomb sound along with the whole hand show, his friends laugh and he comes close to my face and says the sentence I’ll never ever forget in my life: 

“Japs don’t belong here” 

I ran away crying and found my mom and stuck close to her I never said a word to anyone about what happened that day.
Fast forward to middle school when bullying was hitting its peak, a young boy was picking on me trying to get me to argue back or fight him. I’m really good at bottling up my feelings so I never let him get to me except for this day. He decided to throw out the race card during his squabble and says “so why did you guys blow Pearl Harbor up?” I’m taken back a bit but regain my composure he noticed my reaction and pushes it further but then it happened again: 

“Japs don’t belong here”

 I tried my best not to let it show but I was incredibly hurt. I remember going home that night literally tugging on my hair frustrated for being born Japanese, I angrily talked to myself in the mirror saying “if I don’t belong here I sure as hell don’t belong in Japan either! I’m alone!” I despised being Japanese and I even started to discriminate against my own race because of how badly I hated being Japanese, I blamed my mother for having me and teaching me this language and I started harming myself with razors. I remember telling myself that I’m the bad guy, I shouldn’t have been born, because I’m Japanese I should hurt myself because I don’t deserve to live. 

All throughout high school I hated myself but in senior year I met a boy who made me hate myself a lot less and he and his family taught me that self love is important. I was with him for two years but because of my depression and anxiety we couldn’t stay together. 

After I graduated I became a lot better mentally and I embraced my culture again. I don’t hate it at all. I don’t hate my mother for having me. I understand that what’s in the past is in the past. And I haven’t cut myself in about 8 months now.  I talked to my mother about this and at first she didn’t believe me because she assumed that I was too quiet to be involved in something like that, but she knew. My own mother apologized to me, but for what? For having me? That’s not right. Sometimes even though I know all this and this is kind of a positive end... The past sill haunts me and I have nightmares of it still. That boy approached me sometime after high school and apologized for making those kinds of jokes to me and I know that he didn’t mean to hurt me too badly, he was trying to fit in, but it still hurt.  I still dream of those foggy faces in the dark the night of the Fourth of July when I was just 6/7 years old telling me that “Japs don’t belong here” and even though I’m turning 22 now I still wake up in cold sweat shaking and terrified even though I know that it’s not true. 

To those group of young adults that bullied me on the Fourth of July, I still have night terrors of what you did to me that day. Even though it’s been years and I’m desensitized to asian comments and remarks, even when I’m able to joke about Asians and whatnot. I hear those words and I always get set back.",10Jul2019,1
69,"Growing up, for most of my life, my parents were basically roommates. They didn’t fight all the time or anything but they definitely weren’t a “couple” that you would picture cuddling up and holding hands. Obviously I’ve noticed it but I didn’t really realize how “not normal” it was. My parents also rarely spoke to me about romantic relationships other than my dad ranting about how I “can’t date until I’m 16” but no one listens to those rules. Now I’m almost 17 and only had one boyfriend at 14 which only lasted a few months. I’ve realized that my parents might be a sole reason why the thought of dating gives me anxiety. I have crushes but when guys make advances towards me, for some reason I feel dread. Maybe it’s just because usually it’s boys I don’t really care for lol. I want to have a boyfriend but I guess intimacy wasn’t really normalized in my household so I don’t know have to deal with it.  I think my parents just think I have “high standards” but in reality, it’s a whole other story.",10Jul2019,2
71,"Been in two bad longterm relationships, am 27. First one was pretty long from 18 to 25, which at first was good, then it totally sunk into codependency, then I stupidly forgave her cheating on me, then we kept it going for 3 more lackluster years. Never learned to speak my mind and was too passive. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second one lasted a good year and started out as a very solid friendship, but then we had sex spontaneously and that one was even worse. She wanted an open relationship which I was curious about for 2 months, then I hated it, but thought I had to truly experience it first. She was just an all-around egoistic person who was okay with me for the ride, but showed no effort on her part and also betrayed one maaaajor rule of the open relationship. We ended it pretty soon after. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago I started dating this awesome woman. She is all the things I wanted and all the stuff I didnt know I wanted. But, there's the catch, it's mature and calm. Theres no drama, lots of honesty and affection. It feels so good, might end up keeping this REALLY longterm (which scares me tbh).

74,"I’m a university student and for the past two semesters I’ve had this one really amazing TA in my political theory class, she was smart, pretty, and clearly put a lot of effort into her tutorials despite being a masters student and working another job in the side. I’ve had crushes before, but with her I just can’t pinpoint what makes me like her so much. It started with a general fondness in the first few months, like “hey I really like this TA”, then I started noticing how attractive, smart, funny and friendly she is, especially towards me. I started visiting her office hours and we’d get into great big passionate discussions about not just course content but really deep discussions about only partially related matters. It might have just been my imagination, but I really thought I felt a connection growing between me and her, like she’d always look at me during class almost by default, and she seemed to like striking up little conversations with me on the side, which I also really enjoyed.

Bottom line is, she’s a great person, like no one else I’ve ever met, and I’ve been totally bummed out since school let out in April because I haven’t been able to talk to her since. I haven’t been able to find her on any sort of social media, and I’ve made accounts on all the major platforms and dating sites praying she’ll  be on there and I’ll be able to confess my feelings. On top of this, I don’t know of any other way to contact her besides her university email. As much as I would have liked to, I never was confident enough to ask her to meet with me outside of school hours just because I enjoyed her company so much, and I kick myself every day for that. I’m not sure if this is even a crush I’m describing, or if I’ve gone crazy and become obsessed with this one otherwise insignificant woman, or if I’m exaggerating every aspect of her because I’m heels over head over heals in love with her; but the fact of the matter is I’m suffering without her. Every day I wake up depressed that I won’t get to see her this week, it feels like I’ve lost a loved one, and not just someone loved unconditionally like a parent but someone I’ve chosen to love. Sometimes I even cry about it. It’s that bad. I’ve had crushes before but this feels like something else entirely. It’s tearing me apart.

And to make matters worse, aside from basic information about her that came up during class or our conversations, I don’t know much about her, not what her interests are (besides politics) or hobbies or even if she’s single. I just know I like her A LOT and she seems a lot like me.

Now the solution many would suggest would just be to find her on my campus next year, but there’s an issue with that: I’ll be at a different university altogether on exchange and there’s a very good chance she’ll have graduated by the time I get back, meaning I’ll probably never ever see her again, and that fact hurts me way more than it should. I want to talk to her and learn all about her, see her laugh and smile and have more deep conversations like we used to, over coffee preferably, but I know that’s all just fantasy.

Now that you’ve read my story I need to know, am I just some obsessive creep who needs a reality check? And if not, what the hell are my options here? I thought I’d stop crushing on her after the semester ended but it just keeps going on and on, like some sick game. Any advice is welcome.",10Jul2019,2
75,"Hi im a maintenance guy at an apartment complex, was doing plumbing before but after some legal and personal issues and being union, i had to resign from my apprenticeship after 3 years and cannot work non union or else ill get blackballed and also lose my retirement i collected in so far.  
So after being close to homeless I decided to take maintenance job instead of my other skill of welding because they will usually include living space as a perk.   Not the best job, fustrating as shit because you need to have all around knowledge of every trade while also picking up dog shit  and since my property is only 64 units Im by myself so i take calls 24/7 365.  Awesome excuse for leaving without being rude, but not awesome when youre tripping on 3 hits while kramming out and you get a call abouta flood that turns out to be a small leak in the garbage disposal.
Well anyways, im fucking pissed... Im only 32 and had to go to ER because my knees were acting up, turns out i have arthritis in both my knees with I guess fluid between my joints, whatever that means,  and Im gonna need to see an orthopedic doctor to get an MRI and possibly surgery, and because some people abused painkillers I cant get any scripts for them because I guess a week or two supply for my actual pain is gonna get me hooked.  
I knew eventually my knees were gonna go from being a plumber, but at 32?  Wtf this sucks i been a skilled trades guy for most my life, I cant go back to telemarketing, as much as I loved getting yelled at by people for disturbing their evening of whatever people with landlines do. 
And right now Im in a gap in my insurance my insurance from before i lost on the first and my new insurance wont start til around the 20th.

I recently quit smoking weed and for those who may not know when you quit weed you get these crazy ass super vivid dreams with tons and tons of detail and basically feel real.  

Anyways the dream started with us walking past a bowling alley and her saying something along the lines of ""I really wanna go bowling but I never get to and no one ever wants to go.""  So I think to myself ""holy shit she's giving me a hint that she wants to go bowling"" so I asked her if she wanted to and she did so we went in.  We didn't actually do any bowling just sat at a table and talked for hours. 

Eventually we went to her place and talked some more while laying in her bed and I'm pretty sure things were about to get serious but then her IRL husband walked in in the dream then it ended.

79," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

80,I feel like I’ve lost everything. I can’t roll over and seem okay like everything that exists means so much more than it truly is. Everyday I remember her touch and when asked for it can’t be given. The days I’ve felt whole no longer exist. I feel empty in the sense of happiness. I used to feel good when I could curl into her arms and be told “it’ll be ok I’m here for you”. Now she’s gone in the sense of what it is that made me feel good. There is no light that can be brought into my life again without her switch. My love grows cold and I have become numb and act in malice. The simplicities of human pleasure can’t find me. The thought of love and emotion mean nothing without her. My every attempt to grasp the faint feeling of love within her heart is met with malice. A limbo of love.... holding on just enough to torture myself a little more each day knowing I’m dead to her inside.,10Jul2019,1

I'd never really got on with her in recent times as I used to just keep my head down rather than saying hello to her and I always felt she hated me because im ugly and quiet (the  type no advisor wants to bother with) I got a new job and I told my new job that id been in a temporary work placements the last 6 months rathery than being with that advisor the last 6 months as I said (because they didn't want to see too many gaps in unemployment, I lied) and my advisor (who didn't know tbh) contacted my new job to confirm my employment, and then my new manager questioned me about where I actually was the last 6 months ( I nearly got sacked) I emailed my advisor angry about it and her responses were her mad to on the defensive she replied with things like ‘I will not contact you again now if this is what you prefer’ and ‘I’m sorry you are unhappy about this but I do wish you well for the future’ etc. but but I quickly apologised as I realised she didn't know I lied I replied ‘ok sorry to make a fuss’ and she didn’t reply. Then the next day I emailed  her again and asked her could I get a bus pass for the first week of work as I worked a week in hand and apologised again also about my misunderstanding and she replied ‘that’s fine graham, don’t worry, if you want to come in to office ‪before 5pm today‬ I can sort this out for you’. Later that day I  went in to my advisor and I sat there about 10 mins (I thought she’d of wanted rid of me quick tbh?) she asked me about getting to work and how much it usually costs etc. I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was writing the paper form out for the bus pass, so I apologised again she then said 'it's alrigggghht' (but sounded annoyed) I then explained my manager questioned me about it and she seemed surprised and said 'did he?' And then she said 'just we have to contact them to confirm your employment' Then I said 'Its ok I understand' and she went quiet as she written the paper form out for me then just asked when I’m next in (my new job) I said tonight and she said ‘tonight?’ (Idk if she was passing conversation or asking about travel expenses).  A moment later she passed me the form and I stood up to go and said thanks, then she leaned forward slightly sitting down with her hand out and said 'awwwwwwwwwww, awwwww (more like rrrrrrrr) (it was prolonged than what I typed like an gap filler tongue tied I think) and said a few things then I said ok and slowly walked away (out of nervousness) she then said 'let me know if you need anything else' I just said ok and slowly walked away and then she said ' oh..and I'll stay in contact to see how your getting on, I'll contact you by email if that makes things easier for you' and smiled (I mainly Contacted her by email) (she said it all upbeat and bubbly) I said 'oh ok thanks, great' (I'm really shy)she said 'awww ok' then she turned back around sitting on her chair and said 'oh and...(I turned back around again) well done' and smiled and then turned back to her computer. she said well done a lot since I got that job",10Jul2019,0

84,"I feel so depressed. If I didn’t have my boyfriend, I would be dead right now. He’s the only one who still cares about me and supports me. I feel guilty for feeling like this because I have a family and a boyfriend, I have enough money and my health’s good but I still feel like this and it’s mostly because of BDD.

Currently I’m worrying about my job. Haven’t been there since Thursday and I’ve missed out 3 work days. Told them I was sick and well made a mistake with that. Tomorrow I have job and I guess I’ll go and ask them if I can get an unpaid vacation for a week or so. Would like to quit my job but I guess later I’ll regret that decision. 

I feel soooo lonely right now. Yes I have a boyfriend and he’s staying at my place for a couple of days but I still feel lonely. I don’t have any friends. Really. I thought I have made two but as soon as I dont text someone they won’t too because they don’t need me and that makes me feel so miserable.

85,"Learning to love myself, when feeling like everything is coming at you is only there to break you down has been one of the hardest things to do. I had interests and explorations that I was never really able to dive deep into because of the fear of being ridiculed, and now I feel so much more free. I've associated myself with people that support and love me, instead of those that expect me to dedicate my time to them at the expense of my own happiness. Living with the pressure of not being perfect to someone killed all of my desires to do or be anything other than my own ""entity"" I guess. I don't have time to be an option to someone, or to fix the emotions they refuse to control. Sometimes, having enough can be painful, but it can also be a beautiful revelation. Those that broke me down no longer have the power in my life to do so, those that made me feel delusional and sad over emotions that I have the absolute right to feel aren't allowed to hurt me anymore. What you give to others is what you receive in due time, and the only thing I ever want to give is my love and positivity, and I can't believe I let a dark cloud over my head control the narrative for so long.",10Jul2019,1

87,"Two months ago I graduated from High school. 

I never thought I would, I had failed almost all of my classes the first three years, in total I had 9 out of the 27.5 credits I needed to graduate and get I somehow still caught up in the last year. I busted my ass from January of this year until my graduation, constantly working on whatever it was I could and it paid off. 

My parents haven’t been the best. They divorced when I was five but still tried to maker things work between them for me. My dad is Bipoar and has Schizophrenia. My mom is very immature and will try and manipulate you by guilt or even blackmailing you. But they loved me. 

My dad showed his love by trying to raise me to be the the best person I could and not end up like him, which was by screaming at me and hitting me to try and keep me in line. My mother buys shit for me. She would throw a fit and tell me how I don’t love her etc. and show up the next day with  food, toys, scratch off tickets or whatever else it was that she thought would make me happy at the time. 

Obviously all of this had a toll on me, I ended up becoming very insecure about myself and having no confidence. I would work on trying to better myself but It always seemed like my parents would hold me back. Whether it was my dad degrading me or my mom making me feel like shit I could never be happy with my own life, they had to be happy with it too. 

As I said, I graduated. I earned a shit ton of credits too and was really proud of myself, and thought it would make my dad happy so he would actually be proud of me. Instead he blows up on me because I got an F on one of my exams. (Still passed, had straight A’s and it just brought my final grade down to a B-.) He ended up saying something along the lines of “Why the fuck did you even graduate? You’re worthless and you should’ve just dropped out a long time ago. Fuck you, Im done with you, I’ve tried too hard and nothing seems to work so I’m just giving up, do whatever the fuck you want you little bastard.” 

Hearing that from the one person I wanted to be proud of me really fucked with me, it was like all the progress I had made in the past year was for nothing, so I packed a suitcase and left. I didn’t talk to any of my family for a month. I fortunately have an amazing best friend and was able to stay with him, and since then I’ve been the happiest I’ve ever been. 

Ive gotten a job that I make pretty amazing tips at, on top of $10/hour, and also that I enjoy. Ive lost 40 pounds and don’t hate myself when I look in the mirror anymore. (~205 down to 162) I got accepted into college and found out that I’m getting quite a bit of financial aid along with a $5,000 pell grant. I think I’m actually figuring out how to live my own life, and it’s amazing. 

But my parents hate it. I started talking to them about a week ago, and all they’ve done since is complain. About how they think I should quit my job because it’s shitty or about how I should live with my dad during college instead of moving into an apartment with friends. I told them I don’t want to live with either of them because they’re both toxic and make me feel like shit and they put all the blame on me. 

My dads doing very bad, he’s on oxygen full time now and may have cancer. My mom hasn’t changed a bit and still tries to make me feel like shit so I’ll help her. I just feel like they’re using me to make themselves feel better by trying to control my life and worry about my problems rather than trying to figure out their own shit. 

I don’t feel like there’s any possible way to salvage our relationships and I kind of don’t want to either. I feel like I’m a dick for being so happy with my life when my parents are falling apart, but they’ve done it to themselves and I can’t let their problems prevent me from being happy.

88,"I'm new here, so not sure if I'm posting in the right place...did the Google search to not find anything related to my topic; not at all unusual these days. Seems Google wants us to spend all day searching, or just give up...

Anyway, I'm a gentleman in his mid-fifties who had a stroke 10-ish years ago. Long story short, my wife/her friends, family were toxic. Narcissistic, Sociopath and quite proud. So got the big D, and a big relief. Been to five years counseling, to find my true self again.

Moved in with my parents with my kid, to get away from it all. And now the latest problem (but certainly not new...)

My parents (in their high 70s) are control freaks. I've never been good enough...my daughter gets more praise and help. Basically, I can't hold a job b/c of my stroke. To the casual onlooker, I seem fine, unless I'm tired. But my memory sucks, as does my reaction time, and I sometimes have issues finding the words I want to say. Embarrassing? Yes, but I try not to let it bother me. But I've tried four jobs, and generally the younger, impatient bosses just aggravate and complain until I leave. I've been through a lot in life, and stood firm despite all odds, thus the resulting stroke. Now, I won't deal with BS. I give a chance, if no, I just walk out.

My parents are the problem now. They are perfectionists, my dad wants me to finish restoring an old car of his that he signed over to me, but will not even come out to my shop to advise me what to do, even though he knows all about it. But he wants it done...I can't go on like this.

I am reading a book about doing work online (enterpreneurship, basically) and I want to move to another state to get a fresh start. I can do this, it's dealing with strangers in person that triggers my ""brain farts"". But I have very little money, not enough to get new housing. They basically want me to stay and take care of them when they get to where they can't take care of themselves. They don't admit to this, but it is implied. They are ones who rule by the ""Silent Treatment"". They don't talk to you, you figure out their wishes and everything is hunkey-dorey...In my opinion and my therapists, this is abusive. But I need to escape. I need to know how to apply for government aid, which I know absolutely nothing about.

If anyone can give me good advise, it would be well appreciated. I can't stand it much longer, and I don't want to live out in the street like Skid Row...thanks in advance.",10Jul2019,3
89,"I am 25, still single but for different reasons, i kinda lost trust in marriage more and more.

91,"I copy paste here. I posted this but I want more opinion. 

Firstly, I am not a native english speaker and I am not good at english. I hope you can understand my problem and help me.

In  my country (in europe) medical school takes 6 or 7 years after high  school. And too hard to get into most of medical schools. You need to be  good at math and science. Also it is most competitive degree to get  into. I am student at one of best medical schools of my country. I was  good at math and science (like physics, chemistry, biology etc.) in high  school. I always wanted to become scientist. And I thought studying  medicine is best way to become scientist. Because there are many  scientists with MD degree. There are many physicians with nobel medicine  prize. And their discoveries save lifes. Being doctor is prestigious.  Also the mean salary of doctors is not bad. So I thought med school is  good for me but I was wrong. It is  a complete disappointment. It is  just memorization a lot of information. I hate anatomy, biology etc.  Studying for exams gives me depression. I find medicine easy to  understand but too much information to learn and recall. I realize that  I'm not interested in biology. I lost all respect for biology/medicine  and being doctor. And I started to think that computers can replace  human doctors easily. I surprise that how they didn't replace so far.

I  realize that I'm more interested in math/physics and engineering. I  want to leave medicine for it but some parts of me want to believe I am  wrong. I don't want to lose 2 years for nothing, I know I am young but I  feel too late. Also I am afraid of being wrong again. I don't want to  take risk. I don't know what I want anymore. I don't know what I should   do. I don't want to continue my medical edication but also I don't want  to leave. I lost my father and we are not a rich family it is also hard  for my family.

When I say I hate  medicine, people are surprising. Because most of people think being a  doctor is hard but worth it.  I don't think that. Not anymore. A stupid  job full of memorization of useless things. Not like math or science.  Nobody should spend his life as a doctor. I believe that computers and  robots perfectly suited for this field.

Briefly,  I don't know what I want. I always wanted to become scientist but I am  not sure I am on the right way. I am not sure to leave but I can't say I  want to stay.

I'm sorry for my english. I tried to do my best. I hope you can understand me.  I wonder your opinion. Thank you all.",10Jul2019,6

101,"The only two relationships I have been in ended in both of them cheating. The first was not as bad since the relationship was short and we were young. Still hurt the ever living hell out of me and I found out I had no control over my emotions and had suicidal thoughts therapy. I found I am very very co-dependent. 

I did not have a lot of connections growing up, making those connections I did have really important to me. Which would sometimes lead to me letting people treat me pretty badly just so I had someone. I am happy they decided to be upfront with me and break it off before I found out she cheated, but to later find out that it happened really hurt.

Second relationship was a lot better. I felt I had grown while in therapy, that I was making progress in my life and taking control for once. We dated for a handful of years and it was great, I felt like I found someone who understood me and what was happening to me. They had their own handful of issues though. Due to my co-dependency I made it my life’s goal to help them in the same way I had been helped. I did everything in my life to be their rock, someone they could trust in confide in. Little did I know, despite the changed out look on my life, I was still being very co-dependent. If they were sad, I was sad. They mad? Me mad. I “helped” them by taking their emotions and tried to handle it myself. As ass backwards as that was, I thought I had grown enough as a person that I am up to the task. By this point I had stopped therapy so I had no frame of reference to realize that I was making mistakes.

I am not entirely sure why they cheated. I know that I was not the perfect SO and early in the relationship I was still learning to handle things better. I ended up handling everything for them. It still kicks me that it ended the way it did. I am happy I was able to end it before they could cheat, but seeing what they were saying to other people absolutely destroyed me. 

Most recent one wasn’t long ago so I am still recovering from it all. I hear the things they say about me on their social media and it hurts. I try to distance myself from them and everything, but our friend circles are close, so I always end up hearing something. Though I made my mistakes, their actions in the relationship were still bad. They mistreated me and those around me, taking what I had given for granted. 

Despite all the things I did wrong and wish I could have changed, nothing is stopping me from changing for the better. I am going back to therapy and joined a group with people who were in similar situations as I was. The thing I have taken away the most is as much as I wanna be the problem solver, I don’t have to be. I sometimes am the one who needs help.

This summer I thought was going to be fun, didn't know it was going to be filled with regret. First thing's first, I committed adultry with a hooker. Cousin was like you have to have fun in your life, and tbh I was horny. I didn't want to do it but I thought why not. Committed it and immediately fely regret. I realllllyy feel a lot of pressure from god and guilt. This was 2 days ago and I can't get it out of my head. I never imagined I was going to do this until marriage. I love a girl, and thought I was going to get married to her. But this cousin basically ruined me and I really hate that.

The next thing is I drank alcohol. Might not seem like a bad thing, but for me it's really bad. I always looked down upon these actions and never thought in my life I would do them, but I did.

just fyi, i have clinical depression and have to see a therapist twice or at least once a week. boss man knows this. however her office is now working on summer hours so it's 9-1 monday thru friday's.

She said that when we I took her home, and after that she quickly told me goodbye and entered her house, and me, an absolute dumbass didn't even ask ""to where?"" or something, I didn't even told her goodbye.

112,"So a bit of context: She had to hide the relationship from her parents and sister. It was hard getting around that. But we made it work pretty well. She said herself that she was okay with this and that she wasn't going to let her religion get in the way. She's Muslim, I am not.

This was the first relationship that I put my all in to, before this I had no idea what I was doing since I was just a kid in his teens figuring things out. This time, I had experience, was more mature, and knew more of what to do and just how to be myself around her. I feel as if I did right by her and treated her the best that I could. Obviously I made mistakes here and there, but they were never more than small arguments that stopped as soon as they started because we both worked through it. 

We broke up recently over something I should've seen coming. She told me that we weren't going to be able to continue the relationship. I asked if I had done anything wrong, telling her to just be honest since it'll help us both grow if we know what went wrong. She told me that it had nothing to do with me and continued to praise me for being the best boyfriend I could've possibly been. It was because of the fact that I'm not of her ethnicity and that I'm not practicing her religion either. Now, I saw the religion thing coming from a mile away, and truthfully I was ready to convert. I loved her and was willing to be a part if her life in more ways than one. But the thing that caught me off guard was that I wasn't her ethnicity either. 

We talked about that first a while and it all came down to her parents. They are extremely strict and influence a lot of her decisions. They had talked about her marrying &amp; said that it was okay for her to marry whomever she liked under the condition that they are her ethnicity and practiced her religion. She had previously said that she was against arranged marriages but now shes suddenly okay with being someone that her parents have to approve of. I didnt understand it, and I still dont. But I respect her decision even if it hurt me. I felt like I was being minimized only to my race. That the way I was treating her and all the love I gave her amounted to nothing because of something I couldn't even control. 

At the end of it, I wished her good luck in finding someone who fit that criteria. I said ""I hope you find someone who loves and cares about you as much as I do"". We hugged and parted ways. My conscience is clear and I feel like I can move on from this without too many tears. It sucks to have someone that I love dearly leave my life because of this. It truly does. But I feel like shes making the mistake, not me. I know that sounds conceited, but it's just how I feel about this. I'll miss her, but I know in the end, I did nothing wrong and gave her an amazing relationship. I hope to continue with us being friends.",10Jul2019,0

But I’m scared of the prospective of eventually moving out on my own. Or even working to begin with. I don’t even have a car myself right now, or even a license to drive. The only person who has a car is my parents and my step dad works during the day and usually takes the truck with him, unless mom requests it the day prior, so I wouldn’t be very reliable for getting to work outside of my scheduled hours. Then there’s the fact that all the jobs around here only offer wages that are minimum wage(7.25 in NC) to 9.50$ and that’s not liveable at all in the areas surrounding those jobs, rent on average around here is 625 at minimum.

What makes you turn away from talking to someone? Or makes you say, hm this isn't someone I want to stay in contact with. 


Maybe it's something I'm unknowingly doing or not understanding .
It's becoming frustrating as it seems a pattern that I can't make meaningful relationships with others. I'm tired of being alone, but I'm honestly very weary of friendships. I think maybe this is what might turn people away. But, I'm not one to turn a shoulder. I'll laugh, share a joke, and smile. I just can't seem to make a friend other than an aqquaintance. People tell me I'm too nice, but I don't think that's what they really mean. 

I had a coworker mention how happy they were to have a new coworker who was fun and not stuck up like me. I was taken back. It really hurt, but I'm always nice, kind and friendly so I don't feel like I'm one to blame. I've never hurt her, so I think that's her deal not mine, so I let it go. I wonder if I should have spoke back or not. That was incredibly rude.

I've noticed that I rarely leave myself alone with my thoughts. When I'm not doing those other things, I tend to drown it out with music. 

I play music everywhere using either my headphones or speakers. On the bus, when cooking, to tidy my room, at work 🤫, to brush my teeth, in the shower. You name it.

When I see someone on the bus for example who doesn't have headphones in and are not looking at their phone I wonder, aren't they bored or what are they thinking about?

119,"Throwaway because this is one of my biggest secrets and I'm still genuinely confused. I also don't know which subreddit to put this in exactly but r/self seems pretty broad enough to get at least a few answers.

I don't really know how to start this. I can't even say it out loud to my own self so typing it down seems like the best option. I guess I should just dive in? It might be a little long. 

I'm 4 years younger than my brother and when I was around 6 or 7 or 8 (can't remember exactly, but that range seems correct), he took advantage of me sexually. He would have been only 10-12 at that time. I don't remember how long it went on for or how many times exactly it happened, but I do remember some snippets. I remember him telling me about sex and what it was. I remember kneeling in front of him as he sat on the toilet and he was making me go down on him. I never did it because I was scared, weirded out, and confused.  There was also a time when he'd make me hold his penis when we used to sleep in the same bed and I remember being fascinated with how it felt. But I didn't know any better. There were even times when he'd ask me questions like ""What if a naked guy was lying down and you suddenly fell onto his dick, what would you do?"" 

But the biggest thing that I remember is this: I don't remember how I got into this situation, but I remember him trying to penetrate me anally when we were in the bathroom. It couldn't go in, obviously, but I'll never forget the feeling of it against my skin. After that, I just remember my mom shouting at me after she caught us. She said something about sex but since I was so young, I had no clue what she was talking about. After that, I have no memory of him ever trying anything again.

I didn't think of it much when I younger and I even forgot about it for a while. But when I was in 7th grade, the memories came back and for a while, I felt disgusting. I felt so detached from my brother. Angry, even, but I couldn't even fully understand why. It was around this time that I distanced myself from any physical male contact. Every time my brother or even my dad would go close to me, I'd feel so disgusted and move away. 

Now I'm 20 but I'm still as confused as ever. I grew out of my wanting to distance myself from male contact but I still detest being physically close to my brother. I don't know how much of an impact it had on me but I'm honestly terrified of how it might affect any relationship I have in the future. I've made out with guys before, but that's the farthest I've gone and nothing has ever happened below the belt. I don't necessarily shy away from sexual contact, but I'm worried that when I finally get fully intimate with a guy, what happened to me in the past might affect me... especially when it comes to having a penis come in contact with my skin down there. But I guess I'll never know until it happens, right?

My relationship with my brother isn't strained because of it. We're like any other pair of siblings, but I would really rather not come into close physical contact with him. I also NEVER brought it up with him and I never will because I don't think he remembers. 

So what prompted me to finally open up about this? Last year during a family reunion, I was watching my 10 year old nephew. He was so innocent and so curious and my mind flashed back to what my brother did to me. My brother was around the same age when things happened. He could not have had malicious intent. He was probably just curious as well. At least, that's what I was telling myself.

And so my biggest question is this: if he didn't know any better, does it still really count as sexual abuse in every sense of the phrase? Was I sexually harassed? It sounds like such a stupid question, and reading what I already wrote already screams the answer back at me, but I've been confused for a while and I feel like I need to hear someone else say it so I can finally move along with my life.

But lastly... How do I properly deal with this? I haven't told anyone. If my mom remembers, I'd rather not bring it up. But this hasn't been eating away at me or affecting my day-to-day life, it's just like a tiny nag in the back of my head. I just want to know how to fully come to terms with it.",10Jul2019,3
120," 

I've tried to fit in since I was a  teenager, not to be the cool kid in the bloc or whatever, just a  good friend you could have a laugh with. It never sticked. Friends  lasted only as long as we had to sit in the same classroom, it never  carried beyond. I'm not an interesting person, a secondary character in  someone's book maybe, and not even the main of mine.

I know now what I am. It isn't anything to write home about.

I was pretty certain, actually, I still am, that what I got wasn't the important part, it's what I did that was. I think we're only as good as what we give others and that helping each other is the way to go. That's why I worked at jobs that gave a feeling of usefulness, be it in hospitals, for the blind people, or anything where I made someone's life easier. I did 2 years humanitarian work in Africa just because it was the right fucking thing to do. I still believe so. I just don't know what I got out of it. The difference one makes as an individual is laughable, as terrifying as it is, we don't account to much, even in our own life. 

I traveled to change my mind. I can't complain, I've seen a few places, both known and some hidden gems. It doesn't stick. I see things the same way I see a picture on the computer: I'm just not there, I'm lacking myself. 

I thought that if I wasn't much, at least my dreams would mean something. I had two: helping people and writing. The first died in the previous paragraph. The second one I did in the hopes that they would be read, and maybe, just maybe, help someone or make them dream, or anything, really. It died when I actually made people read my stories, be they contacts or on forums or actual editors. I have no talent for it and the skill I gathered in years is simply lacking. 

I'd wish giving up on dreams would be aleviated by something else in my life, but the rest is lacking too, such as romance. For a decade I wondered what I could do, better myself,  let it flow, fix what could be fixed, every bloody time it would fly  right back into my face and I'd wonder why I even bothered in the first  place. I finally understood the  lesson, I'm unremarkable. There's  nothing about me that can make people dream or hope for an interesting  life, It's just blank, and I don't have anything to offer, my  conversation is unasked for as is my companionship.

It  took time, but it was time I threw the towel. By now, I have no clue on   how to handle a circle of friends or how any aspect of a relationship,  be it friendly or romantic, actually works. At the end of the day, I   like people, and I wish them for the best, and that best isn't with me.  If someone wants a shot at hapiness, might as well do it with somebody   that has a clue on how these things work. That is not me.

I'm  now in a boring job, with no social contact, and that's it. I avoid   people, I know I bother them and I don't like bothering people. I have a  boring job, but then, my passion lost me. There's nothing that  interests me out there, be it professional or not. And I've been in   heavy psychological therapy for over a decade, I recently dropped  it. It wasn't bad, mind you, but I don't know if it ever helped.

I   feel old, I'm 30, and yet I only ever felt old, empty inside. I have  no clue how it is to feel ""young"", to let go of things and just have  fun. I don't know when was the last time I had fun.

My   days are spent reading, reading a lot, all the time. Escaping in a  world that doesn't exist is the only thing I'm good at, and I don't have  to see people actually living when I do that. I don't harbor any grudge  toward people or society. Everyone has his own problem, and what for?  It wouldn't bring anything, and there is no injustice to speak of here.  It just is what it is.

I  wish I had  the courage to end myself, but even for that, I'm a coward, I don't even  manage to pretend to do a mockery of a suicide.

So   I wait, I just try to live a quiet and invisible life, not bothering  anyone and hoping to die from some sickness, the only thing I'm waiting from   life is to end me. I'm so sick of life, there's hasn't been a point for  me for more than half my life, and I'm bored, so bored.

I   hope there's no afterlife really, to die only to end up mulling about  the blankness and emptiness that has been my life would be an annoyance.  I'd prefer the void, seems more reposing to me, and fitting also, A  life of nothing and a death of nothing.

121,"early 20s, F, UK based.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want some kind of advice. Life at the mo seems so hard. I feel so incredibly self-absorbed to be complaining like this but it's the reality of how I feel/think at the moment. It's like every area of my life has gone to shit, and I see others around me thriving and being on track to achieve what they want (both personal and professional) and it's so painful that I'm not the same way (peace and fulfilment -it's all I want).

&amp;#x200B;

1. Degree - I always achieved so well at school (state school). Overcame coming from a low income background to get Straight As and A\*s across the board at school. This led to me being admitted into a top 3 law school in the UK at a World class university in London. I have struggled throughout the degree, and became increasingly demotivated. I think a large reason for this was feeling overwhelmed by sudden upwards mobility. It is likely that, despite my excellent academic record up until now, I will leave only with a 2.2 classification. I also failed the year abroad (studied in France). All this has been a huge blow to my confidence and self-esteem. I'm so upset that I didn't thrive at university, having worked so hard to get there. On top of this, I found myself often low and isolated due to the intensive reading required for a law degree. Due to failing motivation, I  was never on top of the work, it was just horrendous and scarring. I see my friends who went to a lesser ranked uni, doing an easier degree who have absolutely thrived and are now doing masters degrees. Meanwhile, my enthusiasm for academic study has been destroyed. I hated my degree. At a  loss.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Family - over the past two years, all my grandparents passed away in quick succession. This was a huge blow to me, and I'm still heartbroken. My mother got into an argument with my Aunts over the will, so that side of my family has blown apart.  Concurrently, my younger brother has developed a serious illness, and was in hospital for a year, and has recently been readmitted. He has problems with his brain stem but it remains undiagnosed and untreated. We are just in a constant cycle of him being admitted to hospital then released. This is utterly heartbreaking to me. For this reason, I feel like I can't complain about my problems to my parents - they are already struggling just with my younger brother.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Friends - I always had loads of really healthy friendships, but I've pulled away from a lot of friends over the past year. I think mostly due to how much I'm going through. Some however were healthy pull aways - in that the shit time I was having did give me some perspective and made it apparent to me that some dynamics had been unhealthy for a while (e.g. competitive). I just have little energy for friends at the moment. I'd like any advice on getting back out there with friends, it always gave me much joy prior to this period.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Relationships - I was really in love with someone, but I was never with them and they didn't choose me. Although they said they had really wanted it to work but were scared to act on it. I've been in a shit place regarding this and the lack of closure was painful. Since disconnected myself a bit from the situation for my own mental health. I would like to find a good relationship but don't know where to start in the midst of all the other cr\*p that is going on right now.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Direction going forward -  what I would really like to do in life is be an entrepeneur and have my own company. Nothing else interests me as much as that. When I mention this ambition, so many people seem so quick to tell me of how much work it will involve, why I should do a more conventional job etc. Just generally doing the idea down and projecting. Any advice on how to stay strong and go your own route instead of the so-called conventional way.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: reddit help me sort myself out. This all seem indulgent, but my feelings are just as valid as anyone else's. At a low-ebb right now, and would love some healthy advice on all of the above. It's been the hardest time of my life, and it's so hard to see everyone around me thriving while I am struggling this much. Not because I don't want them to thrive, but because I am in a bad way. Early 20s have sucked.

122,"Hi, i’ve never used reddit before but here goes my sob story. I’m hoping I don’t sound like a little bitch but I just need to get out of this hole i’m in.

I am so fucking stuck in my life right now. I am 21 years old, male, I don’t have a job, I live back with my family which isn’t fun, I have a suspended drivers license (from minor traffic violations that I couldn’t pay because I was laid off at my job before I could pay them off) so 90% of the places I apply to will not hire me due to not having reliable transportation. I would ride with a family member but they all are too busy working full time and friends are out of the question because I only have 2 that are usually too busy to reply to my texts let alone drive me to or from work. I have depression and anxiety, I live in a weird ass small town in Washington state on the coast where there are crackheads and homeless people everywhere you look and barely anywhere to find work, it’s always raining or overcast and we get sun maybe 2 weeks in the summer which probably doesn’t help anything. I just want to get a job, get my license cleared and renewed so I can drive my car to and from work, and move the fuck out of my parents house so I can stop thinking about the wrong ways to be unstuck. I am not asking anybody to feel bad for me, just advice or for someone to listen. I have a laptop and a smartphone so maybe someone knows a way to make some money online so I can pay for my tickets and get my license renewed or something? I’m just really not sure what to do, I just wanted to rant. Thanks for reading.

PS: I know I sound incredibly ungrateful to be living under my parents roof without a job, and many people have it 1000x worse than I do in the world, I am grateful for what I have and will forever be grateful for it but I know I can do better and can’t think of anything to get out of this hole.",10Jul2019,2

129,"I kind of lucid dream everyday. But the thing is i never decide location, I let my brain decide story and location itself and from on there I decide what to do with the situation. I never really thought of this as a gift, but all my friends have constantly been telling me that they’re unable to make choices in their dreams, or even choose their actions as they’re dreaming. For me this was obvious, of course you could do that, aren’t that what dreams are about?
But I soon realised why I’ve never really experienced that kind of nightmares that people usually explain them as: Being trapped, unable to move or do anything and the horror just surrounding them and them being not being able to do anything.
For me nightmares were different, I was living the nightmare, and every choice I made had a huge impact on the continuing story. If I made the wrong decision the evil and horror in the dream would catch up and I tried my best to escape. I would often find myself dreaming the same dream twice, and then while i’m dreaming i remember “I’ve done this before, I’ve dreamt this before. I know what to do here and what not to do”. It was of course a relief but my mind would never rest during dreams.  I’d wake up anxious and disappointed in myself, how did I fail once again?
But my ability to lucid dream did help at times. When I felt too overwhelmed in a dream, I could simply just walk out of the scene, almost like walking out of a door, and then appear in a new scene: A new story.

I had two neighbours, John &amp; Steve, John worked in some factory and sold and did drugs on the side and Steve was special needs since birth, in his flat was just a chair and a tv with a ps2 and that was pretty much it you sat on the floor.

Alan had been in the army and was late twenties roughly the same age as me give or take. He'd come back at some point and had fallen out with his mother and had been homeless for so many months untill he'd seen Steve walking down the street and they had bin to school to gether so Steve let him in.

I knew his mother coincidently, I had worked with her at a high class retailer for clothes and food, she had another son who was also in the army but he was killed in action. 

So after meeting Alan the first thing I did was roll him a joint and pass it to him and just said you can have this.

If I am to have a normal life, I can't live in resistance to what is happening. I have made peace with my truth. I'm no longer talking about the problem, no, I am not sweeping it under the rug, I'm turning life to the sunny side. We don't have to be super realistic and dreary all the time. If reality is bad, find a place from which it seems sunny. It can't be all dark. It might be difficult, but it's not ALL difficult, dreary or shitty. It's sunny also. I know nobody will probably answer this post, I just made it to make myself remember this day and this change that I am introducing to my life. For good. I would talk about my problem, give a little background, but that goes against the life philosophy I am trying to establish or re-establish or whatever. Thank you very much for reading.",10Jul2019,6
138,"I’m feeling really good after a therapy session and I wanted to share my happiness. 


It’s been a rough couple of months for me and I’m making steps now to improve my situation. 


Long story short : My mom got a double mastectomy, rehomed my dog because it was too much dealing with my mom and a puppy, work started to suck badly. 

My anxiety took the reins from there and life became a struggle, having intense panic attacks before work daily because I didn’t want to be there. 


So I quit my job! And taking some meds with therapy too. Actively trying to improve myself and change things for the better. 


And I feel good! I have a part time job right now and have more time to take care of my mom and focus on getting my mental health better. I’m hoping that this positive upswing continues. 


So yeah I just wanted to tell someone that wasn’t my therapist. And to let people know that you can definitely change your life for the better, even in small ways. Because reading some of the uplifting things on here definitely gave me hope that my life can improve. 


So if you decided to read all of this, thank you! And I wish all of you internet people well :)",10Jul2019,6
139,"Hi, I'm after a new gas cooker as my old one isn't great. As the old one has a conventional oven, it takes very long to make absolutely anything. This is why I need a fan assisted one.
Unfortunately, the old one is 50cm wide with cupboards around it so I am restricted to just that size. All that I've found online at that size are 'conventional'. So I'm hoping that someone here can perhaps help.

P.S. I live in the UK.

Thanks in advance guys",10Jul2019,1

I’ll have to get my shit together soon and pretend to be happy that I was denied yet another job for bullshit reasons. 

I fucking want to die.",10Jul2019,1

145,"I want to take a group into a stargazing spot but before I do so I want to check out if it's any good by myself so as to not make a bunch of people drive for an hour just to find a huge pile of dissappointment. I don't want to bother anyone to come with me on that first trip, though, and I'd enjoy it better by myself but at the same time it's such a scary idea to find myself far from anyone with no help if anything were to happen. 

It sucks because as a child I lived in the middle of nowhere and I never felt fear, I even went to check out a hill 20 minutes from home, crossing the nothingness in between and enjoying the peace and the trip, no second guessing, no worries. But now that I'm older I have to think twice about it, worry about attackers, pay attention, wonder if it'd be safe to stay in the car and check the stars from within its safety and abandon the idea of stepping out and trying night time photography.
I don't have any self defense tools, and I'm not sure I'd react appropriately anywho.

Just about anyone else would go with the safe option and ask a friend to tag along, but it irks me so much having to give up my lonesomeness in exchange for some peace of mind. I used to stargaze as a child from the garden of my home and enjoy the quietness. I'd love to  live that feeling again, listen to my surroundings as my mind gets lost in the beauty of the night sky, no worries about what some other person wants to do or say, if they're bored, if they want to talk.

What do?",10Jul2019,1
146,"I had the opportunity to play the team sport my boyfriend plays as a hobby today, and it was amazing! I avoided sports at secondary school because I wasn't cool enough to join the teams even though I loved playing netball and football as a kid.

I felt like I was part of something again and had the nicest team mates who kept giving me tips on how to improve. All the crap thats usually in my head was silenced for an hour and i got that post workout high afterwards. I haven't felt this good in years. I think getting involved in a sport will be really good for my mental health and I've surprised myself with how much I loved it!",10Jul2019,1
147,"This happened back in August 2018.

I was visiting the Fujian province, which is in the southeast of China. I went to this small tea... place. I wouldn't really call it a shop, as it didn't really focus on selling tea, but was rather a place relax and enjoy it. Anyway, I stopped by to try some. I'd also like to mention that I had some stomach cramps, and I desperately needed a place to relieve myself. I went inside, and asked where the bathroom was. When I went inside, my heart dropped.

It was a squat toilet.

If you're not familiar with these abominations, they look like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=squatting+toilet+china&amp;client=ms-android-tmus-us-revc&amp;source=android-browser&amp;prmd=isvn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVpbmatqvjAhXC1FkKHRiuD7QQ_AUoAXoECAwQAQ#imgrc=ozcBUKIEq_iqmM). You basically have to squat on the ground to use them. I'd also like to point out that I didn't have any prior experience to using these, except for the time I used it to pee (which was pretty straightforward, I'm a male). Now, maybe I'm stupid, but I have no idea how to use these things. If I just pull my pants down and do my business, it'll drop into my pants. I solved this by TAKING OFF my pants, going naked from the waist down. I did the deed, and felt much better. I put my pants back on, and flushed.

Except, it didn't. I looked in horror as it just swirled around, not going down the hole. I couldn't just leave the bathroom in this state. Maybe these things weren't meant for takings dumps in? Or maybe I'm just like the poop knife guy. Speaking of which, a poop knife would've been pretty handy in that situation.

I couldn't just stay in the bathroom forever, so I thought up of plan B: finding something to... chop it up with. To be quite honest with you guys, I was desperate enough to use my hands. Fortunately, it didn't come to that. I slowly ventured outside the bathroom, log still stubbornly floating in the squat toilet. I looked at the ground, and behold, a toothpick! I picked it up and quickly scurried back into the bathroom. I cut up the mess that was inside, and it finally flushed. I breathed a sigh of relief. I wasn't going to be humiliated today.

TL;DR: I clog a squat toilet and had to improvise a poop knife.",10Jul2019,1
148,"She tells me she's always worried about things but she never tells me what she's exactly worried about. I always assume it's my fault, but is there anything I can say that she can open up with me to tell me exactly what's wrong? I'm really good at giving advice, and I know I can help her but she's not telling me her problems.

What can I say to her to open up to me?",10Jul2019,2
