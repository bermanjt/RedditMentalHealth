0,"On March 15th, 2018, I was studying abroad in Ireland. I was only there for two weeks when on that Thursday I was woken up by a phone call from my mother at roughly 7:30 in the morning. At first I thought it was my alarm since on that morning I was supposed to get up early for a trip my classmates and I were going on. I picked up my phone to turn it off only to see 'MOM' in big, bold letters on the screen. I thought she was calling me to make sure I was awake for the trip but that didn't happen. I don't think i could have been prepared for what she was about to tell me through her gasps for air. I remember just screaming no and thrashing my legs on the bed till the covers completely surrounded me. One of my roommates yelled behind my bedroom door if i was alright, but i didn't answer. 

I remember gasping for air as I stood up from my bed to look out the window, seeing the morning sun shine on the rolling hills of Waterford. I don't know why I needed to look out the window. I think i just needed to see something else besides my dark room. My mom was telling me that everything was going to be fine, God bless her heart, but at the time i could only think of how i was talking to him the night prior. Everything didn't feel like it was going to be alright. And sometimes it still doesn't.

It's been a little over a year since that incident, and maybe every other day I can't help but want to show my father all I've done in my last year of college. But i can't. The other days I'm okay. I feel at ease knowing that the last thing i told him was 'good night, i love you', and i couldn't be happier for that fact.

I miss you dad. Not a day goes by where I don't think of you. I love you.",26Mar2019,3
1,"Honestly I just don't know. I'm underweight, but toned. Don't really care about living longer, and I'm not doing it to get a date since no one in the gym is interested in some short, scrawny, bald guy. Why am I bothering?

To kill time I guess like every other part or my life it all feels pointless, just something 4k occupy the hours until I can go to sleep again. 

It all feels utterly pointless when you have no friends and no one who cares about you or thinks you're attractive or anything. ",26Mar2019,2
2,"I'm always there for people. Even if I'm busy, I'll find a way to make time for someone I care about, no questions and no complaints. The minute I ask someone days in advance for help with something, everything and everyone goes silent. I hate this.. ",26Mar2019,4
3,"I really need to get this off of my chest. 

My husbands best friend and him worked for many years together. The guy was at our home every single morning and evening for YEARS. He went camping with us, to concerts, every event or fun thing we did. He was there. 

The only problem though was his drinking. He had a bad alcohol problem but was a functioning alcoholic at that. As the years went on his drinking problem got worse. To the point he couldn’t work anymore. We tried to help him and get him help but unfortunately he didn’t want it. And every time we saw him, he looked worse and worse. 

One hot September day last year, my husband calls me and says that this friend is in the ICU. His mom found him on the ground having seizures. 

It didn’t look good at the hospital. His heart was functioning at 10%, his kidneys had shut down so he was on continuous dialysis, his liver was on it lasts leg. All bad. As the days went on, he wasn’t getting any better. So what they did was slowly take him off sedation so the doctor could talk to him. After a few days, he woke up, completely coherent. I’ll never forget the phone call from his mom to my husband. She said my husbands name and then said we needed to get to the hospital immediately. When we arrive there are MANY people there.  All of his closest family and friends. He chose to be taken off of life support and not get any morphine. So with his consent and everyone in the room we watched as they stopped the dialysis, took him off of the ventilator and stopped the morphine drip. The doctors told us it would probably only be a few hours before he passed so everyone stayed in the room with him. HOURS go by and he was sitting up talking to all of us just like normal him. We stayed the whole night by his bed side. He fought going to sleep because he said he wasn’t ready to go yet so all of us close friends stayed and laughed it up with him. By morning we had been awake for almost 2 days so my husband and I decided to go home and sleep. When we woke up we got news from his parents that he passed, peacefully in his sleep that morning. 

I’m really happy we got to spend as much time with him at the end. He was a great person, with a large personality, great sense of humor and a contagious laugh. It was really hard to see him completely yellow though and as sick as he was. I know he didn’t want to die at the hospital but at least he wasn’t alone. 

Thanks for listening. I have a medical background so I new what to expect but it was really hard and my husband and I are still struggling with it. Just needed to type it all out. ",26Mar2019,24
4,"After all these years of lead up, I had my hopes up for this report. Despite all the warnings I had heard that there was a strong chance that we might get exactly what we got.  And I know that there is all these people saying how suspicious Barr's summary is.  

But I can't help but believe that even if we were to get the full report, that we won't get any more info that would move towards impeachment and or indictments for Trump.  

Worst of all, I feel like this will/has just completely emboldened the alt-right  / TD / etc.  That those that might have been on the fence would be more likely to lean towards voting for Trump again.  I already had a pretty bleak outlook on the future of this country and the world.  But 4 more years of Trump would pretty much make things impossible to come back from.  

Sure didn't help that yesterday I also found out I did not get the freelance job I was really hoping to get.  ",26Mar2019,0
5,"This is going to sound silly, and I'm sorry for the incoming rant/vent/whatever you want to call it but I thought I would type this up. Seeing posts about the Nintendo Switch and hearing news about all the games releasing for it and all of the good games people are playing greatly saddens me. This probably sounds like the dumbest crap, stupidest crap but right now in my life I'm going through the early stages of adulthood. When I was a kid I lived a pretty crappy life. I lived with my mentally ill Mother who prevented me from going to school because she was scared they would ""turn me gay"". She prevented me from having friends or living an actual social life because apparently everyone was a child molestor who was out to get me and turn me gay or report her for not having me in school.

In that miserable, lonely, void, without friends. I did have videogames. I had the original N64 when I was young. At 5 years old I beat Zelda Ocarina of Time by myself, Majora's Mask, Super Mario 64, Diddy Kong racing and so many others and so many others. I had fun adventures in Pokemon Yellow and later Emerald, Diamond/Pearl, Black/White I had so many great adventures and even though no one was there for me, even though I dind't have friends I could escape with videogames. I could find a world of happiness. I worked so hard to teach myself since my Mother wouldn't properly homeschool me. I've taught myself everything that I know. And now I'm a young adult. A bright future awaits me but..it's sad because I feel like I'm missing out. I don't live in poverty, I don't starve, I don't dress in tattered rags but I barely scrape by on what I make. There is no money for extra fun stuff. It's hard seeing all these things coming out because I want to play these new games so bad having been al ong time fan. And for the first time in my life I can't. It'll be a long time before I can play Zelda: BOTW, Mario Oddysse, Mario Kart, Pokemon Sword/Shield, Smash Ultimate or any of the other fun games coming on Switch.

I feel so silly because out of everything, right now the thing I want most, like right now. Is a switch. I want to be able to open the box and peel the protective screen off of it. I want to be able to ahve that new electronic smell and just sit down, boot up Zelda and go on an adventure in Hyrule. I feel silly because like yeah I'mg rown now. I'm 22 and at the same time I find myself yearning to play these videogames. I've grown so much in the last couple of years as a person, as an adult. Yet I still can't stop wanting a Switch, stop wanting to have those adventures. 

I just needed to get this off my chest.",26Mar2019,4
6,"I don't know what exactly changed. Maybe it's the nice weather we've been having, or the fact that I'm actually being honest with my therapist, or that I'm being kinder to myself--but I've finally started to get back that spark that I lost since summer ended. I feel like myself. I feel so outgoing and happy and like I can see beauty in the world again. 

The other day I made a fire for the first time in a long time. Fire, to me, is important, and the creation of it is one of the most satisfying things in the world. I felt alive again, humming and singing to myself as I gathered sticks and leaves and tinder. Today, I went for a walk around my city and danced to latin music under a bridge. I climbed up huge stone steps and stared at the river for a while, watching the sun set. I laughed and smiled back at an older couple when they caught me shamelessly singing along to my music. 

I worked on my videos and was reminded today of why what I do is important. I ate good food and listened to a few sad songs. In moments I felt pangs of loss and sadness over the mistakes I'd made, the harsh words I may have said, and the things I know I could've done better. Of the people that I've lost over the years. But instead of beating myself up over it, I acknowledged my mistakes and said to myself ""I'll do better next time."" I felt anxiety about my future rise in my chest but I used methods my therapist taught me to handle it, and it actually worked. 

Life is all about experiences and learning. I'm young, and I've made mistakes. I'll continue to make mistakes, and I know it will be hard sometimes, and not everyone will end up liking me. But I feel... alive again. After so long of not being able to see the good in everything, that's the best thing I could ever ask for.

7,"I’ve got bruises 

Black and blue, formed in the shape of a handprint 

I’ve never met a man 

Who would squeeze my waist so tight 

So tight, so tight that I jolted out in pain 

But he held my arms over my head, so tight 

 So tight, that it left bruising all over my waist 

I’ll touch my sides and wince in pain 

I can’t get the memory out of my brain 
 
I’ve never met a man 

Who blamed his roughness on his stature

How degrading it was to spin me around in a circles

Nude and on display 

For his own pleasure 

How submissive I was, for not saying no 

“You’re hurting me. This is too rough.”

Instead I dissociated and lost all sense of time or feeling 

I consented, I willingly acted upon

There is nothing I could feel but uncomfortable. ",26Mar2019,3
8,"I love her. We’ve been dating for a year. When we got together she thought she as straight, but realized she was bisexual a few months in. She thought she was attracted to me and still thinks i look good, but she’s not sexually attracted to me. We’ve done sexual things fairly often and she thought something was wrong with her if she wasn’t into it. She always pretended to be so i never knew. She only realized she was fully homosexual yesterday when we talked about it and figured it out.

She said she loves me just not physically attracted to me. We have a very very strong emotional connection and are very happy when around each other.",26Mar2019,2
10,"I’ve noticed this habit of mine and I know that not everything I’m sharing with people is at all interesting. Most people seem to humor me for the most part. I just don’t know how to stop doing it. 

An example of this would be my bf saying something super sweet to me. I just want to share it with my friends but I know that it wouldn’t really be anything that important that I should be sharing. 

The same goes for when I do something embarrassing. I’m incredibly candid about it and I guess it’s just how I cope? When I feel stressed, I share it with people. When I’m happy, I share it with people. 

I’m the queen of oversharing and I just don’t know why or how I can stop. ",26Mar2019,1
11,"About five months ago my then boyfriend broke up with me. I was dealing with a deep depression and lots of emotional issues, when he basically realized I was being a burden in his life and decisions, so he preferred to be alone. Sometimes I feel guilty, sometimes I don’t even know how to feel. Before, we had talked a few times about moving in together, eventually get married. I really wanted to marry him. I remember telling my psychologist how I felt like I was staying out of breath just imagining my days without him. Really, I would never have thought it was going to end.

At least I don’t cry so often these days, and I have met a few nice people, which at the time was kind of difficult due to my social anxiety and lack of interest in socializing.  I have a job, finally, and I’ve been taking more seriously my work when drawing, which I did not do so often at the time. But sometimes I miss him... even when I’m still so heartbroken. It still hurts to feel that the person with whom you wanted to spend the rest of your life with, and the person you considered your best friend just thought you were representing a struggle in his life. 

Maybe it was better that way.

Even worse I can’t seem to find the motivation to even get a day job to have some spending money to do things I enjoy rather than scrolling through social media hoping for something to change. I broke up with my boyfriend because I felt under appreciated but now I’m more alone than ever and my mood can not seem to balance itself out.

This last Christmas my brother said he couldn’t come, and this is uncommon but was understandable as his financial situation wasn’t the best. My birthday is really close to Christmas, and of course my brother called and wished me a happy birthday. He seemed perfectly fine and the next day I had a basketball game. When the game was over my dad gave me the worst news I’ve ever received...my brother was dead. He was hiking and fell off a cliff.

16,"My life changed dramatically in less than 24 hours and now I’m so fucking broken I don’t know what to do. I have trouble handling grief, and last Friday was the anniversary of the day my friend was murdered in the Brussels bombing. Now, it was 3 years ago and it shouldn’t affect me so bad anymore but right around this time of year I just can’t help but lose my shit. I don’t even know why it affects me so bad... Maybe there’s something wrong with me. I’ve just been under so much pressure with school and work- supposed to graduate in may but I’m failing 2 classes, and work was just really stressful. 

I was bartending at a nice upscale restaurant uptown. I’d been working there for 2 months and the owners for some reason always had it out for me. Nothing I ever did was right. Well grief hit me and I got really sad and had to step away from the bar a couple times to pull myself together. I was making mistakes and I just wanted to go home and cry. Well they fired me. 

I’d recently reconnected with a long-time crush from 9 years ago - I was in a relationship when we met, but I always had a soft spot for him. He stayed at my house a couple nights over the last week and everything was perfect. I thought it was going to go somewhere. I could see myself with him. 

After I got fired, I proceeded to get shitfaced alone, he said he’d call me when he got home from work. Well he never called and I sat there alone in my thoughts and was just so upset over literally everything. I sent him a really mean text, because I was mad he never called, but I don’t remember what I wrote because I deleted the text. He won’t even talk to me anymore. 

My life went from having a stable job that paid the bills and finally a good guy in my life, to jobless, lonely, and stuck in my head in a matter of hours. I slit my wrists that night. I would have probably finished the job if my knife wasn’t so dull. I’m weak. I’m sick. I had so much optimism and felt so good for the first time in a long time. Now I can’t feel anything anymore. 

TLDR: lost my job because I was sad about my friend who was murdered and couldn’t focus, got drunk and slit my wrists, lost the only guy I’ve really liked in the past couple of years... all in less than 24 hours.

17,"Is a fucking stupid proverb. I'm the type of person that needs to be in a relationship to be happy. I was in a happy relationship once and it ruined me when it was over. I've always felt incomplete without a relationship. I just want someone to give my all to and share life with. I never hated myself, I just preferred to be with someone. I heard this proverb and I thought there was something wrong with me...people told me I needed to be ok with being single and be ok with myself before I can get a relationship. I wanted to improve myself and one day be in a relationship again, so I took this saying to heart; it ruined my life. I spent a lot of time alone trying to be ok with myself and being single but it just made me bitter. I saw people with friends and lovers and they seemed so happy, why couldn't I have that? I spent so much time alone. I was SO bored. I didn't talk to anyone anymore and my days became empty and devoid of social interactions. I grew to hate myself. I only spent time with myself and all these negative thoughts. I've always wondered how someone can hate themselves...I've always wondered why people go insane when condemned to solitary confinement. Now I know. 

Being in a relationship made me happy. I've always been incomplete. I NEED someone to give my all to. Similar to how a parent puts their child before their own self, I want to dedicate myself to someone because that makes me happy. I didn't hate myself, but now I do. Congrats. Stupid proverb.

I myself have been 100% true to our relationship and wouldn’t risk anything to lose it. I recently just found a video that COULD POSSIBLY BE HER. The video had an alright quality. But everything matches, her nose, teeth, legs, body, nipple color, sex moans, AND HER EYES. She has a scar near her eye and the video shows that same exact scar in the same exact spot. Along with her teeth, I know I sound crazy, but I did some really intense detective work and I just can’t get myself to say, “It’s not her.” Everything matches. I started thinking and she has usually been protective of her phone all the time. I didn’t want to be that kind of boyfriend who always asks to see her phone.

25,"Guys, I started this year off in a pretty miserable situation.

 The ""love of my life"" had just dumped me, then kept me in a manipulative holding pattern and called me the night before my birthday (and graduation) to tell me all about her new boyfriend and next possible love interest. 

I was 10 pounds underweight, hopeless and had maybe 2 friends I'd talk to over the phone out of state. 

Needless to say, the start of 2019 was a literal shitshow. 

Well, fast forward just 2 months later and things are pretty different. 

I just cut contact with the ex, started seeing a therapist and out of nowhere a close bond formed with some random kid I met off of bumble B.F.F.  

A new guy came into my life and we are each others best friend and self improvement buddies.

I cant really explain just how much the initial shock of everything had on me, but I can assure you that I had hit rock bottom from everything. 

It wasnt until I started making healthy, positive decisions for myself that things changed. 

If you change your standards, change what you tolerate and become responsible for your own self love and happiness, the world will absolutely work with you. 

Every now and then I'll miss my ex, and I'll think back to the time I spent being my own worst enemy. 

I hold no anger towards any of it at all, but I also hold no emotion in general for it. 

I think when you really start letting go of what hurts you and allow positivity in your life, things just change. 

Keep your head up guys, things get better.

27,"Hello people.  Sorry if my rambling sounds like mumbling. It's late at night.  I'm a junior in high school and if there's one thing I hate most, it's the way the schools are set up.  First of all, it really isn't a ""school"".  It's a daycare.  It's actually a daycare.  I get to school every day and it's got to be the most boring place ever.  The one thing I want is for the day to end.  Don't tell her, but when the teacher has a boring AF lesson, the one thing I do is keep calling the teacher's phone so I don't have to endure the pain of just trying to (or not) listen to the teacher.  I was a good student, but not this year because there was a revelation that came to me sometime last year about school being ""fake"" and all.

I hate when my parents keep nagging me to make better grades.  What I want to tell them, is ""Why do you want me to make better grades in something that does no good service to anyone?""

I just had a huge epiphany while typing this up:  The real reason why school exists beyond elementary/middle school is to make ""students"" understand that whatever they do illegal, they must cover up good enough for no one to find  and the pipeline from school to jail is for the students who are stupid enough to vape in the class while the teacher is lecturing in the same room so that there are more smart people out and about AND so that judges get paid more.  and at the same time in that way, it's all about obedience.

If you can't tell.  I have a cynical view of school because it really doesn't allow me to do what I'm good at.

School makes students crack down on the most arbitrary subjects.  Why did I have to take Gym, health, geography, biology, earth science (aka middle school science), government, French, precalc, etc, etc...

Even if I was interested in school, the pace in the class is so unbelievably slow and there's no option to speed it up.

So I'm doing the dual enrollment program for senior year and I took a bunch of clep exams so that I wouldn't have to take my first year or so and so that I can graduate with my associate's in web development, but I'm thinking far into the future, and where there used to be something, it now seems impossible to achieve.  I'd like to be a business owner, but I'm not going to do a business management degree because there are no job opportunities for it.  Ended up not doing accounting because I was very much turned off by the number of years it actually takes and I ended up with web development because it's a field I can learn, takes only a few semesters of college, and pays well.

Colleges seem to extend high school just another year longer when they tell freshmen that they have to take certain general education classes regardless of their major.  College it should be about making more-than-competent workers, not hinder student's career by a whole year of bull.

So I'm 16 and still waiting for my life to start.

And I just have another epiphany: My previous epiphany was mostly wrong.  The real reason why is that it's because of the parents who were brainwashed to believe that school still works and they're the ones paying for it, but I've had that epiphany before.

I've told my mom much of what I said, but she just doesn't get it.  She says ""school first"", but I say ""Cs make degrees!"".  We bpth used to say ""School first!"", but Ive changed.

I've always had a nocturnal enurisis problem and I have DDAVP, but that only masks the problem 93% of the time or so. I we the bed this one time and she bans me from my business I've been doing. I pressure wash driveways and refurbish mailboxes.  I had to cancel a job with a guy who wanted me to do his mailbox on a certain day.  **But entrepenurial efforts is exactly what the schools should be teaching!! I dislike how my mom doesn't respect about my business and my wants to be industrious as much as she wants me to be good at this imaginary school.**

33," Every so often I have a dream where I make up with a really close friend I had two years ago where one day, by chance, I meet her in public and for whatever reason we are both excited to see each other and slowly we would catch up and rebuild our friendship. I love/hate these dreams since it feels so good to have closure, or to repair a relationship that meant so much to me, but when I wake up I find myself disappointed to be awake and all of memories of losing the friendship floods in. I think of what I could have done to avoid losing her friendship, and a lot if it is so stupid and obvious but I was too ignorant to see that telling someone that, ""I sometimes wish I would just pick up a gun and shoot myself to end it all,"" **does not** help make a friendship last very long. The worst part is that I **knew** this would probably scare her, but I feel so alone for whatever reason I could not help but tell someone. Unfortunately this would lead to her cutting off all contact with me and her parents got the school to tell them to tell me to never talk to her again - a nightmare when you share a class and sometimes even end up sitting near each other as we both preferred the front row. Unfortunately the problem got worse, and this is when the dream would occur most often, where I would feel pain from being ostracized for months and would shut myself to the outside world when I could have made other friends. It felt like someone died, and I was confused since I usually don't care about friendships too much as I know everything is temporary, but I still felt like throwing up and wanting to die even more as school became torture, as I only had panic before something was due to find the motivation to get homework done. When my family moved to Georgia (because of their work) I didn't really feel too much, but recently I have been realizing not only have I lost all my friends in Florida due to my depression/being a state apart, I also haven't made anything more than acquaintances in school. The worst part is that I am trying to become friends with this one girl in school, and I feel like what happened the previous year is haunting me where I feel I have regressed socially, from when I could speak clearly and articulate my thoughts with precision to fumbling with my words when I speak to someone I want to become friends with. All of this and I still feel empty since I haven't been able to replace the friend from Florida, and I know that the rest of Junior year and Senior year next year won't be enough time to make this potential friend into anything more than an acquaintance. So now, to finish this rant/ramble, I am beginning to dream about my friend in Florida more often again and my feeling of despair and emptiness seems to continue as buying new objects fail to satisfy my happiness, as I feel that I am screwing up a new friendship before it even becomes one (though I know it is probably just my brain over analyzing), and as I try to motivate myself to study for tests in AP classes and for the ACT/SAT while feeling that I am probably going to end myself somewhere down the line (though it always ends up just starring at the wall and crying instead of actually having the guts to hurt myself). I guess saying all of this won't really change my situation, all I can realistically do is to **try** to make my potential friend, a friend and maybe during the Summer hangout or meet up or whatever. I just have to keep my depression away from our conversations, so I don't repeat the same mistake twice, and then try to ignore my brain telling me that I am annoying to her or that I am not good enough for her since while I sit depressed and cry in the weekend and do hw due to panic, she is being active and goes out on hike (what I hope to do one day). Honestly my biggest enemy is myself as it is mainly my brain that is telling me to feel depressed, or to over analyze, or to feel like I am never going to make friends in the time I have left in high school. Honestly I don't know if I am going to make her, or anyone else I am trying with, a friend successfully, but after crying so much last year, doing something is better than nothing. At least I know if I screw up I won't have as much emotional attachment compared to the friend I knew for years and lost in Florida. (Sorry for the overly long rant)",26Mar2019,2

43,"A beautiful friend of mine made a finsta post today acknowledging his obsession with fictional love expectations. I’m so happy he expressed this realization.A couple of months ago I realized this about him: he watched too many movies and read too many books. Not in the sense that he literally watched and read to much, but that he made what he saw in fiction a real expectation and definition of love. No no no. Love is not something fictional and although fiction is a great way to express true human experiences and emotions, it is often coated with falsehood. People express love in such different ways and commonly love through fiction is shown in  it’s most admirable fashion. It is shown in a way that is so enticing and ‘perfect’, yet hardly an attainable reality. I feel like growing up constantly reading and watching these love stories, we set expectations for love when in love there really should be no expectations. Love, I believe, is something greater than “an intense feeling of deep affection” as most will define it as. Love is one of the greatest mysteries of existence and surely can not be defined by a book or movie as impactful as they can be. Love is unique for each experience yet still there seems to be a universal understanding of the emotion. Love is like the people of the earth, very different in each person, yet one in the same. 

I’d like to share what he said. “I’ve spent a lot of time in life trying to figure out what love is. I’ve read books, I’ve watched movies and TV shows, I’ve asked my parents to explain it to me. I have looked all over the Internet to try to understand what love should be, but therein lies the problem. I have tried for so long to have loved shaped in the way I’ve seen it in movies and books. Love is an unique experience for everyone. It will never be the same for people. Love is what gives life meaning. Love for your friends. Love for your family. Love for your significant other. Love brings out the best in you. But love also lies. Love is not guaranteed to be with you forever. Love can leave if you let it. love will find you but it is up to you to keep a hold of it. No money, no car, no material body is worth more than the emotions you feel for someone. Promise yourself that you’ll wait for love and when you find it, promise you’ll try your hardest to hold on. No matter how hard it gets I suppose. But always, ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS follow your heart.” 

This is his current stance in what Love means by definition for him. His struggle with knowing what love is lies in the expectations created through fiction and what others describe it as. I feel it is common among humans to make this mistake and so important to realize what he has. Love is unique for everyone and to set expectations or guidelines can be detrimental in  the experience or potential experience of the emotion. ",26Mar2019,2
44,"I started playing in the 4th grade and stopped in 8th grade. At first of course I wasn’t that good but I eventually started getting better. The years went on and In the 8th grade our team was pretty good, we were winning by 5+ goals every game but then most of the best players left the team (they all joined the same team out of school) . When this happened I became best player in the team, and I really don’t want to sound cocky, at all. We always had less players than the other teams, there weren’t enough of us. We started to lose every game and I was tired of it. The lowest point was when we were playing a really good school, they had 2 players I knew were very good and i made a fool of my self before even starting the game. I saw them and I didn’t want to be humiliated so I didn’t wanted to play I wanted to go home, of course my parents didn’t let me, i was pissed and literally started crying, not like crying out loud but like I was so pissed that I started crying. Everyone was very supportive to me, they motivated me and I eventually had to play the game and we lost, not by that much but we still lost, it wasn’t that bad. I wasn’t the leader I was supposed to be as the best player and that makes me very upset.  A month after I left the team and didn’t play soccer ever since. I tried out for my high school soccer team last semester as a junior, and I didn’t make it. Not even to JV. I kinda expected it because I didn’t play for over two years but it still made me very sad.

49,"(To preface: I'm very introverted but I'm extremely sensitive. I want people to like me and I want people to understand me. I barely talk to my family, barely step outside, and I'm barely up from my bed or my computer chair. Yeah, I sit on my ass all day, but I'm shipping out for AF basic training soon. I graduated high school last year. I spent the past 9 months in the most densely populated place I've ever lived in and I never made a single friend. I never tried to make any, so it's nobody's fault but mine.)

It's the worst thing in the world, being ignored by the few people I make the effort to talk to.

I reached out to my ex from about seven years ago because I had a dream about literally messaging her on Facebook. Weird dream, she must be lurking in my subconscious. We didn't end on bad terms, we never really had big fights, and I had every reason to assume we were still old friends. Sure, it's been a few years since she and I have communicated, so I don't expect much when I messaged her.

I message her, ""Last night I literally had a dream that I messaged you.""
She replies after like half a day, ""wack""

I'm expecting more a reaction or even a ""how have you been?"" given the circumstances, but whatever? At least she responded, I thought to myself.

I say, ""So I had to say hi, so hi.""
She reads the message and that's literally the end of it.

I'm disappointed, to say the least. Pretty sure I didn't say anything wrong. I'm being honest. I really did have that dream and it was as weird as any regular dream. Was it wrong of me to contact her? Maybe! She does have a boyfriend, but it's not like she's solely a romantic interest to me. It's clear she doesn't want to talk, but I wish it wasn't a silly game. Why doesn't she want to talk? Don't just leave me on read. Considering we've known each other for seven years I think you should owe me that much. (but it just doesn't work that way does it?)

I'm the kind of person who will never talk to someone unless there's a high chance they'll talk to me... if that makes sense? I shouldn't have even bothered I guess. See, I don't reach out to people very often at all. I've had specifically ten contacts on my phone for all of my life and half of it is elderly family I never really bother to talk to. So, it crushes my heart that the one time in a blue moon I try to talk to someone she shut me down so quickly. 

I've wanted to say hi for a long time, maybe at least a year, but I never had a reason to do it. I finally found one that felt valid and here's what it got me. I guess she isn't really my friend any more. It's bitter to say it, but I suppose that's how things are now. 

Now I just feel dejected and foolish... like I'M the one who did something wrong. It took me awhile to work up the nerve to message her and seeing how that went, let's see how long it takes for me to reach out someone again. I'm better off talking to a chatbot because that will give me more of a conversation than she did.

In hindsight... am I overreacting? Maybe. I still feel pretty dejected though. Did that interaction matter? Probably not, but that's one less friend and those are in a real short supply for me. 

I'd love to hear someone's thoughts on what happened between her and I.

TL;DR - I, an introvert with a glass-fragile heart, reached out to my ""ended on good terms"" ex from seven years ago and the conversation ended when she left me on read after three messages in total.

I’m moderately intelligent, pretty, kind, I have a great set of friends, a nice job, a great flat, two cats that let me serve them at their pleasure... all of the things a woman of a certain age should want, should be content with. 

On the flip side, I’m woefully overweight, I have PCOS, thyroid issues, and I live with depression. My mom passed when I was 31, &amp; for reasons past my understanding my biological father hates me. I didn’t realize I had daddy issues until a few years ago when my dad wouldn’t speak to me at my niece’s bedside as she was dying. It was an eye opening experience. 

I shut myself off- I’ve not been on a real date or had a meaningful relationship since Bush II was POTUS. Sometimes, the self hate is super high... but what I realized today, and every day since my birthday is that I don’t want to live this way. I have so much love to give, my body has, despite its girth, so much strength and vitality left in it. There are so many adventures to be had, and so many places and people to meet/experience. 

At 40, my life is flourishing, but I can’t help but feel like a degenerate loser. Last week I told my sister that I feel like a failure and stupid and a loser, &amp; unaccomplished. I just thought I’d have more and have done more by this point.

Turns out he hated kids. Ironic cuase he became a fearless protector of mine. We traveled all over. He was amazing. I cried. A lot. A whole lot on Friday when he had to leave this world. He whimpered in protest. But it was for him. He was beyond repair.

On the one hand this really helps me regarding standing behind my decisions and being at peace with myself, but on the other hand I am now really stubborn and feel like everyone is trying to influence me and I see them as a threat to my way of thinking. 

Basically my problem is that now I am still thinking about what they want or feel, but I go completely against it like some sort of rebel. When I think like this, which is a lot of the time, I have actual hateful feelings towards people now as I try and fill in their thought patterns after every remark or story. I feel like I should've let go of trying to pinpoint others' thoughts and feelings in stead of not caring about their opinions and judgement. Because once again I'm starting to despise the people around me and that is obviously not what I want.

Has someone else gone through this?
How do I truly stop filling in what others think or feel when I've done this my whole life?",26Mar2019,3

69,"An abstract topic that I believe others should understand to fully appreciate what’s in front of them. When you look behind the curtains of abstraction, every object and situation can be perceived on multiple levels of analyses. And the whole picture in its actuality is an entangled web where each section is only a fragment of time. 

To understand perception we must define the act of perceiving. To perceive something is to: 1) analyze and be consciously aware of what you’re observing. 2) understand that what you’re observing changes across time, affects many other objects, and is tied/connected to many other situations.
For example, when you look at a building you see what is right in front of you, but to truly perceive the entire building you have to conceptualize the underlying layers and the changes that will occur. That building will be different in the next hour, tomorrow, next season, and next year. Even the lighting and time of day affects how how it appears to you. And even then, the space the building occupies is filled with people, plumbing, wires and other things that they themselves change and intertwine with other things infinitely.  

To fully perceive something is to be aware of all its forms and connections. We normally do not perceive objects in this way because it takes too much time and mental resources, but understanding this concept enables you to view the world differently. Since what you see in the present moment is only a slice of what’s real, you are viewing an illusion of reality. You can control your perception of something to not only widen your understanding, but to also move on from any painful experiences. Some situations are brutal and you may have no control over them, but you may be able to shift your perception of the situation to assist you in healing, growing, learning, and moving on. Also on another note, you can perceive your problems differently to help you find solutions. If you consider all of the levels your problem is occupying, you can start from the bottom up and tackle the problems one step at a time. 

I talked a bit about perception in an abstract form, and also how you can get some utility out of that abstraction. Perception is suck a large and complex word that you could never get to the bottom of it, but understanding this aspect of perception gives you a lot of utility when facing current and new problems alike.

72,"So a few years ago I left high school because I had bad acne, anxiety and was depressed. Im not to sure what cause this but I don’t believe it was just one thing. I did have friends when I was in school but when I left i just kind of left school without saying much because i believed it was the best way to go about it. I had a friend that I would kick back n do the same thing every time we met up. So at about this time i moved out of town and after that i only came to see that friend once had a bad experience and just kinda stopped hanging out and talking to him for quiet a while(which now that i look back was a big overreaction) but then months go by I start talking to some old friends from school over ps4 often saying we should hangout again but in the past year and a half never actually doing that. So fast forward to now ive kind of just dropped all of them n do my own thing now. I look at other people with that have found there group of close friends n often tell myself i wish i could have something like that but for me its just like nothing more than a dream to me. (A big disclaimer i have little to no social skill.) I sometimes think that right after i left school it started to get worse for me but it been this way for years but never on the level it is now. I spend most of my time at home since i am home schooled and i get left alone because my mother &amp; sister are at school or work till the afternoon. So when they come home Im usually begging to leave the house to go to the skatepark most times. There I dont really talk to anyone i just do my business and listen to the music on my phone. Yes, i do talk to people sometimes but not often. I never really engage in a full conversation. So I’m writing this to get your peoples advice on what i should do as an “anti-social” &amp; poor socially skilled person who just wants to make close friends? ",26Mar2019,1
73,"On mobile and possibly a rant so excuse formatting/grammar/length

Today something happened that pushed me into a good ole spiral of despair/self hate and a health dose of anxiety.

What happened was genuinely something unremarkable so I’m not going into those details. But it was enough to push me back into the whole I’ve been trying so hard to get out of.

I was diagnosed with avoidant anxiety disorder last year and was told my depression was a side effect of this. I’ve tried to put in effort to change since then. The advice was very clear:

Talk to new people everyday

Now I haven’t talked to new people everyday but the number of people I have initiated conversation with has been fairly high. But they fizzle out so quickly and the people become so averse to interactions afterwards that if anything I have become much more aware of my inept conversation skills. I try different jokes and topics to see what works and what doesn’t. I try to not repeat the same topics between different people. But most of my hobbies are things I enjoy alone. This makes it much harder to find people with similar interests. I have instead been trying to simply be jolly in interactions. Smile more, laugh a bit here and there and the likes because I’ve been told countless times that people don’t approach me because I look serious. 

Now that I’ve tried to change that and make a move myself, it has become awfully transparent that even if I do try I just have too much to learn. So much that I’ll never feel like I am good at conversation. This might purely be my own self esteem screwing me around but that’s probably the point.

I have realised that blaming anyone or anything that happened in my past does nothing except breed negativity. So I have been trying real hard to think about what can I do to change now rather than why I am this way.

But I just want to put these thoughts I’ve been ignoring here because they are a bit too loud today.
-	I would not have been this confused in life if my entire class didn’t bully me by calling me a girl. I tried to ignore but it is difficult to find a safe space when this was the case of the entire class room(we share the same classmates for all classes that year)
-	I would not be this lazy and lack goals if my parents never stopped me whenever I took anything even a little seriously. They would do whatever possible to steer us from interests that they themselves introduced us to if it meant that we won’t have a life which is exactly like theirs. I should learn to sing because I have a good voice. But god forbid I dare actually make it a career. God forbid I read too many books after telling me my entire life that books are the best. 
-	But! Somehow they expected me to be capable of independent thought and will after being pruned my entire life. I get to hear stuff like “I wonder where all our values went” “I sometimes can’t believe this is how you turned out”. Well if you practically spoonfed me instead of teaching responsibility and never let me actually indulge in my hobbies, what did you expect?

Now I’m an unmotivated incapable person trying to find everything wrong with me and also trying to fix whatever I can. I can’t handle failure and criticism for shit. I’d probably jump off a cliff if a group of people decided to roast me because my bitch ass just can’t take it. Or I will just cry my eyeballs out and come out like I’m over all that. 

And after all that I’ve been trying to better myself( I didn’t get into this much but I have gotten into a few hobbies old and new. It has been absolutely great) there are days like today where I just feel like there has been no change in the person that I am. That all that I do doesn’t change the damage and incapability that Is a part of me. I might as well have just convinced myself of this. It might just be my version of reality. Everyone probably doesn’t hate me in reality. But it is just so hard to get out of my hole.

74,"A little under two years ago I was at rock bottom and did some not so good things that landed me in hospital for a bit. I was stressed, I felt like I didn’t belong anywhere, I was in a bad position in school and my relationship with both my boyfriend and family and it felt like the best way to end years of silent suffering. 

After that I was still not the best for a while. I still didn’t know where I belonged and was still in a terrible relationship. But about 8 months ago that ended and after being heartbroken for a bit I had a realisation that I deserved better. 

For some reason, it was my time and I started to clean myself up. I started meditating, exercising, being more social and I was finally happy. It had been so long since I’d been that happy. I never thought I’d finish high school let alone be alive yet here I am in my first semester of uni studying a double degree and planning on working hard to become what I aspire to be. 

Just under two years later and I’m happy. I’m being more social, I’ve started going to yoga, I’m with someone that truely makes me happy and I have close friends that I can talk to about anything. 

Speaking up is hard and I never wanted to for a long time because of fear of many things, but talking about it has seriously helped me, a lot. ",26Mar2019,7
75,"I've been at my current job for about three years now. It's a finance job for a major auto retailer, not going to go into details but they have locations worldwide. In finance, 3-5 years is the first benchmark where you can say you've had enough experience in a low-level position to move up to a higher-level position. People usually jump on this, because a mid-level salary is a lot better than a low-level salary with three years of raises. In fact, it's usually at least twice as much.

And of course, I'd love to make more money. But a new job would disrupt a lot of things I enjoy.

Finance is a cyclical job. Each month, the numbers come in, and you analyze them. Each year, the budgets are created. That means near the beginning of a new month or year, things are pretty hectic. But for most of the rest of the month/year, it's very quiet. I like that a lot. I read, write, or work on personal projects. I listen to a lot of podcasts and work on my D&amp;D campaigns. I'm worries that starting in a new position would add more work, disrupting the things I do to keep myself sane during the workday. Also, the time I spend training would be rough. I would basically go dark on my personal projects for a few months.

Not only that, but my current workplace is close enough that I can bike to work on nice days. Unfortunately, there aren't many finance jobs in this building, meaning I'd either have to switch companies (a hassle) or apply at a different branch of the company (and potentially move out of the country - a huge hassle). At a minimum, I'd be increasing my transportation costs, and in some cases, removing my entire social circle.

All of this has been frustrating my motivation to move up to a better-paying job. My partner and I aren't hurting for cash, but of course more money would help us reach our goals faster. The worst part is that I'm not even that satisfied with my current job - I just like the free time it affords me. And my supervisors seem to appreciate my efforts, but even they are starting to tell me I should be looking at a new position.

I don't know how to convince myself that a new job is worth it. Logically, I think it is. My current job isn't ideal for my skill set, for my financial goals, or for my supervisors. I could move up in the world. But, on the other hand, I like where I am. I like doing what I'm doing. It might be mostly slacking off, but it's nice. It's comfortable.

But at the same time, it's very confusing and frustrating. I don't know if a new job is worth it.",26Mar2019,3

I feel lost in the women’s section. Is that a shirt or a dress? Is that item supposed to over or under something else? I find most items too flimsy, too sheer or cropped oddly.

82,"Here's a not-fully-thought-out idea of how to reform the United States.  Feel free to improve upon it.

Keep the boundaries of the states the way they are, but have a popular vote in which each state decides whether they want to be a member of the Red States of America or the Blue States of America.

Each of the two federations (Red and Blue) will have their own overarching government which will impose different laws.  The Red states will impose conservative laws (e.g., no ban on guns, a ban on abortions, low taxes, minimal social programs, etc) and the Blue States will impose liberal laws (e.g., universal healthcare, higher taxes on the wealthy, more restrictive gun laws, etc.).

A singular Purple Federal government will remain over the two regions, but it will have little function beyond maintaining a United States defense.  The Red and Blue governments should not have their own armies, for obvious reasons.

Every ten years or so, have a popular election which would allow individual states to decide if they want to switch sides (e.g., if the state wants to remain in the Red States of America, or whether it wants to leave and join the Blue States of America.)",26Mar2019,0
83,"I don’t know know how long this story is going to be but I’ll start here;

Hi, my name is Lachlan and I’m 16. A few months ago I expressed concern with my mum that I might have depression since I scored very high on an online depression/ anxiety test (I know it’s dumb to self diagnose yourself, especially online) and my mum wouldn’t believe for a second that there was a chance I had depression or anxiety. But I kept asking her about it and eventually she took me to a GP but only because she thought that if I went then I’d be proven wrong. I went and I was diagnosed with depression, it’s not chemical but the GP that I talked to said I’ve most likely had it for a few years (since around 13 or so) but because I’ve only had 2 appointments each about 30 minutes long my mum still won’t accept that I at the very LEAST have a problem. She’s really hypocritical most of the time, If I went to the appointment and the GP told me that I DIDN’T have depression then my mum would just go “yup told you so” because that’s what she wants to believe. So whatever she won’t take me to get help and my symptoms are only getting worse. A month (I think) ago I started cutting and swiping liquor from the fridge. I don’t know why exactly, but I think it’s because I severely hate myself. My whole life I told everyone that I would never drink alcohol because it has 0 benefits, but now I do it as regularly as I can without being noticed. Sometimes I get sick and it’s normally a mission accomplished for me if I can get to the puking point. One night I got drunk and really emotional so I called a teens help hotline, would never do it again but it kind of helped in the moment I suppose. As for the cutting I chose a really fucking stupid spot which was all up and down the underside of my left arm. It went unnoticed for a week or 2 before I was forced to change to a short sleeved shirt for an event. When my mum did notice it she just got very angry at me and started threatening punishments instead of talking to me about it which is really what I needed. I can’t just go talk to a friend about it either since I’m homeschooled. As for my dad, he walked out last year. But I’ve never been upset about it and I didn’t know why until I was shown an example of a good dad that I realised that I don’t have a single memory of me and my dad bonding once over the 15 years we were living together. Not once. We never played a sport or went to a movie or anything; There was just 0 communication, and that’s fine I guess. I can’t miss what I never owned so I’m just ok with it.

84,"We had been together since I was 18 and I am 26 now. He was my best friend. I feel like I am 90% responsible for it because I was so unhappy with him so for long and had broken up with him multiple times throughout our relationship in the early years. He was diagnosed with cancer early on in our relationship (he is fine now, thank god) and I think it set the tone for our relationship. It started in a bad place. This time though, it was mutual. But it doesn't change how much I care for him and how sad I am. We had been having issues nearly the moment we got married and they never stopped. When he stopped trying, I stopped too. 

But he was a great person. He is caring. He is smart. I felt so much comfort with him. He told me towards the end that he was giving up and that I would need to work to keep us together if I wanted it. But at that point, we both couldn't keep going. We were both tired. And I feel so regretful that I let it happen. He said really hurtful things to me, but that was only after years of what seemed to be a loveless relationship. It does seem like it was the right thing to do because I don't think I would ever feel fulfilled with him. That's what he said anyway. And I understand why. And at this point, there is no going back. We have filed the papers. We live separately. I saw that his dad removed me from Facebook.

I dreamt last night that we were trying to work on things and he sent a photo of us to his dad. He responded negatively, and so I asked if his family hated me. He said yes, and that everyone hated me. He started listing off all of my friends as well. I dream things like this every night. I'm so tired. I feel like dying. I wouldn't do that to my cats or my family, but if I didn't have them, who knows. I feel so full of regret, even knowing that this is the right thing to do. I'm tired of crying.

Freshman year of college, I met this guy on tinder. 
Let’s call him Shane. We met up at a bar and talked for a couple of months but he told me that he didn’t feel a connection so we stopped talking. While we were talking however, he would frequently tell me about his roommate and how his roommate liked a lot of the things I did. I thought this was odd considering the circumstances. But when we stopped talking, I went back on tinder and found his roommate. I swiped and we matched instantly. I thought this was funny; I had only met him once at Shane’s house but it was dark so I didn’t know if he had seen what I’d actually looked like. Let’s call him Arthur. Arthur messaged me and he told me he knew who I was but that it didn’t bother him. We met up and I quickly realized he looked nothing like the pictures I had seen of him on tinder. I was not physically attracted to him at all. Despite that, we talked all winter break. A week before school started I knew I needed to end it. I told him I needed to focus on school and I tried to end it right there. He told me it was ok and we continued to be friends. From that point on, it has been a year of being on and off friends. He was afraid of Shane finding out so we stopped talking for a couple months, then he snap chatted me right before summer. He asked me about our relationship status around my birthday in the summer after me telling him countless times that everything we did, for me, was just physical. Then we had a class together in the fall but during winter break we had a falling out again because he wanted to be together and I didn’t. Now here we are, we had a class this spring semester and have been friends since February. This time has been different though. We see each other so much more and I find myself actually missing him. I lost my virginity to him ( I wanted to get it over with) last year but I never felt that connected to him. We have a great mental and emotional connection and I consider him a really great friend. This is why I’ve never cut him off completely. I love spending time with him and he makes me really comfortable. A week ago we did an open mic together. It really changed the way I saw him. My mom told me I could move past the fact that I’m not physically attracted to him because she can see great chemistry between us. Last night I really let myself feel and I was really affectionate. ( I’m horrible with expressing emotion. I don’t like hugs or pda ) This guy is attached to me. He tells me I’m the most gorgeous person he knows and I’d be the perfect person to be with. He tells me he feels something real with me. And I think I love him. But I am not physically attracted to him. At all. And that’s what sucks. I would date him in a heartbeat if I thought he was cute. I get feelings that I haven’t felt in a long time with him and I almost told him I loved him. He would definitely take the wrong way so I can never tell him unless I wanted to date him. Fuck me.

Our culture told us to raise our parents when they are old and incapable. You both are still capable but not shouldering the responsibility you owe even to yourselves as adults, but I have been in the past few years, in my twenties. I pondered the purpose of my existence and hell,what did I think I was brought to life for. None other than an senior-living investment. Before I was even three, you both threw away the responsibility to actually raise the child you chose to have, and when you had to bear this burden of me being a toddler, you exhibit nothing but chaos of humanity - violence, sloth, anger, indulgence, hostility. Perhaps I induced this side of your personality simply by existing as a helpless child around you. I don't hold the grudge on you two anymore for the history, yet you are still the same at the start of your senior age. You only stayed together in this toxic relationship and stunted your own growth because you both are afraid of living through and for yourselfs. And I'm going to start. ",26Mar2019,1

I was curious at how bad some men can be a texting and wanted to see for myself, so I decided to make a Grindr and see. And holy shit. It's just filth. 

I've only been using Grindr for ~5 hours and I'm already fed up with the guys on there. I severely underestimated how many guys start a conversation with ""Hey"" or ""What's up"" or other generic starters. Horrible pictures and bad framing. Not to mention the bad grammar galore, and straight up dick pics after I say ""Hello"". And just a bombardment of notifications. It never ends.

If I could only last less than a third of a day I can't imagine what it must be like to be a woman on those apps.

Guys, we can do better.

On the flip side I made a Bumble and I'm getting similar generic starters from women, but at least it's grammatically correct and personal.",26Mar2019,1

I felt broken and defeated and their suggestion was  to exercise or start a business.  


HUH?!!  


After hearing these annoying suggestions 3000 times, i took their advice in hopes of getting a taste of the kool-aid they were drinking and started to exercise.

It took a few months but i noticed that i began to feel empowered: happy and open-minded and willing to deal with my issues.

113,"Growing up I always wanted my hair to be really long, and it was most of the time. My dad was part Cherokee and he always had long hair and used to braid it. I adored my dads hair. But he wasn’t in my life, I only saw him on “visits” now and then when he wasn’t in prison. So I guess, sort of subconsciously, I thought that having long hair would make me close to him in someway. I don’t know. But as I became an adult I realized the long hair was becoming a lot of work. I didn’t like washing it, and brushing it out, long strands were always all over my clothes and body, and I could feel them in my butt crack whenever I took a shower (ladies with long hair you know exactly what I’m talking about), and whenever I was with someone in bed they would accidentally lay on my hair and make me uncomfortable. I wore my hair up 90% of the time and it was just getting old. So I thought about cutting my hair for a few years, at least two. I know that sounds like a long time but this was a big deal to me and was going to be a shock to everyone. My inspiration was Ann Hathaway and Emma Watson. I cut my hair in steps, every few months I would go shorter and shorter until I finally had the courage to do a pixie. I got a lot of comments from family and friends that LOVED my new look and told me all the time that I really pulled it off. I loved my hair as well, and I have no regrets. But I’ve had my hair cut for about a year now and I’ve noticed that I am in fact treated differently out in the world. This might sound conceded, but I used to get hit on my guys pretty often. Now, men don’t seem to notice me at all. Not in a romantic way. And all of the girls I work with have sort of cliqued up and go shopping together and have brunches. But I am never invited, and my girlfriends from the past have all but abandoned me. Cutting my hair was an experience for me that made me come into myself and I don’t know if maybe I intimidate people now? I should also mention I got my septum pierced in the last year as well, so I think my look is really putting people off. I look at old pictures of me and wonder if I actually looked better with long hair, and if I should just let it grow back. I ask myself if fitting in is worth the annoyances that comes with having long hair. 

Ladies that have a pixie cut, have you noticed people treating you differently since you got your hair cut? 

I see other girls with styles like mine and think “how cute!” And it makes me feel like I did the right thing. Maybe cutting my hair changed ME, as a person, and that’s what’s putting people off? My confidence? 

Is it silly of me to want to grow out my hair again so I can just blend in with the crowd? ",26Mar2019,19

$48 an hour is the wage that must be made in order to make six figures $100k a year. I believe this is the optimum amount of money accumulation as Warren Buffett caps his own personal salary at $100k a year. 

There are few jobs that make $48/hr. They have to provide multiple things in order to create the level of value production in order to justify $48/hr. These include:

1. Convenience
2. Skill
3. Timeliness
4. Feeling of luxury and good vibes

A few things hit these specifications. Masseuses make $48/hr, coders make $48/hr, movers and heavy lifters working on their own make $48/hr. In essence, creating a service that produces a positive and relaxed state of mind for the customer, and they will gladly pay you that $48/hr. 

Summer is better for moving, winter is better for coding, be your own boss keep 100% of the value creation and create a sustainable solution.

133,"Nothing harmful or anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I feel sad about something (commonly stuff about my relationship), I tend to strive and do things I normally wouldn't do if I was feeling neutral.

  
A good example would be times where I start to doubt my relationship (feeling like she's (18F) going to leave me, cheat on me, get tired of me, etc.), I have this strange urge to come back to the violin. I used to play it a lot back in elementary and middle school. I get motivated for some strange reason. I listen to violin music in the car, watch other performers, etc. I imagine myself aspiring to be a virtuoso one day. 

&amp;#x200B;

But then when I'm reassured about my relationship (she tells me she loves me, says that she won't leave me or cheat on me, or get tired of me), the motivation disappears. It disappears when my doubts go away and when I'm happy in my relationship again. 

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't only apply to violin. Sometimes I catch myself reading a book (current one that I'm reading is called, ""13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do""), or wanting to exercise, or actually planning ahead for my future for college.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Me sad = motivated to do things I wouldn't normally do when feeling neutral.

A boy in her class randomly tackled her while screaming loudly in her ear. My niece grabbed the scissors, which have rubber over the sharp ends, and made a cutting motion toward his chest. She has said she was scared and apologized many times. Both children had their families alerted and the teacher has recommended therapy for my niece only. She believes my niece acted overtly aggressive and could pose a potential threat to students in the future. 

My family thinks therapy is not needed for her but will likely make her an appointment to satisfy the teacher.

139,"A little background, I'm 23 years old, and I was diagnosed with anxiety in high school. I have a small group of friends, but I like to stay in the same routine. I was talking to one of my friends about my daily routine, because we were having a deep conversation about both of our anxiety issues.

He said, ""Do you have OCD also? Sometimes I have to wash my hands for minutes after I pee before I feel clean."" I had to tell him my biggest secret, someone that I've never told anyone. I said, ""I've actually never peed before. I know it's something you're supposed to do, but I guess I just kinda never had the time."" He was stunned by my revelation. ""You've never peed before?!?!"" Maybe it's because he had a fascination with urine or maybe it was just because I had never told him that before, but he was amazed that someone had not experience urinating. “You NEED to try it. In fact, let’s go to the bathroom. I’m going to teach you how to pee.”

He walked me into the bathroom, and taught me how to lift up the toilet seat. He took my hand and arranged my fingers on the stem of my cock. “Relax, it’s easier than it looks. Here, watch me do it.” He pulled out his cock and started pissing into the toilet. “Just relax the muscles in your crotch, and focus on the sensations inside the penis. Whenever you feel a force coming outward of the penis, focus on it but don’t try to control it. If you feel it moving inward, then recognize it, and relax the muscles again until it’s moving outward.” I followed the instructions and nothing happened. I said, “I can’t help it. I feel the force. It’s moving back up. I’ll never pee, I should just give up.”

“You got this, just relax. Don’t play mind games with yourself, you will pee before I let you leave this bathroom. If you don’t think you will pee, then no pee will come out. Trust me, you just have to believe in yourself.” I tried again, and pee started spraying out of my cock. ""I'm doing it! I'm urinating!""

I peed for 5 straight minutes. He said, ""How do you like it?"" I politiely asked him to leave the bathroom so I could be alone with my piss stream. I wiped the tip of my cock with a single square of toilet paper, and flushed. ""I am a new man today,"" I thought. I ran over and hugged my friend in the most intense display of platonic affection I had ever experience. My pants were sprinkled with wet spots and urine continued to drip down my leg. My friend saw the urine marks on my pants, ""Don't worry about that. You'll get the hang of it soon."" We fell asleep together on the couch in his apartment.",26Mar2019,0

Got the surgery this Monday, and my nose is completely closed. Mouth breathing 24/7. I'm getting the stints removed this Friday morning, and I'm literally counting seconds as we speak.

Worst feeling ever, and I've been through a few operations..

143,It felt so fucking great. All the things I did was meant to make the audience laugh and I literally cracked them up. It feels great knowing the thing wanted to achieve succeeded but a thousand times better. I can still feel the adrenaline coming out of my body. Now im gonna have a good night rest :),26Mar2019,14
144,"Not longdrop obviously, have never had the personal space to allow it and didn't want to do it in public due to sadness over a stranger having to discover the body.  Getting over that hurdle.  Planning on doing it ""soon"" - the hard part is getting the knot right when mechanically inept, because the snap will be instant if longdropped.  The longdrop is just like a fallride at Disneyland or whatever.

Anyway, if I don't stimulate my left-carotid regularly, I start to get really weird moods.  Like a craving for it.  There are some people who seem to be aware of this need instinctually, and can do social gestures that make me feel like they just stimulated it a bit for me.",26Mar2019,1
145,"Hi , I'm 21 years old male. I have always thought I'm quite handsome by looking at myself in the mirror, but at the same time hated the way I look in the photos. Now after a bit of searching online and rethinking, I've realized that the photos are actually showing us the real picture. Quite simply because when I look at someone's photo , I don't see any difference between the way he/she looks in the real life.  
And now , I have lost all the confidence I had. As it turns out , most of those eye contacts with girls I had in my life weren't because of my looks. Probably I had something in my teeth or a mustard stain on my shirt. On the other hand, at least I know how I look now so I ain't fooling myself no more.  
There are couple of reasons why I have posted this. The main one would be to find someone who could comfort me and make me feel better. Also let's say I wanted to enlighten people who might not have known this before.

I might have been wrong on this , but very unlikely. I wish I have though.  
Thank you for reading and I apologize for not being word-perfect in English. Hopefully this doesn't ruin your day.

146,"First, a little background: I've been with my boyfriend for 9 years. The relationship has been good, we rarely fight, and things have been pretty harmonious. A couple of years ago we bought a house and we have been saving up for a wedding. 

When I got my most recent job last September we decided to combine our finances. We had previously kept separate accounts and I would just pay him my share of the bills, and we would both buy groceries and household essentials. I decided just to have my check direct deposited into his account until we could open a joint account. 

Since we both worked kind of opposite schedules and we both had to be present to do a joint account, that never happened. About a month ago I lost my job due to a merger. I didn't qualify for unemployment because I hadn't been working there long enough. I immediately started applying for jobs and sending out resumes. Luckily I had a good tax return which would keep the pressure off for a few months. 

2 weeks ago I went to Walmart and bought some things that we needed. The total was $230. A few days later when he checked the account he FLIPPED and demanded to know exactly what I bought. I had just woken up and couldn't come up with a detailed list off the top of my head and he just got angrier. Now I need to note here that this purchase in no way effected our ability to pay  bills or anything like that. And it's not like I was out buying a bunch of unnecessary items. He's gotten a little upset about money management issues before, but he does not do the shopping and doesn't understand how much things really cost. I've told him that, I've showed him receipts, but his brain still seems to think that prices are the same as they were 15 years ago. 

Anyway, after this ""discussion"" he takes my debit card. It has his name on it. He told me that when we or I needed things we would go to the store together. I told him to fuck off because my money was in the account too. My tax return and a payment of $500 for a one off IT job that I did for someone. He hid the card and refused to give me any cash. 

A few days ago I told him that we needed a few things from the grocery store, but couldn't get his ass out of the house to go to the store to get anything. 

I got the debit card back today after a week of not having any access to money. I think he realized what a complete and total piece of shit he was being, and that withholding money from a significant other is financial abuse. This whole situation has me freaked out. This is the first time in 9 years that he's been mean or controlling in any way.

I have job interviews lined up, and I have a check coming for another odd job that I did. I'm going to open my own bank account with that check. The thing that was most upsetting about this whole ordeal wasn't the money, I can get by on very little. It was losing access to freedom and autonomy. If I wanted to go see a friend for a cup of coffee while he was at work I couldn't. If I needed a personal item when he wasn't around I couldn't get it. I couldn't even get a fucking gallon of milk when we had been out of it for 2 days. It's humiliating to have to ask someone for money to buy basic essentials and it made me feel like some old timey housewife humbly submitting to her husband for the goddamn grocery money. 

I don't really know where to go from here. It's going to take some work on his part for me to trust him again. Once I get a job I'm going to start squirreling away some money, just in case.

Anyhow, ladies and gentlemen of Reddit, don't ever let yourself get into a situation like I did where your money is going into an account that doesn't bear your name. I thought it would be fine because I trusted him and because we had intended to open a joint account. Don't ever put yourself in a situation where someone can cut off your access to your money.",26Mar2019,53
147,"History Professor here. Apparently...humiliating others? Lol

8 of us went out for drinks one night last week. Tempers flared, egos got involved.

Trivial pursuit was the game. History professors vs science professors. 4 on 4. The most senior science professor laid down the gauntlet.

""Let us bet more than monetary value. The losers will place on the line their very honor and dignity! If you are so confident, let us agree the victors will watch the losers run across the quad at midnight...naked as the day they were born, exposed as the fools they are, literally and figuratively, for all to gaze upon!""""

He bet his colleagues clothes, and they lost miserably haha. Never did I even break a sweat about colleagues seeing what type of bra I wear lol.

Students missed out on 4 incredibly intelligent, highly dignified, very respected, completely nude and blushing science professors streaking across the green lawn.

I won't name them, but one is a 52 year old male with a ""dad bod"". His pot belly exposed to the world.

The other, a 33 year old male nerd with a surprisingly cute, round ""bubble butt"" jiggling behind him to our epic delight.

A 44 year old female, in surprisingly good shape actually eccept for a pudgy slight belly she'sbeen hiding under her pantsuits, holding her big breasts like they were precious jewels.

And finally our freshest face, a 27 year old geek girl with a short haircut and a nearly flat chest.

All were confident. All were stripped and sent running bare.

It's good to know history lol.

Is it bad that I enjoyed this? Why did I feel such POWER from it?? And how do I work with these people from now on without mentally stripping them down to their birthday suits every time I see them now??

Tl;dr science professors made a bet and had to run BUCK NAKED",26Mar2019,0

149,"im gonna make this short and sweet because i dont want to type for 15 mins and people dont want to read for 15 minutes. my 'taste' changed so often, it's unbelievable. i regret buying 95% of what i buy, sometimes even before it comes to my house. im basically confused on what i really like and what i dont, and it's tearing me apart because i feel like i waste my money on every purchase i make and i can never enjoy anything. the only things that i find fun now a days are adrenaline boosters, which is often illegal and dangerous.  every time i start something, i scrap it before i finish because i dont want it / like it anymore. there are two solutions i thought of but both are unrealistic. 1) dont buy anything (obviously bad). 2) be rich and buy everything (obviously impossible). i know this is gonna sound stupid but sometimes, i wish i were completely broke. i used to be completely broke and i never had this feeling, since i got what i got and that was it. **if anyone wants more details or has any questions, lmk. i hope this makes any sense what so ever.**",26Mar2019,1
150,"Bra shopping can be an absolute chore, none of the ones in my size look appealing, and it feels like I'm carrying around unnecessary weight on my chest.

I can see why it helps some women feel confident about their bodies (I also feel this way to a degree, but I'm more concerned with staying thin), but other than that, they're a nuisance.

152,"Well not everything. But I’ve (23f) been at my new job for 2 weeks after being unemployed for 5 months. I was running out of funds and had to get something quick so I was only spending money on things I needed. Before dating my current bf, I was paying my exes’ way and things he needed bc he was broke and never wanted to do anything which is understandable. But when we broke up, after months of me putting gas, buying him food and borrowing money, he suddenly had money to have fun and do whatever he wanted. I was a little upset but we weren’t together anymore so I got over it. The guy I was seeing after that, I offered to pay for his food the first time out of courtesy because I don’t want to seem like I’m a girl so you must pay for me. But after that, he kept volunteering me to pay for his shit. We weren’t even exclusive and I asked what he’ll do for me or that he got me next time. We were at the gas station and he said it’s rude to count favors and the stupid fuck gas attendant agreed. Whatever, stopped seeing him for other reasons. NOW I’m with my bf of 7 months, he pays sometimes but I think it’s shitty that he’ll ask me to pay for things when he knows I’m low on funds, I haven’t had a job and he has. I always pay because I’m embarrassed to seem broke. Today we’re going to the movies ($5 tuesdays) and we’re supposed to go eat before that. I bought the movie tickets and when I mentioned going out to eat he said to eat at home and he’ll see me later. I’m over it. Idk why I even offered to pay but it never seems 50/50 anymore..
