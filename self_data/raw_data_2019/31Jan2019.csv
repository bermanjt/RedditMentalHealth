0,"I joined twitter a while ago and stopped posting it because it just feels like me talking to myself!

I made tweets but nobody interacted with me because nobody followed me. I tried talking to the people I followed but I likely just got a like or nothing at all. I don't understand how you're supposed to use or like twitter if you're not already super popular, a talented artist or politician, or hot and post constant selfies of yourself.

This is the same with all follower based websites. Plus all of that creepy shit about them selling off your personal info (never touching facebook) but that's where everybody is at right now.

Forums, and I guess reddit is a forum too, everybody is pretty much neutral because your popularity doesn't determine how far your posts go, just if they're good or interesting. You can be a nobody and have a conversation with other nobodies or somebody with a following already because you're all on equal ground... I don't understand why forums aren't as popular as follower based social media.

Idk, maybe I'm just using twitter wrong? I'm just a plain average human so I doubt I will get anyone to be interested in me. I noticed tumblr is really unpopular now for a new rule change and people are looking for a new site to join. So I was thinking I could make a forum based social media site that wouldn't sell people's personal info. But of course I don't know anything about programming so it's not gonna happen

1,"So having anxiety is still pretty new to me, I'm trying to figure out the triggers and anything to help get passed it.

So here's my life story...

To start out with I am now 28 and this all started at 26. I was still in college (my last year) and it was my last year on my parent health insurance. My mom wanted me to get a physical and to get some stuff checked out because my eyes had a yellow tinge to them. I apparently had this for a couple years, pretty close to the time I moved out to go to school. I never had a medical history and felt perfectly healthy. My blood work came back and I had high bilirubin levels. I then got an ultrasound which showed nothing and had about 6 viles of blood taken (my first time getting blood drawn and I ended up passing out afterwards) I found out everything was functioning fine, so I was diagnosed with Gilberts Disease which my gastro doctor explained is basically nothing except I can get a yellow tinge in the eyes because I have natural high bilirubin levels. 

Ever since this whole process, I have had some bad anxiety. I have never had anxiety and always been a laid back guy, so the fact that I have anxiety all of a sudden is shocking to me. I can get anxiety just sitting in the car, going out to meet friends, and recently, driving over tall bridges. This now frightens me because I want to travel to see a friend but I am afraid if I fly my anxiety will get so bad I could have a panic attack. I have never gotten that bad but I also don't want to push it. I recently moved to PA for temporary work where my anxiety was really bad at times but I think that could be related to being out on my own away from everyone I know in unfamiliar territory. I am home now but I still get it randomly. I went to see an old boss of my to chat and I felt like I was going to pass out for about 20 minutes before I was fine. 

This is very frustrating for me because anytime I do something I think, ""will this trigger my anxiety?"" I try not to think about it but it is hard not to. I used to get it real bad when I went out to eat with friends but that was when I was a hermit so I went out more often out of frustration and it eventually went away. I am still a bit of a hermit but I am always working and paycheck to paycheck so I can't really go out much at all.  I have recently stopped drinking coffee and started to learn how to meditate to see if that helps as well. 

I'm curious to see if anyone here can relate and/or give some advice on how to get rid of this crap. ",31Jan2019,1

6,"My gf and I have been having quite a few arguments and fights, they all have been leading back to her telling me that things I do make her feel unloved, unwanted, not protected etc. How our problems usually go is just identify the problem (which most of the time is me doing something) and then telling her I will fix it. Then I do something else, that is different to what I last did, but she still links it all back to feeling unloved, unwanted etc. And that I keep making the same mistakes.

This was also a trend in my last long term relationship and I’m starting to have serious doubts on my ability to be in a relationship as I feel I do pretty well at fixing our problems together, then I do something else and it creates the loop. We had a week recently where everyday I did something and we almost broke up. Yet now that we got through that and our fights happen occasionally, I just feel like I’m always doing something wrong and somewhat disinterested.

A normal person would shrug it off and go next but for some reason I'm compelled to keep hoping. It's dumb I know and I'll probably only get hurt but there is something about him that makes me want to try. And no this isn't some teen angst I'm almost 30!

16,"## I had a wonky undergrad because of my father's illness (3 years) and passing. I had to transfer schools and take time off twice to help care for him. I can graduate this summer but with a meh degree (psych BA). Should I stay longer to get a fancier degree (i.e. honors? a minor?) or graduate &amp; work?

\*\*a little more background:

Wanted to go Ivy undergrad but didn't believe in myself so ended up not even applying...ended up at a top liberal arts to start but had to transfer to big state school due to cancer diagnosis. Really wanted another shot at Ivy/top school for grad school but not sure if that's a pipe dream at this point because of my zigzaggy college years...

Financially: I am \*very\* blessed that I do not need to start working necessarily--have a college fund that will help with any more undergrad/possible grad school.

I am wondering what looks better to **potential top employers/top grad schools**: taking a long time to finish undergrad (5-6 years total..!) with a nicer degree? Or the typical 4 year time with a mediocre one (I guess w/ a personal statement about why...) and not many extracurriculars either (due to caring for my father).

17,"Idk 
Im polar some moments like work make me feel like a tool who is antisocial and annoying and where everyone gets screwed cause some manager gives his friends the good treatment
As for me im just alone suffering in my own little bubble.
At school though i feel great when i learn and get things right it motivates me to leave that infernal workshop where “everyone” practically insults and doesnt respect me. Im scared alone nervous mad sad everything all in one
its just weird i fucked up college badly luckily im doing better so maybe just maybe i can get that degree and get 9-5 job that pays good and supports my life so i can lastly get old help people as i wanted to in my dreams then die in some place alone forgotten while giving back

Im simply lackluster in personality i keep being mocked mistreated and disrespected but now i think that this is aREALLY good motivator in ditching this shitty job for a career. ill miss their charisma and i guess wise crack jokes and realism of reality but i guess im old for that especially since they keep emphasizing to the max that ihave been here for 3years like I don’t know
I think they have my reddit 
But idc anymore i just want my life my me back when everything was good
And i hope to make that a reality 
And yet
A person such as myself just keeps on being put down whether it be work college or at home my life isnt the best and im sure others have even worse problems i just wish i could turn. Back time to the good old days WHILE changing the depressing moments and more so on being a happier me:)
Life is pain there is not one day where i dont feel sad

22,"So basically, the idea is that you judge other people and you also judge yourself. 

For example I hate myself for being short, and when I see shorter people I begin to feel a little better and honestly think I'm better than them... So I also feel like tall people look down on me (no pun intended)

I feel ugly and then I see someone who's just really weird looking, I feel better about myself and also feel like I'm better than them. So I think attractive people look down on me. 

I'm a delinquent so I carefully think about my actions and words in front of people, at the same time I will look at people and judge them as studious or delinquent. So I think smart people look down on me. 

So I'm basically judging everyone I see, and in return I feel as if I'm being judged. I don't know if this is normal, like the minds way of keeping you out of danger or something, but I'm not happy that I'm so judgmental. I grew up in a bitter, angry family. Often fights and quarrels and just dysfunctional behavior. I've had my fair share of abuse and failures. I'll treat my friends well but in my mind I tend to hate people I don't know. And I guess I have the irrational fear that they might hate me.

They shut our water off at 1:30 in the goddamn morning last night (after specifically stating they wouldn’t, but if they had to, would let us know. They didn’t.) because they didn’t want to deal with drilling holes in the neighbors ceiling. Today it was -40°F with windchill (very very unusual for my area, as the lowest I’ve seen in my lifetime is MAYBE -20°F. And that was a horrible winter.)

25,"TLDR; After years of not seeing a dermatologist because of constant disappointment with their “hit and miss” approaches on me, finally seen one today in hopes to get more satisfying answers to my skin questions. Dermatologist looked at my face only and told me she’s just gonna prescribe antibiotic,see me in 2 months and left. 


Tis gonna be long read/rant so bear with me.. and with my English as this is my not my native language. And this is how today’s story goes..

I went to a dermatologist appointment today after so many years of avoiding it considering my ample experience with dermatologists who kept giving me the same spiel about my skin. It has been six years or so since I’ve seen one and I swore to myself not to waste my time again with them just to be given a “hit or miss” procedures/options about what works best with me. I had a horrible experiences with derma leaving me with big scars/skin trauma that seem to be permanent so I had too much apprehension about going to one since then. Not until my husband persuaded me to make an appointment again since I got a really bad break out almost 2 years ago and because I complained a lot about the blemishes.

I take full responsibility and blame to whatever happened to my face so all throughout these years, I figure things out about my skin regimes and remedies all by myself only. Some things work, some things don’t but my full controlled regimes helped my skin a lot so I don’t breakout that easily anymore. However, 2 months ago my husband was able to persuade me to book an appointment with one and somehow made me comfortable with the idea esp that I’m just left with mostly scarring.

Today, I went in there with my husband with my hopes high especially after years of rejecting the said option, plus hubby was confident that the specialist will be able to tell me clearly what is wrong with my face and as to how I’m breaking out even with varied regimes and diets tried. We spent some time in the reception about payment options to figure out how we’re gonna pay for it through our insurance. Lady was helpful but couldn’t figure out what’s wrong in her computer so she sent my papers in the office and had me waited to be called while she still figure things out.

I sat anxiously and I then I was finally called by the nurse. The nurse asked me 1-2 questions about my history and I happily answered and explained my situation before. She was clearly uninterested and just asked me to stay still as she takes my photo. So as someone who has too much expectations about the appointment, I politely asked her if she wants me to clear up my face as I had put on some bb cream and she just said no need and that the dr should be in in few minutes then she left. 

I waited for 10 minutes in the office.. happy.. settled with the thoughts that I will finally be able to get a good answer from a specialist or maybe at least get an input from her as to what I’m doing wrong.. esp here in US..
then the doctor came followed by her nurse..
She introduced herself kind of in hurry and started talking as to how I am here for my acne and that she sees some pimple in my chin and I might be very sore and that she is gonna prescribe me some antibiotics...

I waited for her to tell me more and she continued that our antibiotics should be stronger than the ones I had before. She was just looking at my face the entire time and never even tried looking further to at least check whether I only have dark spots or active acne. I then started giving her more information about how my face settled with my current regime and the breakout started last week after 2 good months of no pimples and she just nodded. She was plainly disinterested about my back story and I immediately got that. I wanted to ask more about my situation but she seemed done at the moment and gave me a look like “are you finish?”.

She was definitely in hurry and just settled with the idea of prescribing an oral antibiotics and seeing me again after 2 months. She might have thought that I would feel better when she said she usually sees her patients after 6 months prior to initial consultation. 

As someone whose hopes are so high, who’s opened myself after years of closed doors to be scrutinized again by a professional , stalled at the moment as I wanted to hear more from that less than 5 minutes conversation..

After realizing that she is not interested about touching me, looking at my face longer than it has been, hearing more questions from me nor answering any of it, she bid goodbye and handed me the paper to give to the reception lady to pay.

I called my husband back to pick me up and that moment I wanted to cry. I tried to compose myself at the moment as I try to fill out the paper that says we need to pay hundreds of dollars for that less than 5 minutes of very sad and disappointing consultation. 

As we got into the car, I expressed to my husband that it was not worth it..  and then I found myself crying for that unexpected disappointment. I calmly explained to him that although I’ve gotten to see the dermatologist, I did not expect to get the same approach as I had before and be shooed away in that manner. I took it personally and the phrase “I told you so” kept knocking on my head. I sobbed and swore to myself one more time.. never again.. 

My husband was empathetic about it and I feel like I still need to explain why it was a big deal for me. As someone who has been suffering this kind of ordeal for almost a decade now; who has undergone various criticism about my face, getting mocked by it, whose self esteem suffered a lot, it was not easy to set your hopes high again to someone whom you thought could help you apart from yourself. This situation that keeps happening again and again affirms my beliefs that these specialists do things out of their convenience and pay and not because they care or are concerned about people who suffer acne or other problems like me.

Today’s consultation broke my heart.. my trust in their field even more.. and my self esteem once more..

Here’s the deal.. I do see my provider regularly but I just lost hope about seeing or finding a reliable dermatologist in my life anymore.. ",31Jan2019,1

34,"I’m just kinda looking to rant here so for my first reddit post, I just need advice or someone to talk to that understands what I feel.

I’m a 18 yr old male(19 on Saturday!) that’s currently studying criminology at a university just east of Toronto, Ontario. In late June 2018, my father was hit by a car while on his motorcycle. He had very terrible injuries( lost a leg, nerve damage to his arm only allows him to use 30% of his capabilities, lost vision in one eye, amongst others). He was in a coma for 3 weeks, where he woke up not remembering what had happened to him. Everyday I wake up and there’s about 5 minutes of bliss where I’m not anxious, just chilling talking to my roommate. Then I start to become sad and anxious having memories of my mom calling me telling me my father may not live until the morning. Memories of walking into the hospital m, seeing a man I said ‘bye dad, I’ll see you after work’ not 12 hours earlier, with a tube down his throat, motionless, lifeless. He survived the accident, and 6 months later is now home, bound to a wheelchair until he can learn to walk again, as he lost one of his legs so he needs a prosthetic. He said to me one day...”the world isn’t designed for a person with one leg, but it’s really not designed for a person with one arm.” 

The hardest part of this whole tragedy is that I feel guilty. He wanted nothing more than to go throw a baseball, go for a bike ride, etc...and I never went with him, because I wanted to go be with my friends, or play Xbox. I feel that’s why I’m always so upset, knowing that all he wanted to do was do these things with me, and now he really can’t.

I just want to ask the man driving the car, was going a little fast worth all of this pain? 

Love you dad, and I’m sorry for not taking those opportunities to bond with you. I don’t think I’ll ever really forgive myself.

Her back was arched and her feet were crooked from walking barefoot for such a very, very, so very long time. They were so crooked that when my mom gifted her shoes, she was unable to wear them as they hurt her feet very much. 

She made a living walking for miles until she reached the open market where she would buy what she could. She would then haul her burden barefoot back to where she came from, selling what she could on the way. 

She was old, white haired and missing teeth, carrying her wares on her back, but she would always wear a bright smile and a cheerful demeanor. You wouldn't know her sad story looking at her smile. 

My mom was heavily pregnant with me when it happened. There was a huge tropical storm and the unforgiving rains were particularly bad. My mom was worried for the old woman, knowing she had no one left in the world. Her husband and all of her children had died over the years leaving her all alone in the world. War is a terrible thing. Government turning on their citizens for foreign interests is worse. At least for her, it was - though I don't know that she ever said it. 

So my mom set off to find her after the storm had passed, walking around with me heavy in her belly, as she was reaching the end of her pregnancy. She asked everyone she could about her until she was directed to an old, destitute house where this old woman lived in a made shift tent of cardboard boxes propped up on the back wall. 

That's where she found her cold lifeless body. A silent end to a kind woman who suffered more than anyone should have to. 

I was named after this person. Her name is a tribute to an angel in the Christian Bible. It means God is my strength. And somehow she wore her name well. She had nothing, nothing but strength and faith. 

I hope to live up to her memory.

I remember her always. 

May she rest in peace. ",31Jan2019,1

My wife has said this now for sometime but to be recently called out on it from my girlfriend, I’m seriously starting to wonder. I have a steady even felt emotion. I don’t get overly happy or sad. I’d say it’s a more feeling upbeat or melancholy at best. It has been this way for most of my adult life. I do however remember the times of excitement when I was younger and the happiness it gave me. I remember the extreme love I had for my Mother as a child-teens. I also remember the sadness I felt when my Grandfather died when I was nine. I joined the Marine Corps at 18 and served until 28 years old. Majority of this time was spent between Iraq and Afghanistan serving as an 0311 Rifelman (Infantry). So I have first hand knowledge of war. Having lived it through most of my twenties, death, destruction was common in my life. It simply became another day on the job. Nothing can shock me. Nothing can break my even mood. I have tried. I pushed the envelope in many areas of my life with the hope of feeling something. Could it be possible I lack Empathy because of trauma/life experiences and in fact I’m not a socio or psychopath?

39,"I’m a single man in my late 20’s and I’m only now understanding the source of my insecurity and self-loathing: I am a dull person.
 
The strangest thing is that I once believed that clear thinking and communication was my strength, identifying as the Myers Briggs type ENTP and choosing philosophy as my degree field. But in hindsight I realise I was deluded. 

The last few years I’ve become aware that I have difficulty thinking clearly about even simple topics. My mind seems to strain when dealing with things that flow naturally for others and it takes time for me to organise a jumble of words inside my head. I often miss the point that someone is trying to make when talking and I lose track of fast-moving conversations very easily, especially in groups. Often when I read or hear a sentence, at the end of it my mind remains blank. I hear the words inside my head, but it’s as if no meaning was registered and only after a period of deliberate, strained thought do I understand it. Peers at work and uni haven’t appeared to have this issue.

I’m coming to think that this problem is the root of what holds me back in life: the reason I’m not outgoing, why I avoid interactions with strangers and the reason I’m not a joy to be around. I can’t think of the right thing to say, and when they get to know me people often tell me I’m weird. 

Generally I find it very hard to relate to most other people and in groups it feels like they’re tuned to the same frequency, while I’m an awkward outsider. I sense my awkwardness makes other people uncomfortable and this makes me even more self-conscious and awkward. I now realise I’ve been subconsciously avoiding people my whole life to protect myself from the inevitable sting of rejection.

I used to think it was because I was fat, poor and wore glasses that the kids at my elite school didn’t like me. I’m now none of these things but still feel like I’m a low social status person. My new perspective is that it’s because I’m dull. You can’t be spontaneous and pithy if you’re straining during simple interactions; you can’t be interesting if you’re mind’s always blank.

I’ve read a lot of advice which says do stuff to make yourself more interesting so you have more to talk about. So I saved up and went travelling in South America, but I still don’t feel like I have anything interesting to say. It’s like the experience was wasted on me. 

I don’t believe it’s depression induced brain-fog because things have been going relatively well in my life right now. I think this is the way my mind has always been but that I just didn’t realise it. This delusion can last because those who know you, care about you too much to tell you, and those who don’t know you, don’t care enough to tell you.

I know this is very self-indulgent, but I’m wondering if anyone can relate?

This post is about astrology (vedic one) and how it ruined me and how I know it's true but at the same time it all could be just confirmation bias.
 
So 3 years ago, I shifted schools and the guy from my new school was a proficient in this field and I threw in my info and then he predicted every single thing right about me. He even said I have 41 moles in my body and pinpointed exact locations, predicted how many times I suffered from jaundice and at what age and also accurately predicted that my father died at age 41 due to cancer( that's is too true). He had no intention to do background check on me and even if he did, he couldn't come up with such information about me.

Then next thing, I became motivated enough to learn the whole thing on my own and for next two years, I somewhat mastered the craft. From that day on wards, I have done more than 10,000 charts in detail ( friend, family, online celebrities (their birth certificate data is collected on astro.com site)) and made pretty accurate results that I nearly earned a thousand bucks just doing friends family and other people. 

Then the realization hit me that my chart was already pretty bad and I could never be what I want in my life. I did a tally on serial killers to serial killers, actors to actors, writers to writers and I could see a pattern emerging with 90 95 percent accuracy like some conspiracy nutjob.

Now I am depressed and wonder how any of this could be true. I mean how can I be so biased on confirmation? It's making me anxious and has ruined my daily life. I have completely given up on everything because I did my whole fucking chart already and still do it over and over again to be disappointed. I don't know what is true and what is false and I don't have enough energy to get out of this bias and I don't have enough energy to just move the fuck on. What do I do now? Help.

Because here in Florida,only a few types of Jobs exist-

-Sales and marketing

-Anything having to do with Hospitality/tourism(For obvious reasons)

-Call centers/customer service

-And...if you want to get a job here,you need to know spanish and/or have years of experience.

Why people think Florida is some kind of low cost utopia,I don't fucking know,but that's another story for another time.

I'm trying to get out of here and go back to New York...or go to Japan to be an English teacher/ALT,but that I have no damned idea because of goddamned North Korea(long story,but let's just say it involves trump.)

So,it feels like Florida is where:

A-job seekers go to die

B-you have to do something drastic(Join the military/work for the government/be a cop/EMT,etc.) to get out of

C-Or you have to wait for your parents to pass away,and then collect the life insurance money,and THEN be on your way.

Because,I feel like there's not a lot of ways to get a job in Florida otherwise,especially if you fucking hate it here and want to leave.

I feel like the world is going to end before I get a damned job here!

However, considering the amount of time you spend trying to look at my screens when we hang out, I wouldn't be surprised if you have learned my username and are looking at my posts to glean new information about me. If my suspicions are unfounded, then this message will go unread. But if otherwise.....

&amp;#x200B;

I think that you and I go through this annoying cycle:

Step 1: You try your hardest to be around me every hour of the day.

Step 2: I get extremely annoyed, and try to avoid you.

Step 3: I feel bad because it is immature to ignore people, so I show some pity and talk to you.

Step 4: You take my pity as a sign that you have a chance at winning my heart. GOTO step 1.

&amp;#x200B;

How many times do I have to reject you until you to get the hint? Frankly it's insulting, the mentality of ""oh, she doesn't know what she wants"", ""she'll come around if I just flirt with her enough"". I know exactly what I want, and you don't fit the criteria, appearance-wise or personality-wise. 

&amp;#x200B;

At first it was kind of funny, because you're predictable as hell, yet you somehow think you're being sneaky about the ways that you try to insert yourself into my life. Or maybe you realize exactly how inserting yourself into my life creates a chain of results that makes me miserable, but you don't care. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, you know that I have a huge crush on my project partner N, and that we only have class together on one day of the week, and that I'd want to talk to him alone because the two of us are quite introverted. However, by sitting in that one class (a 3 hour class that you're not even registered for!!), you managed to introduce N to all of my platonically male friends. I assume your hope was that N would become integrated into our group so that you can monitor how he and I interact, so you can find an excuse to join us in the future, or to ensure that N and I can't have 1-1 conversations in that class anymore, or to make N think that I have a posse of dudes surrounding me. It's also annoying when you do this to my friends. I remember situations where a friend was going to tell me something, but couldn't because according to him ""(insert your name here) is condescending"" and you just wouldn't leave us alone. I wonder how many social interactions I've missed out on because you hang around me. I've avoided parties because I know that it will be a night consisting primarily of you following me around as usual. 

&amp;#x200B;

The most uncomfortable thing is that you attempt to physically flirt with me by getting in my personal space. Yesterday I was sitting with my body angled away from you, and you actually moved your body so that it was angled towards me, to the point where if I faced forwards, our legs would be overlapping. Please stop this. To reiterate, I have already rejected you twice. Maybe the third time is the charm. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realize that these problems in my life stem from being too passive and non-confrontational. But also it's because we have a ton of mutual friends, thus any confrontation could potentially make my life even worse. Luckily this will only go on fr another semester.

57,"Get ready, big story coming up: 

I'm a Brazilian (21M), and live with my mom and dad. I grew up seeing her and my father fighting constantly. And I´ve always had a complicated relationship with my father. He fights with me constantly like he's my older brother trying to bullying me. He educated me being hard on me and hitting on me. He is always repetitive on what he's saying and feels like that everything we tell him, he doesn't care, it's really hard to change his mind. All he cared about me is when I'm going to finishing college.

Even my uncle when he visit us, says how exhausting it is sometimes to stay next to my father and have a conversation with him because he is very close minded and repetitive.

Besides that I´ve always been very observed and ""protected"" by my parents. I believe that this is related to me not developing many friendships. Nowadays I´m at college studying law. I have 2 close friends that I play games with, and in college I made 2 more friend (one of them I already knew from High School but ever talked much). 

Now, the thing is, these 2 new friends from college, they smoke weed and do some other drugs (LSD, Cocaine: I already did Cocaine, and I'm gonna do LSD first time this friday). I started to smoke and used to just smoke with them, to chill and have a good time, that's it. Always hidding it from my parents, they simply cannot know about it, as they would freak out, think I'm a junkie and kick me out of the house.

My mother is a very hard working lawyer but has a historic of depression in the family and she used to take antidepressants and alprazolam (just for when she had panic attacks). Before I started smoking weed I was already developing anxiety, and she would give me 0.5mg alprazolam in extreme cases. The problem is that I think I have a tendency to be addicted. 

So I started going to the same psychiatrist that she goes to, not to try and solve my problems but to get an alprazolam prescription. And the psychiatrist gave it to me. I started abusing it with alcohol, blacking out in my own room, etc. Never had withdrawls, used to do it only on the weekends.

30 pills of 0.5mg that should last more than a month were gone in 2 weeks. I started developing tolerance, and decided to stop paying the psychiatrist consultation and just buying it off the web. I could buy 3 boxes of 2mg with 30 pills each, get it delivered at home. Cheaper than going to the psychiatrist and getting a prescription.  

Now recently I bought 3 boxes of 2mg Clonazepam and I was taking them (still am) but my mother started suspecting that something was off. My parents are TOTALLY against drugs as I said before. (My father used to fight with my mom because she was treating her anxiety with Paxil).

 Well, she found my stash and freaked out, had a conversation with me, asked me what was wrong and why was I taking these drugs, said they would affect my long term memory if I kept taking them and that she wanted me to stop it immediately and start taking Paxil to treat my anxiety. 

But for me, I believe that Paxil (Paroxetina) is as bad as taking benzos. I don't want to take it. She said she couldn't trust me anymore, etc, etc.

I see it in a different way, the way that I grew up seeing my parents fighting and the way my father treats me. I already talked about my relationship with my father with my psychiatrist and he recognizes it is a difficult relationship. And it's not just with me, my mother get very stressed with him as well.

I don't know exactly why I'm putting this out here on Reddit and if this is the correct sub, but I guess I want to see your opinions about all about this and ask me questions. 

I guess I just want peace, and at the moment I'm looking for it in the wrong place (benzos).

58,"Okay so I never really thought about it when I was younger, but now that I’m older (30) I’ve started to realize that name means a lot. It’s your identity! It’s a deciding factor in how people judge you.

I was born Jacob Zollner, and I really don’t like the way it sounds. I don’t know if I’ve got a psychological complex about it, but to me it sounds too average and plain. I’ve read and been told that “Zollner” is an old German Jewish name that meant “toll taker”, but in modern times they have used the name “Zoll” for the Federal Customs Agency in Germany, and I really don’t like being associated with German Feds. 

Then the “-ner” is a suffix for an occupation, which lumps me in with so many other people, and to me it makes the name sound derogatory, like they’re calling you a “thing”. Just think of the most famous ‘ners these days like Jared Kushner. People put a derogatory tone on the ‘ner part. Hugh Hefner is a good example too. I think he understood that when people called him Hef-NER, it didn’t sound good, which is why he just went by “Hef”.

So for those reasons I’ve been thinking of changing my name to Jacob Zol. “Zol” is still the root of my last name and in the old Jewish language Yiddish it means “should”. Like Hefner with his nickname Hef, I’d like to go by the name Zol pronounced “zahl”. My family and everyone I worked with and went to school with knows me as Jake, but I’m kinda thinkin about turning a new leaf with going back to school and maybe moving somewhere new, as I could just start introducing myself as Zol.

Like I said it’s a deciding factor in how people immediately judge you, and I think in life there is great value in having a unique or cool name.

Anyone else ever change their name or feel like changing it? Ever wish you had a cool nickname like many others? It’s just something I’ve been thinking about since I had a dream of being called “Zol”.

How To Turn Six Dollars Into Six Thousand Dollars: I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. A little while back I was browsing

through newsgroups just like you are now and came across an article similar to this that

said you could make thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial investment of

$6.00! So I thought ""Yeah right this must be a scam"" but like most of us I was curious

so I kept reading. Anyway it said that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and

address stated in the article. You then place your own name and address in the bottom of

the list at #6 and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are thousands) No

catch that was it. So after thinking it over and talking to a few people first I thought

about trying it. I figured: ""what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00 right?""

Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!?... within 7 days I started getting

money in the mail! I was shocked! I figured it would end soon but the money just kept

coming in. In my first week I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had

made a total of over $1000.00! In the third week I had over $10000.00 and it's still

growing. This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of just over $42000.00 and

it's still coming in rapidly. It's certainly worth $6.00 and 6 stamps I have spent more

than that on the lottery!! Let me tell you how this works and most importantly WHY it

works... Also make sure you print a copy of this article NOW so you can get the

information off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly

that you will start making more money than you thought possible by doing something so

easy!

Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (print it out or download it.) Follow the

simple directions and watch the money come in!

It's easy. It's legal. And your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage)

IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and it is 99% no risk -

it really works!

If all of the following instructions are adhered to you will receive extraordinary dividends.

PLEASE NOTE:

Please follow these directions EXACTLY and $50000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60

days. This program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the

participants. Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the instructions.

You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business your product is not

solid and tangible it's a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many

large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However the money made

from the mailing lists is secondary to the income which is made from people like you and

me asking to be included in that list.

Here are the 4 easy steps to success:

STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper

""PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST."" Now get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE

inside

EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent

thievery). Next place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should

now have 6 sealed envelopes each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase your

name and address and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS

ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for

it! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it

all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed

that it is indeed legal. Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses:

\#1) J McClintock

80 Lenard LN

Northglenn, CO 80233

\#2) R McRae

3125 Sebring Dr.

Plano, TX 75023

\#3) S. Lambert

P.O. Box 860

Attalla, AL 35954

\#4) Joseph Martinez

1309 Commonwealth Ave Apt 5

Boston, MA 02134

\#5) Brianna Lawson

2170 Benton Blvd Apt 11309

Savannah, GA 31407

\#6) M. Watson

14374 Borego Rd apt 914

Victorville CA, 92392

STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above move the other names up

(6 becomes 5 5 becomes 4 etc...) and add YOUR Name as number 6 on the list.

STEP 3: Change anything you need to but try to keep this article as close to original as

possible. Now post your amended article to at least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are

close to 24000 groups) All you need is 200 but remember the more you post the more

money you make! You won't get very much unless you post like crazy.

This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 &amp; 1341 of the

Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and whenever you need

money you can use it again and again.

PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the honesty and

integrity of the participants and by their carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this

way. If you are of integrity the program will continue and the money that so many others

have received will come your way.

NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you either on a computer

or hard copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are truly

providing a service. (Also it might be a good idea to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to

reduce the risk of mail theft.)

So as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed six members will be

reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar each. Your name will

move up the list geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 position you will

be receiving thousands of dollars in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for

each of the first six people listed above) Send it now add your own name to the list and

you're in business!

use as long as the postman will deliver it. \*\*JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE

CORRECT.\*\*

Now each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings

each with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5 that is

another $25.00 for me now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4

and only 5 replies each I will bring in an additional $125.00! Now those 125 persons turn

around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 replies each I

will make an additional $625.00! OK now here is the fun part each of those 625 persons

post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies

that just made me $3125.00!!! Those 3125 persons will all deliver this message to 200

newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react I will

receive $1562500! With an original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name

is no longer on the list you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups and send out

another $6.00 to names on the list putting your name at number 6 again. And start

posting again. The thing to remember is: do you realize that thousands of people all over

the world are joining the internet and reading these articles everyday? JUST LIKE YOU are

now!! So can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... People have said

""what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money? So what! What are the

chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest

people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a

try? Estimates are at 20000 to 50000 new users every day with thousands of those

joining the actual internet. Remember play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really work! Youll Be Glad You Made The Effort !

I used to invest hours into these friendships, but I’ve come to the conclusion I’d rather not. It just generally ends up being more than it’s worth. Not sure if it’s because I’ve gotten older, I’m 23. In real life I only have one friend, I don’t have the need for more. I don’t like small talk. I just don’t want too many people in my life.

Here are my two cents:

* First off stress is relative. Anxiety levels differ from person to person and I think people just hold importance to the objectives of our current society. But what I have seen is that in the influx of COMFORT has afflicted many people.

In what I want to call 'THE HUMAN MYTHOS' there are three aspects to what makes us human. Arguments can be made but it is the culmination of us and persistent in our lives.

1) (Rationality/Physicality)

2) Emotionality

3) Spirituality

All families base their ""standard"" of living to at least one of these features.

The questions that follow: where did you come from? who do you choose to be? Can you understand those around you that follow the other?

But if we allow comfort into society, then where is the discipline to pull ourselves out?

""...Failure is not the falling down but the staying down"" - \[ don't remember who said that\]

We are submitted into the promise of success at the top of the mountain, but some climb aimlessly, some look down, some fear the great fall. Some choose a different object to climb, some get distracted by the products of the previous generation. ᴛʜᴇ ᴘʀᴏʙʟᴇᴍ ɪs ᴛʜᴀᴛ ᴡᴇ ʜᴀᴠᴇ ʙᴇᴇɴ ᴄᴏᴅᴅʟᴇᴅ ᴛᴏ ʙᴇ ᴄᴏᴍғᴏʀᴛᴀʙʟᴇ ᴄʜɪʟᴅʀᴇɴ ᴛʜᴀᴛ ᴡᴇ ʜᴀᴠᴇ ʟᴇᴛ ɢᴏ ᴏғ ʀᴀᴛɪᴏɴᴀʟᴇ ᴀɴᴅ ᴄᴏɴᴛɪɴᴜᴇᴅ ᴏᴜʀ ᴇғғᴏʀᴛs ᴛᴏ ᴀᴄᴄᴏᴍᴍᴏᴅᴀᴛᴇ ᴏᴜʀ ɢʀᴏᴡɪɴɢ ᴡᴀɴᴛs. The even scarier concept is that the top of that mountain grows higher.

I know mental health is important, and everyone needs to understand is that this generation has been losing hope in the wake of the sins of the previous generations. 'Hope is the spark emotion that ignites the flame of will and passion that drives the conscious machine'.

I used to be a pretty sensitive person, I never saw the point in lying or being hurtful to others. As you can probably tell, that never got me respect from my peers. A combination of my own experiences, news stories, crime rates, and the current political disputes to be had everywhere, I lost hope for the human race. After I graduated high school, I decided not to care anymore. I saw being numb as to be the only way to survive. When I see humanity, I see mask-wearing and self serving beings empty of empathy. Too many times have I seen people take all for themselves, without a shred of regret. I now prepare for worst case scenario, never letting it out of my mind. What little emotions I felt for others only feels hollow and incomplete now.

I am numb to the rest of the world around me, most of my emotions no longer feel real.

I had a rough childhood and my worst fear was always being alone. Growing up terrified resulted in me being obsessed with independence, like if I could completely take care of myself I would never be hurt by others or by ending up alone, just in case I did, but I always believed I would one day have real love in my life. In my teens and twenties I was an extremely social person and rarely spent any time by myself. Then I got into a long term emotionally abusive relationship with a narcissist, and had 3 kids with him. When I was 33 I left him, with nothing, and no child support. Now I’m almost 40, I have my own successful business doing what I am good at and love (no other staff), I have my own home (with mortgage, of course), I have amazing credit, insurance, the whole bit, and I am able to take good care of myself and my kids.

The thing is I am now alone, and I think I’ve lost hope of ever not being alone again. I have been single for the last 6 years since I broke up with my kids’ dad, my parents retired and moved 2500km away 4 years ago (my last close family in the area), my friends are in touch on Facebook, but months and years go by between visits. I have been momming and working so hard that I’ve slowly isolated myself, but when I do see people I feel like a downer, and like they feel sorry for me, so I visit less and less. I even deactivated Facebook over a month ago, because it makes me feel like a ghost.

About a year ago my ex and I started sharing the kids 50/50 and I thought it would be really liberating for me. It’s been great for my business, but when the kids are at his house, I wake up alone, I work alone, I come home to an empty home (except kitty!), I shop alone, do all the chores and home improvement alone, watch Netflix alone, go to bed alone. I don’t want to eat at restaurants or go out alone, because it just makes me notice how alone I am and how everyone else there has someone to share it with. 

I cope by hiding from the world in my shed, smoking tons of weed and cigarettes, staring into my rectangle. I know that it is preventing me from going out and living a real life, but it also soothes the ache of how heavy everything is. I have to keep holding everything up by myself for the kids, for all my clients. In the last few months, especially with the holidays, I’ve started sometimes drinking alone too. I’ve tried 3 therapists and they are so expensive and it didn’t work because I can’t open up to them. I can’t admit my lame addictions to real people. My best friend is one of the only people who knows.

I’ve gone on tons of dates, and I just don’t have it in me anymore to meet more men it isn’t going to work out with, I’ve run out of hope. Also, I just feel ugly and old and overweight, and any decent man at this age could easily find someone much prettier and not so damaged. 

I know the problem isn’t the people I know, it’s me. I have been lucky to know so many really great people, as well as a lot of other types, who’ve hurt me. I used to love being around people, but I’ve grown bitter and cold. I need to want to be around them again. I’ve become so independent that I literally have no one. 

I have had my best friend since shortly after I broke up with my ex, we met through a mutual friend and we really clicked, and hang out at least once a week. For a while she lived a block away and we would hang out almost every day. Through it all we have been there for each other, even as I lost more and more others in my life. It has finally come to the point where even she doesn’t want to hang out with me anymore and I feel like I’m spiralling, she was the last adult I see on a regular basis outside of work. 

I’m scared of my kids seeing me depresssed. I don’t smoke around them, but I do head to the shed when they’re in bed. I try so hard to stay strong and happy when they are around, and it’s easier because the 3 of them have so much going on there isn’t time for my own troubles anyways, and I’m missing half their lives now, so I want to catch up. 

I can’t open up to anyone. 

Today I woke up so depressed I couldn’t even go to work and immediately just came to my shed. For the last many hours I have been alternately crying, smoking, looking at memes, reading suicide post replies for a way to keep going, and ignoring texts and calls from my clients. I am posting here, maybe hoping to figure out how to actually tell a real person in my life that I need help, because I have no idea how to make myself that vulnerable, or who exactly to tell. I feel so weak and it hurts to have the people I  respect see me that way too, and they already haven’t been in touch, it just seems so sad and desperate to reach out all weepy out of the blue, I don’t want to burden anyone with that, and I’m so ashamed, but if something doesn’t happen soon I’m just going to crack and move to a deserted island or...I don’t know, ruin everything, ruin my business, fail my kids, end up in a looney bin, I don’t know. I know I can’t kill myself because I could never hurt my kids and family, and I know how much it would, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t cross my mind. 

I know for sure that only I can help myself, and that is the hardest part. No one can fix this pain but me and I don’t know how. I have tried everything I can think of to make friends, keep friends, date, reach out to old friends, after all these years being single it always just comes back around to me, alone. I don’t even like myself, I’m so sick of myself, I get it why no one else wants to be around me. 

Ok, well, not sure if that really helped me or not but it’s way long so I’m going to shut up now. If you read this, thanks.

88,"Hello everyone,


First of all: I (24M) am writing this post together with my girlfriend (22F, “J.”). She is fact-checking everything and approves of the things you’re about to read. You don’t have to worry about me exploiting her abuse: **this post is a team-effort as she wanted to share her/our story in the first place.** J. is not interested in creating a Reddit account herself, therefore we are using mine. Information that may be relevant is that we met when we were both kids: I was 8, she was 6. We’ve been BFF’s ever since and only started dating a few months ago. 


This is going to be a lengthy post (our apologies) but we’ll provide a **tl;dr in the bottom** and try summarizing the necessary details. For those with more time to read, here’s her story:


My girlfriend was abused as a child by her step-father, so was her sister (20). It didn’t go as far as PIV sex, but his hands were in/on places they should not have been. He also forced her to perform sexual acts on him (oral, handjobs) and at a certain point he demanded she masturbated in front of him on several occasions while he sometimes jerked off. Her mother was oblivious to the fact her daughter was being abused as she had/has alcohol problems for years. When J. was 12, she accidentally let their “secret” slip to a teacher, who informed the authorities and she ended up in foster care. Luckily, she had a relatively normal childhood and teenage years, also thanks to loads and loads of therapy.


At the age of 16, J. had her first boyfriend. A guy from her school who was a few years older than her. Their relationship stared off pretty good and she felt comfortable around him. He gave her lots of compliments which she liked a lot. She always says she was an ugly duckling until the magic of puberty hit her at the age of 16 (again; her words, not mine) and being told you’re pretty and hot is always nice. Their relationship started to mature and after a few months of dating, they mutually decided to take it a step further and try sex. 


What you should know it that J. has had a lot of therapy up until this point and felt good enough in her own skin to take this step. Unfortunately for her, this guy wasn’t the sweet and caring guy he made people believe. He became more and more violent and in the end had sex with her numerous times without her consent. According to her, he raped her seven times on seven different occasions. Some of them started as a consenting act, but he saw that as an invitation to just do whatever he wanted, without asking her specific consent for certain things (anal sex, for example). Apart from the sexual abuse, he was also emotionally abusing her, making her believe no one would ever love her and she should be glad there’s someone who wants to “fuck an ugly sow” like her. After about a year, the found the courage to dump him.


When J. was 18, she met a 21 year old guy. She was friends with his brother and knew the family for years. He was a nice guy. I knew him too, actually. He went to my school and I talked to him a few time. Cool dude, not bad looking, played soccer and was relatively popular, but he didn’t seem to care about that. They started dating and I saw the two of them together a few times and they genuinely seemed happy. She opened up to him about her past: about her abusive father and her first boyfriend abusing her too. He told her they would just take it slow and only take it a step further is she was ready for it.


That turned out to be a big fat lie, as seven months later (about a year into their relationship), he was so fed up about “still” not haven’t done anything sexual besides some kissing, he raped her after getting her drunk at a party. After yet another guy in her life sexually abused her, she fell into a deep depression. I knew her for almost 12 years now and I never seen her so dark I didn’t know of any of the abusive boyfriends. I knew about her parents, not the other cases of abuse. She didn’t care anymore what was happening to her, she just let him have his way with her. It still is a bit painful for her to talk about it, but whenever they went out together, they slept as his place and he just used her. In her words:


“We didn’t have sex, he had. He used me as a bucket to cum in. No matter what I said or tried, I always ended up in pain, broken and questioning myself.”



About 1,5 years into their relationship (so months of abuse) J. and I met during the summer while he was on a holiday. I was dating someone else, at that point for almost 4 years. My then-girlfriend and J. had become close friends. We were hanging out at my then-girlfriend’s place when I got some pizza’s at our local pizza place. When I came back, J. had opened up to my then-girlfriend about all the abuse and was in tears. I asked them what was wrong and with the help of my then-girlfriend, J. found the courage to tell her story once more. She dumped his ass over the phone, filed a police report and she hasn’t seen him since.


Fast forward to September 2018. My girlfriend I talked about in the paragraph above has sadly passed away in January 2017. J. went to therapy and up until this moment, she still has sessions every other week. Her and I decided to start dating, the story behind this decision is for another time, but we like to go into a little more detail about our sex live, which I guess is what you came for (pun somewhat intended).


Soon after we started dating the two of us had a long conversation. I knew all about the abuse and I wanted to make clear to her that I really didn’t care about sex. I just wanted to be with her, care for her, y’know, the whole boyfriend thing, minus the sex part. Seeing both of our schools would start soon and we would live in different cities, we just hang out every single day for three weeks. During these three weeks our bond only grew and she felt more and more comfortable about me being physically close to her. She initiated hugs and wanted to cuddle more often. Our kisses went form short kisses on the lips to minute long make-out sessions. And at one point, *she* decided to take the next step. She was the one in charge now. 


What started as a cuddling session on the couch, became the first time she had sex and actually in years enjoyed it (her words, not praising myself). Whilst she was getting undressed and unbuckling my pants, I kept asking her if she was sure about it. I believe that after the seventh time, the got annoyed and asked me to shut up. Neither of us know, but we both believe it’s just years and years of built up sexual tension between the two of us that came together and got released all at once.


The first few times we had sex afterwards, I let her initiate it. I didn’t want to hit a nerve or seem like I pushed her. After a while, I carefully tried initiating it too. This was often not well received by her, as she panicked when things started to get heated. We still don’t have sex spontaneously when I initiate things. Usually, when I am aroused and would want to have sex, I blatantly ask her if she’s in the mood for sex. You’d think this would kill the mood, but it actually helps *a lot*. It makes it clear to me if I get the green light of going further or not. In case it’s a no, no harm done. I don’t push her, I just don’t bother trying to “get” her in the mood. It’s also way better for her. She can just tell me if she’s not in the mood, which has strengthened her self-esteem as she is building the courage to say “no” and whenever she does wants to go further, she always says “yes” while giggling. 


I think the most important thing we’ve learned it communication. We are both very open about the things we like and the things we don’t. Despite her dark past, she has no problem being in a more “passive” role with me being more dominant (usually when I initiate) or giving oral (always initiated by her). I think we both can only grow from here and try to discover more things we like. We talk a lot about sex and we often try new things, with varying degrees of success. Sometimes we discover something we both like a lot, other times it’s just something one of us (or neither) likes.  



**tl;dr:** my girlfriend was abused by her stepfather until the age of 12 and had two abusive boyfriends (at the age of 16 and 18 respectively), who used and abused her for months, both sexually and emotionally. After being BFFs for years, we decided to start dating. We’ve learned to be very open towards each other when it comes to sex and also communicate during. She has discovered a lot about her sex life and the things she enjoys.


Thanks everyone for reading, even when you just read the tl;dr. Y’all are great!



Love,


J. and N.

89,"Decided to practise in the living room tonight where my amps are instead of going direct to my PC. I forgot how incredible this amp sounds, plus I just changed the strings and set up my Warwick Thumb - pure auditory nirvana. 

I'm sitting in front of the patio doors, watching the heavy snow fall down with the hazy city-lit skyline in the background - it's very peaceful

I've got a date tomorrow night after work, hope the snow isn't going to mess it up but I'll happily take the hike if that comes to it.

I'm cautiously optimistic, but maybe I should just throw caution to the wind, I need to stop being so guarded and self-conscious.",31Jan2019,1
90,"Pretty much everything I've done in my life, I've wanted to do it in the hopes of being perfect. Playing sports, schoolwork, competitive video games, etc. No matter how athletic I am, how well I do in school, or how high of a rank I am in video games it's never enough and it makes me completely hate myself. This shit is a part of my life completely now, for example I'm not ugly, have a good physique, overall just an average guy but I hate myself because I'm not a 10/10 model. Holy fuck I can't believe it just hit me and I figured it out... but now I don't know what to do because for one reason or another I've conditioned myself for dozens of years to hate myself if I'm not perfect ",31Jan2019,1
91,"There's a building in my town that I used to go to a lot late at night to wander around in and be alone, but recently somebody finally either caught wind to what I was doing, or coincidentally decided to start keeping it locked at night.

92,"I go to a secondary school when I could have gone to grammar school (grammar schools are for more academically minded people). I had to look after my brother with autism and he couldn't get into a grammar even though I did well enough to get into whatever school I wanted. Everyone sees me as the ""smart one"" or ""the weird kid's sister"", I feel like that's what my identity has been reduced to and I can't get close to anyone new because of it.

I came out as a lesbian about a year ago. There was heckling and the odd push and shove but I got through okay. But every time I bring up girls or even make a joke, I get looked at like I've got two heads and my some of my *friends* called it gross. I'm the only openly queer person that I know so, although I try my best not to, sometimes I let the opinions of other people get too far inside my head and I end up hating myself again.

Anyone could guess that the lesbian nerd doesn't have a whole lot of friends but I suppose I do in a way. I sit on my own at lunch but a group of people seem to think that means I was saving the surrounding seats for them. I actually like having them around, they're pretty funny sometimes too, but I can't say a word without being ignored, so it feels even more isolating than if I were left to sit on my own. 

Everyone dreads the days leading up the vaccinations, myself included but not for the same reason as them. Every time I get a note about any injections my mum goes on a tangent about how they caused my brother to be autistic, I have to blackmail my own mother just to me protected from the fucking mumps, I have to argue on my brothers behalf although he tells me not to, he believes every word she tells him so he hates vaccines too. 

After these arguments my mother tell my dad that I'm a ""risk"". So even when I'm invited out I'm usually not allowed to go.

 I was born into my sorry excuse for a life. I'm clean from cutting but sometimes I feel like picking up the knife again. 

I'm sure I'm not the only one, there are people just like me. There are people out there who have it worse and probably cope better than I do. 

But it always feels like my whole life is just distorted and wrong. It's my fault too, even when I'm alone with no one else to blame for my problems I end up wasting time trying to escape by reading novels, exersing or playing video games rather than actually trying to fix my social life (I worry that any attempts to improve my social life will just backfire). It's a vicious, lonely cycle and sometimes I wish I could just get out.

94,"This happened last Tuesday, our mutual friend entered the classroom and told us that he is number one in his class, like he has the highest gpa in his class, and then other people joined our chat and we started taking I don’t remember about what tbh but when the class started we all went to our table, my friend asked me what number in my class I was I said, jokingly 245 (out of 290 or something). Around 20 minutes later our mutual came to our table and we started taking, my friend was writing and essay and our mutual friend gave him some advice which I thought I was wrong and made a face showing that I disagreed, kinda like this emoji 🤨 and then she (my friend) said “don’t listen to him he is a loser, he is only 245th in our class.” It may sound like a joke but she was serious. She thought I was being serious when I said I was 245. And I started to think that she thinks that I’m stupid. I’m not as good as a student as they are but I’m not bad, I’m been above average this past week. I also remembered that a few months ago we were taking about college and I said I wanted to go to university of Michigan and she said “no, you are going to utepl (our local university which doesn’t have a lot of prestige)Both of them, our mutual friend and her are kinda condescending to me and that’s all, I wanted to get that off my chest. What are your thoughts.",31Jan2019,1
