3,"Hey Reddit, I’m a 21 year old girl, and I’d like to start this story to just about a year ago. I’m a cashier in a local grocery store, and am using this to pay my way through college, where part of my degree is in English. This is important. Last year, an old man who I’d known only as a customer came in and gave me a knitted lion hat. I thought this was odd, especially since it looked like it was made for a child, but I soon forgot about it. 

You see, this customer was eccentric. He always came in and talked about English with me, since he knew my major. I was in a Shakespeare class last year and he kept ranting on how Shakespeare wasn’t actually Shakespeare, he was a man named Edward de Vere, a point which he still pushes on me today. The next semester, I had a Poetry class, and this is where I really started to see the weird side of this customer, who, from here on, I will refer to as “Tom”. 

He told me he was a poet, among other things. He also told me that he would be working on a book soon. This is important.
I didn’t think too much of this for a while. In the Summer, however, he gave me a piece of paper with a letter that Edward de Vere has written on it. The problem was, Tom didn’t know French, and I did. He asked me to translate the letter for money. I said sure, but was confused as to how Tom knew that I knew French. I wrote it off, however, that maybe I had mentioned it more than once.
I translated it, thinking that would be the end of Tom’s odd behavior. It was decidedly not.

In September, Tom told me that he was really planning on putting together his book of poetry. He said that I was perfectly in his target demographic, and he would like people to review his poetry for him. He said that he would bring in the first batch the next week for me. He did not let me respond. He also said that he would be bringing in his own soda that he makes himself for me to try, as he had noticed that I drink coke. I thought this was quite odd, but not necessarily harming anything yet. 

The next week, he began bringing in his poetry for me to review. These are all Shakespearean sonnets in an Early Modern English style. The first thing I noticed about his poetry was that it wasn’t that good. The second thing I noticed was that at least some of his poetry was about me. Mind you, he told me that most of his poetry was 15 years old, but I’m not stupid, and I can tell when someone is talking about me. This is where I started getting disturbed, but he gave me $25 for reviewing five poems each week and times are tough, I’m in college and could use the gas money. 

I wrote him a note with my review telling him that I agreed to do it, but there was a lot he should fix. His poetry was very niche, etc, I didn’t think it would sell. I ignored the first poem being about me because I figured it would be the only one, as thanks for helping him out. I was wrong.

As the weeks have gone on, the poetry has piled up because I’m busy. The more it goes on, the more I feel as if every poem is about me, and I’m getting quite uncomfortable about it. He mentions specific things, like a lisp, that the woman in his poetry has. He mentions her being small. He mentions her being distant. He also mentions school days, and her being young. These are all traits that fit me in some way. 

He started to bring in a different soda every week, along with strange baked goods. I’ve tried the soda, but I haven’t tried anything Tom has baked me. My friends have tried them and said they aren’t very good, however. 

He also asks for me to teach him one word in French every week, and this I do because I want him to leave. For Christmas, he got me a present- a French Encyclopedia.

In general, he creeps me out, and I’ve tried to avoid him but he knows my work schedule. Once I tried to leave my post for 20 minutes while he was in the store so that I could avoid him, but when I returned, he was still in store. I asked a coworker about him, and she said that he had stood at my register for five minutes waiting for me.

I feel as if it’s gone too far to cut it off now, it’s week 14 of poetry and he is paying me every week I bring in the reviews. I also need to pay for the new semester of classes. I also feel like I can’t refuse a customer. What should I do? Is he technically not stalking me because he’s paying me? Should I just stick with it even though I’m uncomfortable, because it’s nearly done?

TL;DR- I’m 21 F, know French and am working towards English degree, work at grocery store. Old man comes in, forces me to translate stuff for him and review his bad poetry. He gives me soda, baked goods, and money in return. I only agreed to help after this began. Quickly realized he was obsessed with me and most of the poetry was about me, am uncomfortable about it but idk what to do because he’s giving me money?

P.S. This is my first time posting on reddit- not sure of the rules so sorry if this is in the wrong thread or if I wrote too much, sorry!",21Jan2019,1
5,"Just felt like letting this off my shoulders somewhere productive. I am 19(M), and this is my first year at university. While the work itself is very easy, whats troubling me is my realization how much I actually need to socialize (or rather, that I haven't done it in ages). My ex and I broke up about a week ago. It was a serious relationship which lasted about 2.5 years. Initially I was quite sad and scared since a) my first relationship b) she fell in love with another guy (or whatever it is). She was unhappy with me, but she had a lot of serious issues in her life which she was unable to deal with, and it greatly weighed me down, so it was mutually agreed that we're not in a good place for it right now.

Now, I feel relieved and honestly relaxed for the first time in forever. Surprised to say that I am over the whole thing already, but now the loneliness kicked in. These past 2.5 years I didn't make an effort to make any new friends (I have a couple of good old ones, but they don't live near me), since my ex was really the only person I bothered talking to. Now that I am alone, I have no friends to go out with or do anything fun really. I thought I was ok without a proper social life, but oh boy was I wrong. I have a bunch of hobbies that I do seriously, primarily Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, which I am relatively new to but I train a lot and it makes me happy. 

I checked a bunch of clubs out at Uni but only a couple stood out and entrance cost some money, not too much, and I got little to spare right now. I am not \*anxious\* about socializing as per say, but it feels weird, like, where do I start? I think making a couple of buddies that I can hang out with quite often will be my goal in the foreseeable future, but I just feel weird about the whole thing. 

Maybe I am over her and the relationship, but I really let it consume my whole life, and I feel like I am left with nothing. I know that this is normal and I am not so much whining about it as I am just realizing how a relationship should add onto your life, not be the only thing in it, otherwise this happens.

Plus ex moved in with the guy she's with now, but its in my building... and on the same floor, although she has to leave the country in a month or so. A good friend of mine found out through a mutual friend that she was going around telling people that we weren't together anymore before we officially broke up, which kind of made me angry, but simultaneously good because I had a solid reason to leave her. There's a cute girl I was thinking of getting to know who lives here, but might be awkward now all things considered (I'll man up and ask her after some conversation either way).

Just a really weird time in my life that made me realize mistakes have been made. I was wondering does anyone here have any suggestions how to go about this whole business of socializing after not doing so in god knows how long? Should I wait until ex leaves before I start chatting to girls again or bad idea?",21Jan2019,1

The person who retweeted this is the same person who, when given advice on how to stop her dog from having accidents indoors, told her husband that I said they were bad pet owners raising their dogs wrong and yelled at her.

The person who retweeted this is the same person who, when told I would not be taking responsibility if their dogs doing damage to the apartment cost us our security deposit, told her husband that I said that I wouldn't help fix up the apartment's issues, clean, and repaint scuffs on walls, and expected them to do all of it.

The person who retweeted this is the same person who, when I told them I wasn't sure they'd like a video game because it's more mechanically complex than another video game they had a hard time playing, took that as a deep personal attack and still tells people about how awful it was of me to say such a thing.

The person who retweeted this is the same person who vaguebooked every single day of her life and now apparently does the same thing on twitter, because if she goes into detail on anything, the absolute undeniable objective fact that she is a huge cunt would come to light.

The person who retweeted this is the same person who, when a mutual friend stood up to her for mistreating them, proceeded to make it all about her, tell everyone that she was a victim of abuse, gaslight out the ass about every single thing in her life, continue to abuse, and participate in a smear campaign against her including calling her abusive and threatening their friendship if she didn't do as she asked only to turn around and insist she never did that within 5 texts, all while pretending on facebook and twitter that she was being left behind by a dear friend without any reason given and didn't understand what was happening.

The person who retweeted this is the same person who, when planning events, literally intentionally left me out of them and, when prompted by the girl from the last thing with the idea of inviting me, ignored her. 

The person who reteweeted this is the same person who, when asked if I was being left out on purpose, was part of the pair who said yes, absolutely, because you don't fill an arbitrary planning-stuff quota so we're going to stop planning stuff with you until you do it for us enough to earn it. 

I cannot **fucking believe** people like this exist. Either braindead beyond reason, or evil to the point of literally deserving of the title ""monster"". To do these behaviors and then try to convince others on social media that you're a victim to them? How can someone do that?! How can someone do that and not recognize what absolute bile is pouring from their mouth and fingertips?! What compels a person to become this much *garbage?!*

I told the friend to stop showing these things to me as it's been 10 or so months since [shit went down](https://old.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9ea78t/i_stood_up_for_myself_to_my_friends_and_they/) and its not really healthy to keep thinking about it, but it's honestly hard to look away, it's absolutely fascinating to look at, and almost thrilling to get so angry about how much of a piece of shit someone can possibly be.

How do their friends and family not recognize that they are a horrendous monster? How does nobody get this woman checked into a mental health clinic for narcissism and sociopathy?

How can someone literally sharing things to make themselves come across as a victim while convincing others that the people they were abusive narcissist bitches to share ""people have to pretend you're a bad person so they don't feel guilty about the bad things they've done to you"" and not implode in on themselves like a robot asked to divide by zero!?",21Jan2019,1
7,"i don't really know where to put this, but i wanted to tell someone who doesn't know me. i want to open with- i'm not suicidal. i have no intentions of killing myself. i am fairly self destructive, i'm seriously depressed, and possible bipolar but probably not. i do things that are not good for me. i drink to excess, i don't mind experimenting with drugs. i don't mind combining them. it's almost always in a very safe environment with people who know what theyre doing and would not let me get out of hand in a dangerous way. private occasions. i'm not talking about parties or clubs or anything like that.

i do not cut myself, i don't participate in any serious physical abuse.

two nights ago though something was different. i'd taken some diazepam, maybe 20 or 30mg. and i could feel my mood really declining. things haven't been ""hard"" lately, but i've just been in a low place. I was drinking some wine at the same time, i knew this would have an interaction, but it's nothing i was unfamiliar with, and i was confident i was safe.

then my mood kind of just kept getting lower. and i think i took some more diazepam, and then i poured myself a tall glass of 100 proof vodka on the rocks. i knew this was a potentially really really bad idea. but i didn't really care. it's not that i was looking to maybe not wake up, i just wanted even that night to be over. i wanted to sleep it off, really sleep it off. but i knew what i was about to do was a bad idea. so i left a small note on my nightstand. i won't say exactly what it said, but it said that if ""this happened"" it was an accident, and i never intended to kill myself. it outlined how to handle some of my more valuable digital assets, who should be allowed to go through my things first, and that it wasn't ""her"" fault.

it took me a long time to wake up that next morning, and i knew i had blacked out, probably just for a half an hour or so, but long enough that i thought i left myself half a glass of wine on my nightstand as some hair of the dog. i took a real good swig of strong vodka, and got a nice little surprise.

i saw the note i left, and realized how stupid and childish i had been the night before. i'm not a paranoid person, nobody is going through my stuff or anything, but looking at that note, i knew it could literally never exist. so i took another big swig of vodka, ripped up the note, and ate it.

it's ok to feel bad. it's ok to indulge from time to time in a safe way. it's ok to feel a little better when you do. if i had a magic answer to feeling bad that i was about to share, i wouldn't feel like shit right now.

i've got people who love and care about me, and they know i love and care about them too, sometimes you just can't  help yourself though. i just can't believe how foolish i am, and how foolish i will probably continue to be, and it's going to hurt a lot more people than me. i guess i wish i could be a better person to myself, and in turn, others.",21Jan2019,1

It creates a lot of issues because higher sex drives = more competition = more people who are offended by your high sex drive ganging up to block you from getting relief.  Because it seems they are miserable about their lower sex drives, so use the extra time to build walls against people with higher sex drives to prevent them from picking from their garden's, so to speak (their daughters and SOs).

13," 

So on Friday, my friend invited me to drink some whiskey, I'm not a drinker so it was kinda my first time drinking a lot.

So I've drunk so much I started vomiting, then my friends mom called an ambulance, then a paramedic came it was a girl, we went outside, the paramedic was hugging me really hard it felt so fucking good to be hugged really hard by someone, I've never ever been hugged before, I'm a very lonely person so it felt so good. while I was at the ambulance going to a hospital I told her how much I hate myself, that I don't see the point of my existence, that I feel that everyone hates me, that I don't see why my friends are my friends. she told me that I shouldn't underestimate myself, after that she said she'll find me, I don't even remember how she looks like, I only remember her voice. As I think about her I get sad and happy at the same time, honestly, it was one of the best moment of my life, someone hugging me it was unreal.

​

So moving on to the next part of the story, the hospital nothing much happened there, didn't sleep then at 11 am psychiatrist came, she asked me some things, I told her that I use anti-depressants and they thought that I was trying to kill myself that night.

​

A few hours later, an ambulance came to pick me up, we drove for about 30minutes to the mental hospital, went to their psychiatrist she asked me how i feel etc told her everything, then she asked me if it was a suicide attempt, i was like no, if i was about to kill myself i would drink all of my anti-depressants and laughed, it was probably wasn't funny to her but the way i see it, it was funny for me. After that i went to their changing rooms, they gave me full-white jeans, jacket, etc, they counted every single thing i had and wrote it on paper, after 10-15 minutes they gave me my phone so i could call someone, i called my brother to come get me out of there, then i went to the 4th sector of the hospital, an old lady talked to me, she asked me what's wrong, why im here, i told her that i don't see the point of my life, that i hate myself, how much i just want to die, she kept telling me that i'm only 18 and i shouldn't be depressed, that there's so much motivation for me, that i shouldn't feel the way i feel,that i have friends, Like wtf honestly she made me feel worse, I don't know why I'm not happy i don't even what to do to feel good about myself and my life. After that I went to my ward there was 1 guy who was also depressed, he told me how bad this hospital is, that no one gives a shit about them, as soon as I talked to that lady i knew it was a bad hospital, the doors had no handles, everything was so white it was pretty scary. Then my brother came, he asked to call the manager, my brother, and their manager came to their office, and i went to my ward, after about an hour they called me to come, i had to sign papers that I'm refusing to be at that hospital, and my brother signed different shit he's taking the responsibility of me, that if I kill myself it'll be his fault. they said that I really need help.

​

I don't know what else to say, besides that I'm doing alright now i guess.

I'm seeing psychologist and psychiatrist and i hope that my life will come to a great path.

27,This might sound pretty pathetic but I just need to get stuff off of my chest. I just started my second year of university. currently rocking a GPA of 1.5 which isn't exactly pretty. Last semester was the very first semester I actually made irl friends but even they are starting to drift away which kinda blows really. I still don't have a job mainly because my parents want me to focus on uni without getting distracted by a job but it looks like it didn't exactly matter. I don't wanna make any excuses for what happened it was entirely my fault but I just wish it didn't go like that. before last semester I had a GPA of 2.65 and I was determined to raise that. I started working really hard at the start of last semester but eventually I just gave up. ended up with 2 f's. I did everything I wanted last semester. I got shit grades but hey at least I should be happy right? wrong. in fact I had many breakdowns and experienced an anxiety attack for the first time. I spent the entirety of the last semester hanging out with my irl friends and talking to my best friend online. I tried to be happy towards the end I knew everything was going to shit anyway. boy was I wrong. one day during winter break I was frustrated and tried to overdose. ended up in the hospital for a day or so. when my parents took me home they basically took away all my electronics and locked me up in my room for a couple of days. I got my laptop back at the start of the semester. I couldn't talk to my irl friends at all but I did try talking to my best friend using my brothers' phones when everyone was asleep. shitty but I just wanted to let her know I was fine. that made things much worse when I got my laptop back and talked to her. she thought I hated her and was avoiding her and now she basically hates me. I'm trying to make things better but it doesn't look too good. I really don't wanna lose my best friend of four years but that is very likely. I tried talking to my rl friend and he completely avoids me now. nowadays I spend all my time playing league of legends and not going to classes.

28,"So I’ll try to make a long story short here. But I’m nearly 22, in college, and live at college about an hour from my parents house. I work most weekends to pay my bills and get by I have too. So for the last year or so I haven’t been able to go home very much. I also got off to a super rough start last semester of school after dealing with some personal issues and was determined to make this semester better.  

My younger sister, who’s 6 years younger than me, was diagnosed with a rare neurodegenerative disease not too long after I graduated high school almost four years ago. She has steadily declined and in the last few months gotten much worse. I live in a small town back home, and most people I know from home know about my sister and her condition. But most people I know in college, friends, people from work, professors, have no idea, I don’t tell people because I didn’t like how everyone acted so sorry for me when I was living back home.

Now after talking with my family the past few days, it seems that it’s only a matter of time before my younger sister is gone. She’s been bedridden for sometime, now on oxygen and it sounds like the family is simply waiting. But I’m scared, and totally unsure about what to do.

My dad has been off from work for almost two years or more caring for her. My mom works not 10 minutes from the house and is usually home by 4. I’m going home tomorrow to see and talk to them but I have school, and work and all these commitments an hour away, which makes it kind of hard to go home and play a sit-and-wait game. This whole thing with her being sick has really messed me up the past few years. I don’t want to, I mean I don’t think I can, shirk on my responsibilities to go home and wait for her to die. I know that this time is the most important for families to be together but I just don’t know how to handle it. I’ve never dealt with anyone this close to me dying, and I just feel stuck and confused and worried.

I don't really know how to describe the feeling itself in words, but I'll try to wrap it back around in the end the best I can.

When I was in middle school, I had problems with my mentally abusive, sexist, perverted father. This led to one of my friends getting authorities involved, but dumb kiddo me shut everything down really quickly. To be fair, i still don't like the way things like this are handled. I was never close to my father at all and he has always treated me like an object, or at least a person not capable of very much aside from cooking, cleaning, and having a body. 

Around this time, I was discovering my own taste in music just as any pre-teen does. I began to obsess over one niche band that I'd found out about on the internet. The band is very friendly with their fans. I was a dedicated and devoted fan on the internet for a while before going to a few concerts. I eventually began talking to a few band members over social media. They didn't have a huge following at the time, and little things like fan art that I made or certain posts I would write about them made us closer. I was about 13 when we really got close, because their cult-like following was growing and there had even been some nonsensical internet drama. At this point I'd been sitting through all the public hate they got with them. It was also at this point that passionate haters would send me death and rape threats. (But of course, it is the internet after all.) It was just over little things, but the band members who I talked to at the time would calm me down and talk me through it. These adults, over twice my age, really became my ideal vision of parents in place of what my father never gave me. Over the years, I did tell them about my living situation. These were people who had seen both my parents before (when I attended concerts) and understood what I was telling them. It felt good to have adults on my side. I have truly idolized them.

I think what happened was that as the fan base grew and I became closer to these few people, as I was becoming more of a friend and less of a fan, the lines got blurred between their stage personas and their real selves for me. I'd always had online personas, so I'd like to say that line became smudged for myself too. It has now been over 5 years since I first started talking to them, and I still think about their band status every time I talk to them, and yet I see them as my main support circle. I'm planning to move out to their town ASAP, and maybe these things will fade as I realize who I truly am, and maybe they won't. Sometimes I get feelings that I'm supposed to act a certain way to the fan base and to them, and I can't just be myself because of the status that this band has. I also now have a status for being a known part of the fan base for so long. I can't stop thinking about that either. They really count on me moving away from my dad, even if my parents won't let me attend the college I was accepted to there (I will still be 17 by the start of the semester, so my parents have to sign a lot of stuff for me). One of them has been wanting me to look at apartments down there, only because he knows it's where I want to be and I would feel better there. It really tells me that he's a friend, and yet I still don't even feel comfortable calling him by his first name, and can't talk to him without fear of bothering him.

I made this anonymous account to look for housing in that area, actually, so I really do hope that no one who knows my situation sees this before I get around to it. I don't really know what my issue is. I find it harder and harder to converse or make decisions when people become my friends, because I view my future with those band friends and my future communities as a whole half of my life. I don't know what I can and can't talk about. Alternatively, I don't know how to talk or act around people I don't know, part of the fan base or not. I'm sorry if all the talk of this band situation in any way seems show-offy, but the band isn't very mainstream anyways, and I'd rather not reveal any specifics. Thank you for allowing me to at least put this somewhere so that anyone who has experienced something similar can relate. ",21Jan2019,1

45,"I'm worried that my friends have lied to me.

One of my friends had a crush on me just as we got to know each other well, he is very well liked, popular, rich, attractive... everyone liked him. All of my straight female friends were attracted to him, and I knew that. I was too, and despite the fact that we talked everyday and had much in common, I doubted that he would ever be attracted to me in that sense. I knew he was a good person, but I contradicted myself in thinking that he was probably the type to only like girls for sex. However, I did feel that it would be good if him and another one of my friends dated. They would be good together and they had expressed their interest in him since the day I met them. This became a source of stress for me.

I had recently gotten out of a really emotionally abusive friendship and had reconnected with some friends from my pre-teen years. I was well aware of how people had changed, but I gave it a chance because I have changed too. I met new people and got to know them well.... I met some of my best friends mere months ago. I disguised my guilt in liking my friend by trying to set him up with my other friends. I felt terrible because he was the first person I had ever really liked. I'm not a superficial person, but I felt I was because of the materialistic wealth and superficial attractiveness my friend possesses despite his good personality.

My plan to set them up was intercepted when one of my friends met her current boyfriend. I was happy for her... until we began to drift apart. By this time she knew I liked my friend and she began to insist that it wasn't meant to be. That I would be happier with someone else. I've never been too invested in dating, but I really like this guy... she should have known that. Her excuse was that he smokes, which I already knew. Her boyfriend then to told mutual friends to try and keep the friend I was interested in away from me and vice versa.

It made me uncomfortable feeling like everything I did was wrong. Every conversation I had with my guy friend after this was cut short-- I would get nervous and leave. We got really close one time... I liked it, as did he. He was smiling and stepped even closer and then I looked over because, well, privacy I guess and I saw one of my friends looking at me with this upset look. I excused myself hastily and walked over to talk to her. I still don't know why it bothered her.

Later, she and 2 of my other friends as well as her boyfriend began to insist that I was ""delusional"" and that there was nothing between us. No friendship, no attraction, even going so far as to say that my friend now ""hated me with passion."" Strangely, none of them had anything to back up their claims and my friend continued to talk to me against mutual friends urging. He still does, although it is impeded with his increased drinking and smoking habits. He does sometimes act annoyed with me for no reason, but still initiates friendly/borderline flirtatious conversation.

The main concern here is how much some of my friends have talked behind my back. They have cited my ""innocence"" as a reason why I should stay away from him, although he is far from promiscuous. I refuse to stop talking to any of them, but I wish I knew why they seem opposed to every choice I make. I'm very logical and have not acted excessively irrational or erratic, so their concern seems misplaced and has added to a bit of growing mistrust in them.

47,"Are there really 150 million Muslims who wish death on all non Muslims?

If there were in fact 150 million Muslims wanting this as claimed, I imagine they would have already won and be in control of the entire world. 

To put this number into perspective before we go any further, 1 million seconds is about 11.5 days, while 150 million seconds is 4.7 years. There is a massive amount of difference between a million and 150 million. 

Now consider the fact that there are 1.3 million people on active duty in the US military (3rd in the world by the number of standing members), if you include reservists that number increases to 2.1 million. Since the entirety of the US military is larger than the next 20 something countries *combined*, I don't see any reason for those 150 million Muslims who literally want to slaughter every non-Muslim man, woman, and child on the planet, and who also believe that dying in battle while trying to achieve that goal is the greatest thing a Muslim can do, and those that do will be rewarded with the highest honors in the afterlife, to not just steamroll over the world with sheer numbers...because they absolutely could. 

So the greatest military in the history of mankind has a little over 23 days worth of fighting force (keeping with the seconds analogy), meanwhile the imaginary enemy you're creating can fight for almost 5 years, wants nothing more than to fight, would be highly rewarded in the afterlife for fighting, but for some reason isn't fighting? At least not with a force of 150 million. 

Do you think it's possible that the assessment of 150 million radical extremists might be just a little off base?

I don't know where this 10% figure came from but I've been hearing it for years. I suspect that someone somewhere created it using ""simple math"" and ran with it, and it's been repeated without confirming it, without finding out how that number was reached or if it's an accurate representation of reality, and without thinking about the real world implications of what it would actually mean if it were true (basically what fake news organizations do) ever since. It fits what people wanted to believe, so they believed it. 
 
If I sampled 10 Muslims, and 1 of them was a wacko, my sample would show that 10% of Muslims are wacko. But would that be an accurate representation of reality? Are they wacko because they're Muslim? Or are they just a member of that subset of the population that's wacko, and they happen to be Muslim? Were they raised by a wacko [that wasn't in my sample], and they simply don't know any better due to isolation? Even if the wacko was wacko because they were Muslim, does that justify holding the 9 other Muslims accountable, or judging the basis and practice of their entire religion for the actions of the wacko? 

If I sampled the entire Muslim population currently in the United States, and then sampled the entire Muslim population currently in Iran, and then sampled the entire Muslim population on the entire planet, the results of those samples would likely be so vastly different when compared to each other that they may as well have been from 3 different groups. 

If you look at religions, extremist groups, and cults as a whole, you'll find that Islamic terrorist organizations operate more like cults than they do like religions, especially with their recruitment styles. They focus on the weak and easily manipulated, give them whatever it is that their life is lacking, and then make them believe that what they're doing pleases the leader/s and/or Allah. And they do it because for the first time in their miserable life they feel welcome, powerful, and appreciated. We are not ""at war"" with radical Muslim extremists, we're battling well organized cults being led by fanatics who hide behind and weaponize Islamic culture and faith in order to advance their personal goals and agenda, not their religious goals and agenda. Even if their personal goals are religious goals, they're still personal not religious. 

It's ""Simple math""^^TM 

No, it's really not that simple, as I hopefully just showed. Math is rarely that simple, that's why most people hate it, and some people spend their entire lives studying it (and still never fully understand it). In fact, the only people who try to claim it's simple are generally the ones who are trying to trick someone who doesn't understand it into doing something they shouldn't do, or trying to make something say what they want it to say, instead of what it actually says, and they don't want anyone to look too closely. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, you're guilty of the second one if you believe the 150 million number. 

&gt;The numbers really fucking scare me! 

There is nothing wrong with being scared, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. Literally everyone gets scared, even your heroes. What defines a person is how they react in the face of fear. The weak flee as soon as possible the instant fear makes an appearance, not because they're weak, but because they're smart enough to know that they're weak and that nothing is more important than survival...especially the ego. The weak-minded go on the offensive the instant they get scared, because they're only capable of knowing what they know. And what they know is that they will fight to the death anything that threatens them, because to them, survival isn't as important as not going down without a fight...the ego will kill you if you let it. So they prepare to fight as soon as they get scared, and preemptively strike/ambush anything that scares them whenever possible, with an ego driven scorched earth backup plan firmly in place should they ever fail. The strong are able to control their fear verses allowing their fear to control them in order to do what's necessary. They weather the storm in spite of their fear and only take action when necessary, and then only take that action which is absolutely necessary to achieve their goal or accomplish their mission...forgoing the ego boost obtained via overkill. The ones who can effectively utilize knowledge, wisdom, harnessed fury, and especially restraint in the face of immeasurable fear, generally come to be known as heroes, or martyrs, or traitors...depending on who tells the tale. 

I will never try to invalidate another person's fear, and I'm not saying that you shouldn't be scared. Through a sheer feat of coincidence that I'll never understand, I pulled out of Jacksonville, FL on-board the USS John F Kennedy for a 6 week training cruise a few short hours before a few planes flew into a few buildings and changed the world forever. There were more than 5,000 other people on that ship with me when we got underway that morning, and every single one of us knew that we were all deploying to the middle east together for [at least] 6 months a few months after we got back, and we knew that as the attack was taking place and as the blame was being assigned. We spent the 6 weeks following the attack trapped in a steel box on the ocean watching everything unfold on the news, and every last one of us, from the most junior 17 year old kid to saltiest and most senior sailor on the boat, was absolutely and undeniably scared. Scared of what could happen to our families. Scared of what could happen to our country. Scared of the future. Scared of a hundred different things and nothing all at the same time. But mostly we were scared of the unknown. That's the hardest one to overcome. There are tears running down my face as I type this due to the emotions caused by reliving this last paragraph, which took me more than an hour to compose, so I'm the last guy who can talk shit about someone else's fear.

56,"  

... based on my near-death experience.

Few years ago I was home alone, eating strawberry chewy jellies (kind of like a thick marshmallow consistency). I accidentally swallowed one without chewing it well enough and it got stuck in my throat. I'm not entirely sure how long I couldn’t breathe for, but it was definitely more than 3 minutes. That might sound trivial to some but choking to death is a very fast process (research I found says for a normal person it takes about 6 minutes without oxygen to die.).

I choked for what felt like an eternity, I was too paralyzed to do anything rational so I just sat in my chair and struggled, trying to cough and spit the chunk of food out, but I couldn't take even the smallest breath. It got to the point where I lost my vision, there was just darkness in front of my eyes. 

It’s worth noting that year prior to this I fainted during my veterinary practice (too much gore) so I already knew how losing consciousness feels like. I realized that it's coming. I was alone, I was my only help, so I knew that if I faint it will be the end of me.

“This is it, I’m dying” was all I could think about when I felt I’m fading away into the dreamy, blurry state. And then suddenly... the panic stopped. Suddenly I felt the happiest that I ever felt in my life. It was simply “indescribable” but I will try to explain...

I felt an overwhelming love and compassion coming from all around as if from many different sources and directions. Safety, calmness, ecstatic joy overcame me. It felt like the whole Universe embraced me in the warmest of hugs. It was a pure mother-like, unconditional love I never felt before.

I guess my mind went blank for a moment cause the next thing I remember was gasping for air, I don’t remember if I managed to spit the chunk of food out or swallowed it, I‘m unsure how it happened but I was alive. At first I was breathing chaotically almost as if I had to learn how to do it again, but eventually, I found a normal breathing rhythm. 

The scientific explanation of what I felt would be that in a state of such immense panic my brain released happiness hormones for some reason... to deal with dying better? Who knows... 

Of course, there is also a spiritual explanation, that what I felt was God’s/Gods love as he/she/they decided to spare my life. I don’t follow any religion so I’m not familiar if that what connection with a higher power should feel like. 

Sometimes I manage to feel something similar again (but never as intense) through meditation. It makes me uncontrollably cry of happiness each time.

Whether it was God’s love or neurotransmitters going bonkers in a state of panic… it was an amazing feeling either way and it’s good to know people don’t leave this world with pain and fear, but with joy and love.",21Jan2019,1

59,"It’s not really a spectrum, but let’s use this analogy for now as it’s simple enough for the sake of clarity.

Most people cluster and fit very nicely near the ends of their respective side of the gender spectrum. Their genitals and identity are almost always aligned, and they derive a great amount of enjoyment in trying to be the best man or woman they can be (something Gillette cleverly realised way back when but seem to have forgotten now). It gives them something to strive for, and those on the other end of the spectrum validate them for it.

And let’s not pretend that gender doesn’t serve a role, it clearly does. Women are specialised for child birth and rearing, and men are specialised for challenging physical work and for protecting, all generally speaking. This has been the case historically, our biology and social structures reflect this. Collectives work better when the subgroups are specialised. It’s not fucking rocket science. It’s a tried and tested path to efficiently that evolution has hit on time and time again.

Okay - it’s not as important now as it has been in the past - but don’t think for a second that we don’t have drives and desires deeply built into us that reflect this structure. And we all know what happens when we deny and repress desires. We get sick, and the desires express themselves in destructive ways.

Why are we so willing to kowtow to a tiny handful of weak and ill defined individuals and potentially blow apart a structure that is so fundamental to our psychological and physical well being?

65,"I am asking this question sincerely. And though you may think the answer is obvious and anyone who cannot instinctively know it is very stupid and/or inhuman, I insist the question is more difficult than it seems.

You see, a key part of what I am getting at is why this specifically is the advice given time and time again. There are thousands of things that we could have and did not do with our loved ones. But the plea is always to tell them they are loved. Why is that what people regret not doing? It is not satisfying to simply say that it is because love is more important than other matters; the demonstration of love is not limited to stating the words ""I love you"". In fact, those words if alone demonstrate nothing but a lie; love is in fact found in behaviour, in things like looking after people and generally being nice. This is what really matters. So if you loved someone, presumably you would have shown it through your behaviour and if you had told them you loved them that little statement would have offered nothing the behaviour could not. And if somehow you loved them but were cold or nasty, then surely the real mistake was not failing to state the words ""I love you"" but failing to show love through day-to-day interaction and that would mean the advice ought to be to **show** love daily, not to **tell** it once or twice, at the hospital bedside or what have you. Yet the advice given is more often to tell than show.

Am I wrongly taking the bereft to be very rational? Is it that in their loss they know they are no longer able to interact with their loved one and so feel a need to implore others who still have the opportunity to do **something**? The phrase ""I love you"" contains so succinctly and purely their feelings, much more purely and obviously than general kind behaviour spread over years, which, if examined in its tiny parts, such as cooking a meal or purchasing a gift, may fail to be recognised for love. Is this why it shines bright as the right thing to them?

Do the bereft believe that had they used words to declare their love their pain would now be less? Why would it? The dead would be equally dead. Their loss would be equally huge.

I have asked /r/NoStupidQuestions. I thought I may be ridiculed or even scorned for asking. They were sympathetic but I still feel unsatisfied; I don't understand.

67,"Hi Reddit !

I'm currently working in the UK as a French Language Assistant. I love my job, love my colleagues, love the country, but I'm not feeling well at all at the minute. 

Being away from my friends and family was something I managed to deal with pretty well at first but then I went back home over the Christmas period and I realised how much I loved them all.

I live with five other people in a shared house and even though I like them I feel really anxious whenever I need to use the common area which means that I barely see them and that I'll stay in my room for hours and hours and I feel trapped.

But that's not all. I've just learnt that my ex (we were each other's first love) had a new boyfriend and it's just depressing. It's so weird knowing that she'll be happy with someone else and that this guy is lucky enough to be with her. She is trully amazing and I wish I was that guy right now.

I need to be with my friends and my family just so I can breathe a little. Right now I feel alone and it's really unpleasant.

As I said earlier, I love my job and my colleagues are brilliant and I love them as well, and I don't want to quit. But just a week or two at home would be nice. The only problem is that it's not really an option so I'll just have to cope with my issues and negative thoughts at work.

- a 12 part series where I walk you through how I perceive people as, if they are gemstones. Putting together anecdotes and facts that have passed on for generations, some heard and some unheard of, I hypothesize the nature of individuals around us. 
I would like to share how this concept came across. If not all of us well some of us at-least place our interest in the horoscopes, all the fancy stuff like the stars, their positioning associating yourselves with different star-signs might just help one get a feeling of being a part of something bigger than themselves. One time I overheard someone having a conversation about birthstones and it really piqued my interest. 
Apparently birthstones have been spoken about in many cultures over centuries and it is believed to beneficiary for health, wealth along with other factors that matter to an individual. Fascinated by this, I did some further digging into it and what I had come across was just enchanting. Hence I decided to portray it with a touch creativity.

I started a job at a customer service call center taking inbound calls. These calls deal with people's mortgage loans so it can be emotional for the customers, and the ""stakes"" are the highest I've ever had for a job.

 I deal with most people's biggest investment in their lives and whenever I give them wrong information or mess up a process I feel really guilty and dwell on it days after. This isn't something exclusive to the job, but my position has amplified this feeling. 

On top of that, my social anxiety makes it a challenge to talk to these people and then even the decent interactions give me obsessive thoughts, thinking about what went wrong. I was having difficult sleeping and I was having anxiety attacks every morning. 

Finally went to the doctor and got on a medication. I can only hope it makes my job a little more bearable.

Lately my SO and I have been having a tough time, we haven’t been getting along and it felt like we were at our breaking point. There’s been a lot of arguing, distance, and not really understanding how to satisfy one another. 

Two nights ago, we ate shrooms for the first time. At first it consisted of us just laughing with our friend at YouTube videos and making a bunch of weird noises. Eventually I sat on one side of the room alone and they were on the couch. He kept looking at me and telling me although I’m sitting alone and doing my own thing, I am so important. He kept telling me I was beautiful, how he loves me so much and how he’s really glad that I’m here. For a solid two hours him, our friend and I were telling each other how important we all were and how we’re so loved. 

It seemed as if we all were experiencing pretty much the same thought processes, feelings and visuals. For a few hours it was almost as if our mental health issues were completely gone and we were able to talk about how we truly feel with zero repercussions. I was telling our friend how I loved him and how great he was and there wasn’t any jealousy from SO. The whole time the one word that kept coming to my mind on how to sum up my feelings and experience was “raw”. Everybody was saying their true, undisguised feelings towards each other with zero worries about what the others would think and it was nothing but positive. There was no judgement, it was comforting. I have never felt so wanted and loved. 

Later in the night my boyfriend and I went into our room, he had plans to go to bed but we were still tripping pretty hard and ended up sitting up talking for four more hours. We talked about mental health, work, stressors, how we are as people and ways we can improve our person and relationship. I told him the things he hasn’t been giving me that I am very much longing for, which was basically just affection. I have told him this sober but I don’t think he truly understood how important it was to me until we went into depth about it. He has a much better understanding on how that’s so important to me and how all I need is to feel loved. I can do everything else. I can cook, clean, shop, work, etc and all I ask of him is to touch me and make me feel wanted. For a temporary amount of time we put all of our mental health issues aside, all of the things we were stressed about, and focused on how to be better. Like I said before, it was a very raw experience. 

Ever since my boyfriend has made a very noticeable effort to give me what I have been needing for so long. I feel like we’re closer, we understand each other a little bit more. He understands what I want and I understand why it’s been so hard for him to give it to me. This didn’t solve all of our issues and instantly make everything okay, but it definitely put us both into perspective and I believe it’s uphill from here. All in all, the night was extremely cathartic and something I really needed. If we get to that point again, it’s time to eat some more shrooms. ",21Jan2019,1

No (1 point) 

He called himself a socialist. His last years were spent fighting economic inequality, which is significantly worse now than it was in 1968, though the racial component remains. His allies today would include Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [1][2]

2. Do you support Black Lives Matter?

Yes. (5 points)
I sympathize, but disagree with blocking traffic etc. (3 points)
No, there's too much vandalism and violence in those protests (1 point)

His methods of peaceful protest are echoed by today's Black Lives Matter protests. Using nonviolent resistance, both movements sought to disrupt city life, blocking traffic, interfering with business, inconveniencing everyone within range. Back then, as today, opponents seized on any instances of violence or vandalism to discredit the entire movement. [2]

3. Did you support Occupy Wall Street?

Yes (5 points)
I sympathize, but they didn't have any goals, and the occupations put public safety at risk. (3 points)
No (1 point)

Before he was murdered, he proposed a massive tent encampment in Washington DC to protest economic inequality. After his death, the camp was built and lasted six weeks before the police shut it down by force, citing public safety. In 2008, history repeated itself as encampments sprung up in New York and other cities in the form of Occupy Wall Street, and were again shut down by police citing public safety. Same cause, same method, different decade. [2]

4. Do you support Antifa?

I don't agree with their methods, but I understand where they're coming from. (5 points)
No, by engaging in violence they're just as bad as the white supremacists they fight. (3 points)
No, they're the real nazis. (1 point)

Dr. King saw the militant black power movements as misguided, but hesitated to publicly denounce them. He considered Black Power as a reaction to pain and the anguish of oppression. Antifa can likewise be seen, by a pacifist like Dr. King, as a desperate cry against forces of authoritarianism taking hold in our country. I can only imagine that without condoning, he would understand. [3]

I went out with my friends and where drinking before going to a club. It was a park, there were lot of people there, just a normal weekend on a Saturday night in Spain. After one hour drinking beer I had to go piss and so did I. I told my friends I'd leave a minute to piss and looked for a hidden place behind a tree. I saw a dude there, thought he was pissing too but the thing is that when I started, he got closer and asked me to piss on him. He knelt down and opened his mouth looking at me. It creeped me out and I just couldn't keep on pissing xD. The situation was just too much and I didn't want to get in trouble so I just came back to my friends like nothing. 

So that's the story of the piss assault! You can't know how people will keep on surprising you I guess xD. How would you have reacted? I was alert when he started walking towards me but after that I just didn't know what to do. I still don't why someone would do that, not a good thing to molest someone in that situation...

I got out of the shower, and was in my room, getting dressed, tossing my towel to the floor. I usually don't put on socks first, but my mother kept drilling into me to wear the ""high socks"" because it's ""frigidly cold today"". So I put on those crew socks first.

Then, oh my God, I realized it. The key to my studies that has been bugging me for the past week. I had to make notes right away.

So, clad in nothing but my glasses and socks, I rushed to the computer and typed up my thoughts.

As I typed away, the door flung open. I gasped and stood up immediately.

It was my mother's best friend Mrs. Jenson. In her early 40's, married and beautiful.

""OH MY GOD! I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE BATHROOM!""

In my terror, I realized the sight in front of her. I'm standing there buck naked.

Well, not ""buck naked"". Maybe even worse. Standing there in just glasses and those white high crew socks. You know the ones? The red white and blue rings at the top? Hands at my sides in shock. Tanned from the neck up, lily-white from the neck down. Round chubby ""studies while munching on Oreos"" belly in full view. Small package (hey it's a throwaway) dangling for all to see.

She yelled ""Socks! Socks! I mean SOCKS! I MEAN SORRY MY GOD"".

Then, because I'm a fucking idiot, I turned and presented my plump, shaking white butt to her as she stifled a giggle and finally got out of the room.

97,"Recently life has become more complicated than ever for me; cause I'm now 20 and starting to think about future, life plans and you know, I'm just caring about stuff I didn't before...

Now let's get into details. I live in a society that kind of everything is almost, if not yet completely, fucked up :/ too many people  are completely poor, the rest only have some  basics to live (me among them), a little are rich and also too rich :| Apart from this; health care, education, culture and bla bla bla, are seriously not even near what these days standards are. And let's not even talk about the cause of these stuff, The Government, they just keep lying and not caring at all... ( These are just some examples, you have no idea :/ ). Simply this society needs some kind of revolution stuff :)

And now about my case. I just can't start doing my own shit and not caring about anything. I can't focus on my own life and dreams when I see that there are people out there, who can't even go after their dreams, and not that I have everything I need to do so but at least I have some basics to survive. But there are many, who just have none. So I started thinking and I came up with two solutions. One to do some Gandhi stuff and fix these all; but I just simply don't think I am that kind of person, I'm not that interested in going to  start a revolution and I even have no idea how to do it or even have the potential and tools to do it, I'm just a 20 year old crazy guy with no money... Anyway the second solution I found is: okay, I can't change everything, but I can change myself and make a difference in my own way no matter how little that is gonna be. 

But the problem is that it just feels really bad not to be able to do something big and fix everything. I just can't enjoy and have a good feeling about doing my own stuff and becoming the dream person I want, when I see some others can't do it and my society is fucked up and nothing in it's place.

If there were in fact 150 million Muslims wanting this as claimed, I imagine they would have already won and be in control of the entire world. 

To put this number into perspective before we go any further, 1 million seconds is about 11.5 days, while 150 million seconds is 4.7 years. There is a massive amount of difference between a million and 150 million. 

Now consider the fact that there are 1.3 million people on active duty in the US military (3rd in the world by the number of standing members), if you include reservists that number increases to 2.1 million. Since the entirety of the US military is larger than the next 20 something countries *combined*, I don't see any reason for those 150 million Muslims who literally want to slaughter every non-Muslim man, woman, and child on the planet, and who also believe that dying in battle while trying to achieve that goal is the greatest thing a Muslim can do, and those that do will be rewarded with the highest honors in the afterlife, to not just steamroll over the world with sheer numbers...because they absolutely could. 

So the greatest military in the history of mankind has a little over 23 days worth of fighting force (keeping with the seconds analogy), meanwhile the imaginary enemy you're creating can fight for almost 5 years, wants nothing more than to fight, would be highly rewarded in the afterlife for fighting, but for some reason isn't fighting? At least not with a force of 150 million. 

Do you think it's possible that the assessment of 150 million radical extremists might be just a little off base?

I don't know where this 10% figure came from but I've been hearing it for years. I suspect that someone somewhere created it using ""simple math"" and ran with it, and it's been repeated without confirming it, without finding out how that number was reached or if it's an accurate representation of reality, and without thinking about the real world implications of what it would actually mean if it were true (basically what fake news organizations do) ever since. It fits what people wanted to believe, so they believed it. 
 
If I sampled 10 Muslims, and 1 of them was a wacko, my sample would show that 10% of Muslims are wacko. But would that be an accurate representation of reality? Are they wacko because they're Muslim? Or are they just a member of that subset of the population that's wacko, and they happen to be Muslim? Were they raised by a wacko [that wasn't in my sample], and they simply don't know any better due to isolation? Even if the wacko was wacko because they were Muslim, does that justify holding the 9 other Muslims accountable, or judging the basis and practice of their entire religion for the actions of the wacko? 

If I sampled the entire Muslim population currently in the United States, and then sampled the entire Muslim population currently in Iran, and then sampled the entire Muslim population on the entire planet, the results of those samples would likely be so vastly different when compared to each other that they may as well have been from 3 different groups. 

If you look at religions, extremist groups, and cults as a whole, you'll find that Islamic terrorist organizations operate more like cults than they do like religions, especially with their recruitment styles. They focus on the weak and easily manipulated, give them whatever it is that their life is lacking, and then make them believe that what they're doing pleases the leader/s and/or Allah. And they do it because for the first time in their miserable life they feel welcome, powerful, and appreciated. We are not ""at war"" with radical Muslim extremists, we're battling well organized cults being led by fanatics who hide behind and weaponize Islamic culture and faith in order to advance their personal goals and agenda, not their religious goals and agenda. Even if their personal goals are religious goals, they're still personal not religious. 

&gt;It's ""Simple math""^^TM 

No, it's really not that simple, as I hopefully just showed. Math is rarely that simple, that's why most people hate it, and some people spend their entire lives studying it (and still never fully understand it). In fact, the only people who try to claim it's simple are generally the ones who are trying to trick someone who doesn't understand it into doing something they shouldn't do, or trying to make something say what they want it to say, instead of what it actually says, and they don't want anyone to look too closely. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, you're guilty of the second one if you believe the 150 million number. 

&gt;The numbers really fucking scare me! 

There is nothing wrong with being scared, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. Literally everyone gets scared, even your heroes. What defines a person is how they react in the face of fear. The weak flee as soon as possible the instant fear makes an appearance, not because they're weak, but because they're smart enough to know that they're weak and that nothing is more important than survival...especially the ego. The weak-minded go on the offensive the instant they get scared, because they're only capable of knowing what they know. And what they know is that they will fight to the death anything that threatens them, because to them, survival isn't as important as not going down without a fight...the ego will kill you if you let it. So they prepare to fight as soon as they get scared, and preemptively strike/ambush anything that scares them whenever possible, with an ego driven scorched earth backup plan firmly in place should they ever fail. The strong are able to control their fear verses allowing their fear to control them in order to do what's necessary. They weather the storm in spite of their fear and only take action when necessary, and then only take that action which is absolutely necessary to achieve their goal or accomplish their mission...forgoing the ego boost obtained via overkill. The ones who can effectively utilize knowledge, wisdom, harnessed fury, and especially restraint in the face of immeasurable fear, generally come to be known as heroes, or martyrs, or traitors...depending on who tells the tale. 

I will never try to invalidate another person's fear, and I'm not saying that you shouldn't be scared. Through a sheer feat of coincidence that I'll never understand, I pulled out of Jacksonville, FL on-board the USS John F Kennedy for a 6 week training cruise a few short hours before a few planes flew into a few buildings and changed the world forever. There were more than 5,000 other people on that ship with me when we got underway that morning, and every single one of us knew that we were all deploying to the middle east together for [at least] 6 months a few months after we got back, and we knew that as the attack was taking place and as the blame was being assigned. We spent the 6 weeks following the attack trapped in a steel box on the ocean watching everything unfold on the news, and every last one of us, from the most junior 17 year old kid to saltiest and most senior sailor on the boat, was absolutely and undeniably scared. Scared of what could happen to our families. Scared of what could happen to our country. Scared of the future. Scared of a hundred different things and nothing all at the same time. But mostly we were scared of the unknown. That's the hardest one to overcome. There are tears running down my face as I type this due to the emotions caused by reliving this last paragraph, which took me more than an hour to compose, so I'm the last guy who can talk shit about someone else's fear. 

Your fear is legitimate. Your legacy will be how you respond to it.",21Jan2019,1
100,"I have struggled with anger, resentment and hatred for almost 13 years, dealing with the death of my mom. Last October, the word ""forgiveness"" kept popping up in my life, and I realized it was the missing piece toward my own healing. Every time I heard the word I would tear up, because I knew it was something I felt I could never do.

A very long story short, my stepfather killed my mom (and himself) on March 31, 2006. It was the greatest tragedy in my life and everyone in and around my family. I have dealt with it in many different ways over the years, but I think I finally took another step forward in my healing process. 

I wrote a letter to him. Even though he will never get to read it, it's not necessarily for him. It's for me. I need to let go of these feelings of anger and resentment, and I feel like the letter helped. I'm not going to post the letter because it's for me, but I  wanted to share to the universe (reddit) that I feel better after writing to him. 

Maybe you are going through something too. Maybe something happened to you that you feel angry and confused, and just don't know how to navigate your way through. Maybe you feel like ""this is it, I'll feel like this forever"" as you course your way through life as an emotionless zombie. I just wanted to reassure you, that you are not stuck. You are not alone. Your feelings are valid. You are alive and awake, and you have been granted the beauty of feeling what life has to offer. Sometimes life sucks. Sometimes you get handed the wrong deck and you have to figure out what game you're actually playing. Just know, you are surrounded by people who love you for you, and most of all you can love YOURSELF for YOURSELF, flaws and all.

If you are going through something difficult, maybe write a letter. Thanks, friends.",21Jan2019,1

102,"im just going to get straight to the point.

i watched my step father die on august 31st 2012 after having a 2 year battle with cancer. he was in a coma, so it wasnt a painful death for him. he moved his fingers slightly whilst i was holding his hand. right after he moved them, the machines and life support started to beep and everything, nurses running into the room and pulling me away. they keep me out of the room, but i managed to get back in. as i entered the machines went from the normal ""beeping"" to the fast beeping when there is no pulse.

i was around 9 and a half years. that same day was the day i had to become a man, for my brothers.

i have 2 step brothers, both who my step father is the father. ever since ive had to teach them everything.

after my step fathers death (i will just call him father as he was for me, my father) we moved back to the uk. i had alot of therapy which helped alot until i saw a girl kill herself just a few days after my 10th birthday. i never told my mum, or my therapist, but i still see that girl jumping of a bridge. my mother turned quite abusive around half a year after his death, she beat me alot, lots of screaming and letting her pain and rage out on me. end of december 2013 we moved back to austria. my grandma had bought us a house, every since i have been here and i really hate it. ive always been ""the odd one out"" here.

the next 3 years, my mother kept beating me alot, generally being very abusive. it was around this time,  the beginning of 2016 where my youngest brother (4 at the time) started to call me daddy and told all the kids in kindergarden i was his father. i do basically everything my father did and tought me, i teach my middle brother sailing, how to use power tools or what to do when a car wont start, basically everything a good father does.

beginning of 2017 i ended up in hospital with alcohol poisoning after going to a party with people i met earlier that day. i ran away from home because of a big argument with my mum. (i just turned 14 at the time), i cant recall anything from that night but the paramedics wrote in their report that i cried about missing my stepfather, that i hate my mum and that i dont want to be alive anymore.

just a few weeks later, a good friend of mine hung herself in her bathroom at home. now this didnt effect me too much, as by this point in time i was emotionally so broken that death didnt really effect me. all this proved to me was that the world is a harsh, shitty, bad place.

its the beginning of 2019 now, between now and the beginning of 2017 i have had 2 suicide attemps. ive had countless hours of therapy with different therapists, and its just going downhill now. 

i had a moped accident 2.5 months ago, broke both hands and had to change school (i went to a sport school) i forever will be unable to use my left hand properly. ever since that accident, i have lost all hope of getting my life into control again.

last week i was standing on the edge of a bridge, sobbing, for about 2 hours. i was so close to jumping, but i dont know why i didnt.

im turning 16 now, im 6 foot 1 tall, nearly have a full beard and look around 20. my brother doesnt call me dad anymore, but i know he sees my as a father.-

i dont know what to do anymore

im lost

104,"AI is so fascinating. I hope I‘ll be able to read this in a few decades; So basically, I have the impression that many people don‘t really seem to realize it‘s gonna be a huge deal. Or maybe they don‘t quite care? It should be handled more like climate change. I don‘t know when I first found out about it, but in the past year or so it really makes me wonder what the point of getting a decent education is when it‘ll be obsolete in a few years anyway. On that note, I‘d say we‘ll feel some smaller impacts until the mid 20s. Some self driving cars, some medical assistance, but then the big unemployment will hit towards the end of the decade. 

An UBI might be rallied for in the early 30s, maybe politics take the topic seriously by then. Damn, that‘s also when people who were born in the 10s and grew up with digital technology from their birth will be adults. And my generation will become… Wait. Damn. AI generated music! Even today AI could relatively easily be convincing enough to act as a chatbot and maybe make someone fall in love with them. Will texting ever be the same (if it‘s still a thing by then)? Could you even trust who you‘re talking to unless you meet them in person, since AI could easily emulate video at some point? At least the politicians might finally be replaced in the 50s or so. We appreciate power. 

Maybe there‘ll be a civil war between the pro and anti AI humans. I might be drastically overestimating the extent of the changes AI will bring, but who would have seen the internet coming 30 years ago? It‘s honestly amazing that it was already somewhat established 20 years ago. Yet there are still people (like my mom) who don‘t think it‘s relevant in any way. The most radical technological changes in the world often seemed pretty unpredictable to the masses (before the information age, at least) even though there were warning signs. 

Trains were so mindblowing at their time. Imagine those speeds as a peasant who‘s never gone further than the next town. And then you‘d grow up to see photography, electricity, all sorts of industrialization. Or if you were born a century later, you‘d see cars replacing the horses, tank shells replacing the walls of your house, planes in the sky (isn‘t it crazy how much earlier balloons were around though?), radios and recorded music, and in your older days you‘d have computers and might even still see the advent of the internet. Now we‘re the ones in the following century. Growing up with smartphones in our youth and early adulthood, but there‘s so much more to come. There‘s a crazy amount of innovation in its infancy that‘ll await our later lives, far more than just AI.",21Jan2019,1

106,"I didn’t know anything about these things until I lived in Germany in the 1960s, and toured Dachau. It was raining the day I went for this memorable walk and my feet sunk into mud as I trudged from the barracks to the ovens to the showers. The ghosts of lost souls were all around you. You could hear, see, smell and yet there was no one there now. Displays for the public consisted of caked blood on the wall, the floor and the beating clubs. Photographs of atrocities and some of the lost souls were hanging everywhere along with the ghostly screams and unearthly silence.

My walk through this death camp was made on Good Friday which made it even more memorable to me as a Christian as something that should never have been. I will never forget witnessing the living nightmare that was then and is now a tourist attraction! Trembling from the unearthly surroundings, I left the premises, quietly and silently, feeling like an intruder on the outside looking in at unimaginable suffering.

I read about an inscription written by a young Jew, on a cellar wall in Cologne after the war and the camps: ""I believe in the sun, even when it is not shining. I believe in love, even when I feel it or not. I believe in God, even when he is silent.""

Is there a more consequential event in the twentieth century, then the Holocaust? This is not to diminish the terrible holocausts of China, Cambodia, and the USSR, but that the reorientation of a society’s industrial might to obliterate entire races, to do so efficiently, to induct so many ordinary men into complicity with it--this makes the Holocaust the nadir of modern history into which we all fear to sink.

I agree with Jack Kuper, author of *Child of the Holocaust* that children at the age of reason should be made aware of the poignancy of the past.  However, if we are to avoid such deadly things reoccurring, we must not merely be made aware of the facts; we must recognize the transcendent worth of all people.

110,"I am basically your typical college senior geek. Still living at home while commuting to college. I have been so stressed about my latest project at school.

I got out of the shower, and was in my room, getting dressed, tossing my towel to the floor. I usually don't put on socks first, but my mother kept drilling into me to wear the ""high socks"" because it's ""frigidly cold today"". So I put on those tube socks first.

Then, oh my God, I realized it. The key to my studies that has been bugging me for the past week. I had to make notes right away.

So, clad in nothing but my glasses and socks, I rushed to the computer and typed up my thoughts.

As I typed away, the door flung open. I gasped and stood up immediately.

It was my mother's best friend Mrs. Jenson. In her early 40's, married and beautiful.

""OH MY GOD! I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE BATHROOM!""

In my terror, I realized the sight in front of her. I'm standing there buck naked.

Well, not ""buck naked"". Maybe even worse. Standing there in just glasses and those white high tube socks. You know the ones? The red white and blue rings at the top? Hands at my sides in shock. Tanned from the neck up, lily-white from the neck down. Round chubby ""studies while munching on Oreos"" belly in full view. Small package (hey it's a throwaway) dangling for all to see.

She yelled ""Socks! Socks! I mean SOCKS! I MEAN SORRY MY GOD"".

Then, because I'm a fucking idiot, I turned and presented my plump, shaking white butt to her as she stifled a giggle and finally got out of the room.

Now my mother is asking me why I ""study naked as a jaybird"" ""all the time"" and I can't ever see Mrs. Jenson again without feeling exposed.

I made the mistake of telling my friend Ashley who laughed her ass off and said ""oh my God that woman will never see you again without mentally stripping you down to nothing but your adorable tube socks and probably told all her girlfriends hahaha. I might too.""

Is Ashley right? Will she probably tell her girlfriends? How detailed? Would she really always see me mentally stripped to just socks whenever she sees me? Ladies please be honest.

121,"You don’t look at me and think that I’m overweight. But I was. Not dramatically, but it was clear to me because I knew what I looked like under the baggy clothes. I knew my weight and my BMI.

I don’t think it really hit me until I stayed at my grandparents’ house last summer and saw pictures of myself from when I was younger. I was struck by how much sharper my chin was and how much more defined my jawline was. I noted how much less baby fat was in my cheeks despite the pictures being from elementary school. at least ten years ago.

It wasn’t just that, though. I strongly take after my dad’s side of the family and my genetics are shit because of that. I’m predisposed to, among a lot of other things, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Plus my grandma had multiple heart attacks. All of these conditions are exacerbated by being overweight or obese. Add that to the fact that most of the women in my dad’s side of the family are overweight or obese and you can see why I was nervous.

I had no idea where to start, so I tried to burn a certain amount of calories per day on the exercise bike. That didn’t work because, as I later found out, my main issue was snacking. (Also, it’s really hard to keep motivated when you feel like have to do something every day if you miss a day or two.)

I found an app for keeping healthy just after Thanksgiving. I created an account and entered that I wanted to lose weight at the rate of one pound per week (which was the recommended rate). I started inputting what I ate and how much and it automatically calculated how many calories I’d consumed or burnt (through step tracking). Having the numbers right there in front of me was ridiculously helpful in making me see where I needed help.

I weigh myself once per week. My starting weight was 146.4. My weight today was 137.9. I’ve lost 8.5 pounds. I can’t describe how amazing it feels to finally, for sure, be under the 140 mark. (I’ve been 140+ for at least a few years now. My highest weight was probably just about 150.)

My goal is 125-130, so I’ve still got a little ways to go. But I can’t tell anyone.

First, since I don’t and didn’t look like I needed to lose weight (but I did), and because I’m young, I’m afraid people will assume I have an eating disorder. I don’t. I’m honestly focused on health.

Second, my friends can be insecure about themselves. They shouldn’t be but they are. I’m afraid that if I tell them, it could give them the idea to lose weight or download the app I used even though none of them need it. (One in particular has struggled with an almost-eating-disorder in the past, and that’s the friend in most worried about.)

I'm a 18 year old male who works with IT support and have generally little to no places to go partying, and I'm generally incredibly awkward around people and I hate trying to talk to people over social media because I feel like such a creep.

I mean, in a sense, I just want to stop the shit-smearing on my name and try to get to know other people to cope with this or sonething, but I simply can't due to the way I am socially. Any tips?",21Jan2019,1
