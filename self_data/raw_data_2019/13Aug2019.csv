0,"Long story short, I’m 22 and she’s 19. There was an obvious maturity gap and she had a lot of problems that she was dealing with (extreme bipolar, PTSD, anxiety, and major depression). She used to pick fights during her bipolar episodes and during the last one I ended it on the spot. I then found out she was pregnant (definitely from me since we were always together and she wasn’t using BC correctly), and stayed for a bit until it ultimately didn’t work out again.

Since then I’ve been trying to better myself- I’ve quit watching porn, cleaned up my diet, started lifting, and am going on 30min-1hr runs every evening. I signed up for classes for the upcoming semester of school and am working hard at becoming better at my new job as a server in a restaurant.

All these good things are happening but I just feel like something is missing. I don’t have too many friends anymore and I don’t do anything too interesting that would make anyone want to stay friends even though I’m generally a charming and humorous guy. I feel like reaching out and getting back together with my ex but I don’t know if that’s the right move.",13Aug2019,1
1,"I am absolutely ignoring you. All of you. It took me ten years just to gear myself up enough to post or comment. I don't want to talk to anyone. I fucking hate people. I never check my DMS and I never check responses to anything I say. I can't and I legit don't care. I woudn't be doing any of this if it was not required by law or my therapist. I didn't leave my room for over 10 years. Social services intervened. They and my court appointed Doc need to see proof that I'm trying to interact. Otherwise I will be committed for life. To a federally run and funded mental institution. Which is it's own shitstorm. A Hell hole.

5," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",13Aug2019,2
6,"I feel so sad never being in a relationship before and I am 24. I've never had a boyfriend or been on a date before. I feel like every woman has had some dating or relationship experience at this age but I have absolutely none. Men never approach me and I am barely hit on or shown interest either. I don't think I am ugly (at least with makeup on, but without makeup I know I don't look my best) and people say I have a good body but men just don't notice me. I have never had a guy ask for my number or leave his number for me. It doesn't help that when I go on social media, I literally start crying because all I see are relationship posts and I am still single. I would rather meet someone irl but I have tried an app before. Usually the guy will compliment me and then later the conversation fizzles out or he stops talking to me later.

They are nice people, but as a group they always exclude me and never respond when I say something in the group chat but will instantly respond when someone else responds. Throughout the summer, they hung out with each other but never bothered to invite me or see what I was up to. I even tried to ask them to do things and they would either say they’re busy or not respond.  It just made me feel really shitty and messed with my mental health. I’m just ready to go out and meet people that truly lift me up and that are reliable and real. I’m just kinda scared about going pretty much cold turkey again with making friends and hoping I find people who make me feel good.

10,"I dont know when it went down hill with me but I think it must be like 7th grade or so. I just looked through my old school reports. When I was little I remembered being the total nerd. Terrified of missing some homework. Doing everything I could to succeed. You can see it in these reports actually. Only As and Bs. That was nice. Then I switched school and still everything was okay. I had my first C in 4th grade but it was just the next grade and not that big of a deal. It went further to more Cs and no As. Next my first D and soon after my first Es (is E a thing??? we have 6 numbers for grading but E sounds wrong) please note the plural. It all happened slowly but I threw my life away. I didnt learn anymore. I didnt do homework. I ditched school. Fuck at some point I didnt even cared anymore to fake the excuse letter from my mom. I didnt care if anyone would point me out because I stand for what I do and what I did was selfdestructive behaviour! I switched school again and repeated the 9th grade because I thought a new beginning would help. It didnt. This was the worst school I ever was on. I hated everyone and everything. Only good part was I was able to only wake up at 7 am instead of 6. I thought I was an outsider before but this time I excluded myself actively from everyone. I couldnt stand the drama everyone always had. The fake personalitys and the lack of commitment to be a community. It was just horrible. And I am not only talking about the students. I remember I had like two teachers I could really connect to and they both told me to go back to my old school. That it was a down grade from my old one. But there was no going back. And I had ""only"" two years left until I could leave. The longest two years of my life. I did the old thing but worse. Ditching. Hating. No homework or learning. I had like only one B. At some point tho I decided that this shouldnt be my last memory of a school. I didnt even had to do something. I just decided to get better grades and I did. I just needed to listen in school and I got it. I didnt stop ditching and stuff but at least I would be able to get to 11th grade with this report (you need a special nevau to be allowed to). I managed to get only As Bs Cs and only one D but this was because of the teacher that wouldnt admit that I wrote my essay on my phone. She said that I probably took a screenshot. I shit talked her (not good I know) also because she didnt gave the bully of our class a chance to improve. I realized that by the way too and somehow managed to bring everyone to voting for him to be the head of the class. Our teacher said no. It was she. He really wanted to be a better person but got nothing from it so he got back to old behaviour. So I let that screenshot thing slide because I litterally had no energy to fight this. I took this F like I took all the others before. I just wanted to have nothing to do with this school anymore. And I left. And I started going to 11th grade. My grades dropped again. I ditched. And I left before I could finish the first year. I felt really bad about it. I have major self worth issues. Now I know it was depression at that time. I had anxiety and sometimes sensory overload. I was overthinking a lot. I started online school just to be alone for once in my life. I really wanted and still want my A-Levels. But I ditched that too some months ago. But right now I really am at a better place or on a good way there. I have some really good friends and looking at my reports tells me that I actually CAN make it. I just need to do it. I can ditch this too maybe (easier than before) but at least there is nothing anymore holding me down. Making me feel bad. Please wish me luck for my third try for my A-Levels!

In the past few weeks I have: 
- worked out consistently 
- strengthened the relationship with my dad 
- strengthened the relationship with my stepbrother 
- confessed to a good friend that my mom married another woman. (pretty insecure about it, don't wanna explain details) 

Things that I should do but haven't done: 
- start waking up earlier to prepare for school
- get on my pc and play with some old friends 
- come to terms with the fact that my parents will never be together again.

Things I should have done but was too afraid to do:
- talk to my mom about my insecurity regarding her marriage 
- confess to the girl I like 
- confess to the girl I like 
- confess to the girl I like 

Moments of peace: 
- I somehow woke up before sunrise and played music quietly and watched the sun rise
- I got up and ate breakfast in complete silence and listened to the birds and other sounds
- played my favorite video game for a few hours without interruption. Just genuine fun 
- took a nap with my dog &lt;3

For instance with bullies in my childhood, or with instances in my adult life where I couldve had a confrontation but I chickened out. 

I always thought that I want to be this strong person that can beat the shit out of anyone that challenges me. But I am far from that. And recently I havent been enjoying watching shows or movies where you see this guy that can act tough in any situation, because it always reminds me of how in my life, whenever im confronted with a bad situation, I always seem to take the safe way out. I try to rationalize it by thinking that avoiding confrontaiton with people who might antagonize me would be better than to get into a fight, and the endless thinking or fear of more confrontation that would result from a fight. Id tell myself that oh it probably wouldve gotten you into trouble maybe with the law even. But the the truth is, I cant live with any of these thoughts anymore.

39,"My life experience can be summarized as ""lucky,"" and I'm not sure if I deserve to be in my current position in life.

1. I got into IT because ""I got lucky"" to get into a diploma programme as it is relatively ""new"" (it was 2003, and one polytechnic offered a diploma in IT, but I had to specialize in ""mobile computing"", which, at that time, iPhone wasn't a thing yet, and we had to program for Symbian OS and Windows CE as part of our curriculum).
2. I got ""lucky"" to get into a vocation I wanted (during my mandatory National Service).
3. I got ""lucky"" to find work (most of the time). As a consequence, in my 13 years of my life, I jumped from hardware-based service provider, to web development, moving onto enterprise software (SAP), and currently to cloud infrastructure (think AWS, Azure &amp; Google Cloud). I worried that I might be a ""jack of all trades, a master of none,"" career-wise.
4. I got ""lucky"" to have an opportunity to study in a university, and subsequently working &amp; living in a different city and country.
5. I also got ""lucky"" that I was able to travel to other countries on my own free will and not because ""the family/the school/the club/the company planned it for me.""

And I wonder if I deserve it all, given how others are just ""merely fighting their way in life to get to a better spot."" I'm calling it as ""checking my own privileges,"" but that usually entails being in a majority race in country that is predominantly of that race; I'm not.

So why do I feel anxious about my future and wanting to pursue my own goals? I feel like the more ""I chase after something,"" the harder it is for me to get it. Likewise, I let serendipity take me to places where I'm comfortable at. Is this even OK for someone who's pushing 35?",13Aug2019,5
40,"Mark was a few years older than me. His younger brother was in my class, and I had been over to their house a few times. I didn't know him very well.

When I was in middle school, I was talking to his mom. I'm not sure how it came up, but she said that he had broken his leg. While he was laid up on the couch, he read the dictionary. When he was done with that, he read an entire encyclopedia. 

In high school, Mark and his brother got into drugs. It was pretty sad because I think both of their parents were drug addicts. 

As brilliant as Mark was, he could've been a doctor or something. Instead, he did whatever job he could find that wasn't to strict about testing for drugs. He had a job painting houses, which he seemed to like.

Mark didn't have a smart phone. He didn't want one. However, he always kept a book in his back pocket to read while he was on breaks at work. 

He did use Facebook, logging on from a computer. Most of his posts were nihilistic. He would often suggest various books to his friends. Even though we didn't talk much as kids, he did start commenting on my photos, and I started commenting on his; never really speaking to each other directly. 

Mark died of an unintentional heroin overdose. He was 31 years old. I think he led the life he wanted. I think he died the way he wanted. He didn't think there was a greater purpose in life. You are born, some stuff happens, and you die. Despite his own grim outlook on life, he was always genuinely happy for other people.

So I had just moved into this new neighborhood. I was like 10-11 years old and was a really innocent kid. The neighborhood was nice, I had made new friends and was living a happy life.  
ANYWAYS, one day I'm just sitting around watching some TV and my mom gives me some money and tells me to go get something from the shop. So I'm just waddling around towards the shop, and I reach the end of the street where you have to turn right to advance to the shop. Except.... I didn't turn right, because this 40-50 years old guy is just standing in the middle of the street with his pants down, HOLDING HIS PENIS. He seemed a little deranged because he was muttering nonsense while holding his penis. He was just holding his penis. He wasn't jacking off. He wasn't rubbing it. He wasn't looking horny or anything. He was just.... standing still muttering nonsense while holding his penis. And looking back, it was... there is no other way to say this, but it was.... really big.  
ANYWAYS, I had no idea what to do. Being a little kid, I guess I was scared of him? I shoulda turned around and went back in the house and told somebody, but I saw my friend coming out of his house nearby so I told him not to go there because there was somebody holding their penis. I stayed there for about 15 minutes and told any passerbys to not go there, and then I eventually went back home.  


  


Weeks later, I find out that guy actually lived in our neighborhood and he \*was\* a little crazy. If he didn't take his pills or something, he would go more crazy so I guess he hadn't taken his pills that day because no one in our neighborhood has seen him do something like that. I didn't tell anybody except my friend that it was him who was standing holding his penis.

He'd usually stick to drinking milkshakes since he told me these didn't cause any harm to him. He said he tried using a water filter but this didn't do anything.

He told me a month later he felt the effects get worse and so he avoided drinking water further. then later on he told me he'd run out of milk and was parched since it was hot and didn't feel like going to the store in the heat so he said he was going to try drinking water again. I didn't get any messages from him after that and I found out a few days later he was found dead in his bed apparently of asphyxiation. No new info came out but now I found Reddit I'm wondering what you guys think of this?

Wasn't sure where to put this so hoping someone can give me any closure",13Aug2019,3
46,"I’ll share my own. I was 15 and being bullied about being “flat” and “ a baby.” I’ve had bloody tampons thrown at my during school because my “best friend” told everyone the fact I hadn’t had my period. Literally I was basically shamed by my whole class of 300 some. My best friend was the guidance counselor ( bc of how often I was in her office.) I ate lunch alone, with her, or with the weird kids. 

Sooo.. I was home one night crying for some reason and I felt... wet. I think I checked my underwear 7 times and screamed at the top of my lungs. Because I got my period! I put a tampon in ( I watched 2640 videos on yt on how to put them in so I already knew.) When I say bounced I mean BOUNCED into school the next morning. I was still getting bullied but at least now I at least knew I didn’t have some sort of disorder or disease. :)",13Aug2019,3

Background: My hardworking mom is a teacher at a local university in my city in handicraft and stuff but the curriculum in my country has changed and so she is now one of the teachers in fashion design. In the past few years the city has recognized her talent in handicraft and fashion. So they usually hire her on the weekends to do extension projects so people can have some type of skill to help them build a business or find a job.

Story: A few weeks ago my mom was again hired by the city to do an extension project IN CITY JAIL! I was of course worried, I mean who wouldn't? It!s freaking city jail!!! But when my mom suddenly told me the lige storied of the inmates he encountered there. Of course she said it was scary at first but within the past few weeks of being there she saw how a lot of them were just misled by drugs and maybe poor upbringing. She even said one inmate is thinking of opening a tailoring shop once he comes out. Mom said he saw how a lot of them learned quickly and some even have a knack for fashion and they aren't gay btw. A lot of them are happy cause most of them have daughters and maybe they can use these skills they have acquired to bond with them when they het out.

50,"When I was a kid, we only had broadcast TV. The kind of TV where you had to angle the antennas just right, and only had half a dozen channels to choose from. When I was in middle school, my parents finally decided to get basic cable. We got around 60 channels, and at last I felt like I was able to watch and talk about all the TV shows my classmates were talking about.

Fast forward a couple of years. This is when all of TV was ""going digital"". As a promo, our cable provider was offering digital cable package to subscribers new and old. My parents decided to take advantage of the upgraded.

Now as part of the upgrade, the first month was free. Cool, right? So the next month comes, and we get no cable bill. This was before online payments really caught on. The month after that, still no bill.

My mom, being mostly religious (not that that's a bad thing), wanted to know why we weren't getting a bill. She called the cable provider to inquire. The representative told us that after our ""first free month"", we were booted out of their billing system. They assured us that we wouldn't be billed for the additional few months we got for free, but we would start getting charged going forward. 

But then we don't get a bill. After a few more months, my mostly religious mom called our cable provider again. Apparently, when they re-entered us into their billing system, it wasn't finalized or something. But anyway, they'll start charging us and won't charge us retroactively.

So we got about 4-6 months of free cable at this point, but we're going to have to start paying. Except we didn't. We STILL never got a bill! My mostly religious mom decided that she already told them about the issue, now it's their problem.

This went on for 2 or 3 years. 

One day, we got a call from the cable provider. They finally noticed their mistake. They apologized for the error, and again would not charge us retroactively for the years of free cable. But after that point, we did start getting billed on a monthly basis.

I could've sworn I've bought foot balm or lotion. My feet aren't getting any softer, so I guess foot/hand lotions do make a difference on different body parts.

I don't have terribly hard feet, just on the side of my big toe, a little bit under and the very bottom of my heel, those are hard, and the lotion I've picked up smells so good, a bit feminine, but I don't care, it's just a shame that I don't apply enough to show the smell, also I wear socks and shoes so it feels like *why is it even scented*.

I never care about categories of aromas, come to think of it. I wear a large spectrum of perfumes and smells, so it could go from men's cologne to unisex to mildly women's.

This is the first time this has ever happened to me. I take my dad grocery shopping because he's a vet with PTSD and he doesn't drive. It was him, myself, and two month old son. Usually we go in together, but I told my dad to go into the grocery store ahead of me and I'd meet him in there. I got my son out of the car and put his carseat in the cart. I put my purse up top where a child usually sits and started rolling the cart toward the entrance. I was maybe 50 feet from the door. A man started walking toward me and instinctively, I put my hand through the loops on my purse and steered the cart away from him. When he got right next to us, he lunged at me and tried to snatch the purse. I should have let him have it, but I wasn't thinking, I was just reacting. I was doing my best to keep him from taking it and held on for maybe 10-15 seconds, all the while screaming at the top of my lungs. That's when he pulled the cart down onto its side. With my baby son in it. My fucking newborn son, y'all. 

People came over and started helping me, someone called the police. The paramedics checked my son out and he seems to be okay. He went back to sleep shortly after the ordeal was over, which is normal for him. The cops took my statement and a bystander let me use her phone to call my boyfriend who left work and came quickly. Witnesses said he ran toward the street and jumped into an SUV. I have an idea that he was scoping out the parking lot and his friend was waiting in the parking lot to drive away afterwards. My purse had my phone, wallet with only a little bit of cash, my keys, and not much else of value. I don't even really care about the items inside it. He won't be able to sell the phone, my cards are turned off. He might be able to get a little money for the purse, it was a new Coach my boyfriend had just gotten me. 

I'm just pretty disturbed over the whole thing. I was targeted because I looked defenseless, and maybe because I'm a mother. He watched me. He purposely knocked the cart down with my baby in it so I would let go of the purse. I worried when I got home that he'd be inside my apartment because my ID had my address on it. I know it's normal to be scared and startled, but I'm worried he'll come to my home in a few days, maybe because he has my car keys and he'll try and take that, too.

We're changing the locks to our apartment and we're moving September 1st anyway. I reported my phone stolen and turned off all my cards, not that I think he'd use them [anyway.](https://anyway.My) My son wasn't hurt (thank god he was strapped in and those car seats are so durable) and I only have a few scrapes and bruises, so I know I was lucky. I'm just trying to figure out how to get past this. I can't even imagine going to the grocery store by myself now. I don't even want to carry a purse anymore. I want to take a self defense class and get a taser. 

I guess what I'm asking for is experience in situations like mine and how you moved past it. I don't want to let this control me.",13Aug2019,2

63,"All art, posters and films about the future made me think that the progress was something that would come no matter what, if you just waited long enough. The more time passed, the more advanced technology would become, the more things would be discovered. Every time i thought about the future of humans, it always started with ""when""; ""When humanity will reach other stars"", ""When humans will get to live hundreds of years thanks to advanced medicine,"" etc. I never thought that the ""when"" could actually be ""if"".

Now i realize that no matter how big and powerful you are, or how many of you are in the world, no one is safe from the laws of life. Humanity could get really unlucky and perish from something too powerful for them to avoid or deal with. Or people could do something really stupid and destroy themselves with their own efforts. They might even just lose all motivation to keep the progress going, decide that they are content with whatever they have and stop going any further.

These kinds of thoughts make looking at everything around me feel pretty weird. Before, every time i woke up i thought ""can't believe i am still alive and having progress""; now it's slowly turning into ""can't believe the humanity is still alive and having progress"".

66,"In early 2003, my mother got the courage to write Fred Rogers a letter. In it, she detailed how his show had taught her how to be a good mother. My mom's family was poor and ravaged by alcoholism. Her mother was abusive and neglectful, and her father was an adulterer and chronic gambler. When she had her children, she would watch his program with us, and learn how to be a good parent through the unconditional love of Mister Rogers. 
He wrote her back, thanking her for her openness and candor. He said he was so happy that his program could help her, and said he would pray for her children. In times of hurt and hardship, I draw comfort from the fact that Mister Rogers, at some point, offered a prayer to God for me. It was just three days after my mom received that letter, that Mister Rogers died. 
His death brought the country to an odd place. He was a children's entertainer on the surface, but deeper down, he helped shape American culture throughout the 70s, 80s, and 90s. His show ran for 31 seasons and received many, many accolades. He won Emmys, received a Lifetime Achievement Award, and was lauded as one of the greatest men of his time by multiple world leaders. In his acceptance speech after he was given that Lifetime Achievement Award, he told the audience to stop, and think about the people who helped shape who they were. The audience began to cry, and multiple celebrities told him afterwards that he was one of those people. 

Mister Rogers lived every minute of his life in service of others. Even when he was sitting down to eat, he ate healthy, portioned meals, knowing he had to stay at his best in order to best serve the children he loved so deeply. He swam laps every morning, ate his vegetables, and spent time reflecting on life's events and curiosities. He studied many religions, but remained a faithful Christian his whole life. He never forced his religious views on his audience or friends, and never scorned anyone for disagreeing with him on that point. He was fair, progressive, and kind in all things. He was even an advocate against animal cruelty. 
He went out of his way to do the small and big things that changed people's lives. He would take every opportunity he could to make people smile, and he truly, honestly, and endearingly loved all his neighbors. 

Mister Rogers had a big impact on me as a child. I was lonely, and afraid as a kid. I was severely bullied, and had few friends, but when I came home from school, I had Mister Rogers to tell me that I was loved, and that I mattered. That's what he was all about, and that's the beautiful gift he gave me. 

When I am at the end of my life, I will ask myself a question; a question I hope I can answer ""yes"" to. Would Fred Rogers be proud of me?",13Aug2019,16

The issue is, I don't make a whole lot of money and though I could technically afford a place costing $120,000, I wouldn't have anything to add into savings after my monthly bills. So, I've been looking at housing in the $80,000 range. There are some good houses for that amount, but they are in a not so great part of town.

I do not have a kid, but my girlfriend does, and we have talked about eventually moving in together down the road. The best house I can afford, and that is perfect in most every way, still has 3 sex offenders 3 blocks down from the house. I checked their records online, they are the rape/attempted rape type of sex offenders, not the exposed themselves in the park type.

Unless I get a new job, and start making a lot more money, I wont be able to afford a house away from the sex offender neighborhoods.

I then thought we were on the same page because he said he agreeed with me that he was happy to just get to know me . Then two weeks ago I met him but there was a group of us and we enjoyed the night but nothing happened between us but I had an awful feeling he wanted alone time with me to try and go with me and I didn’t really want that . The following night his friend kept at me to go into his car with him or for them to go out with us etc and I just said ‘ come out if yous want’ cause I wasn’t going to make them go to a pub if they didn’t want to . They didn’t do so and they got mad cause I wouldn’t go with them. That’s when I panicked that the boy was going to bring up the whole relationship conversation again even though we had spoken about it before . That night I had kissed someone but there was nomeaning to it . That boy found out and messaged me giving out saying he had no time for that shit and all this . After that I replied and said that I didn’t really have feelings for him but we already had the discussion a few weeks ago and I was willing to be friends etc. I got mad about this so I just didn’t reply . That’s been it since . But he has told my friend that if he sees me out soon and he has a drink that he will start a row with me .

76,"My apologies if this is rambling, this situation is pretty stressful and I don't know how to handle it.

About a month ago, I posted to AITA about dropping out of a service trip. To make a long story short, the woman who runs the service trip program at my school told me that I would be at one location then randomly changed it to a much more dangerous area that I do not feel safe going to. I dropped out of the trip, but I offered to help with all pre-trip stuff since I originally volunteered to lead the trip, and the trip itself isn't until December, so she does have time to find a replacement for me.

The other day, I got an email from her demanding to meet in person as soon as I'm back on campus. It wasn't necessarily *aggressive*, but you could tell in her writing that she was pretty irritated with me. The only reason that I could think of for why she wants to meet so badly is because she is going to try and guilt me into still leading the trip. Honestly, why would she want someone to lead a trip so badly if they tried to drop out? I know for a fact they rejected some people for the position, couldn't she pull someone off that list and ask if they still wanted to lead a trip?

I hate ignoring people, but that's what I've been doing. I still haven't responded to her email because I don't know how to without coming off as a jerk. I feel horrible for dropping the trip in the first place, but I cannot jeopardize my own safety for a trip.

Study Link: [https://research.sc/participant/login/dynamic/1B4BD574-6556-404E-A4CA-F66BDB1A84DE](https://research.sc/participant/login/dynamic/1B4BD574-6556-404E-A4CA-F66BDB1A84DE)

**What do we mean by future thoughts?**

In this study, we are interested in any thoughts you may experience that are future-oriented. Future thoughts can be goals, plans, predictions, expectations, daydreams, or worries we experience concerning our personal future.

**What does the study involve?**

The study is divided into two parts. Part 1 will involve you keeping a record of the number of future thoughts you experience over **1 day** (of your choice) using a smartphone app (details of this app will be provided). In part 2, we will ask you to briefly describe 10 everyday future thoughts and rate these thoughts on several characteristic scales over a maximum period of **5 days**. We anticipate that your participation will take roughly **1 hour - 1 hour, 15 minutes** in total.

**You must be between the ages of 18-30 years** ***and*** **have access to a smartphone to participate in this study. The study link should be accessed via a desktop computer or tablet only.**

**I would like to participate, what should I do now?**

If you are interested in participating, please follow the study link provided below. **NOTE:** The study will ask you to log in with a **participant ID**. Your unique participant ID is generated via a combination of your **initials**, **date of birth (DD-MM-YYYY)** and the last **4 digits** of your **mobile phone number** i.e. AG26-07-1996-2862. Please use this to log into the study and keep a note of it, as you will need your ID to access the study throughout your participation.

Unfortunately, at this time we are not able to offer any reimbursement for participation.

83,"I have the most perfect and angelic foster dog that just got rejected by a family for the dumbest reason. Her name is Luna and she’s a pittie which already puts her under that stereotype which therefore makes people less interested in her. She walked up to a pet store with no tag or chip and she’s around 3. She is quite literally perfect though: potty trained, low maintenance, super sweet, calm, will eat all her food no problem, great with other dogs and kids of all ages, loves to swim, etc.  I mean you could do anything to her and she would never complain, protest, or remotely get aggressive. 

This family showed interest in her and she did great. She checked absolutely everything off their list. They have another dog that she did great with and was so gentle with all their kids. They asked every question in the book and she passed with flying colors. I even did two meetups with them which she did amazing in except for the end of the second.

 I drove 40 minutes to their house with her so they could see her in a home setting. The kids loved her and were playing with her the whole time it was perfect and at the beginning the only thing she was doing wrong was getting on their couch but she would hip right off if you asked her too. The meeting was coming to an end and the parents seemed really satisfied with the meeting but I could tell they were being overly precautious. In the last few minutes Luna started humping their kids. It sounds a lot worse than it was. She was just showing her dominance and I told the parents that. But there was no problem getting her to stop they just moved her to the side and that was it plus the kids thought it was funny and that she was just hugging them.
 
I got a text later saying they wanted to do a trial run with her and that the only thing they were concerned about was her showing her dominance. I thought that was fine anyways as the humping would’ve been very temporary as she’d barely known who they were. It’s not behavior she would do her whole life just till she gets to know them. I was so excited for the trial run as I knew they’d see how great she was and fall in love as their kids did. Instead of getting a text back about going on a trial I got one saying they were no longer interested. 

I tried to ignore it but once I started talking to my parents about it, it really got to me. I just started sobbing. I’ve only had her for 2 months but I just can’t understand how they could turn away the dog that was perfect for their family. She was an angel with them and gave them no reason to turn them away besides something that is so normal and very temporary. I just know how amazing of a dog she is and it makes me so sad that even after a family got to know her that they would still turn her away. Every time I think about it I get really sad. Any other fosters out there who have gone through this or any words of wisdom? Anything would help.",13Aug2019,3
84,"Let me begin by saying that I am very open to being corrected if I say something problematic. I grew up in a small town where problematic comments were common and after I left, I made a point to correct this learned behavior. Lately she has been fairly confrontational about different things to point out my privilege. I am a cis white female currently making around $42,000 so I understand that I have a lot of privilege. I never deny this. However, as an example, I recently broke my leg and was just hit with about $3,500 worth of medical bills. I went to her to vent my frustrations and her response was “well at least you aren’t in abject poverty” and continued with this tone throughout the conversation. These medical bills are more than a month and a half of income for me so it WILL be extremely stressful and very costly for me to pay this. She only continued to point out how much privilege I have compared to other people who could receive a surprise medical bill. I know this is somewhat a rant but I just am looking for advice on how to approach this subject with her for a third time without her responding with “well you do say some problematic things”. Again, I’m working on growing and not being ignorant and I own up to the mistakes when I make them.",13Aug2019,4
85,"I'm all for questioning the system, seeking alternative news sources, and exposing cover-ups where possible, but those who are new to reddit may not realize how the rest of this site views r/conspiracy and may get caught up in their rhetoric. And with Epstein's ""suicide"", many newer users have gone to this subreddit to add a few deserved layers of tinfoil to their hat. What follows is a brief overview of that sub for those who may not be aware:


It started out as exactly what you wanted and/or expected from a subreddit called r/conspiracy. Fun Theories, a chill community, and some respected crazies that made things interesting. People would still be called out for denying the holocaust.


Then 2016 rolled around and r/the_donald reached its peak and people noticed r/conspiracy was becoming more hateful, politicized, and the ""((they))"" tagging became an extremely common sight.


In case you don't know, the parentheses around a word like that is way to say the ""the Jews"" without actually saying ""the Jews"".


Holocaust denial and Clinton bashing became more widely accepted in that sub during that time. 


Only the Clinton-bashing wasn't necessarily a bad thing, but it was vividly more pronounced than anything anti-right wing. With many people shouting ""MAGA, drain the swamp, getting people brown coats"" (or was it redcoats, I forgot) Which, is of course, spill over for the Trump subreddit .


Then hate subs started to get quarantined or straight out banned, and many user found safe refuge in r/conspiracy, turning the angry rhetoric up to 11. This is when many people in that sub started putting down any source of news that they saw as ""liberal propaganda"". 


Also, One of the main mods is a proud anti-vaxxer, where he would post his ""research"" on the subject, get downvoted, delete his post and then repost it as a sticky and call out all the shills who were trying to hide his grand work.


So just be mindful, take that subreddit with a grain of a salt, and realize r/conspiracy is a safe place for many people who frequented many of the subs that were banned for hate and violence.",13Aug2019,1

I know there are others who love me, and they'd be devastated, so I just keep going, but always hoping for some miracle of an accident.

I'm sure I wouldn't last long as a homeless bum, because I just flat out don't give a fuck about much of anything anymore.

102,"I'm 29 and graduated with a degree in Spanish in 2014. Taught for a year, got laid off, and didn't want to be a teacher anymore. I spent a year temping from 2015 to 2016, it was the hardest year of my life. I worked for 7 different places, got fired from one and the rest were temp contracts that went nowhere. That took a lot out of me. From 2016 to 2019 I worked at 3 different places, each for about a year, all administrative type work. The past two jobs I have had, I feel like they just squeezed as much life  out of me as possible. 

I'm so burnt out now. My husband got a job opportunity in the San Fran area , so we moved here from the east coast and I wanted to make a big career change but I feel so stuck. I'm so tired of applying and going on interviews, I feel like I've been doing it nonstop since 2015. I've seen a career counselor type person, I've gone to a ""find your career"" workshop, seen a therapist, nothing has really helped me find direction in my life. I don't have a passion I can turn into a career. And I don't feel strong enough anymore to just grind through a career that doesn't really interest me. My therapist had recommended I try to get into publishing, since I love to write. I have tried but it seems like a dead end without the right connections and education. I don't want to take out loans for more schooling.

So I'm kind of alone in this new city, except for my husband, who is stressed in his new job. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of jobs where I get treated like shit. I've considered coding, speech language pathologist, EEG technician, organizational psychologist, librarian, physical therapist, translator, I can't really picture investing the time and energy into those careers and doing them long term.

I'm home alone all day doing a lot of nothing. I've been trying to write a book but I keep petering out. I have no spark anymore, no energy. 

Also, I never needed anti-depressants to function before entering the working world. But from the day I started teaching until now, it's the only way I can function in a full time job. I hate that.

I’ll miss a few relatives like my sister and dad. I’ll miss my maternal grandparents. But everyone else is indifferent to me.

The one reason I get excited for school while most other students dread returning is because I can get away from my mother. To keep this short, my mother is not a nice woman. I would have never described her as an exceptionally caring and kind person, but during the last few years, she seems to have taken a turn for the worse. (And before anyone asks, yes, I am subscribed to r/raisedbynarcissists.)

Do I feel guilty about not having a good relationship with her? Yes, even though it’s not entirely my fault. I deal with that guilt by remembering that she (and the rest of my family, for that matter) would never accept me if she knew who I really was. I’m a bisexual atheist and I live in the South. I’m sure you know how popular we are in the Bible Belt 😅. 

The rest of my family is only guilty of gaslighting (and favoring my sister over me, but that’s another story). 

When I go to my college town, an hour and a half away, I can be my true self. I’m surrounding by more supportive, kinder people. I’ve accepted that I can’t be best friends with my mom like other girls my age are. I’m mostly okay with that. I know things aren’t likely to change any time soon, at the very least.

For context, there is a local grocery chain where I'm from called Schnucks and their logo looks like that (or at least used to). I don't have anything against the grocery chain I just thought it was a really funny shirt that any local would understand.


So I sent the picture to some friends and showed my family and they all thought it was great, too. I wanted to get one for myself and someone on /r/StLouis was kind enough to point me in the direction of the seller. The thread got quite a few upvotes so I thought buying one would be a great idea.


So fast forward a week, I've got my new shirt, washed it, and am ready to go out with itin public. When I went to grab my car keys, I saw my mom and I said ""Hey, I'm wearing my new shirt.""


She responded ""You know what a schmuck is right?""


""Yeah, like a bum or something,"" I replied.


She laughed and said ""No, a schmuck is a penis.""


My entire life I've only heard the word said in the way that you'd call someone a fool but sure enough Google gave me the Yiddish origins of the word. My shirt said Penises.

Her no clearly signalled that all my chances were gone or more aptly put that I had none to begin with but you don't immediately lose your crush on someone once they say no (at least I don't). Everything got a whole lot easier when I graduated about one year ago. I didn't see her anymore, the feelings went away, or so I thought. Last weekend I was at a birthday party of a mutual friend of ours and I saw her for the first time since last summer and the feelings were still there.

- listen to your favourite music
- read a book
- watch some funny videos online

Although I don't work on weekends, there are times in the middle of the week that I just feel so burned out that I have to stop and just stay at home. Luckily, my bosses are amazing people who don't actually question me when I take a leave. I think the key is not to choose a day where a lot of meetings or important events are taking place and to make sure that you don't leave a task unfinished.

What do I do on my mental health days? I lounge around bingeing on Netflix or going to the movies by myself. I also catch up on some reading. Basically anything that can relax or relieve me of stress. 

Sometimes, I even work from home on my MH days. For some reason, the comfort of my home (and couch haha) significantly reduces the burnout I feel and I could edit reports while I'm in the house.
