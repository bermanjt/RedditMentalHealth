This is not that universe. This is the universe where I swallowed them and passed out in the bathroom, woke up days later, and survived.

This is the ""bad ending"". This is where there is no solace. This is where I fuck everything up and cause suffering on a mass scale.

That's all. I did wrong. I cannot undo what destruction my actions have brought. I have limited options to reduce my future impact, but damage has already been done.

I've fucked up. I'm a horrible person. I can't undo any of this. Fuck.",08Jul2019,1

Now, he’s still alive, thankfully, but he keeps saying he’s getting closer to the edge, and I don’t want him to die, but I don’t know what I can do to help him out. All I can do is offer to lend an ear, but he keeps saying that he doesn’t want to bother me with it, and I’m getting really scared. I don’t know what to do or say other than tell him I don’t want him to die, but I don’t think that’s enough.",08Jul2019,1
4,"Some time ago i've ended my 5 year relationship with girlfriend. I can't say I didn't loved her, but my life started to be complete mess because of her and her life.

She was shy as hell, had no friends apart from the internet, had complexes and she was a wreck of a man. I was like a father for her as well, because her dad went to another country for work.

Everything was good between us. I can even say that was perfect. She started to lose some weight, care more about herself. But after that she started to get friends, she always spend more time with them then with me. And I cant blame her, everyone needs friends in life. Problem was when she was going out with them, things between us became more problematic. But this story isn't even about ex and relationship with her.

Short time after we started dating i've meet another girl on a ""party"". There was like 5 people counting me. In one evening we've started to behave like we were best friends for a really long time. Almost even kissed. But because what happened to my mother (her ex-partner left her alone with 2 kids alone when he meet another woman) I would never betrey my gf. We was in really good contact for a long time. After 3 years of our friendship we even was going out alone and had a talk about being together. But I said her I cant do something like that to my gf but she respected that. That's long story short of all that happend.

Right now, she is for almost a year in relationship and I'm feeling like dumbest man alive. We are still in good contact, but I've wasted 5 years on being with a gril that was destroying me and my life, and in the end all I heard from her she don't love me anymore. Maybe it wont make between me and this other girl, but I would be much happier. And now I have to work on my shitty life, be unhappy, depressed, alone and look on her being with that dude.

I had to say it here, because I don't have anyone I can talk about this.

8,"Hey, 

I want to work on a few qualities that are extremely shitty in myself and I would like to change. I don't know where to start and would appreciate any help you can give me. 

1. I have mood swings. At one moment I can be happy as a clam, the next I'll be sad.
2. I am extremely petty. If I got into a confrontation with another person, I would wait for them to contact me and basically close myself out to anyone and not reach out.
3. I am too competitive in games. We played a few games a few days ago and I would get under everyone's skin with winning and teasing. I need this to stop. I think it stems from my house, where we are 4 brothers and my second brother being competitive all the time when we play. 

I would appreciate any resources to help me better myself in those areas and Amy tips that you might have used to combat those qualities in your life.",08Jul2019,1
9,"9 years ago, in the heyday of Obama, the National Archives Museum in Washington DC made a stupid decision to ban visitor photography (and VIDEOGRAPHY TOO) inside the Rotunda AND the Exhibition Areas.

&amp;#x200B;

Touted as a safety measure for the documents (they have faded miserably over the years), the ban has been met with outrage. The Museum submitted this decision for public review, but only 3 people protested the policy. However, their protests did not do any good, as a final rule stating that the UV protection glass was being replaced with clear glass over the documents, in order to view them in their true color, because the UV glass made a green tint on the documents, ruining the experience. Also, with the advent of automatic flash on digital cameras and smartphones, the ""no-flash"" policy was too difficult to enforce, so, stupidly enough, a blanket ban on photography and videography was instituted. Only professional photographers with permission can take pictures inside the building.

&amp;#x200B;

My take on this ban: THIS IS SO FUCKING STUPID!!! STUPID DEMOCRATS CONTROLLING US?! Should they have already known that people CAN turn off automatic flash? Should we use spy cameras inside the building? I disagree with this ban, and I think that people should buy a spy camera (glasses camera would be best, as it's more discreet), and not have to worry about some wannabe TSA agent reprimanding them about their deed.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I have a solution to this problem. My idea would be to offer visitors of the National Archives a rental iPod Touch, preloaded with a special app that takes pictures safely without flash. Then, at the end of their visit, visitors can email their pictures to their own phone, and the iPod Touch is returned. This new idea would boost visitor rates, allow for more photos of the Rotunda to be shared on the Web, and effectively take pictures without damaging the documents.

&amp;#x200B;

Time will tell when this idea would come to pass. If anyone likes this idea, be sure to contact the National Archives ([https://museum.archives.gov/contact-us](https://museum.archives.gov/contact-us)) and share it with them, so that they can really have the solution that they just need. You won't hurt my feelings. Honest.",08Jul2019,1

11,"I have nowhere else I can say this, and nobody to confess to in real life without being teased relentlessly, so I am confessing and getting it off my chest here.

I'm a college freshman wrapping up my first year. I'm not fat, but i'm like slightly chubby...think ""freshman 15"" type of beer belly from heading to a few parties. Huge bookworm. Deans List 4.00 GPA student. Head of the Young Republicans' Club.

A few weeks ago I was taking a shower home alone on a sunny day at noon and I heard a thump at the backdoor. I was expecting a new videogame, and of course I forgot my towel upstairs.

Instead of running all the way up 2 flights of stairs and back down, I figured, what's the harm in creeking open the door, grabbing the game and running upstairs? Who would know?

I opened the door and a freaking gigantic HORNET swoops in. I panic and sidestep to avoid it...and I end up OUTSIDE on the patio.

I stumble backwards awkward where I am just about to fall down the back steps but catch myself, arms FLAILING wildly (must have been the most absurd sight ever), but staying upright.

And the door slammed.

I rushed to the door, my bare ""bubble butt"" (as my friend Ashley always like to tease me and call it) jiggling shamefully as I desperately turned the doorknob to no avail.

The hornet was now inside my cool, air-conditioned home.

And I was outside in the sunny heat.

Butt-naked as a jaybird.

Cheeks blushing red. Lily-white from the base of my neck to my toes.

2 hours later I am standing behind a small waist-high bush, using it as a fig leaf like a modern day Adam, and I finally remembered where the spare key was. Behind the garage, under the rock by the left trashcan. Taking a deep breath, I took off running. Butt-naked in broad daylight. I streaked all the way across the lawn and back, got inside, ran my naked ass upstairs and was blushing for the next 3 days.

15,"I'm the oldest son of a blended family. My parents are divorced and my mom remarried whom I live with most of the time. I'm also about to go to college so a lot is changing in my life. For about the 10th time in about 2 months this evening, my mom offered for me to join my brother, stepdad, and her to watch a new TV show. I declined and I stated my opinion once again on consuming entertainment.

Now, I have nothing against TV shows and movies. In fact, I've seen many of them and some I even liked. To me though, I see it as a time waster and not a positive time filler. I generally only like watching such things alone and not with other people because of it not being very social.

My mom tried to justify her stance as that it would allow us to spend time as a family and to have something else to talk about. I found this to be an unacceptable excuse. Nothing is social about watching TV and if my mother wants something to talk about, there's many things. What plans does everyone have for the week, what will everyone be doing, and other topics like this. Even some of the more sensitive subjects that have been routinely avoided such as my repetitive issues with my stepdad. Even then, there's far better things we could do as a family. We could go to the pool, go visit friends and extended family, or even go for a night out on the town. We have the possibility to create our own stories but instead, we feed off of another person's hyperbolic fictitious tales placed into a dramatic frame to view.

I've realized though I'm not the only person that deals with this. In fact, it is many living in society and we see this all around us. Everyone wants to know the next Game of Thrones season (thank God that's over), talking about the new Chernobyl series, and all the buzz about the next movie coming up and when. We even can see this in pop culture with TV advertisements pandering towards people's boredom and inadequacy with their life by offering more movies to watch and more channels to browse on cable. Even this phrase called ""Netflix and chill"" which is associated as one of the staples of a romantic relationship.

So this is a modern family looks like; even what some contemporary relationship appears to be: A bunch of people burying their own boredom with themselves and their feelings of living an unhappy life poured into clicking on a TV remote or browsing on their computer. Too many people afraid to create their own stories or live their life as their own hero of the plot of which they can control if they chose to. It's like an addiction such as alcohol or painkillers. All of us wanting a quick fix but not putting the real work into it or looking for the right source to relieve the pressure.

1. I need to secure a job. Currently, the job interview you went on seemed promising so we will see if I can get that since it would be a great starting job.
2. Move out of my parent's house. Seems like the most logical next step
3. Go to the doctor (this one is kind of threefold)

a. Dermatologist (acne isn't going away on its own)

b. Dietician or Nutritionist (I'm generally not great at cooking but I also have a condition and need help)

c. Therapist (just cause, I mean I'm writing out this post so something is loose)

4.   Get back into working out (5/3/1 and Cardio cause your routine was great) Set a goal for lifting 3X and cardio 1X

5. Get back into open mics, your stand up was getting a lot better, its a great and cheap hobby

6. Go visit your friends (why did they have to go to different states!)

7. Make a bucket list of fun stuff to do (list inside a list)

24,"“Thank you for being you because you reminded me that I am me.” 
It’s lengthy but it’s worth it and I needed to share this. 

I’m a 30 something year old woman. The first a little over two decades of my life were interesting. I was worldly. I was fun. I lacked fundamental self-confidence but I managed it. I was the fun friend. We partied, we drank, you could count on me for house parties, clubs, to just chill, to chase an adrenaline high, whatever you wanted. I was the “fuck it, I’ll do it!” friend. I went after people I wanted. We had FUN. 

But somewhere after my early twenties, I lost that. I no longer managed my insecurities - they managed me. I developed anxiety. I met a man who loved me but he had demons. His demons loved my demons and they tore the good in us down. It wasn’t his fault, but I got lost in us. I was still the “fun” friend, but I was the friend that wore bright colors or fun earrings, the friend who was sassy when people were rude. I mean, I worked and I am dedicated to my job and I’m good at it but that’s all I was. I laughed a lot but the girl who crossed a bar and made out with beautiful strangers after piecing together a conversation from our three different languages didn’t exist any more. This new me shuddered at the thought of “peopling”. 

And then I went on a vacation and met a 21 year old man. He’s at least a decade younger than me. He worked at the hotel. We flirted a little bit. He was beautiful, but I didn’t take him too seriously. He was good at banter which I love so we engaged in that, but I didn’t consider anything else. I saw him again, we bantered and flirted but again, nothing serious. He was a flirt- he could flirt with anyone. 

And then I saw him later, flirting with some barely legal girls. Beautiful girls. Girls that were so beautiful that never even on my best day in my prime did I look like that. But something in me was challenged in that moment. 

Now, I had been drinking. And I’ve always been competitive. But even drunk me has anxiety. So I don’t know what it was about this beautiful man, but I just decided that no. I don’t want to be this easily over looked. So I went up to him, pulled him aside and told him that. I told him, listen I know these little girls are beautiful, but working this job, you’ll have more fun spending that energy with older women. We flirted some more, he laughed that I considered myself “older”. 

I ended up hanging out with him and his friends after closing. On the beach in one of the most beautiful places in the world. We sat and talked and laughed. And then he started touching me. He had his hands on my hips, my stomach. On places of my body that I hated. Places that when people have touched them in the last ten years I immediately cringed, convinced they would find those places disgusting. 

But this man touched them. And there was something in the way he touched me that made me feel appreciated. I don’t know what he did exactly, what was different, but he was grabbing handfuls of my body and I truly felt him appreciate those handfuls. It was soft and tender and I felt.... seen. Appreciated. 

We eventually ended up having sex on a covered beach chair. It was beautiful. It was goofy. It was risky. It was awkward. It was sexy. He was soft and aggressive and I felt sexy. We’d do something and my insecurities would flair up. But only for a second because he would touch my body in his way and it just melted those anxieties away. I don’t know what magic he had, but it spoke to me. 

I left that beach with a smile, underwear shoved in my purse, and hickeys on my neck. First I berated myself. How could you do that?! You’re an adult. Bare assed on the beach with a man barely old enough to be called a man. 

And then I realized... look how bad ass that was. I used to be that girl. I used to be someone who marched across a bar, sashayed myself up against the most beautiful women and felt like I belonged. I used to be the woman who had fun. Who was bold and confident and unapologetic.  I went to one of the most beautiful places in the world and had vacation sex with a gorgeous younger man on the beach. Like it’s the plot of every vacation romance novel and I lived it. 

I left the next day feeling rejuvenated, but my insecurities were boiling. The need to berate myself was bubbling just below my surfaces 
And then this sweet, beautiful man continued talking to me on social media. I’ll probably never see him again, we both know that. He could have disappeared into the night and his memory faded with the hickeys on my neck. 

But we’re still talking. It’s not serious, it’s just flirting. I know we’ll fade off and just be a story we tell. But his continued attention softened those anxieties. 

He didn’t do anything but be himself, in his 20s, gorgeous and sweet. But him being him, reminded me who I am. 

That night changed my life. I walked off that beach the confident woman I buried under anxiety years ago. 

So thank you, to that sweet beautiful Caribbean man. I am healing myself because he made me feel beautiful. He made me worthy. Appreciated. Not for a second did he make me second guess what I brought to the table. 
Thank you for being you because you reminded me that I am me. ❤️",08Jul2019,1

27,"So, backstory, before my now boyfriend, I only dated my ex from 17-22. We were off and on. I went on dates with other people and had flings in those times, but nothing serious ever happened. 

I finally decided that I was going to end it for good (the relationship wasn’t awful, I just had fallen out of love and knew I couldn’t force it any longer) and for about a year I’ve been single. 

I’ve honestly really liked it. It’s the longest I’ve ever been single since I was 17. I dated here and there, and was “exclusive” for a few months but that ended. Now I met someone else and we decided to make it official. 

But I feel so WEIRD about it. I really like him, he’s great and we get along so well. We’ve even hung out together for 4 days 24/7 and managed to not get tired of each other (obviously honeymoon phase, but as an introvert that’s a big deal to me). 

I was anxious about clarifying what we were, and I wanted to be his girlfriend. But now that I am I can’t help but feel anxious about it. A fear of commitment maybe? Maybe it’s because I’ve only ever had one boyfriend? Maybe I’m not ready? It’s just weird because I wanted it to happen, and now that it did I feel weird.

This will likely be a very boring read and will probably be a soapbox where I complain about things that I have only myself to blame. I'm not looking for sympathy, I just want to vent

You have been warned.

I'll start with my degree choice. I've always been a music lover and throughout high school was known as the smart musical guy. So, I figured I'd make a career out of it by joining the music industry but taking the technological side of it. Perhaps a studio engineer, live engineer, or sound designer for media. I enjoy the field and find it all super interesting, but the one thing I severely underestimated was how competitive and lucky you need to make even a living in it. I often have mild panic attacks where the thought of ""what am I doing with my life"" echos in my mind constantly for a couple hours.

By no means do I need any formal education for this field of work. Everything can be self taught and networking is the main way to land a job. 2 years into my degree I now realize that I should've stayed away from college or chose a different degree all together. And no I can't just drop out or change my major. I won't get into that.

Speaking of college, I picked one of the worst places to study this subject. The program is an absolute mess and the school hardly cares about the program at all. It is essentially run by students who have been lucky enough to have real world experience and people learn mainly on their own time out of class.

The only good thing that has come out of college is networking. I've met some incredible and talented people and I can't wait to see what they achieve in the future! I have been extremely fortunate in my time there so far, and through meeting a couple upper classmen, I have had the very rare opportunity to work on campus doing things related to sound engineering. That is where I have gained most of my knowledge in the field and I love doing it. I also managed to snag a job working as a live sound engineer this summer thanks to an upperclassman as well.

I hate it.

I hate this line of work. Maybe (hopefully) it's just the company I'm working for, but what I am doing is one of the easiest jobs on the planet. A middle school dropout would be overqualified for what I do. My schedule is random, I normally don't know if I work tomorrow until the end of the day and the work is mind numbingly repetitive and am paid very poorly. Of course I know I dont have a right to complain. I did this to myself. I plan to quit at the end of the summer and return to college where I will bust my ass, building a portfolio in sound design and apply for an internship at a production company of some sort. I have done sound design as a hobby and I think I'll enjoy that line of work more.

All this has ultimately led to what I can only self diagnose as a very mild form of depression. I rarely find joy in doing the things I used to, I experience anxiety more often than I have before, I have no motivation to start a new hobby, I dread going to work every night before I go to bed and as soon as I wake up, I feel like I'm wasting my life, and I worry I have no future.

But I'm sure things will turn around as soon as college starts back up. I'll be able to see my friends and faculty again, I have plenty of extracurriculars I enjoy doing, and I'll be enjoying the work I do again. This has just been a rough period for me recently and it feels good to be able to write this all out.

i am very fond of video games. i play many things on my ps4 and on pcs in gaming cafes. but recently my dad has limited my ps4 playing time and he doesent let me go to the cafe anymore. he says i shouldnt invest in games, which is my hobby. thats also making me feel bored all day. accompanied by the sense im wasting my summer.

thats just it. im feeling really sad and really useless at the same time. i see message pings on my phone of my friends playing together and i cant join them because my parents wont let me. it makes me feel really left out.

33,"Since our wedding everyone is asking this from us.

Before the wedding I was diagnosed with a very nasty cist on my cervix, which was infected with the HPV virus. It wasn´t cancerous, but I needed surgery ASAP. The cist was removed, but I can´t have children.

Before this, I always thought, asking someone when they are going to have children is waaay to inappropriate. Like asking how many times they are having sex. And I never asked it from anyone. But now... it hurts. And always leads to an awkward silence in the conversation, with us muttering something like ""everything has time"" or similar BS, because obviously, I don´t want to talk about my problems with my MIL´s former coworker. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day, we were out shopping with my husband and a friend (more like a person we know) came to us. She had one of her babies in a stroller and an older toddler sitting on her hip, in her arms. It was a few weeks, after my doctor told me, that the probability of having children, ever, is very low. So even the sight of this made me sad, but I smiled, trying not to think about my situation. Then she asked: ""And what about you? When are you going to start a family?"". Like a family can only be if you have kids. **Living together, having the same name does not make us family with my husband, obviously.** The awkward muttering came, I held up for a little while, at least until we got rid of her, and then started to cry. I cried so hard, my husband led me to the car and took me home and finished the shopping later that day.

&amp;#x200B;

For some time after this incident, maybe a few weeks, I did´t even got out of the house except for work. I didn´t want to see anyone, especially not the friends with kids, because I knew they will ask. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now it´s better, it does not hurt so badly, but still kills any conversation. Please, stop asking this question from everyone! You don´t know what is happening in that persons life. It´s inappropriate and can hurt.  

Now, that I´m a bit better, I´m thinking about responding with: ""We will see. **But hey, how often do you have sex now that you have kids?**""",08Jul2019,2

The last year has a been a bit of a whirlwind.. suffering from CPTSD and anixety due to some childhood trauma. I had suppressed it until last year and I have been dealing with it since. I took 6 months off from work. My background is in hospitality as an operations manager for multi-site businesses. I have now gone back into hospitality to manage one place which is great and easy going and not too intense considering the circumstances.

But, during the 6 months I was really trying to get into marketing agencies or non for profit. I really want to make a difference in the work I do and don't feel that way when I work in hospitality.

47,"Yesterday evening, my girlfriend dropped off some food for me but my mom didn’t see her. When I started to sit down to eat it she asked who it was and I told her it was my girlfriend. Later on that night she texted me: “So was that current gf or ex?” I thought it was a terrible joke so I just did the dislike thing you can do on imessage. She texted me a minute later “Well?” I responded it was my current girlfriend and then again she questioned me, asking “you haven’t been talking to ex?” At this point I feel completely baffled at her questioning. I haven’t talked to my ex in over a year and the only reason I did a year or so ago was because she texted me and I asked who it was, when she answered I promptly blocked her and we haven’t spoken since.

I told my mom no i haven’t been talking to my ex and she said I better not have been. I then asked what the point of even bringing her up was to which she said she had her reasons which is a completely unfair response imo when it has to do with myself and her making an accusation like this. My mom has always been unbelievably nosey, ignorant and annoying but this really rubbed me the wrong way and downright pisses me off even thinking about it.

48,"Okay so I don't know where this urge came from of why it came up but I wanna chop all my hair off. Like right now. My own hair cut off with my own scissors by my own hands. And I don't know why. There are many good reasons I shouldn't do it, for example: I am about to be in a musical that will stage in front of a couple thousand people and I would look weird with choppy hair for that, also my Mum and boyfriend would be upset, plus I want long hair for my formal later this year.

But I also really really wanna cut my hair off. I've had long hair ever since I was little. I grew it past my waist and eventually chopped it to shoulder height and donated it to am alopecia foundation. That was a few years ago though and it has grown back to almost the same length. In fact, my plan was to donate again next year as well as take part in the worlds greatest shave.

Yet in this moment I want nothing more than to chop it off. For some reason I connect chopping my hair with starting a new chapter with my recently developed much improved identity. I don't want long hair any more. I want to be free to do what I want when I want to do it. I never have that in my life. I feel like maybe this is the one thing I can have control of. That maybe if I do this, it will push me in the direction of making other changes that are necessary.

49,"Sometimes I love you all, I think of how I'd be lost had I not met any of you. I remember everything we've done together, everything we will do together. And I sometimes cry at just how much I can miss some of you. 

Sometimes I hate all of you. You never have time for just me, I'm always being asked for financial favors, and my every action is kept under a strict microscope created from judgment. I feel like I can't  be myself around you guys and all it helps to make is a growing sense of resentment towards the person I pretend to be. I can't take being the safety deposit box of each and everyone of your secrets. The things I know would ruin this friend group and it torments me knowing that none of you ( truthfully including myself ) are honest towards eachother.

I'm not even sure that any of you are honest to me. I find myself more and more thinking that you all hate me intensely. I don't feel appreciated anymore, my time is constantly being wasted with how much monotony you people produce, and it feels like I can't get anything out to any of you anymore.

Because they always involve the sheer misery I feel being in the position I'm in, where I have zero friends except you so it's either stay with you all or be very very lonely. 

I feel as if I'm not respected anymore, the plans I make consistently fall through, I will set aside time to be with you guys only for you all to decide you have better things to do, and I'm constantly left out of things you guys are doing under the pretense of ""you wouldn't like it"".

I can't take it anymore, we're literally friends because we work at the same place. Outside of that I know you're not the crowd I'd be around. You make me resent myself, I can't make mistakes around any of you ever for fear of endless ridicule. I never thought I'd say it but,

51,"The title says it. Two nights ago, alcohol.. just alcohol has tainted my boyfriends perspective of me and it legitimately (understandably) has him worried for my safety. 

A little background information, this wasn’t the first time alcohol caused a dramatic uproar of emotions that I do not usually adopt, i.e. jealously, rage, depression. These emotions have been inappropriately displaced on my boyfriend of nearly four years. This has happened several times as I reflect back on any major fight we’ve had. Nearly al of them involve me in a drunken state, in which the wrath of me, a different and unrecognizable person emerges, only to cause fights and hurt feelings. Upon waking up the next morning, in a sober and rationale state of mind, I’m completely humiliated realizing that yet again I was the culprit of a huge argument that could have been prevented had I controlled the amount of alcohol I consumed. 

Usually the next morning I recognize the problem and apologize for how irrational I was the night before. Depending on how bad it was, I made promises about limiting myself from alcohol and promising to not allow it to get that bad again. Naturally though, some time elapses and another slip up happens eventually. 

The difference is that this time the line was very clearly crossed. In a desperate and dramatic effort to get attention from him, I told him that one year ago I had suicidal ideations and a plan to carry out these actions. I was referring to a time in which this was a passing thought but, not surprising, I was completely inebriated from alcohol and mid fight with him. After this event I got a counselor to explore what this meant because again, this is not normal behavior from me whatsoever. I thought there must be underlying feelings of depression and anger within me, that drinking exacerbates. Your “true” feelings come out while drinking, right? That’s what they say, anyway. 

I spoke with a licensed therapist for nearly a year trying to diagnose these problems and attempt to help myself. I owed this to myself and to those around me. Talking with a few different therapists made me realize that on a daily basis I don’t have fleeting negative emotions. In fact, I am genuinely happy. I work in a hospital where I am constantly humbled by how lucky I am with my health and my loving support system.  There was one therapist suggested abstinence from alcohol, but that lasted all about 6 days. 

If I don’t drink excessively, this problem doesn’t occur. So I kept making excuses to indulge in a glass of wine after work or hang out casually with a beer in hand. Eventually, as mentioned, enough time elapses and I think everything will be fine if I just have one night out with friends. 6 shots later and probably 5 or 6 drinks later, I don’t know why I’m surprised that I’m back to square one. 

This time, one conversation couldn’t fix or undo what I had said. It scares the shit out of him thinking that this is how I truly feel, or worse that these are actions I might actually take. It’s so incredibly unfair of me to put someone through that. Constant reassurance will not even necessarily convince him that I am actually okay. I’ve tried to beat around the bush, but the truth is drinking is entirely to blame. The person who I despise, only evolves with excessive amounts of alcohol and it’s time that she is put to rest. 

This is to hopefully bring light to the situation that sometimes the worst drugs are the ones legally sold, taxed, and readily available. This is to bring comfort to those going through something similar. Life is a crazy process of growing, changing, evolving and maturing. I want people to have comfort knowing that someone somewhere is probably encountering the same thing, and that we can offer support.

Sometimes a familiar or casual situation like drinking might be okay all your life up until a certain point. Whether your behavior alters due to a change in tolerance, internal factors, or external factors, it’s important to stay mindful and honest of who you are on substances. Be careful to not reach a point of scaring your loved ones and making them question whether or not you are okay. No substance is worth that. 

Im turning over a new leaf. I hate that it took something so dramatic to push me to make serious changes, but it has to happen. I guess that’s why epiphanies like this are known as a “wake up call”",08Jul2019,2
52," 

I have no idea how to even start this story. But I'm gonna try to sum this up as much as I can.

When I was 12-13 I fell into the anti-sjw trap. My parents were both racists and bigots and basically brainwashed me into their agenda. You may think that's an overstatement, but its not. They supported me becoming more and more racist and told me that I was actually 'smart' by looking up conservative news sites and buying into their obviously fake shit. They filled my brain with crackpot conspiracy theories and truly made me believe that western civilization was under attack from the evil shadow-government or Hilary Clinton or whatever.

So I became a raging anti-sjw and dedicated hours to my ant-sjw tumblr blog and looking up conservative websites. I thought Muslims were here to destroy white people, lgbt+ people where crazy and brainwashed by the 'liberal media', Trump was a poor, innocent man under attack by the 'liberal media' and Hilary Clinton and her cronies were going to destroy America if she got elected.

Here's where the borderline-psychopathic shit comes in

I remember making up stupid secret languages because I honestly thought I was gonna save the white race or some bullshit. And my parents fucking supported me. They thought it was greeeeaaaat that I was developing half-baked secret codes to 'save my race'. Another time, I remember getting so fucking angry at myself for not feeling extreme hatred towards Muslims that day like I had every other day. I was scared I was gonna turn liberal because I didn't have a raging hatred for Muslims that day and I looked up biased articles from biased conservative websites about Muslims to make myself hate them more that day.

I also remember fantasizing about devising a plan to buy a ship, stockpile it with guns, sail to Germany and 'get rid of all the Muslims'. I sicken myself when I think back on it. Even my dad at the time said that I was 'fucking crazy' for thinking that while my mom supported it.

My anti-sjw phase started to turn around the day Trump got elected. I remember thinking to myself ""Wow...he actually got elected"" even though my family and I supported him. I just felt numb that day. I feel like a majority of conservatives, including 13 year old me, supported him because he as the edgy, punk president and everyone thought he wouldn't win because that craaaaazy left wing media wouldn't let him.

So after that day, I gradually started to see how idiotic trump was and how stupid I was. I also started to see how abusive my parents where to me and my siblings (one of which ranaway because of my parents).

I'm just ashamed of myself. The only thing I take pride in is that I stopped being racist and bigoted earlier than some other people. But I disgust myself when I think back on all my horrible racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc posts and who I was.",08Jul2019,1

Or I can decide to be here, buy me a car (that I need because mine is about to break) keep working in the unfullfilling work related to my secondary career path, a calm work, with a quiet enviroment, good conditions, low wage, and permanent contract, on a project that I will mostly promote pretty fast since I'm already the head of it.

I've been saving since I started to work, three years ago, to move and do the masters, I had already plans to move there, then germany due to some of my SO needs. It was my goal for years. Then she decided to break the relationship and I was devastated, anxiety some kind of light depression, tried to do the masters last year but I wasn't accepted because I could not start on time, but they said to me to apply next year (this year).

I was on my rock bottom, and I raised, I started doing lots of activities and lot of hiking with a big group of people.I tried lots of things, create more bonds than ever in my life, a few good friends, discovered how beautiful it is my region, how I loved the life here. Last excursion I kinda started getting feelings for some person. So after a year things are going quite right, I even get accepted this time in the masters degree.

But at this point I only want to do the masters because I would like to get that knowledge, but I don't want to move, nor to lose anyone, or lose all the money for nothing more than a knowledge that I will not use in any work. For that I will lose a lot of people and things that right now make me happy enough. But for example I won't be able to access those activities after a year (are limited by age). 

No I'm feeling that if I don't take the step I'm not ambitious, and I'm not willing to sacrifice everything for ""my dreams"" and that probably in the future I will regret the decission. But on the other hand I feel like I am always doing ""what's supossed to do, what's right"" instead of doing what I want, what makes me happy, I will lose everything that right now makes me happy to keep going on with what's right for my future.",08Jul2019,1

In January I had this weird idea to create a YouTube channel (motivated by the loss of a friend from Cancer) to tick items from my own bucket list but also run small projects and help other people to reach their goals and their dreams!

I am really excited because I am launching my first project! I found a guy who is a gifted piano player, writing ng his own original songs and who's dream would be to record an album! However, he does not have the money for it!!!
I decided few months ago to help him ticking this item off his bucket list! And he does not know yet!

I called all the recording studios I found on google and told them about my project to raise funds through his community for this talented and genuine guy in order to finance an album. One of the studio accepted to divide its rates by 3 just for the project!

I released a teaser video yesterday about it and the main video announcing him the news will be released next Sunday.

Today I wake up to him saying ""ewww"" and ""ugly ass looking thing"" and ""dumb bitch"". 


He would never say these kinds of things, however he's always had a great taste in women. Women who constantly say these lines. His baby mama is back in his life and I havent talked to him since the end of last year. So I can only assume it's her. This isn't the first time this has happened.



I'm passive on whoever said this to me. Could be him, if so? Fuck him. Could be her, if so? Fuck em. I'm not too concerned about taking him out of my life.

I'm dumb. I havent done anything or learned anything new in years and now I'm trying to figure out how things work and it's been such a slow process. I cant contribute to a conversation. And it's hard for me to focus on anything.

69,"So, I was walking into town this morning and came across a sad looking bee on the ground crawling in a tiny circle. I immediately started to dig around in my handbag for my bottle of water and something to scoop it up with. 
Before I know it, half the street walks past me forcing me into a state of sheer panic because there are suddenly about 10 people walking towards, past or around me... I freak and try and move out of the way. 
I manage to grab my bottle and a receipt. As I do this, the last guy walks past me and steps on the bee... but not killing it! 
I hurry over to try and help this little guy but as I go to crouch, a woman in a mobility scooter races past, nearly hitting me and runs over the poor bumble bee, sticking it to a wheel. 

I literally just froze. Stood there looking at this empty pavement, where seconds ago this bee was just dehydrated and about to get help. 

I feel ridiculous for being so upset by this but it has really knocked me back. 
I know ""it's just a bee"" but... I can't help but feel slightly responsible for its demise.",08Jul2019,1
70,"So I am in my early 30s, I work as a freelancer at home. I really don't have any IRL friends. I have a plan for my life and I am working towards it, so I am happy about that. But lately I realized I rely too much on other people for my well being and happiness. I actually enjoy my own company, especially when I just sit at a beach with no one else there just me listening to the waves. But when I fall for someone I end up relying on them, which is not great for everyone. Especially when they are being so nice and perfect. 

So I guess what I am asking is, how do you become more self actualized and be more happy with yourself? how do you fill  the gaps? I actually do daily affirmations. I want to feel whole on my own.

78," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

So I’ve always done this. I pick at the skin on my fingers, usually until they bleed. I do it when I’m bored or anxious or worried. It’s super painful, not only when I do it but for a while after because the cut may keep opening, or even if an area didn’t bleed it’s still very raw. 

I do kind of hate that I do this but it’s a compulsion and I can’t stop doing it. I know people watch me do it and think it’s really weird. Or someone will ask what I did to my finger and it’s just awful to tell them I did it myself. I put bandages on usually, to keep me from making it worse. If I’m having a bad time there may be band-aids on four or five of my fingers. It’s so embarrassing. 

My ex used to slap my hand to make me stop, or hold my hand so I couldn’t do it. I always found it so sweet that he cared enough about me to do that. I’ve been single for a while now and i want that again. I don’t know why but I was just sitting in my car, picking st my fingers trying to get myself to stop so I could go inside, and that thought came to my head. “Wouldnt it be nice to have someone who loves me to help me stop this right now?”  

Anyway, I know it’s stupid. But I wanted to write it down and share with someone. Maybe one of you also does this and can let me know I’m not so weird after all.",08Jul2019,0

I fell in love with my partner madly and deeply more than 4 1/2 years ago. Life hasn’t been easy but we have each other’s backs, and we are getting to a more comfortable place with money and work. We haven’t been able to vacation really but do spend almost all our free time together doing things we both enjoy. We managed to get off work for a week so had 9 days together but not enough money to go on a “real” vacation so we did a staycation. It was wonderful. We took the time to do fun day trips we normally don’t do often and just bond with each other. That time together just loving each other and staying away from normal stress helped so much. 

We could have chosen countless times over the last few years to let outside stressors tear us apart and give up on the relationship but we put each other first. When I feel the stress getting to be to much I always make time to reconnect (we both do). I feel so lucky and I will keep choosing him every day.

83,"A lot of people here read [my story](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/c8tlmu/i_am_almost_65_years_old_and_all_alone_in_this/) last week, and a lot of people have since reached out to me. I was very overwhelmed with the attention and had to take a bit of time to settle my mind down, and to process everything I have heard and read. I responded to some of the messages and comments but frankly I was too shocked by the sheer number of responses. I was struck also by how universal that kindness and understanding I was showered with, was. I'm humbled.

I've pretty much packed my bags and left, shortly after I posted my message. By the end of the next day I was on a plane to the Netherlands where the funeral of my best friend Gordon has been held. It's already done by now. And for the first days I was not able to write yet. It was a lot to take in.

The funeral was sad. Just a lot of sad people. I really didn't know what to expect, I haven't been to any funerals before for over thirty years, the last ones were when my grandparents died decades ago. They were in their nineties and their passing was hardly a shock. Gordon was only 63. And he was so healthy up until the moment he died, nobody had seen it coming. I never expected it. I always told myself it was okay not to see him because he'd ""still be there twenty years from now, anyway"". A healthy man in his early retirement, living out his days in a Western European country with excellent healthcare, how could I have predicted he would die in his early sixties? One thing I learned, never take things for granted. Life has a way of taking unexpected turns and leaving you breathless, struggling to comprehend what just happened.

In the Netherlands I met with Gordon's widow and his daughter. He never had more children because of complications during her birth, and his wife later suffered an ectopic pregnancy as well that left her barren. His daughter is now in her early forties, she is a teacher. His daughter remembered me too and that touched my soul because I never had a daughter of my own and now I felt for a moment what it may have been like if I had. She has two teenaged sons, the eldest of whom is his grandfather's spitting image. His widow was... kinder, than I remember her being. Time has taken a lot of the sharper edges off her. She told me Gordon would often speak to her about me. He had a lot of fond memories of me and she was surprised I had never come to visit even once. She didn't seem upset, she just found it curious. She hadn't expected me to come, but was pleased when I did. 

After the funeral, where I felt like an intruder and hardly spoke to anyone, I spent some time in Gordon's house. His family wanted me to stay for a while, which I did. I talked a lot to his widow there. She gave me a framed image of me and my friend, with his daughter on my lap, at a barbeque in his father-in-law's house. He kept that picture on his desk in his study, next to pictures of his wife, daughter and grandsons in various stages of their life. Throughout the years I had remained a part of his life, in a little way. I had been there on his desk every night he worked, read or wrote.

When I left their house I hugged the widow. It's strange how I was the one to initiate the hug, that's a first for me. Hasn't happened before. I just, wrapped my arms around her and held her tight. She wrapped hers around me as well. We cried. We didn't say anything anymore. I think she's a good friend. I think I will write her. Maybe visit again some time. 

Now I am just in the Netherlands. I'm in a place called Delft in a cute little bed and breakfast near a tram station. The host has a beautiful garden. Weather for the past days wasn't perfect but even wandering around places I never been through a bit of rain or drizzle is still very soothing to me. I have cried a lot. I did not connect to many people but just this morning I had a short, spontaneous phone call with Gordon's widow and that was enjoyable. I also had a few little chats with my host. The husband is a retired diplomat and he's an interesting fellow. 

All this may seem unimportant and not very major to most of you reading, and probably very boring to boot but for me this is a big deal and I have done a lot of things lately that have brought me far out of my comfort zone. I am in a strange land, where I know next to no one and yet, I don't feel as out of place somehow as I did before, at home. For now I am resting. Unwinding. Next week I'll tour the Netherlands a bit, the week after I will venture into Belgium for a short while and after that, Germany. 

I have no real itinerary, I'm taking things slow. My money won't run out any time soon and I think I have plenty of time. Worst case scenario, I die on some foreign trip somewhere in a beautiful but gloomy European town, and join Gordon. I'm not even sure if that's even a bad scenario at all. Best case scenario, I live ten or twenty more years and when they put me in a home for the aged, I won't bore whoever looks after me because I can actually entertain them with a story or two. I think I'll try to have an adventure now. Wish me luck.",08Jul2019,1934

As an only child, I just remember ""Annabelle"" was a simple girl that just ran the farm day in and day out with little thought to her future.

I think they actually make some good points. Obviously a lot of that shit is just cruel and ignorant, but I think the idea that gender is something that can be changed is worth questioning. What does it even mean to be transgender? the idea of transsexual is pretty straightforward, regardless of your attitude towards it. It entails attempting to change your physical sexual characteristics as much as possible to resemble the opposite sex, since sex is a purely biological phenomena. Transvestitism is similarly simple, it is simply wanting to wear clothes typically associated with the opposite sex. But gender isn't such a simple thing. Gender is a social construction, an abstract construct relating the various behavioral and psychological norms and stereotypes associated with biological sex. There are certain aspects of this that can never be changed, the experiences of being raised as a woman, being exposed to the bullying and social expectations of a young girl. And unless you have a malformed endocrine system, you have lived with higher levels of testosterone than women, even if it is lower than the average male, and that impacts the way you think and feel whether you like it or not. But going forward you can still change to being a woman right? But what does that even mean? Having long hair and speaking with a squeaky voice? painting your nails and wearing pink? Is that really what you think makes a person a woman? You cling to things like that that are realistically secondary to the experience of womanhood, yet still do things like play videogames and shoot guns and get a computer degree. Now I am not saying that it is essential to womanhood to not be good at math anymore then it is essential to have long hair. I am saying that you aren't moving towards what it really means to be a woman, just towards the caricature you have created of womanhood in your mind, and even at that you still only pick the things that are convenient for you. I'm not sure there even is an essential womanhood that can be moved towards, which is why I am skeptical of the entire concept of 'changing gender'.  It's not a switch that can be flipped. It's a relationship with society, a set of expectations and norms that are often somewhat arbitrary, and none of which alone makes for the essence of womanhood or manhood. It's ephemeral, and in a way doesn't exist at all.


Now here's the thing, if you want to wear earrings and have a pink backpack and all that I won't judge you. You can live your life how you want, and there's nothing wrong with eschewing traditional gender norms. But I feel like this way of framing it is just going to cause yourself and your friends and family undue stress and discomfort. And I think you are looking for a solution to your depression and loneliness in a place that you won't find it. You see womanhood as a golden hill where peace lives, but 3 years from now you'll just be another person, with long hair and female pronouns in a dress, put still just a person like everyone else, regardless of gender. You'll still have to find things to do in your free time, go to work, make small talk, call your parents, buy gas... there's really nothing that special about being a woman, just as there is nothing that special about being a man. Drinking beer and talking about trucks doesn't make one more of a man any more then me not doing that makes me less of a man. Now I won't be saying any of this to you because you're still a decent person and I don't think it's my place to tell you how to live life, and I could be wrong. But I feel like you are letting internet communities tell you what you must do to be happy, and chasing after a mirage of happiness. I know you are desperate for a solution but I am very skeptical that this is it. Still, I hope whatever path you decide to take, you do find peace.",08Jul2019,0

99,"Every time I read a thread on reddit by a guy on this topic, he always mentions that all women are bombarded with male attention. According to these guys, all a woman has to do is exist and hundreds of guys will be fighting for her attention. If she wants a boyfriend, she just has to walk outside and guys will be fighting themselves to date her. Apparently this happens to any woman who is remotely attractive, so if it doesn’t happen to a woman she must be basically deformed. 

As a woman, I don’t get endless amounts of male attention every time I leave the house. In fact I’ve never been approached by a guy, just catcalled. I made tinder and while yes, I did get a lot of matches, a lot of guys are just swiping on everyone and won’t even message you or respond. The rest just want to have sex.

105,"First post here, but a lurker for sometime.

I've been struggling for the past months with a general apathy and lack of will to do something that is not laying on the couch watching TV, browsing social media or staring at a wall. Several circunstances brought me to this spirit (I moved from my country, being on a long distance relationship, being lonely, not able to continue the same hobbies that I had on my home country and not having a group of friends to hang out almost everyday) and I totally lost my strength to do anything. Sometimes just get out of bed is hard. I lost interest in meeting new people or to start hobbies. My work started to be affected by this and it made me lose my confidence. I started to get sloppy, uninterested and anxious. I started crying for no logical reason. 

 I've been doing therapy and talked to some friends back in my country and they all gave me advices and ideas for hobbies. My psychologist also gave me some ideas to get out of this state. I followed some of them but never managed to get any pleasure out of it.

But today I was able to pull myself out of the couch, signed into a gym and managed to exercise for about 1h. It felt great! Im starting to feel that I can pull myself through this and enjoy nice things in life",08Jul2019,1

107,"
(bear in mind, things here may be perfectly normal for an American culture or any similar, but my strict religious western culture actively looks down upon relationships, love, opposite sex touching (even simple holding hands is looked down upon), dating, and all that.)

I always knew that deep down I'm a guy who likes physical affection quite a bit, not sex in particular but hugs, kisses, teasing, getting touchy with my love. But because of my culture portraying that it's bad and wrong I hid them deep inside and never tried showing them up to anyone.
I do, when alone, occasionally browse nudity and porn because I like it. I had fantasies of what I could do with a partner and all that but they were just that, fantasies, because I know that it's close to zero of them ever coming to reality, physical affection of all kind is only allowed/accepted after marriage and even then, girls and general female population here lies on the presumption ""sex is bad, any type of sexual attraction or affection is equally as bad"", as far as I'm concerned and told 90% of the people who do it (after marriage obv), do it in the dark, and only to have kids if they want to. 
It limited me a lot and I simply felt that the only way to actually get what I want is to travel to a more open country, but even then, I'd feel guilty because my culture did draw itself on me enough to make me feel guilty (I watch porn, then feel extremely guilty because of it. Always the same cycle.)


Anyway, I met my partner about a year ago, our relationship has been great emotionally and spiritually, we had the best of the best and enjoyed each other's company. But physical affection isn't one of them, and apparently my partner is the type that (because of culture) never really cared enough to think how would she like physical affection. She never gave it much thought cause it'd be bad. 
But that's not saying she didn't like some thing, like hugging, and holding hands. But we kind of have to do it in private because if we were seen, her guardian could know and simply break our future together (as here, we *need* a consent from a guardian to marry and whatnot, it's obligated by law.) Why? Well, because she's a strict religious western cultured woman that's why. 

So we really have to hide our simple and harmless physical affection cause it would ruin our future (she also doesn't like people judging us, for me? If it wouldn't ruin anything, I don't give a damn to what people think of us as long as we're happy.) 

Overtime, I became more trusting of her, which led me to ""unveil"" my inner self, slowly I would show her my love for physical affection, first via text and whatnot, and then after we get used to it, we'll do it irl in private (like, kissing her cheek, or hugging her deeply, yes, even those are considered ""wrong"" if you're not married.)
One time we got used to talk about kissing, and we were so into the moment we kind of ended up kissing irl, I can't ever tell you how amazing I felt both physically and emotionally, I was incredibly happy and it felt just perfect. Only for, later that day, coincidentally my dad talked about how he saw people kissing in the park (not us) and it disgusted him. It made be feel unbelievably guilty for doing it and enjoying it, but I also felt really angry cause there's literally nothing wrong with kissing! I was in a swirl of emotions and wanted to talk to my gf, only for her to say that she felt super guilty because of the kiss and wanted us to no longer do it until we're ""officially together"". That made me feel all kinds of emotions, relief, but sadness that I'll never get to feel her again. I just started hating my culture more and more.

Overtime, I ended up letting my perverted side slip again and it was a bit stronger than just kissing, basically, boob grab. Once again, we were alone and too into the moment that we ended up kissing, and I ended up touching her breasts. 
This time, I didn't really feel guilty much, I did however feel once again the happiest I can be to finally fill my physical affection needs from the love of my life! Only again, for later, her saying she felt guilty and even if she ""liked it"" she would want to keep it till we are ""officially together"". That bummed me out again, promised to try and never kiss or touch or come as too strong with my desires until it's okay.

Again, more time passed, this time I also let my perverted self show, I knew I'll regret it so I tried to stop, but seeing that this time she was sharing it more with me, and being physically affectionate herself a bit. I took it as a green light, and just, again, with the moment, today we kissed and same thing as before. 
After that we went to work (we work in the same place) and we were caught doing something, apparently, is really bad for our reputation! We were caught ""holding hands"" in our empty room because we had no more work to do and we just were sitting till the shift ends. And were told we can no longer work together in that place. 

Credits due, doing any type of love be it as simple as holding hands, one should always leave relationship affection out of a work place. But I don't know it still seems they made too big of a deal just because we held hands! (We never did anything more in that place, ever.)

So yeah, since my girlfriend really really hates it when someone tells her she did bad, she was sad and felt guilty, super guilty, and told me that. I, in return, felt even more guilty because I indirectly made her feel guilty because I initiated the hand hold (and everything else outside the work place)

So I just, for her sake and our sake, I had to compromise my physical affection needs, I promised to never ever do anything unless it's official. (Married). And to never ever let myself get carried away. 
Even though it's bad, I do really want to have my future with this person, we're so in love with each other and want to be together. I don't want to let her guardian hear anything about it, otherwise she will definitely stop our future.

I just hate this, I really really put a place for physical affection in my heart and having it tear apart 3 times just hurts, even with my partner I can't seem to do what I want, the only solution is being patient and waiting till hopefully assuming everything remains well, we get together and marry.

I don't know, I just want hugs, cheek kisses, holding hands, cuddles.. and yeah other stuff like teasing and boob touching. I just, hate myself for being this perverted person (in my culture at least) that kept making my partner guilty and couldn't stop himself from loving her with physical affection.

I'm sorry I have a need for that.. I just, I never had it from anyone, she is literally the only person I have ever hugged, or heck, she is the only person I ever touched with the intent of love and intimacy. No one else, not even my parents when I was a child.

I'm 21 years old, she's a little younger than 24, our chemistry is perfect and it just puts me sad that she doesn't really give much thought for physical affection as much as I do, and because my culture plants that physical affection is bad and wrong in people.",08Jul2019,0
108,"I feel like I have no reason to feel down most the time like I have been this year my life is better than it was before, but sometimes it just feels like I will never be truly happy again, I want to be able to mean it when I say I'm okay, now when I say I'm okay it means that I'm just down and tired like usual.

I know the people that know in person see the part of me that I want them to see because I feel like I have no reason to complain I have family and friends that care for me and I don't want others to see this side of me, I don't know where I would begin to open up to someone about this.

I have been asked a few times in life why I choose to remain single and to answer that question I usually answer with I don't know, but the truth is I don't fully trust myself during the time of when I was in a abusive situation years ago I found this part of myself as much as I want to think is gone I can never fully convince myself that it is so I stay single to protect others from that side of me being in a relationship and it turning out poorly is my worst fear.

I both look forward to and dread feeling happy the few days I do, I look forward to it because I am reminded of how it feels to be happy, the dread is knowing that it won't last and when it's over it will once again become the feeling of nothingness.

I want to live for all the people that care for me that I care for, I just don't know if I will ever be the same.",08Jul2019,3

110,"First, there’s no equivalent for small or medium sized women like SBW (small beautiful woman) or MBW (medium beautiful woman). So why do you need to use it on heavy chicks? It’s almost like you’re saying they’re not beautiful, which maybe they aren’t everyone finds different things attractive. But that term feels like a tacked together “circle jerk” for heavy chicks to feel beautiful as if the term big right away you think ugly so you have to add the beautiful so they feel good about themselves.

And I feel like it’s only used by people who fetishize obesity. Like if you really find a woman attractive you just call her beautiful. Why do you have to mention that she’s big too? It’s obvious to everyone, you’re not pointing out something we can’t see. So the only purpose it can possibly serve is a labeling too for these thirsty moped dudes who screw them in secrecy because it’s a fetish.

Also, it’s not a flattering acronym, whenever I see it my mind instantly thinks of the term blubber (not fat shaming it’s because of the double B).",08Jul2019,0

115,"I am 15 years old.

My parents have arranged a one week long vacation to France which starts tomorrow. ​ ​I have a severe anxiety problem, which was the cause of me being uncomfortable the last year and a half of school, not attending school the last month of school, and approximately 10 sessions with a psychologist, et cetera. ​ ​But my parents don't believe that I have a severe anxiety problem; they think that I was at the psychologist because I have autism.

I dare not tell them about my problem, for I am ashamed.

They were already told half of it, but they've ignored it since since I've neglected to talk about it. ​ ​They don't believe the severity which I testify. ​ ​They believe that I would feel better if I went on the trip. Let me just add that last time I went on an international trip, I was traumatized, and immediately after the trip, the severity of my anxiety problem rapidly increased. I wonder why.

Actually, didn't I talk about this with the psychologist? Yet my parents don't believe me.

I am very sad. I don't understand how people can expect me to want to talk about my problem. I feel ashamed. Is that not to be expected?​ But you don't believe that it would be better for me to not go on the trip, anyway, so what does it matter?

even if I go to psychologist, I won't want to talk about my problem. then, my parents will get angry and perhaps force me to go on the vacation

I just spoke to my parents for two hours. ​ ​I nearly cried. ​ I fear that my parents will use violence to force me to go on the vacation, and I pray to god that that is illegal here in Sweden.

I will cry, but I don't want to cry.

I described this anxiety problem on another forum, and they told me that I should stay home and seek professional help, because I'm clearly severely suffering.

My parents say that I cannot be alone for 7 days, that I would not survive.

Now, I am sad, because supposedly, I am privileged. How can I stop being privileged.

So, if it is illegal for them to forcibly make me go on the vacation and tomorrow, I manage to gather the strength to not give in to them, I guess I'm the asshole for robbing my brother of this vacation, huh?",08Jul2019,0

117,"TLDR I have moderate/major depression. Most days I kinda just shrug it off since no one likes a Negative Nancy. I just had a glass of wine so loosened up a bit, and after feeling kinda perky for all of half an hour my mind has started to wonder in a bad direction of how I'm a shit human being with no money and no job, and no IRL friends and no romantic prospects. I'm months away from being 30 and my life isn't figured out in the slightest, to the point where everything feels quite futile. It's not even that I don't want to try and make things better but it's so god darn hard to actually get where I need/want to be and by now I could just drop dead and feel like less of a burden to everyone. I don't even want to actively die, it just seems illogical to keep trying when I keep hitting a brick wall as a result of both my own doing and changes in my environment. Days are getting shorter and I feel like I'm getting less done and it's just a circle of torment. I've talked to my doctor and even got referred to a specialist but nothing has materialised from any of that. It sucks because I know I have the potential to do great things and be the person I envision myself being but right now it's just a distant dream that likely will never become reality. I end up being kinda resentful to my loved ones because they're the ones that want me to stick around, so I treat them like shit honestly. Not intentionally by any means, but I could be a lot more loving. I get bad when it comes to my general maintenance too like not showering regularly or brushing my teeth or even just going outside. I used to be more outgoing in my college days but over the years it's all gotten a bit worse and it feels so out of my control now. I don't remember the last time I genuinely felt normal or needed or even just adequate. I don't know what I expect from any of this I just know keeping this all in my head does more harm than good and I don't want the people that know me to know just how bad things really are in my head in fear they'll just wrap me in cotton and pity me. I don't wanna post this in any mental health threads cause I know exactly the type of responses I'll get already.

I mean, I got to the so called ""Kantonsschule"", the highest school after middle school. 

But the day after it, I was pretty sad. Sad, because I won't see many of my friends just casually walking by. Sad, because I won't have as much contact with them as I once had. Sad, because I didn't thank my teacher enough for helping and encouraging me. But I was also happy. Very happy.

123,"Almost a year ago, I met someone who I kinda overlooked for a while. Let’s call him Connor.

Connor, whenever we came across each other, was always pretty charming and polite. He’d tease me more and more as we got closer, and was much sweeter to me compared to the rest of our friend group. I was flattered, but I didn’t really think much of him.

Then for a month he went off the grid and that churn in my stomach became a realization that I was in fact, already smitten with him.

When he came back, Connor acted as though nothing had happened and things seemed to go back to normal. He would light up when he saw me, and acted as though the last month had never happened and him and I were completely, totally the same.

Except it wasn’t because my feelings for him were finalized and I started to reciprocate his advances with a persistence of my own.

And when I did, he started to distance himself from me. His daily messages of good mornings and good nights quickly subsided as I attached myself more and more, and he stopped giving me the “special treatment”.  I was puzzled and hurt, yet figured I could make things right again, whatever that meant.

It got worse after that. My heartache and confusion caused me to grow angrier and angrier, getting mad at him and verbally expressing my feelings on the daily. But he’d always remain calm with a nonchalant attitude and convince me that I was the ridiculous one, and that it was my fault for feeling the way I did - he did nothing wrong except being himself.

There was a time when we went weeks without speaking, until I heard through the grapevine that he missed me and was too scared of hurting me again. I’m not sure, I’ve always questioned to myself what the biggest mistake in our relationship was, and I think that fact that I reached out to him again was the stupidest. I could’ve moved on and escaped the emotional turmoil, but I was caught up in the good memories and the sweet demeanor he had within him. 

We were fine for a while- we would call a lot and hang out, with the occasional argument once in a while. However, at some point I reached the frustration I felt before again, only this time it felt as if we really were over and I would shut him out for good. 

And then he hit me with a bombshell: “this is what you get for falling in love with a sociopath”.

Honestly I don’t remember my reaction. I’m not sure if I was even surprised, as everything clicked into place and his whole calm, nonchalant attitude made sense. He confessed that he watched people and knew how to act around them, and put out the correct feelings a situation called for.

Connor said I could never really understand him, and that I should leave as soon as I could.

I don’t know, maybe it was the fact that I was the only one who knew or that he said he had a soft spot for me, I still stuck by him. We’d go deeper into his depression and existentialism, and read books together and evaluate the possibilities of space, and he would continue to tell me about all his pain and future aspirations that were both bleak but hopeful. 

I fell in love with him, even after his countless rejections. I made time out of my day to spend hours listening to his voice, and checked up on his mental health and eating habits. He would also see how I was doing, and continued to warn me about his behavior and ASPD. But I CHOSE to stick by him and care for him, as if I was living in a delusion that something could happen between us, and everything would be fine even if it was all pretend on his side.

I really do not know why I’m still here. It’s my fault that I’m in a loveless relationship, and that I chose to put up with his indifferent attitude and distant nature. Yet, I feel as if I’m in too deep to leave, and that I’ve given him so much that without him I’ll be lost and lonely. This dependence scares me - I’ve become so afraid of losing Connor, that I’m accustomed to making excuses for why I should still talk to him, and usually apologize for MY frustration and any ill treatment towards him.

So where do we stand today? We still talk everyday, and call as much as we’re able. He asks me philosophical questions, and we argue about controversial topics like abortion, the death penalty, and assisted suicide. On the surface it’s going fine, he makes me happy, and I enjoy every second I’m with him, even all the bad parts. But I don’t know how he feels on his side. He could be using me or having plans to replace me, I can’t tell. All I know is that I’m in so deep, and I love him with a love I know is incapable of being returned back to me.

I wonder what would’ve happened if I never reached out to him after not talking for weeks.

I wonder how much happier I would’ve been today, had I distanced myself after learning about his sociopathy.

I wonder how much future pain I could saved myself from if I just left him right now.

And I wonder if I even matter to him at all.

TL;DR: I am in love with a sociopath, and am too afraid to leave him due to my attachment and hopes that something could happen between us soon.",08Jul2019,1

127,"Sorry if this post is very venting but I just feel so frustrated!!! And wondering if anyone has been in my shoes before. I have been trying to set my foot down in a career path for years with no victory. I graduated college on time with a decent GPA back in 2013. I studied something I'm passionate about: Global Politics. I knew it would be hard to find a job in this field so I made sure I secured good internships. I interned at the United Nations as well as 2 environmental companies.  I studied abroad and learned a language. All this while doing well in classes. I graduated on time and couldn't find anything. But I kept going and didn't sit still. I got a Real Estate License to sell but I didn't like the idea of working on commission. I sold houses and tried to earn well but I always had the goal to find a stable job. I decided the best thing was to go back to school and get a Master's in an ""in demand"" and ""practical"" field. So I majored in Finance. You think it would help right? WRONG...

I spent 3 years in Graduate School while working 2 jobs, graduated with a 3.7 GPA, and applied like crazy during and after graduation. I applied everywhere. 8 months later I got a contract job at KPMG. It was my first chance so I gave it my all, but when the contract ended (I wasn't told when it will end, I was just told that it may extend into a permanent position or it may not) I had to go. 

That was 4 months ago. I just get so angry, each and every one of my friends have found a stable job not to mention is married/engaged. I am the only one who doesn't have these things. This has manifested itself into full-blown depression when I look at my life. Not only do I  not see any professional success but I have not found the right guy either.

You deserve it. Goodnight.",08Jul2019,9
129,"A couple days ag I posted on r/suicidewatch.  I was in a VERY bad situation. Things turned around really fast. I feel like the Reddit Gods gave me a second occasion. Look at my posts for more info. I  just want to thank you reddit community, you are the most amazing guys I've ever talked to. You just turned my life around. God bless the mess that is reddit, It's a source of ideas and deep, emotional talking. THANK GUYS",08Jul2019,1
