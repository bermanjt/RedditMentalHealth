2,"I'm a student in high school right now and I have a ton of problems. Some of my problems are way too hard to even put into words. I don't even know what causes a lot of my anxieties. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I think I'm ranked #2 at my high school, and I have a problem where I hold myself to a fictitious standard that is constantly changing. At first I thought I would just be happy if I was completely average. then I started working really hard in school and now that theres competition and an opportunity for me to be at the top of my class, I hold myself to a standard that is completely impractical. I feel like no matter how well I do in life I will unconsciously constantly be moving the goal post to something that is unattainable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now a lot of my anxiety is focused on what I'll do about college, as im a junior in high school right now. but I'm worried that when I get into the real world this anxiety will shift into how well I do financially compared to others, or how good my relationships are. I know this will make me extremely unhappy in life, but I have no idea how to stop it. I spend a lot of time thinking about what I'll do with my life, but I'm only 16 and I don't know what I'll do. part of the unknown of the future is what scares me, but a lot of it is worrying that I won't be happy because I have no idea how to solve the problems that I have.

3,"This guy in my own discord, brought loads of his friends along and made it really popular. It was a discord mainly focused on Korean Music but still. I loved it, it had all my friends and my buddy made some amazing bots. But this guy, we will call him for reference... Yikes... Yikes ruined everything and made me feel like shit.

Yikes would antagonise me constantly, poke fun, mock my tastes, and I’m not very good on the spot. He knew how to get to me but I didn’t know why. For the first couple months I just accepted it as we were friends SOMETIMES but then I had enough. I went ballistic at him and used what I could, My admin powers. Using this made Yikes use some argument of “Honestly how could you use admin powers” or “Such a nazi mod and controlling I thought this place as free” which I hated. But then that made everyone else agree with him over time.

Then he played this card about mental health. Said how, he was disassociating or something and, I felt bad. So I kept up on him. But then he went straight back to it and kept going on and on and on. And a massive dispute we because I mocked him for something personal. Said “maybe if you listened to ___ insert artist here ____ your life wouldn’t be so bad” and apparently that made people leave and he made my life hell and I refused to apologise for it after all the relentless mocking. 

So tonight I gave in. He relentlessly teased me, pushed my buttons treated me like a child, mocked me, so I kicked him 28 times in total so he knew how it would feel with the relentless bullying. He pinged other members to show what I was doing, and then pinged my buddy. My buddy sided with him.

So, I transferred ownership to him as he was co-owner and left. And blocked and removed friend. With everyone. And I’m sad because that was my server, my little place and, my social area cause I’m not very social irl. And now it’s gone and I’ll probably never get it back and I shouldn’t want it back. Everyone likes that guy, I ban him and I kill it.

I just wanted somewhere to speak. Idc what happens to this post.

6,"My father recently passed after a year of fighting with pancreatic cancer. He was my rock, he was invincible to me. Growing up, he taught me to be strong, and to be a leader and do make every day count. 

I’m the oldest of 3 boys, and thankfully both of my brothers still live at home, so my mother has 2 (22&amp;18) strong men to take care of her. 

2 weeks after the funeral, I am informed that the band I’ve been in (and built from the ground up) for the past 7 years would be moving on without me. This totally came to a surprise to me. They would not give me a straight answer, and when the news broke to our mutual friends and acquaintances, they received the same reason, which was just them talking in circles. They never sat me down to talk about my fathers sickness or how I felt or any of it. 

I’ve become very depressed over the last few months as all of this has been unpacking itself. 

This is by far the most emotional taxing time in my life. I’ve always been on top, mentally. I’ve never dealt with depression or anxiety before and now it’s crippling. I’ve had a few therapy sessions but the days just feel like ALL of my energy is devoted to just keeping my head above water. 

I spend most of my time at home, with my girlfriend. But my mental health has been taking a toll on her as well. I feel like I don’t know who I am anymore, I don’t feel like the same person. 

I know that this is a turning point in my life, a time to become better. 

I try my best to not talk bad about my friends or not to use my father’s death as an excuse, but it’s difficult. I feel like no one understands, and that I can’t talk to anyone about it. 

My plan is to start a business and pick up Muay Thai so I can refocus my goals and my life.

Yesterday I stayed in the library from 10am to 9pm while taking breaks only for meals. I’ve been disrespected my whole life and now I want to be so good no one can help but respect me. Anytime I’m pissed off about how racist people were to me I channel it into work instead of sulking. People dehumanized me growing up. I was on the same level of an insect, less than their pets. I use those memories as motivation. ",04Mar2019,43
8,"I met my friends at university, it’s been 2.5 years since we graduated and we all live far from each other now, but we have a group chat and talk almost every day, just random stuff. 

I consider them some of my best friends. I was new to town when I met them so they were a huge impact on my settling in. I know they all have other individual friendship groups, which are much more important to them. They would each be high up on my list of friends, however I probably wouldn’t reach the top 10 or 20 on each of their lists. 

Our birthdays are all within 2 months of each other, I didn’t hear about any gatherings or parties they might have had but I made sure to message them all happy birthday etc. 

My birthday is the 2nd last in the group. I actually decided to remove my birthday from Facebook to see if they would remember themselves. Well they didn’t. No one messaged or called. But they were messaging in the group chat about other random things. 

Now the next person to have her birthday is two days after mine. Sure enough she is getting lots of love. Good for her, I’m glad so many people care for her. 

I don’t know what to think. I feel so hurt and like I mean nothing to them because how could they remember one girl’s birthday but not mine who is two days before? 

On the other hand, I pretty much asked for it. I removed my birthday so no reminders would come up. I guess I just hoped they would remember on their own. Even some ‘memories’ popped up on fb of my previous birthdays where we were all together, so I thought maybe that would remind them. 

Anyway. I don’t know if I should move on from them or forgive them. Maybe this says more about me than them. 

Thanks for listening.

10,"TL:DR at bottom

I'm a 17 year old junior in the USA and I have a big problem. every one of my friends uses a substance of some sort recreationally and it scares me. recently my senior friends who had never done substances of any kind now get drunk and play video games, it's entertaining to see the aftermath but it concerns me nonetheless.

I have a sophomore friend and a freshman friend one who vapes a lot (freshman) and a sophomore who did vape a lot but I convinced to stop for a while. my problem is that they both find want to continue doing these things because ""we're here for a good time not a long time"" and ""it doesn't hurt me"" which I know is false but they won't listen to me. 

I'm also in a band with some stoners who I don't seem to have any of the same issues with here. their habits don't phase me one bit for some reason. I think it's because I'm not as emotionally invested in them.

I have Vaped once in my life and it made be feel dirty. not because it was a bad vape or bad flavor, but Because I don't like altering myself to look cool. I would drink occasionally by myself (only one or 1 1/2 of an ounce of standard alcohol) every couple of months because that's what I thought you were supposed to do. I don't even really consume caffeine, I drink chai but that's because I like the taste of it.

I knew this was toxic behavior so I stopped. I haven't drank in about 7 months and I do not want to vape again.

all of these people seem to want to have some form or rebellion against something as well which I'm not sure fuels this.

why do I not feel the urge to do these things? am I just a nerd? why do substances make me feel gross? am I just a judgy bitch? 

I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and am medicated for both but I still feel the urge to isolate myself from everything. 

does my straight edgeness make me boring? most people I know think I'm fun and interesting, but I don't know if it's just fake. I feel so isolated from everything now. 

I'm scared for their futures as well as mine and I dont know what to do

TL:DR: all of my friends vape, drink, or smoke but I don't. what do I do? I feel compelled to do but at the same time am also scared for them.

please help me dudes :(

14,"I'm not one to make these kinds of posts, but I need to write this down somewhere to make it real. As small a deal as it may seem to most if not all three of your who will read this. 

It is currently 2:01 at the time of writing this sentence. I have to be up at 7, but I'm just wide awake. I've been going through my recurrent mildly depressive episodes for the past few days. You know, where I'm just sitting behind my computer trying to just forget everything for a minute. I've been having depressive periods since right around my angsty puberty years. And even though I've been steadily improving my life, and the depression has become a lot more manageable, there are always these suppressed thoughts and feelings somewhere in the background.

Well, so tonight after a day of binging video games and Netflix, for some reason, the realisation struck me that the one and only thing that I'm truly afraid of, is growing old alone. I have been subconsciously trying to fill this fear by finding a significant other. Years of failed dating attempts leading me further to despair. Not because no one's attracted to me, but because I'm very picky and don't easily fall for someone. And as I'm nearing thirty, I can never help but feel that I'm missing my window. I don't know exactly what this believe is based on, but I feel that everyone who is amazing enough that I could fall in love with them is going to be in a relationship by now.

I think tonight, I have realised that growing old alone doesn't mean that I need a partner. It means I need friends. I have always been very bad at reaching out to people; to friends. I have a lot of people in my life I'd call friends, but none of them them I'm extremely close with. In a sense that, I don't see them without planning to. I have always been a little jealous (though not in a bad way) of the group of friends my brother has. They're very tight-knit, always in touch, always doing things together. In my case as a strategy for keeping busy, I just tried to have so many friends that even if I only see them once every few weeks, I'd still be able to meet with someone nearly every day of the week. Then it clicked. The reason I need so many friends is because I'm never the one to reach out to meet or do something. I just wait until someone contacts me. So if what I desire is a closer connection to my friends, but am never the one to initiate, why should I expect them to do so?

I have to be the one to reach out. It's difficult for me. I tend to get caught up in my own world and forget about others. But now for the first time in a long time, I have something to move towards. To a version of myself that makes and strengthens connections instead of someone who just takes advantage of the connections others try to make. ",04Mar2019,1

21,"Hello! Alfredo here! And just to sum it up, my aunt took me to a shop where they put harsh chemicals in my hair and the whole entire family was pissed. So, they basically had to continue to put relaxer in my hair so that it won't break or fall off. My mom and dad have basically no idea when it comes to taking care of my real hair so they first had sakima ( don't know whether or not I spelled it right) do it first. First she put the relaxer, washed it out, braided it with conditioner, and washed them again. Then, she blow dried it making my hair obviously straight and cornrowing it. I remember screaming in agony because of how painful it was, and I remember being called a bitch for it. Now it came my step sister to do my hair. She did all of the above, except she flat ironed it, then either did braids or cornrows. Now into age nine, I got a weave. I think I got insulted at by my mother because I couldn't take care of it, but they continued to put weaves and crochets on me. 
I wasn't allowed to wash my hair with a weave or any hair style( I don't know if it's common to even wash it with them...) so I often have dandruff when she takes it out
I won't lie, I used to love having my hair done, but over the course, I got unmotivated. I felt happier with my real hair and I felt that I was changing who I am and what I was meant to be. Sometimes when I imagine myself older, I'm free and bubbly. These hairstyles make me feel fake. And this isn't to bash on women who use relaxers! That's about you, you do you girl! But I'm so done about doing this. They won't and will never listen. I can't let my hair go extinct to the hands of them. I hate feeling this way. AND YES I ADMIT, IM VERY LAZY AND DONT DO ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE. YOU CAN POINT IT OUT AND SAY OH THEN OF COURSE THEY DONT EXPECT YOU TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR HAIR WHEN YOU CANT TAKE CARE OF BASIC THINGS. But here's the thing. I'm dissociating. I genuinely don't feel like myself. It's like two bodies in one and the negative part of me (which is me typing) is in control. I care about Princess( the true me and/or other half) and she agrees shes had enough.
I've done my own research and I've made the conclusion that I want to go natural. I'm sick and tired of having to put chemicals that mess with my hair chemical bonds and weakens my strands. The fact that my hair has been shattered from a very young age and they still continue to put relaxers makes my extremely tearful. They say they put relaxer in my hair because it kills the dandruff. I have a very adamant feeling about that so I'm skeptical. Ive decided that I'm going to cut ALL of my braids off.",04Mar2019,2
22,"I’ve been working at a local publication for close to two years. I was hoping to quit in June, after my official two years, but I feel like the raise gave me a push to quit.
This publication has quite a bit of subscribers in southern Minnesota and I was initially excited to work there. I was ready to be a journalist. It’s been my dream since I was in 5th grade and discovered music journalism. My position in this publication is to do clerk work, plus a few articles a week to cover local theater, art and music (including bigger names, I’ve had the great opportunity to interview Mark McGrath, Michale Graves, Dave Ellefson and Gary Allan.)
They told me since I started I’d make $10 an hour, which whatever. That makes sense, right? They only required 20 hours a week. Plus, I’d have to work every other weekend to work obits. It didn’t seem so terrible at first.
Now a year and a half, they’ve given me more assignments, including writing a weekly column and writing more in the publication’s magazine. It’s a lot of work, but still at $10 an hour. I just graduated from college in May, and as a kid I figured I’d be making more. So I searched for other jobs, including PR.
My immediate boss knew that I was looking for jobs. He even supported me. But this publication treats me like I’m a full time employee (i only work 34 hours a week) including all the other counterparts. 
Last week, they offered me a two dollar raise, but they’ll be cutting my hours, by 4-5 hours a week. So I’ll be making the same, if not less, than I am now.
I’m frustrated. Everyone I talked to, including my mom, said they’d have quit at the moment they talked to me about.
So tomorrow I’m giving my two weeks ... My part time of 6 years — I’ve worked there through my time at this publication — offered me a management position for nearly $15 an hour. And though I’m grateful of this, i am just saddened that i worked so hard to get my degree in journalism to end up working at a fast food joint.

THEN:

I’ve been in a rough patch for a while now. Senior year, my fave teacher left, and the replacement was terrible (got rid of a lot of club traditions, screwed a lot of students over, generally didn’t care). I gave up my position as an officer due to this, and eventually everyone learned I was right about him being a bad guy.
Started college, and have had a deep depression. I’m an artistic student, and I’d love to teach rather than move and “try to get big”, but my nearby school is an engineering school. I’m very anti-STEM because of how I struggled in high school. I’ve been in community college just doing random shit because I’m not sure what to do.
I’ve been distant with family and friends due to all of this.
I think I’ve got a good book idea. With my creativity (and ADHD) I’ve basically built a whole universe full of life and lore. I’ve not tried writing much due to self confidence (also why I haven’t pursued teaching either). I don’t want to be rich, I just people to look at my idea and say...”man, life isn’t that bad”. But I lack the confidence and inspiration.
I’ve dealt with toxic girlfriends all my life, mentally and sometimes physically abusive. I couldn’t find a way out. Even breaking up led to suicidal threats and it was a mess.
I’ve been working a job that gave me no free time, so I was just work and stress. That’s it.

NOW:

I’ve taken a new job. Not the best, but it’s decent pay, and a good schedule.
I’ve slowly been getting back into my interests, which had also improved my drive to get MY story out there.
Despite the fear that my parents might separate...I know that I want to teach the things I’m passionate about, and I’m prepared to go to school. The big joke is that my goal is to take the other guy’s job.
I’m saving money to move out with friends, and making more time for them as well.
I’ve found love with (oddly enough) my ex’s cousin. She treats me amazing, and it’s almost effortless to be happy.

Idk...there’s a lot that still stresses me but recently I’ve had some changes and I just feel like flying honestly!

I have such a strange mix of emotions. I’m of course excited! But I also realize this is a big step for my self-confidence and that’s sort of jarring.

32,"**TLDR:** Hung out with a coworker who I have a major crush on. Got too drunk, memory of the night is pretty blurry. apologized to her the next day for being too drunk, and she was cool about it. But still feel guilty about the whole situation.  
So one of my coworkers(who I have a big crush on and is single) and I had to work late a few days ago regarding an issue that came up but wasn't our fault and had to rely on another company's support. So to pass the time we went to the bar and drank, mostly strong IPAs. I had dinner, but it wasn't a big meal. We were talking about lots of different topics, we're the same age, have a lot in common, I was having a great time.  


We have gotten drunk before in groups with other coworkers. This was the first time I had hung out with her 1 on 1, and she's kept asking to drink more, and I was having such a great time that I kept obliging. For most of the night I thought I was fine, but then suddenly I felt very drunk, like all those beers hit me at once. I usually have a pretty high tolerance when drinking just beer but not that night. The last thing I remember was hugging my coworker good bye(which I'm pretty sure she initiated) and calling an uber home. I don't remember any of the ride but do remember getting home, don't remember going to bed. I remember a lot of conversations about work, but also some personal ones, but I'm sure I forgot a few.   
I woke up the next day with a massive hang over, was relieved to not find vomit(has happened once before) and all my stuff. First thing I checked was my phone, and didn't see anything too weird. I saw my uber receipt, and it said that I had called it at 2 AM! I had no idea we were out that late. I think I may have spilled beer/water on myself at some point because my pants were in my hamper, and I had just washed them.  
I went to work and ran into my coworker, and immediately apologized for being too drunk the night before. She initially had a confused look on her face, and then she laughed it off saying ""no we're good"" and ""yea getting up today was a little rough. thanks for drinking with me"", but didn't really give any details about me. We hung out at a big work function recently, and drank (albeit me very little) and at first I felt like she was avoiding me at first and I didn't really try to go seek her out and talk to her. But then we did run into each other and had normal conversations, she even bought me a drink. I was still thinking about our previous incident and was probably more awkward(my default state of being) than I should've been though.  


When I get really drunk and don't remember things it can go one of two ways, sometimes it's like ""wait you were drunk?"" other times it's been ""yea you were sloppy"", so with my coworker, it could have been either, but I have no idea. I still feel really bad about it, I can't knock this feeling that I did or said something horribly, even though there's a good chance that nothing really happened.  


I think about her constantly, I've always had crushes throughout my life, but this is the first time I've interacted with one fairly often. We don't talk everyday, mostly at work happy hours, but I always find myself looking over in her direction a couple times a day and hope to strike up some conversation when I run into her. I'm in my late 20s but have very limited experience with girls, I've never gotten past a first date because usually I felt like me and the other girl weren't compatible. My coworker is the first girl I can relate to and have a lot of fun hanging out with, though my borderline obsession with her might be unhealthy. I can't help feeling like I screwed things up royally though. Should I talk to her about it more? and apologize again for any wrong doings ?

33,My girlfriend and I broke up on saturday morning at 2 am while we were laying in my bed together. We had been dating for almost two and a half years and I'm fully starting to realize taha it is actually over. I'm writing this purely to vent. As of right now everything that I do feels forced and fake. Even hanging out with my friends last night seemed like a lie. I went to work and went through the motions but it all just feels like I'm in a daze. I don't feel anything and i can't seem to carry on a conversation at all. I know that time will make it better but its really hard to remember that when everything reminds me that she's gone. nothing feels real and i hate myself for it. the one thing in my life that was constant is gone and now it feels like a void is left inside of me and nothing can fill it. I've tried drinking but I don't feel like getting drunk. I don't feel like doing anything. i feel nothing.,04Mar2019,2
35,Currently I am in my second semester of college. I know that usually in college there will be a lot of work given to the students and for my first semester I though I was handling it sort of well. Some nights I would stay up a bit later so I could either finish up some work or just to study for a upcoming test but for the most part did not affect me as much. Recently though I have been feeling the after effects of staying up to finish an essay for my english professor and finishing some test and some homework from my algebra professor (was not the smartest kid in the class during high school and this college I’m attending has a class for students which can help them catch up). For the past week I have felt burnout to the point where I don’t want to do any work. I just finished up some work for my algebra professor just because I know it will effect my grade if I don’t do the work. Was wondering if anyone has some advice to deal/handle burnout from work.,04Mar2019,1

39,"About 5 years ago, I went on a camp with my school. (In the middle of nowhere) The first full day there, on the first activity, I tripped over a tree root and ‘sprained’ my ankle. I was sitting on the ground crying whilst another girl was looking for the teacher (T), she eventually found me and after a while we made it back to the camp site. She had called my mother to ask for permission to give me some painkillers, which my mother of course said yes. Now here come the crazy parts. 
The teacher starts to give me exercises to do for my ankle, rolling it around, moving it side to side and even weight baring (which I struggled with), keep in mind she is not medically trained in any way shape or form, just a primary school teacher. There was one part where I had to get changed for the disco they were having, I hopped to my cabin (with the help of my friends) and back to the table that was sitting out side. I felt really proud of myself, and I told the teacher about my accomplishment in which she immediately shut down saying I should’ve walked. 
The next day, I wake up and the teacher is there, she asks I feel any better, which I didn’t, so I replied no. She then said she was going to call my mother to come pick me up. 
This place is 3 and a half hour drive away from where I live so I knew it was going to be a while. My mum finally arrives, and we set off back home, (stopping at McDonald’s for a quick bite to eat.) We get home, make an appointment for the doctor and set off. The doctor takes a look, say that it could be possibly be broken but the X-ray place is closed so we will have to wait until tomorrow, but we will put a backing cast (half a cast that goes on the back of the leg that is held on with bandages) 
Next day I get an X-ray, they aren’t quite sure if it’s broken, I need a CT scan. I get that done, My ankle was broken in three places, through the growth plate. After that, it’s now Friday, the rest of my grade get back from camp. We go there to welcome them back, my mum is talking to the teacher, the convo goes something like this: 
(M = mum, T = teacher)
T: Hey, how’s Caitlin’s leg? 
M: It’s broken in 3 places, she needs to go to hospital tonight.
T: Oh, ok (walks off) 

That night, I go to the hospital, I get a proper cast put on, get an X-ray to see if all is in place, which it isn’t. I have to be put to sleep so they can get a thigh high cast on my leg (which is bright pink) Im in the hospital for a total of 3 days. Most of the costs were covered by insurance so it wasn’t a huge cost for us, but we had to buy crutches and rent a wheelchair for me. 
Once my cast came off (7 weeks later) I had learnt how to walk again, but I would still limp around the place. The teacher came up to me and had the audacity to try and tell me how to walk properly. Needless to say, I didn’t listen to her and continued on my way. 
The teacher still has yet to admit her mistake and apologise, and won’t even talk to me (not that I’m complaining) 
I asked my mum about it a couple years later, and turns out that the teacher should’ve called an ambulance, her excuse being there weren’t enough staff( there were plenty). We ended up suing the department of education, we received $1000 which was put into my savings account. 
My leg has healed up nicely but I definitely won’t be going back to the campsite of talking to that teacher ever again. ",04Mar2019,2

42,"My whole life I’ve always found it extremely difficult to cry. I would hear about something terrible, and I would feel very sad about it, but I was never able to shed any tears about it. On average, I go 6 months to a year without crying. I know I have a problem with showing any emotion around others. I feel uncomfortable saying “I love you” to my mom. I do love my mom, but I feel so awfully uncomfortable saying so. I always have. But I’m not uncomfortable expressing emotion when I’m alone or when I’m online. But when I’m alone I can’t cry either. I don’t feel emasculated or ashamed about crying, I just.. don’t know how. I physically do not know how to get tears out of my eyes when I should. 

I’ve been through some pretty bad shit and I haven’t been able to cry about it. I was raised in Mormonism, and it fucked me up. It still does since I still live with my family and have to pretend I believe. I was sexually abused by my brother when I was young and it fucked me up. I’m in the closet as bi and trans (ftm) with unsupportive parents and it still fucks me up. The shit I’ve been through hasn’t turned me into a more emotional and caring person, it’s turned me into an asshole. It seems that the only emotion I can easily express is anger. I’m so fucking angry and judgemental. I snap at people, mostly my family members, all the time. I’ve never been violent or anything, I just say a bunch of shit I end up regretting. I’m extremely sleep deprived. Every day before school I have to go to before-school church, which means leaving the house at 5:30 AM. It’s crazy as shit. And I’m so fucking angry about it constantly. My sleep deprivation is definitely one of the major contributors to my anger. I can’t easily express other emotions, but I don’t even know how to begin to control my anger.

I don’t feel like I’m bottling up emotions though. I mean, I probably am, but I don’t feel emotions piling up or anything. I have a condition called maladaptive daydreaming, where I daydream to an extreme. I’ll be pacing around my room listening to music and daydreaming for hours a day. I can’t stop. It makes me dissociate from the fucked up shit in my life. I wish I could stop but it’s an addiction at this point. It does relieve negative emotions. And when I try to stop I usually have a mental breakdown in a few days. This mental breakdown consists of pretty much a 24/7 angry panic attack, and eventually I go back to unhealthy amounts of daydream because it stops the anxiety.

One time I was in math class and out of literally nowhere I just started crying my eyes out. Idek why. I just covered my face in my hat and stayed like that the whole hour. I’m pretty sure I wasn’t fooling anyone though. It’s the only time besides maybe kindergarten where I’ve ever cried in front of my peers.

Today I’m up at 1 AM because I was reading this thread on r/ftm about “how did you find out you were trans”, and I just remembered how I had that realization a few years ago and I got all sad because I was remembering how confused, alone, and dysphoric I had felt my entire life leading up to that point, and my pathetic stage of denial I had. I’m just hella sad. I feel like I’m about to cry. But I cannot get any tears out. I’ve been trying, but I just can’t. Idk how.",04Mar2019,0

46,"Hey guys,

I know you all don't really know me, which would make it difficult to really speak to any efficacy, but I figured let's post here anyway.

When I was in highschool (24 years old now, 25 in July) I went through the works of bullying and being called creepy, etc, etc. Nothing severe, just enough to upset the common folk who experience it. I will admit, I did bring alot of it onto myself, mainly because I didn't have the greatest social upbringing and didn't jive appropriately in social situations.

I'm all grown up now and live in an apartment just a short drive from downtown Toronto, Canada.

Now that I've grown up I often try to figure out why every once in a while, some random people will look at me and will appear to be judging me or I will get the feeling that they assume I am ""weird"", maybe I am, but I just don't understand what about me causes this reaction.

Not a huge population of people do this, however. I also get the people staring at me for whatever reason; sometimes in a normal way, sometimes in a kind of strange way like I'm doing something odd, but when you live in a big city - I suppose that's regular day to day life.

For the longest time, I've always thought I had a mild case of social anxiety, but tonight after reading about it – I discovered that I don't really fit the definition. I don't get nervous talking to men or women (only with women if I have feelings for them, in my opinion, is normal); I don't stick to a very tight group of friends and close family to avoid interacting with others. I have no problem having a conversation unless it gets to the point where I don't know what to say (I kind of stall at that point).

Having said all that, I don't agree that it could be caused by social anxiety. I also sometimes just believe that I'm overthinking it all.

Do any of you fine people have any thoughts on the matter?

Thanks in advance :D",04Mar2019,2
47,"Last week I met the most amazing girl ever. She's nearly perfect. Deep connection, really supporting and motivating, beautiful outside and most importantly inside. Anyway. Yesterday she was getting a bit affectionate to me, and while it was really nice, she may have unexpectedly come a bit too strong. 

&amp;#x200B;

What happened was, that since she told me I'm very attractive (I don't think I am that attractive) and she really enjoys my company, something changed in me. I started seeing her as ""less attractive"",when I had spent 5 hours with her on Sat, totally giddy of being with her. My gut feeling is telling me something is not right. I tried breaking down what I'm feeling and none of them are really deal breakers. (One of them was the way she currently has her hair, easily changeable, currently this way due to a hairdressing mistake, and that she talks quite a lot, but so far I enjoy listening to her and she is also a good listener. As said, no deal breakers).

&amp;#x200B;

I did some introspection and realized that I have a problem. Or problems. Every girl I dated, I find her hot until she shows a lot of interest in me, then I lose interest. Its like I only want the chasing thrill. I also understand that physical beauty is passing, and I should focus on a connection, like I feel so far with this girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, even if things don't work out with this girl, though I really like her, I think I am going to book an appointment with a therapist. Some people that have issues similar to mine said that this comes from low self esteem. I think I do have low self esteem, and that I seek a lot of validation from people.

This is not going to be easy..

48,"Hi all. I don't know where else to put this, but wanted to know if other people had experiences like this. To make it short, I have kind of bad FOBO (fear of better options). For people that don't know what that is, it's the idea that every decision can be maximized, i.e. it is possible for the perfect decision to be made every time you are faced with making a decision. [Here's an article that goes into what FOBO is.](https://medium.com/swlh/fobo-fear-of-better-options-is-the-reason-you-cant-make-a-decision-294fb91c18f4) I'm a huge perfectionist, and come from an immigrant background often marked by achievements, wealth, and career advancement. It's probably where my FOBO comes from. But I think this intense FOBO is stopping me from not just being satisfied with my life and finding contentment, but also stopping me from being engaged with whatever's in front of me and being in the moment.  

I care a lot about art and its transformative power, and still have dreams of being a writer. But for a while now, my FOBO has made me totally unable to focus on a movie, book, or any art if it doesn't engage me within the first 15 minutes. I find myself constantly distracted because I just have this gnawing anxiety and keep thinking, ""man I could be watching or reading or doing something better right now, that might be even more valuable to me."" FOBO stops me from being absorbed in anything at all, and takes away all my patience. It doesn't matter whether it's an action movie, a slow movie, a fantasy novel or a literary novel; almost every time, I can't get absorbed in anything because my mind is so dang distracted all the time.

The only thing I can say I'm absorbed with, with 100% certainty, is video games, and that's only because of their purposely addictive qualities like bigger and bigger numbers, flashy animations, etc. Now I have nothing against video games and I still love them to death, but there are things that I care deeply about and that I want to spend more time on.  

I just want to spend less time being anxious about always trying to maximize my time. I want to stop thinking about life ""progress"" and stop obsessing over hitting the absurdly high benchmarks I've set for myself :( Can't I just freakin' enjoy things for the sake of enjoying them?!!??! UGH. 

Anyone have a similar personality, and has anyone overcome this? ",04Mar2019,2
50,"A lot of people battling with addiction tend to post pictures of themselves throwing away whatever drug they’re taking, whether it be cigarettes in the garbage or pills down the toilet.

For some reason I’ve always thought this is kind of a cop out. I understand it can feel relieving to let go of drugs in this manner, but how can people find pride in throwing away or removing access to such drugs?

In my opinion, defeating an addiction is about establishing dominion over whatever it is you’re addicted to. I feel as though it is much more respectable to demonstrate willpower by denying or avoiding use of the drugs when they are within easy access to you. 

To elaborate a bit more: if you throw away cigarettes, you’re eliminating the possibility that you can smoke them. But is it truly conquering that addiction? I feel as though there is no greater method of truly conquering addiction than proving to yourself that you can abstain from whatever drug you’re addicted to, even if they are within easy access. Because that gives you two options: take the drug therefore you fail to conquer your addiction, or you resist it and establish that dominance.

Whereas with the latter option, you only have one outcome: you can’t take the drugs because they’re no longer within access to you.

I am hoping to start a discussion on this and hear what people think. I am sure there are many people out there that would disagree with me. ",04Mar2019,2

When I get back nothing sounds fun except sleep. I sit in bed and if I cant sleep I think. I'm 19 and I feel like I've thrown a lot away... past relationships that ended because of me, choices I made that I regret, and even things that I know weren't my fault but I feel bad about them regardless. In particular, that girl who I still have feelings for but dont know if I should say anything. Things didnt work out the first time around, and I'm fairly sure she's over it, but we're still friends. I'm scared if I bring it up I'll never talk to her again. All of my friends give me shit for not getting being over her, but I just cant stop thinking about it. I wish I could just shut these feelings off, but I can't. I feel like a piece of shit because I dont want to be that creepy guy who cant take a hint the first time around. I just keep these feelings to myself. I'm getting older but I feel like I'm wasting my potential. Dating's never been a huge priority on my list and now I feel like I'm even further behind the curve because I'm hung up on this girl. I hate myself, but all I can do is keep tugging along.

68,"So, yeah. I'm an attractive guy and have caught girls checking me out , complimenting me. The thing is , I have been on NoFap for &gt;50 days now , and well, I feel aggression with too much intensity over really petty things. It's just my frustration from life trying to get a release. I know , deep down  I am scared and soft , but now , very often I feel like a psychopath and the burst of anger is too much to control , and it's made me gain some respect (cos I avoid bullshit most of the time  now) but I guess people are scared of me, and that's impacting my intrapersonal relationships. We bros often roast each other , but now , I take it too seriously and personally , when I'm laughed at , and feel a surge of emotions, that tell me to fucking rip that guy off. Okay, I guess I need help. Also , these episodes of anger are interspersed with gloomy days ,  where I am very vulnerable. The thing that hits me the most , is that girls of my college, really often ignore me, and often overlook me in conversations. And that shit gets to me so fucking much , that , I just wanna flip them off, and shout at them , or just fucking cut my dick off. Yeah , infatuation is my worst enemy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also am told that I have a resting bitch face , and that makes me look I'm so angry , and makes men go into the defensive. Deep down , I really want to reach out to them , or talk to them , but whenever I try to get into a converstion with a girl (in group scenario) I'm often ignored by them , and it sucks. In solitude, girls talk good to me, but in groups or shit , they talk to happier guys , and the worst thing is , I just wanna never  talk to any girl of my college (for any purpose) which is actually really impossible. , for me , at least(I'm in the student council).

&amp;#x200B;

The first sem , saw me crying and just emotionally dying from a really toxic/narcissist roommate, who still spreads lies about me. I really want to kill him. But , I just cannot man up to him, and I feel dominated by him , while he treats me like shit. This sem , I went from cheerful to happy to lonely to happy to depressed and now angry. I do chase girls, and there's probably a girl I like , who likes me back , may be , but I've heard things about her , that just stop me(She lead someone on). I  rarely ever talk to her irl and she never texts me first/ shitty confusing signals. That;s something that's eating me up to. I feel I have to play games with her to retain her interest in me, and that;s all in my mind, but that;s how it is.

I don't know what to do anymore. I dress well , look clean , and am confident somewhat, Still I don;t think there are any fish in the sea for me.

I have my brother but he's abroad in college and is going through some rough stuff rn. I go for therapy and take meds bc i have some mild OCD issues and I self harm as a result sometimes. Basically a very close friend of mine started hating me and I was hurt but fine with that bc I didn't like him much either as he continuously put me down.

Not only that, she said that we should stop talking because I caused her to develop anxiety and sleeping issues. She also told another friend who I've known for half my life that I said some bad things about him.and despite me sending screenshots of wherever I had mentioned him(which cleared my name), he teamed up with one of his friends and they both just started badgering me in school. I have 0 friends now and I apparently caused someone to develop anxiety issues! I don't know what to do. I can't be alone anymore. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I recently got my guitar cover noticed by an ex guitarist of Guns N Roses on IG(Bumblefoot), but I don't even care. I just want to have someone. I want to be loved.

73,"Hi reddit, (TLDR on bottom)

I'm just lost on how to proceed here. My gf has a really shitty ex ""best"" friend. 

Story: 

Her ex best friend, let's call her Maria. All of us are 22 years old, just grad college.

&amp;#x200B;

Maria is a hard headed b\*\*\*\*. Whenever her and my gf woudl get into arguments, Maria would know that gf is very soft and kind and let her feel bad about things that weren't even her fault. (gf would basically get annoyed at Maria and maria would turn it around on her, exploiting mental weakness).

&amp;#x200B;

Maria got a job at company X with her mom's help. Gf applied to company X a month later and Maria straight up asks: ""why are you trying to steal my thunder"". Gf is really upset.

Then, Gf gets job at prestigious company Y, by herself, no recommendations. Maria says ""i bet it was easy for you since you go to a college that has a lot of dumb people"" (my gf is very intelligent and hardworking, but transferred from a prestigious college due to external factors, and Maria KNOWS this).

There are a lot more stories but BASICALLY my Gf has cut off Maria 9 months ago. Since then Maria has been ""sweetly"" trying to become friends with gf again. For lack of better words, every time they have an interaction, she asks for help/recommendation to get into gfs prestigious company Y. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Gf is very nice and wishes the best for everyone. She feels extremely guilty for not recommending Maria. Maria knows this so she's been (for lack of better words) honeydicking my gf over and over and over to get her to break and submit a recommendation. Being VERY pushy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Gf feels terrible, and cries when this happens. She doesn't want to be a bad person. I dont know how to help, every logical reason shows that Maria is using her for this recommendation, and that some smarter, kinder stranger deserves this position over Maria. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I would REALLY love advice to tell my gf she's not a bad person**. To be straightforward, I do not want Maria to get this recommendation. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm fed up and just want her to recommend Maria so she and I can have mental peace. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please give some advice I can relay to her. She listens to emotion and not logic. 

Thanks in advance.

\*sorry for the grammar, I have to get back to work so I typed this as quickly as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: 

Gf's ex best friend is a b\*\*\*\* and wants a recommendation for a prestigious company that gf got into. Ex best friend is exploiting my gf's emotional weaknesses to force her to give a recommendation. soft and kind Gf feels extremely guilty for not helping someone when they ask. Ex best friend is only reaching out to gf and acting like friends to get recommendation. I need advice on how to tell my gf she's not a bad person for not recommending ex best friend.

75,"When I was in 6th grade, a friend of mine passed away unexpectedly after a fairly routine but serious surgery (scoliosis correction) at age 14. I missed school the first day to grieve, so my teachers knew about what had happened. Maybe a week later, I was in homeroom and the school-wide ""morning news"" was on. A segment came on that was related to surgery (honestly, I hardly remember because I never paid attention to it anyway) and my homeroom teacher got a phone call. It was Mr. Miller, saying that he needed me to come to his classroom. I walked over and he met me in the hall with one of his students, another friend of mine. He had her sit in the hallway with me to keep me company until the segment ended. She probably had no idea what was going on because I hadn't told my friends about what I was going through, but she kept me distracted nonetheless. 

This was nearly 15 years ago and I'm still tearing up thinking about how thoughtful and kind this simple act was. Unfortunately that was his last year at my school and he has an extremely common name, so I haven't been able to contact him.

87,"I feel like having similar interests/hobbies/preferences/experiences to other people is desirable within society. It's easier to foster connections and have conversations with those who are similar to you. You might feel more comfortable joining a group of similar people, and feel included.

&amp;#x200B;

But why does it bother me? When I search up a song that holds a lot of meaning to me, I feel weird when I see the thousands of comments praising the artist. When I read through articles and posts detailing people's struggles, perhaps with school or mental issues, I also feel a little weird. When I see someone who claims to have a ""unique"" sense of style, I can't help but think about the thousands of other people I've seen who look the same way.

&amp;#x200B;

I by no means think I am a ""special snowflake"" of any kind, nor do I strongly believe that every person is radically different from another. I do understand that most people are not exactly the same, and that isn't exactly realistic to think that people should be more different from each other, especially with how information is now so quickly spread and far-reaching. I guess being able to find people with similar personalities and traits anywhere kind of gets to me, and I don't know why. I know that talk of stereotypes can be sometimes frowned down upon, but I seem to find that just looking at a person can tell me what thoughts and opinions they have (which I often find to be accurate). It's weird to be able to find people who are near carbon copies of each other, or to a lesser extent be able to find similar ""variations"" of people that exist.

It's a really long post. I do apologize.

&amp;#x200B;

What you did this weekend, to your own art and creation. I want you to know that what you've done is quite possibly the most gracious and generous thing a person can do in their life. Too many people in this world today, don't care enough to give a damn about anyone else. So many other people would have just laughed at the notion of their art being turned into something problematic. So many others would scream censorship and campaign against having anything to do with it.

&amp;#x200B;

But you didn't. You saw what was happening, how your art was being used and actually did the one thing no one else could do. No matter how hard it must of been. I know from personal experience what it is to lift such a ""curse"" as you put it.

&amp;#x200B;

I became a huge fan of your work, when Mother Bird first went viral. Before she was used by terrible people to terrify an entire planet of small children. That's how I discovered the rest of your work. Brilliant BTW. Anyway, and I wish I could say this to you instead of the internet, I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT'S LIKE TO CREATE SOMETHING, FIND THAT IT IS AFFECTING PEOPLE BADLY AND THEN AS SUCH, HAVING TO DESTROY IT.

&amp;#x200B;

Much like your Mother Bird, my song will never fully disappear from the internet. Despite my best efforts. The day my nephew was born I was in a studio recording music. Spur of the moment I got what I can only describe as divine inspiration. Whole song just suddenly in my mind. Lyrics, instrumentation. I dropped the project we were working and a set to recording what I was hearing in my head so I wouldn't lose it.

&amp;#x200B;

The song was about a boy named (name is changed for privacy reasons) Corey. The song was more ballad than song. It was a story. In this story Corey has a hard life. When he turns 18 he basically just snaps and shoots up a bunch of people. The song is the story of how he gets caught. It was epic. it was amazing. It addressed a brand new social hazard in the United States in the late '90s. The song was written in 1999.  Well, as soon as our feverished recording session ended my sister called to let me know she had the baby and everything was fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything was fine except for what happened when she went to write his name on the birth certificate. She wanted to name him after Bach, but the woman in the next room used the same name. At the last minute she chose the name Corey. We had JUST finished recording. My heart dropped into my intestines.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite my best efforts, the song was never fully deleted in it's entirety. To this day 2 decades after the fact I am still finding copies in old saved files and original dat versions in storage. I burned and continue to burn any version, any mention.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the year Corey started high school. Last Friday my sister brought him to my house so we could go out to dinner. This is rare so I knew something was up. She does this without fail, when she doesn't know to handle a situation regarding her kids and the schools. I'm the scary one. I'm the one that won't put up with shit. I'm also listed as THE legal guardian when she is not available (ie stuck at work), so like I said. I'm the one that ultimately has to sit down with administrators/social services/police when this sort of thing happens. LPT- public schools and social services will leave you alone after the first time you brew up a big stink. Never take shit at face value and ALWAYS have your kids back in public. Home is where you should be disciplining. Disciplining does not mean beating, berating or abusing.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out the kids at his school are bullying him. Which we expected honestly. He is VERY small for his age right now and he's on the spectrum. Middle School was struggle. Despite him being on the spectrum the child is BRILLIANT. Just not so much socially. Well, older boys started mocking him and calling him a school shooter. The kids were so loud the rest of the school chimed in. Damn near the entire school in the cafeteria before school started. Just chanting ""Corey is a school shooter"" Everyone was laughing at him while the teachers and the principals called the police and had my nephew arrested. Because apparently the people teaching our children don't know how to exercise any amount of common fucking sense. Cops arrested him and showed up at my sisters demanding a search. Without a warrant and based on probable cause. 

&amp;#x200B;

They found nothing, because no one in this family owns any kind of gun and Corey is 13. His biggest concerns are video games and sushi. All he wants are friends and to be accepted. All he gets is harassed and made fun of.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway my point is. I know how much it sucks to see your art turned into something nefarious. I know that it's even harder to destroy a thing we've worked so hard on. You made a sacrifice for the benefit of total strangers and I applaud you for it. I just wanted to let you know you are not alone, what you did is amazing and inspiring and that if things get worse or if the internet continues to use your images? Don't be discouraged.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not your fault. YOU BROKE THE CURSE for millions of children around the globe. Someone else wants to use your work as they find it online? You sue their asses. Or the platform that allowed the media in the first place. You did not do this. Your art is amazing. Scary or otherwise. I never found Mother Bird all that scary. She looks like what I think an actual Harpy would look like. 

&amp;#x200B;

THANK YOU FOR YOUR SACRIFICE and THANK YOU FOR TAKING A STAND.

&amp;#x200B;

Can not wait to see your next work. Please don't let this discourage you.

I never could quite handle the joshing around in polytechnic. Above all, what I couldn’t stand was the expectation that I play along. The group that mocked me at every turn decided it would be fun to be especially nice to me when tutors and lecturers were around. One member of this group is studying to be a doctor! What a fine doctor he will be! 

I should let it go. I ought to. I’ve tried to reimagine all my classmates as having been nice, kind to me based off my uneducated understanding of a scientific text that suggested memory is malleable. It’s not much use.

Going to Australia had been one of the few solutions. If someone like him could not get through it, what’s to say an unambiguously inferior creature like myself could?

One pro-euthanasia activist posited that having the means to end your life allows you to live longer because the knowledge that you have an out the moment you can’t continue living, is reassuring, calming. That was where I was.
