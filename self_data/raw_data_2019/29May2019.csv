1,"There's this guy and we just clicked so fast and we're dating since 5 freaking days and I already imagine wayyyyy too much stuff with him

Like omg we clicked so well and he treats me so well and we promised ourselves we were gonna take our time bc we both ruined relationships by going into it too fast but aaaaaaaah

He's so cute and nice and pretty and he's bi like me and despite the relationship being heteropassing we're definitely very gay together and it feels so good to date someone who understands bi erasure and biphobia

We communicate so well, it's night and day with my awful ex-relationship

I don't wanna say I love him but as the fucking artichoke heart I am I kinda sorta almost already love him. Not really, just almost, but still

Idk it's just the way he looks at me or the way he compliments me or idk. It feels so natural, not at all in a flirty or artificial way, just him opening up

5,"A few years back I started posting naked pictures of my junk and face online. I am a male by the way. I was not getting the attention I wanted from women sexually, and I had been curious about guys (I identify as straight, with curious tendencies) and decided to start posting nude selfies and sexual things online. I deleted them after a bit but a few got on to other site. I have been able to delete most of the pictures of myself and hope to get the rest deleted ASAP, since I have found a few more. But when I search my old usernames other pictures show up. Now my full name is not attached to any of these, but someone posted my first name on some pictures back in the day so I know no one can search for my pics by  
full name, but I hate myself for what I did and worry every day they could ruin my career. They are hard to find unless you know the usernames I posted under and I am going to try and get them removed from as many of the sites as I can.

Should I worry that these could end me? I can’t get over this stupid, stupid decision I’ve made in the past. I get that we all make mistakes, but I can’t forgive or forget this one of mine since others have reposted these images(mostly on random sites that no one probably goes on, but still).

I recently had someone I used to talk (2 years ago...) to on an app find an old texting app username of mine that I never gave out and I am worried about what he may do. He just messaged me saying hey but I didnt open it. It can sort of give away my full name though, and I feel like he may know me personally. I wanted to delete the account but that may give it away... he just messaged me again as of 3 days ago...

I am sorry for the wall of text but I need help here on what to do. I am going to reach out to google to help me make the pics harder to find(they remove them from their search engine, but any other advice will help too.",29May2019,1

Throwaway.

I was at the beach this weekend and I ran into Martin, my little brother's chubby geeky friend. My brother sold him his Playstation 4 to buy a Nintendo Switch. Martin told him he would pay him back the next week. That was 2 month's ago.

Running into him on the beach, I bumped into him and his geeky Ninja Turtles shirt and lime-green bathing suit. I asked when he's paying back my brother, as I towered over him (I'm a 6 foot tall rugby player, he's a 5'6 nerd.) ""I'll get it when I get it.""

I always hated that geek's condescending fucking tone. I told him to give me something for collateral, at least.

He said ""I don't have any collateral, you chubby bitch.""

I was furious. But then I realized, oh, he does actually have collateral.

And 3 minutes later, he was frantically running across the beach back to his house 2 blocks away.

And I was walking off with a Ninja Turtles shirt, flip-flops and a lime-green bathing suit.",29May2019,0

16,"I haven't felt any strong emotions in a while. Most of the time, I feel low. I force myself to keep doing things, like eat food and go to the gym. But I myself have no emotions.

A long time back I kinda brainwashed myself into believing that I have no emotions. I shouldn't have done that but I did. 

Now that I'm trying to get a social life, I can't. I cannot connect with people. I can't read what people feel. I cannot sense the vibes in a room. 

Sometimes I try hard and I feel a bit good. I feel like I have normal emotions now and then it all comes crashing down. 

It's very hard to not go back to my emotionless state because if I do go back, then this emptiness will go away.

I'm quite confused. My friends are really nice to each other but anytime I open my mouth they yell at me. It's not just them but literally every person I've met. Everyone is kind to me because I help people a lot. I think I'm a decent human but not a person to be friends with.

Even when I'm surrounded by lots of people, I still feel lonely.

I've talked to a therapist a long while back and she  said she can't do anything for my emotionless state. I can't afford to go to another counsellor. 

She's put my name in for cognitive therapy. I hope that does something for me. I genuinely don't know how to get my emotions back. I want to not be a sociopath.

24,"I need advice on how to live with the guilt 

I’m using this account as I don’t want, in any way shape or form, to link the story to myself or identify my friend.

I attend university in America; and I met some great people in my university halls. People of all cultures; from all over the country, and I knew I was going to have an amazing time.

I connected with everyone, but I had a close relationship with a fellow male in the halls. We both shared the same interests and we always laughed and joked with one another.

Two months past and I notice he had scars on his forearm, but more importantly that there were some fresh scars beginning to show. I didn’t want to confront him as I was worried it would make him feel like he was backed into a corner. I subtly stated that I’m always here for him, without talking about the scars, and he acknowledged the generosity.

Fast forward a week and he becomes very secluded, and isolated himself in his room. The rest of the halls would be in the social space drinking, and his face wasn’t appearing. I’d ask him if he wanted to but he’d always make up excuses and say he was tired, or that he was busy. I thought nothing of it.

A few weeks later and he began asking me if I wanted to do activities with him, and if I wanted to chill in his room and watch films. I was feeling a bit tied down with university work and also I love me time, so I declined the offer. Little did I know this was him crying out for help...

The next night I’m lay in bed by myself, and I hear a commotion in the room next door. I walk out, using the toilet as an excuse to have a nosy and I noticed that I was hearing heavy breathing. I walked into my friends room and there was blood every where. Blood on the floor, blood all down his arm and blood on himself. He was slumped on the floor, crying and I made direct eye contact with the blade. I knew he was in trouble.

I rushed over and applied pressure, whilst comforting him. I was telling him that everything was going to be okay, and that help is on the way. Unknown to him I began to panic, I knew we were in a situation that is looking like it won’t have a happy ending, and I silently wept - but kept a positive attitude so I wouldn’t scare him. He placed his hand on my hand, rubbed it and said “I’m sorry”. It was at this moment I knew how serious his intentions were...

Long story short he ended up in hospital, and he was close to death. Severed an artery and if myself and a few other halls friends didn’t act soon enough he would have died. 

18 years old, dealing with this. The guilt hit me, and all he wanted was a shoulder to cry on and I wasn’t there to let him cry.

33,"Tonsils. The worst piece of the human body. My nemesis. 

Tonsil stores. The vile things that form in the terribly designed potholes of the tonsils. I used to get them occasionally as a child. For the last year, it’s been constant. 

At any given time, I have at least TEN of these sulfuric boulders rotting in my mouth. Usually only 4 or so are visible. The right tonsil is a real piece of work. Looks like a wad of ham. The left one is suspiciously round and normal, except my throat always hurts on that side and occasionally I will feel part of my skull dislodge and slide down my throat, a tonsil stone that outgrew its spot.

I need help. But I’m terrified. This all got worse when I got pregnant and now the baby is 8 weeks old, I just sat here hoping it would go away on its own, that after the baby was born I would go back to normal, back to 3 in a week rather than 50. A tonsillectomy is excruciating to recover from as an adult, or so I’ve heard. Plus, I’m still dealing with an insurance nightmare - I changed insurances 3 times over pregnancy, gave birth on the one with the $13000 deductible, and now I’m on a new one with not a dime paid towards THAT deductible...that’s another rant post in itself. And....I’m breastfeeding. God knows the first thing a doc will do is barely listen and write me a script for antibiotics and then me and the baby end up getting thrush or something. 

If you’re still reading, hang on to your appetites because the next bit here is just repulsive. So, I tend to dig out my mouth every few days, once they get big enough. They sell these pointy q-tips at Target that are my tool of choice. Last nights excavation was the most fruitful I’ve ever experienced...and the scariest. I hit the usual spots, visible ones first. I’ve got the equivalent of a pants pocket on the top of one tonsil that takes a good 11 tries to fully empty. A roll of tonsil under that, the accessibility of which is unlocked after its neighbor is cleared. The sore throat and the bad taste never leave with those, however. The wad of ham on the right has a dirtier secret. 

Above that tonsil is a hole. I’m not sure if my tonsils actually are supposed to extend upwards, or if it’s my sinus cavity or what. I seriously wish I understood throat anatomy better. But there’s a hole on each side above the tonsil (I can’t get to the left side without nearly puking, bad angle to scrape out). And within it...INFINITE tonsil stones. Infinite. 45 minutes and I had dug out FIFTEEN stones just from the one hole. Maybe it’s all one thing, like sand in a straw, breaking apart as I violate a part of my body I didn’t know existed with a wet q-tip desperate to remove the stink from my mouth. It’s like finding you have dead bugs in your ear...you would not be able to stop removing them until you’re fixed. Some of the stones coming out of there....I’m talking they’re a full centimeter in diameter. One had a bit of extra material on it that literally looked like a bit of white skin ripped off. Yeah, I’m gagging writing this. And worst of all, the more I removed the darker in color they got and the worse they smelled. I was scared one would come out all bloody or something, but if that exists I couldn’t reach it anyways. Eventually I couldn’t dig anymore, I had to sit there making a gagging noise to prompt them to come down from wherever the FUCK that hole leads to. 

I am scarred. Scared. Stinky. 1 hour of that and it’s like I never went in there at all. I dunno what to do. I’m gonna call the doctor tomorrow but I can’t think of a single outcome of this where I win.

She pushed you away when you needed her.  Don’t make the same mistake for your friends; they might need you.

You lost her in August, and for good reason.  It was never going to get better.  You know that.  Especially with her jumping right to another man.

She lied to you when she called you beautiful.  She lied when she said she wanted to have your babies.  All you ever did was open your heart for her opportunities to do such things with you, and all she ever did was deny you and push you away and make life hard.

I enjoyed her as a teacher.

But, one day, she just...vanished. All Day, i heard people saying that she was gone. SUre enough, they were true. I got to her class and All her pictures and decorations on the wall were gone. Everything, she left without saying a word. 

There were rumors she went crazy. Nobody knew. None of the kids did, i even asked the assistant teacher. Her exact reply was ""Some times it's best too let sleeping dogs lie"" and refused to talk about it.

I mean, she loved her students, she wouldn't just up and leave without telling someone. If it was something like a new job or changing schools. I mean, it was the middle of the week and she seemed perfectly fine the previous day.",29May2019,8

51,"Do you remember in Elementary School, when they had those AR Tests? They were tests about reading a book, you read it and you get a certain amount of points based on how challenging the book was.

I hated it, i never even cracked open a book, except when necessary. In 5th Grade, to motivate kids into reading, they'd have a party for kids in class who got enough  points. Pizza party or a movie. If you didn't get enough, you had to go to the Quiet Room and read for 2 hours.

Now, right before my teacher called out all who weren't supposed to be in class for the movie, i had to pee. I asked to go to the bathroom.  When i got back, i noticed that a good number of kids were missing. I didn't speak up, i just sat in my seat. Bug Eyed and on the verge of freaking out. I thought i was about to get into so much trouble.

But i didn't. She dimmed the lights. I couldn't even watch the movie because i was so scared of getting called out for being there when i wasn't supposed to. I tried ducking and hiding in my desk, praying to God she wouldn't notice me still there.

I guess Being the quiet, invisible kid sure helped out from time to time. I got to watch the whole movie.

52,"I'm 20, he was 20. He died due to brain hypoxia. The doctors have no idea how it happened. The news was broken to us by his brother on our discord server.

I cried once while on the toilet the day I found out. The next day I'm fine and I don't feel sad or angry. It's business as usual for me; I'm cheerful, friendly and hanging out with other people just as I was before. His death became a conversational topic for maybe 5 - 10 minutes before switching topics. He hasn't come up since.

Other people in the discord chat are talking about how much they miss him and how sad they are. Obviously I miss him and I am not content that he is gone, but it happened, and I can't say I am active feeling any emotions towards his death anymore. Less and less I think about him or his death. It has been maybe 10 days since we learned of these events.

Clearly, there is a large disconnect between me and my friends. We all hung out together at uni so it's not like I didn't know him as well as they did. He was a pretty cheerful and fun guy to talk and argue with. Yet I don't mourn him, at least not the amount my friends do. 

I only have a few encounters with the death of a close person. So one would think that the totally unexpected death of a close friend would be devastating. Yet, this isn't the case. 

Currently, to make 'amends' for not feeling sad/mourning. I am thinking of a way to memorialize his life. It is the least I owe to him, or at least to the group of friends. I can't owe anything to a dead person. I feel as if I am only sympathizing with the sad feelings of my friends, rather than feeling anything towards his death.

Am I a bad person? I try to be reflective on myself and my thoughts, and my inability to feel sad at an incredibly tragic death of a close one has me wondering much about myself.",29May2019,1

It's not a big deal. We broke up more than a year and a half ago, and I was the one who interrupted the relationship. We lasted for a lot of years together, but I was no longer in love with him —and he was feeling low-key the same way.
I'm in a very serious relationship right now. We're about to celebrate our first anniversary together, and we're seriously considering to marry in the next couple of years. I'm madly in love with my current partner —but why it hurt so much to see that photo?

58,"After months of tests, seeing various specialists with no resolve. A doctor thinks he’s figured out my problem.  

Sooo The doctor said he’s pretty sure I have Neurocardiogenic syncope. It results when something triggers a short-term malfunction of the autonomous nervous system (ANS). It is also known as neurally mediated syncope (NMS).

The ANS affects heart rate, digestion, respiration rate, salivation, perspiration, diameter of the pupils, urination, and sexual arousal. Most of these actions are involuntary, but some, such as breathing, can also be done consciously.

There will be a drop in blood pressure and the heartbeat and pulse rate will slow down. This causes a temporary interruption in the brain's blood and oxygen supply.

Possible triggers include:

suddenly seeing something that is unpleasant or shocking, such as blood
sudden exposure to an unpleasant sight or experience
sudden emotional upset, for example when receiving bad news
extreme embarrassment
standing still for a long time
being in a hot and stuffy place for a long time
Occupational, or situational, syncope is a type of neurocardiogenic syncope, but the link is physical rather than emotional, mental, or abstract.


These triggers below apply to me more than the ones above.  Coughing and laughing really hard has caused me to pass out.   

Triggers may include:

coughing or sneezing
laughing or swallowing
defecating or urinating
demanding physical activities, such as lifting a heavy weight

65,"Sometimes you must take matters into your own hands. We're supposed to protect our children; I once said to you I got you because you got me and in that moment I made a promise to myself that will stay with me untill the day that I die. Without you here that promise goes unkept and in turn an agreement is broken.. Even in death a debt will remain that must be paid. Continents could burn and it wouldn't hinder the fact that I made a promise to the gods, to the gods of all and where they heard they also spoke. They spoke words of power and trust, such words weighed so heavily that no mortal could ever repeat them.


Yet here we are.


I pray to the 9 morning and night you be returned to me but that's not how gods work, so I forfeited my own soul and pray I be forgiven. It was in a darkness I have never felt before where I lay and sucumbed &amp; in that moment I knew I had no choice if I wanted to keep my promise.. Continents will burn; in their fire the families of the innocent shall purge. Devastating. Funny the things we do for love. Funny how the whispers of a god could turn something so delicate into something so destructive. Like lamb to dragon I could now fly and search for you. A tool the gods had never given me before and I had prayed so patiently.. But it matters not.


You are the first thing I think of when I awake and the last thing I think of before I sleep. When I die my soul will be cast to the depths of hell and there I shall think of you. The gods might work in mysterious ways but so do I. They'll regret the day they did not listen, now it's not just my prayer that goes unanswered - it's the prayers of millions. 


What is one life compared to that of all of them?


Was it not righteous for them to strike me down before I got this far? Oppourtunity was there; they saw this coming and they did *nothing*. As if it was meant to be. So be it. Named after a queen and watched over by the protectors I, protector of all have forfeit my own soul, life and loves in order to find and return you to your rightful place. If it is not the gods will then it is our will. Suddenly the gods are not so strong when you cannot be stopped. Not so fearful, not so wise.


I look forward to the day where I will see the look on their faces and in turn theirs to mine. Was it worth it? It was just one prayer. Now you've damned the world for all eternity.

I'll try to keep this as short as I can. So, last year I left my girlfriend of two years. She was my first girlfriend I truly loved, my girlfriends before that weren't love more of FWB, but this girl was wonderful. She was absolutely perfect, but near two years of being together she didn't seem as happy and I as I asked her about it she said she didn't love me anymore. I poured my heart into that relationship and I got obsessed with her after breaking up, Calling her every day, texting her asking to come back, but to no avail. Since our break up I've gotten better, but over the past year since it happened, I haven't been able to actually feel emotions for anyone wither it be a good friend or people in horrible situations. So my question to whoever is willing to help is. Is there something wrong with me?",29May2019,2
72,"My (M19) LDR girlfriend (F18) of over a year just left me. It was quite amicable as we had been having problems regarding communication and expectations we set with each other and we both agreed we needed to take some time apart to work on ourselves. I can’t help but know it’s all my fault though. 

Our relationship was a dream. The way I felt about this girl is unlike any feeling I’ve ever thought someone could be capable of feeling about another human being. I love her in every sense of the word and saw my future with her as a given, and before that the very thought of marriage and children used to sicken me. I now found myself daydreaming about it!

Unfortunately I have a lot of issues that got in the way of our closeness. When I started college I guess I just got overwhelmed with everything going on there (plus a little animosity/jealousy towards her for her past relationships, which I got over in time) and it was around that time that what I suspected to be mental illness began to manifest itself as psychotic episodes and mood swings which also affected things. That coupled with my sheer inability to have any motivation to do things naturally took a toll on the relationship (it took me months to start going to therapy ((which I have not kept up with unfortunately)) and months to buy plane tickets to go visit her even though I had the time of my life there and feel truly alive and safe with her). 

Come summer I think I started getting too much into my head about how she felt about me and I was afraid that my issues and cognitive decline have caused me to change and lose some of the characteristics that she fell in love with in the first place, and as such out of a kind of fear and embarrassment I talked with her rarely (one call a day, pretty much) and today, somewhat out of the blue, she broke up with me because of it, citing numerous valid reasons. 

Now, I recognize that relationships end all the time, and I recognize that nearly everyone experiences heartbreak, but I literally cannot fathom loving another human being. I can’t imagine becoming so infatuated with someone like I did with her, I can’t imagine caring about someone else’s problems the way I did hers, I can’t imagine living in absolute paradise because of someone else’s existence the way I did with her. And nor would I want to. I told her I will wait for her because she implied maybe in time we will be together again but she also seemed to say that she doesn’t know whether or not she believes that and that hurt very much. 

I am so tempted to beg her to reconsider and I would do anything to be better for her but deep down I know she doesn’t deserve me because of my faults and issues and for that reason I feel lost. What can I do? I can and will try to better myself for if/when she comes back into my life, but without any certainty of that I feel lost. 

For unrelated reasons I have very few friends, and pretty much none at college for next year, and as she and I happily relied on each other for emotional support I now have nowhere to turn. I want nothing more than to wrap myself up in my blanket, call her, and hear that beautiful, soft, calming voice that I’ve fallen so deeply in love with and that lets me know everything is going to be okay because she’s with me. But now I can’t, and I know I shouldn’t try to convince her otherwise, at least not yet. 

I will never give up on this girl, I know that sounds cliche but the nature of our relationship is unlike anything I have ever experienced before. I am an untrusting, sadistic antihero (I guess) type of person due to my upbringing, but in her arms I am the kind and loving person I always wished I could be. What can I possibly do now that I have lost that? Where to turn from here?",29May2019,0

I have already encoded the grades, which means I would to write the university to reopen my account so I could change the grades. Additionally, I already gave plenty of fucking chances for these students to raise their grades. I even had individual consultations with them constantly so they know how they're faring in my class.

""this is too epic"" I  thought as I smelled it and started pooing and peeing on top of her poo  and pee. suddenly I heard a knock at the door, when I opened it I saw it  was my old friends: The Poo Boys. ""why are you here?"" I asked as I  hyper scatted all over the couch. ""we'll show you why"" they said as all  three of them suddenly started diarrheaing onto the floor before my  sister ran in and also started defecating.

it  was at that moment that my phone started ringing, I answered it to hear  Farting Gerald tell me to come to his office immediately so I got in my  car and begun the trip. ten minutes later my car stopped in the middle  of the woods, I looked at the dashboard lights while farting ""just as I  thought, no gas"". I got out of the car and removed the gas cap, luckily  my car didn't just run on fuel, it also ran on my awesome poos. so all I  had to do was unleash a big stinky load into the gas tank and the car  was moving again in no time.

when I got  to Farting Gerald's office the receptionist called me over and asked if I  had an appointment. I noticed she had also been pooing and peeing all  over the waiting room which caused me to start urinating and defecating  as well before Farting Gerald called me into his office. I asked him  what he needed me for as I pooed on the chair and he said that his poos  weren't very smelly recently which upset him greatly. I asked him to let  me smell and he shot big poo out of his awesome bum all over the desk.  he was right, it wasn't stinky at all but I gave him a list of the foods  I eat which keep me stinkin' and told me to try it out.

the  next few days where very busy for me. I had to split my time between  pooing, peeing, farting, defecating, stinking, urinating, brapping,  scatting and even dropping hotties so I hardly had any time to catch up  with Farting Gerald but I eventually got a call say his poos are so  stinky now that everyone at the office quit.",29May2019,0

94,"Sometimes on the day of a test and group of girls would come up to me before it started and explained to me the “plan” on how they were going to cheat. They’d show me a drawing of the classroom and explained “Alright OP, you’ll sit here, near the front but not too close to the teacher. I’ll copy you from the right and (girl1) will copy from the left. Then (two other girls) will copy me from the right and back and...” you get the idea. I just let it happen on the condition I wouldn’t get in trouble because they were looking at my test and I wasn’t giving them any of the answers.

Other times if we had to write on a blank piece of paper the answer to one question (usually related to the book we were reading), they’d write their answers in Spanish and I’d translate them. I usually finished quite quickly so it wasn’t hard for me to quickly translate their answers (and the teacher was busy doing other work so she never noticed).

At first I wasn’t so lenient on helping them but after a few years it just became a feeling of “You’re the one missing out on the opportunity to learn a foreign language by letting a native speaker do the work for you. You’re the one who’s going to have problems speaking with foreigners at some point”, so I didn’t really care at the end of the day.

It's not much different than a modern-day Soviet Union, without the famines and dictators.

Brexit is a peaceful rebellion - a nation who wants to take back control of its own borders, among other things, that the European Union is trying to do for them, and voted themselves out. No violence and no bloodshed. Instead, they used their vote.

Brexit's main appeal is giving the United Kingdom control over their own destiny without having an overseer and somebody who can impose its own policies on them without the people's right to vote on it.

A lot of the politicians in the UK are trying to make Brexit a failure. What should have been a decision made by the people and executed by their leaders is now almost entirely in a parliament of charlatans.",29May2019,0

101,"I will not feel sorry for myself for another minute. It took writing out an entire rant to realize that I have some underlying determination to not take responsibility for my own messes sometimes. My life is completely manageable- I have no serious handicaps or immediate health risks, no debt, full custody of my son, no drug addictions or legal troubles. Now, I know the world doesn’t have to be ending to be valid in feeling overwhelmed, we’re only humans and depending on what’s going on it can be hard to process even minor bumps in the road. From where I stand, though, I want to come at issues from a place of confidence when at all possible and my internal monologue is the only one standing in the way. Yes, my new puppy had diarrhea all over my new carpets BUT they’re easier to clean because they’re multicolored earth tone. Yes, I have no money until Friday BUT I have food to eat until then and I have work. Yes, I lose my patience with my son at times BUT the love and kindness i show him is consistent enough that he forgives me. These are small things that I almost held against myself as proof of failure. 
**I reframed that idea and realized- **
I’m so successful that I raise a child on my own, I’m so successful that I was able to get that child a puppy, I’m so successful that I made sure we had enough food to eat until pay day and continue to be on time to work, I’m so successful that even when I yell at my son, his confidence in my love for him isn’t shaken. 

These minor hardships and problems are the shockingly low price I pay for all the moments of joy... this is real life and it’s not too much for me. Every day I work towards gaining more ground than I lose and I’m gonna keep going. What my mom always said was true- the only way you lose is if you don’t try.",29May2019,6

Now I'm 19 and get tired out pretty quick. 

I've never been a big lifter either but I've been getting somewhere with the shit routine I've been doing. 10 pushups, 20 seconds of planking, 10 curl-ups, 5 chin-ups, 20 seconds of jumping jacks, 10 squats, and random stretches in between those exercises. It's sloppy but I've definitely been seeing an increase in numbers. Used to do like 3 push ups, now I'm doing 10 so yah. 

I wanna get bigger and healthier. Any tips would be awesome. I don't have the money nor the want to go to a gym so I wanna focus strictly at home. I've got an exercise mat, a pull-up bar on my bathroom door, and a punching dummy that I never knew was called Bob haha. Any apps, videos, subreddits, personal experiences, anything would be appreciated. 

Truthfully I've never been motivated to do this stuff until my recent breakup. I could make a whole 'nother post about that but I don't wanna think about that right now.

105," My roommates and I believe our apartment was invaded. Currently, six people have access to the apartment. All parties are unsure of how this happened.

Over the last weekend, I noticed that a blanket had been meticulously draped over the monitor of one of my roommate’s computer. That roommate was out of town at the time so I took a mental note of the oddity; however, I didn’t think too much of it.

Fast forward to yesterday, one of my other roommates came back from a trip. She noticed that her bed was not made (it was when she left) and a piece of green gum was placed on the small surface area below her window. For future note, she always keeps her window open. 

After my roommate had told me about this, I made the connection to the disturbed blanket in the other room. 

We live on the third floor of a student housing complex; however, there is a gate located directly behind the building that someone could easily climb to reach a flat roof above the parking garage that would lead you directly to the room with the open window. The gate is no more than a few hundred feet away from the window. 

Seemingly, nothing else was touched. We have no other theories. Someone must have climbed the fence, walked over the roof of the parking garage, and invaded our apartment leaving only a messy bed, a piece of chewed gum, and a blanket over a monitor. 

Over the timeframe that the invasion occurred, two people were in town. Me and a roommate separate from the two already mentioned. I am out pretty often, but I still spend a good bit of time at the apartment. The present roommates is home more often. If someone did break in, it is possible that me or my roommate were present. 

We have contacted the main office of the building and are awaiting a review of security footage. This, however, may not provide any information if the invader came in and out through the window as the building does not have security of that area. Only on the inside and the front. We are waiting for that information before contacting the police.

108,"Well, first things first, I’ve been video games designer for the past 4 years. It’s a cool job, but really stressful sometimes. As years has passed I’ve been noticing that I’ve lost my will to play video games. Also, I’ve felt several times that I no longer have that passion to design games. I prefer to be more in the programming part of the things. Despite I’m not engineer, I like programming. 

These changes are motivated (probably) due to several and profound changes in my life. Anxiety kicked in two yeas ago and I broke up with my 5yo gf five or six months ago. These two events changed me a lot, more insecurities than ever, more self doubt and the constant idea that I’ve nothing that cheers me up. I can’t even find a “dream” to fight for (not talking about suicide here, nor nothing similar)

The idea of changing my career comes because I feel everything that surrounds it (the city, the mood, the industry) has contributed to my current state. It’s like I can’t find a positive thing that has happened to me since I got here. 

Also, I think I’m too old to change what I’m doing and...I don’t really now what else I like to do(I think this is the worst part) as I don’t have enough time to do (or find) new hobbies (except some fitness that helps me to clear my mind)

110,"Hi first of all I may digress a bit , maybe not make sense as I’m really fucking pissed off . 
Backstory 
My mum (65) was diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer in November 2018 . December 2018 15th to be exact she had her right kidney removed. 
Cancer had spread to her back , 6th rib and a tumour by her spine like 6mm away . So she was told chemotherapy won’t work - radiation therapy is more appropriate. Mum had 6 ‘blasts’ of radiation therapy and was scanned 3 months later . That scan revealed her cancer was slow growing, it hadn’t grown . Basically no change . 
Fast forward 3 months 
Mum went for scan , unfortunately it revealed it had become aggressive and there are now more tumours in her back . Her 6/7/8 th ribs are now affected . There is another one on her spine and the one that was 6mm away is now touching her spine . 
Mum is experiencing tingling in her legs , they ache . Her back is constantly hurting her , she’s now taking her oramorph - which she wouldn’t at first ( morphine- she thought she’d be hooked on it and hallucinate) . 
Her taking it means SHE IS IN PAIN. 
She has said if she ends up in a chair so be it , at least I’m alive . Her future is bleak . She’s just had a blast - that’s where this story is heading . 
Two weeks ago my mum went for radiation therapy, she told me she was half way when she remembered her phone and purse - thought she would leave it etc ... my mums appointment was for 4pm . 
At 4.01 exactly , £80 was taken from her bank account from a atm up the road . Only she was home PLUS my mum , her mum was , at that moment having radiation.
Mum has had issues before on her account- she’s too soft with it - for example she gave my brother her details so he could have Xbox live . He never deleted them as promised and mum being mum didn’t check - a year she was paying for it . Top ups for EE phone £10 whenever my sister had no credit . A Netflix account from her bank - mum doesn’t have Netflix.  She changed her pin , regularly changes it . She sent my sister to the bank for money , forgot to change it - so she knew the pin !!!! 
She is scum . Doesn’t know I know . Mum obviously knows but doesn’t want her husband to know as quite rightly he’ll kick her out . 
Mum goes on holiday in 4 days with her sister , she hasn’t got hardly any money for spends. My sister has stolen over £600 from mum . 
There is so much more to this too - 
Mum has been amazing- my sister gave up her kids and is now fighting for them back ( Diagnosed with severe post ND) . Mum has her grandson a hell of a lot and has told the judge she will have all the kids and her daughter in her house .... she’s terminally ill and is broken by her grandkids being in care - her daughter stealing from her... it’s all too much . 
I’ve watched my other siblings take the piss , my brother uses her house for a stop off so he takes his 4 kids there all the time when HE has contact coz he can’t be bothered to do anything with them . 
Point of all this is 
Do I tell her husband ? I can’t hold this information in .. would It cause the family to tear apart, if I say nothing bitchface gets away with it. 
I don’t want trouble, but c’mon ... what would you do ? Thank you .. HELP

She has a friend that is working with me at the same institute at the university. Last fall we were on a conference and while we were talking, I asked her if my crush is still single. She said something like No, or I don't know.

Recently we were again on a conference and I asked her again. Now she says she has no permission (from her) to tell me.

She claims that this is neither yes or no, but come on .... that is so a yes ... I need to know, and this is so fucking cruel....

122,"Around 175GB to be more accurate, I m a teenager, so it's not like its completely my fault. My hormones influence my behaviour and in fact, despite having such a large amount of porn. I dont watch porn as often as one 'd expect. 

Here is the problem; I m come across a really good scene. Then I see 10 or more similar other scenes in the recommended and I take them into my collection as well. Note these videos are full and HD 720p. So each video is around 300-400 Mb. I dont have a subscription to any of the porn studios like Brazzers or DigitalPlayground, I just find a scene and get its name e.g. ""All Night Rager Kimmy Granger"" and put it onto Google. It's not pirating, it's kind of like putting a book's title in Google and adding ""pdf"" at the end of it. I even have a website that I found that occasionally provides these full HD videos and I download them via IDM. I m not going to plug them, you are free to DM tho

Anyways, it feels like it's more of a problem of keeping a collection than a porn addiction. Porn as obviously doesn't have any negative impact on my life and doesnt affect it, I m still getting good grades, working out the gym consistently, having a normal social life. In fact, I probably have over 50-60 scenes in my folder that I have downloaded and never seen.

The real real problem, is that I have a laptop with only 500 GB of storage and I m reluctant to transfer all my porn to a hard drive because I m afraid it might fall into the wrong hands. And deleting it is the most difficult part because if I delete all of it, i will just end up missing it and start up a new collection all over again. The other thing is on how many websites delete their videos, so if I never delete the videos in my folder, I ll never lose them regardless of what happens to the website from which I downloaded it from.",29May2019,3

124,"I lost all my weight but my self esteem is lower than ever. 

I was overweight between 13-17 and only 5 foot and carried most of this weight in my cheeks and stomach and it destroyed my self confidence. I was also born being socially anxious always avoiding pictures and gatherings etc, hating small talk and meeting new people.

I lost all of it between 17-18 and grew to a little over 5 foot 9 which isn't great but its average and better than I'd hoped for. Im now 19 and weigh a little over 9 and a half stone with very little body or facial fat. I go running twice a week now and to the gym 3 times a week with a resting heart rate of approx 53, I'm quite physically fit now. 

But its done nothing to improve my self confidence, if anything its worse. If someone looks at me in the street I look away and fear to make eye contact because it makes me feel like they are better than me. If someone is in the same room or area as me I feel self conscious and imagine everyone judging me and it makes me feel like I'm inferior to everyone around me.  I go to any and all lengths to blend into the background so noone focusses their attention on me because it makes me feel judged and inferior again. My self consciousness and anxiety makes me feel like I'll die alone because I'll never have the confidence to approach anyone because I'm not good enough.

I can rationalise that looks arent everything and that im exaggerating in the logical part of my brain when I'm alone but in practise my amygdala overrides everything. I know personality is more important and despite how it sounds I don't think I have a bad personality I'm fine making friends and have quite a few but it just takes me a while to get comfortable with people. 

Ive learnt that approval and self acceptance eally is a state of mind and is not tied to your exterior. I thought losing weight would help me but the emotional scarring of being fat on top of an inherit disposition towards anxiety means I can't move on. How do I move on because I don't want to get to a point of no return where I completely ruin my life?

129,"I always so quickly fall out of “love”, i start to focus on bad traits in them and I suddenly start pathologically hating them. I always end it up, never been with someone for a year even when it looks so perfect in the start, i just grow super bored in months. I hate this in me, i hate hurting them, i hate leaving without a good enough reason for them, they’d think everything was a lie from the start but it wasn’t. I don’t know how to fix this, i stopped trying, because every trial means hurting another person and i feel worse everytime.",29May2019,3
130,"So I’m a mixed(Nigerian and European)human person. I have a problem with both terms. 

The term Black just kinda seems outdated. I feel like it was just used to label people from Africa something completely opposite of the people colonizing them? My skin isn’t even close to black. It’s brown. But apparently Indian people are the “brown” people? I have an Indian friend who is like 7 shades darker than me, and somehow he is labeled Brown and I am Black. 

African American seems more politically correct, because it’s more than just an inaccurate color, but also I have no connection to Africa/Nigeria. I was raised by white people and never learned any part of the Nigerian culture. I guess I feel like I’m really not African at all, I’m just American. It’s where I grew up. It’s my culture. It’s what I know. 

I guess the problem with both is that I don’t think I’m “black enough” or “African enough” to be labeled as those terms. 

There no perfect solution for this problem, at least not yet. I just wanted to post this to see what other people(of any nationality)think.",29May2019,0
131,"I've been playing fallout 4 almost everyday for the past week now. I've recently developed a special interest in it (I'm autistic) so I've just been really into it lately, but I have a problem with it. 

Everytime I play fallout, i will just. Forget about reality while I'm playing it. Suddenly the outside world no longer exists, and Im in the wasteland, killing raiders and managing the fields at Abernathy Farms. It's like that until I turn it off and then I realize I've been playing for 8 hours.

Even before I developed a SpIn in it, that would happen. Back in 2014 when I would play fallout 3, everytime I stopped playing I had to remind myself I am in the real world, and no, a feral ghoul will not attack me if I walk down the hallway. It used to be that bad, but not anymore. 

Normally I'm pretty good at telling the difference between reality and fiction. I know fallout isn't real but when I'm playing it, I'm so into it, that everything around me just doesn't really seem to matter or even exist.

I also have sensory processing disorder which doesn't help. It affects my ability to assess what my body needs, and usually I don't feel hungry until my stomach hurts from no food or until I'm shaking from low blood sugar. I think you can probably see why being sucked into fallout also affects this. Playing a game for up to 5-8 hours a day coupled with not being able to sense what my body needs something is a pretty bad combo

This doesn't happen with any other game, just fallout. No I don't play it in VR either, but I'm pretty sure if i did I'd never take off the headset lol.

I feel like the best way to not deal with that problem would be to not play it but there isn't any other way I can think of to help me engage with my special interest. Watching playthrus just isn't the same. I want to be able to have fun with my SI but it's literally affecting my day to day life in ways that aren't good.",29May2019,7
132,"Im a guy 24 and i find crop tops so sexy n attractive.
It is one of the few modern female fashion that I really  love.
I girl in a crop  top is really  hot for me, it so attractive, specially not so skinny tip.",29May2019,0
133,I accidentally got scammed and I got tricked into sending my IP and the state and city that i live in to someone. Any advice on what I can do?,29May2019,2
135,"So happy it’s done with! Kidney stone was possibly the worst pain I’ve had in my entire life, so bad that I wished that I could get trashed on morphine. 

This stone had been in me for 6 months! Usually they pass after 1~ month but it got stuck and I need a stent after 2 months . The stent stopped the pain but it also meant I pissed blood just from a bit of walking. I was actually sent to the hospital by my boss who was concerned because I seemed like I was really struggling.

Finally today,  I had surgery to destroy the stone. (It didn’t take 6 months to get surgery but there was concerns previous months and prioritising cancer patients)  I’m pissing shards and that hurts but it’s pretty awesome that it’s over and done with. 

Now to prevent getting kidney stones again.",29May2019,3
136,"I know that feeling like you have something to prove is not always a good thing, but in this case I think it turned out pretty well. 

I won’t give you my life story but essentially, I went to a Catholic high school for the last 4 years and at the end of my sophomore year I realized I’m gay. The thing about Catholic high schools, of which I’m sure you’re all aware, is that there a many people who don’t like gay people. Throughout my four years, I was told that gays are evil, sinful, and are going to hell. When I realized I am gay, I was terrified that this would be those people’s only image of me. A sinner, an evil person, someone who is bound to suffer eternally. So I decided I wanted to become a person that challenges those beliefs, not just through my words but through my actions and the person I am. 

I went through a lot of self reflection that summer and since then, I’ve been doing a few things. First, I accepted that I am gay and accepted myself as I am as a whole, including my faults. Then I began attempting to seek out and iron out every fault that I could find. Obviously I’m still working on that one, but it was the first time I actually looked at who I am and said to myself “this is not the person I want to be” and so I started making changes, and boy did it pay off. I ended up coming out, being elected the student body president a few months later, captaining the soccer team, winning a few awards, getting into my dream college, and on Saturday I’ll be giving the student graduation speech. 


After facing a whole lot of adversity in my family life and my personal life (which I won’t go into), I feel extremely satisfied with my life. And it doesn’t even compare to the satisfaction I have with what I have proved to those asshole bigots who tried to tell me that I am a shitty person. I know this might sound braggy or egocentric but the truth is that there is no one in my school as accomplished, as loved, or as looked up to as me and they know it. It feels incredibly good to have shown them that I, the person who is supposed to be bad, have grown into one of the best people ever to have left my school. 

Expectations: subverted,  motherfuckers.",29May2019,3
137," I always see families or friends taking picture and person taking the person is always left out. But as a hobbyist photographer, that always made me feel the wrong way. So I always ask if they want a picture together. I like to think it’s my way of spreading little happiness around.",29May2019,2
138,"Like the title says, I have dreams that I've just had a second daughter. It's killing me because not only will I not have kids, my only daughter isn't biologically mine. I won't go in to too many details, but I'm not able to see her because my ex thinks I'm conspiring against her, it's been about a month (my daughter is 9 if that helps).

I don't know if my dreams are telling me I miss my little girl, or telling me to replace her. Either option hurts just as bad and I don't know what to do.",29May2019,1
139,"I just recently secured a full-time job in the field I want, which is great! The only problem is that actually getting started with work is like pulling teeth. I’ve been technically employed for three weeks now and have shadowed for a total of three days. That’s it. I quit my previous part-time job in order to take this job, and now I’m essentially unemployed. I’m making zero money.

Although I live with my parents, so my living expenses aren’t ridiculous, they’d like me to move out sooner rather than later. I need money for that. On top of that, I’m not even sure I want to really settle down in the area now, and since this new job isn’t going well so far, I might as well start all over in another city… but job hunting is additional stress. 

But wait, there’s more!

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about six months now, but this weekend he expressed his doubts about the relationship. He’s in a period of transition and so he isn’t ready for something super serious, and he feels as though our relationship is headed that way. He clarified that we weren’t breaking up, but said he needed space. I heard from him a bit yesterday, but then I told him last night that I understood his need for space and I’d be here when he wanted to talk, and I haven’t heard from him since. A large part of me thought he would message me today, and now I’m worried he’ll never reach out and that it’ll just end in this quiet, confusing way. I’m horribly sad and anxious about it and I miss him dearly.

All of this has happened in the past month. I’ve been doing my best but I still feel like my life is going downhill and I don’t know what to do. I can’t think clearly. I’ve lost my appetite. I can’t fall asleep, and then when I am asleep, I can’t force myself out of bed in the morning. 

I’m so sad and frustrated and lonely and anxious. I’m looking for any sort of advice, really.",29May2019,1
140,"I don’t value anything in life. My parents, 4 brothers, girlfriend (19) ( I cheated) (6 mo relationship), or myself. I highly believe this is due to pornagraphy. Every attractive woman I see I want to have sex with. I am too materialistic at times. I am so ashamed and I don’t know what to do. How can I learn to value as I should? :( i am so selfish and only care for myself- maybe , idek. I’m just so lost, I’m not depressed, at least I don’t think. I think ima better and smarter than everyone else but I’m starting to see I’m not. I’m a piece of shit.",29May2019,5
141,"Throwaway.

I was at the beach this weekend and I ran into Martin, my little brother's chubby geeky friend. My brother sold him his Playstation 4 to buy a Nintendo Switch. Martin told him he would pay him back the next week. That was 2 month's ago.

Running into him on the beach, I bumped into him and his geeky Ninja Turtles shirt and lime-green bathing suit. I asked when he's paying back my brother, as I towered over him (I'm a 6 foot tall rugby player, he's a 5'6 nerd.) ""I'll get it when I get it.""

I always hated that geek's condescending fucking tone. I told him to give me something for collateral, at least.

He said ""I don't have any collateral, you chubby bitch.""

I was furious. But then I realized, oh, he does actually have collateral.

And 3 minutes later, he was frantically running across the beach back to his house 2 blocks away.

And I was walking off with a Ninja Turtles shirt, flip-flops and a lime-green bathing suit.",29May2019,0
142,"I had been applying to so many jobs for months (and years if you count the time I was in a different country applying for bachelors related jobs). 
I started getting depressed because they would never call back. It’s true, I’m shy and awkward, but they wouldn’t even take me for minimum wage jobs. 

Then I had this interview at a company (didn’t even know the pay), they made me wait for like 20 min, I was about to walk away because I shouldn’t be waiting for a job I obviously won’t get! Someone showed up and my interview began. They offered me the job and it wasn’t minimum wage! (Just a little bit more). It’s not the best job but I got it! And i can pay the bills!

That happened 2 years ago and I’m still working there. I know, i have to find something better soon but just thinking about interviews makes me want to throw up.",29May2019,147
143,"So basically I love my family, but I can tell, that I can go two directions follow their ethics/morals or create my own.I don’t believe in their world, because it’s old and not the good kind (the type that doesn’t expect anything but their way).But I’m consistently surrounded by them and drowned by their essence. I still am surrounded by other people with different backgrounds, but because of how I grew up and how Im surrounded. I don’t fit in I guess, or I just feel misplaced sometimes. I really don’t know what to do, I’ve tried to be different, and it feels pointless (I’ve made a reddit about it too). I’ve become depressed about it and got into shit I shouldn’t have. I’m failing a class and have finals next week.my brother is leaving me like my mom. But I’m probably just stressed and exhausted .  I’d like to hear advice or a story.",29May2019,2
145,"I find that I get so emotional when I'm alone. I hate being at home, and I'll even drive to the mall to be around people. I don't really have a close circle of friends, either. Work used to be my thing, and now my hours are cut. I haven't been in school in forever because it hasn't worked out for me (nursing is so fxcking competitive...). 

Also, my mom and I haven't gotten along well the past couple of months. I'm 21F, she wants me home by 10pm, but I want to hang with friends and have fun! I feel like I'm always held back because ""I can't do that"".

I also feel like I'm a terrible person. I can never remember things people tell me, and I feel guilty about it. I wish I was more independent, a better older sister, and I wish I could go back to the times where I didn't feel alone.",29May2019,5
146,"I’m going to keep this vague, but god, today has been so trying and stressful. I just found out my brother got kicked out of college months ago &amp; my family has been pretending he still goes, he told me his girlfriend had a miscarriage, she spoke to me on the phone for 2 hours about her problems &amp; their problems &amp; awful things he’s been doing with his life &amp; im just...I’m just so broken. It’s a lot. I’ve been trying to help him. Everyone has. It hurts so much to see your sibling ruining their life and trying so much and not being able to help or get through to them. &amp; to know a 16 year old muslim girl is dealing with this and...I can’t stop crying and I miss being able to tell you everything, you would always listen to me vent and it helped. I can’t stop crying, the stress is overwhelming and I’m trying to help everyone as best as I can. And myself. I wish I could talk to you about this.",29May2019,2
