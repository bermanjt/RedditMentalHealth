0,I make youtube videos as a side hobby and as a way to show off to me friends but they're all really amateur and admittedly pretty cringey videos that get little to no views. Some stuff has been bad stuff nobody cares about has been happening lately and naturally I've been down. I posted one of my shitty montages and in the middle of being a depressed piece of trash my friend texted me that he really liked my video. I know its garbage and he's the only like on it but having him say such a thing made me genuinely cry like a little bitch for a minute. Thanks Brennan. ,10Feb2019,1
1,"I swear it was like it came straight out of a movie. It was about 4 years ago, my first day of English class sophomore year of high school. I was sitting 3 seats behind a new boy in my class, heavily taking notes. The following is what he later relayed to me:

He was sitting in class, looked back towards the clock, and saw me. He thought to himself, “I need to talk to her!” So for the remainder of the class period, unbeknownst to me, he preceded to pretend to drop his pencil and pick it up or pretend to be looking at the time so he could look at me again. He must have done it about 20 times he said, but I, who was buried in my notebook, didn’t notice.He sat there all period thinking of ways he could somehow approach me and ask for my number. Being the really shy guy he is, that was extremely nerve wracking for him. Then, in a glimpse of chance, our English teacher said we were going to be doing a project and had to work with the people in our row. He thought, “This is it!!” I, the devoted student, however, just thought “There’s a new boy sitting up there, I wonder if he will pull his weight or if I will have to do it”.

As I preceded to stand up and tell my group members how I, miss young and driven, will do all the work and that they would only be allowed to edit it, I glanced down and saw the most wonderful thing I have ever seen in my life. It was his face, smiling up at me. My first thought was “Wow, he’s beautiful”. I had seen boys before, but I had never, ever, seen any boy that looked as gorgeous as he did that Tuesday. I did not allow my rapid heart beat to derail my focus for long, of course, and preceded to tell them to let me do all the work. We all exchanged numbers (to his delight) and went on our way.

That night, I was texting in the group chat asking if anyone had any preferences for our PowerPoint format. Immediately, he messaged me outside the group chat with his answer. I thought, “He must not be able to text in a group chat or something” and directed my thoughts back to work. The next morning, he responded to me individually again! I thought, “He seems really nice, I’ll ask him where he’s from. He must not have many friends having just moved here and all.” And then we started texting back and forth.

Around 10 text messages was all it took. I knew after that that he was the one for me, that he was different than any other boy in the entire world. He was charming, sweet, goofy, and really intelligent. He was everything I had ever wanted, but I didn’t even know I wanted until then. I honestly had never felt that way before, and all it took was a few text messages.

Fast forward 4 years and we both attend different colleges, but are as in love as ever. Right after we graduate, I plan to marry him and start our lives together.",10Feb2019,1
2,"The replication crisis is a meme. 

Plenty of studies don't replicate, but are still fruitful. 

Researchers involved in a study are often able to predict if it'll replicate. 

When experiments are repeated, they are often done slightly differently, so that's why they don't replicate, but it's still useful, because they can look at the differences.

4,"My son was on strike 2 for being late/not calling, and today he tells me that he is going to play basketball at the middle school; that's fine, I set the rules and gave him some tips to be successful in timeliness.  His curfew comes and he is not home, so I text him with no response; then I called him, and it went to voicemail.

My alarms are going off and I drive up to the middle school to see he isn't there (starting to panic); drive to the high school, and he isn't there either (full blown panic that is almost disabling); drive to the park by the high school and find him.  I quickly throw the car in park near where he was, dash towards him calling his name, and collapse in an ugly crying heap. His excuse was that he didn't hear his phone and lost track of time (again...); I didn't care, and I was just glad he was safe.  I couldn't raise my voice, or be angry in the moment; I gave him the disciplinary action I told him would happen but nothing more (part of me wanted to lock him in his room till he was married).

Now I know how my dad and step-mom felt when I used to hide in the clothing racks at the store when I was a little kid. Please, if you say you will be somewhere at a specific time and end up being late, call or text. Especially if being late is not one of your character traits.",10Feb2019,1

11,"It feels like yesterday, but our running history began 21 years ago.

My wife Isa and I had always done a lot of sport, but we had never been interested in running, in fact, it seemed like a very boring thing to do. However, being able to run through the mythical 42,195 was a challenge always present in Isa's dreams.

In 1997, at the age of 30, we started training together to face and overcome this challenge, but both of us were too enthusiastic and injured ourselves quite some times within a few weeks of training. Some months later, Isa got pregnant with our first child, Pablo, and while she rested, I trained in a self-taught way to run my first marathon. A week after Pablo's birth (April 1998), I found myself on the starting line of the Madrid marathon and  finished it with, undoubtedly, more suffering than recommended.

I fulfilled Isa´s dream, but she was left with the desire and was not willing to leave it like that. We now had a baby to take care of, but that was not going to stop us; we decided to buy a running stroller to take Pablo with us, something that in 1998 was far from normal. That's how we trained for the next months and, when Pablo was one year old, the three of us found ourselves on the starting line of the Madrid marathon again, now enjoying and finishing the marathon as a family.

From there, we started training on a regular basis, except for the obligatory stops of Isa in the pregnancies of our second children (David in 2001) and some injuries suffered along the way (perks of the trade, I guess). We figured that, since we had one more kid to take care of, we needed more strollers to be able to continue training and ""competing"" together. As a result, we started running marathons with two strollers, and then, when Jose María, our third child, was born, we continued running with a “single” stroller and a twiner, a record that made us well known in our city and appear in several press articles and sports magazines, but above all, it allowed us to enjoy running intensely and as a family.

My work took us from Madrid to Santiago de Chile, where we lived for three years. We then returned to Spain, Zaragoza in particular, where we lived for eight years before we returned to Chile again in 2013, this time to Viña del Mar, where we have lived since.

We have never stopped running.

To this day, we have completed more than 65 marathons, as well as other adventure races like a 100K in Africa. Isa has won multiple races of all kinds in her category and she is the South American half marathon W45 champion, but, despite our award differences, we have had the immense luck of training and competing together at the same pace (very good for her and very mediocre for me). Furthermore, Isa’s love for running took her to creat her own running club, FIT, which, despite starting with just some friends running a couple of days a week, today has almost 200 people who have changed their lifestyle for good and now enjoy a healthy life full of sport.

In 2019 we have proposed ourselves to finish the 6 Majors, something that was always in our plans but that we have not been able to do yet. For this, we have drawn a very demanding plan. We will run Tokyo in March, London in April and Chicago in October. If all goes well, I will finish my 6 Majors in London and Isa will do it a few months later in Chicago.

We started running at a later age than usual and without previous experience, we’ve had 3 children and changed home 4 times, but nothing has stopped us from running. If someone told us 21 years ago that running would play such an important role in our lives, it would have been hard to believe him, but here we are, breaking goals and fulfilling dreams as a family, and we hope to continue doing it for many more kilometers...",10Feb2019,1

The apartment below us has been evacuated for biohazards or something, but they said we’re okay. When I told them that my roommate and I are LITERALLY GAGGING because the smell is so goddamn strong they told us to crack a window and that “there’s nothing we can do right now since it’s after hours.”

We called multiple times the day before and this morning and they said they would send someone up to look at it. Nothing. Zero. Nada. 

To top it off, my friends who live below us who had to move out blame me and my roommate for causing sewage issues. He’s literally pissed and won’t talk to us because he blames us for the entire apartment complex’s shitty sewage issues. We haven’t done anything wrong and we are just as much a victim of this whole situation as he is.

You haven't found someone, someone that take away your loneliness, that makes you smile, and you know they'd do anything for you, that puzzle piece is still missing, you might never find it. You look at things from your past and try to feel the way things used to. That's never gonna happen. You look at people from your past and wish they were still in your life, you've taught yourself better than to think that way. You think you've found peace, why are you still telling yourself that? You feel alone, every night. You crave the presence of someone else, every day. You tell yourself as long as you're happy, you don't need anyone else, and you'll find someone eventually.

29,"The two people I have told this to don’t believe me, which I fair I understand why they would deny this, but this is something I have been wanting to get off my chest for years. So here we go. 

When I was born I had a damaged nerve in my left ear along with a build up of fluid in the ear. So for the first few years of my life this went unnoticed as infants and toddler don’t listen anyway. But when I got into preschool, they thought I was autistic. And I can see why. I was not very social and when the kids knocked over blocks I didn’t react. So my parents thought I was autistic but before wanting to believe it themselves they did everything first, and that’s when they got my hearing checked. The ear doctor told them that a nerve was most likely damaged and that I had a build of fluid in my ears. So the doctor drained them(this doesn’t fix the problem permanently) and then I got tested for any learning disability. All of them came back negative. So in first grade, I had a surgery done on my ears which installed tube that drained my ears for good. And then I moved. 

Second grade started I was able to socialize decently. I was behind on reading and writing but I took a speech class, which a lot of kids took because they had trouble pronouncing things or a hard time articulating words. And by the end of second grade. I was “cured” of the curse that was put on me. Third grade was a relatively lackluster year. I was accepted in to the gifted and talented program in the school and everything seemed fine, until forth grade. 

Forth grade started our fine. I was doing well and there seem to be no problem. But on my second quarter report card a got a 2(which means slightly below grade level or about a B) on writing. My mom freaked out. ‘How could this have happened? Something must have changed for this to happen. Maybe he has a learning disability. I should get him retested.’ is what my mother thought. And so she did. 

Now I do not mean to make my mom seem like a horrible person. She is an amazing mother who cares about me sooo much, but has bad anxiety and a slightly narcissistic personality. So in forth grade she go me tested for any learning disabilities by the school. All of them were negative(which she will deny but she decided to keep all the papers so I have the evidence I need). Denying this and believing that they were lying so they wouldn’t have to put in as much work, she decided to get me tested by “professionals”. These professionals said that I was all good, but then mailed a second form with contradicting info(I believe a bribe may I gone down for this). Because of this my iq “became” 87 and I “had” ADHD. Take my word on this but I am not a hyperactive person. I don’t get distracted easily and can stay focused for long periods of time. Oh and there was one more thing. I was declared to have lost 80% of my hearing. 

Now the one thing that practically saved my life was another persons life. My forth grade teacher was pregnant. Now let my explain why this is was so so so so very important. My mom showed the “results” to the school and forced them to do a few things. One of them being something that I fear thinking about even to today. The FM trainer. It was a device that a teacher wore to send what they were saying directly to a single student ears. They were worse than hearing aids. Hearing aids can be conveniently hidden in your ears. These could not. They were bulky,  very noticeable and the device that the teacher wore was even worse. The student would have to carry it around to each class and give it to each teacher to wear. But luckily in forth grade I did not have to wear them. I was given good luck. My forth grade teacher refused to wear it because she believed it would hurt the baby. So I was saved, for the final quarter of forth grade. 

Fifth grade. The year where everything my mom fought for would be put into effect. So many things. Let’s make a list:
- All writing assignments would be done on the computer using a program called “Write Out Loud” which allowed you to hear back your writing. 
- All tests would be taken in a different room and 1.5x the amount of time. 
- For state tests I would not be allowed to bubble in the answer sheet, a teacher would, I would only circle in the book
- Occupational therapy (2 times a week)
- Phonetic and reading help classes( I would be pulled out of my class 3 times a week)
- A teacher would come in once a week to organize me
- I’m sure there is more but finally
- The FM trainer
Now let’s talk about the satanic hearing aids a bit. No one knew what they were. So even though they weren’t hearing aids, that’s what the other kids called them. Now the FM trainer was operated by me. I would go into the room where it was stored, put in the batteries, and hand the teacher the device. So if I didn’t hand the teacher the device things would be good, right? Wrong. A teacher who worked in the room would run out and give it to me. But I had another idea. Although it would be impossible for me to get out of wearing it, I could get out of hearing it. I didn’t have to put in the batteries. And this will be more important later. 

Now imagine being considered smart for two years, then suddenly being though of as the most retarded kid in the class. It confuses people. Which was a blessing. Everybody in my class knew it but no one outside of my class believed it. But I was still outcasted. No friends in that class except maybe 1 or 2. Everything about me was spread behind my back. You don’t make fun of the sped kid to his face. You do it behind his back. Thankfully I had two friends outside of my class and we called ourselves the “Rainbow Puppies”. I don’t know why we chose that name but it doesn’t matter. At a birthday party for one of them the other came up to me. He was one of the most popular kids in our grade but he enjoyed hanging out with us, so he did. He asked me if I wore hearing aids. And I said no. Then he asked to check my ears. I let him. This wasn’t school. So I didn’t have them. So he debunked all the rumors and things were peaceful for the rest of the year. And for his actions I am forever grateful. 

Now my fifth grade teacher was chill. She played devils advocate for both sides. So I got away with not putting in the batteries. She was also a weeb. She thought us how to fold cranes which we made a thousand of and sent to Japan and read books about Japan. All around a good teacher, but she traded away something that would have a greater effect in the future. 

I was best friends with someone we will call him, “6%” because that is the percentage my phone is at right now. Me and 6% were best friends since second grade when I moved to this school. I got into the gifted and talented program in third grade. He got in in forth. We friendly competed in academics. All of this will also be important later. 

My fifth grade teacher traded a lot of the stuff of my IEP for the math honors program. She thought I was able to do it but comprised with my mother to remove almost everything from that horrible list in exchange for me not taking that class. And like that I gained a lot, but what I lost wouldn’t have as much of an effect until later. 

Sixth Grade. 4.0 GPA. No FM trainer. Everything was good. Wrong. My parents were focused on me for the past 2 years, but forgot about someone else. My sister. By the time sixth grade came around for me, her depression was very bad and near the point of suicide.(I’m going to say now that she is fine and 1 million times better, so I’m going to leave most of her recovery out due to this being sooo long already)

Seventh Grade. I get into a new friend group with the people who play video games. We became good friends. 6% and I still hung out all the time. Grades are still amazing. Second quarter ends. It’s been 3 years since my first testing procedures in forth grade. Time for round two. 

This time my mom is more chill because my grades are higher and she destroyed her knee in skiing accident so she can’t take me to get tested even if she wanted to. So she let the school handle everything. Testing procedures get done. I get declared a genius in 3 different subcategories and have an iq high enough to get into Mensa(I don’t feel comfortable giving the number). 

I tell 6% about the iq results. Big mistake. He questions why I got to take it and not him. So I explain everything. Doesn’t believe me/won’t accept it as an answer. Friendship became very awkward for a little bit then we became friends again, just not as close. 

This scarred me. I stopped trying as hard in school. I would calculate how much effort needed to be put in in order to just make honor roll. Basically if I didn’t do my homework but still got A+s on test I would be fine. So that’s what I did. 

Sometime around this my personality changes. I matured. I became more aware of other people and started to understand how they worked. But, I couldn’t show that. I did for a few days without realizing it, then teachers asked what was wrong. So I said nothing and faked a very peppy and energetic personality ever since. (This doesn’t really bother me, it’s more of a second nature now). 

Eight grade. You remember those video game friends I made. Yeah. They’re gone. 
We were close over the summer and had a group where we would to random fun things during the school year, but my school schedule push me away from them. You know how in elementary school you had the same class for everything, well that’s pretty much how it was for us. The same 14 people in every class. This pushed me away from other outside of this group because no matter what this became my new major friend group whether I like it or not. 

Ninth grade. Leader of that group from last year moved. Group splits up. No friends. I test the waters a bit with the grading system to make sure my old way still works. It doesn’t. I get a C+ in English. My mom is very upset. Threatens to call school. I say it won’t happen. She talks to my teachers anyway. I fight fire with fire. Poor decision but I had a point to prove. I told her to back out and my grades will go up. She told me that’s not how it work, but said it in a tone like I’m a autistic 5 year old. I complete every. Single. Assignment. Show them to the teachers. Then don’t hand them in. Second quarter grades. Not the best either. Third quarter, teachers became aware of the pattern and inform my mother that I was not so disorganized that I was losing my completed work, but I was deliberately not handing it in. My mom backs out. I win. (Yes I am aware of how petty it was. We were both using underhanded tactics so I decide to stop the battle before it became a war)

Ever since then my mom never got involved and I’ve been doing fine. 

I didn’t explain about my dad. In the beginning(4th grade) we was against what my mom was doing, but became tired of arguments, so he joined her side. I don’t blame him for this I would do the same thing. 

I wrote this became I want to move on from it and not have to fear anytime I see someone from my fifth grade class.

31,"I started this job around June 2018. I work for a college, in the dining commons as a production chef, I make food. I make around $11/HR and work 40 hours 5 days a week straight, 3 to 12 p.m. most days, and its legitimate hell for me. 

I do not enjoy my job, the only benefit to my job is that I make nearly double what I need monthly for bills, the student workers are nice, and that because we are so underemployedits hard to get fired. I'm confined to one station, so my interaction with the other PCs is next to none. I only truly work with those in my station. All of whom, besides one, I think I genuinely hate. One never is in station, and abandons me and others frequently to do all the work 90% of the time. One is a massive asshole (and unfortunately the main one I work with at night) who struggles to accept my way of life, and consistently puts me down while doing minimal work. The last works mornings, so I rarely see her, but she is a compulsive liar and lazy, much like the  rest. This means work many times falls onto me, and the other worker, and it's broken me. Management is corrupt, and treats the workers like disposable garbage, letting the lazy prosper, and the ones who actually work sink. They make nearly $14/HR and do no work, sitting down, eating when they like, and generally being able to do as they want, when they want. All the while treating others like they're garbage and beneath them. 

There are some good parts, and not everyone, and every workday is horrible. The problem is that the grand majority of it is. Not to even mention how these problems flow into my personal life. I have next to no free time from this job, due to the 40 hr 5 days straight schedule. Which has extremely stunted my social life. Plus working 3 to 12 has my sleep schedule horrendous. At this point I only see the sun on my days off, and when I'm going to work. My diet has gone to crap, because of lack of time to cook proper meals. Which has manifested itself in bad skin, weight gain, etc. 

At this point I really cant help but feel, it's either keep this job and be stable financially, or quit and struggle with a minimum wage job. The odds lean towards me unfortunately staying where I'm at, and its killing me. So reddit, if you have any ideas on tips I can make it through this job without wanting to die on the daily, please give it. I need so much advice on whether this job really is worth the pain, and just tips to make my life easier. ",10Feb2019,1

It feels like that unrelenting pressure that's been pushing at my skull for so long (not physically mind you, I don't think I have a tumor) is just... Gone.

Maybe my hormones have balanced out. Who knows. But I haven't felt like this since I was a kid! It's just so much lighter, like I actually have energy to do things again. It's weird the level of deja vu pulling me back to my childhood trough this.

43,"Sorry for the incoherent narrative. It's a stream of consciousness post.

This is by no means the lowest point of my life. I'm 24, with a master's degree in psychology and working as a therapist in a fairly ethical, rigorous and challenging space. After two years completing my master's in another city with very little money, I'm now grateful that I'm not anxious about my money and I have a steady flow from a job that I enjoy going to. It's been nine months in my job. I live with my aunt, uncle and elder cousin, who I'm really close to because I don't have enough money to rent out my own place and my family thinks its wise for me to save. However, despite all of this newfound security, I feel trapped. I feel suffocated and I feel like I'm oppressed by the routine of it all and I long to breathe and leave. I often have dreams about running away.


My organization also caters to the wealthy and its services are really expensive. I could not imagine going there as a client. This is also a source of dissonance for me. Also, my family history has been really fucked up and complex and its challenges seem to never end. I feel like this job is great on paper and there's nothing wrong with it per se: but if I had to put it in words, I guess it would be that I have never had access to good mental healthcare and one of my personal goals was always to make sure that I created an environment where people could have access. This place seems to do good work but violate that principle entirely. 

I don't really want anything from this post, I guess. I just want to externalize this urge and tell someone that I didn't choose this life or this place even if it seems like I did. I want to stop myself to make sure I don't settle for a job or a life that feels half assed or this nagging feeling of ""something's wrong"" will never go away. I need to be able to trust this vague and amorphous nudge and actually make a change. Living a life for my own sake feels like an alien concept sometimes, and I often use other people needing me as an escape from actually pursuing what I need to do for me.

Like, where are we going as a society when we reserve things like driving, voting, smoking, owning a gun, and consenting to sex for either adults or people nearing adulthood (and understandably so), but when it comes down to something as life-altering as taking puberty blockers, well, before puberty, it's fair game? So if a kid comes home from school one day and wants to explore his feminine side or her masculine side, we're supposed to start giving them fucking drugs in an effort to prevent them to develop into mature adults? Kids don't know what's going on in the world before puberty and they're absolutely not ready to make a big call like that.

46,"As I lay in bed practically paralyzed, it feels yet again like another episode of sleep paralysis. Slowly my body continues to sink deeper into my bed and automatically, I get this sense of hopelessness. Stuck like glue, I can’t find my escape. Afraid to face my demons, I find comfort underneath the covers. I close my eyes to shut out the world, and hope somebody hears my silent cry for help. The void in my heart grows deeper by the minute and I start to lose all sense of reality. Why did I let it go this far? Underneath my breath I whisper to God to guide me out of this nightmare I somehow keep finding myself in. Suddenly the sheets I once felt safe in is now bringing me down like quick sand. Suffering has it now goes against me., here I am... trapped in a labyrinth consumed of good and evil. I am lost. Everything and by everything I mean my sanity feels like it has collapse on me, like a avalanche on the mountain probably from screaming in my mind.
As I travel much deeper within the realms of despair, my poor body begins to smother against the plain. As I am still unable to move, I feel this heavy pressure In my chest. Struggling to react to the chaos inside my mind,  The only thoughts I managed to gather was perhaps I’ve reach this whole new level of sorrow that I never knew was even possible. Or anyone of that matter. Just my luck, I’m forced to watch my life escape away through my pores, leaving me naked and vulnerable to the outside world. In disbelief, I lay there in silence as I lose every bit of my self. 
Once every ounce of my energy force that was keeping me sane eventually escapes within my grasp, I say goodbye forever as it evaporates into thin air, never being able to get it back..back inside my dying soul. 
Please why don’t you just make this pain go quickly. As the only good thing left in me fades away, slowly but surely everything seems to be heading from lack of conscience into feeling completely and utterly useless. 
My frozen body is exhausted. Still constantly feeling trapped within my own mind. All the suffering I was enduring led me to something. I cannot believe that there was a little beam of light hiding along the void in my heart. Yes that huge hole of emptiness that was eating away the purpose of my exsitence. And how amazed was I to find the light. What seems to be so close yet so far, was finger nails at reach. I manage to capture a small glimpse of all the possibilities God has laid out in front of me. I guess I wasn’t doomed after all. My cry for help was heard after all. Finally being able to move, I slowly unwrap myself from these sheets. Being once used as a shield, I let go of that comfort zone and took a leap of fate. Crawling my way out of bed, I leave a part of me behind there. Still not being close to overcome the darkness that’s laying within me, I continue to ride this wave of misery with a different perspective. As I fight to keep my head above this toxic water of negativity I clinge harder than ever to this gem. The gem with the glistening light that has woken up the hope inside of me.

53,"Never thought that would happen to me, but I think that is what I am experiencing right now. I keep regretting every decision I made in life and absolutely not sure of how fixing it or what to do next. 

I've been away from home living in a foreign country for more than 5 years, I do feel integrated in the culture more or less, made some strong friendships. Although, I do not feel like I belong here.  I can't stop thinking about moving back home. I miss my parents and I constantly feel homesick. However, whenever I am back, I feel like I have changed too much and I would have difficulty adapting to the culture back home again. I cut off most of the friendships I had in my home country and probably all I have left there is my family. And to be fair, I don't have a lot of interest in rebuilding them.

I am graduating in July and I have no clue what I want to do after. I do like the country I live in, but I don't like the city. I want to move away but have no idea where. I had a lot of creative spark and motivation to pursue career in creative industry, but now I don't know if it was the right decision. If I ever get a job, then most likely I would have to move somewhere, away from my friends and everything I have built here. That really terrifies me. I question if it's worth it, keep working your ass off, away from everyone, for that paycheque so you can pay your rent and bills. 

I regret my past relationships and focusing too much on them. Don't get me wrong, despite all bad things which have happened during my past relationships, I have learned a lot and loved so much that I didn't even know I that existed in me. However, at this point, almost half a year after my recent break up, I don't even know what kind of person is right for me or what do I want. I feel like I lost myself in my past relationships. Although, I miss that feeling of ""calmness"" when you're around someone special. I am not interested in casual hookups or just being around someone for the sake of being or actively searching for someone, but I also know that I'm not getting younger.  

So part of me still wants to be this career orientated woman, who doesn't need anyone, focusing on my goals and creativity. But other part of me just wants to have calm life, be closer to my family and maybe have my own at some point.

55,"Recently I’ve been dealing with an odd issue where I have extreme pain in my jaw/get terrible headaches when I talk for too long. I originally went to my GP doctor and dentist, they both had no idea, basically told me to eat ibuprofen and use heat, come back in a few days if it was still bothering me. 

I went back to both after having an odd episode of numbness in the left side of my mouth, which I knew could be a bad sign. The dentist referred me to an orthodontist who had absolutely no idea what it was, although he confirmed it wasn’t TMJ. My doctor said I might have a tonsilar abscess, although she admittted it was unlikely, but prescribed me antibiotics anyway.

As of yesterday it has been two weeks, and I still have a weird lack of control over the muscles in the left side of my face, and my jaw/head still hurt when I talk. I ended up using a friends Teladoc (online doctor consultation). The teladoc basically told me to go to urgent care immediately if I had numbness/lack of control in face muscles. The urgent care doctor refused to even see me, just told me to go to the ER ASAP.

So I spend 6.5 hours in the ER, do bloodwork and a cat scan, only for them to tell me there’s nothing wrong that they can see, and it’s probably a neuromuscular issue. They had 0 answers. They said it could be bell’s palsey, but if it was its the absolute mildest case they’ve ever seen so that probably wasn’t it. I think they just said it to make me feel better. 

On the way out I had to pay a $500 co-pay, and I can’t even imagine what the full bill will be like. On top of this I’m facing losing my job as I’m in sales, and I can barely talk for an hour without intense pain. 

I just feel so frustrated and let down by the healthcare system, and am utterly exhausted by all of this. I don’t know how I’m going to pay my bills when I can’t even do my job, and I’m not sure what to do now that I’ve been to 8 doctors and gotten absolutely no help.

57,"I dont know.



Im a guy, 22, in university, never been in a serious relationship and i have no idea of what im going to be doing in the next 5 years.


I basically wasted my teen years jerking off and playing video games, was 20kg / 45lb underweight, got into fights on a weekly basis and used to get rejected a ton because I just wanst attractive. The one thing that kept me away from depression and possibly turning into an incel, was that I always had this posture of fake confidence and positivity. Im not shy and can get a good, fun conversation out of anyone, so I can make new friends out of anyone pretty easily. But in a weird way, I always felt alone when I wasn't with my small group of geeky friends from highschool (whom actually progressed with theirs lifes and arent 2 or 3 years behind like me). Its like I have this weird gift of being easy to like, but I dont want to put effort in liking them back.



3 years ago, I started seeing myself stuck in life. No goals, no girlfriends and friends were moving on with their lifes. It was only then, I decided to turn my life around. I applied myself in school and finished highschool by 20. Then I worked minimum wage for a year to save up money for University and had my first girlfriend... I would be lying if I said that I didnt think about her today, but I am being honest when i say I dont want anything to do with her. This girl ended up using me as a rebound, told me I was a mistake and just really wasn't attractive for her. This marked the start of the darkest period in my life. University was about to start, by favorite aunt was diagnosed with a brain tumor, highly self concious about my body, still in love with a girl that had no real interest in me and was still feeling being left behind by everyone of my year. I went to a psychologist and she told me I was beginning to suffer from anxiety and that later could developt into depression.
Thankfully University started and i made a new group of friends. They don't know it, but they really helped me out getting through what I hope will be the toughest period of my life. I got the right motivation to eat and go to the gym. Today I'm at 185cm / 6'0 tall and weighting 80kg / 176 lb, with about 16% body fat. I still have issues with my body, mainly my face, but i am aware that im about 20kg better looking.
My grades are fine. I only have one class behind and its the hardest of the whole degree with only about 20% passing rate per year.
Dating wise its still a complete disaster. I dont like drinking alcohol, so i dont like hooking up on those parties where everyone gets wasted. My city isn't big and there arent many other ways of getting to know girls.


But thats the thing... I can see my life is way better then before, but its still not enough. Im not happy with it and I dont feel different although I know I am different.


 I want to decide what im going to do after my degree (its very versatile and I have a lot of choices on what to do with it).
I want to be more handsome.
I want to get a girlfriend. One that actualy loves me this time.

63,"It makes no sense but I can barely go an hour without assuming someone hates me. 

I’ll be getting ready to hangout with a friend, and I’ll be thinking. 
“They probably don’t even want to see me, this is going to be so awkward, I shouldn’t even go they don’t like me.” Even if they invited me. 

Then I’ll hangout with them and I’ll realize how much I care about them and how much they care about me (“I missed you” are the best words in the English language) and I’ll think how silly I was to ever doubt them. 

But then no more then 30 minutes later I’ll be back to thinking they hate me “they were probably just being nice” or if literally anything goes wrong, (like; I make a joke and they don’t laugh, there’s some awkward silence, I feel like I talked too much, or like I didn’t talk enough) I’ll think they want to take back any nice thing they said. 

And I know it’s nonsense, I know I’m being too sensitive/ too needy of validation, but there is only  one person in my life (besides my family) who I could say with certainty likes me and that’s because I’ve been friends with them since the 4th grade.  

It’s really annoying because I end up not hanging with my friends and then they probably think I’m avoiding them and I don’t know what to do.",10Feb2019,1

65,"Dear Dad,

I was born in 1992 and I'm glad for letting me to access the Internet since I was 4. You have surfed with me in the beginning, but I know it was because of the Internet being full of shocking links on the beginning. Thank you for showing me ICQ, IRC, WWW, FTP and Usenet. In 2003, I could go online without help of you, but only if you was at home. When I was 13, you have allowed me to have a MySpace account. When I was 17, finally I could go online without your consent and you bought me a Motorola Droid. I still miss that phone. Now, I have got a BlackBerry Key2 due to my love of physical keyboards on smartphones.

Thank you for letting me use the Internet when it was funner, happier and better place than it's now. As a result, unfortunately I'm addicted to it, but it was well worth it.

Love, A.",10Feb2019,1
66,"I remember my mom always telling me that i’m such a good boy not like my brother (which he did whatever he wanted and got us in a lot of trouble and he is more mentally healthy than myself)

I get anger and sadness attacks because of my relationship with myself, i tend to be angry at myself for being what i was and wasted years, i always put other people first other than myself and they still took advantage and that’s what pisses me off about myself, just woke up it’s 9:40 am and i’m crying in my bed all of a sudden, i can’t get to love and forgive myself, i’m angry 😪

And now because of that i tend to be selfish because i got enough of giving people everything, now everything is for myself and if you want a cookie you ask me for it, i’m not gonna offer it to you 

Fuck, i even did a handjob to a dude (im a male) when i was 8 because he insisted and me being the people pleaser that i was i did it, he didn’t force me to, if i would stood up for myself nothing would ever happened but fuck me, i was a people pleaser and i regret it so much

Because every single person alive is sending a message with their life.

And that message will always take one of two forms.

You will either be an example.

Or you will be a warning.

So which is it?

Are you living your life in a way that should be emulated?

Or in a way that should be avoided?

Good or bad, your life is a billboard on display for all to see.

And the message on that billboard sticks around long after you do.

We are the only ones responsible for the contents of that message.

And anybody can change their message.

Your past does not determine your future unless you let it.

The message of your life is completely up to you.

I don’t hope that I die, I just don’t care if I do and I am not concerned about how it will affect the people in my life. I will go through bits of anxiety and depression, but this doesn’t feel like that. I have not had any suicidal thoughts surrounding these feelings. I am happily married with kids, have a decent job that for the most part I enjoy, and am in decent physical shape. Just wondering what this thinking pattern is about and if anyone else has gone through it. ",10Feb2019,1
69,"I’m a college freshman currently in my 2nd semester. As someone with social anxiety, going into college in the beginning was obviously very scary, but I managed. In fact, I ended making great friends with people in my dorm. I went out of my comfort zone and did what I needed to not be lonely. It was great in the beginning, very unlike the previous 4 years of high school were it was a constant battle between sadness and loneliness

But as months went on, I settled in and while I was somewhat happy, I felt like something was missing. I think maybe I truly hadn’t found *my* people (I still haven’t), but I didn’t know how to found those people. I got slightly less happy as the months went on, and when I went home for winter break, I fell into possibly the lowest point in my life (and I’ve had many low points). I never felt so suicidal and depressed and practically hopeless ever in my life. It was bad, but I still had the hope of going back to college to fix it

It didn’t

I came back, but my old mind hadn’t really come back. My friends started going out less, so that meant many more lonely nights crying in my dorm. I still hung out with them inside and chilled, but doing that made me realize I want to find new people, even if some people in my friend groups are people I value *so very much*, and that I really care about them a lot.

That was a month ago, and to make matters worse, I am losing my 4 *closest friends* (and others) to fraternity and sorority rush, and I truly don’t know what to do. I just want to cry and cry and cry. These 18 are just me *fighting*, fighting to find some sort of lasting happiness. 

I don’t know why I keep fighting, especially now. Because college was supposed to save me from what high school was, but my worst fear of loneliness at college is slowly becoming true. I made some new friends in my dorm last night, but I don’t know if they’re right for me, and of course they’re people who live in my dorm. I want to find people who aren’t engineers, or just *more* people I vibe with.

I plan on seeing a therapist again (I did last semester), but I know that won’t save me, but I just don’t know what to do. I haven’t found a club that interests me yet, and while I continuing to search, my hope dwindles.

It makes me wonder if I even picked the right college. Yes, the college is great for my major, and it has great resources including  therapy, career services , etc. there are many people who go here so there has to be *somebody* I can vibe with. It’s just that this college has Greek life and parties so ingrained in the culture, and while I like to occasionally party and drink, doing it 24/7 is not me.",10Feb2019,1

I'd take it a bunch of large tupperware into the condiment aisle and start pouring all of the ketchup into one tupperware all of the mustard into another all of the mayonaisse into another etc. adnauseum until I can't take the suspense.

So, for the past month or so I’ve been going through a really bad breakup and had a really bad fall out. Everything was dragged out for a while and the way my ex handled things at the end was downright abusive now that I’ve spoken to therapists and the like. So naturally I’ve been upset and not feeling like myself. In that time I’ve been using this website to vent my thoughts and get how I feel out. Since I started that, this one guy on reddit somehow got my email address and began emailing me things like “your ex girlfriend moved on” sending me random screenshots of my Reddit posts.

This obviously creeped me the fuck out and led me to ask who the hell he was  how he got my email. He continued emailing me and eventually I had the police contact him and basically have him cease and desist. He emailed me again saying that I was creepy and obsessed(ironic considering he was emailing someone he didn’t know about a relationship or girl he’s never had lmao) and that he was only trying to help me, again ironic as I never requested any of his damn help. He then started saying weird shit that no one not connected to my ex would know, like that she deleted her social media due to being contacted by another Reddit stalker. This took me aback as that’s obviously really creepy. He also found my YouTube channel(tbf this one isn’t that hard) and started spamming that with creepy comments and dislikes.

82,"So yesterday my family and I were in a car accident. Our car was totaled it was a 2000 Subaru outback and the car we hit was a BMW not sure on year or type all I know that it was a BMW... Anyway we were heading down the highway into town and the BMW was coming off the exit they cut out in front of us and my boyfriend had no time to stop and we hit the drivers side of the BMW we were going about 35 mph (Middleton exit 25 and highway 44 if you want to Google exact location of the wreck). My 10 year old was sitting on the drivers side back seat I was passenger or shotgun we were all wearing seatbelts. The airbags were deployed. Two people seen the wreck and the police were called one woman was extremely nice and offered to let my daughter sit in her car until everything was taken care of we also had a dash cam that was recording. My boyfriend decided to get one because of the many close calls while driving in town with my disabled brother as what my boyfriend does for work is drive my brother where he wants to go through the week. Anyway the first thing that I did was went to my daughter and made sure she was ok she said her neck and back hurt I wasn't in any pain at the time but that doesn't really matter the driver of the BMW came up to me and just kept saying I'm so sorry I'm so sorry then she called her dad. Yeah not the police her daddy. One of the people that seen the wreck called the police. My daughter was crying and terrified and I was terrified a nice man that seen the entire wreck brought us a blanket because it was pretty windy but not extremely windy and cold the roads were dry and you could see perfectly fine because it was daytime it was cloudy but it was daytime.

Anyway what made me curious is that an ambulance didn't show up. Just 2 police officers (one was kind of a dick the other was pretty easy going) I thought if a child under driving age was involved in a car accident of that extent an ambulance or EMT was supposed to come to make sure they were safe.

We wound up having to take her to the ER make sure she was ok I wound up having to be checked out myself because they thought I had a fractured chest bone or whatever it's called and had to have x-rays. My daughter is fine she has a scratch with some bruising on her neck from the seatbelt I cannot express how happy I was when we knew she is going to be just fine.

86,"Hi there all. First things first - i'm not looking for any kind of attention neither do I care about that (that's why I made a new acc).   


Mid/late 2018 and 2019 (so far) are the worst periods in my life. Literally. If you care to give any advice, keep reading (if you want). If not, well, its up to you!

&amp;#x200B;

Somewhere in August 2018 I had a car accident where I could broke every bone in my body, or stay paralyzed. Only if my dad didn't gave the gas, i'd bee maybe in a hospital with broken bones or whatever. Who knows what could have happened. My parents had a big fights in like december for the first time EVER. (they've been together for 20+ years). Oh, i'm 18 btw, soon 19. I thought they were going to split up for NOTHING. Literally, n o t h i n g. But they got over it. 

 After that accident there were minor ones. Failed my driving test, etc..etc.. 

&amp;#x200B;

Starting 2019 was the worst. I got my Instagram page (20,000 followers) deleted. It was my only way of income. It really did start growing and getting more paid sponsorships (i was on my way to buy myself a phone, really, couple of paid ads and there. I have a new s8+). And then, it got deleted. Together with my MAIN/PRIVATE Instagram and facebook profile. FOR NO REASON. And i've been growing my Instagram page for like a year. (started in april 2018). Put a lot of time in it.   


And then, around 10th of january, my grandpa(dad's side) gets a stroke i believe and ends up in hospital. He is fine now (thank God). Got out couple of days ago, came home to his wife (my grandma), and TODAY at 2:30 AM my dad gets a call that says - she died of stroke. Literally out of blue. (if that's how you say it). She was well, fine, healthy and there. She doesn't exist no more. (i feel stupid for saying this, i really do, but it didn't hurt me that much as i thought it will, so it's a bit easier...).  


This thing is on my mind for a long time now... should I just end all this? Like, i had a lot of stuff happened to me that not even my parents, close friends knew about. Like 90% of my life nobody knows (and no, i'm not sad or depressed or anything, but i don't like talking that much).   


I feel like i reached a point in life where i don't even know what the fuck i'm doing. I'm finishing school in 2 months, have to go to college but i can't, i'm not qualified, so i have to find a work (it's usually 8-12 hours a day for $12 or less)... And I keep asking myself..... do i do it? But what's about my parents... What will they do/feel?

My mom is never happy, my dad is never happy, my siblings aren't. Is this just a product of my upbringing or is this just the way it is? You know? 

If anyone out there can say that they are very, truly happy with where they are right now, I would  like to hear your stories, maybe give me a boost of hope. 

Thanks to those of you who read, it means a lot.",10Feb2019,1
95,"Currently got the job I’ve always wanted but it no longer makes me happy, been feeling fairly depressed and tired of it the last couple months and I just don’t have the same urge to do it anymore. I think I might regret it slightly during times in the future but I just feel that I’ll continue being unhappy even if it pays well. I’ve not got many friends, girlfriend, or any major responsibilities so I think it’s best to do something I want to do, even if it upsets my family.

Would like to hear your opinions. Appreciate everyone that reads.",10Feb2019,1
96,"She lives there rent free with the kids on the proviso that my mum has someone there for her.  I would have thought she would have come home and stayed home to ensure she was ok and that she was ok in the morning also. She also didnt tell me anything about the fall, I found out after calling my mum the next day and then mum was in tears as she was home by herself (moreso that she missed everyone, but I feel she was upset as she was in pain - bruised up nothing major) but still.",10Feb2019,1
97,"I am still on payroll without working, the boss is a friend and is okay with that. Annual salary is 37K Canadian gross. With my wife's maternity benefits, it's enough to provide for my family of 5.

98,"Hey there. I’m an Indian teenager and I would like to share my story with you.

My whole life, my family only cared about my studies. Whenever I would go visit my cousins, the first question they asked is, “how are your studies?” Everyone wanted me to become a doctor when I was older just because of the money and prestige. I decided to forget about my dream of becoming a lawyer.

When I started high school, my whole family found out about a Vet school in India thats a 5 year program. They told me after high school they are going to send me there. I refused to go. They never recognized my passion for law and politics. Everything I do is just to satisfy them. My family began to tell me my dream of becoming a lawyer is a joke. I probably won’t even get into law school. But even then, I still refused to give into their vision of me going into vet school. I held on to my passion for law. After this criticism, my whole life began to revolve around school. I was always in my room studying away from everyone. I became obsessed with achieving my dreams one day. I told my family multiple times that vet school is not for me. They just wouldn’t listen to me. My aunt threatened to get me married off at 18 if I don’t go to the vet school. They even convinced my little siblings and cousins to become a veterinarian.

My whole childhood, I faced verbal and physical abuse. My parents and siblings called me stupid, lowlife, dumb, fat, useless, etc. The verbal abuse really affected my well being, even though I never showed it. Everyone in my family told me if I don’t study hard and get straight a’s, I will end up working a minimum wage job in the future. My parents and younger siblings even hit me for the pettiest things. They would grab random objects like bats, wooden and metal spoons, etc. and hit me with them. Even after this I still loved my family so much. I always put my parents and siblings before myself and always wanted the absolute best for them.

My family has even made me hate my own culture. As a sophomore in high school right now, I’m ashamed of my race. Growing up, my family treated women like servants. They were expected to cook and clean at a very young age. The men in my family always cussed at the women when they don’t get what they want. My mom always said when she was 15, she could cook for her whole family. I’m always criticized at a family function when someone asks if I can cook, and I say no. My family always said if I don’t know how to cook or clean no man is going to marry me. They are planning to have an arranged marriage for me. But, I’m absolutely not doing that. I’m going to find someone who treats me right. As a 15 year old, my family doesn’t let me be a kid. Whenever I hang with my little cousins, my grandpa says to go help my grandmas cook and clean. He says that doctors don’t play like little kids. But, he forgets a 15 year old is a kid. I learned that a lot of Indian families do this kind of stuff to women, so I vowed not to get married to an Indian guy. And I always hated being Indian and other Indians growing up. I know it’s wrong to hate every Indian, because some are different.

Sorry for the rant. I just needed to get this off my chest and I need support. I’ve never let their verbal and physical abuse get to me. I’ve always stayed true to myself and my dreams. I’m just going to have to learn and suffer until I leave for college. I’ve decided if they are going to continue to be controlling, I’m going to cut ties in the future",10Feb2019,1
100,"I'm 21. I've got the money and the willpower, but no courage to bring sadness to my mother. I've tried moving out once, with the context of a big fight in my home, and it worked out alright... until I had a psychotic breaked caused by weed. Then I was put in a psych ward, and after that, I went to my mother's house once more.

I really need a space for myself. My current home has too many bad memories, and I know they'll come with me, but I know it'll be different than what it is today, for example. I want to live alone. I enjoy my loneliness and want to sink into it, with maybe 2 or 3 close friends and my SO.

I always tell myself I'm going to talk to my mother in a month or two, then I postpone it again and again. 

I feel guilty because the money comes from my father's alimony - after the divorce, it was arranged that he should pay me and my sister until we're 24. I'm trying to get a job.",10Feb2019,1
101,"This seemed great at first. I knew that there were at least two people in my school that had romantic feelings for me. I was able to find out who they were through a bet that I won with a different friend. The other two confessed to me throughout the past 3 days. Let me rub all of them down for you. (Not using real names in case they find this post (they can all recognize me from the way I type easily.))

The first one who approached me was a good friend of mine, let’s call him Phil. Phil was one of my first friends in high school. He’s a great guy; funny, shares a lot of my same interests, and is really kind towards everyone he meets.

The next one is the one I found out through the bet, let’s call her Roxanne. She’s also a good friend of mine, not quite to the extent of Phil, but she was one of the first few friends I made in high school. She also shares a lot of my interests, and she’s really cool to hang out with.

The third one was the one I never expected. Let’s call him Dave. Now Dave has been my best friend for the last three years, and I had no idea he had a crush on me. According to him, I was the one who made him question his sexuality (I knew that he didn’t think he was straight, but I didn’t think it was me who caused to be confused.) Now, I already told him that I didn’t feel the same way, and he was totally okay with that.

Finally, the one that came last night, let’s call her Joanne. She texted me at 11:30 last night asking me to be her Valentine. I’ve known her for as long as I’ve known Dave, but we were never as close. In fact, Dave had a crush on her for 2 years. We technically dated before, but we never really talked about it afterwards and just kinda forgot about it. There’s nothing awkward about it anymore, but just thought it was worth mentioning.

Both Phil and Joanne have asked me out. Phil on Thursday and Joanne last night. I have no idea what to do here. What do you all recommend I do in this situation? I’ve never had anyone express romantic feelings for me until this week. What do I do?

Thank you all so much.",10Feb2019,1
