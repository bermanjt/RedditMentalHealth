(I’m 20 btw, just so you can get an idea of how rare that is) anyway, recently I haven’t been able to call my parents due to this buildings shitty signal reception thing so I use FaceTime instead. Whenever I FaceTime I’ve been noticing my teeth r surprisingly white (I’ve always struggled with yellow teeth even tho I’ve always taken care of my teeth) when I first saw em I was like “damn this this lighting is really good” but it kept happening so guess it wasn’t the lighting.",02Jun2019,1

4,This year I had two people ask me out we will call them Shawn and Cameron.  I've known Cameron for about three years and I only met Shawn a few months ago. I hardly talked to Cameron this whole school year but I talked to Shawn weekly. Cameron and I got shipped a lot because we were 'nerds' it made me very uncomfortable and I told my friend to stop doing this multiple times but she didn't. It got worse when Cameron asked me out. We hardly talked and I wouldn't even consider myself friends with him. He did it anyway and to no surprise I rejected him. My friends was jokingly mad at me for rejecting him. And we both would get teased about it. It made me more uncomfortable. With Shawn on the other hand he didn't make it a big deal unlike Cameron. He told his friend to ask me for him in Science. I said no and that was that. I told one friend and that was it. I can still be friends with Shawn I just can't with Cameron because it is awkward because one of our friends ALWAYS brings it up. People hardly know that Shawn asked me out. So I think that I can say that ask someone out when you are friends with them first. You will still have the back bone of your friendship and if they were your true friend they would still hangout with you. And don't make a big deal about it. Sometimes it makes the other person uncomfortable. This is just my experience and I just wanted to vent.,02Jun2019,0

12,"I’ve been watching him consistently when I come home from school and even during school since he posts content on YouTube. I respect and like him a lot.

He plays Super Mario Maker, and today he was playing levels submitted by viewers, but people who have subbed to his Twitch channel get priority over regular viewers. I knew this, and didn’t mind waiting since I like watching him anyway.

I submitted my level at 11:06, and he just ended his stream about 20 minutes ago (8:00).

I waited 9 hours for him to play my level, and he didn’t. The most depressing and frustrating part about it is that I was next, but he already decided that he would end his stream at 8. Another thing that bothers me about it is that my level is very easy (you literally can’t die) and it’s 30 seconds. 

I waited 9 hours to enjoy 30 seconds of the stream. This just irritates me and makes me sad. I want to cry and break every single thing of value near me. I know it shouldn’t matter to me this much, but that was fucking crushing. So close yet so far away. Now I would have to wait another week but there is still no guarantee that he’ll get to my level.

18,"Sometimes, as I am falling asleep, I hear a voice (of no one in particular) scream at me, jolting me awake. I was very worried and mentioned it to a friend and my sibling, who were both creeped out by my description. After extensive research, I found that this is called a hypnagogic hallucination. It is experienced as someone is about to enter unconscious, and can involve vision, smell, taste, sound or tactile sensation. I only remember my hallucinations vaguely, but they always feel very real at the time. I experience them quite rarely, mainly during times of stress and in depressive episodes. However, the last one scared me enough to keep me awake for most of the night. I also hallucinated a feeling, that of my wrists rolling around without my control. The screams are always directed at me and may include my name. This condition is more common in females than males, usually starts in adolescence and happens to a person less often as they grow older. Hypnagogic hallucinations are sometimes associated with the sleep disorder narcolepsy. 

I wanted to put this information out there just in case someone is going through something similar and doesn't know how to handle it, or is worrying that they are mentally ill. It's apparently quite common, but I had never heard of it before. Here's the best site I found on hypnagogic hallucinations: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321070.php",02Jun2019,56

My engineering days are almost over and there is this small get together (dinner) arranged by one of my faculty members and I was invited too along with three of my friends. I was really a hard-working guy and from the previous year's course project, she (that faculty) start to know me. So during my final year, me and one of my friend who btw got an invite too for the dinner were offered to conduct a workshop for my juniors and which went well.

So during dinner, I realised something about myself. Though I was there but I felt some part of me was missing. I was lost in that moment. I couldn't crack a joke or get completely indulge in the conversation like the way all my friends were doing. I was not comfortable. I was acting like a shy person or a 10-year-old child. It felt I lacked some connection with the host. All of my other friends know her as much as I do but still, I felt like am sitting with a bunch of strangers. Maybe I lack the confidence to talk with people independently. I just don't know what happened? But one thing I am sure about I lacked the sense of individuality that everyone else had in that room.

21,"I'd like to preface this with the fact that I have no reason to ""attack"" anyone. My only mission in life, as an engineer, and as a fellow human being, is to make sure that Earth not only stays around, but is a place where future generations can live comfortably and happily.

My only hope is that people remain well informed and caring of each other. Money is very powerful, and people who have money don't like to admit that they're wrong. Knowledge is power, and getting information from multiple sources is very important, as a single source can easily skew information to their own agendas, or even lack of a different viewpoint. Group projects work better than when you're alone, right? Because other people have ideas, too, and sometimes those ideas are better?

Energy is very important to humans, now more than ever. As our world grows ever more connected, it is important for us to constantly maintain power, mainly through electricity. Our current methods of power work, but they aren't the best. Since when have we ever had something complicated that is ""the best"" immediately? Never. Technology improves, and with it, our lives improve.

Our current forms of energy are having adverse effects on our planet. This is undeniable. Our planet is dying, and we only get one chance. Can we terraform Mars? Yes. But it will cost quadrillions of dollars, and possibly thousands of years. Realistically, we only have one chance to exist as a species, and that chance is on Earth.

I have no agenda, I don't want anybody to hate me. I'm not getting paid to say any of this. I just want everyone to live their best life possible, and to die knowing that my children, their children, and everyone after them, have a place to live freely and happily.


[WIND ENERGY IS DESIGNED TO REMAIN SUSTAINABLE EVEN WHEN IT ISN'T WINDY](https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/frequently-asked-questions-about-wind-energy#ElectricitySupply)

You mentioned that wind turbines don't always work because it isn't always windy. This is a quote from Donald Trump that I recognized. Energy doesn't really work that way. Energy is stored and dispersed as necessary, not used on the spot.

I'm not very familiar with this topic, as I never heard of it before you brought up. But now that I read a little more into this, I see that Mars is indeed heating up. After thousands of years, Mars's poles have tilted farther than normal, which causes the ice caps to melt, and therefore raising the average temperature of the planet. This is not what is occurring on Earth...

27,"Somehow I drove past that Chick Fil A *six* times today. 

Woke up, ran 7 (6.89…) miles. Solid 7 miles. Took off well, running on at a solid pace, not wavering much. Then, happened on a big event in downtown. The Powerboat Nationals were going on. Watched them drive? A few laps of a race and then ran on. After the break though, I was a *ton* slower. By like, a minute-ish/mile pace slower. I don’t know how, I was still feeling pretty solid, just extra slow for some reason. Someone whistled at me at a red light at one point? Looked almost like Emily, so idk how to feel about that lol. I didn’t bring my headphones or phone with me, which was nice. Just a nice shirtless run. A touch of sunburn but I’ll live. For the last mile or so, everything was salty. I was so thirsty. At a point, my mouth just tasted like straight seawater. Nasty. Got back to the car, turned on Lyft and headed over towards CFA, thinking I might get a ride somewhere in there, but no luck. I pulled into the lot, saw her car, and nope-ed right outta there, and went to the next one. Idk what’s wrong with me. I still don’t feel good. I got to the next CFA, and got a spicy sandwich, no pickles of course, and large fry and large Mello Yellow with light ice. That drink was absolutely amazing, so tasty. I was so thirsty. Got home, and first thing I did was step on the scale. I had sweated a lot. Naked, I weighed in at 172.1. I had lost about 5 pounds during the run. Pretty wild. Who'da thunk. Couldn’t really eat though. Not sure what it was. Just not much of an appetite. But boy I sure drank a lot. Just relaxed most of the day. 

Boyfriend. Who’da thunk. Why do I feel like … what do I feel?

I relaxed until around 7. Then, went a did a couple of my Lyft laps. I’ve been driving down a few exits, then up Kingston Pike to downtown, back on 40 down a bunch of exits, and then rinse and repeat. Did two laps, then tried to hit DGB. Asked for Elizabeth, apparently she wasn’t there for some reason, something about her boyfriend maybe? Hostess suggested I sit at the bar, no thanks. Got back in the car and went back on Lyft, got taken past Turkey Creek. Hit McDonald’s, Came home. Texted Grace again, trying to see if she wanted to meet tomorrow. Finally heard back, “i appreciate you asking but I’m really not interested in that. plus, my boyfriend wouldn’t like that.” Why does that make me like… sick to my stomach. What in the actual fuck is wrong with me? I just told her sorry. I just wanna die. I’m not gonna be able to sleep again tonight. Maybe a double thing of ZZZQuil. Mom said I should go to church tomorrow, might get me grounded. We’ll see. I just want to break down right now. I don’t even know what that means. Sob maybe. I still miss her. And Elizabeth some. I’m sad I missed her last night at the bar. It was gonna be fun, just me alone at a table in her section, kinda like new old times. She’s like a good, old friend to me now, more or less. I want to text and tell her I’m sorry I missed her, but I don’t want to push any more. I don’t want to do much of anything any more. The only thing keeping me going right now is running and waiting to hear back from Gallmeier I guess. The bad thoughts keep flooding in, more than ever before. But like, what if something didn’t work. What if I *did* ram that car coming the other way head-on, but I just got a concussion and totaled the car? I’d be much worse off than now. I’m on Tinder. Have been for a week-ish now. Nothing. How is that possible? Honestly? What the fuck? I could just use some affirmation of some kind. The run today was good, until I got so slow. 

I think I just feel unwanted, unloved. I haven’t been happy, honestly happy, in about a month. I miss that. I miss joy. I feel like such a pussy. It’s been a little bit of a rough month, most of which I’ve done to myself, and I’m all down in the dumps. I can’t even be unhappy right. 

I feel like I need a good hug, like a long one. Got one from Elizabeth, but it didn’t feel right, especially after she said she had a boyfriend. Like I need to be held. Just held for a bit. Maybe I need to just sit in the shower and try and cry it out. Idk. For now, maybe some ZZZQuil and an attempt at bed.",02Jun2019,1

I haven't been out for about two weeks. I almost don't have food here.. but I don't feel like I need it. I'm not hungry anymore.
Sometimes I just feel like this.. lately a bit more often. I don't want anybody to know or even ask what's going on. I want to be here, not moving anywhere and just simply sleep and lie down on my couch or bed. I don't even remember when I took a shower last time, but at least I don't have to. From time to time I have strange thoughts. Maybe not that strange... They're feeling normal, just some people would say otherwise.
""Nobody really wants to see me, nobody likes me at all. For what I should go to my university? I'm not going to pass exams anyway. When I'm outside my house everybody looks at me like I'm weird or ugly. I don't want these looks at me... I'm staying here again today.""

Meanwhile her friends are meeting, talking, living their lifes like nothing is happening, like they don't know at all who she is. They aren't giving any attention to the fact they haven't met her for such a long time.
But maybe it's not really like this? Maybe somebody cares? Maybe this person just doesn't want to share thoughts? Nobody knows. At least nobody who would say it out loud. Why is that like this?

At around sophomore year of HS I got contacts and I did have trouble seeing at that point. I had to squint to be able to see the projector. When I went into the military I had a in depth vision test because I was DQ for my astigmatism. Turns out my vision can only be corrected to 20/25 but even then, the doctor lied for me. He was worried I wouldn’t get the waiver and he started giving me “hints” as to what was on the screen. Which is why I got the 20/25 in reality it’s worse than 20/25. 

Fast forward a few months and one day I took off my classes. Before I could walk around and be fine, I could see everything just things far away were a little blurry but when I took off my classes I noticed everything was a little more blurry.

As I was leaving the area where the situation occurred a friend was already waiting for me and the moment I saw his knowing face I just lost it and couldn’t hold my emotions. He held me, let me cry and comforted me. It was such a pure moment of friendship and love that I’m still taken aback thinking about it, hours later and much calmer and moving forward.

58,"Hello all! I am a 22F and I have been wondering about this for a while and I was wondering about your thoughts on this. I think it's easy for us to tell our friends and our loved ones that we think they are beautiful and show support for other people in their journey to an improved self-image. There is a lot of resources and support for people to see beauty in themselves and I believe that this is all wonderful and amazing. Despite everyone and their mother telling each other that they are beautiful, isn't it possible that one could be objectively ugly? I know it's hard to say because beauty and our judgment of another's appearance is inherently subjective, but if we observe qualitatively that the general mass of a given population views certain attributes as beautiful and desirable, and someone has all the opposite of those traits, can we conclude that this person is ugly?

I ask because I believe that I am, by this definition, very ugly. I appreciate that my friends and family are always trying to be supportive of me and tell me that I am beautiful, but no matter what, I know when I look in the mirror that I am not beautiful by any standard (even across different countries and their beauty standards). Since I was younger, I've been told I was ugly and was severely made fun of for it until the end of high school. College is certainly less vicious so I didn't experience it there, but even so I could tell that people saw it in me. People always say ""you're just comparing yourself to models; they are not realistic; that's only a small percentage,"" etc., but even compared to the people all around me, I am considerably ugly. Even when it came to relationships, I've only ever been asked out by two guys and they both cheated on me with someone much more beautiful. One guy I liked said that he likes A, B and C about my personality, but that he didn't want to settle for someone like me. The fact of the matter is people can tell you that you're beautiful, but they will never *treat* you like you're beautiful.

Perhaps this question serves no relevance to anyone, and maybe there's no point in this question being answered at all. I ask more out of curiosity of what other people think, and also for my peace of mind. No amount of makeup, photo filters, or working out will change the fact that my body shape is simply unflattering, and that makeup cannot hide the shape of my eyes, nose, or lips. Perhaps if I hear what you all have to say, I can come to terms with the fact that I am ""objectively"" ugly, and move on without the glimmer of hope that I will ever be seen as beautiful. Sorry if this seems like such a downer, but please let me know your thoughts! Thank you!",02Jun2019,2

65,"Confused if the persons in your life are toxic? 

This might help. If you can’t tell if someone in your life is a toxic narcissist, here are some little things to help you remember in the heat of the moment: 

-Narcissists love to never be wrong. If someone cannot level with you when you express your feelings about a shared issue, that is your first little red flag. 

-Toxic people believe so hard in their agenda that they will fight and bully you emotionally until you succumb to what they want. Even if that means going against your better judgment. 

-Toxic Narcissists LOVE to be the victim. They will abuse you and then say you drove them to it. Do not let them rewrite your reality. Hold strong to the facts and hold your ground. 


I understand that every abuse case is different. 
There are complexities to where generalized advice doesn’t always apply but ONE thing remains the same: FACTS. 

Get your facts. Get your proof. Become a mountain strong-hold that doesn’t allow enemies to penetrate through and insert doubt.

A lot of woman, when they are young, have flings with these guys who are hot and sexually desirable. They are physically attracted to them.

Then after they've had their fun, they settle with a guy who is not as physically attractive but that they have emotions for. He's going to be essentially her glorified friend. A familial dud that is safe and can be tamed unlike the unreliable or unpredictable Chad.

But honestly, I'd rather have zero emotional attraction and pure physical attraction. As a man, I need sex to feel love. I also don't want forced sex either.

It's no wonder that SO MANY couples have dead bedrooms. Woman settles with guys they don't have real sexual interest in. They also give that bullshit excuse of how ""she's not a sexual person anymore"". Bullshit.

She will do anal with a Chad in a club bathroom but won't do anything sexually exciting with her beta bux boyfriend/husband.

You just end up feeling like a loser as a man in this day and age.

My second relationship was a lot better. He wasn't a bad guy but wasn't able to handle emotional conversations. He would say ""I don't know"" at most or sometimes even have an outburst and yell the same phrase even louder. So I stopped telling him about my issues because I didn't want to make things hard for anyone. He eventually broke up with me because he said he didn't want me to be the only girl he's ever dated and he couldn't handle something so serious.

When I say issues, it wasn't anything huge, more the fact that if I wanted to vent a little about a bad day at work or if something that happened in the friend group upset me.

Because of these experiences I'm terrified of talking about my problems because I feel like I'm an inconvenience and I just don't want to be a burden.

Fast forward a little, I'm dating a guy at the moment and have been for three months who is really lovely. He's rather introverted (as am I) and we have the same interests and get along really well.  A month in he noticed I was a bit sad but I wasn't saying anything to which he said ""You know you can vent to me right?"" And I told him I understood but was just scared to be a burden. 

Two weeks ago I was incredibly upset about something because my ex had sent me a rather hurtful message. The guy I'm seeing came over immediately and told me ""I'm always here for you if you ever need someone to listen."" I didn't go into too much detail about the situation but I told him the gist of it and ended up apologising more about being a burden. He ended up holding me for a while and told me that I was never a burden to him.

Tonight I was crying because of the same drama that happened two weeks ago. I was a bit sick of it and just wanted to not be involved anymore. Again, he asked ""Do you want to talk about it with me? I'm here for you and it's okay."" 

And for the first time in so long I ended up telling someone about my problems. I only apologised once which is better than apologising profusely. I also explained why I was so scared to vent about my problems and I was crying so much but he just hugged me and told me ""You haven't pushed me away, I'm still here and you don't have to be scared.""

79,"# TL;DR:

Went on a festival with the intent of getting drunk and fooling around with my buddies, wasn't planning on hooking up with anybody because I am pretty shy and would rather avoid it. One of their female friends chatted with me, and even though I was pretty drunk, making a fool of myself, dressing up like an idiot and dancing around awkwardly to techno music, she asks to go see the last shows of the night together. Didn't try hitting on her because I was unsure what her intent was, but instead stuck to my initial plan of just enjoying the festival and going the ""safe"" road. On the one hand I had a great evening and tons of fun, but on the other hand I feel like I missed out on hooking up with her. In the end I am probably mostly just getting fed up with my social incompetence in some situations though!

Just wanted to write it down, so there's not really a proper question hidden somewhere, I'd love to hear some opinions on this though :)

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if the title is a bit confusing, I am terrible with finding right ones haha.

So I was on a festival with my friends (\~15 people) for the past days, and we basically did exactly what we planned: Drinking a lot of alcohol and not giving a shit about what others might think (And obviously listening to some acts!). I am somewhat embarrassed about Friday, since I was one of the \~8 people who were **very drunk** and had to throw up. Yes, I know we might have taken our plan too seriously, but that's what it is! I wasn't the drunkest person (Somebody else puked in his tent and continued to pee on our campsite, directed to us and with closed eyes), but I was still quite a bit embarrassed.

Anyways, the next day I didn't drink any alcohol until the evening (I had an upset stomach, and also a girl near our camp happened to be a nurse and told me to take it easy for the moment). So I was ""just"" hungover for the moment and didn't really do shit or embarrass myself, which gave me time to chat with some of the female friends of my friends. I never intended to hit on anyone during the festival since I am a rather introverted and pretty shy person, so we mainly just chatted. I continued to chat with one of them throughout the evening, and eventually started getting drunk. At some point I decided to just make a fool of myself and follow the initial plan again, I found some pole I decided to stick beer cans on (people started calling me Gandalf), used a caution tape with taped on glow sticks as necklace, etc. You get the point I guess. My friends, her and me continued to wander off to other camping sites and found some nice people we danced with until 3-4 a.m. 

At that point I thought nobody would even be slightly interested in interacting with me since I was quite majorly drunk and didn't stop doing stupid stuff. Around 3:30 a.m the girl mentioned earlier asked if her and me wanted to go on the festival area for some of the last acts though, to which I didn't say no since there was still some good music running (mainly Techno though). We wandered off, got something to eat, chatted, went to the act, danced a bit and went back to the others eventually. I wasn't really able to tell if she was interested in me or not, because - I didn't mention this yet - *I was never in a relationship and basically have zero experience with this stuff*. It kind of felt that way, but my brain told me that it most likely can't be the case because of my behavior. Don't get me wrong, I was always being very nice to everybody. I just looked like a fool with my clothes and especially the caution tape, and probably looked ridiculous dancing to the techno music that was running. I was having a great time just hanging out with her though, so I guessed why not just stick to that! Everybody ended up going to bed at around 6 a.m and we didn't talk that much afterwards.

I think this was way too detailed and most of you (In case anybody even reads it in the first place lol) will only read the TL;DR but I didn't want to cut out some details I thought might be interesting. In the end I probably only wrote this down because I feel like I missed out on actually hooking up with someone for the first time. Because I'm normally pretty restrained, shy and a bit socially awkward I don't get a lot of chances at this stuff in the first place, and I usually don't follow up the ones that I do get. This starts getting to me more and more lately!  On the other hand I thought it was a really fun evening, and I am glad I just didn't kill the positive vibes!

Thanks for reading in case you read the whole thing or the TL;DR :D",02Jun2019,1
80,"Today I wore a certain pretty dress for the first time, and noticed that I don’t look the same in it as when I bought it last year, since I’ve gained weight. *VBO alert!* (Visible Belly Outline) As soon as I walked in the door of our spiritual center I received several compliments on it and on how pretty I look in it, and I said thank you and mentioned that I especially appreciate the compliments because not worrying about having a VBO is a newish thing for me.

There’s one woman who’s been coming to our center for a while who is an absolute boundary stomper, verbally, physically and energetically. She’s loud, she’s aggressive, she’s nosy, she jumps into peoples’ conversations and business and is very controlling. If we weren’t such a small, new place I’d be able to avoid her, but that’s been difficult since we only average about 8 people a Sunday so far. (So technically I don’t “have to” deal with her, I could choose not to go, but I love the place, my husband is on the board, and the minister is having me sing every Sunday.)

So anyway, she just happened to be sitting nearby as I was explaining about my working on body neutrality (and ideally, eventually body acceptance.) I smooth down my dress, which makes my belly more prominent — and *she slaps my hands away* and says “DON’T DO THAT!” as she tries to explain that the way the dress hangs, you can’t really see my belly. 

SO not the point, SO inappropriate, and *none of her f***ing business!*

I actually had a therapy session a few weeks ago where I talked about her for a while, and decided that the next time she overstepped I was going to have a conversation with her. After the service I asked her if we could talk and pointed to the back room, her eyes got wide but she followed me. I told her that I’m very uncomfortable with her and today was the last straw, and, using “I statements”, explained my perception of what happened today. (It wasn’t just my perception, the two other women who I was actually talking with about the dress interpreted her behavior exactly the same way and also saw it as being completely inappropriate.) At first she said she didn’t do that, and I reiterated that *in my experience* that’s EXACTLY what happened, then she said she didn’t mean to do that, she was just trying to help me — then I just interrupted her and said I understand you weren’t “trying to”, but I experience you as generally being invasive, inappropriate, and very much a boundary stomper, and I want you to stay out of my business from now on, indefinitely. Don’t talk to me, don’t interact with me, *just stay away from me.*

THIS IS HUGE FOR ME! I’ve been in therapy on and off for a long time to work on healing my past and being able to set healthy boundaries for myself, and I especially don’t want aggressive, emotionally invasive people touching me without my permission!

I was shaking afterwards and felt kind of bad about how aggressive *I* was, because I don’t like being that way (I hadn’t planned to be when I rehearsed my speech, but when I started I went into an altered state.) When I spoke to the two other women about it they said that was probably necessary, that she probably wouldn’t have even really registered it if I hadn’t been.

And the irony? Our minister was gone this Sunday, she’s a minister herself so he asked her to do the talk, and it was all about this technique she shared with us that helped her stop being so invasive and controlling! 😳🤣",02Jun2019,3

83,"M,

You are very good. I like you very much and I enjoy the hell out of your presence so much?? It was really nice with you and L and biking around and making food and making A's thing and visiting her. And Sally. Your dad was right to love the hell out of your water chicken. 

Anyway, that was the best day I have lived in a long time. I don't really know how to convey the deeper feelings behind that... That was a lovely high point on this emotional rollercoaster. You are such a pleasant lovely adorable competent person. Currently laying my head on minivan window. ^(The imitation muscovite is warm. It does *not* smell like cheezit casserole)

There are cotton tufts up in the sky to the north, lazily following gulf wind patterns. I'm not nearly to Austin yet, but the east Texas forests and the transition to scrub and rolling hills makes for such pleasant scenery. It's kinda hazy out. Bright, hazy, a little bit surreal. 

I definitely understand feeling distant from people because of their politics. I met today with S and J, and while it was mostly fine, it reiterated the feeling that it is a reflection of their internal character. Almost even moreso with S, she performs this political apathy (""wait, what's the difference between capitalism and socialism?""). It comes off to me as a lack of passion and empathy about the world, which I *viscerally* despise. I do think you were right that I tie my mental state to such events out of my control in a way that is slightly unhealthy. Perhaps I'm subconsciously making up for the pervasive selfish ""i-got-mine-fuck-you""-ism that's woven into the American flag. Wondering if there's a way I can communicate that attitude to others without being an obnoxious shit. Or maybe you're right that I should be more sympathetic to other ideologies, but I've done an excellent job of talking myself into the idea that they hurt millions of people and such sympathy shouldn't be intended for this neoconservative hegemony. 

I've repressed a lot of thoughts about me doing bad things in the past. Do I even have the right to do that? I'm not the one who felt their effects. God I've been awful. I largely rewrote my personality around the second half of Junior year (started happening sophomore year), and I hope it's done away with the majority of that, but little fragments of shittiness (better username for this account lmao) remain and pop up and I need to be better. I think I've done okay most of the time about that, but I fail sometimes.

RE: changes in my person:

I remember one time you asked me if I saw my past self as a guy or as a girl, and I remember that question getting lost in chat logs. I've considered this question a lot. I don't know if I have an answer for myself, truthfully. I feel like I expressed guy aspects from my [last name], and I sorta identified with [deadname]. I didn't despise some of that, and I'm really struggling to separate out [deadname] from [last name] and trying to reconcile that with my identity as a transwoman, some of that has me feeling vaguely non-binary, but idk labels suck and alienate people and I don't even know. So I guess to answer your question, I expressed male traits of [lastname] along with some additional that I'd manufactured, for [deadname]. You understand well that I experience gender really performatively, so i do sorta view my past self as boy (with dysphoria). Do not know whatever the hell this current performance is...???? Am [lastname]person. That is the perspective from which I exist. (Mia mulder is an internet person with very similar experiences in a similar position, she good) God it'd be easier if my dysphoria was shittier. Actually no, that sounds like hell. 

Eh I do kinda like you. But it's a very pleasant background unattached ""M is good"" feeling that just exists as casual ""meh"". Also, what the hell is my sexual/romantic attraction? Yours honestly sounds really similar with like everything slightly flipped, but kinda not. What is thaat? God there are not enough well accepted adjectives in the English language to describe having feelings in the 21st century. I'm a free spirit person. Very feelings. Much wow. Wow. Yes.  

You are competent as hell and I like you much better than I like myself, you deserve a lot. I can guarantee fuck all with your future and college and stuff, but I am confident that worrying about it distances you from apathia and yeahhh umm have you heard of Jordan Peterson? I've heard he has a book about heirarchies and lobsters to cure you of your student activism. You should look forward to my essay on the destruction of the nuclear family: Lobsters, Anarchism, and Polyamory; Weird Sentences to Drop Around C$ and More.[1] I guess I'm bad at being direct, I am confident you will find happiness wherever you end up. You did so much cool shit in high school and you've achieved the title of brettlich, and i think you're substantiating that position. I am hella excited for you this fall, but oh god oh lord please manage your time well and remember yourself. You miiiight research sleep habits that are good and the role of sleep in mood and memory and everything and ack please be nice to [southern anglicized J-pronounced version of your name]

I am beginning to see the tops of buildings downtown, coming in from the southeast. Trees got shorter and I'm feeling very free right now. [Insert The Story of an Hour imagery].

His name is pepito, he is the love of my life, is my rock, he is everything. My family rejected me because of stupid reasons but he always loved me unconditionally, he was always here for me and he's always happy to see me come home.

Honestly, I've been through some rough shit. I hate myself and I hate my life but he is my light, I know to you, it's just a cat but to me, he is my best friend, my family, the furry love of my life. 

But he is sick and I need help. I've managed to get some help from an association that helps pets, I'm using my credit cards to make his treatment affordable but it's still not enough. I need £500 to afford his treatment.

If you can please contribute, share or donate to the GFM, I'd be very grateful. You can read the full story in his fundraiser.

85,"Hey guys, I'm pretty pissed. I filled out an online application and printed it out so that I could bring it to the grocery store near my house and discuss getting a part-time summer job there. I waited at the customer service desk for about 20 minutes until a cashier lady told me to sit down at one of the tables near the entrance and wait to talk to someone. I did this for about an hour and a half, half way through of which the lady walked into a room and never came back out again. At the end of this hour and a half, I was starting to wonder if the lady forgot or never told anybody, so I went back to the customer service desk, which now had someone there. He was a very nice man, and I told him that I was told to wait a while ago. He said that he didn't know why she would tell me to wait because they don't have a job counselor to talk to at the establishment. He then looked over my application and told me that I was not yet old enough to get the position I applied for. He was very apologetic, but as I was walking back home, boy was I angry. First of all, this whole thing could've been much faster if someone just told me that right off the bat. Second of all, I could've spent all of this time studying for finals happening this week (which I have now done). That's all, I just wanted to vent a bit. Thanks for reading",02Jun2019,7

88,"So I'm a teenager. 16 years old. Everytime I'm in public and see a girl my age, literally people I don't know, I find myself checking my hair and making sure to be standing/sitting up straight. It's like I'm constantly trying to get a girlfriend wherever I am, and that everyone I see is a possibility. 

I freaking hate that. I don't know if people will know what I mean, but I *want* a girlfriend, but at the same time I don't. Part of me wants it, but another part tells me no. 

The reason I don't want a girlfriend is because I feel it to be unnecessary at this age. I know that's an unpopular opinion, but with my personal beliefs I don't think you should date just to date. If you do, that's all you my man, but it's not my thing. I'd only ever want to date someone who I could see actually having a future with. I'm not saying I'd only date someone if I'd marry them, but I'm not going to date someone who I know I'd never want to marry, or even just be together for a while. 

And especially because I don't plan on staying where I am. When I get out of highschool, I'm going to go and stay with family in a different state and go to college there. If I have a girlfriend here that I actually like, I'd have to break up. I'd rather not have to do that. Because not everyone wants to pick up and leave from their hometown. And I definitely couldn't do a long distance relationship like that. 

Which makes it just so annoying. Because my teenage mind and hormones tell me differently, and it's just ridiculous. Because I know it isn't smart, and that it's just not worth it. But at the same time, maybe it is. Maybe I find someone who I do want to be together with for as long as it works. But I dunno. Maybe I'm over thinking things. But it's constantly nagging at me, so I had to say it to someone, even if it is just internet strangers.",02Jun2019,6

The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",02Jun2019,0

Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

94,"I worked two jobs and studied full time for MONTHS. I changed my diet to a vegetarian diet, I started working out at least 3 times a week, getting good rest, I sobered up tremendously, passed all my classes with at least a B despite being exhausted, Ive been saving money, eating out less, and started caring about fashion.

I bent over backwards to make sure it was at a time during the sunset and on a day he said he didn’t have plans on. They got approved for the discount when originally it’s mandatory I have to be there. They made an exception for my father.
