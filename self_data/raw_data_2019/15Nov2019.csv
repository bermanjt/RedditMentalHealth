0,I live on the east coast currently while my entire family is in the Seattle area. I currently work at target and I’ve been feeling so damn over worked and abused. I get one day off a week and no one at work cares. This has been the toughest week since moving out here in the sense that we’re gearing up for Christmas and on top of that I found out my mom is having surgery the day before Thanksgiving. My mom had breast cancer in her left breast and they’re doing a prophylactic surgery for the right one.   I just don’t know what to do. I’m tired and frustrated.,15Nov2019,1

8,"Why is it always my fault for everything going wrong. It certainly isn't my fault that I've pulled so many all nighters that  i physically can't fucking do any more problems.

Why is it that so many others are depressed and complaining about engineering at uni, even killing themselves sometimes about the work load, which is impossible to keep up with, and despite all that, it's always the students fault.

I'm first year, but if so many people are getting burnout, getting sick, depressed, sometimes dying, why is the student always to blame for failing or doing poorly?

I'm sorry I'm a fucking disappointment alright? Maybe they should make it more manageable gor others instead unless they want me to commit suicide, which they do.

Now that I’m across the country my friends rarely reach out to me. I almost always text and call first. Even in my romantic relationship. And it’s exhausting. It feels like nobody cares about me enough to reach out. I know that they do, but it’s still hard. 

I don’t want to be the only one putting in effort to maintain my relationships. It’s not fair. oh well",15Nov2019,1

I'm 23M who has never had a committed relationship in my entire life.  I don't have like any female friends so idk who to go to here.  Last week I started seeing this Girl A.  First connection I've ever had and we get along well and it looks like we're heading towards a relationship.  Well tonight an old co-worker (2years) texts me and asks to go for drinks. Lets call her Girl B, now 2 years ago Girl B was engaged to a guy and she hasn't texted me a single time since we stopped being co-workers, so her texting me feels very...off?  I never was and am not romantically interested in Girl B but I did like her as a friend and would feel bad to just ignore her. 

My question is what do you all think Girl B's intentions are and how's should I handle this situation?  And how you all think Girl A would feel about all this, should I talk to her about it?",15Nov2019,1

Idk but now at the age of 24, I'm tired. I'm so Fucking tired of having someone in my space. I've jumped from relationship to relationship for years and I've stayed in these relationships weather I was happy or not, just so I didn't have to be alone. I finally just want to be by myself... But it's a little harder than expected. I've come to the conclusion that I need a hobby and I plan on getting a few as soon as I start my new job... 2020 is all about me and MY happiness.

23,"I travelled abroad and started university in 2015, but ended up failing my first semester. Immediately that happened I told my parents and promised to do better, they were a little angry at first cause they expected better from me (being the first child and all).

I felt pressured to prove I could do better, but I just kept failing. I passed some courses but didn't get the scores I imagined I will get and when my parents asked I got too scared to tell them the truth, I told them I was getting either a B or C but never and A and they always believed me. (I never told them my GPA.)

Last year, I registered for classes as usual and was put on a waiting list. After that I decided to take time off school for a year, I don't know why but I did, but my family still thought I was going to school.

This year I had to renew my student visa and I had to meet a counsellor who told me it would be hard for me to renew due to the year I took time off. I was terrified of what would happen to me if my parents ever found out, then she gave me the business card of someone who could help me and he helped cause I was able to renew my visa. (But it was extremely expensive, more expensive than what had to be paid for renewal)

My Parents started calling asking for things for graduation... Things I didn't know. I had to check online and make sure I knew everything and I mean everything

Now my dad just called asking for my GPA and I am scared to tell him the truth so I just made something up.

I think He and My Mum think something is up because they keep asking if everything is okay with me or if I have something to tell them

I am too scared to because I fell like I have betrayed their expectation of me and they will feel disappointed in me",15Nov2019,1

I am currently applying to PhD programs as a first-generation college student.

I have come to appreciate both fields as beautiful and endless possibilities for me to learn from and maybe someday make contributions to. I have been doing research in my laboratory for over a year now, and I am currently diving into Machine Learning (Deep Learning in particular) so that I can get started on another project.

32,"So my mom has just been diagnosed with a sack of water on her brain, I have anxiety and I feel like that is stopping me from being as helpful as I can be.

My dad is taking a hit on his economy and I really wish I could help but I don’t have that kind of money either so I just help in what I can but I’ve literally just got paid and I feel like my money is already flying away, my dad also talks a lot about money and how much everything cost so it’s not really helping me.

I know everything will be okay, but I wish I could be more helpful.

I feel so selfish but I really wish they treated me like a kid and leave me a bit in the dark, I’m so stressed out, my anxiety has never been worse and I feel like my brain is gone most of the time.

I’m not sure how to explain it, but I feel like I’m  shutting down, I can’t think about what’s happening in my life or I’ll have a mental breakdown, actually, I don’t really think that much anymore, I bet my coworkers think I’m dumb as hell.

I feel like I could be left alone in a room staring at a wall and I’ll stay there for a long time with no problem. I’m kind of surprised a car hasn’t ran over me yet on my way to work.

33,"I've been single since 2009 when I broke up with my ex after 18 months. We spent 15 months of that relationship on third base. At first, she didn't want to have sex before marriage because of her Christian beliefs, but later it was me that didn't want to. She is kind of messed up as described here https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c9wh0a/i_29m_am_in_love_with_a_girl_who_i_think_has_bpd/ and I felt when we have sex for the first time, I wanted to be more in love with her than I ever was before, which never ended up happening. Ever since I was like 12, I've always wanted my first time to be special and share it with someone I'm truly in love with. Since then, I've gone to third base with two other girls. Both were drunken party situations, and I stopped it from going further because even hammered, I knew that wasn't how I wanted my first time to go.

This Tuesday, I was feeling really lonely/horny, and decided to go to a strip club. It was pretty dead, and there were only two dancers working. When I sat down with a drink, one of them came up to me and started making conversation. I didn't consider this genuine flirting, I know it's their job and they do it to all the customers, but I was fine with that. I enjoyed our conversation, even though I knew it was a fake paid for transaction. I even bought a private show from her which I'm pretty sure she got closer than she normally does, and lasted longer. Towards the end of the night, and after a few drinks, I thought what the hell. I straight up asked for her number and if we could go on a real date. To my shock, she said yes.

Today, we met for coffee, grabbed dinner at a restaurant, then went for a walk down town. It was fun, and I think we both had a good time. The two of us kind of just clicked personality wise. I told her how shocked I was she gave me her number, and how I'm sure she gets hit on all the time at her job. She said she rarely gives it, but she just really enjoyed talking to me that night and she thought she'd enjoy seeing me again. I also found out she isn't from here, and is only in town for about month. Apparently, dancers travel all across the country to perform. I invited her over to dinner at my place on Saturday, and she said yes, and implied we could fuck if I wanted to.

The thing is, I have no idea what to do. I know I might be taking sex and my first time too seriously, or maybe I'm not. It's a shitty situation being a virgin at my age, and this might actually be a good thing. I know it would be weird to go through that with a new partner at my age, and this way I'll at least have some experience. Obviously this isn't going to be a lasting relationship, as she's only here for a month.

Any advice or opinions are welcome as I still have no idea what I'm going to do. At least this whole thing is a HUGE boost to my ego, which is certainly helpful, as my depression has been bad lately. I'd been starting to doubt if any woman besides my ex would ever find me attractive, and actually getting a date with a stripper, something I'm sure a lot of guys try to do and very few succeed at really ups my confidence.",15Nov2019,1

37,"Hey everyone,

I'm currently a Master's student, and my classes finish for the quarter after the first week of December. I won't be visiting home for the holidays this year. 

I want to stay healthy, productive, and happy. I currently go to the gym 4-5 days a week and eat well. I spend most of my time programming and writing, both solitary activities that don't rely too much on other people. 

I'm afraid the loneliness and isolation is going to get to me. I guess I'm also afraid I won't find other people to hang out with because everyone will be on vacation/break. 

What should I do to prepare?",15Nov2019,1
38,"I still don't know how to feel. 

Years of us going back and forth, lying, cheating, controlling behavior, emotional abuse, you name it it happened between us. Through it all I loved him, not always well but I tried. 

Now it's finally done. He thinks I cheated, I didn't. I still gave up my boundaries to appease his anger. I allowed myself to be used and emotionally battered because i thought I deserved it for betraying him by talking to someone else. Nothing sexual, just a few texts a day. He took it the wrong way. But today I couldn't take him yelling at me again, this time over his behavior causing drama at my workplace. 

So it's over. Hopefully for good. We've broken up before but this time I really hope it's final. I still love him deeply, I will always miss him but we were so toxic. I really truly hope we become better people now. I really hope I can stay strong. 

Never ignore your gut feeling on a relationship, trust when your friends collectively tell you someone is bad for you, and hard as it is walk away when you can. Stop fighting for something hurting both of you. 

I'm gonna cry some more now.  

I don't wanna move on. I just want to be happy.

39,"I had a really bad week, so I cried. I have been struggling with self hate and depression for the past 2 years, and I can't stop myself to cut last night. I was about to cry myself to sleep, but then it hits me hard. I always try to be kind to everyone, but I've been mean to myself this whole time.

I've been caling myself names I wouldn't say to anyone else; stupid, ugly, worthless. I hurt the only body that contains me my whole life, just because I hate myself. I didn't took a good care of myself for as long as I remember.

So last night, I make myself soup in the middle of the night. Put a warm blanket on myself, then I said sorry to myself. Sorry for being mean, sorry for calling you names. You have been there  for me my whole life, sorry for every bad thing I've done to you, self.  I will try to love you more.",15Nov2019,1
40,"So many people immediately choose to brush off my beliefs as impossible and a joke. I believe that all religions have truth, but no religion contains all of the truth. I believe that there is a higher power and all religions lead to it. Everybody finds “God” or whatever they choose to call it in different ways and places, but it all ultimately leads back to the same thing. Humans have branched off in so many ways since the beginning of our time that I think we all have part of the story right. All the different cultures likely changed the story in ways, but I think we all still are looking at the same thing but in different views.

It’s been hard for me to find anybody who believes in the same ideas that I do. It gets hard living with a family of dedicated Christians who i cannot open up to with my beliefs. They would just be so worried about me and try and “fix” me. I’m just looking for a group of people who have the same beliefs as me. I honestly feel really alone when it comes to my religious journey.

I’ve done research in all of the major religions and I see so much good in all of them. Some religions I believe in more than others, but I still believe strongly in all of them. Religion is so fascinating to me and I am still searching for the complete answer even though the answer is out of humanities reach.",15Nov2019,1
41,"Its really hard to feel like your worth existing when everything around you is telling you your worthless.  Jobs, schools, people who are supposedly my friends, they’ve all told me loud and clear that I am not worth their time. I’ve applied to hundreds if not thousands of jobs since getting out of high school, and in total I have had 2 places call me. I have applied for everything from an engineering intern to an entry level welder, to a data analyst, to working in a fast food joint and just about everything in between.  If I thought that I could do the job and not get fired within the first week, then I applied for the jobs. I have a couple of email accounts that are used solely for job applications and their inboxes are full of application confirmations and the subsequent rejections. How am I not getting a single call? Is it my name? Is it the font of my resume? I ask these questions because it can’t be that I’m simply not qualified for these jobs. I know this because I have applied for a welding job and was rejected, and later I find out that a dude I know got the job instead, the thing is he doesn’t know how to fucking weld! I on the other hand have a few years experience and can do just about any of the most common welding procedures. So apparently being qualified for the job hasn’t got a fucking thing to do with who gets hired. Every application I do and get rejected on is just another instance where the universe is telling me I’m worthless at best, and actually much more like a parasite leaching off my parents. My dad’s solution; move to Fresno where my uncle says he can get me a job easily. A few problems with that; If I move anywhere, I’d much rather it be out of this hellhole of a state. And lets say I do move, now I’m living in a room half the size of my current one, which is already getting small for me, I’ll have next to no internet access, which for a gamer is a pretty big deal, Id be in a place where I know nobody except my family who I do love but they have busy lives of their own and honestly we’re pretty different in terms of our interests. “Well you’ll make friends out there” how?! I can’t even make friends here with people I’ve known for over 20 fucking years. I mean I’m lonely and miserable now but who’s to say it can’t get worse, cause if life has taught me anything its that things can always get worse. No matter how hard you try, no matter if you try to do the right thing, no matter how close life has pushed you to the edge, the world can always make it all ten times worse. 

I fucking hate this time of year. For other people it’s the holidays, getting to see family, and all that mushy bullshit. For me Its rejection letters from schools, it not being able to find a job to apply to because no one really hires during the holidays, it’s getting to tell my extended family that nope, nothing has improved one bit, I’m still that massive failure from last year. It’s a birthday reminding me that I’m getting even older and yet my situation is almost the same to when I graduated from high school 8 years ago. Except back then I had a few friends, I had a plan for my future, and I had hope.  Well now all that has gone right down the fucking drain. I’ve got no plan whatsoever; I’ve got no hope because life has made it perfectly clear that that is a worthless attribute for me to have and its much better to just get used living every day wishing you had died years ago.  I knew school was gonna be hard, that it was gonna take a lot of effort, but fuck me I never thought that just getting into a single school would be harder than all my calculus classes combined.  And once I finally did get into a school, well it the school you only applied to just in case no one else wanted you. “well, I’ll go there and finish this degree” what a fucking joke. No you’ll go there be miserable, be stuck in a dorm hall with a bunch of fucking children, you’ll fail multiple classes no matter how hard you study, you’ll have your gallbladder fill with stones causing you the worst pain you’ve ever experienced on a daily, and to top it all off you’ll flunk out to really drive home how worthless you are. And the people at the school who are supposed to be there to help you? Good fucking luck with that, they’re not there to help. What are they there for? Who the fuck knows. Schools aren’t there to teach you stuff, they’re there to drain you pockets and make you conform to their standardized tests that only see how good you are at memorizing and not actually understanding the concept and turn out people who know little more than how to bubble in an answer.  And you do all this so you can get that little piece of paper that lets people know that you’ve well and truly been wrung through the system.",15Nov2019,1

44,"I’ve been in a committed relationship for almost 3 years now. My boyfriend is really good to me, however we haven’t actually talked about marriage or our future together. Whenever I try to bring it up, it’s always ""we’re not ready for that yet"", or ""it’s just a bad time to think about that right now"", or ""maybe we will some day"". We have very different work schedules and really only have time to see each other on weekends. I spend a lot of time by myself, and often feel lonely. I try not to express this too much, because it just makes both of us upset, and it’s not his fault our schedules are so different.

Recently, I have become pretty good friends with this guy. My boyfriend knows about him and nothing has happened that I feel I would have to keep a secret. However, I’ve started to develop a bit of a crush on him. He’s really funny, so nice, and super sweet. My boyfriend has never said or done anything to make me feel bad about myself, but something about the way this guy treats me just makes me feel really good about myself. I really like how straightforward he is with everything, which is something my boyfriend struggles with. We have the same sense of humor and joke around with each other a lot. Sometimes he jokingly tells me to hit him up if I’m ever single, but I’m not completely certain it’s a joke. I feel really comfortable around him, and genuinely enjoy his company.

Now, I’m not sure if I actually like him, or if I’m just looking for specific qualities in him that my boyfriend doesn’t have. Our relationship has kind of gotten stagnant and I feel like maybe I’m just looking for attention somewhere else because of the lack of attention I'm receiving at home, and because of the uncertainty about our future together. I feel kind of guilty, even though I haven’t done anything wrong, like in a way I’m cheating. But I also don’t want to end my friendship with this guy, because I’ve been kinda lonely and I have a lot of fun when I’m with him. I’m worried that since my boyfriend avoids talking about our future, maybe I am wasting my time with him. But I also don’t want to end a good three year relationship due to a simple crush, that I don’t even know is reciprocated. Overall I’m just really confused about my feelings and don’t know what to do.",15Nov2019,1

53,"First of all, it’s pretty whack that they don’t even let you have the option to choose this feature or not. I would have picked NO. But whatever, I’m one of the lucky ones who got chosen to test this feature by force.

Apparently Instagram’s goal is to make itself the “safest place on the internet” by removing likes so people don’t feel bad in comparison to people with popular content.

It’s completely pointless though: If you get more than 1000 likes on a photo, it will still say “[username] and thousands of others liked this photo.”

If you get less than 1000, it will just say a measly “[username] and others liked this photo.”

So popular Instagrammers still get to stand out and have clout and show off that they have more likes than anyone? Also companies / ads get this distinction too. How does this solve anything? There wasn’t even really a problem that needed solving in the first place.

Not only that, but Instagram is far from being “the safest place on the internet” and it’s not because of likes. I’ve seen murder videos, Nazi propaganda, animal abuse...

55,"I share this to hold myself accountable. 

I have a weird relationship with food. I stuff my face until I feel physically sick from all the sugar and fat, and then sometimes overtrain and restrict calories excessively in order to not gain weight. Food is my save haven when feeling stressed (school, work, personal). And when I reach to food, I don’t know my limits - or rather, I know my limits but consciously and willingly ignore them until I feeling like vomiting.

I am at a „healthy weight“ at the moment, fluctuating a few kg/lbs, nothing too dramatic. I would still like to lose a few pounds, but this is not my priority. Mainly, I want to develop a healthy relationship with food. I might look fairly healthy, but I surely am not on the inside. 

A few things about me: 
- early 20‘s 
- student / working part-time
- vegan 
- history of depression and anxiety (who doesn’t nowadays...); maybe autistic, maybe bipolar. I haven’t been diagnosed, but we discussed it in therapy before I stopped going.
- 5‘6“/168cm 
- 145lbs/66kg (fluctuating: 140-155lbs/64-70kg)

Why I want to share this: 
- Food is fuel. Food is not a sanctuary. Food can be medicine, and poison. We choose what we do to our bodies. I tell this myself all the time. I just never choose to believe it. 
- I feel physically sick from consciously and willingly overeating, 4-6 days a week. I feel tired but my heart is racing. Training feels terrible.
- I need to function. I can’t waste hours everyday wondering what I should eat and what I should do to compensate. I shouldn’t worry about hiding my foods in my drawers so my boyfriend doesn’t find them. 
- I know what it is like to feel healthy. I can’t wrap my head around why I can’t reach this anymore. 
- I have a victim mentality. I want to change that. I will take charge from now on. 

I am addicted. I have thrown away the healthy meal I prepared to make myself a giant bowl of pasta. I ate a jar of almond butter. 

I use MyFitnessPal and I usually track everything. I don’t track when these things happen. I am just going to guess I ate 500kcal of pasta (150g), 400kcal of sauce (450g), 1000kcal of almond butter (150g), 400 kcal of bread (6 slices). That’s 2300kcal. I had my normal breakfast and snack (400kcal together) before this urge to eat overcame me. 

I usually eat around 1600kcal everyday. I want to stick to that. I will stick to that. I will share my journey, maybe not daily, but regularly, to keep myself accountable. I will be 100% honest, like writing a diary. I won’t start tomorrow. I am starting right now.

Today was the last day I lost control.

56,"The first name I was born with felt like a burden. I mainly heard it in a venomous tone by my parents and quickly resented my name. 

My middle name was my Mom’s name, who I do not consider as family. Although she wasn’t as abusive as my dad, she still neglected me and caused me to feel like a stranger in my own family. Which brings me to my last name. 

I’m the black sheep of the family. I don’t feel connected to my family. I didn’t feel like I was living up to the name, not in a negative way, but in a way that I felt like I didn’t belong. I am not them. I do not want that name associated with me. 

With the weight of my full name, I decided enough was enough. I need something that speaks to me, something that I can proudly wear as a symbol of this new life I am creating for myself.

61,"*tldr at the bottom* 

 Growing out of a pessimistic mindset has certainly been a journey. 

 Ever since I was young I've been pretty negative. My childhood wasn't the worst nor the best, and so naturally that's just what happened. It didn't occur to me until last year that my negativity was why I had so much trouble making or keeping friends. It also attracted the wrong people to me. Once I was told this directly I couldn't stop thinking about it. I've always been a sensitive person too and not too receptive to constructive criticism until recently. 

 So I did my best to change it and I started with talking less and listening more. I chose my words carefully and really thought before just spewing what was on my mind, which could've been negative. Eventually the less I talked like that, I began to think better and therefore speak better. That led me to have better self esteem. I still have my moments, but I keep it to myself or only tell those I'm very close to about it. If I do that, I try to steer the conversation towards a solution instead of a dead end rant and just being upset. If there's no solution I'll just stay zen to the best of my ability and accept that it'll be alright. 

 So I hope that anyone reading this who also struggles with their mindset being negative or having low self esteem can take something from this. Or if it's just relatable in another way. I took it day by day and paid attention. It wasn't easy and took time, but it just takes some dedication and patience. I think I've changed for the better, including for those around me. 

💛tldr- I've always been pessimistic and had low self esteem. Someone was forward about it and for the next year I dedicated myself to change, it's worked, and I'm happy so I shared.",15Nov2019,1

i cant keep on living this way. its just so shit. i want to have an extraordinary life man, u dig???? U DIIIIG???

im tired of seeing other people rubbing their lives in my face, on the web. i dont even have social media, cuz i know people are going to f me up, like they're so judgemental towards me, i've always been bullied for no reason, im not anymore cuz i've learned how to defend myself, but i still feel this fucked up attitude towards me. like forreal people act like they dont care about me, and they kinda dont, but then they try to bring me down in every possible way. I want to use social media, but that fear or whatever it is, is fucking me up, and another reason to why i dont post is cringe, like literally everyone makes it so cringey, thinking that they're different, artistic and beautiful. like i know this gonna sound like bullshit, but i've not met a person in my life that can top me. But i want to express myself, cuz this pussy ass niggers be underestimating me, when they should be bowing down bruh. like im so tired of having this though EVERY FUCKING DAY. I know i started to talk about social media, but thats not the only problem, tho i'll say couple of more words about it: see, i know that everyone wants to be special and shit, but i am, tho i cant express it. cuz i know i aint gonna have no followers, despite being well known, or good looking. so i feel so shit because of that. thats why i want to do something special to my life, thats going to make people notice me. but im saying some global level shit, small shit dont interest me. Like its weird how people treat me. they constantly are trying to ridicule me, like i always end up catching their attention without even saying a word, (even tho im kinda loud) but they at the same time dont care about me. Like my previous close friends stopped caring about me. dont know why? literally, they stopped hitting me up, if i didnt call them or something, they didnt even remember that i existed. i've been hella lonely these past 2 years, tho these been the years ive grown and learned the most, but its suffocating, the days i've missed, sitting at home, not going out, cuz those dickheads didn't want me around anymore, and i didnt have anyone else at that time. i sometimes end up crying, cuz im kinda wasting my time. i make music, im really really really really really really creative and artistic, i can make it, but i havent yet found anyone with the same interests, i cant do it alone. no one knows that arts interest me, im at college studyying something completely different from music. but yea again i know it ssounds corny, but i dont want to be just another drop in ocean, u know? i want something to happen, i want to blow up, and have the fame and followin i've always wanted. this is my first year at college, im 18, boi, at first, i liked it here. became popular, tho i still didn't have the courage to have social media profiles (yes im obssessed with having it cuz i feel like im not a complete human being with it, i want to share my interests, taste with others, i want to express  my beauty, but im scared of people ignoring it), but then, the same shit happened, as with my school friends, who stopped hitting me up. there's something that im doing wrong, i dont know what is it. people aren't attracted to me. i cant be like this. like im funny and shit, but i stop beiing that way i after certain amount of time, like i hate it when im not the only one with the attention in the room, and i try to be louder and  bring others down. cuz im scared that people will forget me. Like no one cares about me here anymore, i mean they are intersted in me, but they dont initiate conversations, almost as if they're angry with me or they'll lose a bet with someone or something like that. LIke i dont want to have a wedding, if the whole world won't know about it, i dont want to exist if i wont be known, ( im not suicidal, i will keep on grinding tho), i reject doing certain everyday activities cuz it makes me look like other, i want to stick out, and i want others to see it.

72,"I entered community college directly out of high school because my parents didn't make much money and I qualified for a grant.  The government fully covers my tuition.  I decided a year in that I didn't like my major so I changed it to something else I wasn't sure I'd like.  Another year of that and I decide I don't really like it, I'm going to try the trades.  I started a roofing apprenticeship and while I wasn't bad at it, I absolutely hated it.  I then opted for a more forgiving trade, electrician.  I did that for two weeks before I quit and decided to go back to school yet again.  

And now here I am going to school for IT, another thing I just chose so people wouldn't think I'm a loser who can't get a job.  I'm 23 now with nothing to show for it.  I have a wonderful girlfriend who is college educated and I fear that if I quit again she will lose faith that I'll ever amount to anything.  

My motivation to perform in school is sacked.  I think about this all day.  I constantly run through my head thinking I wish I was born 60 years ago so I could just get a factory job and support a family.  I just don't know what to do.  I'm running into the same desire to quit that i've had time and time again.  I know I don't want to work in IT, but what am I going to tell everyone this time?  That I'm quitting college AGAIN?  That I constantly think to myself how stupid I must be that I can't even get an associates degree?

And when I come to put pen to paper, or type, I lose track. It's a distraction itself. 
But I had a strong emotional reaction, whilst driving, and thinking about how I'm not good enough. I'd been in the office at work and feel like I can't do the job. Making phone calls, bringing people up on stuff: is it too minor? Does it need to be highlighted? For the process it does, but probably not the person. Am I doing it right? Is there a right way? Is my tone coming across as superior? Smug? Know-it-all? Am I being offensive? 
So I'd had a tough day in the office, frustrated anyway by that role because the company seems so unstructured and not providing appropriate resources. And not fitting in with the other office staff. But then I just feel atm I'm not fitting in with people. 
This job is a lot of responsibility, and not much guidance, and I don't have the confidence to do that right now. But do I have the confidence, or do I want, to change my job? Go back to working in a pub? I know I was good at that in my own style, I knew I could do it. 
But it's a backwards step. And it's monotonous. And it's just as frustrating and lacking in resources and stressful in different ways. 

I'm so fed up of all the negative thoughts. And I'm more aware I'm beating myself up now, and it makes it worse because it's another thing I see as a negative trait. And it's the negative trait that contributed to ruining my relationship. 
And I can't talk to him about it. Because he's had enough. I've used up his patience with me. I never could talk to him about it though, he has his own problems but he chooses to ignore it all. 
Why can't I ignore? 
Why do I so readily entertain my self-deprecating comments? 

And then it's ""so makes sense him looking elsewhere, falling for someone else. She had issues, but different ones that he thought he could help."" and that hurts. He thought he could help her, but not me. And I did that, I made him think he couldn't help me and didn't help me. But my oh my did he help, I may have been default downer but I didn't think this badly of myself when I had him. I felt like I didn't deserve him, but my head was just quiet. Not beating myself up in high-intensity doses. 
How am I meant to change this thought pattern? 

I know I was told to not beat myself up for falling into the cycle, the comfort zone, the repeated thought process that is a habit now. It's the go-to, it's the autopilot. 

But I'm sad. Angry. Annoyed. I want to cry but it won't come because I'm working. My mouth is watering. My throat feels tight. My eyes are warm and wetter. My eyes are heavy and tired. My stomach is knotted. 
When I think about how bad my head is about myself. 
I can't even see what's good around me. Or trust what's good around me. Improving my self-awareness makes it worse, thinking about thinking, I glean some understanding, but is is meant to get worse before it gets better? 

I lost him over all this shit mess of me. 
But he wasn't the one for me anyway. Clearly. 
But I still want him in my life.

I go to university to learn math and chemistry, and while chemistry is my main focus in life (I also do home chemistry experiments as a hobby), I have noticed that many females attending this university have very cute faces that are pleasurable to look at. In my observation most females have cute faces. I rarely see ugly females.

I know it is an unspoken rule among humans that if you think a face is cute, you can look at it for extended periods of time by engaging in recreational face-to-face conversations, and if you just want to look at each others faces but you dont know what to talk about, you engage in small talk about easily accessible topics such as movies, weather, and schoolwork. By frequent smiling, laughing, and use of many facial expressions, humans show that this is recreational socialization and not a serious discussion.

However I dont care to do this, because I am focused on chemistry .and dont want to invest in social pleasures because I was circumcised as birth, which I think is a way to rob males of maximum social euphoria by destroying natural beauty of human body. So I get most euphoria from chemistry, and try not to focus on social pleasure. That means I'm not visually presentable for recreational socialization. But still, I have noticed very cute female faces, and I can only take quick glances, since it is creepy to look at a cute face without simultaneously talking to the human. I think cute female faces are a side pleasure to go Along with my chemistry pleasures.

I usually just look at pictures of cute female faces on the internet and stored on my computer. Today while walking between classes, I recognized a very cute female face that I had seen in a class last semester. I wanted to look, but I avoid looking for longer than 1 second to avoid looking like disturbed individual.

What you did was not ok. At our previous appointment you made it clear that I would need to see a specialist for testing because your hands were tied by our medical system. 



I took a month to prepare for this appointment. I documented my symptoms. I identified what specialist I needed for the most concerning symptoms and what testing I needed from each one. I triple checked that my symptoms and that their causes made sense and fit with what I absolutely know in my soul is the correct diagnosis at this point. I had everything ready for you to easily review. I did the work. All you needed to do was listen to me. If you had questions I had the answers there with me. 



But I know life doesn’t ever go according to plan. And I know that our medical system is broken. I have been begging for someone to help me for 19 years. That is not an exaggeration. With every passing year my life was stripped away. I have lost everything. 



First my friends because sick people are hard to hard to look at. Then my job and ability to work. I barely finished my education and only did so because I went to an understanding school that by the end let me do 80% of my work at home. After that I gave up. 



I resigned myself to the fact that being chronically ill was my lot in life and as long as I followed my doctors instructions I would survive. I have experienced some of the most unethical and frankly negligent treatment possible. 



I was given a ridiculous list of prescriptions and over medicated to the point that I am amazed that I did not die. I have been told that my experiences could not be real and that I made them up. I have been told that being in excruciating pain is something I just had to deal with. I have had to force feed myself for years on end because of chronic nausea. I have lost my ability to feel any emotion but anger. I have slept for 22 hours a day for months at a time. I have only had the energy to wash my hair every 3 weeks. I’ve had chronic constipation so bad that I bled every time I had a bowel movement. I have had to wear depends and use bed liners because I had no control over my bowels. I developed a fatty liver. I was accused of being an addict and drug seeking by some medical professionals while simultaneously having other medical professionals lecture me on how I absolutely had to take the drugs because letting the pain get out of control was dangerous. I was told that I needed to switch medications and because of doctors inexperience left to deal with dangerous withdrawal symptoms completely unsupervised.  I have lost 60 lbs in just over 2 months and complained of symptoms of starvation only to get a pat on the back because losing weight is good even if you aren’t doing it on purpose. I have learned that ideals of the modern Hippocratic oath are the complete opposite of standard treatment in our health system. 



I have had a treatment plan of shrugs and drugs and been told to just deal with escalating and debilitating symptoms because it was the standard treatment and I was a hard case to figure out. 
7 years ago I was told that 290 mg of morphine twice a day plus up to 100 mg of fast acting morphine for breakthrough pain was the limit and I needed to switch to methadone. At that point I refused the treatment and saw that I would not live much longer if I continued to follow their advice. 



I sought a pharmacists help and created a reduction schedule. I decided that I would do that reduction in 2 1/2 years instead of five because my body was deteriorating rapidly at that point and I absolutely knew it was going to give out soon. And I did that on my own despite the horrible symptoms. Despite the repeated bouts of pancreatitis. Despite feeling like I had influenza for years on end. Despite the doctors telling me that I could stop reducing at that point. That the drug was safer at that level. And when I was done the same doctors who had severely over medicated me gave themselves a pat on the back for the literal blood, sweat and tears I had put into myself. But that was only the beginning. 



I started to listen to my body and I knew that the several medications that I was still on were too much. So I continued, even when I discouraged by the doctors who honestly didn’t care about my suffering and didn’t want to help. I became an expert at titration. I took tiny doses for months. Cutting pills into tiny pieces and taking them until my body told me to stop. 



But still I was not well. I still suffered. And, after I had exhausted my doctors experience, I educated myself. And I took the steps necessary to heal the damage that had been done. 



I completely changed everything. My diet. My environment. My relationships that still existed. How I related to the outside world and the one inside me. Yet still I was deteriorating more than expected so I worked on my mental health. 



I don’t even want to get into how it is hard to actually get help in our mental health system. 



I found a therapist that was actually able to help me understand what my mental processes were doing to me physically and taught me how to help myself. I started to attempt physical activity. I have meditated almost 1000 times in the last 22 months. I have gotten to know my mind and learned to trust myself and my experiences. Yet still I deteriorated. 



I have been dumped by more doctors than you can imagine. I have been screamed at for preferring to have a pelvic exam from a female doctor while still a teenager. I have been repeatedly cut open and had an organ removed for no other reason than desperation. I have encountered sadistic behaviour from a doctor who also refused to look at my medications until before surgery, but did the surgery anyway, knowing that I would bleed profusely for days after because of his own disregard for patients well being. I been refused requests to sign documents reviewing my condition because they knew doing so would be admitting to negligence and lost my retirement savings because of it. I have been told blatantly false statements about scientific facts because they refused to admit that they were wrong. After spending 6 years going off of the medications that were killing me I was lectured on how I needed to start them again because using the resources available to them was hard and unfamiliar to them. I have spent hundreds of thousands of other people’s money on drugs, legitimate treatment that wasn’t covered and didn’t work, snake oil and voodoo. I have been experimented on and done absolutely everything that I possibly can for myself. I have fought the medical system and my darkest demons for years in order to regain some semblance of quality to my life. But I have exhausted my ability to help myself alone. I have done that work. I have attempted to make this easy for you. I have followed your instructions. But again, I am told that I am not worth the effort. 



If you, a doctor who seems to be more educated than anyone I have seen previous in exactly the types of treatments that I know are actually healing, are unwilling to help me than who, in all honesty will? 



I understand the system is against you but it almost killed me. If you do not offer any solution, and refuse to help, you are part of the problem. 



I do not want a response from you. I want you to remember me. I want you to think of me the next time you walk into an exam room and encounter a patient like me when you are exasperated with our system to the point of dumping patients. And I want you to be aware that if the system is hard for you to deal with, it is crippling to have no choice but to be a victim of it. I want you to choose to help with what you can and not worry about the can not. 




Respectfully, 


just another ‘Princess and the Pea’ patient

90,"I'm 16 and feels lonely from time to time. I'd say that I have some great friends at my boarding school and around town. I've had a girlfriend before but we broke up. I've also had some crushes on some girls but I can't find anyone to admire. 

Some people would say I'm a perfectionist and maybe that can be the reason why I can't find a crush, but I just feel like I'm either doing everything wrong when I've had a crush or I can't find anyone that I have an interest in.",15Nov2019,1

92,"I want to come to the main point. I (f) am a 27 year old student currently doing my masters degree (does not matter much).

How do i start this. I have friends in my university and at home. My studying is working out well, so in short i don't have any reason to be concerned or feel bad. And yet, i feel like something is missing or off. I get concerned over smaller or bigger things to easy, even if there shouldn't be a logical reason for me to be so much worried. I don't like to drink or go to parties (not my thing), but rather like to do something with some of my close friends. Although i would like to be more social, meet new people. I don't really have any hobbies that interest me that much. Sure there are some things (i used to like to play games, but it kinda started to wane or wear off in the last month's) or other activities (like going with friends go kart driving, although even for that i find it kinda hard to motivate myself). I mostly feel to lazy for even that. I am afraid of losing my friends as soon as they get into relationships (i already feel like i lost one) and end up being alone. I wonder if i would ever find someone who can or will love me (i know i should not whine about that as it is something only i can change myself, yet i can't get myself to even try something like tinder or so or try meeting other people through friends).

I feel so insignificant and small and there is a weight in my chest which is pulling me down constantly. I sometimes think i am a burden to the people around me (i have for example a good friend and i feel bad for making him feel bad, i just think of just leaving him as he would be better off without me. i have feelings for him and he does not, that just causes to much troubles for him but i really care for him).

I often think i would like to be someone else, someone better than me. And more and more i have the thoughts of how it would be if i would die. That the people around me are better off without me. I think sometimes about killing myself. But i would never do such a thing i don't want to imagine how much i would hurt the people i care for and i still do enjoy life.

Why am i so overthinking everything. I see people around me happy and think, why can't i be too? I am still young i don't need to worry so much but i still do. I know i shouldn't be so pessimistic or negative about the future but again i somehow am.",15Nov2019,1

94,"I am a 16 year old female- which, for starters, naturally puts me in place with others my age; who, if I were to generalise, are still confused individuals making their way into further progression.   
I feel as if people dislike me, they put emphasis on things I have done, or negative surroundings that involve me.   
I hung out with a group of girls before, I was invited by one of them- seen as I was sitting on my own,  
I hung out with them for around a week and a half or two weeks.  
One of the girls acted weirdly around me, like she really did not want me there- I could sense this, and asked her whether she really didn't want me there or not, I reiterated this many times, telling them I didn't want to 'interrupt their circle'- though, in reality, I thought it was incredibly childish and she needs to tell me what the actual problem was.   
It was then, during one lunchtime, I sat on my own, waiting for them- one of the girls walked past me, I smiled and said 'Hello', she walked past me and ignored me.   
She went straight to another girl, they were both looking at me, my heart sunk. The girl that walked past me, then came back and said 'So and so wants to speak to you', I already knew she was indirectly telling me to go away.   
So, I didn't say anything, I collected my coat, my bag, my food, and went to sit with the other girl. She started asking me about this school production, and I ended up crying. She asked me why I was crying, and I told her that I knew they didn't want me there.   
I don't like to cry, but during that moment I couldn't breath I was so upset...It confuses me because to me, it doesn't sound so bad as to make me cry. But I was incredibly upset- some of the girls came over to me and told me, 'It's not your fault, it's just So and So finds it hard to trust people because one of our friends left us for another friendship group' -- it sounded incredibly petty.  
When I was 12, my mother neglected me fully for half a year to live with her boyfriend- I was in the house, I had no heating, no hot water- I had to rely on her to bring me takeaway food.  
Waiting on her to give me food was not fully reliable- once I went 5 days without seeing her, thus I had no actual food. The only food (besides rotting meat) was a tin of cornbeef and tortillas, I ended up cutting my fingers trying to open the tin because I didn't have a tin opener.   
I was living in a mess. I had no clean clothes, no hot water to clean with, no shampoo for my hair- the doors were unlocked so anybody could have came in and hurt me. I developed insomnia because I was scared someone would come in and I couldn't get out if I slept upstairs, so I slept downstairs.   
The only problem with that was, by keeping the light on all night, that was the only thing that gave me comfort. When that turned off, I couldn't physically sleep- I started seeing things in the dark due to my lack of sleep.   
I went to sleep when it went light at 6am, then I had to wake up at around 8am. Obviously, when the summer came by I got a tiny bit more sleep- but it was limited to around 3 hours still by habit.   
I was so tired in class, I couldn't physically write, everytime I tried to write a- sometimes it would come out as a line.   
Teachers didn't question why I came in, in a FILTHY uniform, nor did they ask why I pinned my hair back everyday- nor did they ask why I looked so tired.   
I didn't have dinner money, so I didn't eat in school, I sometimes asked my friends for their leftovers, but I was never really close to anybody, so they gave it generally to one other friend they had that 'still wasn't full'  
My mother didn't want me around her, despite how much I begged her. I remember trying to get in the car with her once because I wanted to help her in the dry cleaners (she was taking all of her clothes to his house to dry clean)  she grabbed me by the forearms, digging her nails into my skin and told me to 'fuck off', I didn't want to, I was desperate to stay with her.  
She then started (as this took place in her boyfriends car that she used) banging the steering wheel out of anger, screaming, 'If you don't get out of this fucking car, I will drive into a fucking wall and kill us both!'- I refused again.  
So she jolted the car forward, grabbed me by the hair and told me to fuck off.   
I went inside and I obviously cried.  
I cried in school all the time.  
I lost all of my 'friends'  
The girl who walked past me was one of the people to witness the neglect - when we were friends before.   
I remember how she walked inside and said 'oh my god'- she saw the maggots, she saw the rotting food- she saw how I was living. She didn't tell anybody, she vowed to help me clean the place- but my other found out about it and screamed at me. The only reason I didn't clean the house myself, was due too not only how tired I was- but there were absolutely no cleaning products in the house, nor bin bags.  
When I was in primary school, nobody wanted to be my friend, I used to sleep on the bench and walk up and down the curb on my own- I had a 'best friend', but she always went off to play with her popular cousin. I tried to fit in with them, but for some reason, they disliked me.   
I find it incredibly hard to relate to people my age, I am in love with watching Operas, ballet- I love 18th and 19th century french literature- I am only specifying, because I have not met anybody YET that expresses any love for things in any pool- nor relating pool...So far!   
When it boils down to how I talk to people- I find that whether I speak to them as in my true self- they end up ignoring me.   
I had a counsellor before, who said perhaps people are a tiny bit intimidated by me sometimes, but I don't think I am the intimidating kind. Perhaps people think I lack continuity- I'm too everywhere in a frustrating way, perhaps people naturally, want a more stable person.   
Mentally, what has happened hasn't taken a huge toll on me. I didn't trust people before my mother did what she did  (You could say that is the problem, but in the sense of acquainting with people, when they act odd around you, then I don't think it's a trust matter...Maybe it is, I don't know)  I am unstable, as in contradicting the set boundaries (not in a Horrid Henry way)   
I did terribly at art, because I cannot draw bugs, nor potraits, I can only draw human heads on bugs- with literature (you do not know how much exertion it takes for me right now to attempt in writing clearly!) I am HUGELY metaphorical, I also love words...I have fluctuations where I can read a book a day from anywhere 3 weeks-3 months, but then I can go from that to not being able to read, having stick to reading a sentence over and over because I keep on drifting.  
I do think I might have ADD/ADHD  
If I were to shortly put it, everywhere, and I emphasise- everywhere, I have went, I have felt as if I don't fit in.  
I feel very out of place- people generally go off of me. I try to reintroduce myself only to get nudged back out again.",15Nov2019,1
96,"I’ve been really unhappy for a while now. Split up with my gf of one year the other day. It was for the best but I miss her and love her dearly. Every day feels like a haze, almost like nothing’s real and every day feels the same. I started to notice the patterns. It’s the same routine. I can’t look forward to my days off because I think about how I have to work the next day and I fucking hate my job. It’s a record store, a really cool place. I also manage their sister store, which is one of the only remaining video rental stores in the US. The environment is cool and my coworkers are great, but the owners don’t care about us. They treat us like corporate workers but pay us rice and beans. All I’ve got is my music, which i feel more than confident about. Maybe delusional-ly confident but it keeps me going. It’s like I can feel the success pumping through my body and I’m tired of waiting for it to happen. Other than that I kinda hate living. I live a relatively easy life, but that doesn’t seem to break my existential crisis. I want to use my time doing something valuable, not dealing with shitty customers all the time. Sorry to rant, my therapist is fully booked nowadays and I don’t really have anywhere to go.  Btw, I made some great chicken today with some fruit on the side. That was a plus aside from the crying.",15Nov2019,1

98,"Over the last decade or so (in my 30s now), I've come to realize I'm kind of a polarizing person. What I mean by that is that people like me or they don't. In the part of the USA where I live, people tend to be a lot more passive-aggressive if they don't like someone. Usually through avoidance or exclusion. It's kinda weird. 

Anyway, I know I have a weird, borderline inappropriate, dark, sarcastic, and dry sense of humor which tends to be off-putting. Often, they're self-depreciating and awkward jokes about myself. I have a hard time keeping jokes to myself. I've gotten better as I've gotten older, but still, it takes cognizant effort to keep my mouth shut.

I also have been an over-sharer. Again, I've gotten better at it as I've gotten older, but it's sometimes hard for me to try to NOT connect with people, especially at work. I just have been naturally outgoing and interested in people and interested in making friends. I don't know, just seems like my natural inclination. 

But, like I said, people tend to view me in rather polarizing ways and it's kinda gotten to the point where there are more people who **don't** like me than **do**. 

I'm not really sure anymore what to do. But lately I've been fantasizing about ghosting everyone but my immediate family and moving away to a place where no one knows who I am and try to make a real effort to live a solitary life. I don't know why I am romanticizing that, because it feels like the complete opposite of who I am. I've fantasized about being in a job where it's minimal interaction with people, and if I have to, it'd be through email. I'd keep to myself as much as possible (while still doing my job duties), go home, just do things by myself, make no effort to make friends or anything. 

I feel like I'm suffocating under the weight of my own life.",15Nov2019,1

and this type a shit keeps happening, ppl seem super into me for abt a week and then, interest wains and they let me know they wanna just be friends and its just made me real disillusioned like its rlly affecting my self confidence, why does everyone decide, nah. its been years since my last seriois relationship and even then i got cheated on.

100,"I met a man who posts a lot of things related to tech news (usually cybersecurity stuffs such as O-MG cable warning and zero day hack) on his social media accounts. He is some kinda person who does not trust Amazon, Google, Uber, Facebook and eBay and hates new IoT devices such as Google Nest products, Amazon Echo, IP cameras, etc. It's still not that hard to find those kind of people because there are lots of documents about relation between smart device and privacy made by digital experts and yet some people think that privacy is more important than convenience. 

I went to his house for installing a homemade device that he requested me to make. I looked at his computer and other electronics he had, and... I was literally shocked. His main computer runs Windows XP with Intel 775 socket CPU that has no additional security services or data encryption. His old webcam was always connected to his computer. He uses Huawei phone (with no firmware customisation) as his main cellular. His modem was also made by Huawei. 

I told him how terrible his cybersecurity is and should change that if he really cares about his cybersecurity, but he did not try to listen to me. He told me that he 'knows' about his cybersecurity and it is completely 'okay'. 

I no longer talk to him, as I know that his cyber knowledge is just piece of shit. He still reposts some tech news and warn others to be aware of their security, but I really think he should not say that.",15Nov2019,1
101," Hi Everyone! Just wanted to share a few tips that I find helpful in overcoming imposter syndrome.

And if you've never heard of imposter syndrome, it's essentially when we constantly doubt our accomplishments and we feel that at any moment people are going to call us out as a fraud, despite all the evidence of our achievements.

So, for example someone who recently got a promotion at work, may feel they don’t deserve the promotion and believe that everyone’s going to find out that they aren’t good enough for the position.

Or

A student may question if they are smart enough to pass an exam, even though they spent hours studying and normally make pretty good grades.

So, imposter syndrome is very very common. It can strike anywhere to anyone at anytime, and if you do have imposter syndrome, you are not alone!

Here's 7 tips to help overcome imposter syndrome:

I've made a video all about it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ga0JMKJOZA

Or if you prefer reading:

1. Create a Fact Folder And a fact folder is a place where you can store evidence of all of your achievements, so if you have an imposter strike you can refer back to the folder to keep your mind focused on the facts. Because it’s kinda hard to argue the facts, right? So, this could be

• Statements about the trials, the hardships, or hard work that have led to where you are today.

• Compliments that people have given you, whether it’s been in person or through messages.

• Positive reviews if you own an online business.

• Awards given or pictures of trophies.

Whatever has been an achievement or success put it straight into the folder! And next to each piece of evidence, write HOW you were able to achieve that. When we define our “how,” it helps us identify the steps we took to achieve our success and it leaves less room for our imposter syndrome to discredit our accomplishments. So, instead of just writing down “I was offered a promotion.” Write “I was offered a promotion, because I exceeded my targets over and over again, and I was doing tasks that were beyond what I initially agreed to do in my signed contract.”

2. Write Down Your Success Goals

So, when we complete a project or task that was successful, our imposter syndrome sometimes kicks in and we think “Yeah, that was ok, BUT I should have done better.” So, when we understand and define what success looks like to us BEFORE going into a project or task, then it helps to prevent our minds from thinking we should have done better.

3. Set Realistic Goals

Setting goals is completely normal. But when we set unrealistic goals, then it’s likely for us to completely avoid whatever it is we want to do, because we become overwhelmed before we even start. And if we attempt the unrealistic goal, then we’re more likely to fail…because again, it’s unrealistic. Right? And that can lead to imposter feelings. So, whenever we’ve got a massive goal we want to achieve, it’s a good idea to take that BIG HUGE goal that’s causing us intense pressure, and break it down into small, achievable steps that can be measured. For example, if you want to lose 20 lbs, don’t give yourself the goal of losing 20 lbs in two weeks. A more realistic and achievable goal would be to lose a pound a week for 20 weeks.

4. Own your Accomplishments

A lot of times we can discredit ourselves with our achievements. We say “It was no big deal” or “I got very lucky” or we completely give the credit to someone else when we had a MAJOR part in everything. So, it’s important we be aware of the language we use with others and state the facts, because it reinforces our hard work. So, for example, if someone compliments us on something that took us a lot of time to do, let’s simply say “Thank You. I put a lot of work into this” instead of “Oh it was nothing.”

5. Have an Action Plan for Mistakes

It’s easy for us to feel like a total imposter once we make a mistake. But mistakes are normal. Everyone makes them.. Every person you think is extremely successful. Yep, they’ve made TONS of mistakes. No one is immune. And when we make that one mistake, what does our brain do? Oh..it looks at all the accomplishments and achievements we’ve had and completely disregards that one mistake. NOPE. It focuses on that one mistake, despite all of our past success. BUT, when we understand mistakes are normal and part of our learning and development, then we’re able to create an action plan for when they happen instead of dwelling on that one error. So, an example of an action plan could be: Make a list that has an equal amount of positives and negatives that happened during the event and write down any improvements that you want to make.

6. Know Your Imposter Moments

When do you tend to feel like an imposter? Is there a certain time of the day when it strikes? Does it happen when you’re at work, when you’re by yourself at home or when you’re out around other people? It’s important to be aware of when you experience imposter syndrome, so that you’re able to prepare yourself. For example, if you usually have imposter syndrome in the middle of a work meeting, you can prepare your mindset before going into your next work meeting by doing one of the tips above like looking at the achievements in your fact folder.

7. Feel the Feeling and Take Action Anyway

A lot of times we feel pretty nervous or doubtful before diving into a big project or stepping into a new role. But it’s important to remember that these feelings are normal. We all have those feelings, especially when it’s something we haven’t done before. So when we have a good opportunity in front of us that’d we like to pursue and we feel like we’re not good enough or feel like we’re not ready, we should take action anyway. Because there’s a reason this opportunity has appeared in your life. It didn’t come out of the blue. There’s a reason a new role was offered to you or you’re about to take on a big project. Think about what you had to do in order to get this opportunity. When we take action even if we feel a bit nervous, that means amazing things are about to happen, because we’re going to be outside of our comfort zone, which will push us to the next level, which is where all the magic happens. And if we never try, we may always end up regretting it.",15Nov2019,1
