1,I got a 2$ raise at my job. I can’t post on my other social media cause my coworker didn’t get one. I’m so PUMPED. This is really the break I needed because I was on the struggle bus for a minute.,02Jul2019,18
2,"The best friend I have now is also my ex, so our relationship will never be *just best friends.* We're always going to be exes, and I don't mind. I just want a genuine best friend that I can talk to about *anything.* My best friend now has certain issues with a lot of subjects, like relationships, sex, my mental illness, my transition, so I never get to talk to him about things like that. I can't talk to anyone in my family besides my sister because they don't care enough and my sister is always travelling. I really want to be able to go to someone to just talk about anything. Technically I could go to my boyfriend, but I don't want to just rely on only him, I need friends.

The ""friends"" I have now, I met through my best friend. They are his friends. He gets mad when I say things like ""I wish I had friends"" and always refers to them as my friends. But, friends are people you talk to frequently and hang out with often. I don't talk to them ever, unless they come over to pick up my best friend, and that's only for like 5 minutes. We have almost nothing in common except video games, and if I'm being honest, they aren't people I would want to be friends with. I'm not saying they're bad people, they're really cool guys, but our values, morals, interests, hobbies, desires, anything really doesn't align. I don't feel comfortable around them, I always feel out of place. I'm basically that friend that could be left behind and no one would notice for a while.

If I'm being even more brutally honest, being a gay trans man, I feel like a few of my ""friends"" aren't accepting of me. We have wildly different views on a huge variety of subjects, so any kind of conversation almost always ends in some kind of debate, sometimes arguments. I can't have rational and logical conversations with them, they constantly joke around and downplay anything serious, and they judge other people so harshly. I just don't want to be around them.

I want to make genuine connections with people and be able to build a strong friendship. I want to be able to pick up my phone and call a friend when I'm feeling upset or angry or even lonely. I want to be able to hang out with like-minded people and have fun. I want to be able to turn on my PlayStation and play some games with friends. I just really want some friends, I'm lonely.",02Jul2019,4
4,"I  married my high school girl friend 20 years ago and we've had a good  sex life. We have always made it a point to make sure the other is  pleasured and happy and have tried to vary things up from time to time  so we don't get bored. Some sexy movies and such now, in our early years  it was some porn, and we learned a lot as young kids would... we  actually kind of miss the old school porn with stories (cheesy as they  were) rather than today's porn.

Anyway,  we aren't big TV people and just recently got a roku and signed up for  Hulu and Netflix. We've watched a handful of shows, and I've noticed  something. Men are constantly portrayed as sticking it in, getting off,  and moving on with life, as if she enjoyed it as much as he did, they  are both fulfilled, and life is wonderful... followed immediately by the  woman rolling her eyes because he doesn't get it.

How  accurate is that? I asked my wife what she knows about it and according  to her friends it's basically the standard. I'm not about to ask my  friends. But I'm wondering if I shouldn't!

Sorry  if this comes across as a brag, but I enjoy watching and feeling my  wife get off more than I like to get off myself, of course I like to get  off. What are your experiences?",02Jul2019,1
5,"I'm not sure if this is a rant or a cry for help. Probably both. I just don't care. I'm currently at summer break in my house (going to junior year in high school), I don't try to do anything productive, I don't want to try, I don't see the point in trying, and there is nothing there that helps push me. Friends have tried to get me up and going, but it'll work for a week or so and then I'll be back in my old routine of nothing.

I don't even care about doing sports at my school. I just don't have a lot of option. I currently 6'3 and skinny. Earlier this year, I went to all the spring ball practice for football and work out with them all spring. After ALL these months of practice. The coach told my brother, behind my back, that the only good thing I was useful was FOOTBALL MANGER. This just killed off my motivation for doing Football at my school. As a result, I haven't been going to any summer practice or weight training or ANYTHING. I just don't care about doing football anymore. I made a lot of friend doing it but what the point if the coaches are just going to bring you down.

I don't care about being with friends or making new connections- I did at the beginning and I really liked doing it, but now everyone has settled in to their places and the whole ""meeting new people to make friends"" thing has kind of died down. I don't have any success in girls. I never had a girlfriend in my life or someone who even liked me. I don't have as much fun at high school as I should. My friends don't trust me with anything calling me ""goofy"" or some other insult (Not to mention the whole school treat me like some kind of monster or stranger). They never invite me to anything, as a result, I missed out at everything.

I have lots of things I want to learn and do with my life, but I can't even bring myself to do what I'm required to do. I just feel like wasted space with no interest in bettering myself or being a productive member of society.

And even when I do get out of these holes, which happens somewhat often, it's only temporary and then I fall back in to the same habit of not caring about anyone or myself. I have no money, no one who really cares about me, girls find me weird and creepy, shitty clothes, shitty grades, (GPA is 1.4), now matter how hard I tried to gain weight. I always end up skinny, and the worst part of it? It's not even that I hate any of this. I hate feeling like this, but not even enough to do something about it. I hate my grades, but it's not like Ds look different from As when you receive your diploma. No one really cares about me (especially in the way that I feel I need. It's been months since someone told me they liked me and I blew it!!!), so why should I care about myself anymore? Clearly I'm not good enough for anyone, yet for some reason that's good enough for me.

Or is there something just wrong with me?",02Jul2019,1

7,"I have already posted about this before but I just want to let this out. I just want to rant it out here since the mods in offmychest thinks its some weird fantasy fetish thing.

About a week ago, 2 girls asked me how often I beat the chicken and when I got drunk, I confessed to them. We were close so its not that bad but they were still shocked and I'm embarrased about it.

I start thinking how crazy my act was considering that they asked years ago and my present drunk self decided I promised to tell them sooo I chatted them now, confessing my ""secret"".

I know. I'm stupid. I feel really, really bad about it. It makes me feel like a weirdo and a creep but I guess we were close sooo not that bad hopefully.

I just feel like a stupid person right now and I dont think I would be drinking any time soon.

I feel anxious all the time now since that happened and pretty paranoid and I'm never at ease with myself.

8,"How come people seem to be okay with black hip hop artists ""appropriating"" (mostly white) country culture with songs like Old Town Road and The Git Down, when I have a suspicion that there would be outrage if white Southerners were to blend elements of black culture into their art/music?  Accusations of cultural appropriation against Iggy Azaela spring to mind...

I grew up in the Middle East and went to an international school where we all shared our home dress/music/culture with each other and took the piss out of one another in ways that would make most PC Americans very uncomfortable.  Because of that, I think we understood each other on a much deeper level than most Americans understand each other today, despite the fact that most Americans have much more in common with one another than I had with my closest friends (most of whom spoke English as a second/third language).

Sorry if this is ranty, I'm just genuinely confused with how contradictory the culture is here (I live in the US now)... it's as if everyone is just going along with it because they haven't thought enough about how internally inconsistent their ""liberal"" world view is, and those that are equally as frustrated as I are either too afraid to speak out/are ostracised for doing so.  

I'm originally from Ireland and I can't help but laugh every 17 March at how none of my liberal/SJW friends realise that they are appropriating my culture when they get drunk and wear four leaf clovers around.  Their ""appropriation"" or ignorance doesn't bother me and I am pretty sure that members of the ""appropriated"" cultures here share my opinion.  Correct me if I am wrong.  Basically, I think that the whole trend was made up and is perpetuated by people who don't even really understand what they're upset about.  It's frustrating to me because it stops people from asking questions and getting to genuinely understand one another for fear of saying the wrong thing and getting branded as a racist.  And even worse... the Americans are exporting this nonsensical mindset to the rest of the world!  I have noticed Irish/British friends talking more and more like this, too!!  Put me in my place if I'm wrong/mistaken, I'm curious what you all think.",02Jul2019,4

12," 

Warning: Contents include a lot of self-deprecation and general unpleasant topics with vague language. TL;DR at the end.

I don't know why I am posting, but I hear random people on reddit are the best to tell your deepest regrets to. I was watching some askreddit videos about creepy guy, niceguys, ect. Maybe this will get me closure.

Years ago I made a friend with 'that weird girl'. As a person, I am very open and I guess make people feel like they can be themselves (my perspective). She confided in me that she was in a secret online relationship with a guy more messed up than her: suicidal, mentally unstable and the like, ect. While she told me about her issues, I ended up falling for her. I felt happy with her. I wanted more, nothing sexual, but I wanted companionship. Months of this and I was infatuated. I won't say what I did, but I was cringy m'lady type. I thought myself being romantic and similar, but retrospect I would have called myself horrible things.

Eventually she told me that she didn't want a relationship and my reaction was along the lines of, ""Oh.. ok. I didn't realize I was making your uncomfortable."" We stayed friends and I still gave her emotional support. I didn't pursue any relationship with her further. About a month of usual friendish stuff passed until I got a message from her. It was a usual trying to 1-up each other with snooty/wise responses. I can't remember exactly what she wrote but it was something along the lines of ""Vulgarity is no excuse for wit."" We had a back and forth until she wrote intelligence by accident.

I don't know why but something clicked, or rather snapped. I read back through that previous month of messages with a different view. For that entire time she had written many things with double meanings. They ranged all over, but were mostly about how my character was terrible, everyone I considered a friend was terrible, everything I liked and thought important was terrible.

I can't remember what the messages were like or even if she actually did say anything bad. After reading everything, I said either, ""F\*ck this, I'm done with you."" or ""Screw you, I'm done"". All I can remember is that I was hurt and angry.

I cut all contact. Skype, deleted. Emails, deleted (or so I thought). Texts, deleted and blocked. Phone number, deleted. I was angry at her. Not for turning me down, but for what for she may or may not have even written.

To mutual friends, I said we didn't work out. To close friends, I told them my biased view. To myself, I called her a monster. I never spoke to her again. Whenever I saw her, I looked away.

This all happened over three years ago. I never tried to contact her again.. until today. As I said I have been watching askreddit readings and just thought, ""I'm a terrible person for what I did."" So I looked through my email contacts and probably did something that will keep me awake for a while.

I wrote and sent her an email.

The only thing it was was me apologizing for my behavior. I stated this wasn't some way of reconnecting, just me wanting to apologize.

P.S. I hope I can get some closure through apologizing and telling a bunch of random anonymous strangers about it.

TL;DR: My first 'relationship' ended in a disaster. I cut contact, deeply hated her, and have realized that I am a niceguy, neckbeard.",02Jul2019,0

14,"Doing good deeds is easy to practice because it can be practiced any time anywhere, includes all types of deeds that range from small to big, one off to regular, and can be directed towards others, yourself or the environment around. As long as the deed is done with a considerate and loving heart, and leads to happiness and comfort for others, it can be considered a Good Deed. Below are three main types of *good deeds* that can be practiced easily and frequently, that purify our minds and lead to much joy for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Helping**

Helping, when done with sincerity and consideration is always welcomed by others and is generally accepted with much gratitude and happiness. To provide real help, it must create for others, convenience, while taking away their stress and worries. True helping is more about the person we are helping and less about ourselves, and so we must place ourselves in their shoes, understand the situation from their perspective and really listen to what they think, feel and want. We can appreciate the beauty of helping by thinking about difficult and stressful situations that we experience and then imagining receiving considered, effective help from a genuine and honest person. This is the type of help we want to offer others, that leaves them feeling relieved and happy. By regularly helping people and looking for ways to enrich the lives of others, not only do we become very good at it, but we will also be surrounded by people who cherish our company and enjoy our presence.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Giving**

Giving is another very practical and highly regarded *Good Deed* which creates much happiness for others as well as improves the overall positivity of the surrounding environment. The beauty of giving is that it is not limited to material things, but more often, it is the small intangible gifts that really touches the heart. For example, a genuine smile and greeting, a sincere pat on the back when someone is down, or an enthusiastic High 5 to share in someone’s joy or victory are all small forms of giving that shows someone you care. We don’t have to be rich or wealthy to practice giving. All we need is a kind and loving heart, coupled with a thoughtful, empathetic attitude. Instead of thinking big impressionable material gifts, we can consider smaller, more frequent ones that leave others feeling heard, cared about, and special. The practice of giving also promotes our cultivation of generosity and empathy which soothes our anxiety and afflictions caused by greed and selfishness.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Learning**

The last but perhaps most important good deed to practice and incorporate into our lives is the aspiration to learn and better ourselves. Only through learning and personal development are we able to equip ourselves with more ability and capacity to help others and give them exactly what they need. Because everyone is born differently, raised differently, and value and need different things, the more we learn and understand different cultures, values, and ways of thinking, the more we are able to approach and help different people. Someone who deeply appreciates the importance of giving and helping, and who takes doing good deeds seriously will unfailingly see the significance of continual learning. Learning can be fun, exciting and interesting, and as long as we maintain a humble and curious attitude, we can learn any time, anywhere, and from any situation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are some examples of simple everyday good deeds that you can do right now:**

1. Helping a friend in need
2. Volunteer at your local charity organization
3. Donate food to a homeless person
4. Take your parents out for dinner
5. Smiling and greeting your colleagues at work
6. Writing a letter of appreciation to a friend or family member
7. Donate blood
8. Do an online course to improve your knowledge about a topic of interest
9. Donate clothes you no longer need
10. Clean the house for your parents or grandparents
11. Take a walk around the park and just enjoy the nature
12. Cook a meal for someone you like
13. Donate some money to a charity organization of your choice
14. Improve your commitment to recycling
15. Do some exercise to keep you happy and healthy
16. Learn a new language

&amp;#x200B;

The power of *doing good deeds* cannot be overemphasized. Frequent practice of it will turn it into a habit by rewiring our mind to naturally think about doing things that benefit others. Consequently, it leads to happiness to everyone around which improves the quality of our lives. Not only that, but we also create positive relationships with everyone we meet which makes life that much more pleasant and meaningful.

May we move towards a culture that prioritizes doing good deeds and may we inspire each other to become kinder and happier people.

15,"I remember who I was a few years ago. I wore the same black jeans and raggedy cardigan every day. I did my makeup like a raccoon. It would have been a look if I wore it with confidence... but it was just a shallow attempt to show others how much I was suffering on the inside. 

You see, by then, I felt so lost. I was just a kid, but I wanted to die, knowing I had barely experienced life at all. There were few things I knew very well. Abuse. Abandonment. Slitting wrists. Suicide attempts. Crying. Prozac. Risky behavior.

And then I suffered the biggest heartbreak of my life. It took the form of a “boyfriend” who was actually a pervert manipulating an underage girl. He said I was broken, but I really wasn’t until he shattered my world. He did unspeakable things, and then he was gone like nothing happened. Despite all of the wrong he did, it was me who suffered the most, but this isn’t about my suffering anymore. 

In all of my anger and grief, I found courage to be better. If I wasn’t doing it for myself, I was doing it to show everyone that I could. I learned to smile just to spite them. In the next year, I put my life together. I got things together for college. I got a job, and then later, I got an even better job. I worked my ass off. I made the dean’s list.

Not only that, but I rebuilt my relationship with my family. I made the best friends. I stole the hearts of those around me. I learned to love myself so I could love others. They say I have the most beautiful smile. I healed my heart with the most tenderness, and I think it’s the bravest thing I’ve ever done. 

Despite my circumstances, I never let myself grow cold. I love with an open heart. I see good in everyone. I still believe in magic. I know there’s power in true love’s kiss. I’m still a romantic despite knowing harsh realities. That’s probably why I reinvented my style to be like a femme fatale from a film noir— because it’s romantic. And you know what? I wear it with confidence. 

It hurts sometimes. I’ve been through a lot, but I know I can always get through it. I don’t cry for hours at a time anymore. I’m getting off my medications for depression slowly. I’ve done so much work, and I’m so proud because there was a time I wasn’t sure if I’d make it this far. I did, and I’m the happiest I’ve ever been.",02Jul2019,6

He will keep living his life just like all those years ago, he will not reach out like all those years ago, he will always live on the victim side of things and he won't own up to his mistakes. And he will keep being a shitty person.

31,"A few months ago I stopped talking to a girl who I've never met before, we only talked online, on discord, snapchat, etc. but we were such good friends. We started talking on ifunny when we both were 13-ish, so we knew each other for 3 1/2-ish years. She had a lot of problems at home and a *lot* of undiagnosed mental issues. I don't want to get into the specifics but it was bad. I helped her cope with a lot of it for the majority of the time we knew each other, but she never made any progress getting better, and a lot of the time she said she was fine staying that way forever which made me so mad sometimes. We stopped talking a few times before this, for about a month each time, and always ended up ok and laughing it off. 

She only had 1 boyfriend during that time, and he made it so much worse for her by doing some things I'd rather not talk about but you can probably infer. I helped her deal with all this for months before she finally felt confident enough to tell him to fuck off. This was at the end of summer last year.

 I think we both wanted each other as more than friends, but I have my own things that I go through and I felt like it wouldn't be good for me to be in a relationship that close while having issues myself. It hurt her a lot, and  I understand why but my justification was that I needed to watch out for myself too. 

This ended up being the straw that broke the camels back. She was pretty head-on about telling me it made her feel like shit, and that she thought it was her fault. We got into an extremely heated argument, she said I was just like her ex, which pissed me off really badly. Then she got defensive and said that if it would make me want to be in a relationship she would do anything I say to help her get better (I always tried to give her advice on things to do whenever she felt manic and she usually ignored it). I told her I didn't believe her because she had never showed she would before and after a while I ended up just closing the conversation and blocked her on everything we talked on. I know it seems drastic but I felt so fed up with her in the moment that I wasn't thinking.

I miss her so fucking much. I feel terrible for what I did, but even if I apologized she wouldn't forgive me.  There's nothing I can do to get her back and I hate myself for fucking it up.",02Jul2019,2
32,"I worked all day on a job that had some major issues and as a result I may not be able to take the trip I was planning to go see my S/O. I've been in a terrible rough patch lately and not in the best place mentally so the bad news hit extra hard. I haven't smoked in years but desperately wanted a cigarette and to be alone somewhere, so I decide to go this park. 

It's huge ""park"" in my hometown that was abandoned for years and has a nice little river, it's always completely empty, and the only area that gets used is a small pavilion a mile away from the woods I was sitting by. There's no playground or anything, just nature and a few crumbling cement benches. I light a cig, and then call my s/o trying not cry and keep it together. 

Then I see this lady come out of the woods and she is making a beeline towards me, she snaps at me ""No smoking in the park!"" So I nodded, put it out and tucked remaining cig back into the pack. She proceeds to walk closer, despite me being visibly upset and on the phone. So I awkwardly/apologetically said ""I'm really sorry I didn't see a no smoking sign and figured I wasn't bothering anyone since the park is empty, I'll make sure to remember that next time."".  She then says ""Maybe there shouldn't be a next time since you can't follow the rules."". I told her again that I was really sorry, that it was my bad for being unaware of the rule change, and I won't do it again now that I know. Then she says ""That's right you won't. I'll remember you so don't think you'll get away with this ever again."". I said sorry AGAIN that I'll be going. To which she replied ""Good"", and then hovered around and watched me until I left the park, at which point I had a huge sloppy breakdown because she was the straw that broke the camels back.

I grew up near this park, I have never seen an employee there (or anyone really), I honestly am a little skeptical that she even was an employee. I looked all over the entrance for signs or posted rules and no where did it say no smoking. I was nothing but compliant and polite because I understand that smoking is offensive, and she was still horrendously rude. I want to find out who owns/operates the park if anyone, and maybe advise them to post a no smoking sign so this won't happen to others. I want to tell them I was treated poorly by an ""employee"", but I live in a very small rural village and do not want to start drama here. I know that I'm all worked up and emotional so maybe I am overreacting, but part of me thinks I'm not and a complaint might be warranted.",02Jul2019,2
33,"Over the 10ish years of leaving away from Korea, I made all sorts of friends. Aussies, Singaporeans, Americans, Mexicans and many more. Also some of my own Koreans friends. As a Korean, the Korean friends always were special since I shared something common: living away from our home country.

But I noticed that I really couldn't fit into the other Koreans.

I would be full of distaste for all of those Korean groups. They just don't seem to want to fit in to the communities they are living in. They would feel unconfortable from leaving their comfort zone to talk to non Koreans even when they all knew how to speak English fluently.

My mother also left her Korean golf community because the community started to argue with each other about something really petty that no one would actually care.

I had a group of non American friends who I hang out with as well as Korean friends on a video game. I told my friends to be nice or at least just leave them alone, but they would start picking on them even when I specifically mentioned that they were my friends.

They seem to have some sort of god complex, but in reality, they can't do shit when other people to take advantage on them. Maybe that's why they need to unleash their anger towards someone.

I had to do it. I left the Korean group and blocked all of them. I guess it was for the better good for both of them.

TL; DR: I lost my last Korean friends.",02Jul2019,1
35,"I did it reddit world, I finally got accepted into university. 
My senior year of high school I watched all of my friends receive multiple acceptance letters and being to plan their next step after graduating. 
Although I applied for many schools and was accepted to a few, I was rejected from my top choice which was the only place I had any desire to go to.
Being the stubborn person that I am, I refused to settle for one of the other universities that had accepted me and chose to opt for community college. Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong with community college but it’s something about watching everyone go to university and having to admit to family friends that I wasn’t accepted into school that really hurt my soul (yes, pride). 
At the end of my second term at community college I made a spur of the moment decision to apply to the university once more reasoning that I only had $40 (application fee) and my dignity to lose.
I did relatively well in cc and held a 3.8 GPA (much better than my hs GPA) so I was very hopeful on my acceptance to university.
A few weeks after submitting my application, I was asked to submit test results from a few standardized tests I had taken while in high school and my spirits were crushed. I took this as, “we looked at your grades and need a little bit more”. My test scores were no where near decent enough to be accepted into this university so I sent the scores in and accepted defeat. 
But as the title says, I did it. I was accepted. I get to pursue my degree starting this fall. If I wasn’t accepted this coming semester I would have been set back by a year because my cc didn’t offer the prerequisite classes I need to take during my AA.
I feel like such a weight, academic and socially has been lifted off my shoulders.",02Jul2019,2
37," Sorry for being too long and boring. Tl;dr at bottom

Gotta give some backstory for context, I had a crush on a girl in our school. Lets just name her sneha. Cut short, i proposed her, teachers knew about us, called my parents and all, i got a beating and then i promised my mom that would never talk to sneha ever. Enter secondary school, i took up PCB(physics, chemistry, biology) in hopes of cracking NEET and enter med school. I used to be a topper and all but one day i thought, ""where did sneha go?"". I haven't talked to her since that day (i went home that day, blocked her, avoided her during school and never talked). So i opened FB, unblocked her(hoping that she didn't block me) and guess what!, she didn't block me. So i've texted her again and we talked for a lot of time(we didn't bring up the school topic) and honestly, i was never this happy. I knew i was in love with her. So i've told her that and she said that she felt the same. And life was happy again for me. We texted for hours and hours without realizing time. Enter my mom again, She sees my texts again(I suck at hiding shit). She's really angry this time. This time instead of a beating, I got a 3 hour talk(Trust me, it's worse than beating) She's like "" U ain't mature enough to take life decisions"", ""she's not right for you""(How do u even know? u didn't even meet her). And she goes on and on for 3 hours, And me, being an immature dude at that time was like, ""Alright mom, I'm sorry for everything, I'm not gonna talk to sneha again"". Well, she believed me(At least that's what i presume) But I couldn't stop talking to her, this time i used internet cafes for my talking and didn't even have any social media on my phone. And like that, School's done.

Enter med school, Life was great. My mom didn't knew i was talking to sneha(i changed her name in contacts and we texted through whatsapp). we used to occasionally meet in secret in some restaurant. The thing with me is that I never had any good friends with whom i could share my life's stuff and all but I never really cared for that. So for the 1st time, i get a best Friend in Med school. Lets just call her Megha. We instantly became best buds(Thanks to both of us being equally weird and our common love for DC comics). So it's Megha's Birthday in a week. I wanted to do something special for her 19th Bday since It was her 1st bday since we met and she's like the only best friend I care about. So i tell my mom about megha and how she's like my best friend. I thought my mom would make a rant about me having a girl best friend but for my shock she didn't. She was all chill(At least she appeared like that). So i said that her Bday's in a week and I'm thinking of throwing a party to her with some of her schoolmates. She agreed to it and the whole week, i was soo busy in preparing the perfect party for her and the party turned out really great. Sneha was there too and we all enjoyed a lot and everything was going great.

Cut short to present, It's been a month since the party's done and I got my exams in 2 weeks and I'm really studying hard for them. So my mom comes near me and asks for my mobile cause she needs to watch some cooking videos and the laptop's battery drained. So me, in my exam stress didn't care too much and unlocked and gave my phone to my mom. I thought that since sneha's name is under a different name, she wouldn't care. Oh boi I fucked up again. Sneha shared a meme on IG. FUCK. We can't change names on IG. My mom saw it again (This has become repetitive Ain't it""). This time, I understood how much of a hypocrite my mom is. Don't get me wrong, i love my mom but..idk. So anyways, she calls me inside her room, asks me whether I'm talking to sneha or not. This time, since I've become old enough and all...I decided to man up. I've said yes confidently. She was shocked at my bold reaction (i always used to afraid and couldn't speak shit). But my mom's always fucking ready. She this time Curses on me, like literally she used all the worse words u could've ever imagined. And there goes my courage. I've never expected that from my mom. She used sentences like "" u betrayed me"", ""ur a fuckin disgrace to our family"". I don't wanna go more into the context but it's pretty rough. Now comes the part that really fuckin made me call my mom a hypocrite. She asks me why I was too friendly with Megha and asks if I'm being flamboyant and all just to make Megha fall in love with me. She brings up about the birthday party telling that what's the need to be soo close with her and why did ME out of all, arranged a whole party planning for over a week. She continues by asking whether I'm tryna be a playboy or some sort by being close to 2 girls. I was fuckin dumbfounded. I got no words. I thought my mom was chill with the birthday party thing. I never knew my mom has a double face where she hates what I'm doing but pretends she's chill with it. I finally get a best friend out of all these years and this is how u respect her? Why can't she get her head straight that a girl can be a guy's best friend and nothing more than that. And what's with her interfering with my love life? Can't she like trust me that I've made a good decision. I mean, i wasn't asking my mom that imma marry sneha right fucking now. She hasn't even met sneha and how can she just jump to conclusions that sneha's isn't for me. What the actual fuck is wrong with her. With all these questions running in my mind, and my mom screaming in front of me demanding an answer, i couldn't speak. I left the room without uttering a word, crying and just fell flat on my bed locking the door. My mom banged it for 2 minutes but eventually didn't care. And here I am, writing this post. I know what ya'll are thinking right now ""this dude's just 18 or something but thinking way out of his league and i'm over exaggerating"" and probably bout to comment ""man up kid. enough seeking attention. just go speak to ur mom"" and some others are gonna be like ""study 1st asshole, u can think bout all this shit later"". Yaa, imma bout to do both. I'm gonna man up and try speak to my mom after I'm done with my exams and I'm gonna study hard. But i don't think I'm gonna be the same with my mom after this. Like, let's be honest, she was double faced with megha's situation. She acted like she had no problem with me throwing a party to my only best friend and when time comes, she lashes out on me bout that? I don't think i can share stuff with my mom after this. If there's any parent reading this, learn to trust your kids and respect their decisions. We ain't stupid assholes. I know we can get wrong sometimes but please hear us out. Don't just brush off what we say. Come to our side and hear our version too. That's all i got to say. 

Tl;dr - My life sucks.",02Jul2019,1
39,"
Guys, I really need your advice. 
Here’s some context: 
(Btw my English is suck but I’m doing my best, thanks for your understanding. And this is my through away account because I don’t want this affect my life) 
-I’m an teenager, just got my drive license yesterday. 
-Moved from an Asian country a few years ago. 
-Most important: I’m a thing you call, weaboo. I like to watch anime and play Japanese video games. 
Okay, let’s get back to the main thing, this is my story. You’re feel free to judge, I don’t mind. 
Back then when I was in the third grade, I saw an accident on the tv about a group of elementary kid went missing, three days later they found them in the trunk of a really big type of truck. Yes, they were kidnap and the gang(?) were getting ready to send them to China. So I sat there in front of the tv, watched the whole thing. Then my brain start to imagine things like, if I was one of the kid that got kidnap, I would do this and that to escape, I build a scene in my head and felt pretty confident about it. “The scene” took a few minutes and I got bored, so I stopped there and back with the housework. 
I was in the fifth grade, I watched my first episode of anime, it was Sailor Moon. I did enjoy the movie, when I close the laptop, go to my bed and every episode that I have watch just watch pop up in my head and it just...you know, when you was a kid, you would imagine yourself as a person/hero that you like and role-playing that character, I did the same thing too. I replace the main character, which was Sailor Moon, by myself and what I would do if I have super power like her, transformation, fight with the bad guy and fall in love with the male character.
Then I was in my seventh grade, now, after of four years of “role-playing” in my head, I get to the point that if I saw something cool/sad/excited, I would play that in my head immediately and the imagination in my head is really clear and...I don’t know how to say it but it’s just like everything in my imagination is in front of my eyes, it’s so real and make me thing that actually happen to me. But I didn’t think much about it, it is what it is, I just leave “role-playing” going on. 
Now I a junior in high school, still doing the “role-playing” thing. Just letting you do I won’t confuse you, i don’t really have a great family and a happy life, but I okay with it, and I love how is everything going on inside my head, the imagination, I can do anything in there just by thinking - that I couldn’t do it in reality, so I enjoy the way the world is turning around me in my imaginary. I feel powerful, confident, brave and no fear. It’s like treatment for all of the stress coming from my daily life. But the fun always end, about four and five months ago, I noticing that the time I sit down without any reason and imagine things (like what if I was born in a rich family, I would do this for living and do that to spend the money), the scene just keep going on and on, I have to force myself to get out of it - the scene inside my OWN head. 
So far I always have to ability to control it, like I can use my brain, my imagination to imagine “the scene” whenever I wanted to and stop/get out of it whenever I want to do so, but few month ago until now, I think I’m losing it, I’m keeping imagine things and it is really hard to get back and stay focus on the activities I’m really life. Like I said from the beginning, I just got my license, so yesterday when I was driving, I got blank out and the “role-playing” was in my head, it was about a movie called Les Miserable, how am I taking the role of Jean Valjean and save the boys. I don’t know how long was it, but I almost hit the car in front of me. Then I was panic. 
I’m panicking, what do I do now? Now I cannot stop it or control it anymore, in a blink of an eye I’m already start imagining thing without noticing it. Back then the whole just going in my head but now I start to talking about out loud my lines from the imagination “scene”, I cannot stop it.
What do I do now, please give my some advise, I’m scare one day the same thing will happen again and there’ll be an accident or one day I may confuse the reality vs my imaginary. (I already have some false memories from the imagination and thought it was a real-life-thing that actually-did-happen, but not much, I still can be able to identify it if true or not by trying hard to questioning myself) 
I cannot ask my parents to take my to the doctor, this is not what I can share with my family, absolutely not. 
And the problem is, I enjoy how thing is so beautiful in my head, there is some part of my don’t want to give up on it. It’s my only way to entertain myself, make me feel better and more confident, It is like you can walk into another dimension and life a different life without thinking and the other thing doesn’t matter to you, just be what you are. I love doing it so bad. But yes, I’m afraid. Am I paranoid or am I crazy? 
Please help.",02Jul2019,3
41,"Yesterday, a redditor DMed me because he saw my username in a post and we started talking about teaching. We moved the conversation to kik and it became kinda sexual but I was into it. I’m in Chicagoland and he’s in Alabama so I knew it wouldn’t go anywhere, but I was into some sexy texting. We both said that we were single and he said my kik profile picture was cute. He sent me unsolicited nudes with a wedding ring in the frame.. 🙄 and then I looked further into his reddit profile and saw that he had posted about having a pregnant wife. 

After looking even further into his reddit activity, I found out he’s into some weird shit (in my opinion) and now I’m just feeling really grossed out.

44,"I'm intimidating. I'm not that tall - where I'm at currently, I'm actually noticeably shorter than the average man my age. I'm not that muscular either, although I used to train frequently. But I do project some presence. And my face helps amplify it. I have what they call here a resting bitch face. My neutral expression is very stern, and it helps amplify my height and bulk.

This makes me look more intimidating. This makes me less approachable. My female friends have told me so. It makes sense. I'd never befriended any of them by myself - it was always while I was with another friend. It doesn't help that I don't speak much either.

Now I'm away from my friends. I decided I should socialize more - after all, no man is an island. I started talking to my coworkers.

I clocked out late one day, and missed my bus. I decided to footslog it. AC/DC's Shoot to Kill makes for a very good track for walking, and made the stroll back home feel like I was doing a mile a minute.

Then I saw Oscar and Rachel in the distance, headed the same way I was. Sure Rachel's walking towards where she lives, but Oscar's going the complete opposite way - he lives right next to work, not eight blocks away from it. They were going slower and I was catching up. I decided to join up. They noticed me, and their reactions were expected.

""Omigod you scared me! Where the hell did you even come from? You were the last to clock out.""

""Yeah dude what the hell. You clocked out mad late. You must walk really fast.""

They told me they were getting food at the local burger joint which I also happened to frequent. I told them I was getting dinner there too. We got there and actually had a good hour-long chat before we parted ways, and I had them dying from laughter for a good part of it.

The next day, I was at work again with Rachel. Molly was there too. I don't know much about her. She's quiet, and people are also quiet about her. I overheard Rachel talking about me to Molly. I was across the hall and on the other side of the partition, they thought I couldn't hear them. I've heard of what people say when they think other people can't hear them. This was different.

""...He's actually really funny. He doesn't look like that type but he's got some jokes...""

Later the boss sends Rachel to cover somebody, and puts me in her place with Molly.

""OP, where are you from?""

I tell her.

""Oh really? I have a friend who's from there too!""

I tell her the name of her friend, including her ethnic title. I'd seen her before. There aren't much of us around here.

""Yeah! That's her! Do you know her?""

I tell her I don't. I do know her. I know where she's from, where she lived, and what she does. I know who she's dating, where she moved to, and when she's coming back. People talk about her, and I pick up things easily. But I've learned ""knowing"" only counts if all that information was given to you directly.

""Yeah that's funny, you don't sound foreign. I thought you were from the States""

I assured her I wasn't. And the shift ended without incident.

In subsequent shifts, Molly spoke to me more and more. When we're not talking, I notice our eyes connect often. But I thought I was intimidating. I thought I was unapproachable.

One day, Tom from work invited everyone to his house party. He was moving to a different state. It was a bring-your-own-booze kinda gig.

""Are you gonna go, OP? Molly asked.""

Tom's a friend of mine. I told her I will be going. I ask her if she was.

""Yeah definitely.""

On the day of the party, someone from work offered to drive to the liquor store. I went, Molly went. It's on the way to my house. We got there, Molly got out, and pointed down the road I take to get home.

""I live down that road""

I told her I do too. She asked where, but I couldn't tell. I just moved, I don't remember the address - too busy remembering trivial things about random people.

I told her I'll see her at the party, she said the same. Then we parted ways.

At the party, I got absolutely hammered. I remember seeing a lot of people. I remember hearing a lot of useless things. CJ just started going to college, doing the same major I did. Jenna works at the skate shop. Brian didn't like me. David thinks I'm his long lost brother. James  thinks it's creepy that I know his name and his year in college because he's never seen me in his life. But no Molly.

A few days later, I'm back at work. Molly's there too.

""OP, I heard you got hammered at the party""

""Oh yeah? Who snitched? Cus I know you weren't there""

""Lol I'm not telling."" She said she had her reasons. Then we got back to work, till we clocked out.

""Hey OP, do you take the bus or do you walk back home from work?"" She closes her station.

""Either-or. Depends on the day."" I clock out.

""Are you walking back today?"" She clocks out.

Told her I was. I figured that's what she wanted to hear. I go and grab my stuff from the staff room. Molly wasn't behind me. Guess I read that wrong. I come back out, I see Molly again, heading for the front exit. I follow her through it.

We had a nice talk on the way back, and her route was very similar to mine.

""Well OP, my house is down the road on the right. Are you going straight?""

Mine was on the right too, but a good number of blocks ahead. I recognize the road she's pointing down. It's just a different way to get to my place. I've missed too many opportunities in life by saying no, but here, it felt appropriate.

""Nah, you lead the way. I've only been down that road at night. I wanna see how it is in the day.""

A few houses go by.

""Well, this is my stop."" #2768, I see out the corner of my eye.

I say my goodbyes and move on.

And I thought I was unapproachable. And I thought I was unapproachable.",02Jul2019,6

51,"Every-time I see a post with somebody talking about depression or social anxiety, but then they abruptly mention they have friends and it just blows me away. I can't help but think, how? How are you able to have friends even with many of the same mental turmoils I too suffer from? How do people still like you enough to be your friend, and care about you, with all the self-doubt inside of you?

Why is that I have social anxiety and depression, but I haven't had a real friend since kindergarten and now I'm 25? Why is it that I have never held a girls hand or kissed anybody? I've tried being outgoing before. I've gone to therapy, taking medication. It hasn't helped. If anything, it's hurt me. 

The more willing I am to express myself, the less people seem to like me. I've gone through a constant internal battle over over this for the last couple years. Is my depression just trying to convince me I'm inherently unlikeable or is that the objective reality of my life?  


I guess I've come to the conclusion, after a lifetime of experience living in my own mind, that I'm simply inherently likable and that I can't keep making up my excuses for myself. It's not my depression or social anxiety clouding my ""real personality"" that everybody would love if they can see it. I've taken medication, and shown people my 'real personality' and they did not like it.

More recently I left my copywriting position at a big corporate fashion company to peruse something different, but I just wasn’t sure what so I took a position at different company as the customer service manager. I really like the style of clothes they produce, but their customer reviews were beyond shitty so I seen this position as more of a challenge  that only someone with a lot of experience like myself could handle.

This is a fairly small company so aside from the customer support reps I manage, my other coworkers  are younger girls about ages 21-23. From the start of me being there I could tell that the younger girls thought they were super cool because they worked for this company and really took themselves a lot more serious than they should, but I’ve been there before in my younger years so I didn’t really care. I could also tell that they didn’t take me that serious being that I was only doing customer service and they didn’t know all of my previous experience, but again, I didn’t really care. I was just there to do my job (it certainly wasn’t an easy one at this company).

Fast forward to now, I get along pretty well with everyone and like all of the girls, but I am starting to realize one girl that I am pretty close with is really starting to affect my mood. I have zero issues with her personally, as she is nice to me, but she’s always super moody or going through things and I feel like her energy can be so draining at times. Even if she isn’t talking, it’s like a dark cloud just enters the room. Not to mention we sit upstairs and she literally like to work in almost total darkness as if she’s the only person in the room.  Also, today we were having a conversation and she was trying to explain to me that “creatives” need to be able to work in certain types of environments to thrive, as if I wasn’t a creative and didn’t already know that myself. I have to admit I got a little butt hurt. That made me realize that I’m starting to get really tired of being looked at as the “customer service girl” when I know I have SO much more experience and could do the girls’ jobs way better than they can. 

Am I being overly sensitive? I really like my bosses and my job is pretty laidback, but I’m starting to be over it. I’m starting to feel like I need to get back out there and start utilizing my talents.",02Jul2019,1

65,"This has been on my mind for the last day or so. From a larger perspective, I find it crazy how, out of the billions and billions and billions of experiences that have been had here on earth, I’m lucky enough to be born in the same century and time as something as uniquely creative as Taking Back Sunday. Or television. Or even vegan cheeseburgers. And I’m not even vegan. Does this ever cross any of your minds? So many human beings have been alive on this beautiful orb flying through nothingness, and we’ve all been here to collectively experience things as beautiful as space travel and the internet. I mean think about that!! Any information you could want at the tip of your fingers within seconds. Go back 200 years ago and people don’t even know that they’re missing out on something as grand as that. As society improves, and we all collectively become more compassionate and caring for each other, I think we’ll all begin to notice that the uniqueness of the human experience is the most luxurious thing of all. Because for all the things we collectively enjoy together, there are also experiences that have to be had alone. Like overcoming our struggles. Falling in love. And then falling in love again. Facing our fears. The beautiful thing about being human is that none of our journeys are the same and yet they are all irrevocably interconnected and linked. We all are truly our brothers keeper. If we don’t take care of each other nothing will ever work. For all it’s horrors and broken dreams there’s still a side of the world that is beautiful and awe inspiring. The unique things we all are here to experience for this infinitesimally small time we have on earth are something to be celebrated.

This is the story, i have this ldr relationship, every month I travel just to see her, feed her with foods, talking our future, just that I can see myself when im with her then, suddenly this girl 2 came to my life (just 2 days bruh)... dude she's not that kind of pretty but the way she look at me like she never looked at anyone else before ( I caught her eyes lookin at me then she simply change her eyes direction after). After that he borrowed my headset just to listen music right inside her phone. Dude I'm really messed up and I dont know what to do at this moment.

Fast forward... we met actually at our outing. All my office mates have a partner except this girl 2 (one of my office mate friend). So yap, we talked, we swam at the sea, took pictures, listen to music. I took a stolen pic of her and I jut realized that she's so pretty and Im starting to ask myself why is this happening to me? Is this a struggle? 😐 because being with her I feel comfortable and completely fine. In short... she's helping me to restore my heartache and throw all those stress away.

My question is, why this kind of type of a person came to my life? Coz this girl 2 was the one that I'm looking for a long time. How about my present gf? If I leave her she will surely cry and I dont want to see her crying. Guys any advice? Thank you in advance.",02Jul2019,0
68,"So I just need some input. Might even x-post to r/amItheasshole? But above all else I think I need to put my thoughts to the breeze in hopes my mind will let me sleep afterwards.

The both of us for the past 3 weeks have confessed to each other that we're growing more fond of each other. Which is a relief for me because of how long I have been single. I'm very intimate person, most my woes can be cured with a soft and opened hand.. I'm simple that way

So one of my oldest friends asked me for my opinion on her going through transition (of an atypical variety but that's not my news to share) and dispite very carefully selected words she wasn't terribly pleased with my response, though her immediate reaction wouldn't have lead me to believe she either torn apart or relieved. Days later she tells me about how upset she had become over my thoughts on the matter and started subtly treating worse for it.
She knows a lot of people who are transgender (and for the record I have 0 issue with for that fact) but based on the people she has been spending her time around, I was worried she wanted to go under the knife for the wrong reasons and that's what I told her, with no correlation with her plans for manners sake. But over this incomplete chat and only getting about half my thoughts in, she was saying that she almost blocked me on social media and from there cut me from her life entirely.
This one conversation is the only negative interaction between us for somewhere around 7 years. And dispite the advice of my 2 closest friends, I've been nothing but nice to her. Part of me is worried that she is just searching for reason to be angry with me, drive me away. But she does have a bit of a history, with me personally, of lashing out at others that have nothing to do with the reason she is upset.

She wants to discuss this over again, I agreed because I don't think she fully understood what I had ment. And I've just been stewing in my own anger trying to figure how else to tell her how much she worries me with this..

And now I just feel like trash, I'm tired of trying so hard to be kind to someone who only seems to try and find reason to be upset
I'm tired of not smoking
I'm tired of not sleeping (ironic, I know)

I told her I was suicidal, and she started yelling at me out of shock of being woken up to something like that. I just didn't know who to turn to. And the second she stopped yelling, some asshole in the yard started clapping. What the fuck? I wish that when you have a mental health crisis, that someone finds it entertaining. Asshole.

Nonetheless, i sort of imagined my first kiss to be with a cute guy that I liked, on a nice spring day, or something stupid, but well... we were at a festival partying, I got pretty drunk and made out with some guy... I could feel his stubble, he was probably a bit older than me... I was very weird, not necessarily pleasurable, but I don't regret it. In fact, I made out with two guys... 

I just feel like everyone seems to have this cute, or at least, although awkward, somewhat nice first kiss. And if it went something like mine, they regret it. But I don't. I don't really know why... should I regret it? I have done a lot of things lately that i maybe shouldn't do, and I know my parents wouldn't be too happy about, but for some reason I feel good about it.

A month ago I was laying in bed and I noticed a bump on the underside of my left testicle. Immediately I was super scared and worried, but in the morning when I took my shower I was searching for the bump but couldn't find it. I figured it was just my imagination until last night I felt it again.

For some reason it's easier to find when laying down and when i'm aroused, I'm thinking it could be my Epididymis since it seems to be in that spot, but I can only find it on my left ball not my right one... The bump is about the size of a piece of rice, maybe smaller and no pain occurs from it, but when I touch it I do feel a weird sensation in my left testicle almost like when you get kicked in the nuts, not the pain part but that weird tingle part. Even now that I am sitting in my room I am having trouble finding it again, I eventually did find it but it doesn't feel as large as last night when I was aroused.

83,"I feel like all my life has been a game of dominoes. I painstakingly line them up, hoping this time they’ll stay up. Then something happens that creates vibrations, one of the pieces falls and then, they all go toppling over. And I take a moment to witness the destruction. To take my breath. And then, I put them back in place. Much like Sisyphus, it’s an endlessly repetitive cycle. And I’m exhausted. Thirty-five years of putting so much effort in every aspect of my life. Building a friendship, where I poured my soul. Doing a PhD, where I gave everything I had. Pining after the same man for 10 years, hoping he’ll see me. The man saw me, told me he loved me, then decided to go back to his former lover. Or at least that I wasn’t worth hurting her over. I don't know why i though this time would be any different. He couldn't leave her for me. And now, even though he's not with her anymore, she's still his priority. I was an idiot to things could be any different. My best friend, who in many ways was like a partner to me, who’s children I love as my own, decided that she was pulling away at the very moment this man came into my life, when i needed her most. Again. Probably because she was afraid that he would take her place, and she pre-emptively locked me out. I always kept a place for her. I didn't realize she could discard me so easily. My job, that I thought I would love, is with my same advisor who thinks I’m weak and unambitious.  I want to love what i do, but i feel like she's just waiting for me to fuck it up.

I've got a family to take care of and my severance is running out in a few weeks (first time I've ever gotten a severance from anyone ever, so I feel very lucky to at least have gotten that).

I've really tried hard to find a job in my field.  I've been to a ridiculous amount of interviews.  And I've spoken to a ton of recruiters (who all ghosted me, by the way).  I'm starting to feel a little cursed, like there's something seriously wrong with me.  I went from feeling really confident/comfortable in my skills to wondering what I'm meant to do with my life.  

During an interview yesterday, the guy said that he was concerned that I couldn't 'keep up' with the pace of the work in the office.  That's all well and good - I don't want to be somewhere that has me working myself to death.  But, it honestly hurt my pride a little bit.  I just turned 36 (I could maybe pass for late 20's) and I have tons of energy, but that guy made me feel like I'm a 100-year-old athlete trying to join the olympics.  My confidence is slipping, I'm slowly getting fatter and sadder, and I'm terrified that I won't be able to keep my home and put food on the table.

My dream has always been to pour my whole heart into one of my hobbies and hopefully find success.  I'm definitely a dreamer, but I've kind of proven to myself that I don't have the ability to stick with something and see a project through on my own.  I usually need someone dictating deadlines/goals to me in order to complete a project.  I do very well in a structured work environment. This is probably the reason I'm still stuck in the rat race.

I'm coming to the realization that I'm just not the kind of person that can live the dream.  I always think that there will be that life-changing event that will make me more motivated or get me inspired.  But, it never happens.  It kind of kills my spirit a little bit.  I don't want to jump from corporate layoff to corporate layoff for the rest of my life.  I want to find something more.  But, I don't think I'm the kind of person who can do that.

92,"I'm not sure if this is a rant or a cry for help. Probably both. I just don't care.

Friends have tried to get me up and going, but it'll work for a week or so and then I'll be back in my old routine of nothing.

I don't even care about doing sports at my school. I just don't have a lot of option. I currently 6'3 and skinny. Earlier this year, I went to all the spring ball practice for football and work out with them all spring. After ALL these months of practice. The coach told my brother, behind my back, that the only good thing I was useful was FOOTBALL MANGER. This just killed off my motivation for doing Football at my school. As a result, I haven't been going to any summer practice or weight training or ANYTHING. I just don't care about doing football anymore. I made a lot of friend doing it but what the point if the coaches are just going to bring you down.

I don't care about being with friends or making new connections- I did at the beginning and I really liked doing it, but now everyone has settled in to their places and the whole ""meeting new people to make friends"" thing has kind of died down. I don't have any success in girls. I never had a girlfriend in my life or someone who even liked me. I don't have as much fun at high school as I should. My friends don't trust me with anything calling me ""goofy"" or some other insult (Not to mention the whole school treat me like some kind of monster or stranger). They never invite me to anything, as a result, I missed out at everything.

I have lots of things I want to learn and do with my life, but I can't even bring myself to do what I'm required to do. I just feel like wasted space with no interest in bettering myself or being a productive member of society.

And even when I do get out of these holes, which happens somewhat often, it's only temporary and then I fall back in to the same habit of not caring about anyone or myself. I have no money, no one who really cares about me, girls find me weird and creepy, shitty clothes, shitty grades, (GPA is 1.4), now matter how hard I tried to gain weight.

103,"It was my freshman year of high school. Because I lived in a small town between two cities, most of my friends from middle school ended up going to a different high school. So on my first day at a new (large, ~4000 students) school I was looking for somewhere to eat, and ran into my cousin. She is a year older than me, and invited me to eat with her group of friends. There was one girl I noticed almost instantly. She was beautiful, smart, funny. We got along well and quickly became friends. We would get together on weekends to watch movies, we shared music, burning each other CDs. Her mom loved my appetite, it became something of a joke that within 5 minutes of being at their house I'd have a full meal laid out in front of me. If she was coming over to my house to watch a movie, she almost always showed up with food. Not leftovers, something her mom had specifically prepared so she could bring it for me.

She introduced me to a lot of movies. She introduced me to genres I never realized I'd be interested in. Psychological thrillers and generally weird movies. One night she suggested we watch Eraserhead, and after that we had to keep watching other David Lynch movies. One day after school she invited me to come over, cooked me chicken and pan fried baby artichokes, then homemade blueberry scones for dessert while we watched Pan's Labyrinth and then You've Got Mail. One night I brought over a bottle of scotch (the balvenie doublewood) and we laid in her bed watching The Room.

She was my first real crush. When I was a Sophomore and she was a Junior I managed to very awkwardly ask her to the upcoming winter ball. She apparently didn't realize what I was asking (I wish I could remember what exactly I said...) but the following day told me that of course she would go with me. This was my first date, she was the first girl I asked out. We went on a sort of double date with her childhood best friend and this other guy. 

After high school she went to a nearby school and I'd drive out there to continue watching movies with her. She invited me to a small swing dancing club they held at night. She would invite me to parties - at her college apartment, or family gatherings at her parents house. One night, I brought over a bottle of (what I now recognize to be) some very mediocre mead. Anybody in the US should be able to find it for about $12, it's called Chaucer's. We were up late (as usual) watching Big Trouble in Little China drinking and talking over the movie when I began to wonder how difficult it would be to make mead. Turns out, it's not so difficult and in the last 8-ish years mead making has become a huge part of my life.

Eventually, I started dating another girl. Funny enough, they went to the same school. I, of course, continued to hang out with this girl who was one of my closest friends, but we didn't hang out as often. Maybe a few times a year we'd get together to watch some movies and talk until the early hours. When my girlfriend and I were having trouble, this is who I knew I could talk to about anything.

After about 5 or 6 years, my girlfriend and I broke up. We'd already planned a trip halfway across the country - for a wedding of some cousin of hers. I don't know if anybody has gone on a week long trip across the country with someone you'd just broken up with, but... it was not a lot of fun. I think on a Wednesday I texted my friend ""Hey, I'm currently in Chicago, but I'll be back next week, are you free to hang out?"" After graduating I'd gotten a job in the city where she'd moved away to college. She had never left, and was still doing some research at the school. She'd been accepted into a masters program on the other side of the state, 400 miles away. It was summer, but she was going to be leaving soon. I hadn't seen her in maybe 6 months, but sometimes that's just how it goes. Anyway we were what, 24, 25? We'd always have time to hang out and watch weird movies. We made tentative plans to grab dinner.

I got back from Chicago late on a Saturday. I sent a text asking what day works for dinner. I didn't hear back immediately, but that really wasn't unusual. Sunday, I moped around at home. I'd just had my first big breakup, and that trip took a lot out of me. Monday was a holiday. Monday evening I had a phone call. Some mutual friend I hadn't really spoken to in a while. This is the girl who we went on a double date with to the winter ball years before. I couldn't understand what she was saying. She was sobbing, trying to tell me something important. ""She's dead"" and ""She died in her sleep"" ""we still don't know what happened"".

A few days later I went to her parents house. Her father was in the front yard, I collapsed into his arms, crying. He took me inside and I sat on their couch sobbing for an hour. It was a brain aneurysm, the doctors said. It was completely unexpected. Everyone tried to understand what had happened, but how can you? The day before, they'd had a small family party. She'd gone to bed maybe a little early. Had she been complaining about a headache?

Her parents asked me to go into her room and take something to remember her by. She had been an english major. I found two books - The Picture of Dorian Gray, and Catch 22. She had at some point read them for a class, I assume, because they were full of highlighted passages. In 3 different colors. With post it notes, to mark pages. From the fireplace mantle in their living room, they took down the corsage I'd given her for winter ball almost 10 years previously. Apparently she had said it was too beautiful to throw away. They asked me to be one of the pallbearers at her funeral. 

That was 5 years ago. I still think about her almost every day. I wish I could share music with her, watch movies with her, ask her what she thinks about new movies coming out. I never really had a chance to share my mead with her, a project she had prompted. Would she have gone to see the new Lara Croft movie? What would she think of the person I've become?

I don't know what point I was trying to get at when I started writing this. I've been wanting to watch some old film noir movies lately, and she's the person I would have watched them with. I miss her.",02Jul2019,3
104,"Posting this from my main cuz I just don’t give a fuck anymore. I have BPD (and probably depression idk) and within the last 6 months I have sunken to an awful place with my mental health. Every couple months I’ll have an episode for a day or two. The negativity in my mind reaches critical mass and gets too overwhelming for me to handle. I usually keep to myself when this happens because I don’t have a large support circle, but when I start to think about ending my life I reach out to folks in that circle. Last week was one of those episodes and I guess my mom has had enough because when I reached out to her, feeling absolutely hopeless, she got upset, essentially said “don’t not kill yourself” and hung up the phone. She then proceeded to text me, doubling down on her statement and being reductionist, claiming the pain I have been feeling isn’t legitimate. That evening I walked down to the train tracks by my house twice. Both times I put my head on the track and closed my eyes, waiting for the train, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it.",02Jul2019,13
106,"So if you cut out all the factors, the ones that are tangible, exercise, social life, good health and diet...what's left?

What's blowing my mind is that I'm doing a lot in my power to leave anxiety up to me.  I get 45 hours of moderate/heavy exercise a week (my job), I know a metric fuckton about nutrition and I almost exclusively eat whole, real foods.  I put myself in so much real stress that you would think other simple things wouldn't stress me out, but they do.  And it's not that the mentality stresses me out (well maybe that's what triggers the physical), I can feel the physical stress.  I can feel my body going from feeling like pure nothingness and calm to my jaw tensing, my neck tensing, the parts kf my body where I'm weakest controlling me.  It changes my mindset just purely because I'm tense.  It's like you go back into old thinking patterns.  Like your bodily tension is linked to how you think.

I compartmentalize very well.  Each day is seperate and I don't worry about the next until it happens.

Yet, every time something out or the ordinary happens that puts me in a new spot, my brain finds a way to tell my body to lock up a little bit.  There have been times where I see it coming, I start to feel the jaw tension, and the only way i've ever gotten out of it is believing a different reality (really, the true reality that nothing is wrong).  Or just fighting to stay in the reality I was just in.

On the weekends, with no future stress, work week is over, I say to myself this is your time to relax, it's like I'm living this dream or fantasy that let's me relax more than i've ever in my life.  I can go back into the past, feel those same amazing feelings I did as a kid.  Really reflect and live in the current reality too.  My best moments are when I'm so firmly in reality that everything is possible all at once.  But at some point the work week rolls around and it's like my mind goes back into work mode only because I believe it.

It's blowing my mind how much my own personal anxiety is just a projection of mental and physical belief.",02Jul2019,1

108,"Where to start with this one, reddit... it's been about 5 months (Feb 2019) since I \[28M\] broke up with my girlfriend \[39F\] of about seven and half years. She was my 2nd girlfriend ever, and also the 2nd girl I have ever kissed - don't feel bad for me, kissing girls I'm not in a relationship with just isn't my thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I mainly need to vent the whole story somewhere in writing, my friends have been pretty good to me in terms of supporting me and pulling me out of the emotional gutters that you fall into after this kind of thing. So here goes the story:

&amp;#x200B;

We met when I was 21, I asked her out on a few dates and eventually worked up the courage to kiss her on the 5th date, not long after that things were 'official'.

We ended up living together at my mum's house after about 6 months of being together - out of necessity more than anything, her parents sold up and moved overseas and getting a rental was very difficult at that time for both of us. Her dog (a Chihuahua, I actually love that dog still tbh) also came along, I know it seems stupid to mention it but you know, just a detail of the relationship I guess.

Now at this stage (2012), I am 21 (2012), and currently under the impression that my girlfriend is 26 - a 5 year age difference. I was somewhat cautious of that because even back when I was 21 I still wondered how that might affect the whole ""I want kids"" thing whenever it ended up becoming a thing one of us wanted. I didn't really want to mention the ""kids"" word that early on in a relationship, as it was just too early, so I ignored it for a little while.

&amp;#x200B;

Our relationship progressed over the next couple of years - I definitely grew as a person, we had some pretty big fights which I'm willing to admit that were mostly a result of me being controlling, that was me projecting some insecurities generated by the previous relationship that I was in that, for lack of a better description, was absolutely horrible. I worked through those problems, but she was not without her problems, and didn't really seem to work as hard at changing as I did. I mostly disregarded it, because other people would usually make a point of what an amazing person she was and that I was punching above my weight considerably.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2014, I bought a house and we moved in together. I had taken a really mentally draining job and was being bullied by my managers the whole time I was there, but it was necessary because the pay was good and allowed me to keep the house and support my girlfriend through unemployment. I would come home and collapse on the bed almost instantly, out of sheer mental exhaustion that had somehow transformed itself into physical exhaustion.

I would sometimes get unhappy that I came home to a house that wasn't cleaned or that I was the one making meals most of the time - she wasn't good at cooking things that weren't desserts, and in general she wasn't really able to handle any sort of criticism, so I mostly had to suck it up lest I want to put up her being upset. I'm not going to pretend I'm the most gentle person in the world, infact I can be pretty abrasive, but after being together for that many years I'd have thought the 'stepping on eggshells' times should have been long past us.

&amp;#x200B;

One particularly memorable moment was in 2015, we went to get McDonalds for a late dinner or Sundaes or something one night. After getting out of the drive-thru I parked us up in the car park - a nearby Police car got the idea that I had tried to avoid them and subsequently they came over and RBT'd us (Random Breath Test, alcohol). Standard procedure, they asked for our ID's - I handed mine over but my girlfriend didn't have hers, so she had to give them her name and date of birth verbally. She stuttered a bit when she said her date of birth, but I thought nothing of it.

The police took a while to come back, somewhat normal as I was a person of interest to them due to some bad times in highschool (story for another day). When they came back, it wasn't me they were interested in though. They asked my girlfriend why she gave them false details, because her birth year came back as being 1979, not 1986. She just told them it was a slip of the tongue and they left us alone after that.

So, 3 years into a relationship, my \[29F\] girlfriend is now actually a \[36F\] girlfriend. If there is one thing I do regret in my 20's, it was not treating this revelation with the seriousness it should have been treated with. I guess it's a maturity thing, I knew I'd been lied to but I kind of blew it off and said ""it's ok"" - I guess it was just preferable to being alone. I also know what you're thinking - ""How couldn't you tell?"" - she had mostly everyone fooled, she looks and acts young for her age, at least back then she did.

&amp;#x200B;

2016 - I got a new job that paid very, very well but I also had to sink alot of my life into it - think startup business but I was the only employee kinda thing. The amount of time I was spending at work meant I no longer had the mental stamina to keep doing everything on my own, so I started asking the girlfriend to help out - by this stage she had jobs that amounted to about 20-30 hours of work a week, which was good (I was doing 60-80 hr weeks).

Unfortunately that seemed to prove a very hard thing to ask of her, I couldn't get her to go on a healthy meal plan with me, wouldn't go to the gym with me, house cleaning was optional, she wouldn't do things like lawn-mowing or other garden maintenance shit without a huge argument, and just generally had become massively un-supportive, saying that her job took away all of her time (???). She still had time to dedicate hours and days to making costumes for unpaid photoshoots somehow though. I pointed out the difference in our work hours, and that she was effectively living in the house for $50-$70 a week (extremely cheap here), compared to the $700+ a week I was paying to keep things afloat, but she would just get angry or start crying when I said that stuff, so I gave up on doing that.

Ultimately I ended up with very little to no free-time, and I well and truly ended up drifting away from my social circles and family. Work ended up becoming the only rewarding thing in my life - and I do actually genuinely enjoy what I do, so it was valid as-well.

&amp;#x200B;

I did go on an expenses-paid trip to the other side of the country for work, and I worked a short holiday for myself into it where I got to catch up with my (deceased) dad's side of the family. I also met, for the first time, my half sister (dad's daughter) that I didn't know about until one of her relatives contacted me on Facebook about it a few months earlier. Even though we hadn't grown up together at all, it was pretty clear to me that we were related after maybe 30 minutes of talking, genetics works in fun ways I guess :).

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing that happened this year is that I finally successfully pushed my girlfriend into seeing a gynaecologist - she was in complete denial about her real age and refused to acknowledge the need for things like pap-smears and mammograms and stuff. The primary reason I pushed her into is that she never got her period while we were together, and she wasn't on the pill. She would just tell me 'not to worry about it' - and I guess for a young guy, not needing a condom was nice. But it weighed on my conscience a bit, especially after I found out her real age.

Anyway, the diagnosis came back as premature menopause - and some other issues which meant any potential pregnancy would have been quite dangerous / risky anyway. This is regret number 2 for me - I was still unclear at this stage as to whether or not I wanted kids. My two other half sisters' (mum's daughters) kids are what I considered to be nightmares, for the most part, so I was really put off by the idea them. With that in mind, I told my girlfriend I was OK with not having kids.

&amp;#x200B;

Towards the end of 2018 - my work was acquired by a competitor and I was to be (and have been) brought under their wing to continue doing what I do. I was still pretty emotional about it because a lot of what I had spent almost 3 years working on was going to be wiped out, but that was just the nature of the acquisition. There was also uncertainty, because I would be earning significantly less money in the new company. I had been trying to press my girlfriend to look for a proper full-time job so we could improve our financial situation and maybe have her contribute more significantly toward the household, she didn't really seem to like that idea though.

This whole phase of life was quite stressful, but I had known it was coming since earlier that year - as a result I started relaxing the work hours a little bit and started rekindling old friendships and making new ones. This had resulted in a trip to PAX in Melbourne (Oct 2018) with the boys basically, I was super looking forward to my first break/holiday since 2016. I left my girlfriend with a list of things I wanted to be sorted out in the house while I was gone for 2 weeks (it wasn't an unrealistic list) - the biggest thing on the list is that I wanted her to get our regular plumber out to smash up the bathroom floor and redo all the drainage because it was just buggered and it had been stressing me out - I made it clear that it would be fine if it wasn't finished when I got back.

&amp;#x200B;

I started my trip by visiting my 'newly discovered' half sister and her fiance/husband. They were super cool and I really get along with them, but I am always super apprehensive of interacting with people's kids - they usually give me the shits. Anyway, I met her kids (my niece and nephew) - and well... wow. My nephew has some communication problems and was a little difficult to bond with but he is a sweet kid. My niece... it's like I was looking through a time machine at myself - I just couldn't describe it any way other than she reminded me almost exactly of how I was when I was a kid. A good Uncle probably isn't supposed to have favourites I guess, but I loved every second I got to spend with those kids anyway. I'm probably doing it no justice, but it was truly an eye-opening and heart-warming thing for me. Before long, I lleft to go on the rest of my trip with the boys to blow off 2 years of steam and then headed back home.

&amp;#x200B;

When I landed, I messaged my girlfriend to let her know when I would be home from the airport (she has no drivers license, so Uber it was for me), she messaged back saying cool, etc.

When I got home, I spent almost an hour infront of my own house locked out of it - my girlfriend had decided to go down the road to her mum's and drink there instead of being home when she said she would be there. This pissed me off a bit - planes suck and I needed a shower. When she eventually got back I made it pretty clear that I was unhappy with her, and the first thing I did when I got in the house was go have a shower. It was immediately obvious that the number 1 (and really the only important thing) on the list I left hadn't been done. I decided to just ignore that and bring it up another time. I had my shower, refreshed and came out ready to talk to her - I was super excited to tell her all about meeting my niece and nephew and stuff.

She said she didn't have time to talk because she had to go to pole-dancing lessons with her friend, and within 5 minutes her friend was there to pick her up and off they went. I felt really snubbed by that, I had been gone for 2 weeks and she couldn't put off one pole-dancing class to catch up with me and grab dinner when I got back. It was at this point that I first had the thought of breaking up with her, everything had kind of snowballed and that was just the straw that broke the camels back.

&amp;#x200B;

I did a bunch of soul-searching for the next couple of months. Ultimately I decided that yes I do want kids in the future, ones that are genetically mine. Obviously this flies in the face of what I said in the past about being ok without them, but I guess people tend to change over time and I am no exception. The also very obvious problem is that she can't have kids, not naturally anyway. I ended up doing some research - I'm not quite ready to have kids yet, but perhaps in 4-5 years time - this would make my girlfriend 45 years old. I researched IVF success rates for donor eggs and realised that I would literally need to have access to a money printing machine to even think of being slightly optimistic - and these stats were still for women that were not menopausal. We had previously discussed kids some time back and she also said she would want her kid to be genetically hers. Naturally, considering all the facts, this is a complete logical impasse.

Ultimately, when I thought back, I would not have started dating a woman that was 12 years older than me, even young me knew that would have been a dumb idea. I felt like I had been trapped into all of this by her own dishonesty and irresponsibility - it'd have been nice if I wasn't naive or gullible too. Even if she could have kids, I don't feel like she has the traits needed to be a good parent in my eyes. Call me robotic, but I can't justify throwing away all the financial stability I had worked so hard for over the years for someone that ultimately trapped me into an impossible situation by being dishonest.

&amp;#x200B;

Summing up all of this in my head, I finally made the decision to break up with her in February 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

This was extremely difficult for me to do - for all I've said, I still cared deeply for her, but I clearly wasn't in love, and perhaps had felt a bit jilted by how everything turned out, but it also would have been so much better if things could have just worked out. None of the situation was or is what I wanted.

I wasn't able to verbalise what I wanted to say for her, so I wrote a letter and sat next to her while she read it instead. I apologised to her for not being able to say it out loud (I was literally choking up and had written the letter as a backup in-case I couldn't get the words out). She started crying... and the crying turned into howling. I knew I had really hurt her feelings inspite of trying to be as delicate as I could be. In the letter I had explain that seeing my niece and nephew on my holiday played a big role in changing my mind about having kids, and that I was not financially capable of having them with her. I tried to leave out the negative stuff (like her dishonesty, unsupportiveness, etc) because I didn't want to completely wipe the floor with her, but she cottoned on to there being 'more to it' after a couple of weeks anyway.

Over the next few days, she begged me to stay, said she would change, she would cry, she would say she hates me, then say she loves me. It was extremely difficult, but I had resolved to sticking to my guns - it'd have ultimately been unkind to her to continue the relationship, and dare I say it, unfair to myself as-well.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, she hasn't been particularly mature about the situation - she is is hurt and upset I get it, but it's been 5 months now. Instead of finding a new place to live, she went on a month-long Eurotrip and no longer has a job. As of now (July 2019), she still hasn't moved her stuff out, and I'm a little stuck as a result - I'm not interested in anyone's advice about that particular part of the situation, it just is what it is for now.

One thing that really hits me is that she says that I ""chose"" this, and that what is happening is exactly what I wanted to happen. I tried to explain how it's not, but that doesn't seem to matter to her.

* I packed some mementos away in a box in a hard to reach cupboard.
* Most of her stuff is still in my house packed in a spare-room.
* The hallway she painted pink is still pink, I see it every day. I should probably repaint it.
* There's empty hangers where all the pictures and photos used to be.
* It's winter, so I currently come home to a dark, quiet, cold and empty house.
* I had forgotten how much easier laying next to someone made it to fall asleep.

Sometimes I still look down from my computer desk, expecting to see the little Chihuahua standing there, leaning her head around the corner of the desk looking at me, patiently waiting for me to get up and give her a Shmacko snack in return for doing some tricks, or to let her outside to go pee.

I heard somewhere once that ""Love is like a hot chocolate on a cold winter night"".

I would respond that ""Loneliness is a cold shiver down the spine whilst surrounded by friends"".

But I guess i'll be ok, life has dealt harsher hands to me in the past and I've managed to pull through. Friends have been helping and I'm doing what I can to move on.

I'm not even sure what I expect people to respond to this with other than ""Cool Story Bro"" - I just felt that it was helpful to read other people's stories as part of the healing process. If you're one of those people, I wish you the best. I've spent most of my post-breakup time re-socialising my life and alternating between depressing lo-fi music, synthwave and future funk music, and sim-racing - outside of work atleast. I'm still in the game of doing crazy hours for a startup chasing the dream :) .

109,"Hi I'm turning 21 soon. No car, where I've been handing out my money to people in need (AKA best friends i knew for 10+ years with crippling debt.)

Well after years of it, i found out that all of my friends trash talk me to no tomorrow. ALL of my friends.

Now i cut them off, but i have literally like 1-2 real friends, that's IT.

What steps do i take? I have PTSD, autism, depression (i work out/sleep well/have a healthy diet), ADHD, along with being slightly slow. Doctors even suggest i get dianosed because the school officials claim i have all these problems after numerous testing, but my family never gave me the chance, which would've help me improve my life drastically, all because they didn't wanna accept that I'm retarded. (Teachers/friends/students/family's go-to word for me)

I failed elementary/middle/highschool and got the top 10 worst grades. My whole life I've been harassed by students, until highshool hit. Then it was my parents, teachers, headmasters, guidance councelers, some friends and some family that were bullies (some things haven't changed).

I have 0 social ability, I'm depressed &amp; heartbeoken (ex took advantage and is telling people i beat her up and stuff, even tho all her ex's  ""beat her up"".

So a lot of trust issues, love issues (deadbeat parents) &amp; I'm combating self harm as i have voices in my head. And it doesn't help when people still don't give a gram of care for you at ALL.

What do i do to preserve my mental health and not rot my brain in anymore negativity.

1.) I want therapy. My insurance doesn't cover it, I'm in debt for school &amp; can't afford it.
2.) Having a decent diet, but could be better. Just living off of the cheapest foods along with multivitamins. Also have crippling health problems that I can't afford to fix.
3.) No car, and no local jobs are hiring me. No one is willing to let me work for them, so I'm just..

Lost, i guess. This is the closest i can get to therapy, which does help a lot when i vent.

Opinions/thoughts on where to go from here? Any help would be much appreciated, thanks.",02Jul2019,2
111,"I grew up in a pretty disinterested family where children dont get to do a lot of real world stuff. No money, no interest to make it happen. We where also made to cater for the adults emotional patterns.

When I found out that it’s actually quite normal for kids to act on their interests, I became sad and insecure. It wasn’t that their hobbies or travels cost more money than we had - it was more that I felt and still feel that with such opportunities, you get to become you. An interesting person. I was just made to listen to alcohol monologues. So I concluded that the reality of my life was inferior. 

That kind of perpetuated. I was clearly not in the same place as my peers. I had nothing to show for or tell about. My home life was complicated, I didnt know what to say. So - no friends. No sweetheart. I admired professions like doctors or pilots but knew I “wasn’t like that”. Also had way more immediate problems. 

I am almost 40 now. Job, small life, pay the mortgage. Not one of the things that truly touched me are in my life. The stuff I like to think or talk about is usually for educated people but I dont know such so basically I am really lonely still. 

Now, that old feeling never stopped. I feel like a sicko when it happens but when I see people who DID go to med school or I see children who do what I dreamed of, teens in their dads car with surf gear for thousands of bucks - A specific kind of happy people who seem to know they can go where they want. And no it’s not because I believe they have no problems. But I still feel I am that loser who never got a shot, never got to find my energy and then stopped trying. Sometimes I actually cry the tears I held back as a kid. For seeing children be happy and privileged?!

I dont want to be so ridiculous but people can really trigger me to the point of feeling deeply sad, ashamed and disapointed. I mean, I am an adult. This sucks.",02Jul2019,4

115,"I'm posting this after watching a video where a student got kicked out of class for saying there's only 2 genders. This was a recent video, posted 10 days ago, and it went viral quick.

I am a trans man. I'm also a liberal who is generally tolerant of other people's ideologies, but kids identifying as objects, animals, or cartoon characters does not make them transgender. There is no medical literature on someone being diagnosed with gender dysphoria because they were ''FinnfromAdventureTimegender'', ''stargender'' or what have you. No specialist in their right mind would diagnose someone with gender dysphoria for that, and these are people who work with trans people every day. There is zero medical literature on ''stargender'' or all the other literal thousands of Tumblr genders.

When I say that lots of older people think we're ''crazy'' or we have a ''mental illness'' these loud people thinking identifying as a ball of hydrogen in space makes them trans are part of the problem and to censor people for stating what is scientifically known is about as Orwellian as you can get and you may as well censor people for stating that the crazy guy next door is not the next incarnation of Jesus Christ because he says he's JesusChristgender. 

I would not have as much of a problem with this if it weren't the case that these people try to intermingle with the LGBT community, essentially making a novelty or a mockery out of it, like they want victim status and to feel special, at the expense of making a backhanded insult to trans people (who have been professionally diagnosed with GD).

I've always liked a form of art called pixel art that I started doing when I was around 14 around the same age, I remember telling him (on the phone) that I really like designing stuff and he telling me that design-related careers are worthless, my older brother who is 26 and still live with us (he's kinda lazy to be honest) switched careers when he moved here and end up graduating from a C.C and now he has a stable job with a nice salary yet my dad keeps telling him that he needs to prepare more and sometimes makes comments around me and my sister about how all my brother's friend ""became professionals"" except him. He also told my sister (who has always been an amazing student) that her career was pretty bad because he knew someone who studied that and wasn't making a good salary. I ended up dropping out of college and letting him know about my decision, later on he told me that he was okay with my decision as long as I was going to return to school later on. I really think that being economically stable and independent is very important and I also know how bad the salary of a lot of creativity-related careers tend to be and how worse this turns when you live in New York City. Even prior to moving here I was learning a trade that has absolutely nothing to do with creative stuff, but I ended up not liking it a lot. He also looked down on the institution where I was learning the trade, although two cousins from my mom's side graduated from there and now own their own establishment and they're doing amazing. My mom was even worse than him to me and my sister. I wasn't raised by my dad, he moved here when I was 4 years old and then he and my mom divorced when I was 12 and my sister was 11. Back when I was going to the trade school, I remember waking up early on weekends making my own breakfast and then heading to my cousin's business to put things that I learned during the week at the trade school in practice. She use to tell my sister that I was thinking I was a man and that she couldn't understand how I was waking up early without telling her. She used to force me to go to church on Sundays and whenever I stayed home, she would let me know how dangerous is to leave my sister alone in public transportation by telling me about new articles where girls were either murdered or raped... or both. I've been going to a programming school here in New York and I really put effort to make improvement, get a nice job, become independent while i follow my dream of making a living out of creative stuff. Neither my sister or i are lazy people. We keep the apartment in order and clean it almost every saturday morning. Since the store closed i've been working with my dad who is now self employed helping him with bookeeping type of tasks. When driving home he's always complaining about the traffic lights, taxes and how ""the system"" works here. Sometimes when i come back from getting an haircut he lets me know how he thinks i ""got robbed"" cause my head looks the same. I started going to the gym a few months ago and when i told him about it he told me that he used to go to that particular gym and that it was always crowded. Sometimes i feel unmotivated and it scares me the fact that i don't feel the same way when doing pixel art anymore. I tend to tell myself that i am being self centered and that i shouldn't complain. I really want to know if that is the case and if you guys have any advice to motivate myself and those arround me.",02Jul2019,1

120,"(TL:DR Below)

So I pretty much ""graduated "" 12th grade (I'm homeschooled) a couple weeks ago and I'm already feeling lost. I don't know what I want to do now that I'm almost 18. I  want to get a part time job or something but  we don't have a car meaning I don't know how to drive which seriously limits things due to where I live because there's no reliable public transportation. 

Also due to me being homeschooled, I don't have any friends which gets pretty lonely sometimes. I never really had a close childhood friend growing up and I'm not good at socializing with those around my age which probably contributes to me having social anxiety.  It's summertime here and everyone's out having fun or doing exciting things and I'm in my room on the internet as usual. 

I am interested in  art and wouldn't mind taking courses but I don't have anything saved for it and I don't know if it's the smart choice career wise. /End rant

It’s hard. It’s going to be hard. But I need to understand that things will only look up when I look up. Things will never get better if I continue this behaviour. If I want to build new relationships and new friendships in the near future, I need a better attitude and better outlook. 

Like I said, this won’t be easy, not at all.. especially with all that’s “wrong” with me. But I need this and if I don’t at least try, then what am I doing with my life? 

It’s time to change, and use my past relationships as learning tools. Enough is enough. This doesn’t only go for me, but also for you! Make that change NOW!",02Jul2019,21
122,"I grew up in a very conservative and religious family. During my early teenage years, my religion (a minority religion) had a lot of influence on me. I barely looked in the mirror to contemplate my appearance. I didn't wear properly (in fact I wore clothes that my religious book told me to wear). I was so into religious issues and I mocked people who followed what I then called ""the temptations of life"".

In my final teenage years, science and philosophy changed my life. I and my brother discovered the deception we were sinking in and we let go of our beliefs.

Afterwards, I entered through a shock. Life and existence was too much for me to process. From one philosophy to another, I finally had my values set and I was ready to go, but little did I know about the practical things that were waiting for me.

The second negative thing I did is that I started working blindly on travelling to a more tolerant country rather than fixing the insecurities religion raised in me. I thought I had to travel, first, because I'm a non-believer in a community full of extremists. Second, because I'm gay. Yeah!

Nothing worked, though. I'm still in the society I grew up in.

I had to go to a university near my hometown to build something in my life. There, I met people from the LGBTQ+ community who changed my life. I don't know why I directly came out to them, but I did.It helped me overcome a lot of troubling thoughts,  at the same time, however, it pushed me into another crisis: dating life and physical appearance. how do I look? Will I ever date someone? Am I attractive to other guys?

I'm short and I really don't have a problem with that cz I'm attracted to guys that are my height. I don't know about my physical appearance, though. I see myself in hundred different forms. Sometimes I look handsome in the mirror and in many other times, I look at myself and I wish I was dead.I don't know how to take care of myself. Can't ask for my friends help because I'm afraid that their mild toxic behavoir would make things worse. Even my barber is so masculine and doesn't how to match hairstyles to people's looks.

I'm going to the GYM now! I still need to figure out how to take care after myself. Grooming, clothes, etc.I don't know if what I'm doing is correct. What mindset should I have? and How should I approach this issue?

124,"A couple of months ago, my brother (who is also my roommate), decided it would be a good idea to allow his best friend to stay over, without paying rent. This has caused all different sorts of problems that I won’t even go into.

Fast forward to yesterday, I got off my 10 hour shift, and came home to my room being completely torn apart. My brother took many of my belongings and claimed them as his. His reason - “you’re not paying rent”. Which was untrue. He even took my money order receipts. In the midst of me taking what I could, he was justifying reasons to keep some of my things. When I disagreed, he hit an object I had up into my face, which gashed my eyebrow. 

I called my local police department, who arrived, but they must have known and darted out before the 2 officers arrived. 

At this point, I was thinking whatever. Just get me off the lease and I’ll find somewhere else to live. I gathered my belongings and headed over to the neighbors, who let me stay last night. 

This morning, I spoke to the property manager. She told me she’s going to be following through with the eviction process unless A) we paid this month of rent, and B) he removed his friends from the property. But for me to be taken off the lease, *he has to agree and sign*

I ran into him 20 minutes ago. I very casually stated if he can sign me off the lease, I’ll pay half of the rent, and she won’t evict us. He walked away, because that’s how he operates.

I told him I was going to press assault charges if he didn’t, to which he said “do what you have to do”...

Contacted the local police dep. And he left, once again. Unsure of whether or not he’ll be returning.

At this point, I don’t think there’s anything I can do.

Because of my older brother, I will have an eviction on my record, tanking my credit &amp; chances of ever renting a place moving forward. Because of my older brother, I have a gash above my eye that very well could need stitching.

130,"Really a stupid thing to complain about because people are just attracted to what they’re attracted to, and god knows women have a ton of crazy fucking standards to live up to, but man I fucking hate that the most common trait that can define a guy’s attractiveness is confidence. I feel like it really feeds into society’s whole perception that guys have to be these strong, immovable forces that are unwavering, able to stand against scrutiny without giving an inch and handling everything life throws at them with a wink and a smile. I’ve always just really struggled to be a confident guy, I always put myself down, to the point my friends worry about how badly I see myself, and it’s so ingrained into my personality at this point that it’s almost impossible to change. I’m not a shy guy, and I get along really well with most everyone I meet, but I really just am not a confident person. I don’t know how I’d ever build up confidence about myself. It just seems alien to me.

I get people say that true confidence has to come from within, but really it’s hard to develop that when for 20 years I’ve been shown time and time again, with a couple of fleeting drunken exceptions that mean fucking nothing, that women just don’t see me that way in general. That’s not a bash against women; this is much in the same vein as society teaching men that only curvy yet thin, perfectly unblemished, always smiling and sickly sweet women are the ideal to strive towards. It’s hard to fight that image of what a perfect man or woman should be when it’s hammered into our heads over and over and over. For us guys It’s a self-sustaining cycle either way I feel: you can either have this ingrained confidence in yourself and who you are, which leads to people being attracted to you, which then fuels the growth of your confidence further, or you can be lacking that confidence, leading people to not be attracted towards you, and causing you to see that as proof that you’re right and that you have every reason to be unconfident. My whole personality has kind of come to revolve around owning my slight awkwardness, laughing it all off, and it’s made me a decently liked dude who’s seen as funny and outgoing, but who women kind of pity in some way and want to comfort rather than tear my clothes off lmfao. Deep down  behind the laughs I’m a deeply unconfident, self-pitying, moderately depressed wreck, and it sucks that for a lot of guys the one key personality trait that can define who’s attracted to you is the one that can only come from being a self-assured, rounded person, when so many guys struggle with their own issues and can’t live up to that bullshit persona.

Guys are people too man. We get unconfident. We feel like shit about ourselves sometimes. And I feel like a lot of us don’t hear it enough, because society kind of judges our value based off whether we already value ourselves, and so the loneliest people often go on being the loneliest in a nasty cycle. But just because you’re not confident in yourself all the time, that you’re maybe not always making the best decisions or being sure in yourself, that you feel like you can’t uphold that facade of being a perfectly functioning person all the time; it’s okay. Even though you might not get told it very often, if at all, or you don’t quite realise it for yourself because society almost never goes out its way to explicitly make this clear to you; you are worthy of love. Everyone is. Being unconfident doesn’t make you an inherently unlovable person; it makes you flawed like all the rest of us, and fuck what society has ingrained in us to make us think otherwise.",02Jul2019,6

I’m so envious of my attractive friends with healthy, not inflamed and scarred and red diseased skin with money and partners. I haven’t even developed a funny self depricating self ironic personality. I haven’t done anything to help myself because im selfish, not that theres anything i could do anyway. I literally have nothing. And then I’m called selfish if I complain. Meanwhile my desirable rich friend who literally lives in a mansion with rich parents who doesnt have anything to complain about complains to me about the most arbitrary shit imaginable like im supposed to care. And i do care, i love her. Which mkes me feel even worse for being jealous and despising her. She doesnt even have any personality flaws. I just cant compare. I know theres no hope, i do. And the worst thing is nothing will ever make it better, and i know that. I know im ugly, i told my mom about how my appearence is making me suicidal, and she asked me if that means i think ugly people should just off themselves. So she basically shamed me for telling her. I’ll never be as attractive as my friends. And when i read about depression i always hear that being sad isnt the same as being depressed, and i know im thinking about killing myself every day. Is that enough? But then again i dont even want to be diagnosed with depression cuz that would just add to the list pf things wrong with me and i should probably just kill myself right now.

135,"I’ll try and be brief.  Tldr at the end. I’ve been hanging out with a new group of people for the summer. One of my good friends from high school (call him Ed) met some people through one of his clubs and we’ve been having a great time all summer (going to be a junior in college in the fall). However, there are a few girls in the group and I took interest to one of them but decided to back off for reasons. Then it comes out later that Ed is going to ask that same girl out (call her Sara) and Ed knew I was into Sara so he asked if he could ask her out. I said he could and thought it was fine. 

However, since then, I’ve been hanging out with that group a lot less (just seems like not as much is happening), but then every once and while Sara will mention to me “oh how come you didn’t hang out with us this day” and it just be like “oh I didn’t know” oh well no big deal. But now this is the third time in the last two weeks this has happened (two weeks since Ed told me his feelings for Sara). So naturally I talk to Ed and he tells me about them hanging out and I’m like “oh you went nice, you should tell me next time”, but now he says “oh I told you... you must have forgot”. Okay again no big deal the first time maybe I truly did forget. But then the same thing happens again and again (those three times in two weeks all with the same “oh I told you”). 

I could care less about the girl stuff I just want to hang out with my friends but it’s kinda tough rn. Im thinking just to wait a little longer see if it keeps happening. If it does I think I’ll talk to him make sure everything’s okay. Or per the title a part of me says I’m just overthinking it. So lmk what is goin on?

142,"Firstly, I'm on my phone so I apologise for shitty format. Secondly, this is really just a rant because I need it all said. That being said, it's going to be really fucking long and a TLDR will be at the bottom. 

So this post is mainly about my dad. I'm really writing this because I've been lying in bed for 20 minutes just thinking of writing it.


Now, a little backstory on my dad, for those that may want to sympathize with him:
My dad served 4 years in Yugoslavia and his father died of a drug overdose when he was 9, plus his step-father is a bit of a narcissistic prick at times and has always been very fond of the ""Boys will be boys"" thing, so my father may not have gotten the love and attention that he needed, plus he may have needed a psychologist after Yugoslavia.

When I was young I was a total daddy's girl and I cried when I waved goodbye once he left us, my brother and I, at our mum's house. But later, from the age of 11 and up, possibly, he started telling me things like how much money he owed his parents for the house and for a lawyer in his divorce with my mum. He's been drinking beer every day almost for as long as I can remember. It wasn't until I was 15 that I really recognized that he's an alcoholic. Because he isn't a bad alcoholic, really, but he'd get drunk most days when we were with him (5 days with him, 9 with our mother). He'd cry sometimes when I sat in the living room with him and tell me about shitty things he'd seen in Yugoslavia. Things a child really doesn't need to know. 

Around when I turned 15 he also started telling me about his sex life. I have specifically told him I did not want to hear about it. He'd keep insisting, saying it's good to know these things and told me about his shitty sex life with my mum.

Eventually it got to the point where he started buying anime figurines of the feminine kind with huge boobs and barely any clothing. Fair enough, right? If he'd kep them in his bedroom, perhaps. They are standing on glass shelves in the living room and dining room for everyone to see. It got to the point where I couldn't even invite friends over anymore because he had a full-fucking-human-sized sex doll sitting on the chair next to his computer because ""Well, you don't play WoT with me anymore and it's lonely sitting in here.""


Some major things happened when I was 15:
I got a psychologist and I directly told him I wasn't going to come talk to him instead, when he told me I could just do that instead. He also asked me if I thought he was a good parent. I said no. He got sad. 

He stopped drinking beer because he wanted to lose weight, but instead started drinking rum and coke and he basically stopped eating, to lose weight. 

He gave me a fucking vibrator because ""You're not like the other girls, u/MegaMindGame, you don't express yourself in a feminine way and I really think you should use this."" and refused to let me throw it out.

My father came crying to my room and told me that had it not been because he had my brother and I, he would've killed himself.

He joined a socializing-club-thing that we'll call Gamers. Now, he made no effort in trying to hide that Gamers is a BDSM club. Basically, you meet up with people who are into BDSM and maybe hit it off with some people and get a sexy relationship. He told us all about it and started making whips on our dining table that he could sell to people in Gamers.

Finally, being that he stopped eating completely, there was rarely food in the fridge for when my brother and I stayed with him and the only time in my life before we moved out, he told me to shut up. He told me to shut up because I told him that starving himself to lose weight isn't healthy. It may not be that big of a deal, but it had a big impact on me.


When I was sixteen, my brother and I decided that we'd had enough and we moved to live with our mother 100% of the time. Being that my father had told me he'd been close to killing himself, I was fucking terrified of moving out, but I couldn't stand being there. It made me uncomfortable just to be at home.

My mother (bless that woman, I bloody love her) has also later told me about the horrible things my father and step-grandfather has done to her during the divorce. Didn't make it better.
Brother and I basically completely stopped visiting our grandparents because I generally dislike them and I don't believe my brother likes them all too much, either.
Even after my brother has told them what our father has done and what he's like, explained why we've moved out, they stick with our father. Had a very passive aggressive meeting with them not long ago. Step-grandfather had the audacity to say that we could see him as a hero for those 4 years in Yugoslavia.

It felt good to hear their opinion with my own two ears.

I also had a shitty conversation with my father via text, to which I later told him, in person, that some of the things said and done, I can't forgive him for. He just said ""That's okay"".

I'm feeling much better now and I don't have a psychologist anymore. 


TLDR:
Father is in no way parent material and tells his children adult stuff about what he's seen in war, sex, his unstable mentality etc. Shitty grandparents stick up for him. Brother and I moved to live with mum and we're doing good.",02Jul2019,4

I’m totally struggling with mental health right now and I think I’m being needy and just boring but that is no one else’s responsibility but my own.

144,"I'm not sure if this is a rant or a cry for help. Probably both. I just don't care. I'm currently at summer break in my house (going to junior year in high school), I don't try to do anything productive, I don't want to try, I don't see the point in trying, and there is nothing there that helps push me. Friends have tried to get me up and going, but it'll work for a week or so and then I'll be back in my old routine of nothing.

I don't even care about doing sports at my school. I just don't have a lot of option. I currently 6'3 and skinny. Earlier this year, I went to all the spring ball practice for football and work out with them all spring. After ALL these months of practice. The coach told my brother, behind my back, that the only good thing I was useful was FOOTBALL MANGER. This just killed off my motivation for doing Football at my school. As a result, I haven't been going to any summer practice or weight training or ANYTHING. I just don't care about doing football anymore. I made a lot of friend doing it but what the point if the coaches are just going to bring you down.

I don't care about being with friends or making new connections- I did at the beginning and I really liked doing it, but now everyone has settled in to their places and the whole ""meeting new people to make friends"" thing has kind of died down. I don't have any success in girls. I never had a girlfriend in my life or someone who even liked me. I don't have as much fun at high school as I should. My friends don't trust me with anything calling me ""goofy"" or some other insult (Not to mention the whole school treat me like some kind of monster or stranger). They never invite me to anything, as a result, I missed out at everything.

I have lots of things I want to learn and do with my life, but I can't even bring myself to do what I'm required to do. I just feel like wasted space with no interest in bettering myself or being a productive member of society.

And even when I do get out of these holes, which happens somewhat often, it's only temporary and then I fall back in to the same habit of not caring about anyone or myself. I have no money, no one who really cares about me, girls find me weird and creepy, shitty clothes, shitty grades, (GPA is 1.4), now matter how hard I tried to gain weight. I always end up skinny, and the worst part of it? It's not even that I hate any of this. I hate feeling like this, but not even enough to do something about it. I hate my grades, but it's not like Ds look different from As when you receive your diploma. No one really cares about me (especially in the way that I feel I need. It's been months since someone told me they liked me and I blew it!!!), so why should I care about myself anymore? Clearly I'm not good enough for anyone, yet for some reason that's good enough for me.

One of the main things i did when i was young that I still cringe to this day is how I would ask out girls. Would I write a letter like a romantic No, would I build up my confidence and ask face to face I wish. What I did as a young lad was get the girl's number and then ask her on a date OVER TEXT it wasn't till near the end of senior year that one of my closest friends told me that I should do it face to face. Now is this a major reason why the 20+ girls I've asked out through out middle and high school rejected me probably not but I swear to God it has to be a least one of the reasons why.",02Jul2019,1
146,"I was on my motorcycle going through a green light and the yummy truck just decided to turn through. It's not like I was splitting Lanes or anything just driving normal. Didn't have to to chase him down, he stopped when he heard that I was coming for him. I had my headphones and he was trying to talk to me I didn't hear a single thing he said the entire time. I just flipped my helmet up told him that he almost killed me and watch out.

While I was driving away all I really was thinking about was, what if I would have died that right there, would have been really nice.",02Jul2019,3
