1,"\*\*\*\***I am safe.** I have a good therapist and psychiatrist who know about everything I’m about to say. I also have a supportive family and friends. 

tl;dr: All those ""passive"" thoughts of suicide were much more dangerous than I thought.

I was having ""little"" suicidal thoughts. Just passing ones. I thought I didn’t have a “plan” to kill myself. But in asking myself if I had a plan, and thinking about all the methods I was not planning to carry out, I inadvertently narrowed down the list of methods to the ones that were accessible to me. And then those ""little"" suicidal thoughts unexpectedly became ""big"" in the space of an evening. The plan I “didn’t have” was still there. It was literally within reach. It was on my night stand. 

It was like when you’re standing on a high place and you think, “I could jump.” And normally, that’s just the “call of the void” (*l'appel du vide*)*.* There are so many other things you can imagine doing *besides* jumping, so you go do one of those things instead. 

But what if you don't see another way off the high place, besides jumping off? When you can't take being up there any longer, you'll jump, because it's the only thing you can do. So, as soon as I started to doubt I could get off the ledge, I was already at risk of jumping, even though I was still scared to do it. 

I have been hurting for a very long time, as in 11.4% of my life, which seems like a small fraction until you experience it. In reality, it's long enough to forget how you felt before the most recent 11.4%. 

I still don't see a way to finally stop hurting, outside of death. But the people I trust keep telling me there is one. I'm trying so fucking hard. Please get help if you have ""little"" thoughts of suicide, because they absolutely can sneak up and vibe check you on the noggin.",05Dec2019,1

5,"As I sat in introspection thinking about how I used to play this game in childhood, and never having been able to tag anyone and always be tagged, and then finally wind up quitting the game out of frustration and indifference , I realized how the game could be compared to life. All the time I’ve been chasing things I wanted but could never seem to reach, and always being pursued by the things I never wanted to be a part of. When I do give up, I’m the one at fault for being ‘too lazy’ to continue the charade. It’s a violent and endless cycle, really, and I really wish I was never part of it. Because I never get what I aim for and I usually get what I never asked for. In the end, I’m still the bad guy for not wanting to play the game despite being coaxed into it.",05Dec2019,1

Saturdays are typically our fun day and Sunday is spent with laundry and cleaning and meal prep. Last Saturday was the first one he worked, I took it upon myself to clean and do laundry for him so he could have more relaxing time on Sunday. When he came home I told him I did these things and explained that if he felt he needed to do them again that I wouldn’t get upset. He had a strange reaction, more like shock I guess. He didn’t say much at the time and didn’t redo what I had done. Tonight in conversation I said I wouldn’t do it again cause I thought he wasn’t happy with it. Well I was wrong, he said I did a good job and that it helped make him feel much calmer and he was so happy to have more time to spend with me.

10,Until now.... let’s give a bit of background. I started dating my highschool boyfriend freshman year of highschool and we were on and off (never for more than a few weeks) for four and a half years. We ended up getting engaged but I called it off because there were a lot of problems he didn’t want to acknowledge or fix. I ended up starting something with an old friend a month after and tried to keep it casual but quickly fell head over heels for him. More than I ever was with my ex fiancé. Then flash forward a year and a half later he decides to join the army and break up with me “for my own good” because he didn’t think it would be fair to me. Worst I’ve ever felt in my life. But somehow I ended up in another casual thing three weeks after that ended. To be fair my ex pushed me to move on. And I thought by doing that it would help both of us. Casual thing lasts for a couple months until he called it off a few days ago because he met someone else. Weirdly heartbroken...Even though I didn’t really like him all that much outside of friendship. Now I’ve decided it’s for my own good to force myself to be single and on my own for at least 6 months to a year. But... I need some advice or motivation maybe. If you’re happily single or content with being by yourself please give me some advice or tell me your story.,05Dec2019,1
12,"I'm not really sure what happened, but for the past 6 months, I've been just getting to bedtime. Lately, I am seeing myself go to my phone more and more and rely on movies more and more.

I knew the movie thing was going to happen. After about 2.5 years of being a no TV except for 30 minutes of highly educational TV at about 18 months, we introduced movies. And I fell sick two times in the last 2 or so months we introduced movies and... well it was so ridiculously easy and I justified it by how good I was doing before now. This all ends now. The reason why I was so good before was because I never succumbed to this mindset. Time to reverse this mindset and stick to the one movie a week for family night. No excuses.

I've also been heavily relying on storytime, gymnastics, swim class and dance class to keep my occupied by using the same justification. Since I do all of these things, I don't have to worry about digging my head into my phone. And, again, the reason I did so good before was because I did not have this mindset.

These past 6 months I saw myself get progressively worse and worse and I see the behavior change in my kid. For the first 3 months, she was fine and did fine because I wasn't so bad, but the 3rd month is really went I slipped and, like I said, I got sick 2 times in the last two months and... really slipped. I needed to put on a movie or two to get schoolwork done as well. She is starting to have bad behavior that I never had to deal with before and it is because of this. She wants more attention than what I am giving. And, she deserves more attention than what I am getting.

That is why I am going to make a schedule, right down to the minute, of when I am home from work of what I am going to do. And, I am going to stick with it, just like I did for the first 2ish years of her life. I will have backup plans for when I am sick - I wl save the low effort activities for those days.

I am going to change. I have to. My daughter is insanely ahead, but that is no reason to justify me being lazy. She has so much to learn and so many new things to do an explore - there is no way I'm going to be the one to stunt this. Not a chance. And I am starting now, I have to have better bedtime practices to maximize my sleep so I have more energy, patience and understanding. Good night!",05Dec2019,1

14,"We’ve been best friends for a long time. I’m currently in the military, so I “disappear” (submarines) for months on end. Since this happens pretty often, I’ve never been able to firmly establish any kind of relationship with her beyond just friends. 

We click so incredibly well. Every once in a while we randomly get on the topic of her sex life and she always tells me how all the guys she’s ever with don’t want anything serious. They either flake out, straight up tell her they don’t want a relationship, or she actually loses interest in them. She always tells me she just wants someone who just want to be with her instead of just being a fling. 

I am in actual pain talking to her sometimes. She asks me for advice with her failed relationships all the time, and I give her the best advice I can because I just want her to be happy, whether it’s with me or not. I’d give her the world if my job didn’t take me away from it all the time. She lives almost 3 hours from me. I have 2 and a half years left in the Navy.

21,"Hey all, long time lurker hoping to just bounce off some ideas and collect thoughts from you all. I recently learned that I (24M) have a genetic condition which predisposes me to weak vessels that can rupture, particularly the aorta (biggest artery in your body that comes out of your heart). I have had imaging done that already shows substantial enlargement, and replacement surgery likely isn’t too far into the future. 

In learning this, I was told that I will likely be limited in what physical activity I can do - namely, I have been advised against activities that raise my HR &gt; 120 (which really isn’t that high - fast walking will usually get most people here) and any weightlifting, and will likely have to be on a Med that helps me achieve this. 

I’ve been struggling a lot with all of this. One of my biggest achievements in life was losing 100lb via diet and exercise, and hiking and running are two extremely important things in my life. Knowing that they may not be possible ever again with these restrictions has really getting me down, and over the last three weeks I’ve fallen back into some bad eating habits I haven’t had in years - which is extremely atypical for me. 

It’s difficult finding people that I can connect with in similar circumstances. I just wanted to share and welcome any comments/experiences/stories. Thanks

tl;dr - recently found out I have a genetic condition that predisposes me to weak blood vessels; likely will need surgery in the near future. Was given lifelong recs not to exert myself physically. Running and hiking are extremely important to me, and knowing I shouldn’t and can’t be doing these is bumming me out.",05Dec2019,1
23,"I work an eight hour job. Half the time I have two days off in a row, the other half I either have one day off a week or two days off a couple days a part. 

I am physically exhausted. I eat fairly healthy (I moved back in with my parents, who are actually nutritionalists) and I’m young (25yrs.) 

I sleep around 7-9 hours a night, undisturbed. But my job is physically demanding, lifting 20-60lb all day and constantly bending down. I need to go to physical therapy for my knees, for patellofemoral pain syndrome, but how can I go when I don’t have any time off? I don’t want to spend hour at the hospital and two hours driving there and back when I only have one day off. Because of it, my lower back hurts, causing my upper back to hurt, and my feet. I broke my ankle a year ago and it never healed properly. 

I have a cat and several dogs who are my joy and my world, but I don’t even get to do anything with them anymore. I am too tired to walk them, to tired to wrestle them, too tired to do anything. I just give them things to chew on and my cat just cuddles me. 

My eyes are so heavy. I can’t do my hobbies, I would literally just sleep all day if I could. I almost fell asleep driving from work today. I’m starting to say stupid things, jumble my words, snap at my parents. I can’t drink energy drinks because I have tachycardia, and I could drink coffee and black tea all day and I’d be just as tired. 

If I go to the doctor, they’ll just tell me the same thing they have for years: “excessive daytime sleepiness”, but they won’t give me anything for it, they won’t do anything about it, they’ll just tell me “oh, it’s this” and take my bloodwork, then tell me everything is normal.

25,"
I’m a skinny white side with hEDD (hypohidrotic EctoDermal Dysplasia) which effects the hair nail skin teeth and sweat glands(I cannot sweat at all). I got a very mild kind and I’m thankful for that but at some times I get weird looks from people but I dismiss it knowing that I stand out for the wrong reasons but sometimes it gets to me because I would be alone wanting to reach out to someone but worry they’d be weirded out so I didn’t try, complex relationships with girls wasn’t a thing for me. This all lead to me being some what socially awkward but once you chat with me you’ll know I’m still a human that is helpful, etc...

Thankfully I wasn’t left with the scraps of the gene pool but was giving a gift to which I thought at first was more of a curse since it would always bother, get in the way, drawing unwanted attention to me especially when I started to do track &amp; field in Middle School (7th&amp;8th grade). As I went into High School (9th-12th grade) it just kept getting more awkward and embarrassing, so when I started doing Marching Band (got really damn good at it !!Euph’s FTW!!) it’s was a hell of sort but I kept going on and finished each year proud and enjoying the PG’ness of band camp practices. 

School to me has always been enjoyable especially when you’re in band but it’s challenging when teens are being super judgmental but never mean to me. It was a nice/odd complex of exclusion yet peace. As school month went on I hit my late blooming period with a “bang” to which I wasn’t ready for and didn’t know how to cope with it so I kept it to myself and did my best to solve to new issues that literally arose from nowhere at anytime. This only lead me to now excluding myself from certain social events and just keeping quiet to myself all while the gift kept going. I got through the years by myself making “friends” along the way, it’s more like people that are kind and know I’m a smart kid that can help, whilst still struggling in some classes (r.i.p. English). I wasn’t bad at these topics it’s just simply that I didn’t turn in homework’s or certain large individual projects which would tank my grade but I overcame that some how and would always pass “by the skin of my teeth” as my mother would like to say. She’s the best mother I could ever ask for. As I was saying I would always just pass and I was fine because I don’t know why I just felt okay with that but all I knew is that it’ll be a challenge later on in my education... uhh yeah got Eagle Scout, yay!... uhh... things that aren’t PG13, uhh... I’m not sure, this is a late night venting post that I probably wouldn’t do if I was full awake and thinking clearly but hey when life gives a chance you either go for it or you don’t and you’ll try again later...

26,I took an acting class in college because I wanted to challenge myself and overcome any social anxiety or fear of public speaking. One of the “tests” was to memorize and act out a monologue. We did it a total of three times throughout the course of the semester. The first one was just the professor directing us through the monologue and there was no need to memorize. The 2nd rehearsal was memorization but the professor still helped direct. The first rehearsal I didn’t mind failing that much. The second one just made me heartbroken because I just couldn’t act right and the nerves just made everything worse.  I knew taking this class would be challenging for me but I didn’t know it would be that difficult for me to handle. It was pretty hard watching my class mates do it almost effortlessly even though I’m sure they were nervous too.  I was very bent out of shape because of it. The third rehearsal was the final for the class and I left no stone unturned. I didn’t want to feel that same way I did on the 2nd performance. I practiced the lines over and over and felt more confident. We were doing the final today and I was 6th on the list to go.  My heart started beating fast as fuck and I felt like throwing up as the list got shorter. I thought the practice was for nothing and I was gonna choke again. It was my turn and I was prepared for the worst. I said the first 4  words of the monologue and it was over before I knew it. All the nerves went away and I was in character. The professor was impressed by my performance and said I improved so much. I felt at ease as if the shame of my last performance was lifted off my shoulders. It’s not much but I feel I conquered the impossible.,05Dec2019,1
27,"I got back from the thanksgiving long weekend ready to power through two weeks of academic hell - finals, papers, events to organize; the general chaos of dead week and finals week. All I've been thinking about is when I finally get to go home, how I'll stay in my pjs all day and revel in stress-free glory. Maybe do something wild like make meringues and release all the stress from the semester as I whack the tray of little tiny treats on the counter to get out the air bubbles.

32,"I forgot that I was until tonight's DnD session. 

Growing up I recall that I always wanted things to go my way (which I mean who doesn't) but I never could handle losing well. I'd get really frustrated and angry and kinda shut down. I don't think I ever did any outbursts, but people could tell I was not very happy. Textbook definition of a pouting sore loser. 

I suppose I never really got over that part of me.  I stopped doing competitive stuff in grade school, including multiplayer games. I convinced myself that I just didn't like multiplayer games/competitive stuff, but reflecting now I think it was because I was often very bad at them and hated losing all the time. I remember one time I even tried Minecraft Hide and Seek and that got me upset and I haven't played since, lol. 

I also remember starting to purposely distance myself from whatever competitive thing I was doing to soften the blow of losing. Like ""None of this matters/ I don't want to win anyway"" stuff. But of course I would still feel a little happy if I did win. If I didn't: Oh well. No big deal. I didn't care anyway ~~supposedly~~.

I always like to be in control, and I always like to be the ""hero"" character. I guess that's why I mostly play single player RPG games. But when it comes to expanding that roleplay to include other people, I don't always take it well. I'm still new to DnD and roleplaying, but I'm a shy quiet dude. I'm also awful at improvising, so that comes at a real disadvantage when it comes to battling. I'll just sit and let the other members hash out plans (that often go nowhere because we're all silly and easily distracted, lol) that would sometimes put my character in an awful position, or when it came to my turn to do something I couldn't think of anything at all. Both of these situations sometimes end up with my character not in the best scenarios and getting beat up. Tonight that kinda happened, and I realized I was really annoyed about it; much more than I should have been. I also find myself annoyed that I'm not as strong as I planned out my character to be (I definitely made my character's background OP) but now that I think about it, that's how it should be! I should have been more humble in my backstory or at the very least not make a quick thinking strong heroic character if I am neither quick witted, strong, or heroic in my roleplaying skills.

I end up putting my characters (aka self inserts most of the time) on this invincible pedestal. (I think I've gotten a little better in making well rounded characters as I've grown, but not much.) I mean its nice to be strong, but that often ends up with me making the whole story around myself and it's very flat or predictable. I guess what I'm saying is that its easier to make myself feel good and strong in a story I write because I'm in full control. Once that control is gone in a multiplayer setting, I'm not flexible enough to handle it well. That's not good because no one wants to play with a sore loser. (Which is probably another reason why I stayed away from competitive stuff so that no one would find out I'm a sore loser.)

So fuck. Now what do I do to get over that? I know I'll get better at roleplaying the more I do it, but I don't know if that will address being a sore loser. It feels really childish, ha. Hopefully I'll figure it out soon.",05Dec2019,1
33,"I'm a 30/m and became single in January. My long term girlfriend of 7 yrs broke up with me in January. I'm still currently dealing with issues from that as well which may be leasing to strike of these issues. She took my virginity as well as my first kiss. She lost her virginity earlier that year at 19 yr to a friend of mine and I ended up being the 5th guy she slept with that year. She was dating another guy when hooked up a couple times before officially getting together. In reality she didn't even want to date me, just hook up at parties at her house, but I convinced her to be with just me. It took me a while to just get over the fact she lost her virginity to a friend of mine then pursed me. 

We were faithful to just each other for the next 7 yrs. Now that I'm single again and kind of want to date again I realize I have no idea how to date. I didn't know how to do it in high school, college, or let alone an adult. We were together through the rise of the dating apps which seems to be where the real Hook-Up culture took off. I'm not completely sure of this because I seem to be completely oblivious to such things. 

I began trying to research how to date. I've watched YouTube videos on charisma and dating couches for male and females. It kills me on what they say. I just don't want to believe that this stuff is true. They go over the psychological of dating and they both seem to imply the same thing. That anyone could be attracted to anyone and is just a matter of time before they took-Up with someone perceived  ""better"" than you. Other videos I've seen is S.O. reveal their partner count or interview friends with benefits. That seem to back the coaching up.

For the male ones it seems to be more pick up artist type of deal. They talk of how to get women to pursue you by using tease/flirt systems to peak interest. They also talk of how to portrait yourself as an ""alpha."" I didn't want to believe this works, but I work in a male dominated field and one day they were giving me unsolicited advice and it was everything those coaches were saying. It is essentially have sex with as many women until you find the one you want to be with. I feel like such a scum bag for knowing this knowledge now. 

The female dating coach essentially says the same thing but in a way to not scare men off. He said its a catch 22 but men want women to be innocent/pure but also a demon in bed. So he talks about how to ease a man's mind about you (woman) slept around without losing your innocents. So basically sleep with as many guys until you find the one you like.

The MGTOW videos express much of the same ideas but kind of in a condescending way. They talk of young women wanting to ""ride the dick carousel"" until they want to settle down with the nice guy. I'm not against people men or women expressing their sexuality. And college makes sense as a time I your life to try that. But now it just seems to be the norm.

Both caches and my work friends (which is practically a frat house) talk about dating with the same mentally. Date multiple people at the same time while simultaneously randomly hooking up. I'm 30 yrs old now, and feel like that's cheap and scummy thing to do. 

It really seems that with the dating apps that the culture is now sleep with someone then try to get to know them. I don't feel like I can emotionally or physically do this. I had a chance to but I couldn't physically preform. Thinking back it took 3 tries with my long term gf for it to work. I'm not saying I would like to only date virgins, just women that haven't hooked up with every guy they thought was kind of cute/cool. I know must people are not virgins and I would almost more of a ""don't ask don't tell"" when it comes to your body count.  Is this tool much to ask or are my views on relationships just too romanticized on what they actually are? Or possibly I have serious hang ups on sex in general? Is sex not really suppose to make you feel like you're special to a person?

TLDR: Do I need to get over myself about the hook-Up/online dating scene? Do I care took much about how many people a potential girl has slept with? Are my views on sex/relationships outdated from the internet?",05Dec2019,1

42,"I’m still head over heels for J and I’m not really interested in moving on. Not yet. Even if we decided we were officially “over,” I’d still have a hard time imagining myself with someone else at this point in time. I invested a lot of my heart into what I *thought* we had... I allowed myself to start dreaming about a future with him, something that I just don’t do. Not anymore... I don’t open myself up to people like that unless they make me feel safe enough to do so. And then as soon as I started feeling that way, he ripped the rug out from underneath me. He pulled away, started hiding things from me, neglected to tell me things that I felt I had a right to know, and grew increasingly distant. He basically stopped trying... and left me to feel like a damn fool... every now and then he drops what I call “bread crumbs” to keep me around and then he drops out again. It really hurts. 

I was really hoping he’d come around... but he’s been letting our relationship slip through the cracks and doesn’t reciprocate things that are vital for the survival of what we have. Today I cried so hard in the shower over it that I started hyperventilating. 

I showed up to work in a dumb ugly Christmas sweater, my hair in a messy braid and my eyes swollen from crying. There’s this guy that comes in like once a month, he travels a lot with his job but he’s been a regular at my bar for a long time. He made me feel pretty, I’m not sure how exactly. He was just overly interested in me today on a day where I just felt really ugly and sad. He tried to get me to stay after work and have a drink with him but I politely declined, left and took the train home. 

I guess it just helped me recognize that if things don’t work out with J, then maybe someone else out there will appreciate me and make me feel special. I’m trying not to let myself get so upset over J anymore. There’s only so much I can do. I’m not perfect. I get emotional. I feel things too deeply, and I guess maybe J was just overwhelmed by me. I’m not going to let it hurt me anymore. If I’m not what he wants, someone else will want me. It’s disappointing, yes. It’s painful, yes. But I’ll survive.",05Dec2019,1

I ended up getting Intermittent Leave through that employer so that I could use up to 8 days paid per month for medical issues at 70% of my normal pay. These days did not count toward my attendance.

The company closed our location in June of this year, so I had to look at other companies as I did not want to relocate. I went from working for an international company to one that's 20 people tops. They aren't regulated by FMLA (have to be there a year anyway, so wouldn't qualify for it anyway.) 

Since starting in June, I've used my sick time already and my medical issues are cutting into vacation time now. I don't know what to do at this point. My scoliosis is under control, but when my neuralgia flared I just have to take my prescriptions (which prohibit driving) and go back to sleep.

 It doesn't help that our HR manager hangs her breast cancer over everyone, saying things like ""if I can come to work, you can to.""

59,"Ok, so I thought I seen it all coming up in my teens and whatever. Now at 21, I realize the road ahead will be even more difficult, and the fact that I believe I’m mentally ill does not help this. 

When I was in 2nd grade, the school peoplez told me that I should probably be on meds, they noticed some bullshit about my behavior. Mom was like “Nah we got god and a belt :) “ lol that didn’t help me in the long run you bitch. Whoops sorry god please don’t send me to hell for typing that please...I’m human we all get upset hehee..anyway..

Blah blah fast forward in life and I totally should have been on meds early as a child. I know for a fucking fact I could’ve been a completely different person than who I am now. The shit that I’ve been through doesn’t help either. Everything is just painful memories, loneliness, self loathing/harm and constant backstabbing lol. I remember my ex told me something , “It’s not who you are, it’s who you’re becoming” and she’s right. I’m not this fucking freak. But it’s who I became now. Idk  I’m trailing off..

Obviously I’ve had suicidal thoughts, tried to kill myself plenty of times. Unsuccessful pussy shit I’ve pulled. I no longer want to kill my self, not first at least. I want to murder my stepfather, for being sexually abusive and trying to instill fear in my sister. I live at home now, again, and he’s still there. I want to murder him. I want to murder everyone who had a hand to play in why I’m how I am now. Then I get suicidal bc I don’t want to harm abyone. Not a single soul. I find myself twitching when I have certain thoughts that I cannot access physically or act on. I get mad and find a place to yell on the top of my lungs. Everyone I’ve ever known calls me crazy. Insane. I believe them now. Everything is wrong with me. I believe I am ugly and I believe I am stupid. I believe I am a nigger and I am worthless however I do not believe I am a “faggot” bc I love women or at least their ham wallets between their legs. I believe I’m a “bitch ass nigga” which is why I will murder those who said I am. I want to murder. I want to kill. As I’m typing this I’m getting mood shifts. When I typed , “I want to murder. I want to kill” I was gripping my phone tighter. Staring deeper into my phone, typing without really looking at the keyboard bc texting is second nature to me since I don’t really do shit else other than juvenile shit at 21 LOLZ. 

Oh yeah I’m a deadbeat son too! I didn’t ask you fuckers to bring me into this earth, lol. A lot of things are my fault in life, but I honestly had to go through certain things to fucking learn.  I don’t know SHIT about life! Nothing. I was never taught any fucking thing. I’m no man, just a boy which is fine because once I murder men I will prove that you do not need to be 6”1” , 200+ lbs to murder. To be a man. To take what cannot be given back; life.

62,"It's been a weird past couple of weeks for me, and to tell everyone the truth, I've not been taking it all too well. It's by no means the worst I've ever felt, but it is the most frustrated and confused I've ever been. 

For months now I've felt like I've only existed to go through the motions a person would go through in day to day life. I had lost all motivation to change. That feeling snuck up on me. 

I had a very loving relationship and that helped me cope a bit. We are no longer together but are still good friends.

My parents have been hounding me to move home for months now, but I'm so different from them politically that I have to pretend to be someone different or risk being exiled. My parents don't talk to an aunt because of the exact same reason. I love my parents, but I feel like I'm a stranger in their household.

To top it all off, I found out my roommates haven't been paying their portion of the bills and we owe 800+ to the electric company. I'm already on a tight budget as is and have been paying for our gas bill alone. I assumed they weren't asking for the electric because I practically lived with my girlfriend. Despite this, they went and bought a ton of Christmas decorations and lights for the house.

I guess the good news is I don't have to stay with them after this month. No one ever bothered to ask for a new lease, so we are living month to month. I can leave anytime, but I don't really feel like I have anywhere to go. The only place I've ever felt at home was with my ex. I think she may be one of the only people to accept me wholesale for who I am.

I feel like my life is unraveling, or like it's being ransacked or something. Chapter 2 of Slaughterhouse-Five starts with the line: ""Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck from time."" I feel like I've come unstuck from my life. Like I've been unmoored and set to drift. Like I really don't have a driving purpose and I don't know what to do. I'm not asking for advice or anything.

When it's busy and there are a lot of people, I get nervous.

As I am cleaning the dining area and customers are looking at me, it makes me uncomfortable. I worry that they can tell that I am nervous and judge me for it or that I look unapproachable.

I was at the laundromat recently doing some laundry, and as I was folding my clothes, a few people were just sitting down watching me fold my clothes. It made me uncomfortable.

And I got a couple of new numbers to text. About once a day I texted at least one person. A different person every day pretty much. One person I messaged about a week ago actually reciprocated and messaged me instead of me reaching back out to him. It went great. We had a great conversation. One of the best I've ever had. It made me feel like I've got this thing licked. This morning I saw he was online and I messaged him. It seemed to start off great but then it turned kind of dark. We began talking about our mutual abuse growing up. That is when it felt like the conversation took a turn. Anyways, we let one another go politely enough and we didn't argue or anything like that but it still feels as if it were a failed conversation. Like I did something wrong. My psychiatrist says that conversations arent a zero-sum game. I think he means that there are not winners and losers but I have a hard time seeing it that way.

Recently she came back to my city to visit this past summer because her family is still here. She asked me to go get coffee with her, and wanted to catch up. So I meet her, and she ended up confessing to me that she still has feelings for me and said if I was single in 2 years(when she finally moves back to this city again), to see if I wanted to give this whole thing another try. I still love and care for her so I said that is a possibility.

Fast forward to now. I met someone on a dating app about 3 months ago and I really like her and it feels like things might start getting serious. I still occasionally text my ex so I texted her a couple days ago to let her know about this new girl. She was super supportive and sweet but I could tell she was sad at the same time. So for the past couple of days, I’ve been struggling with guilt that I may have broken her heart, even though our break up was over 2 years ago and she’s the one that chose to move away(which she herself feels guilty about, which I wish she didn’t). It’s gotten so bad that I’ve went to bed in tears. I just hope she’s okay. We’ve decided no contact for a while so that things don’t get messy again. I just want her to be happy. She is one of the most wonderful and amazing people I’ve ever met, and she’ll always be my first true love, but I was just not strong enough to keep up a long distance relationship for this long.

I'm worried that he'll get re-elected and the ramifications of that. I can't understand how people can support him. It makes me sad that there are enough people that either don't care, or are ignorant, or actually support him.

I can't understand how 53% of republicans think he is a better president than Abraham Lincoln.

i wasn’t sure about what to do or where to go after highschool so i went to a prestigious law school because i had really good grades and wanted to basically show off. i want to quit now, because it doesn’t interest me and there’s just no morals in this area.
i mean the answer seems easy, just do something else you like. but the this is i don’t have a clue about what i want to do, nothing really interest me and i hate this feeling. i really don’t know what to do anymore, i thought about travelling to see if it “awakes” something inside me but... i don’t know. sorry for ranting like that :(",05Dec2019,1

I don’t really know why, I suppose because it’s pretty, id post them too if I ever got them developed but I’m worried I’d keep them forever on my roll of film. Why would I want evidence of this day? It’s been a horrible, beautiful day. Right now the sun has set and it’s getting darker. The candles are still burning. Grief is very weird—I feel like she’s still here, then suddenly I don’t.

94,"Ugh.

I'm a 24 y/o male, and I've been married to ym wife for 15 months. We've had a bit of a rocky time of it, with her studying for her teacher training, and me trying to get my freelance work off the ground while also working 2 other jobs, we were able to just about make ends meet. We had a tough time over the summer, trying to work out some stuff between us, and we were both making steps to improve (or so I thought).

She got her teaching job, which brought us nearly triple what I was making for us (after rent and bills), which was incredible. I was able to leave one of my day jobs to give me some time off. We talked about me leaving the other job, and we agreed that I'd be able to in the middle of December, so I got my notice ready.

2 weeks ago she tells me she's thinking of separation for a short time, to hopefully help us rekindle our relationship in our own space. The following day she tells me she's ready to move out and call this marriage a day. That weekend she went to view a flat, put a deposit down and had a moving date. a week later she moved out, and yesterday she text me to say she's sending divorce papers next week for me to sign.

I'm angry and I'm hurt because I don't understand what I did to warrant her leaving so suddenly. I'm now in the shit financially since my freelance work does not bring in enough money for me to live, and getting a long term job when everyone is looking for Christmas temps makes life so hard. I have to find somewhere new to live when our tenancy runs out in February, but can't afford to put down a deposit or pay any agency fees.

102,"I was perfectly ok with being alone ... I was doing alright for 8 years, I was 18 when my first and only girfriend (of 5 years, which back then felt way longer than years do now) died because cancer doesn't choose ages after all... I felt attracted to girls, I dated a few and had my share of one night stands sometimes ... out of necessity... but I never really tried anything ... I was ok, I had my music and instruments, my hobbies, my gym practices, I was happy.... I went to bed tired and slept, woke up not thinking of anything in particular ... Until you, you FUCKING DEVIL DRESSED AS A WOMAN, entered my life! Fuck you ! Fuck you!  


I was ok with my guild in World of Warcraft, I was ok in the discord server the guild had, I had ""friends"" there, I was kind of active there ... then you came... you didn't need to start pm'ing me ... but you did, on your own so I started to know you.  


Only ... you didn't care to mention you had a boyfriend, so my stupid-self began eating the lies you threw at me, the way you told me I was special and made you feel special ... it was not my fault that you started sending me your pictures and that your red hair and green eyes were suddenly all I could think about .... and your voice ... your sweet ""inoccent"" sounding voice that covers up the monster you really are... you failed to mention you had a boyfriend for months ... and when you did ... I still didn't tell you what I felt for you ... but you knew! FUCK, WE CHATTED ALL DAY EVERY DAY FOR MONTHS!  


You made plans to come to Spain with your friend (which ofc you skidded out off) and asked if I would go to Spain to see you for coffee and pastries ... I told you I'd crawl to Spain for pastries ... in reality I meant that I would crawl to see you.  


Then one more week passed, in fact it was, since we talked first, 3 months passed! ... were you kept telling me I was special and made you feel special... and me not saying a fucking word ... then you told me you had a crush on a friend ... I assumed it was not me (and really, it wasn't, I know now) but still took 1 week feeling like an idiot ... because I am not used to this things ... to confess to you that I really liked you, and I told you I was sorry that I dissapointed you, that you probably just think of me as a friend ... but I could still be your friend and didn't want the chats we had to end because of my confession .... You could have been honest and told me you wanted nothing with me! but you wanted something ... attention... nothing more, nothing less, so you told me I was the one you had the crush on! And I felt amazing, I trully felt like my stomach was going to come out of my mouth... You said we needed to take baby steps ... so we did ... I fell more and more for you every day... I wish I was lying ... but sadly, I am not.  


Then, you told me your boyfriend gave you the ring ... but you didn't accept the engagement (which was a big fucking lie) ... you said you didn't accept because of me, you didn't want to lose me (Big fucking lie again)... I believed you ... I thought carefully about what I was going to say because engagements and marriages are not a joke to me (but to you they are, I see), so when I figured that for you, Iwas completely sure I could, if needed, drop everything (here in Portugal) and go there (fucking Romania on the other side of Europe), and do it all, for you, because fuck, I did fall for you hard, again, my unexperienced fucking stupid self ate your lies like they were candy... I told you I was ok with waiting, that I'd accept any decision you made, and that I really really liked you .... You said you were amazed by the answer (trust me, I was amazed I could say that too but I was so completely sure of what I was saying and not fucking with your feelings, like you did to me)  


""Baby steps"" were kept ... because ofc, you didn't want anything with me other than attention, you fucking attention seeking whore!  


I was buying your fucking birthday present 2 months in advance .... I went to the trouble of sending it along with some chocolate and an hand written note full of my fucking ""Love"" ... and my Birthday, which is 2 weeks before yours, I told you I only wanted a photo of you ... and you couldn't even be bothered to send one photo on my bday ... It was something that bugged me for a while but still it took a lot of other shit you did to me for me to mention it, I still remember the bullshit excuse of ""not liking to send photos"" when you previously sent me photos of yourself, unasked ... but that of course, was just so I would give you my attention ... you didn't need to do that anymore, because you knew you were all I thought about.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I learned you lived with your boyfriend (ups, sorry, did I say boyfriend !? I meant fiancé ... sorry, I believed your lies for months I still don't know what's true and what's not)... which did wonders ! I went to bed thinking you were in bed with him, I woke up thinking he was the first thing you saw each day... how wonderful! I lived like that for months! silly fucking pittyful dumbass moronic me!  


The first time I dared to ask what the hell I was to you, you fucking snapped out on me (sorry, I got out of place, stopped being a good gullible idiot the first time) went super cold towards me for a month ... and I put up with it ... you didn't even answer what I was ... and you ignored my affection towards you ... me being an idiot ... kept calling you dear ... worrying about you ... and you came around and ended the coldness (in reality, you just started to call me ""dear"" again ... after one month without you calling me that ... you have no idea how that little 4 letter word impacted me... shame it was a lie in istelf too!)  


Then guess what, months before, a few days after you told me about the ring, you sent the photo with the ring in your finger to almost EVERY FUCKING PERSON IN THE GUILD, but me! (and probably didn't send it to other guys you are probably still doing the same you did to me too) and I believed your fucking excuse that it was just so people would stop asking when were you going to get married (oh ... right, and you hate sending photos, but it was ok to send this one to everyone, but not one of your face to me on my birthday ... great!)  


You told me you were checking houses to move in, alone, just you, but THEN YOU, (surprize surprize!) DECIDED TO MOVE IN WITH HIM AGAIN! TO A NEW HOUSE HE BOUGHT ... how wonderful!

So yeah, we had ups and downs ... I may have snapped a few times too but it was because I was suffering, I was there when you needed, when I needed you, you ignored me, I would talk about us, you would change the subject ...  


I sent you some christmas gifts ahead of time, even when things were not that good because you were ignoring the fuck out of me whenever I spoke about us ... but you still led me on and on and on.  


It got to the point where you did it so much in a row I pointed out that it was rude .. instead of explaining or apologizing ... no YOU FUCKING TOLD ME I WAS JUST A FRIEND FOR YOU AFTER ALL ... yes my world shattered again ... you said you were done with me .. and once again I believed you (but you were not done with me ... you weren't done shatteting my self esteem yet, you fucking bitch)

&amp;#x200B;

yes, I blocked you (wisest decision I made) ... yes, I finished work, got out earlier... went to the bar to get drunk feeling like an unwanted, unloveable piece of trash, and called the one girl I knew wouldn't reject me... yes we had sex! You know about it, because you actually called me over facebook (oh, did I forget to mention you and your boyfriend are ""engaged"" in facebook, according to you, so guys don't hit one you ? yeah... dumb me believed that too) the next day, and me, not knowing to lie, unlike you, told you about it ...

&amp;#x200B;

You wanted my attention back, I didn't want to lose you, so for a week... there I was ... but you were cold again, you accused me of being cold ... and that did it!   


Then you finally told me the truth... and I begged you to block me for good on facebook too ...  


So good luck making that baby you are planning on having with him!  


Good luck marrying him!  


Have fun living with him!  


Fuck you Adriana! I hate that I actually loved you...",05Dec2019,1

106,"From getting fired from my first job to now

After graduation, I managed to hired at a major finance firm which was super competitive to get into and made my whole family and myself proud. Unfortunately I wasn't in the best state and suffer depression 3 months into the job. As I was performing bad at my job, I decided to say fuck it and went traveling with a friend of a friend that i met at a house party backpacking in Europe for two weeks (out of my comfort zone) for my vacation. Even though it was a short time, it was a step into getting out there and realizing theres more to life than work. It made me believe in ""work to live"" not ""live to work"". I met so many people from this trip from hostels and parties. It was a trip I will always cherish.

Once I came back to my job, the depression came back. I was unfortunately let go after only 10 months due to a major fuck up (I think) or I just wasn't performing. I fell very deep into depression and hid in my room for two months. I lost all of my friends in my city and disappointed my parents. When I thought my life &amp; career was over I decided to hit the gym as a stepping point. One month into it I lost a lot of weight and gain some muscles and confidence back. I decided that taking all this free time I should better myself and gain all my confidence back. I made a list of challenges for myself to accomplish and thinking back on that memory of traveling, I decided to download a language learning app and learn the slavic language Polish since I was interested in the country and was curious to  know more about the culture. 

I got super into this app since I was feeling a little lonely and the app allows you to meet people who are also taking on the challenge of learning a language. I messaged one Polish girl who recently graduated from university in English studies and was using the app as a way to practice English. We shared a lot in common and realize we both were going through similar situation (confidence lost, parents disappointed...etc) but we kept motivating each other each day, she helped me with Polish and I started slowly becoming a better person. 

4 months past since I lost my job and even though i was still struggling to find a job, I was optimistic. One day, I was approach by a firm was expanding quickly and I was also approached by recruiter representing a major company. overly excited, i accepted an interview with this major company and that same day I was telling this girl about it. We continued the conversation on how it would be nice if we met but it was ""impossible"" due to distance and everything. She said if only. 

When I heard those two words ""if only"" my mind began a series of flashbacks of when I obtained that near impossible job from a pool of candidates, to losing weight and to all the accomplishments from stepping out of my comfort zone. I decided to follow my gut and bought a ticket. I told her we should meet and go somewhere to travel. I gave her a speech on how I travelled with someone I barely knew and ended up becoming amazing friends even though my slump. She agreed under the one expectation that I meet her father at the airport.

 I cancelled and rejected the interview and took the risk to meet her. I met her father and promised him that I would protect her. We spent 2 days in Krakow and by the second day feelings came together. She decided to extend her stay with me by traveling to Prague with me. Ww met up with a couple that I knew who happened to be in the same area as us. They met her and were shocked how we met and how I took a risk. We had an amazing time together and they proceeded onto the next country in their euro trip. Unfortunately, for me and this girl time was running out as my time in Europe was approaching an end. We said our good byes at the trains station thinking it was the last time. 

She was amazing though. How could someone change me 1000km away from me just leave like that. She felt the same way and after staying in touch she decided to buy a ticket to visit me in Canada. After two weeks with me, she took a big step by applying to the working holiday visa lottery to see if she would obtain a visa. I ended up accepting a job at the firm that was expanding quickly and at the same time the girl worked at her dads company. We decided to do long distance hoping that she gets her name selected. Chances were slim. 2000 apply....400 get selected. We were optimistic. After 9 months of waiting and visiting, her name got selected on the closing week of the lottery! We spent a summer with her family and now we've been living together for almost 6 months and she found a job as soon as she got here. I'm currently studying for the second test in my professional designation and been approached by numerous companies as I got back on track in my career. From one slump to now. There will always be light. Stay strong everyone and always step out of your comfort zone. Without taking a risk.... you'll never live life to the fullest",05Dec2019,1

A personal post

Hey guys...it’s me….u/Drblackcobra.You know that guy from the r/gaming subreddit talking about my room and playing death stranding and stuff.This post is after the review that I made for Death Stranding.I uh need to say some stuff about myself.I know this post will be weird and annoying to some and won’t even get noticed,it will be very long,but...here goes.I consider myself to be a personal...failure.Yeah, I know,we started out weird.When I was playing death stranding,I personally felt bad for myself because kojima made a game..and I can barely even go to my laptop and start practicing coding.I think I was born in a way where I would be designed to fail and I personally accept that fate.

I’ve been thinking about my home and school life now,I think everyone else is ahead of me.I do have a loving family,don’t get me wrong,but I feel like I’m a messup. I’m the one who’s constantly doing weird and annoying things god only knows why.I’ve been not doing so well in high school now while everyone else is getting medals for straight As and honor rolls.I think to myself:”Cobra,you are such an idiot and faliure”. I personally think that from everything my parents have done,from giving gifts to the children of my 3rd grade teacher,to giving food constantly to my other elementary school teachers,was because of me...I should be the smart kid!Idk why I’m not mentally and physically smart.

My body is a literal toothpick.I’m tall,annoying,and skinny as heck. Don’t even know why I’m in the JROTC or even want to be a marine. I’m pure funny material,probably why everyone makes so much fun of me.Why can’t I ever make friends? It’s so dumb,I see everyone at their group tables chilling and having fun,me? I don’t know if I sit at a table with friends but Idk if they’re even my friends. I guess since middle school I’ve put this personality to others that I’m not worthy material to be a friend. Don’t even know why I didn’t sit with anyone at lunch. Why am I an indian anyway? Wish I went back to India,even though I was born in America. There I might have a chance to make new friends there.

I need to apologize to some people,well people and subreddits. Here goes..u/99Disfuntional,I’m sorry for making you throw up or something or being annoyed by me. I hope that you have a good life with you and your friends. I’m sorry for being so...irritating about my art goals and how they’re not improving.I’m sorry for not having the same interests as you,which is why I’m on my crusade of finding friends with similar interests.I’m sorry for r/needafriend,r/makenewfriendshere for posting the same thing over and over and over and over again. Same thing goes for r/programmingbuddies and r/artbuddt. Same apologies to those guys.

I’m wanting to become a game developer,art,programmer,animator...but I feel like they're all pipe dreams.I’m a loser who can’t even make his own top notch game. I’ve never gained any progress on my goals and I can’t even make myself be like one of the greats. I’ve tried to practice and even tried to do courses but I managed to not even improve the slightest or even do anything about it. I mostly saw everyone’s art at my local comic con and it’s so much better than mine.I’m considering giving up.

My carreer doesn’t seem to be a good choice.How am I helping soociety,I should become a doctor like my sister and Idk what to do.I feel like I should probably just switch carreers because I’m not truly helping people or saving lives by making stupid video games.I’m an idiot for even trying to do that path.Heck,even with the militaary,I’m a 14 year old skinny dude who can barely do exercise how am I going to become a marine?I’m literally a toothpick bro.What’s the point of joining,how am I ever going to get stroong and end the teasing?

11/18/19:Currently seeing everyone else having a good time in support monday,if you have an A in a core class(science,math,reading,history) you get to have free time or study.I’m seeing everyone else at the library having fun and stuff.Now it’s time for me to go. (8:55 AM)

11/18/19(9:03 AM):Ok let’s move on.I have more things to u/’s really frustrating to see people whose personalities are not weird and annoying and more chill and cool.I don’t understand why I couldn’t make friends in the first placu/because of the curse of my habit of making friends,or is it something else?Unfortunately,I might never find out.I don’t know how long I can keep up this.There might be a point where the fuel runs out,its game over.

I can’t even make game developer,aritst,or animator friends.Most of them aren’t good enough for me,they feel like I’m a weird person and just go,showing my idiotic personality.Heck,even after I finish this post,no one will even CARE to be friends with me.I think my time has come in this world,its time to make it as best as possible.

Idk what else to say….High school’s probably going to be 10x worse without anything to do,I’m hopefully trying to atleast do some work. My grades are eh,I’ve never gotten a true As because I’m an idiot and never put in the work. Atleast,my dad said that I’ll never get the feeling of all As because I’ve never achieved them.Heck,I’m not a smart kid at all.Everyone else is ahead of me and here I am makig As and Bs and I might even not do so well on my SAT and ACT.I’m also a absolute dumb person who can’t eveen do simple tasks.I’ve been remembering how my dad used to scold me for getting instructions wrong and that’s my fault because I’m an idiot.Moreover,thanks to my dumb mind I almost failed 3rd grade and my dad and mom had to beg the principal for letitng me stay in.If I was smart,I’d been ahead,learning more,but I’m an idiot.(9:40 AM,11/18/19).

(10:00,11/18/19):Again,I’m an idiotic dude who could’ve been smarter if I was bron hte right way istead of torturing my parents by making them give gifts to the teachers and their children,all because of me.

111,"Been crying since I got the email saying I didn’t get the job. I just graduated from a fairly good university last spring with a good GPA, moved to a new city to start my life, and I’ve been nonstop applying for jobs. I’ll admit, I still don’t know what exactly I want to do, but I’ve been applying to roles that most closely fit my prior work history and education. I apply on multiple job sites, reach out to recruiters/HR departments directly, and send many follow-up emails. I’ve interviewed for a couple jobs, and every time I think I do well. After I send my thank you emails, my interviewers usually also say something along the lines of “we really liked you and are looking forward to seeing you again.” I get my hopes up. But another few days go by, and I always get that generic email from HR saying that they’ve moved forward with other candidates instead of me. They say they can’t give individual feedback, so I don’t know what’s going wrong... I’m so sad because I really thought I’d finally get a job this time after all these months of looking and applying... I felt so happy when I got the 2nd interview (3 total) and thought I did well.

What I have seen:

Emergency alert button commercials that have dramatizations of the elderly falling down stairs , crying out in the darkness, recently fallen and cute little Susie bouncing in and finding grandma crying/moaning in pain on the floor.

The  Sarah McLachlan-type ads showcasing animals (cats, dogs) in squalid horrible conditions. Shivering in the cold, in need of medical care, etc. etc.. There are several different companies that show these commercials

Military veteran charities showing disabled veterans. There are several companies who show these commercials

St Jude charity ads showcasing bald  cancer-ridden children.

A charity ad begging for money to save these old jewish women in Russia. They showcase the horrible conditions in which they live. 

Too many Law-firm commercials advocating lawsuits from car wrecks to classaction lawsuits for medical conditions because of medications that caused said conditions.

Scare-mongering life insurance company ads that prey on the elderly worrying about leaving their loved ones with nothing or funeral expenses when they die. 

Health insurance ads targeting (scaremongering) the elderly.

120,"Man I’m just so fed up of having this be such a fucking noose around my neck. I think there’s something wrong with me when it comes to relationships. Like more than with normal people. I’m 21, a virgin, small and skinny as fuck (although not completely ugly) and so hopeless, awkward and so aggressively far away from going anywhere with a girl that my friends have started ‘joking’ that maybe I’m gay (although a couple of times they’ve genuinely went ‘we’re fine with it if you are’, as if they genuinely think I am). It’s not really that which gets me down, i obviously have nothing against gay people, it’s more the fact that people cannot wrap their head around the fact that I’m straight, like it’s becoming crazy to them at this point. There’s no way it even seems possible, it’s just not a thing that can possibly happen.

To most girls I think I’m not even a sexual being in their eyes: people love being around me, I have a solid amount of girl friends who tell me ‘there’s nothing wrong with you’, but I dunno. Like I can just tell that’s not the vibe I give off if that makes sense. I watch other people flirt, I watch the way people look at each other, talk about each other, the whole entire dating game really, and it’s just something that doesn’t happen for me. People don’t do it to be mean, it’s like I’m a complete sexual non-entity. One of my friends recently broke up with his girlfriend (he didn’t even like her and cheated on her for reference) and is getting so much support for feeling down when he says shit like ‘I’m gonna be alone forever’, but I’ve been completely full on single for 21 years and nobody has ever given me that much sympathy, encouragement, or advice; just jokes and the occasional ‘it’ll happen’. People just don’t take me seriously when it comes to any of this.

I think it goes deeper than that though. Because recently in the last year or so things have turned around a little and girls do now and then come on to me, and it’s on these very rare occasions someone is attracted to me it makes me realise just how fucked up i am. I completely freeze up. I don’t know how to describe it, it’s more than your usual nerves. I’ve matched with a couple of girls on tinder before who have wanted to hook up, and I’ve found some excuse not to go through with it each time because it terrifies me. I’ve had girls try escalate things with me before and (with the exception of like 2 times where I’ve been blackout drunk and obviously just went along with it cause I’m not thinking) I completely defuse any sexual tension by not flirting back on purpose, even if I like them, and I honestly don’t get why. Part of it feels just creepy and wrong to me for some reason. I don’t know how to describe it, I just get the feeling it’s something I shouldn’t be doing, that people will think I’m a fucking weirdo for even trying to flirt, even if they’ve shown interest, and if I get it wrong every person I know’s gonna find it hilarious and think I’m a creep or something. It’s like a subconscious thing. I think I’ve spent so many years being an ugly duckling and  seeing anyone being attracted to me as some impossible fantasy that when it actually seems real, it completely fucking psyches me out.

A big reason my friends have been piling on me more recently for this is a girl on tinder literally asked me on a date, suggested we get a hotel room after, etc., and I backed out. I couldn’t even really explain why to them, cause it doesn’t even make sense to me, and it’s only added fuel to the fire. Ive tried to justify to myself; maybe I just want to wait for someone I genuinely love, maybe hook ups just aren’t ‘me’, etc. But the excuses feel kind of hollow. I think deep down it’s just a severe lack of confidence. It just feels to me for some reason like someone liking me can’t happen for me; there’s got to be some kind of catch, or somehow it’s gonna end with the joke being on me in the end. Completely irrational, I know, but my confidence has clearly just been completely fucking ruined over the years and I’m not sure how it got to this stage.

And the thing is, I don’t have a clue how to fix it. Yes, I could work on myself until I learn to flirt back with someone and sleep with them or whatever else, but it’s such a big deal in my brain now that the whole thing just terrifies me, and even if I did, I’m still gonna be held back by everyone I know’s pre-conceived notion that I’m just that little dude who doesn’t ever get laid. And the thing is, I’ve tried to fight against it. I’ve went to the gym, actually approached girls on nights out a couple of times to varying degrees of success (hell one girl just came out of nowhere one night and gave me her number, I’m clearly not a completely lost cause lmfao), tried to get out of my head, but none of it seems to change any of this. It’s like part of my personality now, in a weird fucking way. That’s just how people see me. Like I actually get nervous about how people will react if I change from that. I’m not sure how I build up that confidence within myself to be that guy who can just go for it when the whole world kinda reinforces into me everyday in little ways that I’m not that guy, and never have been. I feel like this has become an issue for me to the point where it’s not healthy, and I’m just completely fed up of it. I used to love the idea of being with someone, I’d fall hard for girls, and I couldn’t wait for someone to feel the same. Now I barely ever have major feelings for anyone whatsoever, and honestly am so burnt out that part of me just wants to stay single to avoid all this hassle, and I’ve got no idea how to turn any of this around.",05Dec2019,1
121,"I don't like school. Very often I am happy, and I express myself honestly and can make myself social and communicate. I've had a history of not being very social and just hating myself every day but now I've learnt to like myself, gotten a girlfriend even, and become way more positive. 

The problem is even with that positivity it seems like people don't generally like me very much. For example there was this guy in 1st and 2nd grade of high school (I'm in my 3rd and last year) I talked to, he tended to ignore me for his friends in higher classes and always ignored what I said when looking at his phone with a rude ""mhm"" even if I asked a question (if you're gonna be busy with your phone, at least say ""hol up imma answer stuff""), now that guy (who's in my class) is social with other people and if I try to add anything he looks at me slightly and ignores me. People tend to always do that, ignore me for their better friends, and I guess that might be my fault for being unable to communicate properly or something. Another thing is that people tend to just not want to hang out, granted I never ask but they never text me even with my contact info. 

My siblings, who are in the age range of 27 to later thirties, (I'm 18), don't seem to wanna bother with me anymore. I get it, they're old, but when one of them suddenly stops talking to you after having talked to you extensively almost every week for years you kind of feel like something is wrong. Especially when you don't have anyone to be social with other than your girlfriend. I'm happy to have a girlfriend I can be social with extensively, but I don't wanna feel like I rely on ONLY her for being social. She has friends, and even texts her grandparents.

So I have to ask if there is something wrong with ME for not having anyone to be social with, or is it just because I go to a  school without any people that want to hang out with me? Nobody seems compatible, and I AM picky with friends-but only picky in the sense that I don't wanna be ignored as soon as someone better shows up. 

It makes me feel like I'm the anti-social one, like I don't wanna be social and have returned to my past self- incapable of socializing, when I clearly do. I don't wanna push people to be social with me, I've actually tried that idea once when I was younger and truly lonely. Forcing people to hang out with you never works. I almost wish humans didn't need other humans to survive, but they do. We're social animals, so I couldn't isolate myself even if I wanted to. I keep trying and trying and trying but nobody seems interested in me, it's frustrating.

It's also because of this that the thought of going to school tomorrow makes me anxious, I don't wanna go to school because nobody seems to like me there. If there was anyone there that actually wanted me to be there I would, but I just can't.

126,"To my fellow... not great grade peoples. This is my story and hopefully it's a bit of an encouragement for you.

I was always the class clown in school. Talked too much. Made too many jokes. Didnt study much. In grade 11 I tried and managed thee B's and 3 A's for my subjects, but by grade 12 I was over school and stopped studying and started failing assessment. Ended up with 3 B's and 3 C's overall. 

Teachers all told me how I couldn't get into university and how I was letting people down.

I did well in the intelligence test that you have to take for your school grades to be ranked against other schools. Got an A in that. (Teachers encouraged me to opt out because they thought I would fail and bring the school's rank down). 

Teachers hated me. In metal work class I got a B for a box I made. My friend screwed his up so I gave him mine to hand in for himself  i just dinted and scratched it up so it looked different. The teacher gave him a B+... after it got damaged...

At the end of high school I ended up with a rubbish overall rank for university entrance.

Did labouring jobs and worked for the railway for a few years. At 21years old I applied for university. I got into a bachelor of arts because you didnt need a very good rank to get into that. I got some okay marks in my first year which enabled me to transfer to a bachelor of psychological science in my second year. To get into that course straight from high school is extremely difficult and requires very high marks.

Pretty average marks through my 2nd and 3rd year, which was pretty impressive considering how much weed I was smoking. I didn't get high enough marks to qualify for 4th year honors. However my university had a pass stream 4th year. Which was looked down upon ""you will not be consisered for post graduate study if all you do is the pass stream"" people said.

I did the pass stream. Ended up with a gpa of 5.53 (with 7 being the highest). Very average mark. But enough to get me the equivalent of honors 2a. I could have gotten higher but I worked a fair bit during university, I prioritised work experience over grades.

I then got a job as a counsellor. And did that for 8 years. My degree no longer makes me eligible to apply for post grad study after 10 years. So I thought before I hit that point of no return I should at least try applying for masters so that I can get my psychologist registration.

I applied to 3 universities. The minimum marks to apply were 5.5. I had 5.53... I was going up against people with 7's. There were 400 people that applied to each masters program. And each program accepts only 12 people.

I ended up being offered masters in psychology at two universities. Beating hundreds of people with higher grades than me.

So now Im 2 months away from starting my masters in psychology at a university that is ranked in the top 50 in the world.

There are so many people that say grades are everything. But I've found time and time again that when there is a will there is a way. That persistence is more important than top marks. That who you are as a person and your personal skills and experience counts more in life.

Tldr: screw all the elitists and their ""my grades are better than your grades"" bs. You just be you and keep at it and you can still achieve great things.",05Dec2019,1
