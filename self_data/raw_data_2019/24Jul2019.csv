0,"I’m a formerly anxious person. Broke “out of my shell” when I was 20 and forced myself to take a waitressing job. 
I’m  24 now and have had a few jobs since then. Right now though, I’ve been at my current job the longest. 2 years this week. It’s a cashier/stocking job at a grocery store. Pays well, I’ll be getting a raise in a week or two, and the social aspect of it wasn’t a huge problem anymore, up until about a month ago.
I’m finding that I’m apprehensive and desperately hoping nobody looks at me, nobody stops me for a question, nobody gets upset with me over something I can’t control, like an out of stock or some moldy produce, nobody is too chatty in my checklane.  The slightest amount of disrespect from a customer is almost too much to bear, my heart starts pounding and i begin to see black spots across my vision and I feel like crying. And that just ends up in bad service when I hurry them through the lane to get them the hell away from me.
And then yesterday was the worst experience I had there. An entire rude family came through my lane, two parents, a teenage son and some uncle maybe? Uncle came through first and he pissed me off for getting shitty over the fact that you have to buy bags in my store. Not my problem or my fault. We are busy, pick up the TWO items you carried through the store without a bag, or buy a bag, but do it quickly. I said none of this to him. I handed him his change and receipt from the two items and he shoved them in his pocket, then he changed his mind, pulled them back out and tossed the penny on the floor in front of me. I got out of my register, picked it up and told him he dropped something. “I DONT WANT IT.” “Then in the future, you hand it back to me. Do not throw it on the floor.” He left but came back before the rest of his family was done.
The parents had a few different transactions with no dividers between any of them, so it was hard to tell what went with what. My blood was boiling from that encounter. I don’t normally do that. I don’t know what prompted me to do it to begin with. I had to run down an aisle and check an item code for something without a price tag. She kept telling me what it cost, but I can’t just type a price in. The thing was $10 and I needed the exact item for inventory purposes. I came back and she was irritated that I couldn’t just take her word for it. 
And then the son asks me “do you have any kids?” Weird. Invasive. I ignored him, hoping the I’d finish the transaction and they’d be on their way before it got awkward. “Excuse me, do you have any kids?” I looked at his parents and his mother nodded at me like I should answer him. “No.”  “Do you want any?”  I looked at his parents again, that spotty-vision-heart-pounding thing starting up again. I continued to ring. They had no shopping cart either so I was just picking up items from the belt, scanning them and then dropping them back where they had set them because the old woman before them had taken my shopping cart outside. “Excuse me. Excuse me you didn’t answer me. Do you want any? Do you want any kids?” My line was long, my coworker also had a long line and my manager was nowhere to be seen. I don’t know why I didn’t call him up. Kicking myself for that now. I looked at the teenager’s mother again and she mumbled something I couldn’t hear and shrugged a little. His father was talking to the uncle. No indication that they wanted their son to stop. 
I looked at the kid realizing I’d need to answer for him to go away. Shrugged. “Don’t know.”
“Maybe I can help with that.”  ........................... “Did you hear me? I said maybe I can help with that.”   I looked at his parents again “REALLY? Alright your total is ______” “Did you hear me” “YUP, I heard you!”  
Dad gave me cash, I put it through, he grabbed a paper bag, I charged him for it and used his change to pay for it.  
They begin to walk away and I start my next transaction. I hear my coworker in front of me say sweetly “no, I have a husband.” Lie.  “Who cares about him? I’m not worried about him. Have you seen Family Guy?”  “Yeah.” “Well I can be your Quagmire. Giggity giggity!”  I don’t remember any conversation at our checklane after that, until I went and told my boss.

Today, I felt nauseous going into work. And I dreaded every time a customer came near me. And I don’t want to feel like that at work.  Can I be regressing back to my formerly anxious self?  
I’m so frustrated.",24Jul2019,2
1,"A quick reaction would be to say that I have some form of ADD/ADHD. I can't be put into these categories though because even though I do fidget from time time I'm not constantly wanting to move around, I am very well organized, I have an easy time completing tasks and paying attention in class, and I don't misplace things often.

Instead, I am constantly thinking about several things at once. I like to imagine it as my mind being a tube and the thing I'm trying to pay attention to is a beam of light going down the tube. My ""mind tube"" has holes in it though where the light escapes and that represents separate thoughts stealing attention, or in other words stealing light that's supposed to go down the tube. My mind has many holes down it's tube. 

When I'm talking with someone my main attention is on the conversation, but the holes in my ""mind tube"" are spilling some of the attention light to think about the past, present and future all at the same time. This leaves the attention light dim once it finally reaches its destination and I'm stuck there looking like I'm not paying attention. 

Please tell me if that makes sense and please let me know if there's anyone who can relate. This goes with everything in my life. Even writing this post I'm thinking about dozens of different things while still trying to get my point across. I hate seeming like I'm uninterested in what other people have to say just because I can't focus. 

Meditation is obviously going to be the number one suggestion and I'm actively partaking in that practice. I just need to know if anyone can relate though, if anyone else's mind is constantly thinking about dozens of things at once.",24Jul2019,2

4,"Hi.
My name is Ben.
I’m going to preface now, this post is going to be a bit of a novel. So you totally are in the right to scroll off if you don’t have the patience to read it, or just don’t give a shit.
You really shouldn’t be expected to have either, you don’t even know me.
I’ve never posted on reddit before, or even used it really. So I apologize if my post “breaches” any of the unspoken posting etiquette y’all might have.
I only really know of reddit from youtube videos.

To be entirely honest, I don’t know why I’m writing this post. At least, not super-specifically.
Just generally.
I just know I told myself that I’d try everything I possibly could at least once in an effort to save myself before doing anything rash. 
Yes, I’ll get back to what I mean by that, but I’m sure anyone with a lick of sense knows what I mean by that.

As of right now in my life, I’ve been alive 18 years. 
I really can’t speak for anyone else other than myself, but I certainly feel as though my life hasn’t been the most normal. Whatever that means. Or at the very least, not so straightforward.
I’m not going to take you through my life event by event, because I want to be as sparingly self-indulgent as I can here. I’m far from a narcissist.
But I’ll give you a decent window in.

Diagnosed or undiagnosed, I’ve struggled with mental illness my entire life.
ADHD was a persistent problem for me in all of my formative years and beyond, all the way up until now. And I hadn’t gotten it diagnosed, or medicated, until about the latter, latter half of 2018. So you can imagine the impact that had.
Anxiety is a genetic thing for me. I have both a panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder and they’ve troubled me as far back as my memory can really reach.
The same goes for clinical depression, which has become more and more prominent the more years that pile on.
In addition to those I also deal with rather severe OCD. Which cripples me to the point where I can barely leave my bedroom some days. It really depends honestly.
I also most likely have some form of PTSD and some form of a derealizative/depersonalization disorder. No formal diagnosis yet.

I really don’t think I need to explain, or jerk off any further why, or how that clusterfuck listed above affects me every day. Anyone past the age of 10 can understand that one. So I’ll leave it at: it’s shitty.

I dropped out of school in 8th grade due to what I now understand was ADHD impairing my school related skills. Didn’t know that then though.
Not too long after (however I don’t really remember for sure, I have hardly any sense of time), my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, that would end up killing him within two years time post-diagnosis
Its been two years since he passed.

After dropping out of school, I spent the last 3 1/2- 4 years off grid completely.
I holed myself up in either my room, or my sunroom, and spoke to no one, give or take the small extremely necessary interactions. 
At first it was depression, but the isolation changed to being used to cope with my dad’s diagnosis after it happened.

During my time in isolation, I filled my time by reverting back to all I really knew how to do;
and that was entertain myself.
Movies, games, music, the works. I got myself familiar with each of the fields, because at the time, it was what I had; and was, and still is, something I hold great passion for.

After dad died,
Not a lot changed on my behavior front.
About what you’d expect really.
My mental health continued rapidly deteriorating, I sank more into my comfort zone, my familial ties fractured completely, even with my immediate family, and ultimately, I felt like a zombie.

A failed, 2 year, mutually abusive relationship, a neglectful parent, some dead pets, some time in juvenile detention, some voluntary stays in a mental hospital out of state in a last ditch effort to get better; it all blends together now.
The past 2-3 years could’ve happened all within a month for all I fucking know and it wouldn’t feel much different.
The suicidal thoughts don’t fucking care.

For those still reading,
Yes. Thats what I was alluding to earlier.

Suicidal ideation has always been the worst of the struggles for me.
It certainly doesnt help that after a parent dies, death is on your mind rather constantly. At some point or another, you’re bound to put you and it together, at least mentally.

30+ failed attempts under my belt.
All self sabotaged.
I don’t want to die.
I could list the reasons why all day, but the point is, I don’t want to.
I’ve tried everything, and am trying everything I can to not let myself get to that point.
Residential therapy,
Pets,
Friends,
Relationships,
Creative writing,
Art,
Therapy,
Meds,
Etc.
Etc.


Fast forward to now, and here I am,
I have a new, healthy relationship, about a month sometime soon.
I’m writing a book,
I have 3 pets,
I have a small handful of friends,
And I just-
Don’t care.

Every day for the past 1/2 to full year, I’ve been feeling further, and further detached from reality, 
And I just
Don’t care.
That’s really all I know how to say.
Hardly anything has a value to it for me, at all, if it even has any to begin with.
I just feel
Hollow.
Hollow, and disconnected.
Completely despondent from anything around me.

And I don’t know how to have hope anymore.
Not really, anyways.

And I just don’t know what to do anymore.
Because part of me wants to die.
And it’s really loud.

I’ve been shut down and withdrawn for the past week or so now.
I’m active,
But I don’t feel present.
Everything feels clouded 
Like a thin fabric I could pull away at any time.

I told myself I’d post something like this if things ever got this bad.
See what came of it.
I dont really know what else I have left to try. 
I don’t know what I’m even expecting out of this post.
I’m just trying.

I don’t want to die.",24Jul2019,3

7,"Dear Mr Mueller - 

After reading the redacted version of your report, one could reasonably conclude that you attempted to lay out information that would allow Congress to exercise their oversight responsibility to check the executive branch, and potentially employ the constitutional remedy for a criminal president, namely impeachment.

Since your report's release, the current administration has done everything possible to block congressional oversight by instructing subjects of subpoenas to ignore them and by making misleading or ambiguous characterizations of your report.  We cannot know if the Trump administration has directed the Justice Department to  stop other investigations or referrals you may have made. We cannot know if they have preserved the underlying material supporting your report.  There are many things we cannot know because of unchecked executive power via the Justice Department.

I believe you to be a man with deep respect for the laws of this country, and we all owe you a debt of gratitude for your lifetime of service to this country and it's values of honesty, fairness, integrity, and equality before the law.

Tomorrow you will undoubtedly be presented with questions that you can answer without exposition.  I also believe that the distinction between what you believe and what you can prove is an important pillar of fair jurisprudence, but here we are presented with something unusual - the possibility that you could prove a crime or crimes, but are unable to charge those responsible due to Justice Department policy.  If there are facts or context that are important to understanding underlying uncharged crimes, I urge you to give congress the tools to fulfill their constitutional duty.",24Jul2019,1
8,Kind of a dark r/showerthoughts but it occurred to me today after some reflection that those thoughts were making my mind heavy. I guess sometimes it’s good to say it “out loud” to nobody in particular to get it out of your mind,24Jul2019,4
9,"The most rare and somewhat awkward thing happened today, but it needs a short back story for context. 

I’m a guy and currently on Tinder, legitimately looking for friends and if it happens, a connection and relationship with a woman.  I ended up matching with some one, I’ll call her Jill. We chatted for a few days in-app, and then I said it’d be neat if he got together in the near future. She said sure and gave me her phone number. 

After we started sending regular text messages, at one point she added a new photo to her Tinder profile. It was of herself, her son, and her daughter. All three standing together posing for some one else taking the picture.  I made a comment on it, and remarked that it made her look short.  She confirmed that she indeed was very short. I also made a comment about our proximity — Tinder gives a general distance how far away some one is. 

Meanwhile, I’m also on Grinder. I open it maybe once a week. I have far less interaction with guys on there than with women on Tinder. But I’m also much more flirtatious and direct on Grindr - because I also have a sex drive and I want to get laid sometimes, too.  I rarely meet any one. Maybe one every two months. So any way I messaged a younger guy, and sent him a face photo, because my profile photo has it cut off intentionally. He never responded. 

Cutting back to Jill:   Last night she and I got together. We hung out on the patio at a bar down the street.  I had half a beer while she had ice water. It was a nice two hour talk, before long it was late and time to go home.  Well when I got home, after talking with a good looking woman for 2 hours, I was horny.  So I got on Grindr and messaged that same young guy again. I said only, “Hi.”  In the next morning, he responded asking for a pic. I sent him a faceless shirtless photo. And I noticed he had posted a new picture to his profile, too. This one was him and a girl sitting on the floor in front of him taking a mirror selfie.  He looked familiar. 

I switched back to Tinder. Lo and behold.. he was Jill’s son. Guaranteed.  He even posted his instagram name, which was his first and last name.  A total match.  By this time, I noticed that Jill had unmatched me on Tinder.  And Grindr guy replied to me saying, “You look like a (my real name).”  Ha!   I said, “Yep. Small world.  It’s kind of odd that you have a picture of your underage sister on Grindr.”   He replies, “It’s kind of odd that you took out my mom and then messaged her son.”  I couldn’t help but laugh.  Then I replied, “I hadn’t connected the dots until a little while ago. But, a fuck’s a fuck, eh?”   He blocked me on Grindr. 

Ha!  I had ended up flirting with a mom and her son in the same week.  They both disappeared in the same 24 hours.  

… sigh.  Oh well.  She sure dodged a bullet huh?  :)",24Jul2019,1
10,"I’m constantly in my own head. I think way to much, I live in a area that mainly Hispanic and I’m white and all the girls down here either don’t like white guys, or maybe I’m just ugly or I don’t even know but the girls in my area are either whores or they think their to good for and sub average to average looking guys and it makes it impossible to try and connect with any of them. I liked this girl in my class and I was the one mainly talking to her but she went for my friend rather than me (who was Hispanic) or maybe it was me but I feel like whatever I try it doesn’t work. The only good thing I have going on right now is the gym, I consider texting some girls that I think are cool but then I get into my own head and think about what good can come from it and I daydream about it and then by the end of the day or night I realize it wouldn’t work for whatever reason. I just don’t know what to do at this point and am looking for some advice",24Jul2019,1
11,"I honestly truly wish I could just not ever like anyone again. I hate it, the whole thing. For context, I’m 21, a virgin, and apart from a couple of drunken make-outs that I can barely remember, nobody’s really shown much interest in me. I’m overly self-aware, so I’ve exhausted every angle of why this is and thought about it a lot. I’ve seen a college counsellor a few times to talk over my (relatively mild in all honesty) depression and anxiety, which has made me see things even more clearly. And the bare, honest truth is that my personality just doesn’t let people see me as a viable dating option. I’m my own worst enemy. But I am who I am, and I wouldn’t know how to make myself someone who’s attractive to others.

Now, I’m not some neckbeard-slinging, fedora-wearing, incel subscribing social pariah. Through my teenage years I was pretty bad looking, but the last few years I’ve grown into someone who’s probably hovering around average looking. I’m pretty funny, I’m awkward as fuck but I own it in a way people tend to find endearing, and everyone tends to come around to liking me. This is part of the issue though; I’m a massive people pleaser. I can’t bare the thought of anyone disliking me. Every little action I ever take, I worry about how I’ll be perceived. It alls stems from having so little self-confidence and self-worth that I need the validation from other people, but when it comes to dating I think people subconsciously sense that a mile off and nothing is a bigger turn off than somebody who’s desperate on the inside for you to make them feel whole.

My whole personality is based off this inherent flaw. I use self-deprecating humour because it helps me make light of it all. I’m overly nice to everyone because I don’t want them to dislike me. Every little bit of flirting, every little interaction with someone I like, gets examined to high fucking heaven in my brain, desperately trying to make sure I haven’t offended, haven’t ruined any chance I have. I’ve been like this for so long, this human fucking doormat who hates himself so much that he’d rather let people trample on him than get off the fucking floor, that I can’t change it, because now it’s my whole personality, it’s how everyone I know already perceives me. It’s hard to change your perception of yourself when the whole world reinforces that toxic view of who you are on a day to day basis.

For instance, perfect example; I was walking arm in arm after to a club with a girl I have a thing for right now. Her idea was to ‘make the bouncers think we’re a couple so we have a better chance of getting in’. I’m thinking to myself that night and the few days after ‘holy shit, that had to be flirty’. I got my hopes up. A few days later a friend of mine tells me that he saw this, and said to her friends and mine that we make a good couple. All her friends were instantly like ‘fuck off, you shouldn’t say something like that’, as if the very fucking idea of dating me is some horrible, absurd punchline. My friend found this story fucking hilarious when he told me it. Because ultimately people see me as some lovable loser, but on the other side of that coin, I’m basically an unlovable joke. 

I know I could maybe turn this around by just believing in myself somehow, and changing how I view myself. I know inherent confidence in yourself is attractive, knowing who you are and being proud of it, but I just can’t do it. I don’t know how. I wish I could like myself, but I don’t know what to do. And I’ve tried man. I’ve been to therapy, I know the thought process that leads me down this road, but it doesn’t mean it stops just because I’m aware of it. It’s exactly like the voice in the ‘Stupid Piece of Shit’ episode of Bojack Horseman, if anyone knows what I’m talking about. My counsellor has told me before that I’m a good person and that I don’t deserve to hate myself so much. And I could even tell she felt so shitty for me. But the cold, hard truth is that I don’t have that self-worth. Every little thing I do wrong adds to a massive pile of ‘proof’ in my head as to why I’m inherently unlovable, and it just gets me down even more.

Nobody in my life knows the insecurity goes THIS far, but I think people can kind of sense this about a person without you having to spell it out. Girls feel sorry for me, like they would a beaten up puppy, but they’re not going to date someone who dislikes themselves like that. And I don’t blame them, I’d be a mess in a relationship. But all of these flaws don’t stop me being trapped in a cycle for falling for people who show the slightest bit of interest in me, thinking this will be the one to change me, and being let down when I realise they don’t see me like that, or waiting too long to ask them out, or just being frozen into inaction because of all this doubt I have about myself. Even right now I still have a thing for that girl I was walking arm in arm with a few weeks back, I like her a lot, but fuck if I’m gonna do a damn thing when I know she just sees me as a friend, and her friends and mine see the idea of us dating as some hilarious joke. It might be a joke to them, but to me it just ensures any self-confidence that might dare to spring up inside me gets beaten right back down. I fucking hate it, and I wish I could just switch off feeing anything towards her, and whoever else it’s gonna be in the weeks, months and years to come.",24Jul2019,2
12,"There was a guy [21M] I [19F] have been seeing for about 2 months now pretty consistently. We both are staying in our college town over the summer to work, but we met on tinder early in the summer.

Things started out pretty well. We went on a date, went on another, hooked up, spent time together just hanging out, and slowly getting to know each other. At a month in, I brought up being exclusive and he agreed. We both said no title to the relationship yet, but I felt more comfortable being exclusive since we met on Tinder.

The next month it was better. We got along well and had great times together and I started to really like him. I was hesitant still since I knew that nothing was confirmed but I thought we were heading in a good direction.

Soon I’m going back home for a few weeks before the semester starts and I knew I wanted to figure out what this was leading to before I got invested. I had him over and we talked. He said he was indecisive, but from his responses and reasoning, I knew it was a no to a relationship. He didn’t want anything serious or a major commitment at the moment. It hurt, but I held in tears and explained that I know what I’m looking for and I can’t just be waiting for an answer. I want a relationship where both people are in it wholeheartedly.

It was a very honest conversation. We both said our thoughts and though it hurt, I can’t explain how nice it is to deal with this in a mature manor. My past relationships were all drama and pain and ghosting. I don’t know if that makes it hurt more, but I now know exactly what i deserve in the future. Funnily enough, right after we started talking about our families and opened up in a way we haven’t before. He left and we both decided on friends.

I still hope that maybe he will change his mind and say that he thought about it and wants to pursue something, but I know he has to make the first move. I’m not getting my hopes up. I felt ready to be in a relationship, it’s so comfortable, I’m not looking forward to the trial and errors again. For now, I’ll take a short break and let myself enjoy things for a bit.",24Jul2019,4
13,"Before I start, I should probably give some background about myself, so here I go. For as long as I can remember, I've been a really shy person, I never had many friends, and my family never cared about me. I've been dealing with depression and every occurance that accompanies social awkwardness for as long as I can remember.
 
Not long ago, I was in a relationship with a girl, it was great, too good to be true. She was a pretty girl and was friends with just about anyone she met. For years I had her on Instagram and I never talked to her because I was too nervous, then one day, she sent me a message. Now, even though I'm a nervous wreck in these situations, I didn't have anything to lose so I complimented her and we ended up hitting it off.

Not long after that, we were dating, it was the happiest time of my life, but it didn't last more than a few months, as 3 months in, it started to fall apart and it dragged on for about 4 more months. Why did it start to fall apart? Right about the 3 month mark in our relationship, certain events led me to think that she could be cheating, mostly revolving around how many lies I caught her in and the fact that I would be gone on a trip for a few weeks and she would text me asking about where she could buy a plan b. Since I try to find out as much information as I can before I jump to a conclusion, I would ask her why and she would always say, just in case I need it. So yeah, I was beginning to get worried, she came off as suspicious to me.

With my suspicions and anxiety building by the day, one night I decided to do something, so I waited until the right opportunity (I'm sorry if it upsets anyone about what I did, I really was distraught and I didn't know what to do). I was staying the night at her house one night, and she had fallen asleep, so I decided to prove or disprove my suspicions, so I went through her phone (which doesn't have a password). What I found broke me, it deepened my depression exponentially in an instant, I just wanted my life to be over. I couldn't stand it any longer, by this time, it had already been 7 months since we had been dating and at that moment, I knew it was our last.

For weeks after, she kept trying to get back together, but I wouldn't, one day, she snapped, she started getting her friends to harass me online, I easily dealt with them, but then she, herself starts trying to harass me, that one hurt a lot more, but I still handled it easily. I thought it was finally over, until she lied to my parents about everything and convinced them to believe her, they believed her over me and ended up basically disowning me. She decided she wasn't done there, she wasn't going to be done until she took everything from me, so she decided to lie to all of my friends too. I lost all of my friends but two, and my depression is more prevailant now than ever.

I honestly don't know what to do, my life has gotten better, but I still feel the effects of it today. My parents finally believe me after they caught her lies and they seem to finally care about me more, I've made a few more friends, but I'm still looked at in a negative light by everyone that knows me, they all believe and side with her, most of my old friends and aquantances now hate me.

I would like to thank anyone who actually took the time to read this, I'm just really depressed and I don't know what to do, I guess I just needed to vent or seek advice.",24Jul2019,51

15,"When I finished high school with good grades, I didn't know what I wanted to do in life.

I've always been a very anxious person, so when I saw my friends immediately signing up for university, I thought that I must do the same. I never considered that it would perfectly okay to take a year off, go on some adventures, work an easy job, and spend some time thinking what I wanted. I never spoke to anyone about the fact that I was uncertain, but I really should have.

I enrolled in a computer science degree at a top university, not because I had any interest in the field but because I heard there were good career prospects.

That was 8 years ago and to this day I cannot stop thinking about how that decision has put my life on a trajectory of constant misery.

I hated the degree, I wasn't interested in it and I struggled a lot, failing many subjects. I was very depressed. I dropped down to a part-time workload to try and make it manageable, but I was stilling failing subjects. After six years of struggling and not graduating, I dropped out because I suspected that I was going to fail every subject the following semester and the uni would probably kick me out.

At this point it still never really occurred to me that maybe there was something else in life I would find enjoyable and in which could flourish. Instead I began working full time in a menial, mind-numbingly dull data entry job. I remained very depressed as my life became a cycle of dull work, coming home at the end of the day too exhausted to spend any time on other hobbies.

And so, realising my life was going nowhere but unsure what else to do, I made the extremely smart decision to enroll in ANOTHER computer science degree, my logic being ""Well, it should be easier this time because I'll already have seen some of the coursework!"". So here I am now, 26 years old, almost 10 years since I've finished high school, halfway through an undergraduate degree that I hate, with no life experience of value or memories of good times, depressed and approaching suicidal.

I feel I've realised my errors too late now. I hate my life but I'm terrified of trying to change it. I don't think I can bring myself to drop out of university a second time. I have no idea or plan of what I would do if I did drop out. I don't want to go back to some dead-end job, and I have no other marketable skills. I've neglected keeping up my hobbies after years of being depressed.

At the same time, I hate the idea of finishing my current computer science degree. It's going to be a huge struggle to finish it, and if I graduate I'll just want to get as far away from the field as I can. It feels like a waste of money and time.

I think more and more about suicide. I regret my past, I can't stand my day-to-day life, and an enjoyable future seems unattainable.

To any students reading this, when the times comes to make a choice about your future studies, please don't make the mistake I did. Do not waste your time doing things you hate or find boring. Our youth is precious, especially given the impending environmental, economic and social disasters that we will likely see in the decades to come. If you have an interest or passion, pursue it. If you don't, go on adventure and explore the world, while you have the fleeting freedom of our early 20s.

If you need money, pick up an easy job even if it doesn't pay much. Leave yourself time and energy to try out as many new things as possible. Do not go and push yourself to do something difficult and mentally taxing, if you're not interested in it. You will be miserable.

Of course, we all need to earn some money, but it is a waste of life to sacrifice your happiness for the sake of it.",24Jul2019,7

It just looks ugly, being that Im in one of the most beautiful places in my country, one hour spent picking up litter made me feel a bit better.

Her hair was so beautiful that it inspired me to paint using the colors of her hair. The painting hung and she would come in every few weeks, the one time I had the courage and she was with a guy so I didn’t want to be disrespectful if it was her SO. Then this evening she came in and I took three deep breaths and started talking to her. Prior to that between her and I it was just eye contact and non stop laughing, she would have me so melted I would sweat and shake, that has never happened before and I’m 36. So today I said “that painting is actually inspired by your hair color, I thought It was beautiful. I didn’t say anything last time because I didn’t want to be disrespectful if that was your bf.” She smiled and was excited and said she wanted to take a photo but due to location I told her I’d email a straight on picture which I did a few minutes ago. I am grateful that I actually talked to her and got her contact info but on reflection I’m more happy that even if nothing comes of it I made someone’s evening and put a smile on someone’s face. There was so much odd laughter and nervousness between us that I’m glad I finally broke the laughing. I rarely talk to those of the opposite sex in my business but the energy with her was too much and if I inspired someone I would want to know so it seemed okay to do.",24Jul2019,5

I finally did it. I was able to meditate for 10 minutes straight last night. The best part of it is that all the random thoughts are almost gone. The first time i tried meditation, I kept thinking of completely random shit while I persistently try to focus on my breathing. And if the session felt long, I would start thinking of how long it has been since I started. I haven't felt the full effects of meditation partly because I just started a few days ago and also, there's a couple more habits degrading my mental clarity that I'm still working to get rid of.

(30ish) First of all I don't date. I don't play games if I say something I mean it. I am too trusting and I suppose pretty naive. But I'm used to being messed around and it usually doesn't bother me.

This time though I just can't let it go. I am a fucking wreck. My head is spinning. I feel physically sick. I have never really felt like this before (also I feel like a pathetic little baby).

A little over a year ago I met a person online. It wasn't a dating site. A friendship developed organically. It was great. Then heaps of sappy love letters. It was even better. Video call. Photos etc. We both wanted the same things and an intention was established that we would work out a way to be together. Then communication stopped. I sent a couple of messages then sent one ,sort of, ""goodbye, wish you all the best and will always love"" you type message. Left it. Moved on.

Months later get a message. Apologies. They explain the situation. We start over pretty much from where we left off. Then messaging stops. I do the same as I did last time. And just get on with my life, no worries.

Current situation. A few weeks ago get a message. They explain things. They have a complicated life and I get that. This time they say they have realised that they always want me in their life. they give me their phone number. I find their new skype account and make a request. I think okay this time is it. But then... they stop messaging me. The thing is this time I can see that they are still very much active on their account. They even posted on a dating advice site asking for advice on dating.

Obviously I still love them. There is just something about this person that feels right. I have been sending sooooo many messages. Crazy messages. Professing my love. trying to be funny. straight up asking why. I haven't been abusive in any way.

But nothing at all...

Why would you say all that stuff to someone and just leave them in the lurch. I meant every word I said to them. I've applied for a passport and I'm thinking about just going there. i mean do people throw around words like love. What kind of person would I be If I just gave up? Just another fake person with no integrity. Like I said I don't play games. Social etiquette etc I have no time for. I think honesty is more important than anything else. I was showing them how I feel. What's so bad about that? Why can't they just tell me how they feel?

fuck I don't know. Tell me im crazy. I know I sound crazy. I know Im acting crazy. But I can't stop. I've never even met them like what the fuck is wrong with me?! Im so fucking wound up and it makes no sense to me. hey won't talk to me and explain so maybe someone here can tell me something to help me understand. 

There are so many other things i need to be focusing on right now. I have a life and I've worked hard over the past year or so to dig myself out and get to the point im at. I don't even know if these feelings are attributable to this ""relationship"" . I feel like im beginning to spiral. Maybe subconsciously i'm using this as an excuse to fuck my shit up again.

42,"I’m 19(M) and I can’t help but feel like my life is already fucked. Out of high school I took a worthless course that was a waste of time, failed a course that would get me to university if I stuck it through and then sat around with a part-time job my mom pushed me to get to get me out of the house more. I’ve been working there for close to a year now and I’m just so sick of it.

I know I work barely 20 hours. I know I can Try education again this coming school year but at this point I’m just setting up dominoes to knock them down myself.

I’ve lost contact with all of my friends barring one who’s just as fucking lonely as me and I don’t even know how to talk to people anymore.

I wake up and genuinely wonder why I’m even getting out of bed anymore. To earn a wage? What for? I’m not independent enough to even think about a car let alone moving out and even then, all I’d be doing is isolating myself further.

Any sort of hobby I had before just seems...empty now. My free time consists of me aimlessly looking for things to take my interest, spending money on it only to drop it a week later.

I’ve resolved to kill myself twice and of course backed out of it because I can’t even stand in a road for half a minute.

Love seems like a far-flung fantasy at this point. I feel like a broken piece of shit holding himself together with strings and like hell I’d just throw that on the table and ask someone to fix me.

I’ve talked to my parents, tried that whole ‘Better communication’ thing but it just seems futile. They can get me motivated for about a day before I relapse into whatever you’d call my current state. 

The teachers at the next course I’m signing up for are already recommending I seek mental help on the second meeting, two months before a highly intensive course starts. It’s not like I deserve that place anyways.

Everyone my age I know is either already at university or about to go. I feel like I’m being left behind.

45,"Everyone faces failure at some point in their life, I've been dealing with failure for four years now and counting. This began my freshman year of high school, I walked in the first day with a bad attitude about school and that set the mood for the rest of high school. I've never been a super strong student. I always did what I had to do to get by in school, but I never went the extra mile. At the end of freshman year, my family went through a really rough divorce. Once school started back up I had become depressed and lost all motivation to do my school work. The only reason I would show up to school was to see my friends because they made things a little bit better. I began to not care about my grades, my teachers would talk to me and try to motivate me. I was stuck though and no one could motivate me. At the end of sophomore year, I had failed over a quarter of my required classes that year.

Junior year was the worst, it began with my brother dropping out of high school and getting his GED. This idea of getting a GED sounded magical to me. You get to take a test on each subject and if you pass you get your GED. Well, the thing is, I didn't realize that a High School diploma can help you way more than a GED. Junior year I decided to give up and get my GED, I began ditching classes at an alarming rate because I knew that I would drop out eventually. By the end of junior year, I had failed over half my classes.

Finally senior year, this was the year that would make or break my High School diploma. The year begins with my school counselor, parents, and vice-principal having a conversation with me. I was told that I had two choices, I could either do two years of work in one year or drop out of high school. This was it, this is where I finally found my motivation. I no longer was forced to do this stupid thing called school, it was now my choice if I wanted to graduate or not. I realized that it did not matter whether or not a teacher or my parents tried to motivate, me if I wasn’t willing to put in the time and effort needed to get it done. And so began the long and mentally draining process of attempting to do two years of schoolwork in one year. I almost did it too! Unfortunately, it was too much pressure and I failed two more classes that year. That brings me to the summer of 2019, I am now currently trying to complete my last two required classes to graduate high school. It definitely hasn't been easy and I am still working on keeping myself motivated. I have learned more about myself then I could ever imagine through this journey. I am happy that I can finally say I see an end to this battle I've been fighting for four years, and I am excited to move on with my life.",24Jul2019,5

51,"This is partly my own inward analysis of the situation so I can understand myself better and partly me desiring advice and perspective from a third party.

I've had two friends for about six years now. I'll call them friend A and friend B. Both of them have been by my side during the time I became very depressed nearly two years ago. Mostly by listening to me and trying to distract me from problems. And in friend A's case, giving good advice (friend B's advice is pretty bad due to lack of life experience, I think). This was mutual because I did listen to their problems as well and had no problem giving them advice back or trying to make them feel better. During this time, I had major problems with them that would not start to affect me until later...I was usually the butt of their jokes and they often disregarded me like brushing aside my opinions or experiences. It really, really started to bother me once I started to climb out of my depression. I wanted them to stop. I directly confronted B about this and made B understand I was tired of A and B being mean to me. For A, I just stopped laughing at A's jokes related to me or acknowledging them with anything more than a disapproving look. Both seemingly got the picture and it lessened. 

Now, both A &amp; B have openly revealed to me that they don't care about other people or their feelings. Every time I offer a sympathetic outlook to a situation, they brush me off and say I shouldn't care about other people. I didn't think of it much when I was depressed (tbf didn't think much at all during this time) or in HS (when we first met). But now that I have gotten out of my depression I realize that something I really value is showing empathy, perspective, and compassion to others. Now, these interactions with both my friends really began to bother me and irritate me, especially when I started to get brushed off for having my own perspective. 

A has a problem with making their issues seem more important and bigger than other people's problems. This isn't a big deal right now but it is slightly annoying me. They have a crisis almost every weekend over the same thing and get drunk and text me about how they feel suicidal. I did not mind this before and tried to help A out, but lately it has been occurring so much and A does not take my advice or attempt to improve A's situation to the point where I have started to suspect this is being done mostly for attention and naturally also for comfort. There was a time when A did not respond me during a very bad episode until later and I couldn't help but feel they were worrying me on purpose to get a reaction. I understand from being depressed sometimes you just need the comfort and the feeling of being cared for but the weekly suicidal issue has started to become almost a shtick because of the frequency and as of late, I've become tired of reacting to it and don't really know what to do when A messages me about this issue or brings it up in conversation anymore. 

B did stop being mean to me when I openly showed my distaste to their actions. But then B started to act mean in a different way. B would sometimes insult me in a low-key way. I always tried to support B and make B feel better about themselves because I am aware of B's low self-esteem. B is also aware of MY low self-esteem but does not ever seem to care and does not attempt to promote my self-esteem anymore after I have more openly promoted B's. Recently, B insinuated I was ugly and admitted B did it on purpose, knowing how much it would hurt me, because we had a disagreement (which we often have, a lot of the time B disagrees just to disagree with me). I got so angry about this that I stopped answering B's calls. B calls me nearly every day (only when B goes to work, because I feel that is when it is convenient for B to have a conversation buddy during the ride, otherwise reaching B on a weekend is impossible) and I ignored B for a few days until I felt guilty enough to respond. B asked if B had made me angry but it was asked in such a disingenuous and playful way that even if B was genuinely concerned, it grated me enough to just say no. I felt like I shouldn't even try to explain myself to B because I felt I was truly seeing B for what B really is, just like B said, someone who doesn't give a shit about other people. I felt B's sympathy and kind words from before were fake and just a front for me and in reality, this is B's true personality. I ignored this aspect for awhile, suspecting it when B's sometimes ""dark"" humor went too far and was really insensitive and inappropriate to a couple situations of mine. 

Apart from this, B ONLY calls me. There is NEVER a real attempt to meet up in person despite us living a street away from each other. B only talks to me when driving to work every single day to fulfill B's social need because B has no other friends in real life. The last time we met in person was so that I could help B with a medical issue...B has openly regarded that B wants to take me out and go places with me and that B should, but it's always empty promises. I have been feeling like I do not benefit from this friendship in any way and a part from the three or four times I have picked up B's call out of guilt, I have barely picked up B's call every day for the past few weeks. I feel terrible doing this. It's my way of phasing out of B's life because I really just feel no desire to talk to B anymore.

I also do not find A or B's jokes to be very funny anymore. I did in HS and when I was depressed, but nowadays I feel like it's lost it's humor and comes across as childish to me. A has been bugging me the most in this sense. I recently became irritated because the joking and teasing went too far and I could only handle so much for 3 hours. It just came off as annoying to me (the goal ofc was to irritate me in the end). It got to the point where I got so angry I accidentally spilled water by pushing A away and A was then trying to make it up to me, in not the best way. I felt really bad about this, and I truly think A does put effort into our friendship in comparison to B. A passes by my house often to go places with me or to just hang out. However, I can't help but feel I'm just A's second choice whenever A can't go out with A's other friend...or when A needs emotional support because A's other friend won't give it to A. A needs constant validation and socialization. A doesn't seem like the type of person who can handle being alone. I feel like A takes advantage of the fact that I am friendless and always at home, so A always picks me up unannounced, assuming I have nothing else to do, so that A can fill A's need to not be alone. I'm not so sure how to feel about this aspect of A. I am no longer sure if A likes to hang out with me because of me, or because anyone would do and A just doesn't want to be alone. A has told me before that I'm boring and A wishes A had fun friends.

I also feel like I can't trust A and that A could easily turn on me. I have stopped opening up to A about certain issues, which A has noticed (because A wants to be aware of every aspect of my life and if I don't make A aware, I am a bad friend. A does not respect my privacy). I stopped basically because of how much crap A talks to me about A's other friend. It made me wonder how much A may talk or gossip about me. 

A and I do not have much else in common other than our background and loneliness. I do not feel like I can relate so much to A anymore and get easily tired from both A's high energy and A's constant jokes and teasing. I feel like we may only be friends out of habit at this point and I do not think I will be able to detach myself from the friendship unless A decides to do so. Apart from not wanting to leave A feeling alone, I fear A would share secrets of mine (if A has not already) if we were to part.

52,"It is currently 4:30 am and I have a problem of waking up in the middle of the night and have trouble falling back asleep. And recently I’ve noticed that if I lay down (preferably on my front or in a position that puts slight pressure on a limb), I can feel something crawl up my arm/leg/chest.
Now when I first noticed it, I thought it was a bug or maybe just some sweat. I live right next to some woods, so it’s common for bugs to get in (even as the youngest in my family, I’m used to getting them with a napkin).
But I only realized it could be my blood going through my veins that was causing the feeling of something crawling TONIGHT.
I don’t know if I’m just crazy, or it’s 4 am hallucinations, but that’s the best answer I have for the feeling of something crawling under my skin at random moments in the night.

&amp;#x200B;

New post, throw away, I've posted before but I'm on a new account and I don't have an old account active, idk how to phrase that part... I just got home from the bar where the second part of this took place, please excuse any typos. I don't know if anyone will read this, I really don't care if anyone does, but I need to say it and talk about it. I have to get this out.

A couple of years ago, I was going through one of the worst years of my life. A large part of my support system either died or left me within a short period of time. Everything else in my life seemed to be falling apart around me. The only remaining parts of my support system that I really trusted were at least a 10+ hour drive away. A couple months after everything started falling apart, I met a new girl, someone I am still dating (things are weird right now, but I guess we are still together). We have both had different traumas and different relationship dynamics through our lives, each our own, and we have each handled them differently.

Early on in our relationship, she was asking me about my previous relationships, specifically about people I was still in contact with. Some of which I was upfront about, and others, for various stupid reasons, I did not fully disclose the extent or nature of my relationships with regardless of whether or not we ever actually dated or hooked up. This ended up biting me in the ass one night after I was arrested on trumped up charges when I was mistaken for somebody else. As I was being taken into custody, I told her to take my phone, which was laying on the ground, and use it to get any numbers she needed to use. She knew my password, but until this point, I had never let her handle or use my phone without my supervision before. It soon became apparent to her as to why this was...

While I was I was spending the night in jail, in an overcrowded cell with my ""bed mat"" on the floor, trying to figure out how I would save my career, she was making calls to various contacts on my phone trying to figure out what to do next. During this time, she started looking through my photos and messages and found multiple instances of me misleading her and lying to her about my relationships with different women whom I had specifically told her that nothing had ever happened between me and them. After she bailed me out of jail, she confronted me about all of the things I had been hiding and had been lying about. I want to make clear that I never physically cheated on her, even the things she found were from months or years prior to meeting her, but I did lie about the nature and extent of some of the relationships I had with people who I still had in my life, and I had saved the evidence of this on my phone for my own.... use or satisfaction. One of these people happened to be my best friend who was a girl a couple of years older than me.

After this happened, we had many hard conversations about how and what we would do next. She was going to leave, I couldn't bare another loss of someone I loved (I did and I still do love her) in such a short period of time, and we talked about what steps we would take to fix the situation. Aside from me leaving the job I was currently working, cutting ties with various people that I was still in contact with include some good friends, one of the big ultimatums was that either I stop being friends with my best friend and that it was either going to be my girlfriend, or my best friend. I broke a promise I had made with my best friend years prior, and I chose my girlfriend over her. I already hadn't been in contact with her for a couple weeks at that point, but afterwards, I became a ghost. Among other things, I stopped replying to all messages from anyone in my old friend group, I quit my job and found a new one, I deleted all my social media accounts, I still haven't gone back to any of those things to this day. I basically lost all my friends, and outside of my girlfriend, I had nobody.

I don't feel like I can fully articulate or explain the situation, or its impact on me or anyone else it may have affected, but every single day, I miss my friends and especially my old best friend. Who according to the girl I have been dating, was never my best friend because lines were crossed that transcend the friend-to-more boundary. While this is true, that I had a marriage pact with my best friend, that we had talked about hooking up or being together at another time, nothing outside of messages and a couple pictures ever happened. Im not excusing this, but I just want to be clear. She was my best friend. For YEARS. She got me through so much and was there for me through more than I could ever expect from anyone, and I was the same for her. She was my best friend. And that is not a term I use lightly, I don't have many friends, I never have had a lot of people that I truly consider my friends. But I fucked up. I own this.

I lost my best friend that night. She texted me and left me messages multiple times afterwards. I never replied. I always felt sick to my stomach whenever I saw her name or her number pop up on my phone, because I knew she wanted her best friend too and that no matter what was happening, I wasn't going to be able to acknowledge her or reply, I had to either be upfront about her messaging me to my girlfriend, or I had to delete it. It was the same way for many different former friends, but it always hurt the most regarding her.

I still don't have many friends, I still get anxious about meeting new people or making new friends, I don't want to go out or do much of anything outside of work, there are only a couple people I ever talk to or hangout with on the rare occasion I have a day off from one of my 2 jobs and don't have appointments or chores or plans with the girl I am dating. I usually work and go home and spend my time at home alone watching tv, working out, drinking, and sleeping. It has been that way for over 2 years.

Tonight I went to a local bar down the street from where I live. Nobody knows I went there, not that there are many people to even tell. But while I was sitting there finishing my last beer of the night. I struck up a conversation with the lady sitting next to me. Turns out, she get her undergrad at the same school as my former best friend, during the same timeframe, and that they knew each other. I wasn't exactly sure what to do. I ended up asking the bartender for a pen and a piece of register paper, and I wrote a letter to her. It wasn't very long. But it was basically me asking her to please forgive me, that I missed her everyday, that I had received her messages but I wasn't able to reply, and no matter what she will always be in my mind and heart and that I hope she is doing well. I signed the letter and I asked this girl at the bar to send it to my old best friend, I basically begged her. I have no idea if she will ever get my note, I have no idea if she will ever care. I have always hated the fact that I wasn't able to properly end things and that I abandoned so many people who cared about me and who I cared about, especially her. Maybe she will never get this note I wrote for her tonight, maybe she won't care or will be too mad to read it, but I hope she does read it and can maybe understand that I wish I could still be there for her and that I will always care for her and wish for her happiness.

I am an idiot, Ive made many mistakes, I am not the same person I once was, I've paid prices for things I have done and for things I haven't done. Im not asking for a redo or trying to play victim. I just miss my best friend. It breaks my heart that I abandoned her and so many other people. I miss them all. Please forgive me. I miss you all, I love you all, I'm ok and I'm still here, I hope we get to meet again.",24Jul2019,1

65,"We’re both in the hospital, me for he last two weeks and she for the last week. Me, I almost died and got rhabdomyolysis then gained 60lbs of water weight and had leg swelling so bad you could leave indentations on me and I couldn’t bend my legs. Now I’m fighting pneumonia. 

My grandmom has heart failure, heart stopped for three minutes and they had to do chest compressions on her, breaking some of her ribs. She has a pacemaker now. I’m so glad this happened while she was at physical therapy, they were monitoring her so they responded right away. Still. She’s 85 and my only living grandparent. 

Her daughter, my mom, chickened out of a visit we paid for (flight and hotel) recently and I got so pissed and drunk one night on the phone my dad picked up and told me to never call them again. I’ve since sort of repaired the relationship by chatting and texting on messenger with my mom (HI MOM I’m in the hospital and almost died just bought you should know)but my dad will only day things to me through her and I’m working up to calling for the first time since. 

My dad had stage 4 kidney disease (“and worse things but he doesn’t want me to talk about that” thanks mom) and apparently had an hour to get to the hospital if he gets sick. But I don’t know, I feel like the people who have actually been hospitalized and nearly died (BOTH of us!!) right now should get some recognition.

I’ve had a very rough history with my mother, I hate slash love her and it’s complicated. She’s like a child. And I’m the parent. And right now she just wants to eat xanax, stay with my dad, and pretend everything is fine. She initially told me she was having panic attacks and that’s why she couldn’t make the trip (told me like 4 hours before the flight) WELL I’ve had to deal with my massive needle and blood phobia because I’ve had like 5 IVs (10 attempts), and bloodraws everyday for two weeks and just today two blood transfusions because my hemoglobin hit 7.0.

- if my best friend died, I would be sad for 1 hour but not for 2 hours. Death does not make me sad or puzzled
- There are people I extremely like and love and I would do anything for them for nothing in return and there are people that I hate so much that I want a bus to run over them all the time. No middle grounds, I either hate or love extremely. Also most of my friends are people I hate most but I do not show it. I still hang out with them and help them even though I want them to die
- I am not a violent man, I would not hurt anyone but wish them to be hurt by some other forces also I am not suicidial
- I can be very egoist one day and very humble or feel very inferior the very next day. Again no middle grounds
- I crave for respect and when I am not shown respect, I get depressed and shit all the time. I want to be listened to and my advice to be asked for. When my gf does not give a fuck about it, I will always start a conflict
- I cannot really emphasize people, maybe for an hour I manage to do so but then it wears off.
- I want something so bad at the same time do not want it at all
- I am perfectionist and suffers from OCD a bit but this is not the case

It's funny, because I've always heard about keeping hope, and even just having a ounce of it, and I always thought (and will probably think tomorrow) that it just isn't something I'm good at.

78,"We (Bill and Bob Clark) are not relying on ""nonexistent"" physical evidence for us to conclude sea serpents (a type of dragon) exist. We are relying on the physical evidence of having a definitive sighting of a sea serpent ***FROM ONLY 20 YARDS AWAY*** after it crashed on rocks at a beach allowing Bill to consider touching the animal while it was struggling. We saw the entire animal except for the tail. We called up the Coast Guard telling them there are dragons swimming in the bay, and they took us seriously as a Coast Guard helicopter was seen 20 minutes later. 

Laugh all you want but it won't change the fact that we actually saw a sea serpent swimming in SF Bay.

Before you whine and call us ''trolls'' we have a website set up where you can view our photos and our video footage - http://home.access4less.net/~sfseaserpent/

And no, while the oarfish is an amazing animal, that is not what we saw. We also think the Book of Job describes these animals to perfection.

Here's an example of a photo we took where a baby sea serpent popped its neck and head out of the water in front of our car when it was parked near the bay - http://home.access4less.net/~sfseaserpent/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/babyheadadjusted.jpg

Another sighting on February 19th On February 19th we had another sighting of one of the animals in the Bay. We were parked at the Marina Green location and spotted something black breaking the surface out in the middle of the Bay off the Western tip of Alcatraz so we decided to move to the Stone Tower Point location hoping we could get a better view of whatever it was.

Bob thought he saw something to his right about 100 yards off shore so he started scanning the area with his binoculars. While he was looking at one spot, all of a sudden, the head, a portion of the upper body behind the head and an arch of another portion of the animal broke the surface exactly where he was looking.

Bob got an excellent view of the profile of the head of the animal and was able to see a squared snout, an eye and a large jowl before the head went underwater. The arch of the animal was at least 5 feet in length and the head and upper portion of the animal was about 5 to 7 feet in length. It was about 5 feet between where the upper portion of the animal entered the water and where the arch came out of the water. The animal submerged before Bill could get any video of it.

A few seconds later, Bob noticed several portions of the animal breaking the surface about 50 yards further out in the Bay. Bill was able to see the head of the animal and a large arch directly behind the head for a second or two and was trying to take some video of it but a motorboat going West to East came right into the area so the animal submerged before Bill could get any video.

About 30 seconds later we both noticed the animal break the surface again about 500 yards further West from where we last saw it. Bill was able to get a few seconds of video showing a small portion of an arch breaking the surface.

When we watched the video at slow speed, besides the arch, we could see a few small portions of the animal break the surface after the arch submerged and then a long black image can be seen just below the surface of the water where the arch submerged.

***The animal looked like this*** - https://imgur.com/a/aCqXcSH

We have been posting ***DAILY*** about our definitive sightings and video/photo evidence since 2005 on various forums and social media, and not a single skeptic has been able to debunk our evidence. We have had our photos and videos analysed by ***Clifford Paiva*** who confirmed we have had a definitive sighting of an animal thought to be mythological. Paiva's twitter is located here - https://twitter.com/cliffordpaiva?lang=en

We attempted to show our photos and video as proof that Japanese dragons/sea serpents are real and spectacular to a biologist at a California university. He was so intimidated by our evidence that he threatened to call the police and we got kicked out of the university and told not to come back.

***I also posted other evidence of dragons such as this thread I made on Tigerdroppings*** - https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/o-t-lounge/chinese-residents-stunned-by-skeletal-remains-of-18-meter-long-dragon/73194310/

87,"For the purpose of this post, teleportation is impossible (reasons I won't get into- lots of math). 

&amp;#x200B;

Lets say someone wanted to achieve teleportation but can't without causing ramifications on spacetime. He decides to make a machine where you enter a pod (Point A) and select another at your desired destination (Point B). When activated, the pod scans your entire atomic structure. It then annihilates you in Point A pod and in that instant, perfectly reconstructs you in Point B pod by using ""dormant"" energy not used in quark-&gt;proton/neutron forming. This would balance everything out, atoms (and even quarks) are completely broken down back into energy while the exact amount of energy in Point B pod forms the atoms in the same formation.  In reconstruction it makes you exactly how you were when you entered Point A pod, even down to the memories (replicates synapses and chemical impulses (memories)).

So, the question is, would you still be you? If original you is completely brought out of existence, would you be dead. But the exact same you exists, so you're not exactly out of existence. Say there is an afterlife. Say Point A you died upon annihilation. When ""new"" you dies, there will be 2 of you in heaven (or hell or purgatory. I don't want to get too in depth). 

Another scenario is if in Point A you is completely broken down. Then, your particles are shot through a tube to Point B pod and is then reconstructed. The same question still applies- would you still be you?

This probably works better from a 3rd person story telling POV.",24Jul2019,1

Of former, of course, is over-bearing and just way too much (I *really* feel my emotions and feelings, im a sensitive guy) and the latter I take way too seriously sometimes and end up leaving her high and dry.

89,"Personal thoughts: Day 3 Part 2

For the past year, I have developed this habit of snoozing my alarm up to 3 times everyday until I have to hurry up for school. I wasn't like this before because my mom was the one who used to wake me up, and i never went back to sleep because you wouldn't wanna mess with my mom. But now, I live near my university and since I'm in college, I've been sleeping less and studying more, hence, the grogginess in the morning and the urge to snooze the alarm. I tried practicing not hitting the snooze, but the habit has gone too far deep. I am now the snooze man. What do you think is the best way to deal with this?",24Jul2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

ive spent so long chasing this meaning when its been there, my friends are that connection ive been needing and ive treated them badly. so moving forward i will give them the attention they deserve and be totally devoted to them instead of someone who is entirely undeserving and will only hurt me. i dont need to be in a relationship to be happy and i really dot want to be in one.

107,"To start off, sometimes I struggle with panic attacks and social skills. In the beginning of the fall semester, my college roommate and I got along and talked some, but as the semester went on, she was really quiet (We lived in a dorm). I would sometimes try to be friendly by offering her things like cookies. She would say, ""No, I'm good."" One time, at around 10:30 at night we had just our desk/overhead lights on. I said, ""Hey, come here."" She was like, ""...why?"" I said, ""come here."" \*She comes over\*. Me: ""Do you want a cookie?"" She frowns and says ""no"" and then walks away. Maybe 10 minutes later she goes to bed.....There was another time I offered her cough drops. She was like, ""Oh, I'm okay. I just have lots of phlegm sometimes."" I responded, ""You know, they have medicine for that.."" She doesn't say anything. I just stopped making any more attempts to talk to her. She would also do weird things like turn her back to me while she wiped off her makeup (whenever I walked by her side of the room). I just found her behavior unsettling and strange. Then, mid-semester, she started doing things that bothered me. She didn't take out the trash as much as I did, and changed her menstrual pads in the dorm room and threw them in the trash. I know this because we would change under our lofted beds at our desk and one time I heard the wrapper. I will say that she did wrap her sanitary napkins in tissue, but I still knew what they were when I saw the trash. She also left her desk light on way too late/early, sometimes she left her laundry basket in the way (she'd do her laundry and not put it away until the next day and just leave it sit by her desk), and used my plastic silverware (I said she could use it, but I moved them to my side of the room because she used them too much. Since she still used them even after I put them on my side of the room, I decided to hide them.) Eventually, we had bed bugs. We had to clean out our room so pest control could treat it. I was like, ""Are we gonna get reimbursed for this?"" She didn't say anything. I was like, ""You don't know, do you?"" She said, ""yeah, sorry idk..."" Later on, one of my male friends came over to help me pack my stuff. My roommate walked in the room and glared at us. As she bagged her stuff, she would stomp around and she also slammed the door a few times.

Eventually, I told the RA that I didn't feel safe, it was an unfriendly environment, and I was afraid my roommate would judge me if I confronted her about tidiness. The RA met with my roommate individually, then the 3 of us had a meeting together. My roommate was really irritated because I didn't talk to her first. She also didn't believe I was intimidated by her.

Her: I have a right to be upset. Why did you say I made you feel unsafe???""

Me: ""Because you glare at me, and stomp around and slam the door! Wouldn't you be scared??""

Her: ""I was stressed?""

Me \*slowly\* : ""So is every other college student...""

Her: ""I don't believe you're scared of me though...""

Me: ""That's because I told my parents about this and they told me not to act scared so I don't give you power.""

Her: ""But...you weren't even friendly...??""

Me: ""I offered you cookies! And you blew me off!""

Her: ""But....it's not like I threatened you or anything! Saying you don't feel safe is a very bold statement to make.""

Eventually, the RA asked in our roommate agreement what we wanted our relationship to look like.

Me: ""Professional.""

roommate: ""Fine. Whatever.""

Then the RA asked about cleanliness. I said, ""Sanitary napkins should be changed in the bathroom, and I looked this up-body fluids spread disease and pests and that ALSO makes me feel UNSAFE."" (I'm pretty sure my roommate was the reason our bed bug situation was bad) At the end of the meeting, my roommate signed the agreement and burst out of the lounge in tears....she kept the room clean the rest of the semester, but we stopped talking.",24Jul2019,0

109,"I'm a female and I live in a very toxic family and household. When I was young about 4-5, me and my mother had to snatch me away from my biological father's hands  and run away to another country. Why you ask? He had several issues regarding alcohol, in short words, he was an alcoholic. I still remember this as this was a very shocking and memorable event that happened in my life, and it came rather early. Because of this, I learned from a very young age that a family is not always perfect and people have let me down ever since. The worst thing is, that I now live with my mother and my step-dad which I have no words for because I hate him more than anything in this world, and you may think teenagers hating parents okay this is pretty normal, but he is a disgusting and unlovable person and I wish he'd never step in my life. My mother was very loving when I was young, but since my parents got married, everything changed. My mother started being more abusive and more care-free, she changed infront of my own eyes, I found out that I had no one left to trust anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no way of escaping blamings for absolute no reason, physical and mental abuse, very hurtful comments about appearance, how I act and what I do. Never have I experienced my parents like normal people sitting down, talking to me about my problems or things I have going inside of my head, it's always shouting or screaming at me to stop acting like a baby and grow up. I always see parents in movies being so loving and caring for their children, and I often do not want to watch movies due to this as I just get upset, and feel very unlucky. They act like psychopaths, telling me they are going to sell me, send me to another country, or when they're angry, say very threatening comments like ""I'll smash your head on the wall if you don't shut the fuck up"" or a very common one ""I'll kill you like a dog"". How can parents say this to their child? This I will never understand. I'm used to this because it goes on daily, but I've had enough due to an incident that happened today, which made to write this reddit post. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother rarely cooks for me, I haven't eaten anything all day and I decided to confront her about it. She took it as an attack and said very aggresively ""I won't cook shit if you're hungry do something yourself"", so I went upstairs and she came up behind and started screaming in my face ""who do you think me and your dad are!"" and proceeded to grab my arm and smack me on the head.

I used to have what seemed like a mix of anorexia and binge eating disorder. I'd go days starving myself only to binge eat to follow. My relationship with food was terrible. This would then affect my mood and my relationship with myself. I literally hated myself and everything about myself. I had a friend--who I had deemed close--who knew about my eating habits. But instead of asking me if I was okay or trying to support me, she cut me off. She once told me she wanted to be close to me and be there for me. But when she cut me off, she said I had become such a negative person (to myself) that it made her feel bad about herself. Which I kind of understand. No one wants to be around someone who constantly talked about their poor habits or self-hatred.

But now that I look back on it, I really needed help. And for her to lead me to believe that she was going to be there for me... well, that obviously didn't happen. I'm not beating myself up over losing a friend I once had, but it kind of sucks knowing that someone tells you they'll be there when you need it only to leave you when it affects them.

My ex broke up with me just 3 days before our 1st year anniversary. Needless to say I was a mess. He helped me deal with my eating disorder. He didn’t heal me for sure but he helped me (maybe I was to dependent on him I’m not gonna lie). I loved him so much but I admit I was moody sometimes and we couldn’t have sex because of me (we still did some things but sex was not okay). I really tried hard to overcome my issues and when he broke up with me he told me I was really getting better. I deserved to get dumped I wasn’t a good girlfriend I know it because he left me to try to date another girl he spent a few nights with. When he broke up with me he also told me that he could maybe love me again later. And I still think about it all. The. Time. Even if I know that it’s stupid and that it won’t happen. 


When it was over, I was a crying mess. 1 month later I was good. 2 months later we were both invited at the same party and I really messed up I was drunk and I told him « I please more girls than you » and I insulted him. I still want to apologize but everyone told me that it was a dumb idea. One week after this incident we had another party together and he was flirting with a girl (who’s a model) but honestly I was okay and I spent the night with my friends. Finally I was okay without him that’s what I thought and oh lord was I wrong.

Since everyone went on summer vacation I am all alone now. And I started thinking about him again. And I started drinking alone and crying at night (I can’t tell my friends about it because it’s pathetic). Now I’m the worst, I stalk him on social media.

And I feel powerless and alone again. Time doesn’t heal at all. And another thing I can’t tell anyone is that I’m really envious of them having great relationships and others getting over their exes. I know the problem comes from me and I have to get over it but how am I supposed to do ? I miss him all the time and after 3 months it was supposed to get better. I got kicked out by my mom and he’s the one I want to talk to he was the only one who could listen and keep me from doing stupid things (such as getting drunk alone because I can’t sleep or deal with my emotions).

120,"     My ex and I broke up about a year ago and we were together for about 18 months before that. Our communication and love for each other  was healthy and strong until the naive and idiotic guy I was grew bored with the relationship and wanted to live a bachelor lifestyle. I know she would have never broken up with me— I was perfect in her eyes, although in my own retrospect I’ve come to acknowledge the many times I was wrong to her.
  
     During our time apart I didn’t live out the lifestyle I planned to due to relationship issues my parents were having whom eventually divorced. I grew close to both my parents during this time, especially my dad, who taught me the importance of valuing a significant other and the necessary mindset to have in a growing relationship. I grew distant from friends during this time, moved out my dads and started paying rent to sleep on a stranger’s couch. This became an important learning period for me and I started practicing self realization and growth.

     I can’t speak entirely for my ex and can only provide from what I heard since we weren’t talking during this time. She took the breakup hard and grew depressed according to her friends. She was always a more reserved type but after some time became a heavy flirt and had flings with a number of guys. Her confidence was through the roof but she was taken advantage of at times. This period eventually came to an end and she grew depressed again. After some time she redirected her confidence to modeling (I remember being happy to see this since she is very beautiful but previously had strong insecurities and shyness). She found a new person of interest who she is now currently dating and they do seem very happy and healthy together.

     During both of our lowest points in the breakup I asked her to lunch so I could apologize for the person I was ( this was around the time I was talking with my dad and she was having her flings). I wasn’t looking for closure and sincerely wanted to say sorry for my behavior. She didn’t say much that day but I could read all the mixed emotions in her face and eyes. I could tell it was hard for her to listen to me, yet alone look at me. It seemed she was recovering and had negative feelings towards me which I understood. 

     Fast forward two months ago when we were both on a Yosemite trip together. We have crossover friends and we were in two different groups of a caravan that met there to camp. Nothing but small talk between her and I but tensions were gone and and we could now joke in the same group. There was progress.

      Now fast forward to last weekend at a friends get together. She’s there without her boyfriend and hanging with her girlfriends while I am hanging with a different group. We didn’t really acknowledge each other until our groups collided and we all began socializing. I noticed that we both slowly stopped talking in the group and began to speak to each other directly. It felt completely natural as if 12 months of distance hadn’t passed. We were never alone and stayed with at least one other person which I think was good. There came a point in the night that our eye contact grew intimate and I could feel love. Our conversations and distance remained appropriate given her relationship status but there was a heavy loving energy that I’m certain was mutual. It ended up being just me, her, and the host at the end of the night when we went our separate ways— I don’t think either of us wanted to leave. We did a lot of conversing and catching up that was built on how well we still know each other. We both insisted that we keep in touch and acknowledged how nice it was to reconnect.

     I feel like I don’t deserve the closure I received the other night and I feel selfish to say that I think we belong together and will eventually find each other again (though I do have total respect for her current relationship). It’s possible that I’m just delusional in my feelings and we just have a mature respect for each other, but deep down I know it’s more than that. I just feel as if we both did a lot of growing when we were apart and the love never died.  I can say with certainty that I can’t imagine being with anyone else. No one brings me as much comfort as she does.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in my last year of undergrad chemistry, if all goes well, I should have my bachelor's degree by the end of september. If all went as planed beforehand, I should have already had graduated chemistry, 2 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Little background: 

&amp;#x200B;

I was born an extremely talented, but impulsive child. I developed an eating disorder as early as 1 month old (I was born weighing 10,25lbs and have already grown to be 17,5lbs by the 40th day of my life).

&amp;#x200B;

My mom sent me to kindergarten, and I got into trouble the first day; some little girl took away my toy so I ripped out a part of her hair with skin attached to it (I was 2 so I don't remember that).

  
Although I got in trouble almost every day, kindergarten teacher told my parents that I'm talented, because I was already drawing in 3D by the time I was 4.

&amp;#x200B;

I crushed elementary school with maximum grade average. Although I was an excellent student, I had issues with pornography already in 6th grade. At one point I non chalantely masturbated in front of the whole class, and the whole school knew about it (I found it out years later but whatever). My English teacher also knew that I had the hots for her, and my classmaster (whatever you call it) confiscated my phone due to it being full of porn (even then when maximum brodband had like 300kb/s).  


Anyways, the core of all my issues was that I was obese. At the last grade of elementary school, when everyone's hormones are hitting their peaks, I was 5'11 at nearly 270 lbs. I played handball at the time, and I easily could've ran an entire half time without going out of breath. I masturbated 8-12 times on average, and honestly have no idea how I didn't get suspended or at least a call home from school, because I often groped my female classmates.

&amp;#x200B;

What frustrated me was that I couldn't get with a girl, but I was somehow ok with it, since I was only 15 - really not a big deal at that age.   


Girls mostly friendzoned me because how the hell am I supposed to have game when I look like an overgrown child, while my friends were at least ripped although skinny.

&amp;#x200B;

Got into highschool, grades started going down the tube even though I totally blocked every other activity due to having to study so much. I got friendzoned another couple of times, and I still suppressed it because hey, you can't blame girls for not liking you that way. I grew up to be 6'2 - 6'3, with naturally big shoulders and was often complimented as cute.

My beard started growing, and because of sh\*t genetics and depressed gamer hygiene, I got a zit in every spot I got a new hair on the body.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of my friends started hooking up at a time, and I sank even lower down the deep sink that is depression.

I started hitting the gym, but couldn't sleep due to running away from my own self - even my own reflection in the mirror. Imagine having to be somewhere 7 hours a day, study and write another 2-4h, going to gym for an hour, and coming home, just to lay in bed from 11pm and fall asleep at 4am, 3 hours before it's time to get up.

No sleep = no gains = more fat + more apparent fat + more zits + grogginess...the list goes on to moon and back.

&amp;#x200B;

I was frustrated by the fact that I had no access to women simply because my whole body represented me as some guy that just protects and serves, getting nothing in return (you aren't required to give anything, I know, put your torches down).

&amp;#x200B;

""And that's when I discovered drugs, and that's all I gave shit about"" - Louis C.K.

&amp;#x200B;

At the age of 17, I was suddenly smoking 3-5g of weed a day, taking diazepam, lorazepam, bromazepam, had alcohol tolrance so high I could drink 3L of wine in less than an hour just to feel alright. I took 40-50 ecstasy pills from the day I tried it to a month after. I tried cocaine, and got well into amphetamine.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, fast forward to college, at first I got into chemical engineering. First year I got by even with my DSPD; I drank coffee, A LOT of it (up to 20 espressos every day), but I still slept 2-3 hours during weekdays. Didn't do drugs other than weed because I was living with my sister, whom I've respected a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

In the second and third year in college, my depression got the best of me. Sister graduated and moved away, and I started smoking weed all day without skipping, and doing lots of drugs. Lots of good memories, but still no girls. Who needs these bitches anyways when you're rolling your ass off right?

&amp;#x200B;

But I still yearned for the warmth of the female body. I just wanted to know if I was missing anything, to not feel like a total outcast when someone mentiones their girlfriend, or at least talk about their hookup(s).

&amp;#x200B;

I got picked up once by a girl in some club; I just asked her for some drugs and she gave me a kiss (well, a 20 minute slob) after we started rolling. She gave me her number but ghosted me shortly afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't pass one subject from the first year that got me failing 3 more times; meaning; I had to repeat the first year 3 times, never having passed it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Combining with everything I said above, I got full on nihilistic. I took my parents money (lots of it) and somehow managed to earn a lot on the crypto market, and ended up spending all of it on darknet markets.  I was shooting speedballs, smoking weed, taking LSD, smoking DMT, all kinds of fucked up RCs, every fucking day. I lived like a homeless junkie, delusional of his own state of mind. At one point I realized that I haven't left my apartment in a month. I would get high and masturbate for hours, stay up for days, overdose on opioids and somehow still stayed alive, and all of that because no matter how much I trained, dieted and really tried to do something with myself, I couldn't look well enough to be sexually fucking attractive.   


And don't get me wrong, I was far from shy, I talked to girls who seemed to have liked me at the time, but my lack of confidence (and every non retarded human knows that *confidence comes from experience*) always got the best of me, and I'd make up a reason in my head (""she's probably just friendly/bored/knows I'm harmless"") to why I'm not gonna pull the trigger, or even if I did pull the trigger, I'd come off so.... the opposite of smooth(?) or soft that they mostly just give me a smile and hug.

&amp;#x200B;

The more I failed the more I thought I'd fail again = less and less confidence, the same way people who do manage to pick up girls get more and more confidence the more success they have.

&amp;#x200B;

After I failed the said exam for the 16th time, I had to drop out (university's policy). I will never forget when my dad, with tears in his eyes, who always gave me everything, told me that he calculated how much I've spent and didn't amount to anything.

&amp;#x200B;

It broke me.

&amp;#x200B;

I just thought to myself: why do I have to be so retarded? why do morons get to pass this stupid ""memorize and write"" bullshit and I have to move and start anew? why do I not have a sibling so I can off myself and end this stupidity.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved to another town, to a university whos professor of the same subject isn't a greedy stick up their ass cunt, who makes 780 out of 800 students fail the test every time it takes place. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was an alcoholic for 3 months; drank a liter of rum every day.

&amp;#x200B;

At one point I read somewhere: *""The only thing you're guaranteed at birth is death. The rest is earned""*

&amp;#x200B;

This became my mantra. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still used drugs but I started controlling them to enchance me as a machine I need to be in order to get through this shit. Just as I climbed out of the Deproabyss, like Batman from that prison, just when I was on the peak of my success - I met the most wonderful girl whom I love more than life itself now, and who was stunned when I eventually, after a few months, told her the truth - that I was inexperienced before her and was afraid to tell her in fear she wouldn't give me a chance. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason she didn't believe me was because she often asked me ""who taught you that?"" after intimate sessions.

&amp;#x200B;

Althought things worked out fine in the end, and although I'm currently in credit card debt, fighting some deep seeded mental issues, and drug abuse here and there, I can finally, wholeheartedly say: **I'm happy. I'm happy to exist right here, right now.**

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see it, once I finish this fucking torture that is education, and get ripped till the end (currently doing 2 workouts a day, gym and balling, and managing my diet as much as my wallet allows me), I will feel free.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't care how annoying my job is gonna be - at least I'm gonna be payed for it.

I don't care that I haven't fucked when I was a teenager - I have a woman who loves me, and who made me realize that I was packing two oranges and a snake (which was hard to notice and believe when I was 35-40% body fat)

&amp;#x200B;

I went through more than 10 years of going over zebra and begging for a car to sweep me off my feet. Of listening other people's stories about how happy and lucky they are. But I won't be them - I won't rub my happiness in anyone's faces. I'll keep it down. Why? Because there are millions of teenage me's all around the world, begging whatever deity they believe in for some things many of you take for granted.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish you all the best, fellow humans, and remeber:

125,"Here is a list of the things that are making me want to cry every night:  

1)My anxiety has caused me to self harm again, giving me scars during a bloody heatwave.  

2)My parents are restricting me from going out, because I’ll be camping next week; I need to get out because they cause my stress.  

3)I’m Christian and so are my family, but my parents are homophobic and my sister and I are closeted bisexuals. She has a reciprocal crush on one of her best female friends, but she can’t date her, and it makes me so upset.  

4)My best friend had an argument with his mother about her homophobia towards him(he’s bi) and he got kicked out that night.  

5)I love this guy who loves me back, but we can’t be open about it, because my parents won’t let me date until my studies are over(I have three years left!) and he’s not Christian, so it’s worse.  

6)I’m on summer holidays, and I’m dreading it because I hate being at home; my dad and my sister argue almost all the time, and I get worse anxiety around him, because he’s my trigger.

128,"     My ex and I broke up about a year ago and we were together for about 18 months before that. Our communication and love was healthy and strong until the naive and idiotic guy I was grew bored with the relationship and wanted to live a bachelor lifestyle. I know she would have never broken up with me— I was perfect in her eyes, although in my own retrospect I’ve come to acknowledge the many times I was wrong to her.

     During our time apart I didn’t live out the lifestyle I thought I wanted to due to ongoing issues between my parents whom eventually divorced. I grew close to both my parents during this time, especially my father, who started teaching me the importance of valuing a significant other and the necessary mindset to have in a growing relationship. I grew distant from my friends during this time, moved out and starting paying rent to sleep on a stranger’s couch. This became an important learning period for me and I started practicing self realization and growth. 

     I can’t speak entirely for my ex and can only provide from what I heard since we weren’t talking during this time. She took the breakup hard a grew depressed according to her friends. She was always a more reserved type but after some time grew into a heavy flirt and had flings with a number of guys. Her confidence was through the roof but she was taken advantaged at times. This period eventually came to an end and she grew depressed again. Some time passed and she redirected her confidence to modeling (I remember being happy to see this since she is very beautiful but previously had strong insecurities and shyness). She found a new person of interest who she is now currently dating and they do seem very happy and healthy together. 

     During both of our lowest points in the breakup I asked her to lunch so I could apologize for the person I was (this was around the time I was talking with my dad and she was having her flings). I wasn’t looking for closure and sincerely wanted to say sorry for my behavior. She didn’t say much that day but I could read all her mixed emotions in her face and eyes. I could tell it was hard for her to listen to me, yet alone look at me. It seemed she was still recovering and had some negative feelings toward me which I understood. 

     Fast forward two months ago when we were both on a Yosemite trip together. We have mutual friends and we were in two different groups of a caravan that met there to camp. Nothing but small talk between her and I but tensions were gone and we could now joke in the same group.

     Now fast forward to last weekend at a friends get together. She was there without her boyfriend and hanging out with girlfriends while I was with a different group. We didn’t really acknowledge each other until our groups collided and we all began socializing. I noticed that we both slowly stopped taking in the group and began to speak to each other directly. It felt completely natural as if 12 months of distance hadn’t passed. We were never alone and stayed with at least one other person which I think was good. But there came a point in the night that our eye contact grew intimate and I could feel a mutual love. Our conversations and distance remained appropriate given her relationship status but there was a strong loving energy that I’m certain was mutual. At the end of the night it was just me, her, and the host when we went our separate ways— I don’t think either of us wanted to leave. We did a lot of catching up and subtle reminiscing built on how well we still know each other. We both acknowledge how nice it was to reconnect and insisted that we keep in touch. 

     I feel like I don’t deserve the closure I received the other night and I feel selfish to say that I think we belong together and will eventually find each other again (though I have total respect for her current relationship). It’s possible that I’m just delusional in my feelings and the fact is we’re simply mature and have respect for each other now, but deep down I know it’s more than that. I feel that we both did a lot of growing during our separation and the love never died. I can say with certainty that I can’t imagine being with anyone else. No one brings me as much comfort as she does.

     Time will tell.",24Jul2019,1
129,"Let me just start off with me and my boyfriend are both young and dated for over 9 months. In the relationship we were so happy we had so many good memories together. The bond was insanely deep and we would tell each other anything. We were happy for long until towards the middle of the relationship we started fighting. He had a lot of issues from past relationships and that influenced ours heavily. There were a lot of red flags. My friends were really worried for me and I questioned things. He’d yell and became different from the person I thought I knew. This went on for months until we went of a break that only lasted 3 days. Of course that didn’t help anything. We both thought we’d be together for a long time and wanted that. More recently I broke up with him. It was maybe one of the most painful things I had to do but he wasn’t ready for a relationship. He wasn’t treating me right and I couldn’t handle it as I was also his only support system and he was codependent on me. But we broke up- both wanting to get back together after we’ve changed. We agreed that we can take as much time as we need to change and then revisit things- we were both kind of banking on this. But even when we weren’t dating, we still fought. I’d always try and cool down the arguments or avoid them and sometime sit seemed he was picking a fight. I was really lost bc I didn’t know if I’d be making a mistake getting back together with him. I had a gut feeling. So I decided to contact two of his most recent exes for clarity. What I found out was disgusting and I don’t think I will ever be able to trust anyone the same. The one girl who had described their relationship being toxic, it was almost IDENTICAL to our relationship. That really hurt to hear as he did the same thing to her and would manipulate her as he did with me. He said so many of the same things to her he said to me and said he didn’t say to anyone else. I then talked to his other ex who he had dated probably a year or so ago. She came out and told me he sexually assaulted her and harassed so many others. I was distraught I couldn’t stop vomiting and I couldn’t think straight. I had no idea, but I can’t say I couldn’t see it. As he was sexually forceful with me. I confronted him about it the next day. At first he flat out denied it but eventually said he regrets what he did but he did assault her. He says he was immature but he’s different now. Which I don’t know what to do- I want to believe him but I can’t. My trust was broken. He told me he didn’t tell me this because he wanted to wait until I loved him enough so I wouldn’t leave him. There are so many other red flags I didn’t mentions. But it seems every time i talk to him, I second guess myself. This is the most I have ever been hurt. Someone who I considered my best friend and the most important and deepest relationship I had ever had, lied to me the whole time. He says he’s still loves me but this is so so hurtful. Because one side of me knows it’s disgusting what his actions were but for months I thought he was the one and I would’ve trusted him with my life. This is one of the most painful things I’ve ever endured. My mom and friends don’t want me anywhere near him which I don’t think I should but the urge to talk to him is so painful and the lies are so painful.  What do I do from here? Am I overreacting?",24Jul2019,1
130,"I've started seeing my ex again who left me 3 years ago then shortly after was already off dating someone else (this is a common thing for her) and I'm still in love with. She has recently cut us off after 3 months claiming ""I need to focus on myself before I deal with anybody else"" to which I can understand, she's recently discovered she has mental health issues and is trying to sort them out seeing a counselor, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to keep in contact with her stay friends because I aim to end up in a relationship with her again if it's possible, I still love her after all. She doesn't have many guy friends or many friends, in general, the guy friends she has don't live anywhere near her, she doesn't often stay out late unless she's at work but tonight she has. I know she's been on a dating site since we stopped seeing each other again. Tonight she was out with a guy friend for a few hours where she let him use her phone to message people on a dating app as her which to me indicates that they are very comfortable. I'm probably overthinking this whole thing but I can't help but think that she's already found someone else to date and just won't admit it. She's probably banging him as I type this and I can't do anything about it. The one person I love, the person that has been on my mind for over 3 years, the person who I would have very happily married if we'd stayed together, the person I've had more than my fair share of breakdowns over.

She mentioned she was ""going out later"" whenever I asked if she was going somewhere nice or something general conversation things it just got point-blank ignored. I just can't help but think that she's sacked me off, gone off to some other guy once again.

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, I am likely overthinking this but I can't help it. It has me so worried. I've dated one person since being with her 3 years ago and that person was an abusive psycho. I was so happy to be seeing her again, she was happy too we had good sex and good laughs but as soon as she decided she wanted to stop us, I've barely got a response out of her.",24Jul2019,1
