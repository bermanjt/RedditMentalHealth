0,"When I was 16, I was in a terrible state. I could describe everything that ever happened to me to make me so terrible, but that's a long story so I'll keep it simple. 16 year old me was gay and terrified. 16 year old me got beat up in a bathroom half naked because a bunch of straight girls didn't like the idea of me being around. 16 year old me developed symptoms of PTSD(?) and lashed out constantly at her friends as a result. 16 year old me had most of my friends leave her because her friends knew they deserved better treatment. 16 year old me couldn't make new friends because she was afraid of other women. 16 year old me tried to kill herself because she had little support in her life and failed. 16 year old me caused someone to call my school about my attempt and alert my parents about the situation. 16 year old me went to therapy for years until she graduated, because that was the only way she would improve.


Well, now I'm 20, and 16 year old me would never believe the kind of life we have. I'm not overly successful, but I'm doing alright for myself. I got into an good college and I'm so happy to be where I am. Therapy helped me tame whatever hell was tearing through my attitude. Many of my friends didn't come back, but the two that did are my best friends now. I have a great support system. I still struggle with trauma, but I learned how to trust again and got over my fear of other women. I even got a girlfriend, who is beautiful and kind in so many ways I never thought I'd get to see. 16 year old me would of never known this life if she had died. 16 year old me believed she'd go through life lonely and angry, like how she was in highschool. 16 year old me thought that her life was all she'd ever be, and she was wrong.

I wish I could back and give 16 year old me a stern talking to. 16 year old me wouldn't believe how happy we become after graduation, but teens just be like that I guess!",27Aug2019,40

4,"For this of you who don't know, when something posted to Facebook violates copyright (or seemingly does) the company sends out a takedown notice and the video is blocked from being viewed until it's settled. 

The OP of the content has the option to appeal the takedown notice. If the appeal is accepted, the company forgets about it and the OP of the content gets off scot-free. 

If the appeal is DENIED, the OP can appeal the denial, but if THAT one is also denied the OP is banned from using Facebook (or Instagram, or messenger) for a certain amount of time. 

Anyway. Every time NBC has copystriked me, I have appealed with the reason of ""Fair Use Act - Parody Content"", one has been accepted, 2 have been ignored, and probably 7 or 8 have been rejected.

When it was over I was terrified and stayed at home for like 2 months (I live with my parents and had savings so i was fine), my savings were running out so I was like “fuck it, ignore the fear and just go”. 

I found this job where I have to file government documents and was interested, i really wanted that job but it only had one vacant so that made me almost not go to the interview but i did it anyway. When I got out of there after the interview I felt calm, I didn’t felt like I nailed it but compared to past interviews I had where I got too nervous and sweaty, I felt pretty with it.

The days after all I could think was “I’m probably not gonna get the job” but it didn’t really mattered that much, that interview made me feel more comfortable and confident, I was less scared of looking for a job because my experience when good. I was still ready to be rejected, I don’t know, I guess my mind always thinks like that so if I don’t get it I won’t be disappointed and if I get it I’ll be pleasantly surprised, I already had another job in mind to immediately go if I got rejected.

In the meantime, I’ve started a landscaping company and we’re serving our first clients this week, which I’m actually pretty excited about. 

I’ve got a few different hobbies (calisthenics, fishing, learning interesting things, golfing, gaming), none of which I believe I’ll be good enough to monetize (Except for golf) or achieve a high level of greatness. Nevertheless, I still enjoy them. 

I’ve got my real estate license, but never could really dig myself into it. Florida, the state where I’m from, is a tough place to get going especially as a 21 year old, but I know that’s a shitty excuse. 

I let 3 loves of my life go, and due to other complications I just want to focus on myself before I drag someone else into this mess. I’m happy with that conclusion.

Every day from the time you're about 5 or younger is just dedicated to getting you ready for that. School isn't meant to actually educate you it's meant to get you ready to work. You'll go through 13 years of K-12 which will give you varying levels of actual education based on how much money you're born with, but ultimately it's just preparing you for college where you'll spend $50-$100k+ to get the right to spend your next 40-50 years at a job you probably hate. 


You'll probably be too tired whenever you're not working to do anything you like, and no matter what it has to be an afterthought. You'll be miserable 5/7ths of your life and then get drunk on the weekends to forget about it.


Don't forget to pay off your student loans, get a mortgage, new cars, credit cards, pay your taxes to a government that doesn't care about you, go to church, get your white picket fence a dog and 2-3 kids that'll cost about a quarter million each. There's a 3 digit number you'll be enslaved to and if it gets too low you can kiss your well-being goodbye, you won't be able to do anything. 


Oh *also* make sure you don't ever EVER get sick or injured or you'll probably be draining your wallet to total destitution. 


Maybe once every 5 years or so you'll get a few extra days off to do something you like, but probably not. Your job no matter what by definition will get as much work out of you for as little money as possible. 


Once you're 70 or so you might be able to retire and then this is the good part! The part you've been waiting for! You finally made it. This is everything you've ever worked for. You finally made it, you put in your 40 hours a week for 40 years and now it's finally time to enjoy life. You can do anything now, you've earned it!


Except every single joint in your body is stiff and in agonizing pain, you have trouble breathing, you can't walk up stairs or long distances, you can't control your bladder or bowels, you have to take 16 pills a day and you're gradually forgetting literally everything. You also probably have cancer. Like, everywhere.


But yeah, be grateful you're alive. It's a gift and how dare you ever question that. The world is literally ending, the government can and will murder you or let you die if it suits them, and it's illegal to be born poor.

39," 

I  (M26) have not dated anyone in roughly 2 years. My last relationship  was serious and it was very painful when it ended. The reason it ended  was because I was unable to truly trust my ex. She brought up that I  hadn't really trusted anyone I ever dated, therefore I am not really  able to love. That may not be a generally true statement, but I really  resonated with her words and I believe (in the case of me) that she was  right.

I don't mean to sound like  I'm blaming anyone, but that issue was born from my horrible choices in  girlfriends during college. I recognize that those situations, and the  resulting negatives were my fault. I should have left them way sooner  than I did.

My first girlfriend  (let's call her Anna) there didn't spend much time with me, every  weekend she and her friends would go to frat parties. She didn't want me  to tag along. Should've just moved on.

My  second college girlfriend (let's call her Kara) was actually a very  good friend to me. Because of this, the relationship carried a lot more  weight to it in my eyes. The caveat of this situation is that initially  she didn't want to be a couple, just fuck buddies. I admit that I was  confusing good friendship for love. However, she did agree to become a  couple eventually. Kara and I spent a lot of time together, much of it  in bed, but also just laughing and hanging out. She too had a penchant  for going to frat parties every weekend, never wanting me to tag along. I  would try to suggest we do things together, but they never  materialized. She willingly admitted to cheating on me every weekend. I  SHOULD have left immediately after learning this, but I foolishly  believed that I loved her. Again, confusing good friendship and kinship  with romantic love. Over time, she said she'd try to stop cheating on me  and I, for some reason, gave the situation more chances that I  should've. I asked if she'd cheated on guys before, and she told me she  has cheated on every guy she's dated. I asked her why she did that, and  she admitted to me that she ""likes watching people lose control of  themselves"". Unfortunately I didn't find the strength to break up with  her and eventually it ended just because she felt like it was going  nowhere (...well she wasn't wrong). This really messed me up because I  viewed her as a good friend as well. Being hurt by someone I was dating  who should've cared about me, not just as a girlfriend, but as a friend  really affected me. This is when my trust in people, in general, began  to erode.

Now,  let's skip over the other girlfriends/dalliances I had in college and  head over to 2017. I had been dating a really sweet girl for two years  and we had a really deep connection. I won't get into details, but we  met in a really unlikely way and it was only for movie-like reasons we  were able to date. We were fairly close to each other's families at this  point and everything was all honky-dory . However, I was always  paranoid about guys hitting on her or her entertaining the flirtatious  nature of some people around her (particularly one guy who was  interested in her at her work that she talked to, but never really  mentioned me to). I really shouldn't have let it get to me, because she  was not the kind of person who would've cheated on me. She was aware of  Kara's affect on me and she hated her because of the paranoia it spawned  in me. Eventually it ended because the paranoia ate me up and she got  tired of me never trusting her (i.e. asking about that guy at her work,  darkly and sarcastically joking that she was with some guy while I was  traveling for work).

After  she told me that I was unable to truly love anyone, because of my trust  issues, I decided that maybe I'm not ready for a relationship: period.  Over the past two years I've spent time figuring who I am and what it is  I really believe. How honest was I really being with myself? Was I  expressing who I was honestly? Was I trapping myself in situations that  were bad because I went after what I thought I wanted, versus being  honest about what I really wanted? Was I letting ""what I thought I  wanted"" contort how I perceived people and my relationships with them?  Anyways, I feel that I know myself better now and I feel a bit more  self-aware.

Now onto the purpose  of this post! I've moved to a major metropolitan area and I've met  someone kinda cool at ""Ye Local Coffee Shop"", while waiting for my  laundry to finish at the laundromat. I haven't been able to get this  chick outta my head, for some reason. Not in that creepy ""I think of you  all the time"" way, but like she'll pop up in my head every once in a  while and I'll smirk or something dumb. It kinda spooked me because I  haven't allowed myself to feel like that about anyone in a while, but I  digress:

Do you (fellow redditor) think that maybe I'm in a better place, at least enough, to give dating a shot again?

46,"All day today, I've been feeling sick to my stomach.   
Nothing new, I guess. I'm always stressed, and have been on pills for my stomach before. I also have anxiety, and tend to get an upset stomach with that, too. Basically, anything bad happens, and my stomach is screwed.   


I also had to work today, so I just did my best to live with it. I grabbed some ginger stomach chews, forced myself to eat during break, and continued on with my day. No big issue...   


Until I got home.   


I had to go downstairs to get..... well, by the time I got there, I couldn't remember what!   
I was wandering around the kitchen, trying to remember why I'd come downstairs. I usually eat when I get home from work, but I wasn't exactly hungry.   


Then I saw them.   


On the dark kitchen counter was a pile of freshly picked raspberries from the yard.   
I don't exactly know what happened.... I'm guessing it was because I didn't eat enough today (thanks, nausea), but I stopped dead in my tracks, rushed over to the pile of small red fruit, and began to SHOVEL them into my mouth with both hands!! It was like I hadn't eaten in days! The last time I'd had that strong of an urge to binge food like that, was when I was very sick with my eating disorder. I just couldn't stop myself-  


Until I saw the bugs.   


To my absolute HORROR, I could see what looked like a small army of spiders(?) spewing out from the pile of raspberries.   
I froze again, conflicted. It was like some sort of whiplash. Part of my brain was still struggling to make my hands shovel food into my face, while the other half was blaring red alarms in the background.   


Then it hit me.   


In a blind panic, I spat the raspberries back onto the counter. But then I realized that they were still in my mouth! I think I swallowed some....!!   
Now, pausing here.... I hate tap water. I have a serious germ phobia focused around water. I only drink water from this one source that I ""know"" is safe.   
But in my panic, I RIPPED the tap from the sink (it's a hose type) and began flooding my mouth with water, rinsing and spitting over and over again.   
I gargled, spat, rinsed, spat again....   


But it wasn't enough... My body started heaving, the nausea that had been bubbling all day, now uncontrollable.   


I started shaking and gagging, desperate to rid myself of the horror I may have consumed.   
But you know how, sometimes when you barf or gag, it's so forceful, it makes it feel like your head is going to explode? Or it makes your sight go wonky?   
This happened to me.   
I felt like I was going to faint as I struggled, dry heaving, to expel the potentially bug infested raspberries from my body.   


So, I fell to the ground. I knew if I stayed standing I could pass out.   
Gagging, I huddled against the tile floor.   
Eventually, I threw up. Repeatedly. On the floor.   
It was terrible... As an adult, I couldn't help but think ""I should be doing this in the toilet.... I'm making a mess!""   
But I was so shaky and unsteady that there was absolutely NO way I could stand up, much less make it to the toilet....   


Slowly, I began to feel somewhat better.... I reached for the light so that I could clean up the floor, but I felt like that would make the insects even more visible...   


I'm still shuddering at the image of it.... even in the darkness, I could see the spiders(?) just.... exploding from the pile of raspberries... Eugh.   


Thankfully, I like to think I have a good sense of humor. So while I was absolutely horrifying at the time (and still sort of is), I can also look back and laugh a bit. I think I learned a valuable lesson today. Or three. Mostly, to check the food I'm about to eat. But also not to eat in the dark. And possibly to never eat raspberries again haha",27Aug2019,4

I almost died 2 years ago and was sent to the hospital for 2 weeks in the ICU – organs were about to fail.

Fast forward to now, I am astonishing healthy, I’m working towards a marathon and now mentoring other people get better.

Along this entire journey I’ve had a wonderful prayer for the past 10 years, we will probably get married soon.

**Issue is...**
After this traumatic past, no matter how hard I work on my values, I am still painfully atttracted to females that I can sense had a troubled past.  

I hate the fact that I might never feel that way towards my current gf.  I hate that I can’t get with someone I do feel for, because it’s almost certainly trauma related.

52,"I’ve been lurking around here for a few months and figured fuck it why not post?

I will be as brief as I can 
I am in my late 20s
My childhood was lonely af and a general mess. Nothing drug or alcohol related and I’ve never been arrested, just crap like being lonely bullied opportunities cut off or otherwise ruined by pretty much everyone. My mother raised me by herself in a filthy house and she was an angry psycho who would hit me, break things in the house, would say extremely degrading things and there wasn’t really anything positive to balance it out.

My dream career simply didn’t happen because once again opportunities cut off and when your mother has isolated you and kept your from making connections since day 1 it’s kind of hard to know where to start.

Throw in a few failed relationships, getting knocked up and and almost committing suicide. Being screwed over by pretty much everyone I thought I could trust for their own personal gain as well.

Okay fast forward to now. Some good things have happened, like I am in a really healthy and rewarding relationship and life is okay as far as job, house, car etc.

My issue is I have lost the zing for really doing anything. Yes I still enjoy things like my dogs and hanging out with my SO but when I was a teen I loved learning about things in depth and becoming accomplished at something. Now I have no motivation to really dive into anything like that. If I come across something that interests me I’ll maybe look up a few superficial facts about it and then whatever because what’s the point. My talent for my dream career is still there but it’s dried up and rusted, I don’t even know if I could do it anymore even if I tried to: the excitement and the bursting creativity is gone. If anyone tries to talk to me about things that I really know about i might give like half a fact and then shut up.

Basically I’m stuck in this “who cares what’s the point nothing is gonna matter when the world blows up” mentality and I don’t see how to get out of it. And I really don’t talk to anyone about it because let’s face it nobody wants to hear your problems.

Any ideas?",27Aug2019,1

My confidence has taken a beating both in my work and my home life...I’m running on empty and low—I’m working hard and mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausted.

56,"I was always the successful kid. Good grades. Everybody was impressed by my intelligence. Then I got bullied when I was 13. I got depressed, I had to retake classes.

Then I recovered. At the age of 18 I caught my schools principles attention. I didn't go to school for the entire year, but in the final exams I had a perfect score. He invited me to his office and we talked for 5 hours about physics, philosophy and so on. Afterwards he told me that he will follow my career with great interest and that I could be one of the great man that go down in history if I keep educating myself. He also offered me private tutoring etc.

It felt so good that I finally got validation and on top of that it wasn't from some random person, it was from a really successful man who is in control of multiple school all over the country, involved in politics and really educated and smart on top of that.. And I really felt special. I mean imagine that all your classmates are sitting in their class while you have a really deep conversation for 5 hours with a man that has succeded in life and is 50 years older than you and you can still keep up with him when it comes to knowledge.

And then I got bullied again. I retook a class again.

Now I'm 20. I'm still going to school. I will be done with it in 1 year. I have perfect grades, yet I had to retake 3 school years. All my friends from my past are done with school and will probably be finished with uni when I start going there.

Meanwhile besides going to school I work on a project with 2 psychiatrists because I found a possible solution to cure and incurable disease and they both thought that this might turn out right so they agreed to work with me. And I can't tell anybody about it, because nobody would even believe me.

It sucks so much. My intelligence and education are not at all reflected in my career and everybody thinks I'm a loser that amounts to nothing. And everytime I tell people about what I do besides school they just think I'm a narcisstic or that I'm lying so I don't appear like some loser.

59,"Opened a throwaway account for obvious reason. This is going to be a long post.

I was born in early 1990s. My childhood was a mix of good and bad. My parents were making it in life when I was young, so I was having a decent life with mostly what I wanted until my father married another women when I was 10. My mother was a tiger mother and wanted to raise me like a trophy. She was too strict, only study, no game. I had zero friends growing up, because I wasn't allowed to go out or spend time with friends. I could barely go to my cousin's. My parents got separated and despite my mother hating the other woman my father married, I was in good terms with her and my father. They used to spoil me with gifts, favorite dishes and what not. But I always lied about hating her in front of my mother and relatives. Because I was terrified my mother would give me hard time for it.

Later, I started developing a habit of lying. I started lying about my mother being my step mother to my friends. Father started cutting off ties and paying for us gradually and our economic situation was not as it used to. We started becoming poor from being well off. It was my mum's savings and nothing else. But I started lying about our financial status to my friends/more like class mates.

By the time I was in class 11, I started dating a guy and for no reason lied about where I am from. It did not end well. He was a good man. I finished my 12 and wanted to get out of my mother's place and lied about getting in a university in a different city and staying in its dorm. She never came to check as she was financially not stable and always tried to spend little money as possible. So I went on lying about studying there for years. In the meantime, I did not go to any college or pursue any degree but started tutoring kids and making payments from those. I lied to them also about my family status for no reason. I tutored for years and never wanted to start studying. I spent all the money I earned in whatever things I wanted to buy and never had any savings. This went on for years. Then I met another guy and again lied to him about where I am from. And one lie led to another, I started living a life of lie. I started telling people I am from a different country with a different name and many other lies that came with it. This went on for years. In these years, I started working on different firms, and there I lied about being a professional of something I had zero skills in. Those works obviously did not work out but they could not find out of the lies. I made many friends from those places and all of them knew me as this fake persona I made myself of.  I wanted to get out of this rut and decided to stop contacting everyone I involved. I started living alone without any friend, doing nothing significant. I always managed to get good tuition and paid my bills through out with those. I had no clue what to do with my life, as all my friends know of that fake persona, and my family thinks I have graduated and doing good job whereas I am earning sufficient money but just being a tutor. No graduation, no nothing. I felt like there's no way out, so I decided to attempt suicide on my 28th birthday. (Yes, so many years of lying). But then, I met a guy and I don't know I fucked it up by lying again with the fake personality I created. This went on for another year. He was abusive. But I was still with him because I did not know where to go, who to turn to. But then one day I could not take it and left it and went back home to my mother. (Who still did not know of this guy or that I haven't graduated). The guy started asking for forgiveness and I thought maybe this is the time to come clean. If he knew me being a liar all along, he himself would want out of this relationship. So I explained it all to him and surprisingly enough, he said he does not care about it and wants me back which made me think of how good of a person he is and I forgave him for his physical abusive behaviors. We decided to get married. I talked to mother about getting married and he promised me he would not let my mother know about my lying, I also did not let my family know about his abusive behavior. We got married. But he became more abusive in the given months and in the second month into the marriage, one day I ran away from the house we were living in and told my mother about his beatings. My family wanted to talk to his family and wanted divorce. His family and he came over to our place and told my family about the past lying and accused me of being the reason of the beatings as he can not trust me anymore because of the lies and that's the reason he beats me. My family was shocked learning about my lies and did not know how to process all these things. So they asked for some time from his family. In the meantime, I started to communicate with my previous friends whom I lied about being this fake person and wanted to come clean but somehow one of the friends figured it out and they all talked to each other about it and they publicly humiliated me for being a liar and also some of them exaggerated of me being a thief too. *\[A few of them made a facebook group and added everyone there, and started talking trash, all of them asked me why did I lie, I blamed my mother and my family at that time, some of them was disappointed in letting them down, because they believed in me and some of them repeatedly humiliated me and then made a public post about me being a liar all along and also added a few exaggeration like taking loans and never paying back and stealing stuffs\].* It all went public and despite asking for forgiveness thousands of times, they kept on humiliating me and bringing other things that have never happened. I knew there was no point in telling them that I was planning to come clean, so I deleted all my social accounts and came home to my mother. My mother and other relatives all saw it go public and started asking about everything. I came clean to my mother again and a few of my relatives and stopped contacting all of my friends. It has been a few months since then. The divorce is still in the process. My mother initially wanted me to go back to my ex husband thinking it was my fault but then she realized it wouldn't work out, partly because the relationship started of with lies, also because a person who beats you once, will always find another reason to beat you again. \[My ex husband beat me 8 times in two months of marriage, I have no count of the beatings that happened before marriage\] My ex husband's family is still trying to pin it on me alone. They definitely have the upper hand given my friends have all turned against me for the lies.

I am not trying to be a victim in this case. I fully acknowledge of what I had been doing and I am not holding grudge against anybody, not even my ex husband. It has been a few months since all of these ended. I have started living with my mother. I don't do anything at the moment. I am thinking of getting into college the next year and tutoring alongside to help my mother  financially a little. I am going to be 30 in five months. A few of the friends have reached out since then (not the ones who publicly humiliated me) and motivated me for a new start. Some of them normally started talking again as if nothing has happened/changed. My mother and relatives have also stopped talking about these things. They are trying to be supportive and helping me with therapy. Despite my attempt in getting out of the spiral of lies, I could not get out it after trying for years. Then all of these happened, I am actually very grateful that this happened.

These days I am trying to become a better person than I ever was. I stopped lying. Completely. I don't even lie about a tiny small thing. Now when I talk to anybody, I take a pause, notice what's in my head, if its a lie that I am making up, I talk to myself and tell myself there is no need to lie, there is no reason to be who you are not. And then I form my conversation.

This was my life, a life full of lies. I am happy I overcame it. I am grateful for what happened. I am motivated to do something with my life from this point. I want to be a better person, a person who never lies, never blames anyone for her failure, always be truthful to herself, and love herself for what she is.",27Aug2019,1

66,"I’m Studying a language at a university in my hometown, I’m in the beginners course. The teacher asks the class to split into groups for a group presentation that will take place in the next month. I group up with everyone on my table and most of everyone else has a group, except for one girl... 
she is very shy, large and (at least to me) not attractive. After realising she didn’t have a group yet, the teacher addressed the class about possibly dividing groups a little more evenly so as to try and include her in one of the groups. No students really made an effort to change anything about the established groups to try and include her (most of the people who were grouped up were already well acquainted with one another). Not long after the girl begins to cry and runs out of the room with the teacher following her out. Eventually things get sorted out and she joins one of the groups and they make her feel welcome, but this is just the context to the question I’ve been asking myself ever since; why didn’t I feel worse about this? 

In high school I remember being in very similar situations as this many times. I understood what it felt like to have low self esteem, to be shy, feel like you are an Outcast in an environment where you shouldn’t be, so it did hurt me to see another person going through the exact same thing right in front of me. However I had this voice in the back of my mind, telling myself if she really wanted to fix these issues she should just worked on herself. I had learnt to do it so I expect it of everyone else but it isn’t that simple and I understand that but it still affects the amount of sympathy I have for this person. Another major factor was how attractive I thought she was (or wasn’t) and how that affected my outlook, I’m sure if she was an attractive person and the same thing happened I would of cried on the spot but somehow her appearances affects my level of sympathy and that fact is really messing with me, I don’t want to think like that but I do. 

The question I have is posed in the title; Do most people truly think like this? Am I slightly psychotic or amoral because of my thinking or is this just how we function due to our past as a species? 

P.s 
Please don’t take this as a jab at the person, I truly do sympathy with what had happened as it’s a lot more painful then it first sounds, just not as much as I had hoped I would. Try to be unbiased and objective in your responses (if anyone even reads this haha).

Hey there.

Maybe someone has already thought of this, or said this in this subreddit but here it goes. I've posted this in another subreddit, but didn't get many responses and really looking for something helpful.

So Im a 20 year old male. I recently got out of high school and in the workforce. I feel like my life is a mess. Im going back to school because i dont like what i do at ALL. Honestly, my life has felt like a video game from the start, if i had to compare it to anything. I completed all the levels (School) and after school, i completed all the side missions (buying a car, apartment, etc.) and now im in free roam. And like any game after you finish, free roam is only fun to a certain extent. After a while, it just get boring, right? Id love to do another play through, but of course thats not possible.

I've joined the gym, and all other kind of extracurricular activities to ease my boredom but nothing seems to work. I even found a girl I like, and started dating her. (Before this i liked to focus on myself and had no interest in a relationship.) Im trying to fill the void, but nothing is helping. Any ideas on what i can do to stop feeling this way?",27Aug2019,3

73,"To start, this is my first post on Reddit so forgive me if anything is not the average format. This is also a bit of a rant, probably not worth the read. But feel free to skim through.

In the past year my life has gone downhill significantly. I am a 21 year old female, I have anxiety, depression, and OCD that kind of meshes into my eating disorder. Everything has been amplified by a HUNDRED. My anxiety has morphed into agoraphobia (which I've struggled with in the past as a 14 year old), my depression has turned into a horribly cluttered and disorganized bedroom that with each passing day seems to accumulate more and more mess. My eating disorder is better than it had been in the past but I'm struggling to acknowledge that gaining weight is a good thing. Every therapist has said the same thing, ""You are too self aware for your own good."" 

So being that I am aware of all of my problems and all of their individual solutions, why can't I progress? That seems to be the only problem I have that isn't clear to me. What human my age, doesn't want to go out and experience life? I can't drive, I don't go to school, I've been out of work for over a year, and I struggle with even picking up after myself. I want to do better, because I have decided not to kill myself, therefore shouldn't I put in the effort to live?

I seemed to have peaked in the beginning of 2018. I was living on my own, working consistently, I lived in an awful house,  but still all of these very basic things seemed like a huge accomplishment. I even broke up with my abusive boyfriend at the time who would always say horrible things to me and just treat me as lesser than him. I started going out (albeit with some more than questionable people) and I eventually reconnected with my high school sweetheart. Life was going great I saved up a ton of money and decided to move to the city. That my friends, was the beginning of the end of my peak. 

I moved to philly, I lived with my boyfriend, and then I asked my parents with help moving. My boyfriend lived in a nice little apartment in Univ. City. I was moving in a bit further west. My father agrees to help me move (I cannot drive) and in one day all of my possessions were in my new home. Problem is that he was disgusted with the area. I was a 5'3 105lb female moving from a suburb to a city that I was relatively unfamiliar with. He did not take to kindly to this. He and my mother fought with me every time  we spoke begging me to live with them. Along with that I had been applying to as many places as I could and I never got a call back. The dream I had of starting over in a new city with my friends had started to crumble. Paying rent started getting harder and harder with no income. I was stupid to think it would be that easy. I finally gave in and agreed to move back in with my parents. A crushing blow to both my self esteem and any hope I had at being independent in the future. 

So where am I now? I am stagnant. I have no motivation and a deteriorating mental state. My boyfriend moved out of his philly apartment and back in with his evil grandmother who kicked him out after a month. So he lives with my mother and I. Luckily she likes him a lot and is very understanding. I feel stuck in my situation. I have no money, and I live off of the good graces of my parents. I hate who I have become, falling back into a self deprecating, narcissistic stupor. 

If you read all of that, thank you for your time. I do appreciate the thought of people reading this and thinking I'm as dumb as I believe I am. I also haven't slept in a few dozen hours so I apologize for any errors in this. Did I mention I also have insomnia haha. 

Wish me luck on becoming a person again.

76,"Today I had the worst wave of sadness that has hit me so far. The feeling of worthlessness in me is often triggered by something completely trivial and stupid, even in the vein of ""I feel so inferior to other guys I know"" and ""person X thinks I'm annoying but refuses to tell me"". The initial feeling started during my last lecture of the day. I went home and spent about an hour and a half listening to sad songs to kind of let my feelings out, but by 9pm I was fucking bawling my eyes out. Everything I felt over the past few years or so, even things I didn't know I felt just surprise attacked me all at once. I wished I could change the past. I wanted to not be the way I am now. I wished I hadn't been born in my home country. I wanted to talk to my dead grandmother of 7 years one last time to ask her for advice (until today I thought I had completely gotten over her death years ago).

These feelings of low self-confidence stem from being bullied at high school and excluded at college (and now it seems the loss of my family member as well). I'm studying in a foreign country and as of recently I'm starting to feel more and more like an outsider, because I can't seem to find more than 1 person who has a personality like mine. I'm seeing a therapist right now while in University but today was the first time the feeling got so bad. Any extra help you guys can give me is well-appreciated.

What are your biggest regrets in life so far? Mine is that I haven’t tried to apply to Oxford. I don’t want to brag myself, I just feel that the chance slipped through my fingers and sometimes it makes me nut.I’m 19 years old (soon 20) male from Poland, beginning my second year at uni here. During my whole education I’ve felt that we - Polish students - were instilled that only the absolute educational elite can try to apply to Oxbridge. Whereas I’ve always been the student that treated exams with a pinch of salt and ignored the subjects that seemed unnecessary for me. I’ve always treated Matura (our equivalent of A-levels) as the final point of high school education and fully focused on that. The result? I’ve wrote 4 extended subjects for over 80% (including 94% from English), I’ve also wrote an exam from maths, that I’ve actually screwed up, whereas I’ve got probably the worst school average from my class.

I was always convinced that there was no point at trying to get into Oxford, I didn’t even bother with checking the requirements. I’ve applied for few universities in Scotland for Business Administration, however the first choice denied my application due to the score from maths being to low, and although second choice accepted me I didn’t really want to migrate.During my first years at university, I’ve met a guy who was applying at Oxford (I mean - he began the first year at the same uni, however, same time he’s decided to apply to Oxford at geography, the subject that he was truly fascinated by and was a laureate in few competitions). I’ve met him closer - he was friendly and curious, but I wouldn’t say that he’s belonged to the intellectual elite. I’ve thought, “If he applies, why don’t I?”

Unluckily, I’ve checked Oxford’s internet page day after applying deadline. I’ve checked the requirements for Polish with Matura exams - my score matched the requirements for PPE, the subject that I think would be really interested in. I know that there are more stages of application to come, however I think that I’ve could get through them.

Why I don’t apply now? As far as I know, after 2 years of studies (I would finish my 2nd year if I went to Oxford right now) outside UK I’m not entitled to student loan. I’m from quite wealthy family for Polish standards - however, the fees equal to our 20% yearly income if not more. Besides, I would regret the waste of 2 years of current studies and also I’ve found a girlfriend here and it would be a pain to leave her here. Also, the whole Oxford society seems very specific and with my character I think I could not match. Although I still wonder whether to apply - and the deadline is in 1,5 month. Despite all the odds, who knows, maybe I would pass through? And if I haven’t, I would know where I stand.

Thanks for attention.",27Aug2019,1

81,"Let's just say that when I was a kid, I wasn't the best at dental care

So one of the premolars in my lower jaw has been practically rotting away/decomposing since i was 6-7 (I don't remember exactly) and had the dentist fill it with,...well...filling ever since. It was never really a problem for me. The filling got out had to be refilled a few times. But now i fell it has started to show its ways. 

Last Saturday, it was hurting like hell! It hurt with every heartbeat. I went to the dentist and she said it was a good time to take it out now. I had to be on pain killers for next three days before they could do anything. The pain killers, unfortunately took a little while get going after I swallowed them but I was like ""whatever, I getting this tooth out anyway, I shouldn't care!"" Although meal times will disagree.

Tuesday came and I went there. They sprayed the thing in my mouth which gave the awkward numb feeling. (If you are a dentist or you have had a tooth removed, you know how it goes) After that, I knew they would give the injection so I closed my eyes and tried to not panic. (I had another injection in my mouth few years before this)

I did feel it in my jaw though so I had to do my best to not move from pain. I kept my eyes closed nearly the entire time. While we were at it, the dentist kept telling sweet things like ""if you feel anything, raise your hand that's on the opposite side"". 

When did the tooth got removed, I didn't even notice until I saw some blood in the tray and the dentist held it in front of me. I wanted to keep that bad boy so badly. 

I'm currently at home writing this with not able say anything for 2 hrs (max) and a cotton ball in the right side of my lower jaw pressed up against my upper jaw. After that I will have something soft to eat (even ice cream!). 

I have further check ups by the end of the week and more pain killers while we ware at it. I will update then.

Like I asked if it was okay if I called him dude. He was like “uh yea of course.” My ex wouldn’t let me call him that or anything causal, because “he was my boyfriend, not my ‘dude.’” He has such high standards for respecting him that I didn’t even know were red flags until now. I also asked if it was okay that I didn’t let him know where I was at all the time. Or who I was with. As I asked that I realized how nuts and controlling it was. I couldn’t even kiss my exes hand or buy him flowers because that wasn’t my “role” in the relationship.

I began a space-themed half sleeve over the past 3 years from a local and popular tattoo artist who has a decent instagram (over 100k) following due to his unique artistic and personal style. He's posted over a thousand pics of his work on regular clients and celebrities with each one receiving thousands of likes. Mine included... or, it did, before I checked last night and noticed he had deleted it.

I'm still trying to process it, but him deleting the post of mine is bothering me. I can only think of two reasons he would delete it: 1) He doesn't want asked to do space themed-work anymore, or 2) He doesn't like the work he did on me. Either way, he doesn't want it representing him as an artist. I've always felt proud of it and proud of him doing it, but knowing he doesn't feel the same makes me feel less confident about one of the few thing I actually felt confident about myself.

I still occasionally receive some nice compliments about it, and it feels good when someone says they like it because it's now just as much a part of me as any other exterior part of me. I know I shouldn't allow someone else's choices effect my self esteem, but understanding that isn't making me feel better. Now it's just a reminder that no matter how much I tell myself I don't give a shit what other people think, I still do.

A part of me wants to ask him why he made the choice to delete, but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't find the answer I'm searching for. I feel too embarrassed to admit out loud that my feelings got hurt, and I'm not sure if it's healthier for me to stuff it down, or address my feelings head on.

I can relax and stay in pajamas all day or shower at noon. Go to supermarket, run errands. Have tv on. Lay on couch alot. Exercise a bit. 

THE PROBLEM: Like I say it's very Lonley being in ISOLATION every day. I talk to no one. I do have the option of going to a city office but I have no team there so I would sit alone in a guest cubicle but at least people would be around and the hustle and bustle of office life.

Am I stupid to commute an hour just to go to an office in the city to walk around at lunch. I can watch tv on my phone or browse reddit at the office as no one is watching me.

That is, until i was in front of the judge, and the moment came where he asked if i agreed to the terms of the divorce judgement, and i panicked. I blurted out, "" no, i want to dispute the parenting time.""

The judge was taken aback and everyone in the room tensed up, and the judge said, ""ok... you know this is a judgement of divorce? And you have had plenty of time to dispute the order, but you wait until the last possible minute?""

I told him that i had been trying to work out an agreement with my (now ex) wife, but it hasn't worked out.

He proceeded to say he is going to make the judgement of divorce anyway, and if i want i can file a motion to have parenting time changed in the future. 

To explain a little bit, we have a 3 year old son together, and the court order currently in place says i get 2 (3 day) weekends with him per month. The change i want to make is to get 3 (2 day) weekends per month, which is the same number of days, only redistributed in a way that i can actually see him instead of being at work and missing an entire day with him. 

We have actually been following the 3 (2 day) weekends plan since May, but now she wants to go back to only 2 weekends, and she can because that's what the court order says. 

Anyway, i know it wasn't the right time to dispute it, and not only did i make myself look like an idiot in front of everyone in the courtroom, i also irritated the judge and REALLY pissed off my ex wife.

I just want to keep things as they are instead of going back to the pure torture that is seeing your child only once every other week.

115,"So I was recentlyReading a couple stories in r/ChoosingBeggars, few of the “TalesFrom” subreddits, and r/AntiMLM especially, and was thinking to myself, there has to be a way to fuck with these people in an extremely annoying, but ultimately harmless way. That’s when I remembered about this prank that was pulled something like 10 years ago or a friend of mine.

Basically, one day out of the blue, my friend (we’ll call him VOP, or victim of prank) randomly started getting text messages and emails, about 10 a day, from random numbers inquiring about a free goat for pick-up. This went on for a few weeks, and throughout that time, VOP what is progressively getting more and more frustrated with every text and called a quiring about this free goat.

FINALLY, it came to light that SOMEONE (we never found out who did it, which somehow ultimately made the whole ordeal funnier) had posted a Craigslist advertisement with my friends first name, phone number, a picture of a young-ish (but not a baby) goat, tethered to a post in someone’s yard with a bunch of hay and other food (I think - mind you this is a decade ago), with a caption/short descriptive paragraph basically saying that VOP has a pet goat that he loves but unfortunately can’t keep anymore for personal reasons, and is trying to give his beloved goat away, for free, to a good home. 

In my opinion, this prank was close to a 10/10 for execution as it was overall harmless, caused VOP to launch multiple freak out episodes, took WEEKS to figure out the cause of the texts; 10/10 for creativity because shit, I personally would never have thought of that, and it’s hilarious; I’d also give it a 10/10 for choice of victim, because at this time, VOP was a hard-ass, ragingly toxically masculine weed-dealing asshole who robbed people (including “friends”) regularly and had a “no one can touch me” type of attitude, so the freakouts at a mystery person were priceless.

It started at a house party in Seattle. I met a girl on Tinder who I never hooked up with. We were friends, she was also a prostitute.

She said it was harmless, so I thought ""oh, okay this is fine!"" I did it once, had fun and then moved on with my life.  


THEN I got this fucking job. I was so stressed I started smoking tons of pot, cigarettes, and drinking. I still felt I needed to go a little further. I decided to get the whole set up for whippets. The canister, the balloons, the NO2 cartridges. At first I would get high as balls and then do one to end the night, but then on weekends I started wanting to do more. Soon I was going maybe 3 times a day, only stopping when I ran out and had to order more from Amazon. But she said it was harmless so ""Oh, okay this is fine!""  


This last shipment came in. I immediately got started. I did one, but wasn't satisfied. So I did another- I felt funny but didn't quite pass out. So I did another and I realized I was passing out but my body was dropping everything as a defense to ODing. THIS WAS NOT FINE.  


I was so stupid to do any of it. Why  did I think a hippy prostitute was a good role model when it came to drugs? Why did I think going three in a row was a good idea?

Everyone has a mean spirit in them next to the kind. That’s just humanity I guess. But it hurts. 

I’m not very masculine at all. This was apparent even as a toddler. I would play with barbies. I would look up to the women in my life more than the men. I would always be envious of pretty dresses and makeup and would not want anything to do with cars or sports or whatever. Even now I am this way.

Why must I abide by the strict rules of society that a straight man must be very masculine and completely unbending?

I hate it. And while I love myself I’m very sheltered as a 26 year old man. I’ve turned away multiple possible relationships. Platonic and romantic. I’m very self conscious now. 

Many men have flirted with me (more than women have, though I’ve never really had issues with women coming onto me too), but when I tell them I’m not interested or that I’m not into men, I get bullied by them “you just haven’t come out of the closet yet”. You have no idea how many times I’ve heard this. 

I always get asked if I’m gay. That doesn’t offend me at all, I know I’m pretty feminine, but what does offend me is that they don’t accept that I’m just not like they are when I tell them. Men, women; coworkers, family members, they’ve all done this to me. For my entire life. Because of this, I’ve been shunned by most men in my life. Bosses, my dad, grandparents, peers... men don’t take me seriously. 

But even my ex wife did this to me. 

Maybe the people I surround myself with are just shallow and closed minded. I don’t know. I just want to be accepted. I’ve been shunned for being who I am, and it hurts. 

I’m now someone who I despise. I used to love myself. Be proud of myself. When I was a teenager I gave my middle finger to the world and dressed more femininely, I dated and didn’t let certain toxic men tell me I wasn’t man enough for my girlfriends (they did this a lot) and I just lived life not caring what others thought. Until I was 22 and then something changed in me. I now am very quiet and isolated. I have pushed everyone from my life. When people negatively remark on my height or my feminine traits or on things that I can’t or won’t change, it’s like daggers to my heart. I can’t handle it the way I used to be able to. I’ve been single and a shut in for nearly 5 years now. I’ve lost all of my old friends. Could I date? Sure. People have come onto me a lot in the last few years. I always turn them away. I’m not confident enough in myself to feel like I could maintain a healthy relationship. For this I’ve been called an incel. (Which doesn’t make sense to me?) It never ends. People are so critical and judgmental and rude. I hate that I’ve become so bitter.

I really wish I could overcome feeling so inadequate. There are people who love me. And I love life and I love the people in my life. But I live in such a small cage when I feel like I should be arm in arm with the world. 

I don’t know if this is something I can ever overcome.",27Aug2019,3
119,"I use illegal substances to treat my MS symptoms. We started in October 2018 and I've tripped about 8 plus times since then. 

When we first started, I had next to no good cognitive function and I was morbidly obese and constantly fatigued. My memory was shit. My energy was shit. I was sinking into a black hole i didnt understand. My relationship was fucked and I was spiraling out of control mentally and emotionally. 

Boyfriend convinced me to trip with him. At the time we didn't know the mushrooms would help my MS symptoms. 

It was like someone connected a loose circuit, and it felt like that in my brain. When we first started having me trip, I would have a moment where it was like my brain restarted. Like when the power goes out and the back up generator kicks in. You could literally watch my brain reboot while tripping. 

I've lost 80 pounds, I work out everyday now. I have way more energy more often. My quality of life is soaring.

But I can't share this ""medicine"" with others. I have friends with MS that come up to me and ask me how Im doing so well. I tell them, try to at least, but always get a negative response. Because mushrooms and acid are still illegal. I would love to tell my doctor in hopes that they would push for more alternative treatment methods, but I'm sure she's getting paid big bucks by big pharma.

 I know that states are pushing for MDMA therapy for mental/emotional disorders. That's awesome! Dont get me wrong, but we could be treating so much more. 

Eventually the US will wake up and see how backwards we have been and when that time comes, I'll be waiting with open arms.",27Aug2019,4

124,"I've been with my girlfriend for 10 months.

Some side info:

* When we got together she told me it has been 5 years since she was last in a relationship and that her previous boyfriend abused her.

* she told that 1.5 years before she went travelling around Europe and visited Greece (my country) with a girl friend

When we met she was working in my country temporarily and told me she was applying for a position at her company in Belgium and when she got back home to the Philippines she was submitting her passport for the work visa. A couple months after she submitted it, the company said they would not wait for her to come there and she told me she was cancelling her visa application.

Months go by and her passport hasnt arrived. She told me she was in contact with the embassy and didnt know why it was taking so long.

We talk for months, every day. We spend hours on Skype, sleep together on Skype, have date weekends, play games online together.... I let her into my heart completely. I bought tickets to go see her and am supposed to go there next week. A few days ago her passport arrived and she started acting weird. She told me her aunt was going to sponsor her for a working visa and her mom was forcing her to go. I looked up the details about the visa and theres nothing like it online so I confronted her about it. She told me I just needed to trust her but I needed more info because it sounded like she was getting herself into something sketchy. After trying to make more excuses and tell me more lies, she finally told me it was a cohabitation visa and theres some guy over there that she has been planning to go live with and this has been in the works for years. She didn't travel Europe with a girlfriend she travelled with a guy who she called her boyfriend.

I found an online review a few months into us being together where she reviewed a restaurant in Athens and said something about having a boyfriend. I confronted her about it and she said it was her female friend she was traveling with. Now I know it wasnt. It was her boyfriend.

She has continued to have been talking to him these past 10 months, he says stuff like he misses her. She never told him about me

She has lied to me almost every day in one way or another. Whether I ask about her passport or we talk about past life experiences.

Recently she made me feel so guilty because my friends surprised me with a trip to Santorini for my birthday. She told me it was her dream to go there with a guy and since I had never been I told her we would go together and she could show me around. She made me feel so guilty because that couldn’t happen that it ruined my trip. And now I find out she had been there with her boyfriend.

She told me she doesnt love him, that it was always just for the visa, but that makes me feel worse. It’s so gross what she was willing to do just for a Visa. She told me she slept with him twice just for that visa. She didnt even break it off with him when I started getting serious about coming to see her. To make matters worse, her family is what set up the process for her to do all of this gross stuff for the visa. She feels like a really gross stereotype and her family disgusts me.

Before we got together I had lost my child and it destroyed me and my ex. I never thought I would find love again but I did. This woman took my heart and made me feel like I had hers. We had dreams and plans and laughed and cries and I confided into her about everything. And all along she was lying to me. Apart of me knows things should end but I don't want to give up what we had. I don't want our love to end. Who will I wake up to every morning? Who will I fall asleep to? Who will I laugh with, play games with, share everything to. How will I know if shes okay? I cant stop thinking about the lies, how she told me to trust her about the visa, how she had some back up guy. But I don't want this to end :( I love her so much.",27Aug2019,5
125,"On the first of this month, [I made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/cklw9a/new_month_new_me_hopefully/) saying that I was basically going to try out a ""new month, new me""-type thing and try and put my life back on the tracks and actually start caring for myself again. This includes showering, brushing my teeth everyday, exercising regularly, and cutting out most, if not all, junk food. 

I never thought I'd still be doing this, but here I am. 27th of August and it's actually working. I've felt really good this month! Sure, I still have my down moments, and there are still things that I need to work on (like my anger and swearing issues, I'm like a damn sailor lol) but overall my life's been on the up! I've showered and brushed my teeth probably more times this month than the rest of this year combined, I've almost completely cut out junk food, I've exercised a good bit (at least for the first half of this month, but I'll get into that later), I've finally made a friend for the first time in over two years after battling some pretty bad paranoia and trust issues, who has also chose to join me on this ""new month new me"" thing (can't think of a good name for it) and he's been a very good inspiration, and I've actually lost weight! I've dropped below 60kg (132 pounds)!

This past week has been kinda rocky for my schedule because I had to go get emergency surgery which screwed up my whole daily showering and exercise thing - doctors said I can't exercise for up to six weeks which sucks, but I'm not going to let that stop the rest of the things I'm doing. I'm planning to keep this up for however long I possibly can.

I think I'm gonna be okay, guys. :)",27Aug2019,4
126,"In October 2018, my father was diagnosed with Stage IV esophageal cancer. As the journey goes, some major life changes have come about. I was finishing up my last year of community college, with intentions to transfer to my dream school, UCLA. However, things didn’t turn out that way. I ended up getting in to the school, but had to turn down admission and chose to attend a school closer to home that I could commute to and help my family. But the wrenches continue to be thrown in and don’t seem to stop. 

Both of my parents have jobs, and even with his illness my dad has not stopped working. Work is his escape; it’s where all his friends are and he gets his mind off of everything he’s going through. Since they work, I have been given the responsibility of taking care of my two younger sisters (16 and 5). Because of this, I decided to take a break from school to help and thought I could use it as an opportunity to get a second job and save money to pay for my university courses when I go back rather than taking student loans. 

Well as of recently, more has been added to the plate here. My dad has been brought into a clinical trial at UCSF to treat his cancer. This is a 2 hours+  commute from where we live and he will need to be there 3 days per week. My mom wants me to trade off weeks with her driving to and from San Francisco for his treatment. She doesn’t want me to get another job, and wants me to take time off from the job I already have. 

Now that you’ve gotten through my whining, here’s my dilemma: I just don’t think it’s fair to me. I understand I need to be helpful, I’ve practically become a homemaker through the last 10 months and have had to put my life on hold. I want to go back to school and get my degree, I want to see my friends and not be stuck at home waiting for my sister to get out of school. I want to use this time off to put myself in a better position for the future. I have a girlfriend who has been with me through all of this and want to spend time with her, but when she has free time, I’m at home taking care of my dad or youngest sister. It’s gotten to a point where I just want to move out of my house and have a life of my own. I feel so out of control and have fallen completely off track of the life I planned on having.

 Every time I have an idea on how to better my life personally, my mom shoots it down because it will conflict with helping the family. She makes me feel really guilty, and I’m at this point where I don’t know if my mentality is justified or selfish. 

Please give me your honest opinion, not what you think I want to hear. Any and all advice will be appreciated.",27Aug2019,1

129,"I found out today that my wife of almost 12 years, been together for 22 total, had serious doubts about me as a partner since our first child was born 10 years ago. Apparently I wasn't the father she thought I would be. 

I didn't know. And she resented the fact that she felt pressured to go to college instead of me. She didn't want to go to school and thought I should have gone as I would have been better at it ""and I knew this."" Her parents wanted her to go to college and she was excited to go to a major University. But she resented me and was angry at me for not going instead of her, and how her life turned out.

My heart and head are so wrapped around this woman I thought had loved me for 22 years as much as I loved her but she quietly resented me for everything I did wrong. She stayed to try to make it work. We had more kids. I didn't know how she truly felt. She never told me. I trusted her and our marriage thinking she felt the same way I did. No matter how unhappy I would have been, I never would have cheated on her. Or betrayed her.

I'm done with this life. My treasured marriage was a lie. I can't even move on. Or support myself or my kids. I thought I won, I thought I had the family I always wanted. I can't stay here and be emotionally flayed by her, I'm not strong enough for that and I still love her intensely. I can't kill myself and hurt my kids that way. What path do I have? 

If you read all this, please treat your spouse with love always, even if they don't deserve it. Don't hurt them even if you feel angry or resentful. Please do the right thing and end the relationship the right way. Don't have kids with someone you don't truly love. Fight for your marriage. Don't let your love for your partner die.

I truly regret not being the husband she wanted me to be. I loved her with all her flaws. She couldn't love me with mine.",27Aug2019,1

131,"Well I really wouldn’t know where to start lol. It’s a bit embarrassing. But there’s this guy at my job who’s been eye candy for a while. I’m going to call him John. I never had any feelings for John, I just liked to look at him. I’d glance or ogle, but nothing more than that, and there was never really any talking either. Well I asked him for help a few days ago and we chatted for a bit and it was simple and friendly. He was a little weird but idk. Nothing I’m not used to before (people at work say he’s a little “off” but I think it’s because people like to judge quickly without really giving people a chance, but everyone has their perspective). 

Anyway a couple of days ago I was asking for help again and idk what was going on with me but every time I saw him I got super horny. It was so bad and I’ve never felt like that with anyone ever, so I genuinely had no idea what to do with myself. At one point he was grunting because he was pushing something and I literally had to run because my reaction in my girlie bits was intense.  When I went home I experienced the worst case of female blue balls in my life. Nothing helped at all. Not porn, not masturbation, nothing. I seriously couldn’t sleep that night because my body was so pissed. I haven’t seen him since and I’ve calmed down a bit since then, but I just didn’t know what to do or what came over me. 

And I doubt he’s into me. Sometimes he glances my way, but then again where we work there’s always something going on so he might’ve just been looking in my direction but not at me if that makes sense? And he smiled at me the other day, which I’ve never seen him do in all my time working there, but under the circumstance he did it, it might’ve been a “I’m so over this dumbass” customer service-esque kind of smile. But other times I think he might be into me, and the part of me that believes this wants to just give in to this delusional thinking, his being a little weird and all. But yea. That’s the whole story.",27Aug2019,1
