0,"On February 24th, I will be 25 years old.

Currently, I am 24 and I don't know what I've really done thus far in my life. I graduated college with a degree in Creative Writing and I've been trying to put that knowledge to use to write a book (series), but I'm stuck. I have Depression and Anxiety and I live at home with two of my brothers and my dad (who is away in Mexico until March, so he isn't even here for my birthday, anyway).

Right now, at this very moment, I am tired. And stressed. 

But mostly tired.",16Feb2019,3

Some of them are dark, some very sad, some extremely good and many are unique. To communicate, I will call you (no video) so PM me your fake instagram account or discord or something like that. I will use something disposable :) You can too. I can call multiple times so I won't ghost you just after the call.

So now I’m a skinny bitch with smaller boobs ( not as small as they were in hs) but definitely the smallest they have been since I graduated from hs!  So the past 4-5 months or so, I’ve been going braless as long as I have layers on. I don’t like to expose my nips - that’s the only reason.

6,"For context, we’ve known each other since middle school and I liked her until we got to freshman year of high school where I became a fucktard and basically abandoned her. After 2 years of not talking to each other, last month, I decided that I should talk to her again. 

We texted each other a lot lately until I’d say around towards the end of last week. She started not texting as much and gave a half hearted effort in texting. Like she’s still engaged in the conversation, it’s just that the energy isn’t where it use to be. She has shit going on in her life about her ex boyfriend (obviously that’s gonna play a role), but still, why can’t she just be honest with me and say that she hates me and/or she’s talking to me? 

What I’m confused about is why does she keep saying that she likes talking to me and FaceTiming me though..? Why does she say that? She doesn’t sound really interested in talking to me. And when we interact in real life, I’m guessing she doesn’t want me to feel bad and so she just plays along. Why do that and not tell me the truth? 

Honestly, I don’t give a shit if she hates me or whatever. Life’s a fucking birch sometimes and oh well, it is what it is. Why does she keep saying that I make her happy and she likes talking to me but she doesn’t sound like she does? Why doesn’t she just come clean and be honest with me? I don’t give a shit about myself so why doesn’t she just tell me straight up the fact? ",16Feb2019,0
8,"  Ever since I graduated from high school and have become an adult, my dad have been treating me terrible whenever I have free time, mocking me, and making me feel pissed. I am currently in college trying to get good grades and well doing what every student have to do to pass college, study, I rarely go out with my friends mostly because they are always complaining about their love life and sometimes their negative attitude can have a toll on me, so I just hang out with them in college. 

&amp;#x200B;

After returning from college I finish my homework in time so then I can have the rest of the day free (basically I only have night free) so yeah, since I have nothing else to do I just play videogames, draw, or read a book and then go to sleep, and then tomorrow I'll do the same thing over again, go to college, etc...

&amp;#x200B;

I remembered one time that I was getting payed for the first time and he didn't even listened. Next day, he just yelled at me saying how I'm wasting my time, etc... Uhhh no, I'm not. I'm trying to move on with life, for the first time I'm going to get payed, and already planning on creating a small business (I already have the provider for the thing I want to do) I also want to take a short online course in Domestika cuz there's a course that I want to learn and apply it in real life, I have so many plans and dreams...

But my dad doesn't know that I also have a life, really. Just because I'm 20 doesn't mean that I have to stop doing what I like and just focus on ""work"". 

It's getting annoying, seriously. The worst part is that he's never at home and doesn't even take his time to know what I'm doing and what I like! he accuses me of fake things such as ""arriving late to college"" ""not doing homework"" first of all, I always wake up early and my assistance is good, whenever he finds me not doing ""anything"" it's because I finished my responsibilities! I always do homework first...

16,"When I was in high school I entered a cycle of my ""friends"" commenting on my small boobs, me making fun of them as a way of take them as a joke, and them getting more comfortable with making jokes about them. A ""friend"" would always send me memes about being flat or saying stuff like ""you're pretty you just don't have a boyfriend because you're flat"" ""I would date you if you had boobs"" ""why do you even wear bras, you can't even fill them in anyway"". 
One of his friends liked me and he even got him to occasionally laugh at those jokes or join in the fun. Yikes. But damn, so many guys from my HS would make jokes about them, even between them and then I would just hear about them from my friends. A guy that used to like me even made fun of them (after being rejected, but honestly that just relieved me because he was really creepy and it took too long for him to accept that rejection)  (anyway I wasn't like bullied or anything, but still, I had many insecurities)


Anyway, when I entered college I just started thinking how girls are so pretty, I don't know, I just think each girl has their own charms, some are cute, some are glamorous, some have flawless skin, some have awesome makeup skills and make their looks shine, some have the nicest hair ever, some are just sO ADORABLE, some have gorgeous bodies, some have other types of gorgeous bodies, some have the nicest personality and I just don't know how all girls are so pretty. I feel that liking my small boobs is just as if someone liked tall/short girls, although most people don't see it like that I just think they're great and I like them.


So then I started thinking, hey, I'm not so bad, even if most people don't like me or don't like my body, even if most think I look 13, I'm not that bad. I like my looks. I like having small boobs, at least I avoided people that would've been into me just because of that, I like looking young I feel adorable, I don't know. Honestly sometimes I wish I could have like a male version of me and date myself I don't know if it makes sense, I'm aware most people don't really like me but I love myself.  The other day I had a friend help me film a video and when I was watching it I couldn't help thinking that I look kind of cute.


Anyway I feel kind of weird because some friends still expect me to have low self esteem, even if they're just joking around.

The other day I said people didn't like me (it came to the conversation because you know, Valentine's) and a friend said as a joke ""nah some people do like you, although I don't see why"" and I mean, it was days ago so by then my confidence was already great, it didn't really make me feel ""ah, I guess I'm ugly and have a bad personality"" because now I don't care if guys like me or not (my few experiences have been creepy, I swear I'm not popular with guys but I guess I'm the type of creepy guys). As long as I like myself I'm fine and I don't know, if I defend my body I will just look salty, but I do love myself, maybe I'm just too busy with college to mind my looks as I did during HS but I started ignoring most of my flaws and just accepting myself for who I am. Not only did I start feeling pretty but now I just think everyone's kind of cute, I used to feel self conscious if I got a pimple but I realized that I don't even notice other people's pimples. Everyone has their own charms. 


Maybe it's because now I don't care about others' opinions and only about pleasing myself but I feel great.

This thread in r/datingoverthirty was pretty much how my Sunday started for me. It hurt to realize the feelings she had may not have been as deep as she said they were or they weren't real at all because of how quickly she lost them. For a long time, I've wanted to feel that mutual reciprocation of feelings and desire again. I thought I had it with this woman but, it turned it out to be an illusion. My friends have been consoling me this past week; what hurt even more is that they all saw her for who she was the night we all met her but, I was the only one who gave her the benefit of the doubt. My feelings were taken for granted, disrespected, and she made me feel uncomfortable about being uncomfortable about how she chooses to cope with self validation and negative emotions (which she claims her sexual prowess gives her power, yet she referred to herself as a ""depressed slut going nowhere in life"" when we got into an argument. I feel like she knows what she's doing isn't helping her cycle of toxicity but, she refuses to change that aspect about herself for fear of losing her ""identity."")  


I'm not as down as I used to be about the situation I'm in, I'm mostly healing better than I thought I would (usually, I'm a broken mess by now). The one thing that I can't shake is that my genuine feelings for her weren't respected, and in a lot of ways that I'm seeing now, essentially manipulated. Finding someone who I managed to have instant chemistry with is rare for me; it's absolutely gut-wrenching that the first one in such a long time used me yet, made me feel like I mattered and was needed.

21,"I was on the slow and arduous road to recovery from depression. Strides weren’t made, but baby steps were. I started to be more positive. I brushed off the little things that put me down.  

I’m slipping again. I missed class for this entire week. Haven’t studied in 2 weeks and have exams next week and still can’t be assed to sit down and study. Any negative thing gets me sad and ruins my entire day. I just sit and feel like crying. I make impuslive decisions that make me feel good or a thrill just to feel something significant inside me. I’ve been making a lot of bad decisions. 

 I’ve lost interest in my future yet at the same time have anxiety about failure. I feel like pushing my friends away. My only 2 friends who helped me through my depression last time. I don’t want to talk to them anymore.

I just want to be alone and sit in my room forever. 

But I already did that once for an entire year and I was miserable. Now I’m failing at rejoining society. I feel like everyone can see the depression on my fucking face.

57,"**I (F/19) am posting as I feel I have no one I want to tell this too, but I need advice and thoughts of some strangers...**

**In short: I feel as I was assaulted by my bf's friend who was my friend of the past year. I was touched, my breasts, stroking my leg and made to feel uncomfortable and helpless. Am I overreacting? I need outside advice on how to cope and move past this. It is ruining my life in general, mostly my social life. I feel unsafe going out.**

&amp;#x200B;

In December 2018, I was put in a situation where I was to share a bed with a guy who wasn't my boyfriend. He was my bf's friend and my bf was also in the room, however sleeping on the floor. 

My boyfriend thought he was doing a nice thing by letting us share the bed and him sleeping on the floor.

We had all had something to drink, however, my bf and his friend had a lot more than me, I had to help them out the taxi and in the house etc...

I was not happy about sharing a bed, and I made this clear to my boyfriend (with his friend in the room) but he was amendment that his guests (me and his friend) would not spend the night in the floor. I should mention that my bf's friend 'John' had become my friend in the last year. 

I know that 'John' was very drunk, I'd seen him drunk before, but not as bad as this.

So, we head to bed and I plan to stay as far on my half of the bed as possible. (it's a double bed)

'John' doesn't, he acts as though we are a couple and he starts to cuddle me. I felt so uncomfortable, he kept complaining about being cold and that's why he was hugging me, so I offered him jumpers and a blanket but he refused. 

He is pushing against me and eventually puts his arms around me, I am in pajamas, no bra, his hand finds my breast and that's when it went to another level of uncomfortable.

I try to push him off while trying to keep a light heartened mood as I don't want to escalate the situation. He just pulls me closer, and I can't move. 

I start to make excuses to get out of bed, saying I'm going to check on my bf on the floor, my bf wakes up and I whisper to him that he should sleep on the bed and let me sleep on the floor. My bf, still thinking he is doing a nice thing, says no and rolls over to go back to sleep.

I go back to bed for maybe 10 minuets and then I go to get up again, this time 'John' pulls me back and doesn't let me leave. I'm stuck, afraid and I don't know what to do. 'John' starts to talk rather than try and sleep, all the while my bf is on the floor, he starts to say things like 'it's bad that I'm hugging my pals bird', 'It's alright as long as he's asleep', 'I think he would hit me if he woke up'. 

This is my bf's friend, I don't know why I didn't do anything other than push him off. It's all good saying that I can be strong and I could defend myself, but then being in that situation, I froze. It has made me doubt myself so much. 

'John' Is on top of me at one point, he has hurt me physically and I have to tell him to get off and stay on his half, which he ignores. 

I manage to get out of bed again, this is when 'John' gets angry. He starts to tell me to leave my bf alone and that hes fine and that i should just come back to bed. I am fighting back tears, i wake my bf and whisper to him again. 'John' in his outrage gets up and leave the room and heads downstairs. 

I have my bf alone and I tell him he has to sleep in the bed. That 'John' is getting to close to me. 

My bf in his dazed just woken up way, is confused. 'John' comes back into the room and says that he is going to sleep in his car. He seemed very angry.

My bf makes me tell him what happened. At first I am not sure if he believes me. 

In the morning my bf texts him and asked him what they hell he was doing. 'John' then phones my bf, it is on speaker phone, 'John' says he has no recollection of last night and that he would never do a thing like that. 'John' asks to talk to me, I refuse. 

I have though about this event everyday since. I need outside perspective, I don't want more of my friends to know. One of my close friends already found out, we were in a pub, I went out for a phone call, my bf came out with me but went back inside as it was freezing (snow on the ground cold) I look up after the phone call ends and I see him, 'John', sitting in his car, I think he saw me, I back into the pub and to the bathroom, I ma crying, turns out some of my friends were in the bathroom and my closest friend notices I am upset and takes me into a stall. I tell her what happened. 

No I feel like a victim. I am sure my bf told his other friend who was out with us what happened, and when I come out the bathroom I feel like some friends are looking at me differently, people are asking me in I am okay. I do not wan to tell any more of them what happened. This feeling of being looked at like a victim is too much. 

I need help, advice, someone to talk to, opinions. 

Do you think I am making this into too big of a deal? Am I right to feel as though I was assaulted? Is that the right word?

59,"I feel that sharing my ""fail stories"" with my friends is funny/relatable/etc. And that's it's a way to ""connect"" with others on a basic level. 

I know doing that sharing my mistakes at work with my work mates is a no-go. But sometimes, I can't seem to stop myself before it's too late. There are times when my work colleagues find the story funny and relatable. But sometimes, I notice an ""awkward pause"" afterwards.

Bear in mind, I only share ""small mistakes"" like ""Oh My God, today was soo hectic with xyz that I completely forgot to pass a message about this."" 

Kindly share tips on how to get better at this.

Note: could it be that I'm insecure and I'm seeking validation for that? (""Oh yeah, I went through that too!"") Perhaps.

TLDR: I'm used to making self deprecating jokes But it backfires at the workplace (of course) because me sharing my small mistakes to my colleagues (even jokingly) might make them assume I'm screwing up a lot but in reality, those mistakes happen minimally especially compared to the ""wins/success"" which I don't share most of the time.",16Feb2019,1

68,"I'm a guy. I match up with this cute girl and we start messaging right away. The first red flag is she starts talking about nudes right away, but I'm curious and want to see where this goes. She convinces me to download Kik (red flag 2) and sends me like 5 or 6 nudes that she already had on her phone. Then she asks me to take one. I'm SUPER skeptical at this point because this girl is ridiculously too hot for me and it's just all too easy for it to be fake. So I just send a pic in my boxers, something I wouldn't care if it got out to other people. She tries egging me on more to send a real nude, but I tell her I have to meet her first at least once and then she can have all the nudes she wants. She says she understands and respects that but its probably not gonna work out.

So now I need to know. I do a reverse image search on one of the nudes. Sure enough she/he was sending me nude selfies of Malena Morgan, a porn star. I'm not mad. I'm extremely curious. Unfortunately she had already blocked me on Kik and unmatched on Tinder, so she's unreachable now. 

So my question is, how does this scam usually work? Is he just a lonely gay guy or girl that gets a thrill out of dick pics? Or does it become like a blackmail thing? Do people make a living like this, blackmailing people with their own nudes?

&amp;#x200B;

For a 20 years now I've been (only barely metaphorically) frozen to the barren hellscape that is the Midwest United States, and I don't know how to get out.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a small town high school and suffered from depression, anxiety and chronic procrastination pretty much the entire time. I did well enough at my academics, got involved in some extra-curriculars like theatre and choir but never actually bothered to go above and beyond anything. Most of the time I wanted to get home to play another round of Crusader Kings II. Me avoiding my problems meant that when it time to pick a college, I shot for a university in the largest city in my state because that ""made sense,"" felt like an easy solution. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I've got one year left, \~$40,000 in debt and potentially a double major in two social sciences (anthropology and economics) and I have no idea what to do after. I want to travel and leave the country, to do something exciting and new, meet strange people in far off lands and get involved in unusual things. Throw myself headfirst into the ever-shrinking global village. But I feel as stuck as ever. My debt prevents me from messing around with whatever income I can get and my lack of hard skills means I'm not useful enough to get a job just anywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally I'd like to leave all my obligations and responsibilities and backpack for a year, but my finances pretty much make that a pipe dream. I've considered trying to join the Peace Corps, or find a position teaching English in a foreign country or even joining the Navy, but those all seem to have their issues (no income, no experience and no desire to serve the state, respectively).  I've got option paralysis. The entire world is out there for me to see, but I have no idea how the heck I can manage to see it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm blessed with the chance to go to college and the fact that I have options, and I feel kinda like a spoiled brat for this even being an issue, but it's still weighing down on me.

Ever since I was 7, my mom would make me pay her $1 for leaving my bedroom light on all day, or the basement light overnight.

I never learned, so to this day I usually leave the basement light on 2x a week. I go to bed at midnight and she wakes up at 7AM and turns it off. When she wakes up, she tells me John, you owe me a dollar.

This morning, it happened again, and I handed over a dollar thinking how fucking broke I am and how much money I have given to my mom over the years.

So I decided to do some research. I unscrewed both the basement and bedroom lights to find out they are both LED bulbs.

I did some googling, and found out that it costs 1/8 cent per hour to leave an LED light on. Multiply this times 7, and each time I do this, it only costs .875 cents EVERY TIME. 

I realized she had ripped me off for 99 cents each time this happened. 

MY OWN GODDAMN MOTHER.

Further math told me that, since I do this 2x a week, I multiply 0.99 x 2= $1.98 dollars a week.

Multiply that now 1.98 x 52 weeks= $102.96 A YEAR!!

Now multiply this: 102.96 x  10.5 years=

$1,081 and 8 FUCKING CENTS.

So I confronted her about it, and told her since I wasn’t a cheapskate like her, I would accept $800.

But she refused to pay me a cent! Said I was being ridiculous.

Anyways, if I made a GoFundMe for $1,081 to help reimburse a victim of 10 years of child abuse, would you support it?

another few mins later I was cleaning a nearby table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’  and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...yeno...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile  and said 'she likes quickly  and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.


  I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked 'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she says 'have you got a girlfriend?' She said it nicely and politely while pointing at me as she started saying it,  I ignored her, she then asked it  again, then the blonde said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?)  then the brunette asked it again ‘have yet have yet got a gf’   I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit.  The blonde said bye on their way out to me smiling. I wasn't I just felt uneasy, did they like me or mocking me? ",16Feb2019,1
96,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I can’t for the life of me get to the dating stage of a relationship. I’ve never had a real boyfriend, and it’s by choice. Sure I’ve had crushes on people, but it seems that whenever the other person begins to show interest I sort of lose it myself. Or, I sort of idealize the person I’m attracted to, so when I really get to know them I’m disappointed? I can’t even explain the whole thing because it confuses me endlessly.  I’ve thought of a few different explanations. I like being single? I like the chase? I’m really picky? I don’t know,  maybe I’m just not ready for a relationship? I am 16 years old for reference. I’m sure things will sort out, however I still do wonder if maybe I just won’t find someone. ",16Feb2019,1
97,"So I just did the TOEFL IBT exam, and I think I did pretty decent overall but on the toefl speaking part, on the last exercise to be exact, which would be exercise 6, I ended speaking for only 40 seconds, even though they asked for 60 seconds, I had a long akward 20 seconds pause.

Im literally panicking right now, how bad will this affect my grade, I only need a 80 overall",16Feb2019,1
98,"I'm 18, female, and into men. I'm pretty much a total virgin: never gone on a date, never been kissed, and certainly never had sex. This doesn't really bother me because I haven't exactly been looking for love or sex, but it seems to be bothering my subconscious. I can tell because I'm touch starved and I'm kinda self-conscious and lonely and I'm definitely horny.

Before you ask, I do masturbate. But if I go more than once a day (and sometimes even *that's* too much), it's more trouble than it's worth...^(so much rubbing for such a weak orgasm lmao).

Ugh. There are some people I find very attractive, it's insane. But for a lot of reasons, I'm not going to pursue any relationships right now. 

Looking toward college, I could see myself getting into a relationship, but then I start to worry if I'm attractive at all. My face is average, and I'm kind of androgynous. I'm talking short hair, no makeup or dresses to be seen on me, and very disinterested in gender roles and norms. I know there's someone for everyone, but I can't imagine many dudes are attracted to a girl who dresses just like them. 

Plus, even if there *is* a guy for me, who's to say when he'll come? I'd like to meet someone eventually, shit.

I dunno. I might just be sad and horny right now haha.",16Feb2019,6
99,"Come to think of it, a few days back, I had to write critique for a couple of research papers. I got started and got bored after doing the first. So for a change I printed the other one out and to my surprise this seemed way more interesting.

I missed the highlight and notes feature of my pdf reader, so I had to whip out an actual highlighter and pen to do just that. It was a bit more time consuming, but the physical feel of the paper, the ability to actually make notes and refer to them was surreal. It took me back to my school days when books weren't all soft copies and submitting assignments weren't making .docx files and emailing them over the internet. I googled it up, and to no surprises found this &gt;

&gt; It was easier for those who read on paper to remember what they had read. Mangen et al. say that this is because paper gives spatio-temporal markers while you read. Touching paper and turning pages aids the memory, making it easier to remember where you read something. Having to scroll on the computer screen makes remembering more difficult. [Source](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijer.2012.12.002)

I realized how much dependent on screen had I become over the past few years. Sure they are the only way to consume visual media (hell it's 2019 - we're moving to VR now) but something about printed pages is way better. 

And mind you, I'm not yanking about those research papers; my little screen detox experiment extended to newspapers, magazines and a couple nice books over the holidays. It was amazing.

With that being said, I think there have to be other people who enjoy reading from print like me. Even if it means occasionally. What are your thoughts?",16Feb2019,3

103,"Ok so I’m 5’9” 150lbs and my legs have shrunken. I’ve lost about 50-60 lbs in the past 6 months and guess where was the first place to go. My legs then my arms then my stomach. So now I’m a skinny boy with smaller legs ( not as small as they were in hs) but definitely the smallest they have been since I graduated from hs! So the past 4-5 months or so, I’ve been going commando as long as I have jeans on. I don’t like to expose my legs - that’s the only reason. There’s so much freedom in going commando- I feel like a chick haha",16Feb2019,0
104,"I was friends with a couple of these people for years, I even helped one through a really tough bought of depression and always supported her. But I’ve had a rough year and whenever I’d come to her for support she’d listen but it always felt like she was rooting fir me to feel better or actually comforting me. So i felt very alone.

We’ve drifted apart a lot in values and opinions; she enjoys gossip but I hate it and there’s always more but too much to go into detail about.

Basically I cried and talked to her today, and by the end of the discussion where she’d stay defensive the whole time, I realized that maybe this isn’t good anymore. She’s changed, a lot.

So, I need to move on. It’s really hard because this whole time I saw her as my closest friend. Someone who’d always support me. Damn, I was wrong. That stings hard.",16Feb2019,4
106,"I just got an offer letter for a job I thought I was rejected for. This past year had been beyond hard for me and it still is but I am thankful for this bit of good news. I wish I had someone to tell. My boyfriend started ignoring me last week and finally stopped returning to his home a few days ago. I have accepted that it's done but I still feel dead inside. I have nowhere to go so it's a whole mess. I was supposed to get my daughter today but I cancelled as I don't have food in the house. I feel like such a flake and there's just so much happening that I can't change. I don't even have energy to cry. I'd be okay with just not breathing and going to sleep forever.  I can't sleep, either. I'm not sure if this is the right place but I don't have friends and I just needed to tel someone. My life is a fucking mess. I keep trying but it seems like I just have the worse luck. I don't believe in luck but I don't know what to believe. Every time I get something good it crumbles. I hate waking up. I know I'm gonna sink right into darkness and I can't escape it. I want to be excited about this job but I realistically probably can't start it. I don't even know where I'm gonna live. I am gonna try, though. I just needed to vent. If anyone would like to talk I am open to conversation.  I am good at talking to others and I need a friend, today. ",16Feb2019,11
107," I've always struggled with my mental health, all the way from cutting to months of self-isolation when I was a child. I went to a youth mental health service briefly but they didn't help and I was never actually diagnosed with anything, likely because I had just turned twelve.

Despite all this I always had a bit of hope that ""I'll be happier when I'm older"" but I'm almost 16 now, my problems have spanned half a decade and I'm beginning to feel that bit of hope start to fade. My grades are suffering, my friends are leaving (it probably doesn't help that I'm pushing them away) and I've been constantly unable to enjoy anything. I got over my habit of starving myself but I've started developing unsual habits around food, like spending extended periods of time washing my hands before, after and even during meals as well as having this compulsion to separate my food based on colour. I've also been taking painkillers almost constantly for back and head pains that never seem to go away as well as having a constant feeling of nausea.

This is all shit but I think the worst thing is I feel like I'll never get better, when I was younger the age I told myself I would better by was 16. It was always ""you'll have held hands with someone by sixteen"" or ""you'll be able to eat properly by sixteen"" but my sixteenth birthday is getting closer and I don't think I've ever felt worse, my symptoms aren't as objectively bad as cutting but I feel like they're going to follow me forever.

I want to go to a therapist but if I get diagnosed with a mental illness which disqualifies me from some jobs or simply just puts the nail in the coffin of the me that was able to have faith in the future then I don't think I could cope.",16Feb2019,1
109,"Dear me or whoever wants to read my story, 

I am poor, I joke about it to other people in a relatable dark humorous way but I actually am. The reason I am “fit” a.k.a thin is not because I have an eating disorder anymore, or because I am generally an active person, it is because my fridge is empty and whatever meal you see me eating around you is probably my only meal of the day. My father is a broke alcoholic that refuses to work, instead relies on welfare. He makes 17k a year off the government, living in government low income housing in one of the most expensive city in the world. I on the other hand am a full-time student in a prestigious university that I cannot afford, but still attend taking up student loans. I dream to graduate debt free but that seems unrealistic since my bursary application was rejected, despite clearly showing evidence that I am low income. I am writing this like any other morning, waking up, staying in bed for an hour or two to avoid going downstairs, opening the fridge to find literally rotting lettuce, mustard, ketchup, mayo, cilantro, some other stuff; a lot of them expired. I make myself a cup of tea, nibble on bread and go back upstairs. Recently for valentines, my boyfriend got me two boxes of chocolate (he doesn’t know about my situation and I don’t plan on telling him) and little does he know that those chocolates are not craving foods or a snack to pop in and enjoy. Those chocolates have been my breakfast for the past three days. I am so embarrassed to admit anything to him, he doesn’t know how jealous I am that he eats three meals a day, that his parents work and go grocery shopping, that he lives in a nice functioning home that isn’t falling apart, I am so jealous of his life. 

I do work, part time at a minimum wage job, but because of school I can only work two days a week, three days if I am stretching it, and my biweekly paycheck is usually around $250 which adds up to approx. $500 a month. It all goes towards bills and then those once a day meals, or even just some stuff so I can have a social life. Living this broke and poor hurts me. 

My parents are separated but my brother is sick, and my mom is also low income but not as bad as my dad, and all her expenses go to the expensive rent in this city (BTW we live in the suburbs of this city but the entire area is expensive) and taking care of my brother. My dad used to be an engineer, but he quit saying he is disabled even though the government rejected his application and finally said that you are fully capable to work, there is nothing wrong- even the x rays, MRI’s, every doctor note, EVERYTHING proves he is fine, he is just lazy. He is making me suffer, I wish I can save money, but I can’t. He is making himself suffer, just everyone. My little sister doesn’t come my house as much anymore because she told me she always starves, and I feel bad and go out of my budget to buy her food. I am so hurt emotionally and physically. I wish I had some extra money to be independent but for now I’ll pull through.  

Thank you for reading a bit of my life.

Once I snap into that mindset its really hard to snap my self out especially when I'm dealing with another person and the won't respect my wish for them to ease off or leave me alone. I understand self control is very important and I feel like every time this happens I can see how I can avoid such reactions in the future. With that said, I seriously can't stand being pressed and pushed because just like any other person I have my limit and if i respect others to not reach that point I don't know why its so hard for others to do the same. It's not like its out of nowhere that I get angry its always a build up and I keep asking or hinting that I am not in the mood yet I keep getting pressed and when the same reaction happens EVERY TIME, and I'm so sick of feeling bad after.",16Feb2019,2
116,"I'm not sure were else to post this. This has been eating me up inside and now I don't know how to view my ex. 

I got drunk one night. The idea was for us to have sex after. I ended up being sad drunk and just got scared. I started crying and asking him not to hurt me. He went in anyway and finished while I was crying and covering my eyes. 

After I went and cried in the shower. When I came out he asked if I was okay and I said yes. I didn't want to anger him. The next day we broached the topic and decided it was not rape since I never said no. I get that. It's just I remember the fear and the tears, and in context it feels like that should have seen like a no. I don't know if that's self centered. 

It should also be noted that when this happened we were reconciling from his cheating. He was upset with me over that fact that I rubbed it in his face that I slept with someone else while we were broken up and he was with the girl he cheated km me with. He felt I should not have rubbed it in while he was trying to come clean and make things right. While I did mess up here, I feel like what happened went beyond that. 

I'm confused. I don't want to hate him. But I still cannot settle on what happened. I get sudden bursts or rage when I feel like he assulted me, then feel guilty because I did hurt him too and maybe he needed that release.",16Feb2019,4
