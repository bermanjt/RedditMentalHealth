0,"1. Does our political system basically create a situation whereby people who are not morally upright are able to climb to the top more effectively ?  

2. Would you rather be ignorant and happy or have knowledge but be unhappy?   

3. Does capitalism inevitably lead to class warfare?   

4. How is a human being is supposed to give up their dreams when they come face to face with their own inherent limitations?   

5. Would you rather set very high standards for yourself, possibly achieve greater things, but be a total failure because you never explicitly achieve your goals; or set low standards, successfully achieve your goals on a consistent basis, but not achieve very much?  

6. Does achievement matter when we just die after \~70 years?   

7. Do you want to make the world better for people who you will never meet and who may not believe in anything you believe in?  

8. Some people are literally incapable of feeling empathy for other human beings.  Are they at an advantage in a capitalist, democratic society?",30Mar2019,1
1,"And I don't think it's a bad thing, either. For reference, I'm 21 and in college - so obviously in the middle of a crossroads where people tend to ""find themselves"" quite often. But the thing is, I never imagined it would be like this. People say you grow and change in these years, and I know I have quite a bit of growth and change to look forward to, but sometimes I look back on myself from as recently as even a year ago and I'm not sure that me would recognize the person I am today. When I started school here, I was very introverted, quiet, and, frankly, pretty depressed. That on its own took a massive toll on my academic and personal health (including some significant weight gain), but even once I overcame my depression I was still fundamentally the same guy. I never was the type to crave going out to parties or clubs or anything like that, and I was more than content with not going beyond my own small circle of friends. But all that has changed lately. Over the past year I started working out, lost a bunch of weight, took charge of my mental health, and now I just feel... like a different person. I'm so much more outgoing, extroverted, and sociable than I ever was, even before my little run of depression ruined me for a couple years. I'm certainly not complaining; I'm happier now than I've ever been, I'm doing well in school, I'm thriving socially, and yet part of it doesn't feel like ""me"", insofar as in the past I never would've craved a social life like I do now. I can't help but wonder if years of depression and anxiety and social anxiety ""tainted"" my image of myself and now I'm finally discovering who I really was all along, or if I'm just going through some sort of weird phase right now. I don't know. It doesn't bother me, but it does perplex me. Maybe I should make an appointment with my old therapist to touch base and see if these things are common. In the meantime, here's to finding yourself - even when it means not recognizing yourself. ",30Mar2019,1

4,"I spent the first 4 or 5 years out of high school doing anything and everything I could to have fun. This included going to college, touring in a band, and backpacking around the east coast. Like a ton of younger guys, I fell into some awful habits during my first real time away from home and on my own. I started drinking, I started smoking weed, and I started partying harder than I ever had growing up. 

A little background about me; I had a great childhood. My parents were both nice to me. We never worried about money or anything like that, even with 4 kids and only one paycheck. They took care of everything.  We were very normal. My siblings and I were all involved in a ton of extracurriculars, I played varsity sports, my dad coached me in everything and my mom was always there whenever any of us needed her. 

I never struggled in school. I was a smart kid. Not only that, but I was likable. I'm pretty confident that out of a 1400 graduating class, I knew at least 1000 (and was probably known by the other 400). I wasn't necessarily in the ""popular"" clique, but i was constantly invited to bigger things by people more traditionally ""popular"". People liked being around me, I was funny, smart, relatively handsome, and I have a very natural ability to relate to people, something I wouldn't start taking advantage of for years to come. When I went to college, I made friends almost immediately. People like goofy, tall, white guys, who knew? 

I think it was about halfway through my first semester that I started slipping. I started going out later and later, missing more class, and maintaining a certain level of intoxication almost 24hours a day. By the time the semester ended, I had managed to sink my GPA to a 1.8 and was placed on academic probation. Essentially, I had to go to a bogus study group, show proof I was going to class, and raise my GPA or risk being kicked out. I was a smart guy, I just wasn't trying anymore and i knew it. I hid the whole thing from my parents and managed to do everything right to get removed from the list at the end of the year. 

I knew that I couldn't keep it up so I dropped out and went on the road with a band. We played up and down the east coast and did a few runs to the west. It was the most fun I've ever had. I love playing music and I love the night life that goes with it. I went full rockstar for three years. I slept with anything that breathed, I drank anything that would get me drunk, and I did as many drugs as I could get my hands on. After going to my fourth funeral in two months due to ODs, I tried to clean up my life. I slowly cut out hard drugs and slowed down on the booze and pills. I tried going back to school and being a normal college kid. It would work for a few weeks or months at a time, but I would always fall back down some dark hole. I couldn't stay sober. 

I gave up on school and started working in restaurants cooking and bartending. Eventually I found myself in management positions and then was given my own bar. I was able to do anything I wanted, as long as I was making money for the bar.

Spoiler, i was. 

I blew over $2000 a month on drugs. I blew another $1000 on booze. Nobody cares if you're a drunk bartender, you're just another one of the guys. I didn't care because I could stay out until 4am, hang out with people, get piss drunk, and get paid for it. I'd wake up the next afternoon and then go and do it again. I was having fun. 

My girlfriend broke up with me after watching me destroy my body for four years. She put up with so much of my bullshit for so long, but she couldn't take it anymore. I didn't blame her. 

I wanted her back so I quit my job and got a new one working in a much less ""alluring"" environment. Part of the job involves me getting drug tested once a month, so I stopped buying drugs. I have to be at work at an ungodly hour early in the morning, so I stopped getting so drunk I couldn't stand up straight. I cleaned up my whole act and got her back. 

I thought I'd be happier. 

Don't get me wrong. I know that I should be happy. I should be thrilled that I'm the most sober I've been since I was 18. I should be happy that I share a house with a girl who loves me,  with two great dogs, with a cat that hasn't ever tried to murder me, and that I'm able to pay all my bills and not stress about money. 

Why am I not happy? 

Why do I want to go back to a time in my life that I barely remember? A time where I'd wake up with no idea what happened the night before or what was in the empty needle sticking out of my arm. I know that I shouldn't want that. I know that I don't need that. I know that it's not right for me. 

I'm not depressed, but I miss the fun I used to have. I miss the partying and the sex and the drugs. I still get drunk every now and then, but I miss that feeling of blacking out and just not caring anymore. I miss the people. The people who don't care who you are or what you do, they just want to have some fun, just like you. 

I don't really know why I took the time to write all this, originally I think I was just trying to say that I don't have a lot of people I consider friends, when most people I meet seem to really like me. I was just trying to see if there were other people that felt the same way. Clearly I lost control a little, sorry. I guess if you took the time to read this, thanks? I hope it wasn't too rough, I wrote it on my phone, so I'm sure the formatting is shit, sorry. 



TL;DR

5,"Some days really stick out as great days, even with all the stress of whatever we have going on our lives. And today was one of those days for me. I have been hungover all day from drinking last night, and stressed from my exams, stressed from money, from uncertainty about the future regarding applications to other programs and uncertainty about love prospects with a girl. But I spent today with one of my best friends and had a great time doing fucking nothing. The people you can enjoy doing nothing with are your real friends. And I worked on an application to transfer my current program to Iceland which could be a lot of fun, and then I went to sleep around like 5 pm, thinking that even though it's Friday I wasn't going to party because I was too stressed. I woke up at around 10 pm to a friend calling me and insisting that I have to come out and party with them at their place. It's Sweden so alcohol is a bit of a commodity that you can't really buy outside of clubs and bars after 7 pm most days, and I had no alcohol. When I got to the party, my friend gave me a big smile and handed me a bottle of wine. I had great conversations with a bunch of people and got invited to play poker tomorrow.  And I hugged some of my friends who are going back to their country for a few days. Life is good.

12,"TLDR: family broke my fucking heart and it’s time to just disconnect. 

Highly doubt anyone will read this I just needed to let it out. 

My siblings have always been really shitty siblings. I’d look at other families growing up and envy the bonds between them. 

Even to my parents, I’ve always been a problem child, but I was essentially trying to “scream” out “*hey guys, they’re literally torturing me when you’re not looking.*” No one really got the message, they just wondered why I was fucked up. But my parents...they stuck with me through it all. Sort of. When they finally realized what happened to me and it was pretty much too late to erase everything that *fucking burns the back of my eyes and keeps me up at night.* I think that’s when they started to pay attention. 

My dad legitimately is the only one really who gives a fuck about me lately, but I can tell my mom sort of does, except she doesn’t know how to feel about me. I make her uncomfortable. I don’t know why... I can just sense it. 

So, long story short, my siblings molested me and tortured the fuck out of me when I was a kid. They live 700 miles away now... I’ve tried really hard to get away from them, and it was hard, but at least they’re far away now.... went through hell to get away... 

oh hey now they’re rich as fuck with their own families, living the life, not really giving a fuck about anyone but themselves. My brother seems to be having a hard time, but I’m always the last person to know anything. I had to learn about his sons problems through his ex wife. No one tells me anything. 

When my grandpa got cancer, I was the last one to know because someone said something at the dinner table when I went to visit them a couple years ago... I had a really big wtf moment... that’s when I stopped trying. That’s when I really broke. No one cared to fucking tell me my grandpa had cancer. 

I’ve been through fucking hell and back and they can’t even send me a phone call or a “hey I’m sorry.. I saw you’re having a shitty week. Hope you feel better.” 

My sister kinda reached out, but she’s too busy with her perfect life in her perfect mansion she never worked for to really care. All she had to do was open her legs to a multimillionaire. One “oops baby” Then voila. Lol. Then she expects me to send her spoiled kids birthday presents when I can’t even pay my fucking gas bill. 

They are the reason I’m so fucked up and they don’t even care. So I’m cutting them off. I don’t feel sorry for it. 

Oh. And I don’t have friends for similar reasons, so that’s easy. Just push everyone away. Trust no one. 

I don’t fucking feel sorry for it. I don’t feel sorry for a god damn thing. I’m done. I’ll send out another years worth of birthday cards and I’m fucking gone... it’s the only way to keep my sanity. 

Couldn’t imagine getting married because I don’t think anyone would stand beside me in a wedding. Can’t create true bonds with a fucking man even if I tried anymore. It’s hard to be a truly strong woman when you have someone beside you. I know that now. I know now. And I’ll never be able to unburn my fucking eyes.

If a person is depressed, it indicates that the brain is in a state it wasn’t built for. Ultimately I think almost all cases of depression can be reduced to states lacking in connection and meaning.

This is why I love my parents so much, because they're both the person I am, from two whole and separate sources. They see the world with the same eyes as I do. My close bonds with friends didn't need to be forced, we just subconsciously pick up on the things that make us similar. I like that my close friends are the same as me. They're mature people who don't need to stare at their phones to escape the present moment. They have opinions on things that matter, and they have shared perspectives. They understand empathy, community, interconnectedness, and they do their best. I might manifest my ""best performance"" in radically different ways than others, and thats ok. Everyone is just doing their best and trying to do what they think is right. Is it right in my eyes? Maybe not, but think about everyone else living with this blank canvas of a brain and just doing what they think makes sense. Life is a series of problems and everyone has their own to figure out in their own ways.

do what is natural. If you want to speak, speak. Let your actions be expressions of your creative nature and personality. Stepping in front of my natural impulses and changing my behavior because I am worried about what people are around me or how they may view me is a sure way to a bad day. Love your own spirit, be in the moment and pay attention to the world around you. Ponder, but be present. Aim to understand people, empathize with people. See the good in people, see what makes us all similar. The differences are inevitable and thats the variety that you can learn from and grow. 

Do I want to be happy? Be present. Feel the moment. What is it in the moment that I can engage my SELF in. Can I ask questions to learn about something? don't filter what your subconscious desires out of laziness or self-consciousness. Express yourself by acting on the world around you, through voice, listening, or playing. Dont worry about what the next thing is that you can do to grab your attention and distract you. Engage with what is around you. Talk to people, share experiences, tell funny stories, ask questions, give advice, just talk and enable a stream of conversation that brings out the similarities between you and the other person. Feed off each other's human connectedness and love.

32,"....and the pain is a little more tolerable on a daily basis. But I do have to admit that sometimes the memories and pain sneak up on me and it breaks my heart all over again.

My first memory with you in it was when we were living in Hawaii and I was in an inflatable canoe pool. You put dish soap in it because I loved bubbles. I remember the smell of Dawn and remember the soap stinging my eyes. The water was cold and I was sitting there happy and just playing. The weather was warm and sunny. The sun was so bright and I remember feeling happy and loved. My next memory was still in Hawaii and I was outside of our house riding my tricycle and I got off my tricycle and I tripped and hurt my ankle. You ran over like any good mother would and I cried and then I stopped and started riding again. 

My next  memory was not as nice. We were in Michigan and my dad was there . He was holding me. He went to smack you and you ducked and he ended up smacking me. He apologized over and over and you did nothing. You didn’t comfort me, you just walked away. I lived with you for a while and we lived in Cherry Hill Apartments, right across the street from the little airport. We would watch the planes take off and land. Other times we spent at my cousins house a few blocks away. We had fun! I remember going to preschool there and starting to have the life I wanted. I remember our apartment.  The front door was in the living room and there was a balcony with sliding doors. There was a breakfast nook and then a wall with a square hole cut out and there was the kitchen. There was a hallway and straight down was your room and to the left was my room and across from there was the bathroom. You worked at a diner and you would go to school too. You were addicted to college. You wanted to learn as much as you could. You always told me that anyone can take anything from you, but nobody can take your education from you.  On the weekends we would hang out on the farm, and explore nature. We would walk the trails and just talk. At night, there was usually a party and I would have fun being the cute kid running around. All of your friends and friends of the family were happy to see me and I was happy to see them. Running around with my cousins and around the farm. In the morning, grandpa would make me breakfast. He would usually make Eggs and hotdogs and then take me to the gas station to see his friend and I would come back with a bag full of candy. He also had a secret stash at the cabin that only the kids knew about. As I got older and the custody battle was over, and my dad won, you became distant from me. I don’t know if it was too hard for you or just your way of coping. When I became a teenager, I rebelled like a normal teenager and pushed everyone away. I was living with an alcoholic and I didn’t even realize you were one too. You had 2 other kids and I was excited to be a big sister. I had purpose again. I had an escape...I was living in hell in NJ while you were in VA. I begged to be with you and my dad said no way and made it difficult. As a mother, I can understand the frustration. I couldn’t imagine being away from my kids...ever. They are the reason why I get up in the morning, the reason why I breathe and the reason why I strive for a better life and make calculated decisions. 

You had demons....many demons...the biggest was alcohol. You also had some mental health issues that developed because of your childhood. I’m sorry that happened to you. I know and understand how it feels. I wish that you were strong enough to overcome your demons and I wish I understood what was happening so I could have been a better daughter. Maybe if I had told you that it wasn’t your fault that you lost custody and I didn’t blame you, it would have ended differently. Perhaps if I had made the decision to move when I turned 18, I could have helped you out more and you would still be here. 

I see a lot of you in myself and my parenting and my actions. For one, I’ve given my kids the best gift, a childhood. They can have friends and go to the movies and have sleepovers and watch movies with me. I sign them up for activities and let them play in the sand and dirt and run around. We put homework on hold when it is nice out and play. I also see the dark side too. I see how you held all of your pain inside and I do the same. I’ve seen how you are selective with your friends and I am too. Like you, I’d rather cut off a friendship than deal with drama. I don’t drink like you did....I don’t know how it’s even possible that I’m not an alcoholic. Maybe I’m addicted to other things like sacrificing my happiness to make someone else happy. Putting myself last...making sure that everyone else has what they need before I get what I need? Do you know how long it’s been since I’ve had a latte? Not because I can’t get it, but because I’m too busy making sure everyone else is taken care of first. I’m usually up early and up late and during the day, I’m taking care of my wild 2 year old. I’m lucky if I can get a shower before my lazy partner comes home from work. 

I wish you could have met my kids. You would have loved them. I bet, I would be living in VA near you and living a different but better life than the life I live in NNJ. It’s horrible here...I have nothing here for me....I’m not close to my dad since I know the games he plays. I don’t have a lot of friends and I don’t have you. So maybe it’s time I move to a place where I’ll be happy and content. A place where its drama free and warm and sunny...a place where there isn’t a lot of change. I wasn’t cut out as a person to be with you you. I need you. I need my mom. I need your advice and your love and direction. I need to be able to come over and walk in the door and find you baking cookies with my kids. I need the phone calls from you telling me how your friend thinks my one daughter can be a model. I need you to tell me that you spent way too much money but couldn’t resist on the outfits you got for the kids. I need you to bug me for school pictures and tell me that you have leftovers and to come over for dinner. I need to call you and tell you how stupid some of the school rules are and how to get around them. I need to call you and tell you how annoyed I am with my kids and listen to the stories about myself and how I annoyed you and laugh and be reminded that it’s not too bad.

I live with 7 other flat mates one being this guy who has a girlfriend but he’s clearly gay.

I don’t really care about him, he can get annoyingly loud in the kitchen but whatever that’s just dorm life. One thing I have noticed about him is whenever I come up he always comes out of his room or he’s always in the kitchen and has to look who’s coming in. It might sound like I’m paranoid but his window literally faces the outside of the flat so he can see who comes in. I’m assuming he has built a schedule of when I go out shopping and how long it takes me and then whenever I come up for some reason he has to come out of his room to see me. I know this is a stretch but it has occurred one too many times for it not to be a coincidence.

50,"Redditors of the world, allow me to tell you about two special event that used to happen at my school: The Black List and The Red List.

Every year the senior students did these lists as a way to end their school years. I personally didn’t partake in either list and you’ll soon hear why.


**The Black List**

The first one, the Black List, was a day where (most of) the seniors would “punish” those they didn’t like. Maybe a girl is a bit of a bully, maybe a guy is an asshole, there could be many reasons someone is on the black list.

Schools in my country aren’t divided into elementary, middle and high school, the include all grades, from kindergarten to senior year, so they obviously couldn’t punish anyone that was not in “high school”.

Sometimes in anticipation to the day the black list was made, senior students would write the names of the targets on the bathroom mirrors, but no one would know when the black list was going to happen.

So come the day of the black list, senior students and choose to wear masks to avoid punishment from school officials (sometimes, not always), and then comes the chaos. A minute or so after the bell rings for recess to make sure everyone is outside their classrooms, the seniors run towards their targets and throw eggs, flour or dirty water.

Afterwards those who were targeted have the option to leave school if they want (no one wants to be dirty or wet while in school).

I didn’t participate in my black list because 1) I’m way too nice to want to do that to anyone and 2) the only people I would have wanted to do this to were in my own class... but I didn’t... because I’m so nice.


**The Red List**

This one in particular I really didn’t like. The Red List was a day the female senior students would round up the hottest guys in school and take them to a classroom. Let me break it down.

Before the recess the red list would take place in, the girls would prepare the classroom by moving all desks to the edges of the classroom to leave a wide open space in the middle. One student would bring a speaker to play music (usually reggaetón, the cancer of all music). Another would bring red makeup and another a bunch of blindfolds for the boys.

Come recess and five or so girls leave the classroom to go look for the guys. They walk up to one of the boys and ask him “Would you like to be on the red list?”. A guy can say “no”, but if he accepts, the girl blindfolds him and helps him walk back to the classroom.

Once all the boys they want are inside the classroom, they sit them down in the middle of the room and the “fun part” begins. The girls would kiss the boys’ cheeks or necks, write their phone numbers or cute messages on their uniforms, play with their hair, open their buttoned up shirts to touch their chest, etc. All while the guys are blindfolded and don’t know who did what to them.

By the end of it the girls help the boys out of the classroom where they can finally take off their blindfolds and they return to their own classrooms.

This list I really never liked. Maybe it was because of how prudish I was back then, but something about the whole idea seemed a bit wrong, you know?


And that was the two lists my school used to do. I know for a fact other schools did the black list, but I never knew if another one did the red list.",30Mar2019,1

55," 

A few weeks ago, I asked my friend out on a date. She told me she was already seeing someone, and that if I wanted to remain friends with her, I would have to accept she had a boyfriend.

I said okay, but that I needed some time to move on. I always considered her to be *the one* you know, the woman of my dreams. I've been rejected many many times before and I always moved on pretty quickly, but with this girl in particular I couldn't. I just couldn't face the fact that there was no hope and that it wasn't going to work out. It's literally the first time it ever happened to me. Anyways... I needed some time to process the rejection. She said she understood, that I should take all the time I needed and get back to her. 

Wednesday, I texted her, saying that I had finally moved on and that we could be friends again if she wanted.

Thursday, it was the end of the year party. I tried to talk to her, but she was so cold and sometimes she would simply ignore me when I was speaking to her. It made me so upset that I wanted to leave. Unable to find a ride home, I decided to stay and began drinking to forget about the entire situation. I only drink once or twice in a year, for special occasions, and when I do, I get drunk pretty fast. People say I'm a ""happy drunk"" because when I drink too much, I start liking everyone, telling them how great they are and how much I love them. Yesterday was no exception, I started texting people, some friends I had never spoken to in years. I told tell them about how I loved them, how I wanted to catch and everything. The girl I liked was one of these people I drunk texted.

Friday, when I realized everything I had done, I said sorry to everyone I bothered the night and explained what happened. My crush blew off, talking about how I was being disrespectful to her and her boyfriend, for saying I loved her, and that I wasn't respecting her boundaries. I tried to explain she was one of the many many people I said ""I love you"" to last night, and that it didn't mean anything. I was ready to show her all my texts to prove it. That's when she told me to keep my distance for good this time.

I had never been so shaken in my entire life, I swear to god. I was trembling like I had Parkinson's, my fingers were numb, I think I couldn't even hold my phone straight, my vision became blurry, my hearth pounding, a sense of imminent death. I didn't want to loose her, even if she doesn't want to date me, she is still the greatest person I've met all year. I started texting her again and again, trying to explain everything, I was begging for her to listen. She told me not to contact her ever again and blocked me on Facebook.

So I texted her best friend, trying to get help. They always sit together in class and she probably knew everything already. I told her I would die if my friend didn't at least give me a chance to speak. The best friend told me not to joke about death, and I told her I wasn't joking, I was about ready to jump out my window, I've never felt this way before. The best friend asked me if I was home, I said yes. Then, she told me that my crush had forgiven me and that she would talk to me again, I just had to stop telling her I liked her.

A few minutes later, two police cars and an ambulance showed up at my dorm. They were looking for me, someone called the cops saying I was suicidal. I explained the entire story like I did now. They asked if I wanted to talk to the paramedics, which i refused. Then, they suggested  going to the hospital, and I said no again. I'm not suicidal, just really upset. But they didn't believe me, they said they wanted to be sure I wouldn't kill myself in the event the girl still refused to speak. They handcuffed me and put me in the back of their car. They said I was not under arrest but that I was ""apprehended"" until I saw a doctor.

One of the officer said that while they were interrogating me, somebody else called my friend. She told them she did not want to have any kind of relationship with me. platonic or otherwise. She only said she would speak to me again so that I wouldn't kill myself. The police told me that I should not approach her, sit close to her in class, look at her or contact her directly or indirectly or I could be charged with harassment.

They brought me to the hospital where I spent two hours with the cuffs on. I finally saw a doctor and she quickly realized I wasn't suicidal so she let me go.

Today, I'm still shook, just thinking about when she said ""keep your distance for good"" makes me dizzy. Talking about it helps, my friends already told me how bad I messed up. It doesn't matter how many other people I texted that night, from her perspective, it looks really bad. Some say it went way to far and that she overreacted, is she really the perfect woman if she can kick you out of her life so quickly? They try to remind of all the bad stuff she did to me, and still it doesn't matter, I'd do a lot to be able to talk to her again. Of course I will not try to contact her or her friends, I'm not looking to get arrested.",30Mar2019,2
57,"Okay, so this is going to be long so I apologize in advance. Very generic, and vague TL;DR at the bottom. I have one best friend and I want to make sure my point is made clear and the story makes sense so this is going to be a very detailed much needed vent session.

I made a reddit account specifically for this post. I have been a silent lurker with no form of social media for almost a year now and realized this might be a good platform for me to just get this off my chest and possibly get some advice.

I have dated women all my life, never was interested in men, and always knew who and what I wanted out of a relationship. The first man, we will call him… Fabio, that I ever “dated” was my bestfriend of eight years, which is where my issue began. Our relationship was PERFECT in every aspect except for sexually, I am a very sexual person but sex with a man has never really done anything for me, but we did the deed, and I could suffice because I loved my bestfriend. The mistake I made was that I confused the fact that this dude knew me more than I knew myself, for what every good heterosexual relationship must be like. He was my freaking bestfriend, we knew eachother in and out, of course the relationship was “perfect” we basically just stayed besties with the benefit of being able to be romantic and do cute shit together. It wasn’t because he was a man. It wasn’t because I was with the wrong gender all these years. It was because this man is just like my right hand, that I can now hold hands with. UGH! Ultimately this also brought our relationship to an end because there were things that I was okay with him doing as a friend that I was not okay with him doing as a partner and neither of us were willing to compromise because “we met eachother this way”.

Anyway, I met the father of my miracle baby, my BabyDaddy, while still in the confusion of “maybe I should be with a man” mindset. He was the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of Fabio. He was such a nice guy and he was so visibly in love with me. Everywhere we went everyone would tell me they loved the way he looked at me. It was so different to me, and I thought OHMYGOODNESS, maybe I am supposed to be with a man. As our relationship went on, I realized I WAS SOOOOO WRONG. I would find myself always lusting over women at stores, restaurants, at HIS JOB! I would “daydream” of taking a woman out to lunch and kissing their forehead. Oh it was getting bad! It didn’t help that I began to hate BD because he had no idea how to be an adult and he was raised as an entitled spoiled brat and I was always having to do things for him. He would accidentally call me Mom sometimes because that’s what our relationship became. Anyway, we eventually start sleeping apart and basically never talking. One day I decide I am done, I am leaving, I want to be with a woman, I never want to be with a man again, I mistook a relationship with a man who has known me forever as “This is just what it is to be with a man”. My sister however asks me to try one more time. Tell BD I am out the door unless things change and if there isn’t an immediate 180 then I am packing up and leaving. So I do, we have a deep serious talk that ends in the bedroom where we do the deed, which was so evidently forced on my end that after he even said “you didn’t have to do that”. Immediately after he fell asleep I knew it would never happen again and that I was done with this relationship, I was done faking it for a man.

NOW! I have been on high dose birthcontrol since I was like 16 because I have some health issues that cause hormonal imbalances. I was told since I was 16 it would be nearly impossible to have a child because of said health issues plus the birthcontrol I was taking. BUT MY MIRACLE BABY HAD OTHER PLANS! Six weeks after my last night with BD I found out I was 6 weeks pregnant. I was over the moon. I didn’t care at all that I was gonna be a single mama I just fell in love with my little bean. I went through my pregnancy a single woman. Never worried about how my life as just a woman not a mom would be after baby was here. I didn’t care I just wanted my baby. Baby gets here and baby is perfect, BD slowly falls off by himself and keeps his distance after realizing he is unfit.

This is the kicker: Before people go crazy. This is about what I do and do not want to do with me and my daughter okay. I am not judging other women at all. This is what I feel comfortable with. This is where my issue is, this is where I don’t know what to do, this is where I am stuck and scared. As she gets older and I realize I am not just a mom but also a woman, I start thinking about romance and what I want for me and my baby.

I see so many news articles about little girls being hurt by “moms boyfriend” or “step-father”. I know not all men are the same and I am very much an advocate of that, but I would never trust any man alone with my daughter. I also know this happens with women, but statistically it is MUCH LESS likely. However I also feel like dating a woman would cause unnecessary confusion and difficulty for my daughter. I know my family would have something to say about it. They are amazing parents and we have come such a long way since I was younger but they were so “hopeful” for my relationship with BD because he was such a “good man”. I just don’t know what to do. I would totally be okay with it just being me and my miracle baby and a bunch of animals. But I am also a woman, a very romantic woman, I have my own needs and I want a little family, I want marriage, I want my miracle baby to have a little brother or sister (which is now possible for me because thanks to miracle baby I no longer have to have my cervix periodically shortened because giving birth reversed the progression of my cervical cancer). I feel like I would only be happy in all aspects with a woman (of course all relationships have their issues and are work), but may cause some issues with family and confusion for baby and me. But I do not want to be with a man, because I am never really happy and truly do just want to be with a woman and never would be able to leave my daughter alone with any man no matter how good they are… I just don’t know.

Thank you so much for allowing me to rant. Thank you so much for sticking this out with me.

TL;DR truly love women but don’t want to possibly make things harder for me or my daughter by dating a woman, but also cant date a man because I don’t think I can truly be happy with a man.",30Mar2019,4

I'm not really insecure but, I'm concerned. Our examinations just ended and she just stopped texting me. Is it related or she's having second thoughts? I don't know.

63,"All my life I've tried and tried to escape from the country and culture I was born in.

Looking back, I know I made the right choice. It was a vicious country where i endured bullying, school violence, ostracization and hazing over and over again. All done by people that look like me, eat like me and sound like me.

Fuck them. I live in the US now, in a predominantly white town, and Im doing alright.

But something feels missing. I dont belong here either. It just doesn't feel natural. I want to blend in more. To fit into the mainstream. I want to BE them. And I want to purge my past, the language I learned to speak, the cultural cues I picked up to survive in a hostile homeland.

I don't know what to do or what I can do any more. I want to forget and let go, but there is nothing to fill the void that fills right.

I'm not really young anymore. Now that I'm in my 30s. So I know this isn't something I will grow out of.

65,"This is probably a stupid complaint, and I know there’s nothing that can be done about it, but I find it bizarre that we as humans have to be ourselves, otherwise we go nuts or are miserable. As if we’re born with a preset and the universe said “this is who you are whether you like it or not”. What if I don’t like who I am? What if I want to be more into this, not that? What if I wish I were extroverted and not introverted? What if I wish I liked this even though “who I am” doesn’t?

The fact that we can’t adjust our interests/who we are and that we just have to be whoever the universe made us out of control is just frustrating to me.

75,"I've got a call to make, and not a lot of time in which to do it. I've been putting off a conversation that I should have tried to have last week, or all the way back in January or December. I suppose the overwhelming amount of nervousness I'm feeling says something, but fucked if I know what.

So, I got kinda-sorta-but-not-really-fired back at the start of January (restaurants man, no one will use the F-word unless you burn the place down and steal all the cash drawers; they'll just not put you on the schedule). In February, I started at a different restaurant, but it sucked. It's a long commute, and until recently, it was rarely busy, so I started looking for a second job (with the intent that once I found that, I would start looking for a job immediately and then finally quit the crappy restaurant once I got hired elsewhere).

And somewhere in the middle of my job-hunt, someone called my old boss as a reference check, and he offered to bring me back on as a daytime bartender. We had a meeting where we unfortunately didn't have time to discuss *why* I was let go in such a crappy way (we briefly discussed some of the areas where I could improve, but never went into why he didn't feel the need to tell me about them *before* kicking me to the curb so that I could actually work on them). We discussed me coming back this past week on a trial basis, and if I liked it, we could work out a more permanent arrangement. So I did that, and told him at the end that I liked being back and wanted to keep at it. But then he reiterated that he was going to require me to put in two weeks' notice at the other place.

I don't know, I'm making more money here, but I'm pretty sure that there's going to be friction. If I'm a daytime-only bartender, I'm not going to be making the money I need to make, even if I'm working every day of the week. After getting the rug yanked out from under me in January, I don't know that I trust him, and I really don't trust only having one job right now. I have an interview lined up next week, and I'm real nervous if he's going to decide I'm ungrateful because I didn't stop job-hunting once I got his offer and fire me (again) and leave me really in the lurch.

I'm now down to just over an hour to finally gather my courage and call him to discuss these issues before I have to be on the road to my crappy job and decide whether or not to go through with it and give them my two weeks notice. And for some reason, I'm terrified to do so. I've never been in a better position to stand up to him; I literally have a job and have finally applied for my bartender's license so I can apply pretty much anywhere else in the city, but it's just… I don't know… intimidating as all fuck.

I don't know. I don't think I'm looking for advice, as I'll probably be out of time and have to have made some sort of choice\* before I get any replies. I was just hoping that writing this all out would make it easier for me to do what I'm pretty sure I know needs to be done. I don't know if it has…

I want to start with saying that I am not totally sure what is the purpose of this, nevertheless I am writing it because I want to tell  someone the thoughts I am having. 

Today, I made a decision - I am done with being the useless piece of shit I have always bee. You know, I couldn't clear my college entrance for the 2nd time even after wasting 3 years behind it ?
I am done with being like this - none respects me, my opinions don't matter. 

I am obese and the girls I have had crushes on have never reciprocated it ( Not their fault,  it's just that I am more of that nice , good natured and obese friend you all have ) . Its not that I haven't had girlfriends, but I haven't ever been in love with them, so I have always broken up. 

I hate myself, every second I live feels like a torture, like, death will end it . But no, I am not weak. I won't die. 

I have decided to start winning from now. From now on, I will stop crushing, loving - giving my heart , only to be rejected . 
I am going to achieve success - academically, and in every other way. 
(Lol, I think I have read too many of philosophical books , so earlier I thought that - its useless to run behind success ) 

I have always loved computers and coding ,but , I know, my poor grades won't fetch me CS in any good college, so I plan to get enrolled in any engineering course I am eligible for , via my awful grades, and then learn Theoretical Computer science from any online resource and books i can find. 
 
Lol, it's funny that I have often felt like I need to make efforts to date , or else I will end up single , but, now, I will tell myself that all I need to be is the best version of myself and everything will fall in place. 

Wish me luck, dear Internet strangers. ",30Mar2019,2

88,"I love breathing in exhaust fumes. I have sucked countless deep damaging lungfuls of diesel and gasoline exhaust straight from the tailpipe of many trucks and cars.

The only experience I have with a 2 stroke engine is a Husqvarna leaf blower. I did not blow the leaf blower into my mouth although I do admit that this would be pretty cool.

What I did was start the engine of the leaf blower and put my face right up to where the smokey exhaust was blowing out and sucked the toxic pollution deep into my young lungs iver and over and over again.

Then I got a large plastic bag, pushed all the air out of it and made it so there was just a small opening. I put this small opening right over the exhaust valve so that the bag filled up with 100% pure unfiltered 2 stroke engine exhaust.

I could see the thick white smokey exhaust swirling around inside the bag. I exhaled, put the opening over my nose and mouth and sucked the undiluted exhaust deep deep deep into my lungs and held it in for as long as I could. I had to stop after this as I could feel the telltale signs of carbon monoxide poisoning starting to kick in.

With diesel exhaust you can pretty much inhale it for several minutes on end until you are coughing up black soot but with gasoline engines especially 2 stroke you have to be extra careful because the carbon monoxide will get you quick.

Anyway I could literally taste the exhaust soaking into my lungs like motor oil seeping into a pink sponge turning it black.

For months after this I could taste it coming up sometimes after eating a heavy meal or coughing.

The problem with 2 stroke exhaust, or any exhaust really is that it’s hard to selectively fuck your lungs with it because the fuel gets in your blood and effects every organ but once every so often it is so nice to fill my lungs with exhaust fumes. 

It gets me so hard to feel the pollution soaking deep into my lungs as I picture the delicate air sacs of my lungs turning black and withering.

These days however, when I fuck my lungs I am more likely to use clay dust as it appears to fuck your lungs up real nice without as much damage to other organs. Gotta stay alive long enough to watch these lungs deteriorate, break down and die.

You may think I’m trolling and I suppose in the strictest definition of the word I am but the stories I tell you about how I’ve fucked my lungs are true.

If you check out my other posts to Reddit or just search Reddit for clay dust you can find a video of me crushing up a bunch of clay under a blanket and filling my unfortunate lungs with millions of microscopic particles of lung shredding silica.",30Mar2019,1

I met a man there who also enjoyed the game that invited me to join this random message board.  It was called The Dark Cafe.  

Even after what I went through in middle and High School, this was the most diverse group of characters I had ever interacted with.  That message board had everything from hippies to haters, garbage men to scholars.  Spaniards and Portugese, though I'm still not sure of the difference (KEEDING!).

93,"I've been feeling so down lately and my cat Bear being sick is the worst thing that could have happened. It's funny because I was talking to my friend the other day about how our situation can't get any worse and laughing about it and then this happens. Sometimes it feels like the world is out to get me. I'm a positive person, I'm not in a good financial situation but it happens to most people and I know one day I will have a job again and things will be much better but right now knowing that Bear is sick I feel so stuck like I'm frozen in time and all I can do is just cry and hide from the world as pathetic as it sounds. I know it's irresponsible but I can't even focus on applying for jobs anymore these past few days, yesterday I missed an interview for a job that I wanted. I feel so guilty about it but just the thought of it made me sick and anxious, I felt like I couldn't breathe. Stress is definitely getting to me.

I know it will sound ridiculous to most people but Bear is the most important being in my life. I love him to death, he's my family, he's my friend and I know you might think ""it's just a cat"", but it's not just a cat. I found him when I was at my lowest, when I went through shit he was the only thing that put a smile on my face, when I felt lonely I loved to get home from work to him. He can feel when I'm down, he'd come on my lap and purr, I'd put my hand on his paw and he'd put his little warm head on it or in my neck, it's so comforting. Like what would I do if I lost him?

Now he's sick, he's got urinary obstruction and fuck I hate to see him suffer. Just the thought of it make my eyes tear up. The pet insurance is paying for some of the treatment, I've begged my bank advisor to have an overdraft so I can contribute and it's still not enough lol this overdraft will make my situation worse but I honestly don't care at this point. My parents suck and refused to help me to pay for the consultation, I know I'm in my early 20s and I'm an adult but sometimes people need help... but nope, I was helped by someone that was not family to take Bear for an examination. I still swallowed my pride and begged them to just help a little earlier for the treatment but nothing! ""it's your responsibility"". They've paid for my brother's studies and they've paid for his driving lessons and my sister's too but I had to pay for it on my own and they still gave me shit for it ""your brother and sister have got their driving license at 18, what are you doing?"" Yeah except you paid for both of them and it's really expensive.

I dont know why I always shut my mouth with them. I had to save every penny I had and you know what? it's cool. It taught me to get shit for myself and to be hard working and not rely on anyone, I worked for everything I have and I'm proud of it but sometimes, people need help and your family is supposed to help you. I need your help but a 100 euros is too much to give to your youngest daughter? When I've helped them many times when they needed me?(Not financially) They've got money I know that, just 4 months ago they've given my brother 300 something euros for his son's birthday. It hurts more than I thought, I realised it now.

I feel like I've got no energy, I dont eat much anymore, I feel sick, I've got this horrible knot in my stomach since the vet said that Bear is sick. I'm broke, literally broke, barely got any food left for myself, barely made it on time for the last rent I could afford but yeah mom, it's just God testing my faith and I'm in this situation because my faith is weak lol if I killed myself I honestly think she'd still think that. There's literally no way out of this, by the time my application to get some money to help with the treatment is reviewed it'll be too late but yeah, just need to pray right? Haha Fuck off, I honestly wish had a different family. I don't know why my own parents seem to hate me so much, I was always someone shy who stayed out of trouble, at 19 I moved out and worked shit jobs to not be a burden to them, I've got them bday gifts even though they never got me anything past my 18 years old when they still give gifts to my brother and sister lol dunno what I've done to them 🤷‍♀️ I guess I'm just resentful because they could literally solve my problem right now but they won't.

96,"My ex-girlfriend of one year broke up with me a month and a half ago for many reasons, several of which will become clear during this post. Both of us were each other’s first real relationship and first sexual partners. I could never comprehend why she broke up with me and I relentlessly pursued trying to get back together with her. I initially attributed much of the breakup to me leaving for a 3-semester rotation co-op in January 700 miles away from our midwestern university, and distance making things difficult. It’s apparent this was absolutely not the primary motive. I had asked her countless times why she ended it and she would tell me the same completely reasonable things. I would insist on going back and forth with questions where I was never able to comprehend how she felt during the low points of our relationship or come to a point where I knew what to do. I always focused on the great points of our relationship when talking about wanting to get back together and she focused on the low points of our relationship and how they hurt her and how I couldn’t guarantee they wouldn’t happen again. 

To me, it felt like we were perfect together as we had so many similarities. Neither of us had met someone before that we could talk to for so long and never get tired of each other. We talked every single day that we could. We found humor even in tough times. We had similar sexual libido and were of some similar level of sexual awareness and level of activity. We took trips and had fun together and listened to the same music. The problem was whenever we argued or had a low point it would impact her and not me because I was the reason for it. She NEVER wronged me or intentionally did anything to hurt me, and whenever she unintentionally hurt me I would tell her and she listened and made an active effort to fix it. I never doubted her and always trusted her (until we discussed anything relating to my own problems), but she reached a point where she could not do the same for me. We always joked half heartedly how awful my communication skills were but there was a profound amount of truth in that I didn’t know how to respond to things without first thinking things through — this was a major reason as to why I caused as many problems as I did. I always saw all these things as speed bumps in an otherwise perfect relationship and couldn’t realize the overarching problems I kept causing.

As of last night, it seemed like she was pretty convinced we would not get back together but she wanted to remain friends because she cared about me. We discussed it and it felt weird, like we were in some weird limbo state because we were something more than just friends still, emotionally and sexually, but it didn’t feel right to her committing to me again. I’ve had trouble grappling with this because although this was my first real relationship I went in to it thinking no one would love me because of my insecurities and because I had a history of not being emotionally attached to things. I ended up falling madly in love with her and I care about her more than anyone or anything I’ve ever met before. I didn’t want to get over her because I had never been so sure of something in my life, that I wanted to spend my life with her. During our relationship she had reciprocated that she was in love with me, and remained so until we had a fight over me previously flirting with other girls with the intent of gaining some validation from it. She told me I was emotionally cheating and I didn’t believe her. At that point, she fell out of love with me and it went downhill fast from there. I am convinced I will never meet someone as amazing and beautiful, genuine, and relatable as her but I don’t know how to react now that our relationship and friendship will likely never recover from my actions. 

We had Facetimed this morning and prior to the call we were on moderately good terms. She had asked me if I had a crush on anyone during our relationship. I had resisted in responding but I told her I had, as I didn’t think it was a big deal and I told her I loved her and it didn’t matter. She correctly guessed who it was. From that point she made it very apparent I had gaslit her and lied to her and treated her like a piece shit, since I had denied I was pursuing this girl during our relationship. Talking to her made me realize I had been pursuing this girl and while doing this simultaneously I had told myself I wasn’t. I don’t know why but I never thought that I had emotionally cheated on her until she told me. The call ended with her repeatedly calling me a son of a bitch and telling me to go to hell, that she ruined a year of her life being with me, that I was dumb and might even have a mental disability, that I was the worst person she had ever met, and that she hoped I find someone as good as myself. I didn’t know what to say. I’ve never felt so hurt in my life but I can’t even imagine what I have put her through.

I emotionally cheated and never brought myself to realize that I had. I had been in denial the entire time and assumed I was always doing the right thing and never second guessed myself. I can’t believe I allowed myself to cheat on ANYONE, especially the first and only person I have held so near and dear to my heart, ESPECIALLY when I hate cheating. I never wanted to cheat and I knew it wouldn’t benefit me because I had someone so perfect already, and if I were cheated on I would be furious. I don’t understand how I could look down upon something so much and still allow myself to do it and furthermore not realize I am LITERALLY DOING IT MYSELF. Somehow even after all of this I still did it and refused to acknowledge it, and now I am where I am now. I thought I had damaged her ability to trust people but she says that because she has never met someone like me I will have not had any effect on it. I don’t think I can ever ask her for forgiveness. I don’t know how to live with myself for being a cheater. 

I’m not typing this out because I blame her for anything that transpired in the call, because I don’t. I’m typing this because I have neglected and disrespected all my friendships in my life and treated everyone I know like they were of significantly lesser importance than myself and I don’t know what to do now. This goes beyond my ex-girlfriend as I have treated plenty of friends like shit and feel like I’ve never swallowed my pride and acknowledged it or tried to change myself as a result. I have judged my friends harshly for little things they do and made small things reasons why I haven’t pursued friendships, even when I myself am broken. Even then, I can’t start talking to someone without thinking that I am annoying them and wasting their time. I relied on her to tell me the things I was doing wrong because I couldn’t see them myself. She grew tired of having to tell me how I am wrong and having to substantiate everything like I am a baby that can’t tell right from wrong. I blamed all my problems on everything but myself. I was always wrong and she was always right, even when I told her she was wrong. She never asked for this going in to our relationship.

There was a point during the call where she said that I might not be fixable, and there’s a reason no one cares about my life right now. I believe her and I’m scared. I don’t know how I could reach a point in my life where I can’t even understand that something I am doing is so clearly wrong. I don’t have anyone to turn to for help because although I’ve always relied on everyone else to help me with my problems I never fully reciprocated and gained the level of trust I did with my ex until I trashed that.

Where can I start to become someone that isn’t so self absorbed and ignorant to the bad things I’ve done? How do I become someone that can actually recognize I’ve done bad things and take action to stop them from happening again and prevent myself from doing shitty things and hurting people I care about? How do I develop BASIC HUMAN VALUES and respect my friendships and show that I care about people? How do I become self aware? 

TL;DR: My ex broke up with me for reasons I couldn’t accept and I never fully blamed myself. It became apparent to me today that I gaslit her and manipulated her and I couldn’t understand I was doing it and refused to recognize it. Now I’ve lost the person I held closest and I see I have no close friends to talk to because I realize I’ve been an asshole all my life and wouldn’t invest time and effort in to my friends. I don’t know what to do now.",30Mar2019,1
97,"I always fight myself going back and forth on the point of posting this, but maybe it'll be therapeutic?

I was young and naive, confused love, emotional abuse on both sides, sometimes you would even hit me, but maybe that's just what love was? Maybe I deserved it? I did cheat on you after all. You took away my phone, computer and even texted my parents on my behalf from my phone. I had no contact I was alone. You even made me quit my job. ""If you keep going to work, you'll wise up and leave me."" You told me you would leave with our son if I left you. I couldn't do anything but take care of our son, and I even tried letting you go out with your friends, because you seemed pretty depressed too. So at least one of us could be happy right? You would go and do your art thing with them. You'd stay out until 2 am, but I wouldn't mind because our sleep schedule was all sorts of fucked up anyways. So I'd wait, and wait. And then you'd come home and everything would be fine. Then you'd leave the next day.

This continued for months. You would even sit on the front lawn in the car talking to your friend. I'd like to say it didn't bother me, but that's what we did when we first started dating. We would have those intimate conversations in the car because we didn't want to end the date. Is this what this was? No, you were a good person; a better person than me. I was the cheater, I was the one in the wrong, you would never be as horrible as I was.

Then your parents kicked me out. ""Why doesn't he have a job?"" ""He doesn't even want to provide for his own kid.""

It still hurts. Your parents were flawed, very flawed, but I was still seeking their approval.

Then I left, and stayed with my godmother. I just let out the last 3 years of pain and torment, from both yourself and me. My mother said it was like I had been in jail for all this time. It couldn't have been that bad right? 

I immediately go back to my old job, they hire me nearly on the spot. I was excited, I felt hope. But it was strange, like something I wasn't used to. It didn't matter that I didn't have my diploma or GED, I could get a job. You just didn't want me to.

It took a week to get working, during that week I was almost trying to pick up where I left off 3 years ago. I played games, I met up with friends... it felt...fake. Like I wasn't this person anymore. I hated it. Who am I?

\--So far, this does prove to be...nice to get this out...suppose I'll continue.

I made that dreaded phone call to you. It was the break up call, but I tried to use the excuse that I needed to work, and therefore needed to end it so I could work. You immediately called me out for not even trying to make it work. But upon remembering it now...it didn't really seem like you wanted to make amends, you just wanted me to know I was wrong. You weren't fighting for the relationship, you were fighting to prove you're not the one in the wrong.

Luckily you didn't, it made it easier to just blame it on the job and not bring up all the pain the last 3 years have caused both of us.

It ended, and she said I could come to pick up the rest of my stuff. It was pretty surreal, almost like I was about to break the surface. You started talking to me about it again, asking if I was sure this was the end. I said yes, and you told me you'd always be there if I wanted to get back together. I nearly vomited in my mouth.

I decided to go to one of my friends houses because I felt like I needed a drink. 

Within the hour it took me to get to my friends, he decided to look at your facebook and saw that you were already in a new relationship. With the guy that you were going out with all the time. Staying in the front lawn in your car. Always texting. Sleeping over his house.

I should've seen it coming right? But maybe you never cheated but he made it known that he liked you. Like literally every other guy in your life. ""They're my only friends,"" you would tell me, making me have sympathy, even though I hadn't seen my only friends for 3 years.

It still hurt, and I let you know when I picked up our son for the weekend like you said I could. You shut down, because you knew I was right. It was shitty. But there was no overlap. It was just like when you left your ex to get with me. There was no overlap right? Just emotional texts, small dates, and then you break up with them when you have your next person.

Whatever. I had my son and that's all that mattered. I took him to the park with my friend, and then went out to eat with my mom. ""Where is he?"" I texted an innocent picture of him at the restaurant, because hell, he's your son too, and you should be in his life even when I have him right?

You freaked out saying I need to let you know every little thing I do with him, where I take him, who he's around, because he's your son. I say it's a little ridiculous and drop it.

I drop him off and you tear up a bit and we parted ways.

And then you said you couldn't trust me. I couldn't see our son.

Well fuck right? Guess I do have to go get a lawyer, there is no working this out without court.

Hire pretty much the first attorney I find. 5k, down the hole. But I'm getting my son back right?

The attorney convinced me during mediation that it would be best to let you have majority time. And feeling already pretty broken down after not seeing our son for 5 months, I just wanted to see him again, Even for a minute.

So I took every other weekend.

I took 4 days a month. Because I wasn't patient and I let my attorney sway my judgement.

My best friend, who at this point is now my wonderful girlfriend, isn't really happy either. I know I fucked up, she doesn't even need to say it. The fact that I could hardly get my dick up for months said it all. My spirit is broken.

But at least I get to see my son right? I have a wonderful girlfriend who loves and supports me right? Why do I feel so empty?

Your boyfriend tried to fight me with our son in my arms. Maybe that's why you left him?

A few months later I decided to reach out to new attorneys to try and see if I can amend my mistake. All of them charged ridiculous amounts... I didn't have the money.

Luckily a friend came through and found an attorney that works from home for cheap. She's very sympathetic and is willing to work with me to get this fixed.

We filed for a motion for contempt. I had numerous things against you, listing out you not letting me see him for holidays, being unreasonable with our timesharing, not letting me take him to the doctor when you wouldn't. And it looked impressive. I had all this, we'll put you in contempt and then modify the parental agreement and get more time. 50/50, I still recognized you were his mother and didn't want to exclude you the way you did to me.

But then it got pushed back.

and pushed back.

Continuance. And then the judge lets us try to work things out on our own and reconvene later to see what we can't work out.

We can't agree on anything of course.

But it's fine right? We'll go back to court and work it all out before a judge.

April, no court dates available until September. Septemebr rolls around and you don't even show up to the hearing. Judge schedules the hearing for February. February comes around and you email the judge, literally the day before and say you're not ready. And she lets you reschedule. Now the next date is may 23rd. Our son is now 4.

He is not talking, only speaking random phrases.

He is not potty trained.

Luckily he is not on the autism spectrum right? But now there's no excuse for why he's so far behind.

During this time of waiting for the court dates, I took him for evaluations for his speech and occupational therapy. I show them to you, and you blow up saying I'm doing things behind your back. I was, but only because you wouldn't allow it. He obviously needs speech therapy and the occupational therapist equates him to that of a 15 month old.

The judge ordered you be present during these evaluations because you accused me of tampering with them.

We finally get them scheduled and it seemed to finally click for you. Maybe?

You still didn't do anything. You never took action for this. Even though I offered to pay.

Even though I got everything set up for him to receive free therapy from the state, you never took him for the evaluation. I couldn't because I only got him on the weekends and you knew that.

Then I decided to get the autism evaluation done. But you had already canceled the first one. So I held him for 10 days, ensuring you it's just so I can get him the help he needed.

It was emotional...those 10 days. I stayed home from work to be with him and try teaching him words and phrases. And he picked up on it immediately.  So were you just not teaching him? It took 5 days to get his sleeping schedule to be normal. I got teary eyed when I saw his clothes hamper was full. The damn laundry. Why would I cry about the fuckign laundry? Because it was the first time I had seen more than 4 outfits in his hamper. I actually had to do the laundry because it was full. That has never happened because I never had him for more then 3 days at a time.

He's not on the autism spectrum, and little did I know that appointment would be the last time I saw him for, about 5 months so far. That was in november and it's now almost april. 5 months. I haven't seen him in 5 months. AGAIN.

I text you and text you, but you never respond except once that you jsut can't trust me to give him back anymore, so I can't have him. I kept him for 10 days, telling you every detail about what I was doing and when you would get him back. Maybe I was in the wrong, but it was so I could help our child.

Now I don't even know if he'll even recognize me. 

I showed up to your house to try and persuade you to let me see him. You broke down saying that I was being irrational and an asshole because it's my fault your grandma, who has now passed, never got to spend holidays with him. We drove the conversation back to letting me see him. And you said I could have supervised visits with him for a couple hours, but not right now because you had to get to work. Fine, I guess. I get it. You need to work. Then said we could get back to normal once we get to court in february. 

Whatevere right? At least I would get to see our son. I texted you about our converesation to make sure there was a log and asked you when I could see our son.

You responded that I had declined to see him and didn't want to see him.

Right now, it's been 5 months since I've seen our son.

My now wife is 34 weeks pregnant. I don't want to talk to her about this all that much because I know it takes a toll on her as well. But it's so hard to find motivation for anything anymore.

My coworkers tease me whenever they ask how I am and I say ""I'm tired.""

I'm tired. Of everything. I'm worn out, I've been beaten down. But I have to keep going right?

Just keep moving forward it'll get better.

My doctor says I'm depressed. Fuck yeah I'm depressed. But it'll get better once I get to see my son and get more time with him right?

right?

Circumstantial depression, so itll get better once this is over right?

Can it?

I',m starting to doubt it now, but I'll never know until its done.

My wife is pregnant, and I love her so deeply. She is amazing, she's built me back up, watered my roots and nurtured me until I could live on my own. 

But this is still holding me back.

I engage in new hobbies, I learn new things, I excel in my career. But it's all just a distraction. And I realize that now. It's all been a distraction. And It's catching up.

I try new things now, and I can't work up the motivation to keep distracting myself.

Before I dig myself deeper in this hole, don't worry. Suicide isn't an option. I have too much going for me, that even if I need to sacrifice my own sanity, I have to be here and help my future son.

But fuck I'm tired.

This'll get better right?

We'll go back to court when I have a 3 week old and I'll get majority time, get him the help he needs, and he can start school in august on track right?

Is this a hopeful lie? Am I wrong to tell msyelf this? Do I just continue lying tomyself?

What good is optimism if it never works out?

But nope. That's jsut me, optimistic despite all the evidence.

I;m not ignorant with it, but there always a brighter side to itright?

Just have to keep moving forward. It'll get better.

Thank you for letting me vent. It's kinda therapeutic, but I jsut can't wait for this to actually be over.

tl;dr I'm tired ",30Mar2019,2
98,"I'm tired of the alcoholism. 

I'm tired of never being able to get emotional about anything without being told I'm overreacting or being mean. 

I'm tired of feeling like his mother, asking him to help out and pick up after himself. 

I'm tired being pressured for sex and being told I'm mean for not being in the mood. 

Im tired of the passive aggressive comments about not being in the mood. 

I'm tired of being accused of seeing other people.

I'm just really tired and sad. Everytime he says he fucked up and wants to be better I really want to believe him.

 I know this got long but I really just need to vent. ",30Mar2019,3
99,"Today my best friend and I went by our old first job. It shut down. We peeked inside and saw the dingy, deprived interior. I couldn’t express the feeling of sadness and reflection I felt into words in that moment. I’m 17 years old and I feel like I aged 10 years since I left that place. We were hired there at 16 and left there after holding the place up for 6 months. We used to joke around, put our visors backwards, and play basket ball with the wrapping paper there (Subway). Now all we could do was sit there motionless from the outside and look at what used to be our first job. 

In that moment I realized I went through so much in that year. From grinding to buy my first car, moving out of my child hood home, finding my lost self to applying for college and contemplating my future. It’s like I grew up so fast. 

In that moment I also realized that my future is right around the corner. I leave for college in 4 months, and my best friend leaves for the air force after me. It’s like nothing is the same anymore. 

My past has made me into the person that I am today, and I am grateful for that. These hard  experiences have shaped me into the person I need to be for the future. I just hope everything is exactly how I imagined it. I don’t want to miss a thing. ",30Mar2019,1
