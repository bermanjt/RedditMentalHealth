0,"It's been almost a year since I've talk to my mother. I didn't speak to my FIL for about 10 months. The last thing I told him was that I was having thoughts of suicide. It's not a subject that I want to talk to my mother about. 

I've always felt like  I've never rose up to the expectations they had, and years later I still feel this like I let them down and they know it. I dropped of HS, worked full-time for minimum wage. I worked for a manager position at that job and climbed to the level of GM. When I got the promotion I wanted to tell them thinking some weight would be lifted off my shoulders, but they just kept asking me "" how much do make?"" ""why don't you make more?"" 
When I told them about my GM Position they took upon themselves to try and find me another job that would be ""better"" 
Honestly I just wanted them to tell me good job. 
And frankly it fucking hurts.

How do I tell my mother that she makes me think about how my choices are never good enough for her and that makes me want to kill myself?

1,"That stuff is hard.  
 I have hipdysplasia. Which means I have the hips of an elder, eventhough I am about to turn 24 and If I am not careful, things can go downhill really fast. I am on a list for surgery, but that is going to take a long, long time. ""You don't have all of the symptoms, yet!"" they say.   


 I have had people tell me I'm lazy, just because I asked my mom to pick something up from the ground or to put on my socks/shoes on bad days. I am not allowed to do any type of sports (except riding a bike or swimming), so working on my health is a challenge. I do go to the gym once a week, but usually leave after 30 minutes because I am in so much pain. 

As a girl, I like to go shopping with my other girlfriends. But as you might understand by now, I have to take a break every 15 minutes or so. Which makes me feel like I'm a pain in the butt to be around with. A stranger told me once to ""get a grip, because you have young legs!"" after I complained to my friend in how much pain I was. 

Finding a job is difficult as well. Most of the jobs available around me are for picking orders, which means standing 8 hours straight. 

I don't own a wheelchair, but I always rent one when I go to amusement parks. I get weird looks when I suddenly get out of it and start walking. I can walk, you know. Just not the wole park. Also standing in line for 45 minutes is a no go. 

I've never had a boyfriend. I am convinced there's nobody out there willing to take care of me and help me when needed. Of course I tried online dating apps such as Tinder, but without luck. To be honest, I am struggling with being single. If I could get one wish, I'd wish to know when my prince charming will come around. 

People will always look at me with disgusted faces when I don't give up my chair to an elder when on a train/bus. But that's life and I've learned to live with it.  



I’ve posted this on r/offmychest as well, but I wanted to share my story on here anyway.

2,"I guess I’m just making this post instead of texting her this. I miss waking up and falling asleep by her side, her amazing sense of humor, her beautiful smile, her asking me to give her “a rubbin” every night (back rub), kissing her neck, playing with her hair, the noises she would make, our inside jokes, walking into work together, giving her rides to class, the sex, her cat, giving her hugs, talking about how our days were, studying together, her thanking me for making her feel safe, when we would cuddle and she would squeeze me with her legs, going on walks, talking about our future, going to see her family, looking into her beautiful brown eyes, laughing with her, overeating with her, cooking, drinking, and honestly doing everything with her.

3,"I've always thought of it as a personality flaw of mine. Sometimes I find myself just sitting or laying on the ground in silence, just me and my thoughts. I think about the things I should be doing or goals I want to set for myself, but I just sit there. Sometimes for hours without realizing it. I don't feel depressed or anything. I don't know if its ""laziness"", a lack of motivation, or just that my brain gets the best of me sometimes. In fact, I convinced myself to write this post to at least transition from the act of doing nothing by talking about doing nothing.

4,"So I've been on dating apps for a couple of years now, and have met maybe 30 women.  Ever having a lot of trouble turning matches into dates over the middle of last year, I matched with a girl some time last month.  We went on a couple dates right before the holidays, and it seemed like they went well; conversation flowed well and continued on and off over the holidays, and I was feeling confident that I might have met someone I have chemistry with.  Well, after the holidays she let me know that she needed to take some time for herself to figure things out.

After the tough year of dating in 2018, I decided I needed a break.  I disabled the for apps I was using about a month ago. As I approach that 30 days, I'm trying to decide if I really want to enable them again. Before January, I would sometimes spend an entire day laying on the couch swiping, just because come sunset, I would be mad at myself for not having a date or plans. On the other hand, I'm 26 years old and haven't been in a serous relationship since college. I miss having a person to share my life with, and that loneliness compelling me to swipe my days away is still there.

I've seen the girl from before the holidays since then, and I'm hopeful that once she's had time to work on herself we can pick up where we left off. I know, though, that there is a very real chance that won't work out, and that I shouldn't use her as an excuse to stay off the apps.

5,"It's not that I'm overweight or self-conscious about my body, but I'm terrified. I've never been to the gym before, I can't even get myself to go to my apartment's gym. 

I've deeply struggled with anxiety since I was a child, and I'm now almost 25. One of the things I've been diagnosed with is social anxiety. It's not that I'm just shy, but I'm absolutely terrified of social situations. Like sometimes the anxiety gets so bad I puke. It controls my life and has ruined many things for me. I don't want to be this way. 

I was so proud of myself for agreeing to go to the gym. She goes to the gym often and just randomly asked if I wanted to go sometime. Not only am I anxious about going to a gym for the first time, but hanging out with new people also makes me extremely anxious. My stomach hurts just to think about it. I know they say people aren't going to stare and are there only for themselves. I still can't help but to think that I'm going to look stupid somehow. Even if I do everything right. I feel ridiculously embarrassed whenever I'm doing new things. I don't know why I'm like this. 

I'm kind of skinny-fat, so I have a bit of belly fat that I've been trying to lose for awhile. I want to shape up, but I can never get the courage to go. ",04Feb2019,1
6,"was how fortunate my clients who I support are to not have to listen to the mindless drivel masquerading as conversation that my fellow staff members share to aid social lubrication, increasing status, rumour mongering and who knows what the fuck else???

I swear to god, no wonder the neurotypical staff have so many mental health troubles and needless anxieties - they are so petty and produce so much verbal garbage that they aren't even aware of, all with the sole aim of making it through the shift??!! I mean, what sort of way is that to live your working life??? Clock watching in a job that requires you to have compassion, empathy and vigilance on tap? They truly are wasting their lives on multiple levels and oblivious to the opportunity to grow that is staring them in the face.

I must admit, I used to find having social knowledge about people that others wanted to know gave me a fleeting sense of importance and control. \*Shall I let you in on what I know or not? That's up to me...\* But once you realise that the knowledge means jack shit in the overall scheme of the universe and we're all going to die anyway you soon see things how they actually are and quickly realise how privileged a life it is to be catered for 24 hours a day, to be able to reside in one's head replaying fond memories for as long as is necessary, to have my clothes washed and ironed and my meals placed before me three times a day and not be obliged in engage in the pointless, mind-numbing small talk the homogeneous staff wandering around me feel they need to.

7,"My Dad was diagnosed with cancer the summer after my freshman year at a top liberal arts school. I worked my butt off in high school to go to that school. It was a ways away from home though and so once my Dad got sick it was really hard to be so far away. As his disease progressed I transferred to my state school with the intention of spending his last years with him. This was last spring. Just a semester after I enrolled, my Dad passed away unexpectedly.

In high school I had never wanted to go to my state school. It's huge compared to my old school. It has pretty good STEM programs but I'm not in STEM. I'm a psychology major. And the truth is, I don't want to be. I became a Psych major because I could transfer the most credits in that field and therefore I could get out of the state school the quickest. Now I'm a semester away from graduating and I don't know what to do. I'm not happy with my school, my degree and I don't have a lot of extracurriculars because I was taking care of my Dad (not resentful of this, just a fact).

Should I just stick it out this semester and plan on going to a top grad school? I technically have the option of transferring back to my old liberal arts school (I know some faculty there) but it would take me a lot longer to graduate because of stricter transfer credit rules. Would having that school name help me more? 

Regarding my major, I am not super interested in it. I love English and I also am pretty good at math. At one point I had wanted to be an Environmental Engineer. I don't think Psych is for me. But again, it would take a lot of time to switch now considering I'm almost done.

My goal is to have a top job and I want my education to help get me there.

9,"Hi I'm a 28M who has been struggling to maintain relationships lately. I've only been dating since I was 24 and before that, never even kissed a girl, mainly due to shyness I've struggled with my whole life. Fast forward 4 years, I am now a resident doctor and have had sex with 7 women and have been in one real relationship that lasted roughly 4 months. I recently was seeing another girl that lasted about 3 months but she left me because she thought I was only interested in sex when I really wanted a relationship and told her this. I'm just so sick of seeing people on my facebook feed with these beautiful wedding/engagement photos and in real life seeing happy couples and my colleagues engaged or having kids and worrying that I will never have that. I feel the pressure of trying to meet someone while trying to learn how to be a better doctor and working long hours and being under that stress. All of this just makes me feel like there's something wrong with me. I'm not very tall (5'7'') and my hair is thinning out so maybe that's why? Can someone please help me figure this out? Thanks!

I wish I understood this better when I was younger. I still live at home and we still fight from time to time and it always makes me feel like shit after.

I'm at a point where I feel like I need to take a break from relationships. I'm heavily relying on my family and my friends for emotional support but it's difficult to live without someone who you can share deep secrets with.

I've indeed gained a ton of experience but I've had to endure so much pain. Losing someone that close in your life is like losing part of your self. Maybe you can get over the break up but it feels impossible to fill in that void.

Every relationship I've been into looked promising but something always changes near the end that destroys the tie.

After every relationship, I regret not following my gut because my subconscious notices something's wrong very early on but I'm blinded my emotions and sometimes, overly optimistic hope.

I haven’t had the chance to really talk to J since the accident. I’ve reached out and told him that I am thinking about him and love him but I can’t imagine what he must be going through. My loss of B is not nearly close to the feelings that J or C are experiencing. Likely B died in J’s arms. 

The whole event is so tragic. 

Meanwhile C, who introduced J and B, partly (and wrongly) blames himself for B’s death because he introduced the two of them. I went to his house the day of the accident and he was totally devastated.

Those were some decisions which I wasn’t ready to make or understand in a regular time in my life. But those happened during the MA. Anyways, at that particular time, my hidden desire revealed itself again though it was not an electrical this time! It was a toothbrush shaped exactly like the regular ones but battery operated. I wanted to turn my face apart but also didn’t want to pass. It was calling me: come on, you want me! I asked to myself: should I? After a minute of hesitation I lift out the product and paid for it.

41,"My little brother [15] has always been a little different. My parents spoiled him more, he was given anything he asked without having to work for it. He would make my parents feel as though they owed him money for doing mundane things and they would give it to him otherwise he would have fits where he would get mad and scratch the TV or cut cables with scissors, or threaten to kill himself, or blame my mom if cheating on my dad.

He is better since he started going to see a psychiatrist, however I am very worried. He rarely leaves his room, he won’t interact with us. I don’t know if he has any good friends at school, but he is at an edgy phase where he likes to have controversial, terrible opinions that no one in my family agrees with (alt right, slightly racist). He stopped even thinking about a future where he makes a career. He says he doesn’t want to finish high school, and that if my parents kick him out he will kill himself. He is aggressive and calls my mom an idiot, mentally abuses her to the point that she cries, and he has squeezed my dads arm enough to make him bleed. 

I’m in college so I only hear what my family members tell me, but I am very worried. I feel like no matter what we do he has lost respect for my parents. He still respects me and my middle brother, but I’m never there. I wonder if it’s just a phase, I don’t know how to help him. He is going to therapy soon but he has manipulated nutritionists and psychiatrists to make them think he is doing better when I know he isn’t. I am so worried for his future. I love him so much and my family too, but I can barely sleep sometimes. ",04Feb2019,1
42,"Today I went into the grocery story to buy some essentials, recognizing that with the unusual snow we were having that there would probably be less people out, so I decided to take advantage of the situation. 

I just happened to get into the line with the cute checkout guy. His line was the shortest. He made normal conversation with me, but there was just something about him that made me think twice before I left. As I walked outside, I checked my phone only to see that my roommate had texted me and asked me to pick up some pineapple juice. Itching to go back inside and realizing the fortuitous excuse that I had to do so, I swiftly turned around and went back into the store, grabbed the pineapple juice, and jetted back to that same register. 

As he rang up the pineapple juice, I knew that it was now or never. I uttered the first words that came into my mind, “I know this is very forward of me, but I find you attractive.” He smiled, and asked me if he should give me his number, to which I said yes, scrambling for my phone as my hands shook. He then wrote his phone number on my receipt, which I clutched all the way home, smiling like a fool about what I had just done. Never in my life have I done that before. It was exhilarating. 

Yet after I arrived home, put my groceries away, and told my roommate about the wonder that she had led me to, I felt something in me shift. The excitement had tapered off, and I sat at my desk alone, realizing that in doing this it meant that I was really moving on and saying goodbye to my ex. 

I recently went through a tough breakup. I saw it coming— but even for what I expected, I still was not prepared. I knew we’d never work, but I had loved him anyways. He taught me that I could trust people again, and that I could also trust myself. He was not without flaws, however, and did not always treat me like I deserved to be treated. We broke up for a myriad of reasons, and it was hard, but I accepted it. It was never going to work. We were too different in the wrong ways, and at completely different places in our lives. We didn’t understand the gravity of the promises we made each other, and so we had to let them go. 

I felt sad for awhile. I was scared, and thought that maybe I was making a mistake. I felt guilty for being interested in someone else, for I did not want to be unfair to the guy I had just met if I was suddenly feeling like this. I also knew deep down in me that if I ended up liking him, and if he liked me, then that would really be the end. There would be no going back with my ex. Once I move on, I rarely go back. That was very scary for me.  

But then I realized that maybe that was the beauty of it. Saying goodbye, while hard, is sometimes necessary. And whether it works out with this new person or not, I will have learned something. 

With that, I am accepting where I am, and I am going to try to not be so scared. I am taking a risk, and maybe the end result will be wonderful, or maybe it won’t be— who knows? I am excited, I am scared, but I am ready. 

And even if he changes his mind and never texts me back, at least I know that I am capable of being bold, and of picking up the pieces. ",04Feb2019,1

47,"I found my father through Facebook when I was 18. We did a DNA test for proof and it came back a match and we’ve now been trying to establish a relationship these last couple of years. He already has a family and had no idea about me. (My mother is an addict who I don’t have contact with, had a one night stand and never told him) It’s not all happy families as his family resent the fact he has another daughter and want nothing to do with me - which is completely fine. What isn’t fine is that they try to make him have no contact with me and he has to lie every time he sees me so they don’t find out. My dad on the other hand still tries to see me and catch up with me every so often so it’s all good from my point of view. 
Anyway what I’m asking, as gifts for family is a whole new topic for me, is what is a nice gift I get him for his birthday?

Yeah you heard it right same book with different ending for different owner. To make our book valuable we will make it hard to buy like the buyer will first have to fill a fork on our website and then he will get a mail of weather whether he is selected to buy the book or not. Our book will have a very luxurious packaging and will have a certificate in it which will ensure it being the only version out of 100. High class people will want to buy it as the will know that 100 people do have the same book but no one of them have the same ending as i have the idea seems anticipating.

For some that might be the case, and I for sure know that many mental problems are actually derived from chemical unbalances and solved via intake of medicine to get them leveled... But depression is a little too different and to wide in variety to assume anything is true.

Is true that depression causes chemical unbalances, but this unbalances do not necessarily cause depression.

If you eat unhealthy, if you lack certain vitamins and components in your body it's possible for you to develop a depressed state, but being poor, unemployed, with debt, being in a difficult or abusive environment, among many other things, are not chemical unbalances.

I’m a 21 year old male. My whole life has been very sheltered. In my upbringing, I never went out much and I didn’t hang out with friends. All my life, I have suffered with Social Anxiety. Being out in public and interacting with other people has always made me nervous. This fear has pretty much held me back my entire life. It has held me back from making friends, getting a job, learning how to drive, etc. My Social Anxiety was not that bad during my childhood, but it skyrocketed during my adolescence when I was 14. My adolescence was by far the worst years of my life.

I’m always worried about what other people think, I have a fear of being judged by others, I struggle making eye contact, making small talk, ending a conversation, I don’t like being watched or observed, I want everyone to like me, etc. Everytime I step outside of my house and into the outside world I get nervous and I feel vulnerable. My social skills and self-esteem are very poor.

I’m sick and tired of living in fear. I am sick of having low self-confidence. I am 21 years old and I still live with my parents. I do nothing but sit in the house all day on my laptop because it is my comfort zone. I hardly ever go out and I have no friends. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life living like this. 

I’m only 21. I’m still very young. I’ll never be 21 again. These are supposed to be the best years of my life, and I’m wasting it. I’m trying to gather the courage to step outside of my comfort zone and apply for my first job. However, that fear of “What if?” is intense. I know getting a job, I’m going to have to interact with people, I’m going to have a responsibility to fulfill, etc. I have a fear of failure. I’ve been putting off getting a job for the longest because of fear. However, I can’t keep wasting time.

I want to start being a functional member of society. I want to have friends, I want to learn how to drive, I want to just go out and feel free without being nervous and caring about what other people think. I feel like I have a lot to offer, I just need to get past this awful fear.

Any advice on how I can start taking the steps to break out of my box will be appreciated.

92,"So just as a bit of context, I (at the time)  recently quit my job and started searching for a new one. I dropped my CV on multiple places and I was expecting a call for an interview from at least one of them. 

One day I had a missed call from an unknown number (I was in the middle of something) and thought how stupid I was for not having my phone with me at all times because I really needed the job. I don't think much else of it though and just move on with my life. Two days later after an exam, as I'm having a coffee  with my uni friends, I get a call from the same number. Hoping it's for a job I answer right away. It went something like this:

Me: Hello?  
Person:Hello is this (my name)?

Me:Yes, who is this?  
JW:I'm (his name) and I belong to (this) Jehovah's witness organization. It seems you, or someone who knows you dropped your number and data to our HQ at (the address). I am (the grand priest or whatever they have), and I just wanted to check if this is (my name) who lives at (my address).

At this point I am very confused because I was never a religious person, and add the fact that JWs are loathed here and I was basically  taught not to interact with them as long as I remember, less so enter one of their sects.

Me: Excuse me, who gave you my number and my other info?  
JW: We usually check whenever someone gives us info in case something like this happens. If you didn't leave the info, then someone who know you, did. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you who delivered your info because it is anonymously delivered to our HQ in the mailbox. Still, may I interest you in our teachings?  


At this point I'm stunned because this is basically invasion of my privacy and whoever did this is the biggest asshole on earth. I try to distance myself away from it by politely declining his offers and ending the conversation ASAP. He apologizes and says goodbye. After that, I tell this to some of my closer friends and assure me that nothing will happen and that I'm just being trolled. I reluctantly accept this and leave it be. 

FF a couple of days and in my mailbox I get a magazine and some pamphlets. Quick look at them and it's promotional stuff from JW. At this point I'm raging and I call the head JW. I tell him to basically fuck off and threaten to call the police. He tries to dodge by saying he has nothing to do with it, but I can tell that he's lying. 

&amp;#x200B;

About 3 weeks later I get a knock on the door. As I open the door I'm met with the classic line : Do you have time for JC...?  
This was the last straw so I call the police and explain the situation. After giving the number of head JW I get a call back from the officer and he says that I won't be bothered anymore, but my peace was short lived. This was about a 2 months ago and I'm still getting pamphlets and occassional visits from JW. The police says they can't do much since they can't prove I'm being harrassed by the same person and neither can I. I'm thinking about moving but am currently unable due to my financial situation. What do I do?  


P.S. Sorry for the broken English, as it's not my original language. Also maybe this would be better for askreddit or advice but I felt like this was more of a story in itself.

I opened my windows and put on happy music because seeing that reminded me to surround myself with good things. We're not close and I don't think we ever will be, but that's okay. I have an exam in an hour that I've barely studied for. I have three exams this week. Yesterday was my boyfriend and I's one year anniversary. I hope we stay together forever. I help out in a lab at my school and hope to one day be a physicist at NASA, but I don't think I'd deserve a place there.  I started weightlifting because I'd rather gain muscle than lose weight, and I keep convincing myself that the tummy I've developed during my depression is actually something else. I get sick to my stomach when I see how I look in dresses and afterwards put on tiny shorts and big bulky hoodies so I don't have to see how tight my clothes are. Sometimes I slip up and eat food that's not good for me, when I'm down and want to feel better. But then I feel worse. I have a better relationship with my parents than I used to but I still look at it pessimistically. I am a pessimist about things but I don't want to be. I push myself to be more confident when I feel good but when I'm down I think that people can see right through it. I wish I was tough and strong so people respected me. I don't take criticism well and I'm very sensitive. When I was twelve I was mature for my age, but I haven't really progressed since then. I'm lazy and back down from challenges to hide in my room. I write in a food blog when I'm feeling well but haven't finished any of my posts yet. I'm afraid of it failing. Some people are made of goodness and light and stronger stuff than I am, and I am trying to be like them but they're so far ahead of me that I get discouraged. One of my close friends has officially decided that he beat depression, and keeps telling me to go to counseling. Perhaps it is what I need. I can't see through this fog.

101,"This is like comparing ""xxxtentation"" or whoever to Martin Luther King. There is a clear difference between legitimate and intelligent people of the past and the people who can gain large amounts of support in contemporary America. 

The differences between Hitler and Trump are endless, look at the amazingly long list of things that Hitler managed to accomplish compared to this list of next to nothing that Trump has accomplished. Regardless of whether or not you defend Hitler's actions, you cannot deny the fact that he accomplished tons of things. This is like comparing a retarded child to Hitler, because they both become vocally angry and yell a lot, when that is hardly any grounds to claim similarities. 

Stop comparing Hitler to Trump unless you're going to say ""Xxxtentation was basically the Martin Luther King of our era, and he clearly needs a federal holiday in his honor."" Trump is a mentally retarded child, and even allowing his supporters to think that they are anywhere near as legitimate or dignified as the Nazis is fucking disgusting. White people are dead, they died with Hitler, don't let these abominations claim to be anything close to Nazis unless you're going to support the equivalent arguments of ""Morbid Obesity is beautiful"", ""Autism is intelligence"", ""Homeopathic medicine is the best medicine"", ""MLM schemes are real work"", and the countless other defamatory arguments that get thrown around. 


Go claim Jim Jones is Jesus Christ incarnate if you're going to make ridiculous comparisons like that. It's fucking insulting. No, i'm not a Neo-Nazi, it's just ridiculous that you compare one of the most powerful and imposing men in history to a childish asshat whose only valuable skill is appealing to other equally childish asshats. You're flattering the fuck out of Trump, and that should be the last thing you want to do. Sure Hitler was ""evil"", but that doesn't mean he was a childish shithead, there is a clear fucking difference right there, and comparing Trump to one of the most influential people in history does nothing but prop up Trump exactly how he wants to be propped up. He wants to think of himself as that great and influential, and by comparing him to Hitler, you're only giving him what he wants.

102,"Alright here's the story, there's a creek that separates land, we own half and dads family own the other half. Before he died a guy came in and logged on both properties. Illegally on his brothers side. Now let's fast forward to now, now I've been to jail and court and I'm familiar with what the judge looks like. I glance outside and I see a truck pull in, I was thinking maybe my friend got a new car cool. A few seconds later I see 4 cop cars pull in and then a Chevy Tahoe. Now my life just flashed before me. I was thinking of what crime I have recently and I haven't committed any. I walk outside and I see 4 cops and I shit you not, the circuit court Judge just chilling on my driveway. Now I glance to the Tahoe and about 8 people get out. I ask a cop who are these people and he says the jury. Now I'm in fight or flight mode. I assumed I was goin to jail so was about to take off sprinting. So altogether there's a judge, jury and 4 cops just casually chilling in my driveway. I go up to my uncle and ask what's going on and he says the judge and jury are there to look at the illegally logged land. I was like thank the good lord above. I have never ever in my life been so scared. Satan himself could have knocked on my door and I'd be less scared. I've been to. Jail and the judge that sentenced me is in my driveway. I hop in my buddy's car and go to the doc and my blood pressure was 200/90 and heart rate was 205. I told my doc the story and she was rolling in the floor laughing and she understood but she made me stay there and relax before I could leave. I can't stress enough how absolutely terrified of the unspeakable horrors im front of me. I told my doc I saw my life flash in front of me.

104,"So this story happened last summer. I was at my local mall waiting for a friend to arrive. After sending a few texts to him, he told me he was running late. So, I walked over to a nearby seat on a bench and sat down. For the next few minutes, I was just browsing the internet on my phone. Then, I saw someone out of the corner of my eye sit right next to me. Obviously I didn’t take much mind to it because the bench was empty except for me so, I didn’t mind. Then, the person who sat down greeted me. Me, being the polite person I was raised to be, greeted him back. This person reminded me a lot of the actor Bryan Brown, so we’ll call the dude Bryan. So, after greeting him, he introduced me to his wife and son, who were sitting right next to him. I vaguely remember the son giving me a look to get out of the situation. I really wish I had known what would be happening for the next several minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

“Ma’am, what is your view on the afterlife?” Bryan asked me. I know, it’s a weird question to ask someone you never talked to before that moment. I responded anyway,

“I just believe their could be one, but I am not entirely sure.” 

“Are you atheist?” He asked. So, a little info here, I’m Jewish and I honestly prefer keeping my religion to myself around strangers. It’s not because of all the persecution Judaism has gotten in the past. I just don’t want to seem like I am making a big deal out of it. Bryan nodded and then started talking about how Heaven and Hell exist. He even made a compared my uncertainty of an afterlife to someone not being sure if gravity exists and then jumping off of a building. Needless to say, I was getting uncomfortable. Not because Bryan was talking to me about religion, in fact, I didn’t mind that. I was actually getting uncomfortable because I was and still am a minor. I’m actually a teenager but, I still was getting uncomfortable. Bryan was probably in his 50s, talking about religion to me, someone he never met before and not legally allowed to drive.

&amp;#x200B;

Several minutes went by and I was praying that my friend would finally arrive so I could leave. Yet the conversation was being dragged on by Bryan. He kept asking questions like whether I had lied to my parents before, ever called anyone rude, gossiped, that sort of stuff. Then, he asked me whether I had ever had sexual thoughts about other people before. Alarms in my head went into overdrive obviously. I was almost ready to bolt out of the mall but, since I hate standing up for myself and my friend was supposed to be here, I kept put. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, nothing like that happened for the rest of the time Bryan talked. Then, just as he started to wrap up, he gave me his church’s business card and a little paper tract. As he and his family left, I looked at the little tract. The title had “This Was Your Life” in all capital letters and as I flipped to the back, I saw a little logo reading “Chick Publications.” For those who don’t know, Chick Publications is well, a publication company that makes little tracts talking about religion and other stuff. Though, some of the topics can be controversial and a bit weird. They can go into anti-homosexuality but also they go into how witchcraft is evil and Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a gateway to Satan. Few minutes later, my friend finally arrived and I immediately showed him the tract. We had a few laughs and had a pretty fun day at the mall. But, I feel like it’s important to say that I didn’t think Bryan was a bad person, he just did some actions that weren’t to my liking but I believe he had good intentions.

105,"This is going to be such a crazy cat lady post. 

So about 2 week ago, my co-worker/friend dropped off her cat with me because she was going on a trip. I was originally only supposed to watch him for about 5 days, but after she came back, she decided that she was too busy and left him with me for another 5 days. 

He is a bicolor Ragdoll and is super sweet and well-behaved. He would come when called and cuddle with us. My own cat (who is very pretty but is much less affectionate and social) stopped hissing at him after a few days, they started to chase each other around and interact. 

Last weekend, after a total of 10 days, she finally came to pick him up. His carrier looks like a small duffle-bag (not like a crate) and I just felt so sad to see him stuffed in there. 

What a weird feeling... because he was going home with his owner. But I just felt like he had a better time at my place. He got wet food every day, he had another kitty friend, and he had more place to explore and run. He also got a LOT of attention from us.

My co-worker/friend lives in a one-bedroom apartment and also has two big Samoyeds, so it's much more cramped. The dogs don't really play with the cat either. I also feel like 90% of her focus is on the dogs. The hair on the cat's back is very greasy (and has been for months) but she hasn't washed him. She also never clips his nails. 

Basically, I feel like her cat deserves better. I actually cried after she picked up him (in a very small cramped duffle-bag like carrier). She also told me he's been kind of sad/quiet after he got back. 

I just can't believe she wasn't in a rush to pick him up. After her trip, she said she was too busy, but I live literally 10 min away from the office. And she also goes home at 5 pm, so how busy could she be?! I joked that she should just give him to me, but she said no. 

I WANT TO STEAL HIM BACK!!

107,"Lately I have been getting this wakeup call about my weight. Before the 2017-2018 school year, I just had an average weight. I wasn't significantly oversized like I am now. I would say I started gaining a lot of weight around 8-months ago.

I used to take for granted how skinny I used to be, but now I recently took a picture and I am pretty fat right now. Here is a [recent image](https://imgur.com/tLiHjrk) of me with my face censored. Compare that with an [older image](https://imgur.com/opw4Ngj) from the summer of 2017, and you can't even recognize my body. I know people tend to gain weight during the winter, but it is almost spring and I gained way too much weight in the past several months.

I can't even comtemplate this. You have no idea how much I want to be skinny again. I would do anything. I have been thinking about this for the past week and my dream only reinforced my thoughts on wanting to look slim again. I demoralizes me. It hurts me. It makes me want to cry. Being fat is not fun.

I hope one day my dreams literally come true and I will look like that again. Slim and not super fat.",04Feb2019,1
