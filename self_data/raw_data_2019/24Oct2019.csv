Dropped out of school at 15 due to mental health issues and began getting treatment but at the same time began going out drinking and taking drugs. I've been clean as of last year. 

I struggle a lot with sleep pattern inversion. Where I'm asleep for most of the day and awake all through the night until the sun comes up. These nights can be very lonely. I feel like I'm separated from society, it's like I'm awake while whole world is asleep and I'm unable to interact with anything. 

I feel so far behind when I compare myself to other people I know, and I feel deeply ashamed of myself. I have friends but I feel like I'm less than them, and don't understand how they could like me. I'm very ashamed of showing my face in public and rarely leave the house and whenever I see someone I know I get very bad anxiety about what they think of me.

I turn 21 next month and I'll be meeting up with a lot of family that I havnt seen for a while, I'm dreading the moment when I'm asked what I've been doing with my life and the shielded disappointed they feel when I tell them that I havnt really been doing anything.",24Oct2019,1

12,"So a little background story, when I was maybe eight or nine, (five/four years ago. I'm 13 now), my sister, who was two years older than me, showed me a bunch of creepy and paranormal things like videos, stories, images, ect. and it scared the absolute shit out of me. I cried several nights after recalling the stories and images vividly. After that, I went through an extreme paranoia phase that lasted for about a year and a half or so.


I was paranoid of almost everything in the house but mostly the more open spaces and hallways. I was terrified of someone demonic standing downstairs in my dad's office which he always left the light off to and the door open. I would fear that that person/thing would come running after me and chase me through the house until I knew I was safe. So I ran.


I recently moved my bedroom to the downstairs room which is also on the same hallway as my dad's office, the one I was paranoid of specifically.


Everything was fine for the first few months when we were still in the process of moving things over. My parents had bigger focuses around the house due to a baby on the way so they did not work on my room for a long duration of time.


We rearranged my room about a week ago and moved my bed over parallel to the wall it was against previously. Nothing much. I was certain that I would love the way I had been planning my room to look for the past few months. However, when I got it the way I wanted it, I disliked it and I still do for unknown causes.


 The night that I was going to sleep in the bed for the first time since it had been moved, I was walking through that hall and upstairs when I, out of the blue, had this feeling of extreme paranoia again. Very familiar feeling but it threw me off guard. Again, I was terrified of that girl standing in the doorway of my dad's dark office. I bolted up the stairs in fear and worry like I used to. I stopped in the kitchen and hastily looked behind me, confused. I had not felt that feeling in years.


That night, I slept with a light in the hallway on as well as a small light in my room, which is something that I NEVER do. I can't sleep with lights on.


The past few days I've felt wary of my room and the hallway and I'm seriously considering moving my bed back to where it was originally.


I am just very confused as to why this would happen again and what would cause it. Any advice or ideas as to why this would happen is greatly appreciated.


TL;DR- I had a paranoid phase as a child but came out of it a few years ago. I haven't been extremely paranoid for those few years until I recently rearranged my bedroom. I don't understand why that would trigger my paranoia again. ",24Oct2019,1

15,"TLDR; I don't grow enamel on my teeth because of an illness I got as a toddler and so my teeth breakdown easily. Finally got proper health care and now my dental health is improving greatly!

From the title I know it seems as though this isn't a very big deal and it may make me look as though I don't brush my teeth (which WAS true).

When I was a small child, I got a very strange sickness that unfortunately caused my teeth to not produce enamel on there own. Due to the fantastic, wonderful, and stupendous American healthcare system, it's been a struggle to get help for my teeth. When I was 8 I ended up having 7 cavities and at 15 I had an entire crown put in because my tooth was on the brink of shattering. When I was around 19 I took a massive interest in finally trying to take care of myself properly and that's apparently where I went wrong. The more I brushed my teeth, the worse my cavities would get. Cleaning them left them exposed to new bacteria to further deteriorate my teeth. FINALLY, after receiving proper healthcare I've finally got a prescription toothpaste that's gentle on my gums and has ACTUALLY been protecting my teeth. It feels awesome to brush and not find a massive amount of blood in my spit.",24Oct2019,17
16,"I'm currently a student at a big party university, already a few years in. I came as a way to challenge my anxiety and try to change my personality to one that I thought would be more extroverted and likable.

Boy was that a mistake

I did manage to get a grip on my anxiety, but not because I forced myself into parties that I got bored of 15 minutes in. I did it through therapy and organizing my thoughts.

All anyone does here is party, there are no other social groups. I don't hate parties, but they're not really my thing. I never could have imagined how isolating that would feel. If you don't party, you CAN'T make friends or have casual conversations or relate to the people around you. Even the people who I can consider friends only really see half of me because I don't party with them every weekend. You miss out on jokes, relationships, study groups, everything.

I know things will get better, and I've already made huge strides in coping with my depression and schoolwork. Plus I genuinely love my program. I just wish I could see more people like me, that I wouldn't have to constantly bend my personality just to stay afloat in a conversation.

If any of you are trying to choose what to do after high school, choose what's best for you, not what will make you what you want to be. Cause what you want to be in high school may not be what you want to be in a few years.",24Oct2019,2
17,"I may look like anyone else you would pass by on the street. I may even smile if we happen to make eye contact. 


However, if I was transparent, you would find what sits inside this thin shell of normality is a cosmos of chaotic emotions. Emotions with no reason and purpose. I feel suffocated and debilitated with them ballooning inside me.

Luckily we had each other, then I got so dependent on her that I started falling for someone who's not entirely her. The emotionally unavailable wreck. Then she said she's not into dating atm and she wants to get over her bad time.


Fast forward to 10 months, she's enjoying life, travelling, playing games, has good friends and always hang out. Me on the other hand is doing good too. I have friends here, travelling and life seems much better.

As I sat down last night listening to a playlist made up Skyrim, Final Fantasy IV, and other videogames I have played; I realized that my life's purpose is to delegitimize the life coaching industry. I made an explainer video.  The reason is that I am a licensed marriage and family therapist and I have been told I have autism and ADHD.  I know that those labels mean nothing to me and they are simply one person's interpretation of my self-expression. I know that people who have been given those labels often all struggle with similar things.  They struggle with feeling connected, being consistent, and most of all loving themselves.

Life Coaches exploit this.  I see it on Reddit in all of the forums I visit.  There is some vulture with no training, no ethics, and no framework on how to help people offering carrots so they can beat you with the stick.  Life Coaches know how to elicit shame in other people and they exploit this by eliciting shame in their initial coaching sessions and charge money to take it away.  There are bad therapists and you can report them.  How do you report someone who just declared that they were something?

That is when I took of the mantel of Professional Troll.  I a Licensed Professional Troll. I want to troll the life coaching industry into oblivion one video, one post, and one person at a time.",24Oct2019,3

I am not suicidal, I just think about it. But I’ve always had self esteem issues, and this year there’s not a lot of people I can talk to about them. Usually it’s just that I put a lot of weight into people’s opinions of me, but when it’s bad I get into the habit of thinking I’m worthless or subhuman. I’m in an abusive relationship and the only reason I can think of why I’m still in it is that I don’t care enough about myself to leave. Maybe.

30,"Due to recent stressors in my life, I decided to try meditating for once.

I put on my most comfortable pajamas,  put on a meditating music playlist, I sat crossed legged on the center of my bed, and I dimmed my lights.

I sat there with my eyes close, back straight. I listened to myself breathe through my nose slowly into my diaphragm, and listened to myself breathe out slowly through my mouth until my diaphragm was fully contracted. I tried to stop every racing thought that came through my mind.

I did this for a few minutes until I started I started having a vision...a daydream...I don't know what to call it. But I saw me, third person view, sitting crossed legged in the center of my bed. My eyes were closed, my hands on my knees. Then something approached me. It looked like a silhouette of me. It didn't have a solid form. It was made up of what looked like dust and stars, galaxies I suppose? The silhouette was very faint.

The silhouette reached out to me who was sitting in the center of the bed still meditating.  I watched it put its hand on my cheek in a caressing fashion. It just stared at me.

As I was watching this happen, it was then that I started to realize some things about myself:  The most important relationships in my life have been nothing but pain. Every relationship from family to friendships to romantic have been nothing but hurtful. It is all I've known. Because of this, I am basically a lonely person. However, I came to realize during this vision that the last person that needs to hurt me anymore is myself. I am the last person I know that can show me any compassion and yet I choose to be hard on myself because I have this ingrained belief that I'm not worth experiencing happiness. Then it all came together: the silhouette that reached out to me was my soul. It was the part of me that believes I am worth something. It was the part of me that understood that I am suffering deeply inside and knows that I don't deserve the pain I was feeling. It was the part of me that loves who I am despite what I've gone through. It was the part of me that believes I can be strong and keep moving. It was the part of me I would never get in touch with because I didn't know it existed. Or perhaps, didn't want to believe existed.

During this vision and realization, I started crying. While meditating. I didn't stop for a few more minutes because I think I was finally starting to confront what I had worked so hard to keep running away from.

It was truly a beautiful yet scary experience. I left my meditation session feeling a sort of relief and awe due to my profound discovery. I ask myself, what does this mean from here on out? I guess the only way for me to find out is to keep meditating.",24Oct2019,1
31," So I am well aware this ""guy crushes on girl who is unavailable"" trope is as old as time itself, but here I am stuck in it, like some bad sitcom, and the only way I can bring myself to talk about it is anonymously through a website. I don't really know what I'm expecting to get out of this, but I suspect just the act of typing out what I feel might allow me to get out of my own head, even just for a moment, and right now that is all I want.

Some background about what kind of person I am:

I am an average community college student who (by what I assume to be complete dumb luck) landed a fairly prestigious and highly career-advancing internship during the current fall semester. As a person, I generally keep to myself, and work as hard as I can to keep myself occupied and out of trouble. I routinely stay after-hours at the office to finish any outstanding tasks, I sometimes go into work on my days off to help out, and I pride myself on being told I'm the ""go-to"" intern in the office. Outwardly, I put great effort into always keeping my composure in front of my co-workers, and from what I hear from my coworkers, I always seem focused and ""stoic"", and thus not particularly approachable/social. When I am not at work, I am in class or at the gym, or I binge-watch old movies as a pastime. I admittedly do not have much of a social life, partially because my very small circle of close friends all attend college out of state, and partially because I have some difficultly advancing into any social relationship (whether in work/school) beyond ""friendly acquaintance"" without having had known someone for many years. That said, I do not consider myself socially awkward and can hold a surface-level conversation with a stranger with ease and even exhibit some charisma, but what I am getting at is that I (and seemingly those around me) consider myself a ""consummate professional"" type of person. I've been this way for a long time, since early high school at least, and as such have never been involved in any romantic relationship, though this doesn't really bother me all too much. All this information isn't necessarily relevant, but I think it may help knowing how I look at myself when I explain the situation.

I met this girl during first-day orientation as she was assigned a desk next to me. I found her very physically attractive and was admittedly kind of happy to begin with to have her nearby, but I am no stranger to suppressing feelings of attraction and was determined to not allow it to affect my work. I initially desired a purely professional relationship, but as the days turned into weeks, I gradually uncovered more and more of her personality as we inevitably talked throughout the workday, and I found myself growing more and more fond of her presence, not only because I enjoyed her physical appearance, but also because I genuinely enjoyed her company. We'd talk about future plans, our personal histories and opinions about workplace topics, and in time we eventually ventured into personal topics I usually refused to discuss, such as thoughts on marriage, parenthood, and relationships. At this point I was fine of thinking of her as closer-than-usual friend, but I quickly realized I harbored stronger feelings than that when she first mentioned her existing long-term relationship to me after about a month of knowing each other. To my surprise, I was caught off-guard by this revelation and was much more emotionally impacted than I felt I should have been. I rarely if ever drink, but that night I went home and drank myself blackout drunk to dull these feelings I experienced, and missed work the next day. It was clear to me at this point I clearly felt something more than friendship for this girl, whether I wanted to admit it or not, but now that the possibility of pursuing some sort of relationship with her was off-the-table I had lost control of my emotions.

Since then, I have been maintaining the facade of business as usual as well as I can. I have no reason to believe her relationship will end anytime soon (though she never speaks about her boyfriend much to me, and frankly I do not feel malevolent enough to wish the end of what I assume to be a happy relationship for her) and so I am attempting to move past my feelings and simply keep a work relationship with her until the end of the internship, but I have an awful time of keeping my emotions in check. Where I would leave work after a long conversation with her in an excellent and highly-motivated mood, I now leave with deep sorrow after every workday, and my thoughts constantly drift to her during my non-work activities, be it school, or the gym, or even as I sleep. I would try to reduce contact as much as possible to make things easier on myself, but this is an impossibility, and now I am simultaneously waiting in anticipation of and dreading the fast-approaching end date of our internship. I know the healthy thing is to move on, and continue forward with my life, but I also can't stand the thought of losing touch with this trusted friend of mine and woman who I am for whatever reason so attached to. I hate not being able to control or compartmentalize how melancholy this makes me, and I feel as if I have lost control over some key part of myself as these emotions disrupt my life. For the first time in a long while, I am in a predicament where I cannot see even the slightest hint of a desirable solution to. I do not know what to do.

I don't know what else to say from here. I don't really expect anything from anyone who reads this, nor do I even know *if* anyone will read this, but maybe I'll get lucky and someone will share something that will help me get my head on straight once more.",24Oct2019,1
32,"I come from a Mexican household and therefore have extremely strict parents. I recently got accepted for an internship that is based in California which is only a state away from me also, I will be living with my grandma during my internship. Last year I had applied for the same internship and when I got accepted my parents told me I couldn't go because I wasn't ready to leave but everybody in my immediate family said my mom shut me down because they rely on me to babysit my siblings and help around the house. And when I told them I was going to apply again and leave without their permission my mom became hysterical and started yelling and threatening me with anything she could. So now I am 21 and was once again accepted for the same internship and accepted the offer and paid all my fees. I leave in two months but I am finding it hard to figure out how or when to let my parents know I'm leaving with or without their permission. I'll only be gone for 8 months and it's for something that will further my career. I am a good kid I don't party or drink or ever go out, just school and work, I've never disobeyed them in my life and I fear when I leave my mom will not talk to me anymore.

She would never ask them for more than they wanted to give. And in the end they all thought they could have better and so they peeled her off their skin and moved along, with only a few glances back. 

You’ll never know how she tried. How she loved completely, intensely, honestly. How she mustered up hope over and over again, even though the pain got so much worse with each fresh disappointment. She did not become the shadow you see, scurrying home to hide, without a fight. 

But some fights have to have losers. Happiness would not exist without a basis for comparison.",24Oct2019,2

41,"I never understood why we decided that cereal, eggs, toast, oatmeal, and other shit was ""breakfast"" food.  

The **word** '**breakfast**' originated in the mid 15th Century. It was derived from the verb 'break' and the noun 'fast'. When one ate on awaking in the morning this was an act of breaking the fast which occurred during the period of many hours of sleep. -Quora

43,"I feel as if though we have already passed the golden age of streaming. We used to have the dual Netflix mail/streaming package back when they did that what must have been 10 years ago now. I was back in high school... things were easier then.

My parents would only use the mail service and I had set up the streaming on my PS3. At that time, the streaming selection was absurd. They just kept adding stuff to it every month. You didn't have to look for something to watch. It wasn't like when you are looking for food in your fridge at 2 AM where you eventually settle on something. It was just chock full of blockbusters and you never had to search for something for very long (they also used to have a much better categorization system which I think they have deliberately made worse to hide the fact that they have been consistently losing streaming rights).

Alas, a perfect system like this won't last long because somewhere down the line someone will realize they can make bigger $$$ by selling it themselves. Now we have Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, the new Disney streaming platform and I think there are a few others who are planning to or who have already started one. And each of these services will run you up like $10. Now you can't get it all for that much, now you have to pay $10*10 if you want everything. So you are basically paying for cable all over again. We had such a beautiful system and now we are basically back where we started, albeit with more convenience.

Sometimes, I fear that the same things are going to happen to other things on the internet. Its only so long before they can't profit off of the no-adblocker-users anymore. I don't look forward to whatever convoluted system they are going to employ to make it harder to view websites without being barraged by spam and nonsense. They've already ruined a bunch of things on Youtube (like their mobile app) and I really don't look forward to whatever ridiculous systems they are going to tack onto everything else.

I genuinely want to support hardworking content-creators, journalists, artists and such, and I do this whenever I can. But I just can't help but feel that most of the profits from these services are going to people who are already exceedingly wealthy.",24Oct2019,2
44,"My brother died.
Do you know where I'm at?
Because I can't know.
To know would be to acknowledge...
How could I be so heartless?...
To snuff that out and admit ultimate defeat.
To let him die.

I keep thinking of negative words in a positive way.
Catastrophic. Visceral. Anger. Fire.
These words will forever be a definition of an indescribable effigy to everything I wanted to do ""a little later"".
My brother was a constant hand through this fog I put around my normally clear vision. 
A hand that flipped me off and grabbed me.
Saying: ""you can't stop""
Rather yelling: ""why would you stop?""

Because he was confused by inaction.
Stagnation was the same as impotence.

It was supposed to be us.
Him and me.
Standing on the edge of some cliff.
Literal or figurative it made no difference.
Laughing. Always laughing.
Because to laugh in the face of fear is freedom.
To free yourself of inhibitions was his motif. 

I always felt at home when we were together.
Completely at peace and at the same time terrified.
He made me feel invincible. He brought out the best in me.
I hope he felt the same.

I suppose there's no real way to know anymore.
I can ask his friends, and hug his girlfriend. But I'll never truly know.
And that's okay. Because what really matters is what I believe to be true.
And I believe my brother also felt whole when we were together.
I believe he felt alive.
I believe he felt challenged, and motivated, and catapulted, and loved.
I believe he felt immortal and terrified.
As I did.
As I do.
Because I will carry his torch.
It will not touch the ground on my watch.
He will march with me until the end of the path like we always knew we would.

You're free. Free at last my brother.
Run. Charge. Fly.
Like your physical body never could.
I'll miss this forever, or however long I last. Whichever comes second.

49,"It's been four years (almost five) since I've broken up with her. 

The first time I saw her (X) was when she walked into my class in high school. The very moment I saw her I was just awestruck by how beautiful she looked. I couldn't admit that to anyone so I played it cool. My friend (S) had the same reaction but he was much more open about his interest in her. At the time I was courting another girl (A) that I liked so I disregarded (X). 

As time went by I became friends with her and her friends also became my friends. (S) began expressing to her that he was into (X) but she wasn't really interested in him. She turned him down quite coldly I'd say. Around this same time, my situation with (A) imploded after she turned down my advances. 

I was quite devastated because I had had a crush on (A) for a while. I wallowed and I went to (X) to vent my frustration. We grew closer and I hung out with her and her friends frequently trying to get away from (A). The more time I spent with (X) the more I started to see her charm beyond her apparent beauty. She was funny and smart but also guarded and secretive. She disliked ""girly"" things and was what I would say stone hearted. I on the other hand, was always empathetic and very sensitive towards people. 

Before I realized, I had fallen in love with her. I pushed to get even closer to her and she began to see that I genuinely liked her and she slowly let me get past the stone walls that protected her heart. We soon spent every waking moment dedicated to each other. We spent hours on the phone talking to each other about literally anything. Flirting continuously. 

The flirting soon climaxed and I decided to make a move on her. One day as we were messing around, I hinted that I wanted to kiss her. She dared me to do it. There wasn't even a moments hesitation from me as I kissed her. She was shocked because I actually did it. We laughed and kept kissing. Things had become official between us now.

The honeymoon period we had was pure bliss, aside from the fact that we had to hide our relationship from everyone and everything because of her strict parents. This led to a few awkward moments where we had to pretend we weren't into each other. This made me a bit upset but I knew this was a necessary compromise. At first we agreed to keep it secret from the whole world at her behest but she couldn't resist telling her friends and soon everyone that knew us knew we were dating.

Things went well until we couldn't spend enough time with each other due to scheduling conflicts at school and such. I started to see her less and less at school. It became very difficult to spend time with each others. She also got very busy with her work because of an upcoming exam so we didn't even text that much. I should have given her her space but instead I became very insecure and jealous. 

I felt as if she was going out with other guys or having fun without me. I started to feel less important to her for some reason and I was under the impression that she was going to leave me for someone more handsome or wealthy. She started going out with her friends regularly too and I felt sidelined because I couldn't go out with her cuz her parents wouldn't allow it and she wasn't willing to lie to her parents. I became extremely jealous and petty. 

I started to take it out on her. I started to treat her poorly and I ignored her even when she was putting effort into the relationship. Things got really out of hand and we started fighting at every single moment. Every phone call ended with us fighting. Every text was ignored or given an underwhelming answer. We were both angry at each other but we never said it out loud. Soon the texting and the calling we're all but non-existent and we only briefly spoke to each other before we had to leave. 

The last straw came when I heard she went out bowling with a bunch of her friends right after her exams. We hadn't spoken for days and hadn't seen each other for even more days. When I found out I just felt unwanted. The things I was falsely insecure about had come to reality and I was shattered. I went on a bender that day and came home late. I laid on my bed not knowing what to do. It was then I decided that I was just gonna break up with her. I sent her a spiteful text. It was stupid and cowardly of me to have broken up through text. 

The moment I sent it, I regretted it. I did not want her out of my life completely but I told myself not to be so spineless and to stand by my decision. I got a reply back from her which just broke my heart further and wanted to recant everything. I just kept telling myself to stand by my decision. 

I saw her two days later but I just ignored her because I was too prideful. Days went by and the more they went by, the lonelier I became. The days turned to weeks and the weeks turned to months. I had now become a hollow husk of regret. I missed her severely.

Soon I found out that she was attending and event that I was as well. At that moment I decide that I would try my best to win her back there. The event came and I apologized and all and I felt I had won her back. This was a grave misunderstanding. She wanted nothing to do with me and I realized how angry she looked only after someone pointed it out to me.

I texted her the next day asking to clear up where we stood with each other. She didn't reply until later that night. We had a long conversation where I begged for her to come back. She said that I wasn't the person she thought I was. She said that I had changed. She never specified how or what had changed. I felt confused. She ruled out ever getting back together and I died inside. I cried that night. 

For years I've been trying to get over this and get over her but I just can't. Every year that goes by I feel that I've completely relinquished myself from this pain but every year I just lie to myself. 

I've tried dating other girls to forget about her as well but I just keep seeing her face when I look at them. I also can't seem to take any other girl seriously because I've yet to see someone as beautiful as her. Even the pornstars I like are ones that look like (X). 

I constantly see dreams where me and (X) are happily together, sometimes married, sometimes dating. Her thoughts torment me ever day. 

I don't know what to do about this. Whenever I've tried to speak to someone about this all they ever tell me to do is to just forget about. They laugh at me for not forgetting her already. 

I might be still in love with her after all these years. This year, I even sent her an encrypted letter telling her to meet me at a mutual location this Christmas. I don't know if I'll actually see her.

51,"At the very start of this year I decided to pick up an old hobby, reading. With a little challenge of 12 books a year. Thusfar I read a few books, but I don't know what to read next. I've got 5 books waiting for me.

To begin with LOTR. I've finished the The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, but after that I read a few other books, because it took me a lot a time and I didn't want to stick in it all the time.

The second book I want to read is (perhaps a bit childish) Star Wars: The Original Trilogy. I love the movies and with Episode IX coming, it might be a great way to keep up the hype.

The other three books are all classics: The Count of Monte Cristo (Alexandre Dumas), On the Road (Jack Kerouac) and The Grapes of Wrath (John Steinbeck).

55,"So its 330 am.  I'm one of the thousands affected by the ""Public Safety Power Shutoffs"" that have begun to plague California.  I also have sleep apnea, so typically I use a cpap machine to aid my sleep.  

Fortunately for me, it's just a minor nuisance. I'll pass out eventually and while it wont be great sleep, I'll sleep nonetheless. Even more lucky for me, this time it doesn't seem like power to the cell towers was cut, unlike a few weeks ago.

But I cant help but feel awful for those who require more important and possibly life sustaining equipment that are forced to get through this mess.  Its abhorrent. The fact that PG&amp;E neglected its infrastructure to the point that this is necessary should be criminal. Even more horrid is that PG&amp;E has said that it will take up to 10 *years* before they repair/replace enough of its infrastructure to make these power shut offs a thing of the past.  

This is the 2nd shutoff my county has endured just this month, and already a rumor of a 3rd next week.  

My kids have already missed more days of school to these stupid shut offs this year than they did last year for snow days.  Businesses are closed, workers missing shifts, local economies being harmed, all because PG&amp;E would rather line the pockets of their executives than trim trees next to transmission lines.  

They claim these shut offs are to prevent things like last year's tragic Paradise fire.  And yes I can understand that logic, but the fact remains that both that tragic fire and these shut offs were caused by PG&amp;E's willful negligence of its infrastructure. 

I hope a serious investigation is made into PG&amp;E.  At what point do the executives of PG&amp;E get held accountable for what can at this point only be considered criminal negligence? *PEOPLE HAVE DIED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE NEGLECT OF PG&amp;E'S INFRASTRUCTURE.*  No amount of fines by the CPUC is going to set them straight.  *Their exec's need to be facing actual criminal charges and jail time if found their neglect is responsible.",24Oct2019,12

58,"If you believe you are a victim and you stay in that role, it doesn’t help you or anyone else. Normalize the things you have done and reasons why you did them. You’re not a victim, you are a human being trying to live with what you believe is best for yourself. And what’s best for your highest good will not be what other people is best for them. 

If you keep adapting yourself to the opinions of others you will ALWAYS allow yourself to stay victimized. If you can get away from people pleasing, seeking acceptance and begin to see that everything within your being is love then you will no longer victimize yourself. 

That’s where the acceptance is found. 

If you constantly stay in this mindset that “society, friends, family don’t accept me, therefore I am not a good person. I can’t be loved, I am not worthy of love” then you will always find yourself in this state of self rejection, self victimization.

I said that people will never sacrifice their comforts in life to deal with climate change, and if they do they will complain to get better living conditions, man I love slacktivism. He disagreed and said that the movement was necessary to do something about climate change. I said that the action was directed to the wrong people because if it is directed towards politicians, and no clear proposition is put forward then the movement is useless because the politicians can get away without doing anything. I said that one thing to do would be going after the  100 companies who produce 70% of greenhouse gas emissions, and pressuring politicians to make reforms to different sectors of their countries economy to put pressure on them. Then my other brother chimes in and said that in countries like the U.S companies are legally obligated to make their investors and themselves money. That's when I got both of them, I explained that the movement is a changing maze that nothing can be done about climate change except maybe a few small reforms by governments that will do next to nothing, and that corporations who are responsible for most of the destruction for the environment are legally protected so therefore nothing can be done. It pissed them off, they said I was cynical and the conversation went on to another topic. One of my brothers asked ""do you consider yourself phony?"" I said ""to some degree since I don't want people to understand my self-interests and motivations since they can use it against me."".

So I guess I’ll just list some of the stuff he likes, if there’s anything you can relate to tell me what you would want.

-he just got a boat, it’s tiny. But it works. He already has one of those fish radar things. He’s very excited about it, but I can’t seem to think of anything boat related.

-he really enjoyed poker and blackjack, we already have our own table and chips and cards. 

-He’s into some anime, like naruto and that one with racing, something to do with the akina speed stars. 

-He’s been working on an mr2 but has already bought everything for it. 

-he really enjoys rocket league, just Xbox in general. 

I guess my issue is, is that everytime he wants something/makes it known he wants something he just goes and gets it for himself, our last anniversary I had literally bought him a $300 flat screen tv that Walmart was having a sale on because he really wanted a big tv.

67,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I work in a job that is making me depressed. The job pays well, but I'm completely unfulfilled and it's not going anywhere.

I currently work in an events and marketing role for a large tourist destination in the uk. I work in a very small team of three people, and I am the youngest in the office by twenty years. Please forgive any ambiguity as I don’t want to give too much away about myself.  
 

Prior to the job, I was ready to fully dedicate myself to pursuing my dream while working a simple, full time service job that I wouldn’t have to fully commit myself to beyond doing the job and doing it to a standard. I had just handed in my notice to my previous job, and had landed the service job that I was looking for. However, I applied to my current job on a whim, and about a month later out of the blue I had received an offer.  
 

What attracted me to the role, first and foremost, was the money. I am currently earning around £1500 a month, which is a pretty decent income. I’m trying to save up as much as possible, but I struggle with patience and impulse, things that I am trying to work on. The work appealed as I felt it could better financially support my aims, which it would do.  
 

However, I am completely unfulfilled within my role and it is making me depressed. At one point at the start of the job, I was experiencing serious physical stress. I am not an actively angry person, but this job was making me feel incredibly volatile and reactive whereas now I feel as though I’ve just submitted to the stress. At first I believed I was having imposter syndrome, and then I decided I had simply expected far too much of my job, whereas now I believe that neither myself nor my colleagues have any idea what I’m doing here.  
 

There have been several cases where I have been assigned a task, and then it has been completed by a colleague without any communication. If I had been doing my job wrong, I’d at least have anticipated feedback. After a few cases of this, I voiced my concerns to my management, and their feedback was that I was doing too much. This is fine, it means I was expecting or taking on far more than was actually being asked of me. This does leave me feeling pretty confused and unsure of myself however, as the standard of some of the work we’re doing is really quite shit and just not up to an industry level. Even then, I just feel spoilt for complaining. Even then, a lot of the jobs they’re asking me to take care of, they’re capable of doing themselves and it feels as though they’re asking me to do these things just to keep myself busy, which leads me to ask; is it a lack of initiative on my half? I’d agree, because my heart isn’t in this job for one thing, but after having achieved so little in the time I’ve been here and without my colleagues really engaging with me or my position, there’s nothing prompting me to have any sort of initiative. There’s been no receipt of my skills or experience either, so I’ve no fuckin idea what I’m doing here really.  
 

To add; my employment background is in events and marketing, and I’ve done about 10% of the Events work and 0 of the Marketing since I arrived. When I asked my manager for access to our social media, she responded with ‘Why?’. The message I receive from that is that I’m just not meant to. I’m working on a marketing campaign now with an outside company, but I’m afraid the moment I pitch it to my Manager it will just be shot down because it’s not hers. My point being, I was hired to do a job that no one is wanting or expecting me to do?

There’s a lot of conflict in my upset. I did come into this job thinking great, this is going to be a cool new challenge and I’m very grateful to have an exciting and engaging job to pay the bills while I carry on with the rest of my life, but here I am, right where I was before I started the job with just a few more pennies.  
 

No one knows what I’m doing here, and nor do I.  
 

The only thing keeping me here are my financial goals. I want to get out of my overdraft, I want to save up, I need to get a new mac and a couple other bits of gear, but also I have rent and bills to pay. My current motivation is to just show up, get whatever work out of the way that day, and then get out, with the aim of saving up and leaving this job in April or June. However, I’m honestly one part impatient and one part fed up, and I’m struggling to find the strength to just carry on with this job. I don’t want to get any more involved or attached, but that is difficult to do in a job with this level of commitment. I also worry about being fired or let go from the job as a result of me ‘checking out’ like I’m communicating to you now in this post. I’m not going to find a job that pays this well for a long time, but money is hardly the core motivation and being concerned about pay is what landed me in this position in the first place.  
 

I’m upset by how upset I am over this job. Does that make sense?  


What's worse is my self esteem has just fucking plummeted. I feel like I look terrible, I feel like I've let myself go, like I'm old and ashy. My self worth is currently at 0.  
 

What do you make of my position? Am I being a coward for not quitting, or am I being spoilt for not staying? What right do I have to be feeling the way I feel? I’m finding it difficult to make a decisive action, because I’m afraid it could be the wrong one. I simply don’t feel like I can actually make this work- am I just being scared to try?  
 

Has anyone else ever been in a similar position to me? How did you feel?",24Oct2019,2

I don't know what happened afterwards, because we were told to go explore the city while the tour guide was sorting stuff out. Turns out he could've lost his job over my police call because the people that rammed us may have had some political connections.",24Oct2019,1
69," So I posted in relationship advice, and people think I am lying and making this up, please think w.e you want, but if can give me advice. I have no reason to lie or post I just want to get advice.

I want to start off saying that I absolutely can tell the difference between my bf and his brother. If you know twins and have one in your family or you date one, then after a while its very easy to tell the apart. But I admit at first it was hard to. But we been together for a year now, so its definitely easy to.

So last night we invited his brother and his new gf over, and we watched tv, we drank, and we smoked. We were having a good time. I got pretty drunk and tired, and laid on the floor to sleep. They kept going for maybe 30 mins before it quieted down. I heard his brother go to the back to the other bedroom to sleep and my bf was snoring beside me.

Well it was like in the middle of the night I got up because I wanted water, and it was dark, and when I went back to lay down with my bf on the floor, his back was to me, so I put my arm around him, and tbh I was horny, so I started to play with him. I put my hand on him and was making him hard. I heard him whisper are you sure? So I kept going... he rolled over and pushed me on my tummy, and got on top of me and was whispering how hot I was. And we had sex.

I fell asleep and woke up before him in the morning. When I looked over it was my brother's twin!!! I was freaking out inside, I didn't say anything, I got up and hurried to our bedroom and my bf was in the bed!! So I didn't say anything, I got in and he woke up and kissed me and I was just saying I was really tired. Well he got up and went to work.

His brother didn't say anything to us this morning, because his gf was still here, and he hugged me and missed my forhead and left. So I am here. WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE??? I am like omfg at my mistake right now!!!",24Oct2019,0

71,"I was dealing with depression for a while due to a certain medical diagnosis I recieved. My only two friends never checked in on me, never cared what I had to say and made me feel worse about it when I tried having a conversation about our one-sided friendship. I didn't want pity, but I did want to talk about it, with someone who understood me. It made me think, really long and hard about my ""friends"", how I never felt valued or cared about. I thought, ""Maybe I'm just burdening them."" But I wasn't. I rarely talked about myself, I never got the chance, because it was always about them. This went on for about a year. I had multiple breakdowns because when I needed one of my friends, they were never there for me. This alone made me want to die, it made me feel so lonely and broken. I didn't feel important, which worsened my depression. I spiraled.

Over the course of time, I slowly had some realizations. These two people that I have known for 10+ years, only wanted me to help them with their problems, not vice versa. How did I stay in these friendships so long? I asked myself. So, I began speaking to them less. I stopped helping them with their problems. You know what happened? My mental health improved. I no longer felt like a burden, or that no one cared about me. Do those feelings come up every now and then? Yep, but only when I think about those two friends, my *only two friends,* who should have gave a damn. 

I'm getting better slowly, but surely. I'm losing the weight I gained when I was at my worst, I'm going to the gym and most days, I feel worth something. I have motivation to clean, cook and take my dog for a walk.

If you are depressed and feel lonely, look at those around you. Because they may not be helping you in the way you need the most. I'm done being a people pleaser, I'm done putting in effort when others won't. One-sided friendships/relationships can hurt your mental health a lot. Take care of yourself.",24Oct2019,1

So I’m 18, and have not really had any good experiences in my life, I’ve been feeling depressed for the past 2-3 years, and tonight was one of my closest friends birthdays. So I decided for their sake to be the best that I could be.

And I ended up hooking up with someone, and it was one of the best feelings ever, after all this time being sad, thinking I wasn’t good enough, thinking I wasn’t attractive and thinking all about how I hate myself. 

Someone decided to kiss me, they kissed me for me, for the first time in a long time I didn’t worry about how I looked or what was going on, it was just me and her in the moment. I had never had been kissed before so didn’t really know how to react, and yes I was a terrible kisser, she told me that, but she kept on kissing me (I also have braces so that might affect it).

76,"I don’t know where the line is, I’m not a very organized person at all, but I always had this thing of needing stuff to match or look good aesthetically. 

Which makes me ridiculously picky for certain things, 

When I was younger I used to spend my time on tumblr just like most teens then, but the only thing that drove me there was the act of strategically arranging images that look good together (usually by color *and* whatever style it is), I’ve had some popular blogs of different styles because of that need I had. 

I just like it when things look good. Now that I am older I am feeling more self conscious about it.

For example I started oil painting (and using someone else’s old brushes and other materials at first), but I already selected a brush in store (the first one that is mind) based on not only the quality/type but *look*. 

I fight at times not not place the looks of something above other stuff. For skincare it bothers me when some items don’t match others (but if I have it already I’ll use it up, no problem). 

I have to keep myself away from pinterest sometimes because I can spend a long time making boards that look very eye pleasing. 

I wonder what will happen when I get my own place, I would 100% be very picky about the stuff’s design (and durability, which is a good point). 

Is this normal? I don’t think I feel like freaking out when things look unpleasing to me, but I have an urge to make it pleasing, I take a looooong ass time picking items in stores. 

Just to add as well: I do not feel this way about people’s physical looks, in fact, I actually tends to be the opposite, I appreciate their uniqueness and “flaws”.",24Oct2019,10

There is an entire list of places she stopped, plus a list of drinks she sent me in private (which would give me away.)

I'm in the top university in our country but i came from a shitty public hs and i honestly dont know how i passed the exam of this uni and got accepted. Since i was such a shitty student back in hs, i entered uni with an absolutely bollocks skills in math and almost non existent study habit. Because of that i'm currently struggling in all of my classes as they are all just basically combination of math, physics, logic, etc. I'm on my way of failing all my classes. My confidence is crushed. I'm only in my first year and i'm already struggling so much. Im pretty sure i'd flunk harder on the next semesters. As much as i like the course, i cant handle the level of difficulty in this university. I wish i could just come home and then study at a near community college. That would tremendously help me as being away from home is really hard to handle too. There are a lot of days where im just contemplating wether i should just shift courses or just leave. But if i do either of those, i know how a lot of people in my life would be disappointed. Even me, i feel like a pussy just thinking about leaving. But i know it will make me way happier. I also know that if i leave this uni because its very hard, its like im gonna settle for the easier life and mediocrity. I dont know what do anymore. How far should i continue fighting?

For the first time in my entire life, I'm actually happy. I'm an optimist now and I always look at the glass half full. I'm strong and I'm proud of myself. With that, sometimes I can't always be strong and am reminded of how difficult things always have been. Last night, my dad and I spoke over the phone where I learned he had a heart attack. I'm the only person in my family who knows and my dad is certain his time is near. I believe him, he recently suffered a stroke as well. I haven't stopped crying because for the first time in either of our lives, we've been trying to build a healthier relationship and now that's being taken away from me. I spent my entire life with awful people who claimed to love me and didn't know how, they hurt and destroyed me.

I woke up with hickies all over my neck and naked. I didn’t process what happened to me until I talked to other people and they pointed out how messed up it was. 

The really scary part so I don’t remember if we had sex with a condom. When I slept with him before he complained the entire time so maybe this time when I was too drunk to know he went without. About 2 weeks after I had symptoms and got checked. I was told it was a yeast infection and had a sigh of relief. 

Well now it’s a month later and my symptoms have coming back. I got checked again by a different doctor and his questions really seemed to be suggesting my symptoms could be an sti. It’s treatable I think, but now I need to wait and I’m so nervous. 

What’s worse is that I currently have a boyfriend, one who I met after the incident and things are great, but still new. We use condoms, but if I tell him I have an STI we obviously would stop completely until I’m treated, but the news and lack of intimacy could make him break up with me.
