0,"I am in receipt of benefits i currently can't work , i am my daughters carer first and foremost to the best of my ability anyway. But i also struggle with my own mental health and if anything my daughters illness for the rest of her life has massively impacted me and i am struggling now more than ever. Money has always been tight i raised my daughter alone and have always done the best i can with what we have . But we were happy and had the things we needed without being lavish. A  few months ago i was sent a questionnaire off the dwp i thought it weird as you usually do these when you apply or renew a claim or have an assessment due. I filled out the form and noticed that the questions about mental health affecting you had been completely taken out , the whole section removed so it only asked me questions about physical ability . Which of course i am able it is my mind what lets me down . But i had to comply or they would stop my money so i sent back the form filled in. Few weeks pass and i receive a letter saying i have been found fit for work . I was flabbergasted and they said they would be sanctioning my money by 240 pounds a month . 70 pound a week is a lot of money to lose and i was panicking , we struggled already what would i do now . I phoned the dwp and they told me i would need to appeal my claim , it would go to court and i would face a tribunal and a panel of five . They get to decide what happens but if i win my case i will get the money back.  It could take up to twelve months . I ended the call and just sobbed i couldn't fight this now i had enough to worry about and i wasn't coping with that let alone losing all that money and not only that i couldn't apply for the loan i usually get each Christmas as i they are not given to people with sanctions . I couldn't believe this was happening to me and the thought of trying to fight the dwp on this knowing that every call to them i am on hold no less than an hour just to get through to them whilst having no money and trying to keep my daughters spirits up was near impossible in my mind i was just to tired . I can't get my head round why they are doing this to me when they can clearly see i am not coping. Would they cope in my shoes ?",19Nov2019,1
1,"So I am technically a minister through universal Life Church. this girl I got to talking to today said that she and her boyfriend want to get married soon cuz they did propose and they're all ready for it and they were thinking about doing it at April. She texted her boyfriend because he's out of state and ask if he wants to get married tomorrow and I said I do it as soon as you're ready. And so he said he could be down here in 14 hours. So sometime tomorrow I'm going to be marrying two people!

This is my first official officiated wedding! It actually funny enough I didn't know this but I can also do baptisms and funerals. I thought that was interesting",19Nov2019,1

I receive a text off my brother asking me why i am in bed in the afternoon, telling me i am lazy and idle and i need to get a job like every one else and he has to. Telling me i have had my time on benefits and if i thought anything of my daughter i would get a job and take her on holiday . He said what good is it me being here i can still be here for her and work . And if i am so bothered by my daughters illness see someone , get help. He called me weird said no wonder i had no friends and i do this to myself .

6,"I‚Äôm 22 and I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm about to live in two weeks. I currently have an apartment with my brother being paid for by my dad‚Äôs life insurance money, but my brother will be closing on a house soon. He wants me to move in with him, but I cannot stand living with him and his gf anymore. The house is also an hour away from my job. I have a friend who I could probably move in with, but it‚Äôs still up in the air. I just know I can‚Äôt move in with my brother. 

I‚Äôve been at the same grocery store job since I was 16. I climbed up the ladder as much as I can, but my store is low volume. I recently interviewed for an assistant CSM position at another location, and didn‚Äôt get the job. So for now I‚Äôm stuck working 30-35 hour weeks. 

I recently began dating someone 2 months ago. Things have been okay with her, but I‚Äôm still not exactly sure if I want to be totally committed to her because we‚Äôre in two different spots in life. I should also mention I work with her. Dating a coworker always seems like a good idea to me until I‚Äôm actually in the situation. Working with your lover really does complicate things. 

Now I‚Äôm really gonna sweeten this big, fat, ugly pot. I also work with my ex. We‚Äôve always been very civil and friendly towards one another but things have been getting extra friendly lately. There‚Äôs been no downright infidelity, but we‚Äôve been flirting with each other a ton. It‚Äôs been two years since we split and both of us have changed. Except both of us are in separate relationships. 

But I‚Äôve heard through a few different people (since word travels fast in retail) that she‚Äôs sick of her boyfriend and is only living with him because she has no one else to pay his half of the rent. The relationship has ran its course. Apparently she also wishes I would text her so we can just have an honest conversation. I don‚Äôt know where it would lead, but a huge part of me secretly wishes I could get back with her because I always viewed her as the one that got away. 

I was single for so long. I didn‚Äôt want to have romantic feelings for anyone just a few months ago. Then I started dating someone...and the floodgates ruptured. I hate pining after women. I hate hearing things through the grapevine and allowing myself to be sucked into dating my coworkers.

At this point I feel like I‚Äôve lost most of the control I previously had in my life. Things are just gonna go how they need to go. I view love as a vehicle, using me as the driver. Every time I start driving, I total the car 10 fuckin feet from my destination. Sometimes I really hate being human.",19Nov2019,1
8,"They had Gary Cohen on, today who was former white house staff. They asked him what he thought about the corporate tax cuts. He said there was no problem because while we collected less corporate taxes, the difference was made up by increased amount of personal income tax collected. He was very pleased with the impact of corporate tax cuts on his stock portfolio.  
  
How do professionals not realize that less money for consumers means less money in the long run for corporations? Who are they going to sell to when no one has any money left to buy things? These companies sure aren't going to pass their extra cash on to employees.

13,"So after lying awake racking my brain who had access to keys to my house . I know i changed the locks a few years back after i split with my boyfriend who had a key . I haven't been with anyone else since then so no one had access off me . My mum had a key as an emergency in her safe at her house and thats it , so that was the key that was used to gain access. But was it where it should be was my next question . I know my brother has access to my mums house , he has a key and he also has some crack head mates as well who i wouldn't trust as far as i can throw . I asked my dad to check his safe that they were there and they were but my mum said they were not there the previous week . I don't know why she would have needed them the week before but the fact of the matter is is that is the key used to access my house while i was out but why ? I went home and noticed that my medicine cupboard in the kitchen was all messed up and i had a box of old medication in the cupboard i wasn't sure how to dispose of an when i opened the cupboard it fell out . But it was at the back . Very few people knew it was there.  So my mum and my brother have access but my mum was with me so leaves my brother . Is it too much to think he has gone to the dwp and said he thinks i am well thinking if he gets my money stopped i will have to get a job  because he thinks that is best for me . And it s my brother gaining access to my house with the key at my mums house and going through my things . Maybe photographing my messy house or beer bottles if i have drank the night before  maybe. I don't understand why he would need to come into my house or why my mum is helping him as she got me out the way by taking me out. Could they both be conspiring against me and why would family do that . My mum has made a point she thinks she could look after my daughter better as i have depression. But i would rather have her with me depressed or not , she needs me and  i need her. I am so hurt and confused",19Nov2019,1

19,"I've been trying for a week to get a simple thing working. It's a mod for Skyrim SE. You have to expect some trouble with that game, but you don't expect a week's worth of bullsh%t.

One mod *(one absolutely necessary gosh-darn mod)* doesn't work right, and it turns into a damn rabbit-hole of browsing old forum posts and guides. I found one ""complete guide"" to fixing the problem, which was hailed as the go-to perfect solution. Ten minutes and you're on smooth waters... It had undetailed instructions. Part of the process involved replacing some files with some other ones from the older version of the game. 
My newer version doesn't even have half the files I'm supposed to replace, so I've got no clue where to put the ones I've taken from the old version.
Trying to mirror the old one by putting the files where they *should* be just breaks more stuff.

I've downloaded some other mods which are supposed to help, one of which was made specifically to fix this problem. None of them work at all, and some of them just make more problems.

I was recommended a new mod organizer which is supposed to fix the problem with the other fixes not working, and the mod organizer doesn't f##king work. I looked up the error message it's giving me, and it just looks like a brand new rabbit-hole of problems that I just don't have the strength to face anymore.

On top of this, I have a new, expensive power supply for my computer, because I've been trying to upgrade it to handle Skyrim SE at decent settings. It doesn't work.

I figured it was a dud, and bought another one. Doesn't work.
I tried one from a different brand. Doesn't work. 

At this point, I can rule out a defective product as the source of the problem. I realize electronics are batch-tested, but no way did I get three bad ones in a row. They just don't f##king work in my computer. I cannot figure out why. I've spent hours looking for help online, and all I find is *""power supply not working? Test it with a paperclip! If it doesn't turn on, you need a new one!""*

I have *three* new ones! F##k computers! I wish I was born in a damn cave and got eaten by a f##king coyote before I ever heard the word *""computer!""*

I once spent an entire night modding The Sims 2 to stop that broken-ass old game from corrupting itself every time I fart! And it f##ing worked!

I spent a week getting the original Skyrim's mods to work right. Yes, this particular mod too! And guess what? They all f##ing worked!

I‚Äôve been able to do all the goals I‚Äôd set out for the year and I feel amazing about it.

Title kind of says it all. Honestly I have mixed feelings about my situation... I'd like a relationship to see what it's like and I'd like to connect with someone on a level beyond friendship. 

I have no trouble making friends and am pretty content with my social life. I have a small circle of close friends who mean the world to me, and more friends I enjoy spending time with but I'm not as close to. I wouldn't call myself shy, but I would say I'm more of an introvert than extrovert and enjoy my own company. 

I guess I just get awkward around people I do like and usually end up at a party with them where I drink too much and it never ends well (sometimes sleeping together, then being told in the morning that they don't want to be anything more than friends, and me being distraught). This was mostly during my university days. Now I feel as though I'm becoming a virgin all over again; I've kissed some guys since but haven't had sex for several years. I've always been a little funny about sex - knowing that I'd get too attached so kind of avoiding it to protect myself. 

What I'd really like is to have someone who's not just a friend who I really feel comfortable around and could be romantic with. It's hard to put into words exactly, I do feel like I'm missing out and am mystified by friends who seem to constantly be in a relationship, while I've had absolutely none of that. 

I know people say there's no point in having a boyfriend or girlfriend just for the sake of having one, but I also am getting increasingly self conscious as I get older that I've never been in a relationship. I start to think, if I were to get to that stage with someone and I'm say, 26, I'll have to tell them I've never been in a relationship. Would that scare them away?

37,"Hello,

bear with me as I give some background:  I was born AFAB, I (42f) transitioned to a trans male when was 20yo, I transitioned back to female when I was 35yo.

Okay.... When I was 22yo (sept 1999) I decided to change my name from a pretty girly one. I petitioned the court and it was granted. I take a couple copies of the name change order to pass around to the various government entities and companies/organizations that needed my new legal name. I however didn't see the point in changing the name on my birth certificate.

Fast forward to 20yrs later (nov 2019) I go into the records office to get another copy so I can get an enhanced id. They apparently don't have a record of the order. They can easily find the petition but the order (the important thing proving my name change went through) is missing.  

After a couple hours of them sending me around to various offices they admit they lost the order and have me fill out another petition, a judge is nice enough to see me real quick on short notice. By the time I was finished with the court judge I had to go to an appt.

So I have two copies of the name change order sitting on my couch. I am going to the recorders office tomorrow to let the State courthouse have legal proof of my name, the name I have been going under for the past 20 years.

tl;dr- I spent 20yrs with a name I couldn't prove was legal because of a recorders fuck up.",19Nov2019,1

49,"Recently, I got into an argument with three of my friends. They are my closest friends, but they are toxic and I don‚Äôt know what to do with them. This is my story.

A couple years ago, I met my best friend. Let‚Äôs call him Alex. Alex was super chill and he was totally willing to be my friend, and we would always play together on xbox and send each other memes and shit on messages. You know, the usual friendship. He had another friend, let‚Äôs  call him Mason. I was fine with Mason, but he was a little toxic and got to my nerves.

Our friendship went on like this for another year or two, until I met this guy who we‚Äôll call Hunter. Hunter changed everything for me and my friends. I met him in 8th grade, because we had math class together. I quickly got used to his personality and we became friends. He was a cool person to be around at first, and we could both screw around in the classroom and do stupid shit together like throw pencils at the teacher, and play stupid games or whatever. In the middle of 8th grade, I introduced Hunter to our friend group. Both Alex and Mason liked him and took him almost instantly.

When the school year ended, I went on a trip to Turkey to go see my dad there and I left my friends in America for about two months while I got to hang out with my dad. I didn‚Äôt really keep in touch with them because I was too busy having fun in Turkey to really check my phone and respond to their messages.

When I got back home, I found out that Alex and Mason had an argument with Hunter and they decided to kick him from the group. They told me he was being an asshole to them and that he was manipulating people, making shit up about them and lying behind their back. I couldn‚Äôt believe any of this, because I found Hunter to be an extremely chill guy and not toxic at all.

While Alex and Mason talked shit about hunter for the next few months, I didn‚Äôt join in. I still liked Hunter and we didn‚Äôt have any beef, so I one day friended him and asked him what was going on, and how life was over xbox. As soon as Alex and Mason found out, they told me that I ‚Äúditched them‚Äù and that I was a ‚Äúfake friend‚Äù and a whole bunch of other bullshit. Hunter told me it was fine and that I should ditch them and make new friends, or hang out with him. I agreed.

For about a week I played with Hunter on xbox. We mainly just joked around about last year, since we didn‚Äôt have any classes this year. The memories and all the good times we were sharing with each other was nice.

After a week, I really started to miss my old friends. Hunter started becoming a toxic fuck. He would make offensive jokes and when I would tell him to stop, he‚Äôd make fun of me. I look very Asian and he would always make fun of me for it. When I would try and talk to him, he‚Äôd start saying ‚ÄúChing Chong‚Äù or some shit like that to try and get my to stop. I told him that it wasn‚Äôt funny and it was getting on my nerves.

I told Alex and Mason my situation and that I was sorry and ready to be a better friend. They accepted my apology and I came back into the friend group. I ditched Hunter.

A couple months later out of the blue, Mason invited him into the group again. I got extremely pissed at them, and called them hypocrites for getting mad at me for hanging out with him and then doing the same shit. They just told me ‚Äúoh well, we‚Äôll just kick you from the group if you don‚Äôt shut the fuck up,‚Äù so I stopped. I just took hunter in without saying anything.

Everything changed. He was extremely toxic and he would make things up behind my back and lie to people. He would tell people shit that he wasn‚Äôt supposed to tell.

Alex was my best friend. He was such a cool guy and he always kept my secrets. He understood me and would listen to me when I wanted to talk. He would always look forward to 6th period with me and we would laugh and have fun together and share secrets.

Alex was the first person who I ever told my secrets to - the biggest one being that I was gay. I liked boys (I still do) and I didn‚Äôt want anyone to know. He hasn‚Äôt told anyone to this day, which shows he‚Äôs a true friend.

Mason was the second person who I told to. However, the reason that I told him was because I had a gay crush on him and I wanted him to know. He told me he was sorry and that he didn‚Äôt feel the same way, which I was fine with. I told him not to tell anyone.

The dipshit told hunter.

Now, keep in mind that I strongly dislike hunter and he was the last person that I ever wanted to know my deepest secrets. Mason sent the screenshots of my awkward-ass confession to hunter, who posted that confession on social media. The whole school now knows and mocks me for it.

I confronted him about it. He told me to fuck off and that it was all a joke. And this is where I snapped. I yelled at him, told him how much of an asshole he was to me, and that this wasn‚Äôt a joke and that he was ruining my life. But he didn‚Äôt care!

9:00 pm that day, I receive a text message from him. He says, ‚Äúur out.‚Äù

I reply with, ‚Äúok.‚Äù

‚ÄúWant me to rephrase that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre out. Out of the group.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the leader.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, we all decided.‚Äù

What? This is the one line of text I will never forget. That one line stressed me the fuck out. I was about to lose my friends, and I didn‚Äôt have any other. I was fine with losing hunter and mason, but Alex was such a cool guy! I‚Äôd never done anything to him to make him mad or upset. Obviously, hunter made something up just to get me out of the group.

20 minutes later, I receive a text from Alex. My best friend, who‚Äôs never been mad at me before.

‚ÄúDue to a majority, you‚Äôre out of the group. Pack your bags, grab your shit and leave. You‚Äôre out.‚Äù He then proceeds to block me.

And here we are now! I‚Äôm laying in my bed, half crying, extremely depressed and stressed. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore or who to talk to. Reddit‚Äôs got my back, so I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôll just post my story here and if people want to help, that would be great. Thank you for listening to my story.",19Nov2019,1

60,"I'll share the whole story to give more perspective. It's going to be long. I understand if it's too much but the whole picture matters a lot.

A couple of months ago I was with a girl for 2 and a half years. I've gone into a phase of self-destructive tendencies that affected us both. I loved her, and love her still but I started closing into myself and didn't show much affection for her. At that point, I assume she started acting really clingy, possessive and a little angry at times because I acted the way I did. She still loved me a ton and I can now understand that she was clawing, kicking and screaming for the person I was and still am before the phase I was in. We spiraled and started arguing more and more, I was annoyed by the way she was acting without realizing why. So we argued one day, a lot, we were meeting a couple of friends outside and she left early without me because she was angry. That pissed me off, combined with bottled emotions and the shitfest I was experiencing at the time made me end the relationship. I told her I couldn't be in a relationship this way. I must say that I communicate very poorly,  I didn't tell her what's going on and how i'm feeling at all.

She was devastated, we both cried like little babies. The next morning I regretted it instantly. I told her that I want to keep this going that I need to communicate better and we should give it another go. She said yes.

Now here is the point that I fuck up. I still feel shitty that I didn't handle it differently and that I didn't realize what I was doing. I understand this will probably be the stupidest thing you'll ever probably read but here's what happened;

I started closing myself in again, I went back on the same old road I was before without fixing it. She made contact with me tried to get things fixed, and I said that I don't want to feel this way ever again and I'm unsure if this will happen again and that I don't want to hurt her. She invited me to her house to figure it out so I went. We tried working it out but I was still left with this feeling of uncertainty and just anxiety, I didn't want this to go on and keep spiraling with her the way I did. So I closed myself off, we stopped talking for about a month. I never truly felt like we broke up, I took her for granted and still had a feeling that we're attached to each other, without realizing that I've left her. It's incredibly idiotic and self-absorbed but that's the ugly truth.

At that point is where I started feeling better, and I've realized that she's the girl I'm in love with. I realized that what i've done is incredibly stupid and selfish. I left her be without communicating properly of what's going on with me, and that it's not because I don't love her.

At this point I should say that she was due to go to a student exchange for 6 months. and the following happened about a week before she was due to leave;

I invited her for coffee and told her everything, that we should start over. She said she has to think about it and she will answer me in the morning.

This is what she told me; She said that she's uncertain of her future with me. That what i've done made her feel like shit and doesn't know if this is the right way forward. She said that she still loves me but she can't do this again long-distance because she can end up being hurt again and that she would devour our relationship because she would wonder about if we're okay and if we broke up again it would kill her. So she told me that we'll remain friends and we'll see how we are when she comes back from her exchange.

I was left devastated, my whole world just shattered. I've took her for granted, left her after the incident without realizing or actually taking in what i've done and am doing. Now I was left with this big black hole inside my chest, I couldn't eat, sleep, drink, go out nothing. I cried days and days and just eat myself alive with my thoughts.

She then invited everyone in the chat of a group of friends to come and visit over a period of 10 days. I've decided that I can't go out like this that she means too much to me to just accept and do nothing. So I told her that I wanted to come if she's okay with it, and that I was the only one that took her up to her invitation and if she's okay with that. She said yes, but then told me if I'm sure that I can handle coming over. I said yes. I packed my bags, left everything behind, took leave at work and planned to go over, and set things straight. Show her how much I still cared, that we have a lot of fun together and ultimately start over. That was pretty much my plan.

I arrived there and we started hanging out, we slept in the same bed we went out sightseeing and such, we had a lot of fun. Fast-forward 8 days in, I wanted to have THE talk with her. So we started talking, we both cried I've tried to explain to her why it happened. She said that she still loves me, and she knows that we're great together but the answer was still the same; She doesn't know if this is the right thing to do, and that we'll see eachother everything she comes back to our home country and that we will see if we reconnect after she ultimately comes back. After we had the talk the genuine feeling I had was like we're back together but still weren't, with all the cuddling and everything that couples do.

We texted for a month or so, after a while she started texting back in longer and longer time spans. Coming to a point where she would text back in the morning and evening. And that upset me because I know she uses her phone to get around, and that if she can't even take 2 minutes to text me back every other hour or so, anything really I don't care if it's 5 hours just not these calculated morning/evening patterns. So after a while of that I got sick of feeling like a pile of garbage, a trashcan filled with just raw emotion which I didn't feel like I was getting back. So I replied in a two-word manner and stopped talking to her. I said to myself that if she wants to reach out to me and talk, she will. 

It's now been a week or so of not talking to her at all, and I'm completely devastated. I sleep for 4 hours every day because I can't stop this relentless negative thought train that she's gone from my life forever, and the fact that she doesn't reach out to me just solidifies that. She comes home thing weekend, but to be honest with you I don't think she'll contact me to hang out even if she said that we will when i was visiting. I don't know what's going on inside her head. I love her with my every being and would give anything for her. But I can't stop thinking that she just doesn't love me anymore, or never actually did - not the same way I love her. I know this is ultimately all my fault, I eat myself alive every day for doing what I did.

I don't know what to do... I can't keep living life the way I'm living it now this has to stop. I don't know if her response of ""we'll see how we are after I come back"" is just some excruciating way to delay that we're over or if there's actually future there.

I can't stand thinking of losing her, or being with anyone else. She's a beautiful person and I'm slowly spiraling out of control just off the thought that this is over... I know the whole thing is probably really stupid to a lot of you but this is the ugly truth, everything that happened, and I blame myself for everything.

I don't know what to do next... I feel like moving on would be the healthiest thing to do but I just love her so much I can't stand the thought of not being with her.

67,"This is the first and only job I‚Äôve ever had. Back in June I started working as a barista at Caribou Coffee and I absolutely love working there. After only five and a half months of working there I have become more social and confident.

When I first got the job, I was heavily shy, yet I don‚Äôt think I was ever introverted. Due to this, I was a little worried about not being able to finish the training. With the added fact that I knew nobody who worked there.

After a month and a half of working there, I was no longer shy. I was far more social then before. 

Everyone else who works there is awesome. Even though everyone is really different from each other, we are all the same in a shape or form. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to join in on their friendly banter, but I‚Äôm fine with my major differences from them. It makes us fell more like an honorary family.

We have our banter, our laughs, our simple moments, and even moments when I threw two of my coworkers for a loop by dropping the f-bomb, which by the way they jokingly judged me for saying f-word instead of f***.

The working conditions are really great as well. A simple layout, it is a coffee shop after all, and a great amount of employees working at a specific shift.

Of course the job isn‚Äôt 100% perfect. But all of those are small personal irks that aren‚Äôt worth mentioning. Like the small sizes of our trash cans in the bar area.

I understand that not many people enjoy their fast food or retail job. Some may not be lucky with coworkers, management, pay, or working conditions, and it hurts seeing so many ‚ÄúI hate my job‚Äù posts online.

69,"I posted about me marrying these 2 20 something-year-olds today, but I'm not sure how I feel about it now. I'm not saying I don't want to do this, its more that I can't tell if this girl is a pathological liar or she has no sympathy for her past. She tells me, a complete stranger that she lived in El Salvador where her father beat her senseless, her father would yell, hit, and call her names. He was so mad that she wasn't a boy when in the womb because he saw triplets and assumed all 3 were boys cause he couldn't see one of them.   


She goes on to tell me stories about how she was going to get groceries in El Salvador and 1 chick said ""lets go! Lets rush it and hope for the best!"" where the girl \[the patho\] said she took the girl and banged her head against a rock and killed her because she was ""saving"" everyone else. But then they were stuck there for a week. They had no food and ""ate the girl"" she ate her intestines and got an infection. See how bloated and bullshit that story sounds? On top of that, she made it sound like a wonderful time. Bullshit. Who the fuck is like ""YEAH IM COMPLETELY OK WITH THIS 10 YEARS LATER."" 

&amp;#x200B;

She goes on to tell me that every boyfriend she's had was an asshole, 1 bought cigs to just light and put out on her, this one yells and screams at her but she fights back from what she says. She said 1 time some baby sitter cut her finger open to the point where it was bleeding all over the floor and she told her to suck on the blood till it stopped and now she likes drinking blood. Again, bullshit. This was all in America. She showed me the scar too. That could have been from numerous things. 

She then tells us she has a rape fetish. Says ""I sometimes fantasize about some men in the mall, like I see a group of black guys and I would love for them to take me off and rape me."" No, you don't have a rape fantasy you have a ""play rough fantasy."" I've never once heard anyone have a legit rape fantasy. If someone took you to the side and FORCED a dick into you, you don't think you'd be a bit scared? Bullshit

&amp;#x200B;

All her stories sounded like some bullshit updated book called ""A Child Called ""It""""   


It's a book about this boy in the 60s that was abused by his mother severely. Starved, beaten, burned, tortured beyond belief. The man didn't write the book until he was in his 30's or 40's after his mother died. Burn in hell whore. She had other children but for some reason. she would treat him like shit. why this kid never ran away I won't know.

For me: probably yes, though he would be disappointed i started smoking somewhere after my 18th, since that is something he would be convinced he would never do. I suppose he would be amazed i was able to build a career as a developer. It's maybe not what he was thinking at the time but then again, since he was working for the postal office it would be a big step up (though do not tell him how long he would have to work there). I guess my 18y/o self would have expected my current self to at least have a nice relationship.

But it doesn't work like that anymore, I have to be brave, I have to be the rock, my gf can't run or hide and to be honest neither could I.

I feel like a child, just pretending to be a grown up, I want to get lectured and say I won't do it again but it's too late, I have to stand up straight and move forward even though my knees are going to be shaking all the way. if this is the case I can't be a child anymore, It is time to grow up.",19Nov2019,2

For a couple of years out of high school I didn't even wear shorts altogether. 

However, one day, I decided to go shorts shopping. And as a sort of joke for myself, I picked out a pair that ended 3-4 inches above my knee, and would end up around mid-thigh when sitting. And I was surprised, I actually really liked it! It didn't look as bad on me as I expected, and certainly was a lot more comfortable than the longer shorts I had worn in my youth. 

The style in my area hasn't really changed, so people definitely give me looks for all the extra leg I'm showing, but at this point I'm old enough to not care anymore. I'm definitely not wearing knee-length or longer shorts ever again.

I find it funny how my taste in shorts changed so much from my youth though.",19Nov2019,1
93,"I am unhappy with my working life. I currently work a part time job as a janitor, a second part time job as an independent contractor, and I own a start up that has yet to turn a profit (but we‚Äôre getting closer with each project). I love my business and would love to see it flourish, and my independent contracting pays well/is flexible. My janitor job‚Ä¶ eh. I want to quit it and focus entirely on the other two, but I‚Äôm worried it won‚Äôt be financially feasible. 

My day goes like this. Get up at 5 AM, get dressed and drink coffee, get the kids up for school, send them off on the bus, get to work at 7 AM, clean until 10:30 AM or 11 AM, go to the gym for an hour (if I have the energy), come home, eat something, grab a shower, work on my contracting work until 4 or 5 PM, fix dinner for family, eat dinner, crash on the couch until bedtime at 9 PM, and then do it all over again. Spare time is usually dedicated to improving the business, but often there's no time or energy left.

Each job has its pros and cons. 

Janitor:

* Pros ‚Äì Keeps me active, only 3-4 hours M-F, simple work, regular paycheck with taxes taken out
* Cons ‚Äì So repetitive and tedious, seems pointless because I do the same stuff every single day, and I‚Äôm absolutely exhausted by the time I clock out, meaning I have little to no energy to spend doing things I want to do. I‚Äôve come to dread Mondays.

Independent Contracting: 

* Pros ‚Äì I‚Äôm good at it, helps others, creative in nature, remote/work at home (which is SUCH a blessing), great support from higher ups, I get to work completely alone (no dealing with people!), flexible hours, pays well seasonally.
* Cons ‚Äì Easy to get burnt out on a daily basis, workload drops significantly in certain parts of the year, I have to handle the taxes myself.

Business:

* Pros ‚Äì It‚Äôs my passion, it‚Äôs creative, I‚Äôm my own boss, and it‚Äôs easy for me to stay motivated because I‚Äôm emotionally invested in the work
* Cons ‚Äì No profit thus far (so can‚Äôt make a living off it yet), I‚Äôm doing all the work (marketing, organization, legal, taxes, etc.) myself, and it gets overwhelming sometimes.

My ideal job: Working from home as my own boss, creative work, flexible but available hours, regular work throughout the year, and pay that will allow me to comfortably pay my bills and have enough left over to build a nest egg and splurge every so often. I also love entertainment/performing... just seems like there's not much money in it where I live, and I definitely don't want to relocate (married with kids and my family is here).

What doubly sucks is that I feel a lot of people went to school for the career they are in. I went to school for entertainment, but by the end of college, I felt like I didn't want that to be my job. So I've been living on ""day jobs"" since graduating years ago, and I feel unfulfilled. I want to do something in entertainment, but as I said, it's not likely going to be financially feasible, and I'm also scared that part of my passion will just become work if I make it my job. 

I don‚Äôt mind work. I‚Äôm not a lazy person. I can be very driven and motivated. I don‚Äôt hate cleaning. I just hate GOING TO work, and I hate working around people who are ‚Äúin charge‚Äù of me. Working at home is the best, and working for myself is even better. I want time and energy to devote to going to the gym, taking care of myself, exploring my creative interests, and developing my brand. Kind of hard to do all that when all I want to do is lock myself in my house and pass out after 4 hours of basic work.

96,"I have a ""boomer mentality"" and I'm doing better than everyone my age I know.

While GenX and baby boomers have their flaws I think they have a better understanding of life then my generation, millennials. :( I'll explain a bit about what I'm saying...

The whole ""ok boomer"" shows that millennials can't gather an actual rebuttal to their argument. ""You didn't have it half as bad as we did."" ""Ok boomer."" What? For being the smart generation we sound stupid. Lol. Why not make a valid point. ""You're right grandpa, but isn't the purpose of technology to make lives easier?"" 

Baby boomers will say ""just go out and work."" Then boomers will state how there's no jobs, or the economy is fucked up. That's true but there's plenty of jobs, we just don't went them. There's a nationwide shortage of labor and skilled crafts. I know guys fresh out of high school making $50k a year as labors, carpenters, electrician , etc. You don't NEED a degree. The average age in the trades is on the 50s, plenty of work. In a few few years you're easily making above the national average. 

They call is lazy, we argue. I don't have a valid argument there, most young people are lazy these days. They aren't driven. They'd rather live with mom and dad than work a second job. 

We complain. This is true. There's a plague  of this helpless victim metallurgy.

My ex (23 F) of 7 months just broke up with me (21 M) a few days ago. It was pretty ugly my heart was broken and I said some harsh things to her. The next day we both apologized and hugged kissed goodbye. We have talked since then and have both expressed that we still love each other and we are both hurting. We have decided that we both need time to work on ourselves and can stay friends during the process and still be there for one another. Eventually getting back together is a goal of mine that I have expressed, and she said it‚Äôs not off the table. 

Our sexual relationship has always been great. I told her I fear that I will be hurt when she finds someone new and she said she has the same fear. I want to continue having sex with her to keep both our needs met without the pain involved of one or both of us seeking new partners. How do I ask her, or make myself available? Would it be weird since she is the one who broke up with me?

TL;DR My ex-girlfriend and I love each other and may possibly get back together in the future. How do I ask her for us to continue having sex so neither of us has to find a new partner?",19Nov2019,1
100,"I've tried posting a couple of times in various places on reddit soliciting advice about my crush and gotten very little response. I expect this won't either but I'm kind of going mad thinking about it and writing some of my thoughts down does prove cathartic, even if I don't get any advice.

So I have a coworker who, while I have always thought was beautiful, I didn't really know very well so assumed we probably wouldn't get on (having made some assumptions about her personality) until quite recently when we've been having deeper one-on-one conversations more often, and found out we have more in common than I thought, and just last week after a really deep chat my mild attraction to her turned into a full head-over-heels crush. Unfortunately I also learned last week that she was still seeing a guy she met through online dating. I think they've only been together a few weeks, and from what little chatter I've been able to overhear in the office, there's a chance things between them aren't going so well, so I may have a chance of success if I confess my feelings to her before she gets any more invested. As I once read somewhere on reddit - she can't make a choice if she doesn't know she has it.

The problem is, I'm not sure of their relationship status at all, and I don't know if she is even remotely interested in me as anything more than a friend (I am really bad at picking up on signals though). So I've decided that tomorrow I'm going to go to a mutual friend in the office (somebody who knows her pretty well and also likes me) and ask her for advice on a ""dilemma"" I'm facing. I won't say who I'm crushing on, just keep it general and see if she thinks it's a good idea or not to confess my feelings to a girl who might be seeing someone else. Then if she isn't immediately horrified, I will probably tell her who it is and can specifically ask about her current relationship and if she thinks I have a chance. If she thinks it's a bad idea, I'll hopefully be able to move on without ever having to make things awkward with my crush, since we still have to work together and I'd rather not risk pissing her off in the worst case scenario. Fingers crossed that she thinks I have a chance. Either way, I can hopefully stop feeling so distracted by this.",19Nov2019,3

113,"I'd figured I would set the record straight about the 'pills' that I'm taking. About twice a month I head over to the local Walmart pharmacy and purchase a 60-count box of Primatene. It's sold as a over the counter medication to relieve the symptoms of bronchitis. For me, it relieves the symptoms (or should I say side effects) of old military injuries.

The first injury occurred during Navy recruit training. We had a team of recruit trainers who would eventually be replaced after the Navy completed a legal investigation. I was in Division 187 with a start date of February 20, 1996. While running uncontrolled laps around an indoor track (it was during the dead of winter) during a chaotic session of physical training, I slammed into a bollard at full running speed. What are those and what do they look like?

[Bollard](https://ibb.co/7pSByLF)

I made contact with it about waist height. Physics can be an interesting thing. The contact lifted me off my feet and shot me straight up into the air. I then somehow went headfirst down towards the concrete at an angle and slammed my face into the other side of the bollard. I ended up being seriously injured and pass a large amount of bright red blood during a bowel movement that night. I wanted to remain in boot camp because I didn't know what would  happen so I never told anyone. I'm not a doctor, but I think it did some serious damage that's become problematic as I get older.

The second injury was due to asbestos exposure. For those of you who received training for the Aviation Ordnanceman (AO) rating in Millington Tennessee,  those buildings were eventually  condemned. If my memory serves me correctly I was bunked within Building South #420. Those of you who attended very last AO class at that location probably remember the briefing they made us all attend. That was because the building contained very high levels of asbestos.  So much, in fact, they had to perform an environmental assessment prior to cleaning it up. They (local and state authorities) were so concerned about the level of asbestos present, they wanted to ensure it did not contaminate the local area.

Since my discharge from the U.S. Navy, I've had lung and throat problems. Very weird issues of strain, pain, and just a feeling that there was something blocking my throat. Very uncomfortable feeling. Over time I literally lost the ability to liberally consume dairy products. The resulting mucus would block my throat and make it hard to breathe. God help my sorry ass if I consumed dairy before going to sleep.

Primatene eliminates the mucus. I can eat diary and still breathe. No, I don't have a history of asthma and never have at any point of my life. As a kid I used to run track in addition to a rigorous life of skateboarding.

To ignorant assholes mocking the fact that I use these medication are just showing your ignorance. While this substance is beneficial, I'm still on the losing side of the war.
