1,"Used to be you actually got something for free with no strings attached. But the past few years I've been seeing BOGO coupons or discount coupons as the freebie. Case in point Fazoli's (a commercialized Italian restaurant chain used to offer an actual Free chocolate chunk cookie. Now they only offer a coupon for $3 off a $10 purchase coupon. Which is often available in their regular coupon flyers.

I think I got maybe 2 actual freebies  last year. Used to be I got at least ten.

2,"I asked a mutual friend if she could take photographs of me. I really for once wanted professional photographs done however, I had no idea that she actually hates being asked to do photoshoots. I learned this just now from a mutual friend since she didn’t reply to my initial message. 

I felt like she was somewhat avoiding me more than normal and also this was ruminating in my mind here and there.

I talked to the mutual friend and he says she isn’t the type to get mad, maybe annoyed but not seriously angry. So I should let it be since I didn’t know also she could be annoyed that I spoke to someone else about this. 

Anyhow had to vent on here. I admit I’m a bit of a people pleaser lol so doing stuff that accidentally insults people kinda makes me feel extra worse.",02Sep2019,1
3,"I am just happy for next month...

Roommate leaving and then I can finally have my living room...

4,"For the past few months, I've been trying to call the Samaritans in the night. This is usually the busiest time, so naturally I'm placed on hold.

During this time, my heart rate increases and try to think of all the things I want to say. I feel like I would be wasting their time and I start to question why I'm really calling. I dismiss the idea of being depressed and I feel like I don't have anything to say.

Because of this, I always hang up before anyone picks up.

Whenever I check my recent calls, I notice that the time I stay on hold for has been increasing. My highest was 3 minutes and 15 seconds. I was still on hold, but this feels like an achievement to me.",02Sep2019,7
5,"I had close friends who had always come to me with their mental health. I was the friend everyone could come to, to vent to. I was always happy to hear and help them, and part of me always thought ""wow I'm glad I don't have that, they're having a horrible time"" because I couldn't relate. Truth was I was constantly in pain like them, but always downplayed it and thought it was normal because it didn't manifest how I expected. 

From the outside you would think I was fine, I have a large group of friends, family who love me and try to be a productive adult, but it was never enough and I didn't know why. I had a void that I tried to patch over by keeping busy, if I wasn't constantly busy I'd spiral and I hated not being the person I knew I could be. Depression is like a fog over your entire life. It may slowly slide in before you realised it's covering everything. The worst is not knowing what is happening. 

Everything in my life was so difficult to do, going for a run was equally difficult as brushing my teeth or getting out of my bed and I always blamed it on me being lazy. ""life is this hard for everyone"" but it wasn't, and shouldn't be. I spiralled hard over the past year and knew something was wrong but couldn't pinpoint what. Each day, as hard as the last, each day only containing small gulps of happiness compared with what I had in the past. 

The worst of it is how depression isolated you, when you desperately want to be close to people. You KNOW exactly the things that would help you, eating well, hanging with friends, going for a walk, but your brain sucks all vitality, all motivation out of you.

I thought I understood depression, it's symptoms and even what it would feel like to have it, but I was wrong. I lived with a debilitating illness for years and was always barely keeping my ahead above the water the entire time. Only reason I managed to keep paddling over the years was due to already doing a lot of proactive behaviours. I'm going to fight this thing, like I have been doing for years and I can't let it win. 

Fuck depression.",02Sep2019,13
6,"I've been slim my entire life. At the moment, I'm 5' 9"", and i only weigh 110 lbs. I sometimes forget to eat, and my daily caloric intake can go as low as 1300 calories per day. But for some reason, I want to gain weight above and beyond a healthy BMI. You could even say I want to be obese--the maximum weight I'd want to reach would be about 400 lbs. I don't know why I'm like this, but I've felt this way since puberty.

I feel very insecure about this. I feel weird and disgusting for wanting to be fat. I do know that there are other people like this, but that doesn't make me feel any better. To make things worse, I still live with my parents, and my mother really dislikes fat people. She mentions people's weight all the time, laments modern obesity rates, and insists that I get small portions of everything. Needless to say, this makes me very uncomfortable.

I'm not sure what to do moving forward. I feel a strong internal pressure to gain weight, but other parts of me resist. I do think I should probably reach a healthy weight no matter what.",02Sep2019,0

13,"I have one close relationship, with my mom. She’s the only person in the whole world who I can chat and say things to without feeling constantly judged.

I have two friends, a dad, my sister, we talk but don’t connect.. And every time we do I have to think through everything. 

But i have never truly experienced a trusting unfiltered relationship. Like I’m talking about being able to talk about my actual problems like how Ive binged everyday for years or how i’ve been bullied, etc. 

A good example of this situation was when I was in grade 2, I needed glasses really badly. I couldn’t see the board at all. But I hid it for so long until years later I literally had to hold my books 2 cm away from my face to make out a single word. My mom realized and I got glasses. Another example was when I got bullied for a year or two straight. Never told or explained it to anyone. And it still haunts me to this day because ever since then I over analyze and have become sensitive to everything; I can’t say anything without thinking it about three times through. 

I am quite pathetic.",02Sep2019,3
14,"raindrops fell out from my computer screen. they came in a steady beat faster than a resting heart's but not in any hurry. the device was warm as a sleeping cat on my lap and likewise my room filled with the breath of a summer night. the droplets came calmly, nonchalantly from their place of origin and landed gently on my face. they should have felt cold.

I am a year away from going to university and I just really want my peace.

Is there a better way to find peace that doesn't involve me being tired all the time?

16,"I \[19F\] am a sophomore in college who has trouble committing to changing things about myself that I want to improve. My boyfriend \[19M\] and I have been together for almost 4 years and we have based the success of our relationship on communication. We grew up in similar family situations with narcissistic parents and a generally stressful environment, but developed different ways of coping and processing. He tends to be more strategic and thinks about how to improve/solve problems, whereas I tend to disassociate by going on my phone or watching videos to distract myself and stop thinking about the situation. 

Despite improvements to our communication skills over the years, we’re stuck in this spot where my bf has to initiate all conversations and it’s 50/50 whether I’m engaged or not. This has been putting a strain on our relationship and makes it hard for us to have good conversations because we’ve developed expectations of uncomfortable conversations. I generally get defensive whenever we talk about anything I could even remotely be blamed for. 

My goal is to be able to have engaging conversations with my bf and to be able to calm myself down when I get emotional or defensive. I am going to post an update every Sunday to commit to these goals and to hold myself accountable because I generally give up and don’t go through with things that even slightly inconvenience me.",02Sep2019,1
17,"This is one of my deepest and most hurtful personal shames. Sometime growing up around my pre teens I just became very attracted to white women. I had grown up in a lower income neighborhood in Chicago and then my family decided to move out of the city into a more rural part of Ohio. Once there I just started to really like white girls, eventually it went from a fascination into a preference, and now it's to the best of knowledge a full blown almost exclusive preference. I'm in my late 20s now, I've been like this for a while. It took me a very long time to admit it to myself and I have never and probably will never admit it out loud to another person.

When I'm even seen dating a white woman I catch so much shit that I just try and avoid the conversation, so even talking about a whiff of a preference is unimaginable. I dated a few black women to throw my family and friends off the scent. I felt enormous shame and fear that one day they'd put it all together. It makes me miserable, but I have tried so hard to change my mind, to make myself not like white women anymore and it never works, it only makes my attraction to them stronger. I tried going to a therapist once but chickened out before telling the therapist, he was a black man, what would he think of me? That I was less of a man? A race traitor? I went for weeks paying over $200 to basically dance around the subject.

I have nightmares people find out. I don't know why I'm broken this way, why I see the world this way. Why I like them so much. It's not self hate, I love being black, I love my culture, my family, my friends but when it comes to a romantic and sexual connection I have a preference that seems to fly in the face of all this. I feel like I'm evil, like something is morally wrong within me to be this way. I had to make this post because it's been eating me up inside for so long and I had to get it out even if it was to complete strangers.",02Sep2019,7
19,"I’ve just been stewing on some emotions that I feel like I need to let out so I decided to ramble. Anyways, feel free to read my inner thoughts and I hope I don’t come off as weird or whiny.

God I hate school. I despise it. The anxiety, behind finding someone to talk to so you don’t seem weird, constantly worrying about such stupid stuff like the way you’re walking, or just the self deprecation. It just gets to your head, worrying if you’ll fit in, if someone likes you as a person, if you really have friends, it’s just, it’s hard. Being socially conscious of things from what you’re wearing or if people are judging you for being alone. Or if someone actually likes you or are just being nice out of pity. Or finding a partner for an assignment when you have no friends. The feeling of awkwardness, shame, and self-pity when you have to tell the teacher you’re the only one with no partner because there’s an odd number of kids in the class. The heavy shame weighing you down as you walk to your new group and and the looks you get from them. Their pity or their annoyance at being paired with you, I see it all. 

Worrying about whether you should have said what you said or stressing about any tiny mistake you make. When even when you make friends you have to wonder if they view you the same way. Then you realize that they don’t and that you’re actually still an outcast, this time just in a smaller group. Overhearing a conversation and you get a glimpse into their true feelings. Being the shadow of the group, listening to what they say, knowing everything that goes on, and yet, you don’t matter. Is this what it feels like to be a background character? Probably. It’s just weird that while I’m a background character it seems that no one else is. They’re all main characters of their own stories. Why? Why am different when I try so hard not to be? Why am I the center of jokes but the only one who isn’t truly laughing? Why? Why am I the one that’s excluded? Why am I the one that grows more distant as less and less keeps them apart? Why am I the outcast?

These are questions I’ve never been able to answer or truly understand but in the end I’ve determined at least one factor. Hierarchy. It’s as simple as the fact that I am at the bottom. I’m just the guy who rarely speaks but is ignored when they have something to say. I’m the guys whose used at the butt of the jokes because I never let it show it hurts me. You know, that’s the one thing I truly pride myself on. Not showing my hurt. No matter how bad it gets, how bad I feel, I continue my facade and smile through the lump in my throat. I’m not bitter, just disappointed. Disappointed in myself for letting this get to me, for letting it get this far, for watching it all happen while being a bystander to my own fight. People say that everyone has a purpose and as far as I can tell, I’m just the extra . A side character.",02Sep2019,1
20,"I finally had a week off from school and had nothing to do at “work” so in turn my Screentime app says I spent 43 hours on my phone this week.

23,"I had lived in Ohio for 21 years, and now I was leaving; leaving every acre of corn and woods, every friend I had ever known, every love, every family, everything and everyone I ever knew was staying here, and I was leaving. Before I had felt giddy excitement for the possibilities in new places, but this day at 7pm, cruising to an astronomical high on some edibles with Sarah, I felt regret and sadness that I was leaving. We had decided to go on the physical trip only about a week ago (and the mental trip was planned with less time in advance). It was a spur of the moment decision, and both of us leapt at the opportunity to go mountain biking and camp with a friend for 3 days. We had both read independently about this park called “Mohican State Park” that supposedly had some of the raddest mountain biking in Central Ohio. I forget who asked who, but there had been a back and forth exchange of attempts to go on overnight trips with one another for a while now, so it’s a little foggy whose turn we were on, but someone asked and we immediately went into the planning phase with hardly a question of whether or not the other person would accept but a pre-knowledge that this would happen. 

We had only formally known each other for about 7 months, and by that I mean, she had followed me on Instagram when I had just entered a pre-veterinary program at the University of Toledo, and I had followed her back almost immediately. I was flattered when I saw she followed me. It felt purposeful because I knew none of her friends, none of her family, no distant connections, nothing, but I saw her account had a lot of similar interests, so it seemed like we were similar. I followed her, and we liked one another’s posts for a couple years, and in that way we followed each other as we grew and changed over that time, but we still didn’t even know each other yet. One day though, I looked down at my phone screen to see an Instagram notification, “Message from: Sarah.” 

“So, I know this is super random and I don’t know ya but I know you’re a big biker and I’m looking for someone to do some longer rides with if you’re interested and let me know!”

I felt like I was about to wake up any second and realize this was all just a dream, but it wasn’t, and I responded something along the lines of “Yeah absolutely I’d be down! What kind of bike do you ride?” And that was it. The start of knowing her. Within a week, I had told her about a mountain bike race that was happening up in Island Springs, Michigan. I asked if she wanted to come along with James and I in my Honda Accord Hybrid, you know, the type that has 5 seats, and trunk capacity for 15 gallons of milk or two extra large pillows? The three of us squeezed ourselves into that car with two bikes outside the trunk, wheels inside the trunk, and one bike riding on poor Sarah’s lap in the backseat. I still can’t believe she was okay with that, but it happened. She DJ’d from the back seat which she seemed very happy to do. She played some rock n’ roll, blues rock, some dance songs, and some 90’s. James and I subjected her to our inside jokes, strange videos of seals making noises with captions, a weird conspiracy theory that gravity wasn’t real and a negative force of an x-dimensional wave existed and held matter together by equilibrium, and plenty more on the way there, but she was totally down with all of it. It was pretty awesome. The race was over before we knew it, and we were all parting for the day. We all hugged, said goodbye, and waved before we drove away in the dark blue-grey rainy Ohio day. We started hanging out more, biking, climbing, going to the gym, and it was nice. I was really open with her because it was easy to say whatever I wanted to, around her.

My family had started the process of moving all of us out to Phoenix about a month after we met. This meant all summer that year, I was home alone, and as often as our schedules allowed, we met up and found some outdoor radicalness to do in Oak Openings -- the place to be for outdoorsy Northwestern Ohioans. I flirted with her, and she with me, but I never said anything about it or did anything much more to send signals. It never was the most pressing thing on my mind with her because I enjoyed her company so much, but sometime in late July I found out I would be leaving Ohio to go to Phoenix. I knew but didn’t tell any of my friends for about a month. When I finally did, I got to spend a lot of much-needed time with all of my longtime friends, and Sarah. She and I hung out more too. We started going out before the sun rose to climb this one flaky limestone wall next to an old quarry. It was wet, dark, freezing, but we brought coffee in a Thermos and steel cups to sip it out of while we watched each other pick lines up the wall or the rising sun pushing away the blue hue of the setting moon. It was remarkable how much energy two sleep-deprived 21 year-old-ish people can muster at 4am to hike out in the cold to do something with the only advantage of doing it then being the company of the other.

We left the last Friday night before I drove out to Phoenix, made the 4 hour drive into the night a little bit, set up camp, slept, and got up the next day to tackle the 25 mile, 2,800 feet of climb loop around Mohican State Park, then ate a couple of edibles I got from a friend as a celebration of the day’s riding. We figured out how much it would cost cause we were both pretty broke-ish at that moment. We decided, “Yeah, totally worth it” collectively. So, we drove in that Friday night after, only twice, I took a wrong turn and had to stop and turn around. It was the twilight of the evening when we registered at the camp office, but that was only about 7:30 pm. We both were a little hungry, I felt a little high even though I hadn’t eaten, smoked, etc’d anything in more than a couple days, so we went into the camp office for both food and a spot to sleep. We both headed to the coffee and hot chocolate machine. I poured a whopping cup of hot chocolate/coffee mocha-like drink. Sarah giggled when she saw me standing with my chocolate ice cream, marshmallows, hot mocha, and maybe beef jerky -- my memory is a little foggy in this time period due to a fairly severe concussion I got earlier that summer. She had her hot chocolate, chocolate milk, a candy bar, and bread. We checked out and sat outside in the cold on a bench, sitting close to stay warm while both eating and drinking hot and cold drinks and food at the same time. It was a weird sensation. Eventually we got tired and went to sleep in our individual hammock and tent. The next morning we woke up pretty early, brushed our teeth, drank some water, and got in the heated car to decide what to get for breakfast. We perused Google Maps until we found this one little diner like 4 miles away. We routed the map and headed out to breakfast. We arrived to the sight of a whole parking lot full of slightly-older nice cars. We walked up to the patio, guarded by three stairs to get up into the railed-in area before the entrance. I think I remember jumping up the three stairs and yelling “YEET,” if it wasn’t now, it was the next day, but I believe it was both. I heard her laugh behind me, so I swung the door open and smiled broadly as I held it open for her. We went inside and sat at a booth and waited eagerly in a cheerful half-silence, half-conversation thing of hunger. She got her hash browns before I got anything, but my waffles, French toast, and donut were out before her omelette and waffle stack. It was delicious, and definitely imprinted my soul with that syrupy, warm, fluffy feeling. We wrapped up there and went back to camp to get kitted up for the day of riding. It was starting to get warm when we started riding, but we had seen it would get cold later in the day, so we packed our jackets in our packs. We got into the groove and were making good time for the first few miles, but pretty soon I found our pace was slowing, and I was waiting more and more frequently for Sarah to catch up, and when she did, she would be out of breath and looking in pain. Around the 10 mile mark she asked if I would mind her taking a shortcut back to the car. I said not at all and gave her the key. We waved and headed away from each other. I had an awesome time in the meanwhile. The trail was a little damp, and super tacky on my new bike’s tires. I sped through everything while I was starting to learn what I can do with that bike. The green, yellow, and dark, wet brown of Ohio fall rolled up and down the trail and hills with me for the majority of the afternoon. I think it was about 4:30 when I rolled up to the car. Sarah had been there for a while. She started an Instagram story about how many apples she could eat before I finished riding. She got to 3 before I arrived. We drove back to the camp office to load ourselves down with food for the coming festivity. On the drive back to camp we pulled out our little baggy with two green gummies in it. We clinked them like saying cheers and chewed them up. The thick weed-y flavor hit pretty quick making me feel a little fuzzy for a few minutes, but it wore off, and Sarah described a similar feeling. We got back to camp about 25 minutes later, and we sat down at the picnic table where we decided to make a fire. We collected wood for a while till maybe an hour after we had eaten the edibles. By one and a half hours later we had been trying unsuccessfully to light a bunch of wet wood on fire with a little lighter, pizza boxes, and some paper. It wasn’t working, so she got up and sat at the picnic table closer to the road, and I kept squatting by the “fire” which I was nursing to life. Then the park ranger rolled up. We knew what he was going to ask about and we had determined our response. We had registered the night before for the campsite, and our validation ticket said 10/9/2018 when the day was 10/10/2018. We had paid for 10/10/2018 as well, but we just forgot to tear off the stub that said 10/10 from today’s registration before we put it in the mailbox. We explained that to the officer, and after approximately 10 of the longest minutes of my life with him asking us some other questions like, “How’s your stay so far? Was the riding decent with the rain today?” and other normal human conversational questions, he finally left. 

Sarah and I both watched him drive away into the silver-green evening down the wet road towards the park office miles down the road. When he finally rounded a bend out of sight, we both lost control. We laughed and laughed and rubbed our heads in complete shock that we had held ourselves together long enough not to get busted. At that point, we decided to go on an adventure. We had seen a section of trail that headed up and out of the river valley that we were camped in right down the road. We grabbed my backpack, stuffed two blocks of cheese, a bag of pretzels, four apples, and some granola bars into the backpack along with three liters of water…. For a 2 mile hike…. The sky was darker now, the sun slipping beyond the horizon, somewhere obscured by the small, heavily wooded mountains surrounding us. The world was bathed in dark hues of blue and grey. Everywhere we looked, the colors were saturated in the way that nature does when it rains. The wetness made every color more vibrant. The road was pitch black, and the yellow maple leaves that had fallen on it now took on a magical glow against the darkness of the blacktop. The trees to our left and right were a deep green with sparse highlights of bright pine needles lighting up the world.

In my own personal trance, I walked spellbound by the sounds, sights, and smells of the forest even while we hadn’t left the road.

“Justin, look at the leaves,” Sarah pointed like a child at the yellow leaves on the road, “They’re sparkling!!”

I looked down and saw the leaves no longer were just glowing but dancing about in swirls.

“Woah, that’s wild,” I replied. There was some story I told at that point, but I forget what it was.

The next vivid memory I have was starting the hike up, out of the valley. The trail was covered with the fascinating yellow leaves, and the trees made a tunnel around us, lighting the trail with a soft, bright, yellow-green light. We hiked in silence, hardly feeling the cardiovascular exertion we were experiencing. Eventually we got to a staircase a couple hundred vertical feet up the hill and maybe a mile from camp. We sat down and pulled out our “snackpack” as we called it. 

“Oh my gosh, this cheese is amazing,” I said, chewing dopily on a huge bite off my block of pepper jack.

Sarah laughed and kept munching on her pretzels, goofily staring straight ahead the whole time.

We got down to the last couple granola bars and two-thirds a liter of water when someone finally asked, “Which way is camp?”

Now, for a normal hike, this could be a valid question, but in our particular adventure… that should not have had to be asked. The only piece of information needed to get back to camp was to know which way was down the staircase we were sitting on. The problem was that neither of us could tell which way was up or down, so we laughed and laughed and laughed at the ridiculousness of our plight.

“We’re gonna be on ‘I Shouldn’t Be Alive’ from hiking a couple miles high, Sarah!” I said after I could finally contain my laughter enough to talk.

We laughed some more and eventually I suggested a direction I thought was down, and we pulled out our phone lights to hike back in the twilight darkness. We arrived back at camp, I started the fire briefly after some more struggle, and Sarah crawled into her tent and fell asleep. I ate some leftover pizza from the Leaning Tower of Pizza and joined the land of the unconscious in my hammock some 15 feet from Sarah’s tent. It was only about 10pm at that point.

My spine froze stiff, and I sat bolt upright in my hammock. The bone-chilling scream and subsequent growl of a large feline had woken me up at 1:30am. I looked over at the river where the sound seemed to come from then down at Sarah’s tent. She was sitting up too, and she looked over to me, and we simultaneously said, “CAR.”

We both grabbed our sleeping bags and hopped in the car. I was still super high, so the whole experience was lined in giddy humor to my brain, but we got in the car, I locked it, and we fell asleep.

“Hey…. hey...” I heard. My eyes slowly cracked open just a sliver. I saw the inside of the car and Sarah, still leaned back in her seat next to me in the dark.

“Uh?” I slurred back.

“Why did we never date or anything?” Sarah asked from the passenger seat.

“Idon’know. Why didn’t we?”

“You never said anything I guess.”

“Oh, It’s too bad,” I mumbled back through my sleep.

“We would’ve been good together, but I guess we’ll never know” she said back in a sleepy voice.

A lone tear welled up in my eye, but my body was too tired and high to move or to say anything intelligible. To this day though, I don’t know if this conversation was real or just a dream. I remember it clear as day, but I was too high to distinguish I think, so I’m left to wonder: to wonder if we had this exchange or if it was just my mind asking me why I never told her how I felt; to wonder what if I had said something; to wonder if she remembers this too.

Later, we moved back out of the car into the tent and hammock again. The next morning, we woke up, packed our stuff and got in the car, each of us feeling pretty high even after a night of sleep. We drove back to the diner without much conversation. The silence was weird. We hadn’t gone without talking non-stop almost the entire trip and the entire time we knew each other, but it was either that we were both high still or she and I were both thinking of the night before. I never asked. We got to the diner, and as the coffee flowed into our bodies, the words flowed out. We started recollecting the night before and our own individual takes on our experiences. She told me about the leaves how they looked to her, and how confused she was about the staircase being flat. I told her about the feeling of leaving earth as we hiked up into the yellow-green tunnel, and we both dissected the feline noise as much as we could.

We drove home that afternoon, and she played a bunch of folksy music she wanted me to hear so I had some diversity on my drive out to Phoenix the next week. We sang in the car all the way back through the rain to home. The sky cleared as we got to Toledo, and we hugged when we said goodbye, not knowing when the next time we’d see each other would be.

I saw her again the next spring. I was back in town visiting family and friends when I ran into her at the bouldering gym at the University of Toledo. She told me about some climbing trips she went on since the last time we talked, and I told her about some adventures I went on. We climbed for a few hours, hugged and parted. I think she’s dating someone else now, and so am I. 

Still, sometimes I wonder.",02Sep2019,2
24,It's making me miserable. I've been repeating my last daydream for a week. That was my only escape and I'm afraid I lost it. What if I can never daydream again? I don't think such a life would be worth living. Stuck in the humdrum of everyday life forever. I can't even sleep at night because I use my daydreams to keep my eyes shut for long enough to doze off and without them my brain wanders and keeps thinking of things it wants to do while I'm still tired.,02Sep2019,1

27,"Warning: this may get long.

I (F26) feel like I am a terrible person because of the anger, sadness and rage I feel inside myself (and often express outwardly).

I have never loved myself - the external and internal me. I don't want to cheapen my feelings but I am convinced that all of this stems from my abusive mother. I won't get into the details except to say that she has a way of gripping onto the worst part of people and manipulating it until that person is under her control.

I hadn't spoken to her for about 2 months and was honestly feeling okay. She called me about two weeks ago and the conversation went horribly, as usual. 

I was on the phone with her for less than 30 minutes and in that time she broke me down to rubble. I felt the way I did growing up. The hatred, resentment, anger I feel towards her was reflected in myself. 

I was upset and felt like human garbage the following days. And it has just snowballed out of control. 

I keep telling myself and my husband that I won't let it get to me but she creeps back into my mind at all times of the day. 

It makes me irritable. I snap at my husband. I start to project my feelings onto him and pick fights with him. I hate that I do this and I see myself doing this but I cannot stop. 

I am upgrading my mother from limited contact to just a text message or two every now and then. But I need help managing these negative feelings. 

I am going to try going to the gym and getting out more to channel some of it but it's one of those things that I know once I'm alone with my thoughts, my self-hatred will just resurface.

Any advice will help :-(",02Sep2019,2

30,"Sorry in advance if this is long which it most likely will be. Me from a few months ago probably would have never seen myself where I am today. A lot more social, and generally happy. I never cared for knowing a lot of people, just being close to like a couple (1 is fine even). And this summer I thought I achieved that. A friend from a club I'm in (17 m BTW), I started talking to more and we became really close friends. She is like the female me and we talked almost everyday. Recently though, the energy has been different or there is a lack thereof or both. She has been really distant and it feels like she is obligated to talk to me. I understand dynamics can and do change in any relationship but this feels terrible. It doesn't help that I'm an anxious person. I've thought it was my fault at times, perhaps I am too annoying or just not it. I have said something but even with assurance I feel like I've lost someone. Maybe I'm overreacting still. Maybe I'm being selfish or something because its not like I don't have other great people that I have met and talk to. But it still sucks.",02Sep2019,4
31,"I started dating this chick a few weeks ago. Things are going great. She's a lovely girl.  

I was feeling a bit sick and since my medical deductible has been met, I get checked out on every little thing. Pneumonia - doctor's visit. Dog bite, that's a doctor's visit. Throat sore? Doctor's visit. Insurance is great. 

I told her because we've been pioneering revolutionary cpr techniques in the back of my Honda Civic without the proper face shield protection. Turns out her throat is covered in white gunk; mine was only swollen red. I'm thinking since her diseased throat game is a little more advanced than mine that she's patient zero in this party of two.

So now I've got an unplanned vacation from work and I've got pass in a doctor's note when I get back. I've got two days to find the most objectionable, but not technically terminatable way to explain to my boss how I got sick.   


You guys are from the internet. What's the wrong way to describe kissing?",02Sep2019,1
32,"Two years ago my boyfriend who was in the military passed away while deployed in Syria. He was literally the best person in my life and unfortunately I have a hard time speaking my feelings so I haven’t ever really talked about his passing. Emotions is not something I deal with so I stay very private about the relationship we had and it’s quite hard honestly. Everything is bundled up and when I think about him I can feel my throat tighten and my stomach feels funny. So I’m going to talk about us just a little if y’all don’t mind.

His name was Atticus and this is lame but we met playing Golf With Your Friends on pc. We played i think it must have been 20 rounds of golf haha. He added me as a friend on steam and for the next few days he kept inviting me to play and at this point we still didn’t know who the other was. To me he was alcoholicvegan (he wasn’t vegan idfk where he got that name from) and I was mejicanpollo. Then he invited me to play realm of the mad god and from there we played don’t starve together and it was super frustrating to play without being able to communicate so we decided to add each other on discord and yeaaaa his voice was really hot. He answered the call like this “Hey man where do you want to set up base” and when I responded he said “ahaha fuck I’m sorry I shouldn’t have assumed you’re a guy I’m Atticus.” And it just went from there. On golf with your friends we had our region set to US so we got really fucking lucky when we found out we’re both from Dallas holy shit haha.

For a week we kept playing different games and sometimes we’d spend all night on the phone talking to each other. He was the funniest person ever and always made my day. It was super easy talking to him. I found out he was in the military when I asked if he wanted to play some cod and he said no because his job made it hard for him to enjoy those type of games. He said after experiencing it, he doesn’t like the idea of making a game out of something like that which is very understandable considering what he’s been through. That night we talked about the deepest shit and that’s when I started loving him. I went to a boarding school then and I was so used to talking to dumb immature guys. Atticus was very intelligent and he was educated in politics and just so aware of everything going on in the world. Of course that’s not the only reason why I love him. I could go on for hours listing reasons why but you guys get it. 

And yes I was pretty young...I was 17 and he was 24 but to be fair we didn’t know that until a couple weeks after meeting. And some can say that it wasn’t real love because I was too young but I can guarantee it was. Also, in Texas age of consent is 17 so it was legal and I was turning 18 soon. Also my sister was 23 and idk that made 24 not seem too big a deal

Anywaysss I loved him at that point and all I wanted to do every second was talk to him. Eventually things got a little complicated when he told me that um he has a kid. He’s three and his name is Elliot. His mom was a drug addict who was no longer in the picture so Atticus was a single dad. His parents were raising him while he was deployed until his contract ended with the military. I know the fact that he had a child should have scared me away but it didn’t. It actually made me love him more because he was an incredible dad. He loved Elliot so much and did his best for him while he was away and constantly planning for the future of his kid. He had made a 10yr plan for himself and Elliot where he had everything figured out including his career after the military, the private school he was going to put Elliot in, how much he needed to save for the next five years to buy a house. Like damn how could I not love him? Atticus was perfect. 

When I first found out about Elliot I tried to tell myself this shit won’t work but it didn’t matter how much I said it, he was too perfect to let go and even he told me that he tried convincing himself, but fuck it. A week later we met. He asked me out to lunch and my first thought when I saw him was damn he’s hot too. He was literally the perfect man and I couldn’t get over him. Our food took forever and he said something like  “normally I’d complain, but I don’t want lunch to end right now” which was really cute and again I fell for him even more. Afterwards he paid for my Uber because yea my parents couldn’t know I was having lunch with a 24yr old man I met playing golf online. (Sounds sketchy but don’t worry it wasn’t). We had lunch with each other every day that week and the next. Two days before I flew back to Oregon to start the new school year (remember, boarding school) we really wanted to hang out but he also really wanted to take Elliot to one of those kids reading things at the book store so he invited me and at first I was hesitant because it still wasn’t that real to me that he was a dad but I couldn’t help it, I really wanted to see him before I went back to school and so I went. And fuckkkk I loved him more. Elliot is adorable and they were so cute together it made my heart melt. Sadly the event ended and Elliot was really tired so they needed to go home. I didn’t really get to say bye to him but that’s okay because him being in dad mode was adorable and hot. 

Later that night he texted me and told me that he felt bad because he wanted to give me a proper goodbye and asked if there was anyway we could see each other before I left so I told him that after my parents fell asleep I could sneak out and we could go for a walk. And we did and we stayed up for a good five hours. We walked to a nearby park and just sat there and talked and I bitched to him about school and he just laughed at me the entire time. Then sometime into the third hour we kissed for the first time and once again...fuck I love him. He wasn’t pushy or anything he didn’t try anything more than that. It was the definition of a first kiss you know. That thing that happens in movies where everything feels perfect and your stomach goes crazy and you realize you love the person. Except in my case I already knew I loved him this just made everything official. So yea that happened and we never actually said we were dating until two months later. We were still a little hesitant with the age difference but yea eventually we just said fuck it to everything. 

When I went back to school we talked as much as we could and sometimes Elliot would even talk to me and tell me what he and his dad played that day. Unfortunately he was called back to wherever he was at and we didn’t get to talk as much. Especially because he (being the amazing dad he was) spent most of the time he had to call Elliot. So we would talk maybe once a week and that was hard until Christmas came and he was able to come home for awhile and luckily it worked out with my schedule. My parents were always working so it was easy to see him. We spent half the day with each other and every Monday Tuesday Friday and Saturday I spent the nights with him but it sucked because i had to be home by 5 so my parents wouldn’t find out. But luckily they pass out early and he lived 10min away. Honestly he spoiled me because sometimes I would refuse to get up so he would have to carry me to the car and sometimes he brought a blanket :’( what a sweetheart. We did this for three weeks and it is still my favorite Christmas. Those three weeks were fucking amazing. We had even said I love you for the first time to each other. We had known it for a long as time already but again the age and the fact that this was long distance made us keep it in for awhile. While these three weeks were amazing we had to unfortunately say bye again because I had to go back to school. It was a little easier this time because his schedule wasn’t so bad. We were able to talk more often and I was even able to see him when I came back for spring break but only three times. Everything was perfect and he even said how he wanted to be with me forever and he was so sweet and I wanted to be with him forever too he even got me a promise ring and he said “I know it’s dumb because and I don’t really understand them because they seem like not official but basically engagement rings but I really want you forever.” Of course I accepted it and for the next couple weeks we joked around because he called me his “not official but basically fiancé”. So yea it was perfect until he was sent to Syria and Atticus passed away. He went MIA for a while and it wasn’t until a month later that they found him and were able to identify him. The next six months were incredibly hard and I couldn’t deal with it. I did so well hiding my feeling during the day but would then spend all night crying. My friends barely knew about him because I felt like they would disapprove of the age so I really had no one to confide in but his sister that I had met over the Christmas break. We talked a little bit but she was so busy trying to figure out all that would happen with Elliot. I was alone and all I could think about was how he was alone when he died and how I wish I was there because I know how much he hated being alone. He always told me how he was not someone that was able to comfortably be with himself he would overthink things and just make himself sad. So I hated the idea that he was alone or with people that didn’t love him. I was at school when this happened so I missed his funeral and I ended up dealing with this loss all by myself even losing connection with his family and I never went to visit his grave because I couldn’t bring myself to do it. We had spent eight months together and I didn’t want to go see him when really all I would be looking at is a rock with his name on it. That’s not the last memory I wanted of him. I wanted it to be him jokingly calling me his not-official fiancé. Because that’s the last time I heard his voice. He said “bye I love you my not official but basically fiancé” two weeks before he passed. 

Two years have gone bye and I still think about him and I still cry over him. Atticus was someone that had his life all planned out and he always told me about things he was excited for and what he plans to do by certain dates and I remember everything so every time that day comes along or it should be around the time he told me he would do something by, I think of him and I start crying and I go into a depression for days or weeks. Today is one of those days. I talked to my cousin who’s five years old and started school this week and I thought about Elliot and how he’s five now and most likely going to school and how Atticus was so excited because he would be able to be there for his first day of school since he would no longer be in the military. And I started bawling and when I finally got myself to stopped I decided to go somewhere where I never went before and I went to his grave. And I sat there for hours and talked how I would talk if he was there and I told him about school and that I was in college now and how these past couple years have been so rough I wish he was here so he could make me feel okay again because fuck these last two years have been terrible I have gotten myself in a lot of trouble and I lost a lot of friends and I got kicked out of school and everything went to shit without him. I then talked about the good things and how my life has been so much better this last month and everything is going so well but the only bad thing is the fact that he’s not here. And despite all the shit I’ve been through in these recent years I have managed to get through everything but I can’t get over him. I’ve been with some people since but it’s not the same and I always end it with them because it’s not him and I constantly compare them to him. I know I shouldn’t and it’s not fair to them but I can’t help it. I miss him.

So I talked about all of this while I sat against his grave and and I still feel like shit and like I said I lost a lot of friends and don’t have many people to talk to about this because my parents know but don’t really care because they don’t understand that we loved each other for real. 

This was longer than I intended but it’s something. It’s the most I’ve ever talked about our relationship and I feel like I needed to. I need to validate what we had and yea. I love Atticus. I hate saying I loved him because I don’t care if he’s gone. I never stopped loving him. So yea I love him and I hope one day I’m able to love someone else like that because it was the best thing I have ever felt.",02Sep2019,13
33,"It’s not actually that rare that when I watch a movie about people my age or younger I feel like crap.
Seeing all these movie scenes where they have fun partying makes me realize how much of a loser I am, how stuck up I can be and it just makes me mad at myself! There’s a scene where Rosie ends up in the pool while wearing a white shirt and Alex tells her something about her being hot in that moment and for a split second, I wondering if I would be hot with a wet white t-shirt on but I realize that I wouldn’t, I’m too fat for that and have too much body imperfections (hair, acne) for it to be a hot me moment.
In the beginning of the film, Alex is a virgin and it’s seen as a disadvantage/flaw. And guess what? I’m a fucking virgin too, and I’m fucking (nobody) older than them in that moment of the film.. I don’t want to sleep with the first guys that I see just for the sake of not being that « loser » I am told I am, but I’m so tired of being insecure because I haven’t slept with (or even kissed) somebody!
And the last scene that made me feel miserable was when Rosie is at the beach with Cathy and they’re doing cartwheels. It’s so stupid but I’ve never been able to do a cartwheel, and during that scene my mind drifted away and I was back in primary school, looking at my friends doing cartwheel while I was just watching. I could have learned, I was pretty active at that time, but I didn’t. And I realized my problem was still the same problem now.. I never really tried. I tend to give up the second it stops being easy, even now.

35,"I don't know where is the better place to post this.

This is one of the day I miss my ex so much.

When I was strictly monogamous, I broke up with people with no real regret. One big compatible issue is enough for leaving without looking back. Other relationships ended in cheating (they did) and I hated them afterwards. I miss them sometimes, but it was easily to let them go.

I and my boyfriend turned to polyamory few years ago. Then I met another young man and we dated for 6 months. He liked me so much and wanted to try polyamory, but couldn't deal with jealousy. The relationship ended poorly when he cheated on me (dating with someone else without telling), but it was my opinion, in his he did nothing wrong...

I can not hate him. He's immature, he violated the rules, yes, but it's a long way for someone to go to understand polyamory and I can not blame him for messing up.

He said he will not come back to polyamory ever again, thus he's still thinking very dearly of me. He asks me for casual sex sometimes (which I angrily denied, I love him, I don't need casual flings). 

Then he got a new girlfriend, monogamous, as he wished. I congrats him. He blocked me.

In an email, he explained that the new girl never allow him to talk to me or meet me ever again. I wished him a good life. It was weeks ago.

Today, I miss him so much.

No, I will not bother him or their life. 

He's not a perfect boyfriend anyway. 

But I miss him, so much.",02Sep2019,3
36,"I’m about to turn 20 and things are just really uncomfortable at home. My relationship with my mother specifically makes my home life generally unpleasant, so much so that I work evenings to see her less.

As much as I love her, she is crazy. She’s the nicest person to everyone who isn’t family. She is always generally unhappy, she treats me like she doesn’t care about me, yet she is also terribly overbearing and controlling. She has never liked any of my friends, even if she never met them, just based on their looks.

She assumes I’m failing college because I won’t give her access to my college portal or email. She constantly judges my career choice (police officer) because she says I’m “naive, too trusting, and not threatening or willing to kill people”. 

She never trusts me when I go out. If I go to the movies, that means I MUST have snuck into a club. If I go to a friends house, I MUST have been drinking.

I didn’t mind when she decided to put a camera outside our house, supposedly to “know what’s going on around our house”. Once we got to 10 cameras around our small yard, I began to get critical. Now there’s a camera in our living room and basement, and it feels like a HUGE invasion of privacy, so I stay in my room.

I’m the only person in our house who doesn’t have a tracking app on their phone. I was in a literal car seat (not a booster) until I was 12. I wasn’t allowed to drive with anyone until I was 16, and the first time I did so, she texted me threatening that she’d know whether I wore my seatbelt or not, and that if I didn’t, she’d kill herself. 

The first time I had feelings for a girl, I was 16 and I decided to tell my mom in passing at dinner. BIG MISTAKE. When things ultimately didn’t work out I stayed friends with the girl, until we ran into her and her mother in public and my mom took it upon herself to tell her mom that her daughter was wrong for not accepting my date offer. I was so embarrassed, and our friendship was never the same. 

When I did get a girlfriend, she constantly told me “she was too fat” and that she shouldn’t wear makeup. Three years after breaking up with that girl, she still teases me about how I was willing to date “someone like her”.

When she gets mad, she gets destructive. She breaks whatever is in sight. I once asked her to help me pay the last $400 of my tuition, which led to a fight where she threw a glass picture frame at me, then punched me so hard that she bruised her own hand, then took a picture of it “for documentation”.

I’m at my end. My social life is close to dead as a result of years of being smothered and threatened. I haven’t been on a date in over two years because I know that she’ll try to get involved in that too. The only reason I don’t move out is that my dad and siblings are here too, and they have to deal with the same issues. If I’m not there to break up the fights, the cops will be at my house every two weeks. 

My dad can’t even fight anymore after over twenty years of dealing with the same thing. He does a great job of taking care of us despite my mom’s constant insults towards him. He takes care of us financially, and emotionally, and is involved in our lives in healthy ways.

And also, I really don’t want the financial burden of renting when I make $250/week(low rent in my state is about $1400/month). Even with roommates I’d be struggling. 

I know I just have to push through, especially for my sibling sake. Then, I can decide the kind of relationship I can have with her. But damn if it isn’t hard sometimes.",02Sep2019,4

40,"In relationships, a problem is often managing the household. 

I don't call myself a feminist, but it appears to be true that this is, in fact, a gender issue. While most women by now entered the world or work, they are still expected to manage the household. Now, there will be men who rightfully disagree, saying that they do their fair share of chores.

While this is true, women are often still expected to _assign_ the tasks to their husbands and kids. Example? 

_The wife asks her husband to get a fresh towel for the baby. He does so. He comes back, hands her the towel and goes back to his own stuff. His wife appears to be angry for no obvious reason at all later that day. The husband asks himself if maybe the towel wasn't right somehow? What did he do wrong this time? Why is she mad at him for doing what she said?_

_While her husband was getting the towel, the wife has already bathed the baby and carries the wet little one with her to get her some clothes. In the meantime, she picks up the dirty socks her husband overstepped for two days, including the time he got the towel. Yesterday, her husband took care of the dryer, but the dirty laundry next to it is overflowing and the clean cothes aren't folded. She's getting increasingly frustrated. The child starts crying, which reminds her of having to pay the babysitter by tomorrow._

The issues here are two. 

1. __Organizing an household is work as well as doing the chores themselves.__ And it's both - still - widely expected to be done by women.

2. __Many men feel attacked when their partner tries to communicate this.__ It's communicated as pointing something out that they _didn't do_ rather than an encouragement to take responsibility. In a worst case scenario, the man sees it as nagging. They are being constantly reminded of something they just didn't _see_, which there is an annoyance.

How come that men feel annoyed by their partner asking them to do things while women don't even want to ask in the first place, yet it appears to be a problem? 

Men are socialized to do chores and get pats on the back for it while women silently do what's expected from them. Meanwhile, the _work_ of assigning tasks and organizing things to keep the house running is __invisible__.

Now, how could we solve this problem? 

1. By making the invisible work _visible_.

""Thank you, honey, for doing the dirty laundry!"". Try to find at least three small things everyday of what your partner did in the household to be thankful for. Even if it was just throwing that thing away. Even if it was just taking her plate over to the kitchen. Try to acknowledge it.

2. By becoming more _relaxed_. 

""It's okay if these socks lay here."" Try to relax. Your house doesn't have to be perfect and it won't ever be. Approach things while staying more calm. Breath. There isn't any mustard for dinner and you will be fine. 

3. By working together.

Create a plan together, qhere you write down which chores need to be done and who does them. Like finding a day in the week were the both of you agree on which tasks you want to do this week. Maybe find more days, maybe every weekend, maybe every day before bed. Adjust this to your needs, but organize what needs to be done. Also, make exact plans of groceries together, before buying them and while being aware of what you need. This will also save you lots of money from buying things you most defintely barely need. 

4. Be prepared to fail hardcore.

Sometimes, things don't work out. People have bad days. Things go wrong. That's not the end of the world and definitely not the end of your marriage/relationship. Living together requires hard work, every hour, every day. And sometimes, the only possible thing is to say that you still love each other.",02Sep2019,4

I don’t have a super exciting “career” either, I’m just kind of coasting until I find out what I want to do.

54,"We've been together almost a year. He is a very honest man, he has told me things most people wouldn't tell their girlfriend (and maybe shouldn't?). He went through a period of doubts about 2 months ago. This mostly stemmed from the fact that he felt he didn't have enough time for his friends or sports and that occasionally he wonders what it would be like to have sex with other women (I'm his first). He was adamant it was only normal doubts and that he didn't really believe them, he's pretty sure he wants to marry me, he makes jokes about our future children etc. 

After he said those things, I've panicked over it maybe once a week and I hate that. He makes it obvious he loves me, he travelled several hours a week to see my this summer and he spent 4-6 hours a day with me in college. I hate how I keep taking things he said out of context and twisting them to mean something ""bad"". Like if he starts talking about how much fun he had with his friends I'll think ""oh he obviously prefers spending time with them than me, I guess they're more important, that's why he hung out with them yesterday instead"". I realise this is super toxic and I need to sort it. My boyfriend is very patient and always reassures me  but its not fair of me to think the worst of his intentions. I don't know how he hasn't gotten mad yet. It's worth noting I don't have any close friends anymore.

55,"This is a cross post from r/advice I’m completely and utterly stuck and I’m just having a rant right now. 


 I (19F) don’t know what to do. I am completely stuck without a direction in my life. I am the youngest in my family and I also have (fairly mild) cerebral palsy. I have no aspirations of what I want to do. I don’t have a job, the qualifications I have don’t amount to a career lasting job. I have a place at uni to start in September but I fiercely don’t want to go. It is a big financial burden for my family because I am not eligible for student loans. I am in the UK and there are no jobs where I live that am suitable for as I was in hospital from 16-18 when you’d get your first job and gain experience. 

I am stuck because I have never been the person to know exactly what they want and now it’s come to a point where nobody is telling me what to do anymore. This is difficult when you’re the youngest and have been told what to do your whole live. I feel like I don’t know how to think for myself. University is never something I have wanted to do but I have a place on a Business course. I feel this will be a waste of money because there is nothing I want to do with that afterwards. 

This may sound strange or odd but I never thought I’d make it this far in life, despite the fact that I have never been suicidal or anything, I’ve just always thought I’d never be an adult. I know that sounds strange. I am having a complete identity crisis and I don’t know what to do. I can’t keep doing nothing. I have no social life left because I am embarrassed of my life at this current point and I need to change it.

56,"In two days I (17M) go back for my final year of Sixth form and I'm dreading it. 

I don't think I can deal with the anxiety anymore I've already had do many missed deadlines for work that as soon as I go back I'll be doing nothing but being shamed by my teachers and being forced into working non-stop. I had some issues during the last term before Summer which I can basically sum up as a breakup that hit me way harder than it should have. I was weak. I didn't do hardly any work because of it. For weeks I cried myself to sleep thinking about everything I'd done wrong and now all the work I'd neglected is probably gonna get me kicked out of school. I'm a failure as a student and I fully accept that. On top of that my apathy towards thinking about the future means that due to the subjects I picked I have no marketable skills for the job that I've decided to go into which means that I'll most likely be broke and alone for the rest of my life. Everyone else has their shit together so why don't I?

I hate doing the same boring shit at school over and over again day by day, it's just all going too quick and I can't deal with it. I'm too afraid to die that I can't even force myself to commit suicide so I'll just have to live out my sad existence only to rot away forgotten and lonely. I can't do this anymore, and from the looks of things the future isn't looking bright. 

I just wish I could've seen that she wasn't for me. I loved her but she just stopped loving me. I remember it so clearly the day we broke up. She broke down because she was too afraid to tell me how she felt, I didn't blame her and still don't. I comforted her and said I saw it coming when I really didn't. At the time I sucked it up, acted strong so that she wouldn't feel bad, but I died inside. I told her later on how I really felt and that made things worse.

 I should have done my work, that's all this world is work, work, work until death. I should have learned by now that it's useless to fight against life, I should just let it drift me along, because ""it will get better"" right? I've heard that line from friends and family so much that it means nothing anymore. I guess I'm just trying to vent my frustration about my situation even though it's my fault, I should just try to live with it, I'm powerless to change anything.",02Sep2019,0

I went to university back in 2015 and did a foundation year in computer science. Due to me feeling terribly ill, I failed the year but passed some of my modules. I still retook the module by retaking the year for the failed modules. 

I passed those and then decided the university I was going to is not the best plan for my-self and applied at Coventry University. I did my first year, got through and now did my second. I thought I would have been able to go through but unfortunately I failed this year because of 1 single module and now I have no other option but to wait until January 2020 to retake the module with attendance and then go into 3rd year in 2020 September. 

I was looking forward to finishing my university completely next year so I can work and just move on. 
I am very tired of this course and my university life being dragged like this. It’s been 4 years and it would have been 5 years if I finished 2020 but now I will only graduate in 2021 which makes me extremely sad and constantly cry.

I am very disappointed in myself. Mainly my parents they want to see me at least graduate and I seem to be failing at this constantly. I am feel like the biggest failure to my dad and mum after they keep sacrificing so much for me.

Sorry this is long but there is so much in the middle of all these that’s been making me feel so terrible and now this on top. I just feel like I cannot seem to take a step forward and I keep being pushed backwards.

Then on Saturday I asked her out for lunch, and in the end we just got tea but she brought it up. And she wasn’t weird about it, and was completely understanding. Which is the best thing that could come out of a scenario like this. 

Plus, she mentioned that she was just awkward because she was selfish about the friendship and didn’t want to lose a good friend. I guess in some cases a good friendship is better than a marriage.

68,"Just under a month ago, I 30F left a 3 year relationship with the man I thought I’d marry, have kids with, and a “comfortable” life. 

Finding new friends on Reddit has been a HUGE part of my healing process, and I thought this would be a good place to share part of my story in hopes it could help someone else. 

Breaking up in your 30s can feel a lot different than in your 20s - especially if you want to have children some day. I made the mistake of staying with a dishonest partner because I saw his “potential.”

I caught him on a dating/social app when he went travelling overseas. We talked it out, he deleted anyone he met on the trip and we tried to move past it.

Things seemed ok in our relationship as time went on. We ended up moving in together. But, he became pretty defensive about his “space.” I felt he was really secretive with his phone, always placing it screen down, always taking it to the washroom with him. I had to ask to be invited to his friends gatherings a number of times. I caught him in little lies. I felt isolated. We’d talk, I’d feel better for a little bit, but he never really made me feel safe and secure, or even loved. 


Things just got worse. We got in an argument over the fact I missed a delivery at our apartment, and he got so mad about it he left to go to a different city for two days and gave me the silent treatment. I just shook and cried at home, wondering what just happened. When he came back, he said he was sorry and just wanted to move on. I was so emotionally exhausted, I surrendered. 

Fights like this continued to happen. Silent treatment. Gaslighting. It was always my fault. I was wrong for feeling sad he didn’t invite me to things. I was wrong for asking him to stay off his phone when we went for dinner dates. I was wrong for every human feeling I had. 

Just a month later, he ran off to a different city for the weekend, didn’t share his plans, where he’s staying, no good night text, etc. Finally, I lost it. I said I didn’t want this kind of relationship and I felt it was over. That he makes zero effort to try to do the littlest things to make me feel like I even matter. 

Honestly, I forget what it’s like to be with someone who loves me. I see my friends in happy, healthy relationships. And I knew I deserved better, but stayed for so long because I was too hopeful. 

After a couple weeks now, I’m started to not feel like my heart has sank. I’m staying with my parents until I find a new apartment, and saving up to furnish it the way I like. I’ve been feeling stronger everyday, reading stories on here about folks going through the same thing, and have lifted some of the anxiety of my timeline to have a kid. A lot can change even in 5 years from now, and it still wouldn’t be too late!

I guess my point it.. when someone shows you who they are, you have to believe them. He showed me early on he wasn’t a good, honest guy. To think more objectively about what is reality - and what is a “dream.” To ask those simple questions, “does this make me happy?”

76,"Jedi Shadow
Date: 9-2-19
(Inspired by SWTOR Jedi Consular Story)

The bright corridors, the vibrant gold and green tapestries, the monolithic structure, all of this gave form and voice to the name of the Jedi. In a few words: impressive, wonderous, curious, beckoning. Within the Jedi’s base of operations everyone went about, busy in their affairs. Studying, training, sharing their news, knowledge, and challenges. There is always much to be done when war is about. After the Sith empire’s assault on the Jedi temple on Corescant, no moment was a meaningless moment…

I was trained in the teaching passed down through this lineage. They explained the raw, mysterious power within me that is the force. It is not viewed as merely a weapon or a means to an end. The force is larger than one being. I was shown the self-defensive techniques of the lightsaber, a symbolic yet practical device. I developed as clay is crafted into a bowl or a decoration. I was granted form to my power. I was shown many things. 

However, it is obvious that these views about the force, what it truly is and how it should be treated, are not universally held opinions. There is the Sith, and there are the dark Jedi who turned away from the accepted paths. 

The Jedi over the years have tried to find ways to plan for this, particularly for the Jedi who fall away. We sought understanding of the darkness. Why did they turn? What motivated their changes? Could they return? Were they forever lost? Yet, here we are in a world recovering from war, with no assurance that peace will hold. 

	We have made a name for ourselves. The Jedi have assisted those in need, brought justice and fairness to difficult situations. The name, Jedi, is not without honor and historic success. But, the name is also not without blemish. We aimed for the highest ideals, and relied on the force. However, there is still much left to be done, and much left unknown.",02Sep2019,1

78,"When I was 13, I decided I’d study abroad. My parents were often too busy for me, I didn’t like my school at the time and just thought it was a great chance to start over and do something cool. Pursue my dreams. Get rich get famous or some shit like that. 

So I packed my bags and went off to the US of A. My first year in the states, I met my gf. We were friends first, and got along unexpectedly well despite being completely different people. 

A year or so later, I realised I was in love. We sort of fell into the relationship together, and by the time we were 15, we’d moved in together by getting housing through our school/programme. We thought we’d get married. I was working my ass off to stay in the US and get into a prestigious university. We talked about moving to California together, both attending our dream schools, living together and chasing our goals. 

But things were less than ideal. What do you expect anyway? The whole thing was a fat yikes, now that I have some hindsight. She was depressed and anxious all the time, and I often spent time juggling schoolwork, extracurriculars and work with her emotional needs. She wanted me to be successful and become the ideal version of me that she’d imagined. I couldn’t do that. I wanted her to give me stability and comfort, and now that I think back on it— I probably pushed her to be a person she wasn’t. 

We broke up in an explosive argument at 3 am, and now she’s with someone else. A guy who makes her happy. I’m not surprised. Now I’m in California, attending my dream school and at 17, I don’t know who the fuck I am or what the fuck I’m doing. My entire adolescence had been defined by who I thought was the love of my life and all the big dreams I thought I was gonna achieve with her. I’m not even sure why I’m in this country at all, because at some point, everything that ever motivated me all circled back to **her**.

After picking up some soap from a grocery store right next to the KFC (they're on the same block), my brother noticed a small spark almost like an explosion right between the restaurant and a grocery store. We were already in the car and I was already driving away. I immediately circled back and sure enough, the cables on the fusebox (not actually sure what it's called) on the building was on fire. 

It was a small fire (it literally started burning when I was circling back), but not wanting to take any chances, I quickly pulled up to an empty parking spot. My brother jump out of the car before the car even fully stopped and notified the KFC staff about the fire. The manager brought out a small fire extinguisher and they extinguished the fire. I called the local fire dept so that they'd investigate further but didn't wait around because my brother and I was still busy with our errands.

30 minutes later, we finished our errands and went home. I didn't realize that my body was full of andrenaline until my leg started getting wobbly as I got out of the car.

He's thinking about ending the suffering. He puts the barrel in his mouth. He cocks the gun. He has a change of heart. He's still an alcoholic, but he's alive. 

So the group leader is listening intently. She's an older woman, probably late 60's. Kind person. Former alcoholic. When he's done talking, she says in a very compassionate tone, ""Wow, I can't believe you got that close."" He says, ""Yeah, I had it in my mouth."" She says, ""And cocked."" 

This puts a mental image in my head, because I'm a bad person inside I guess. Here's a guy trying to end it all on the side of the road, with his mouth open. But some asshole comes up and keeps putting his *cock* in there along with the barrel of the shotgun. Tears streaming down the suicidal man's face. ""Please buddy. I'm trying to kill myself. Get your cock out of my mouth."" Camera zooms in on the face of the maniacal cockster, grinning, eyes wide. 

I cannot shake this mental image. Within a few seconds, I start busting up laughing. Everyone's staring at me like WTF man this situation is not funny at all. I felt really bad. Later the group leader asked me why on earth I would laugh about that story. I tried to avoid it, but she insisted I explain. She did not think highly of me from that point on.",02Sep2019,1

85,"21 M here. I never really took college seriously, but somehow managed to squeeze by in the first two years. Now i'm supposed to be finishing the third, but it suddenly hit me that i'm so far behind, that there is no way that i'll be able to do it. If i fail now, that's it, no more college for me i'm gonna have to find a job and move out. Which doesn't sound too bad on it's own, but my parents are paying for me to go to college (which isn't a ridiculous amount of money where i'm from, but its still substantial) . I already feel like i failed them, this would be a finishing blow so to speak. I have no idea what to do, i feel like my life is destroyed and it's all because of me and my laziness and lack of motivation. Apart from all that, i have absolutely no friends, i do have a girlfriend and she's a big help in all of this but she's on her way to getting a degree that will let her build a great career...why would she stay with me who can't even finish an easy college?

The notices kept going but as they kept going volume decreased until they stopped. Eventually the motion sensor activated light shut off which means no motion in the bathroom. I thought ""uhh.. is he dead?"" Then stayed there for 2 hours came out and yeah..

90,"This is gonna be a rollercoaster, I'll give some backstory so everyone understands.

I was in a polyamorous relationship with two other guys, one of which was asexual (Z) from Dec. 2018 to March 2019. They had already been dating separately for almost 5 months.

I broke off the relationship with both of them in March but got back with the other (E) the same night. 

The start of everything with E was great, he was loving, very affectionate, and paid attention to me. I did everything I could to be there for him and be the best girlfriend I could be.
He always told me how amazing I was, how beautiful and kind I was, &amp; how he didn't deserve me, etc. etc.. I felt so lucky to be with him.

Over the months, things got worse, we never fought or had any real problems or disagreements, we met up in person a few times a week to just cuddle and enjoy each other's company. 
But whenever I left E's house or wasn't with him physically, it's like he wasn't even my boyfriend.
I would text him sweet things and check up on him everyday after classes. He would respond hours later with such little effort put into any text. For example, he didn't even tell me happy birthday, and the day before I broke up with him, (Couple days ago) I poured my heart out to him and he responded with *""ok""*.

This crushed me, and I soon realized I was being treated as an inconvenience and I thought maybe if I just ignored the problem, it would go away. I mean, when we were together in person everything was perfect in my mind, but that was only 20% of the whole relationship, we barely saw each other in person. So our little meetups meant much less than before.

Then Z came back into my life- months after I broke things off and tried to forget him completely.

Z seemed to be a brand new person, he went through therapy and got all sorts of help, he spent the months without us improving himself. 
I started talking to him again, even though I still believed he was the bad guy (The break-up was messy to say the least, and I had heard all the horrible things he supposedly did from E).

I never told E that Z and I had reconnected, and I know if he would've known there's a possibility he would've been angry and confused.
I kept quiet, all while feeling awful and like a hypocrite. 
Z started explaining why he did the things he did (He was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, major depressive, and a few other things that really turn you into a different person).
He explained he had feelings for me and lost them for E, and that he wished he would've tried to keep me instead of staying silent and letting me run off with E. 
I was thrown for a loop, and the things he told me about E made so much sense, I started to understand the mess I had gotten myself into.

E was taking advantage of me being so kind, and covering it up just enough to where I wouldn't suspect. Z had partially invited me into the relationship expecting me to provide sex for E, since he couldn't himself and E was so desperate for his sexual fix.
I never expected him to be this way, especially since he seemed so sweet and we had such a long honeymoon phase. But the more comfortable E got being with me, the less attention and effort he put into our relationship. I knew what was coming next, but I ignored these problems and hoped they would go away, I got trapped in a fantasy and realized I had fallen in love with the idea of E- not E, himself.

So I started speaking with Z and I realized what I had done, I finally opened up about my current relationship at the time with E and slowly things unraveled. Z told me that I shouldn't be treated this way, and everything E did to him he was doing to me now as well. 
I finally revealed some of the text messages and things I do with E to some friends &amp; *everyone* sided with me.
I talked to Z and his current boyfriend about the situation and once again, everything made sense. I realized how much I defended him, how I allowed myself to be used in so many ways.

I grew up being a victim of my parents, being used by them and past ""friends"". I was so used to being treated so poorly I didn't recognize as a problem in my own relationship.

So I decided this needed to end, I already couldn't see a future with him. I was just waiting to get so addicted to his love that I could never leave. I could already see myself being absolutely destroyed over the years, and I knew his sweet persona wouldn't last forever. He treated his closest friends, his siblings, and even his mom like shit, while calling them all his *best friends* and telling me how much they meant to him behind closed doors.

I knew I would end up just like my parents, an unhappy future together, a nightmare, two people who can't stand each other staying together all while hating each others' guts.

I finally broke up with him yesterday, after days of crying and wondering if I was doing the right thing, as well as wondering why I didn't do this sooner.
Luckily we were only together 7 months, I didn't make any changes to my future, and it helped that he had nothing planned for his, I've finally dropped the dead weight that was giving me absolutely nothing.
Know what I lost by breaking up with him? Absolutely nothing.

Sure, I was in love, with the *idea* of him. But relationships aren't supposed to be the way ours was. I was unhappy and I was hiding it, begging for it to eventually go away. It was never going to go away, it was only going to get worse.
I'm lucky I had Z come back, he really saved me. He had been through the same stuff I was currently going through in his past relationship with E and he talked to me about it, supporting me the entire time. Told me I needed to do what was right for myself, that I was an amazing person and E took that for granted.


Here's the result of all this stress-
I've always been an anxious mess, anxiety is such a big part of my life that it determines my path, my friends, everything. Over the past few weeks I've been buried to the neck in work. Classes for 8 hours a day, putting a job on top of that (It was an acting job that drained me &amp; gave me panic attacks), and problems with E.

I was also worried E would find out about Z and I would be revealed as a hypocrite. Though Z tells me I'm not a liar or hypocrite, E has never been or acted interested in my friends or anything I do day-to-day so I'm *""not doing anything wrong""*.

I was up until 2 am Saturday night, bawling and discovering all of these awful things E supposedly had done while with Z, and unraveling the kind of person he really was, and seeing how he was starting to show it all while I was ignoring it and hoping it would disappear.

I went and spent the night with Z, hoping I'd feel safer and because I needed to talk. He picked me up at 2 am and drove me to his house, (There are a lot of messed up memories in that house, Z, E, &amp; myself used to hang out and spend the night together a lot when we were together.).
I was super hesitant and wanted to leave, and slept like shit.
The next morning we went and got coffee, and came back home, while we were sitting on his porch I got this sudden rush, my whole body went cold and numb, and I thought I was going to pass out or have a heart attack.
I went inside to lay down, but it didn't go away, he was super scared and I was petrified I was about to have a heart attack. My body lost all warmth and my heart was racing insanely fast.

I could barely walk without excruciating pain, I was able to eat a banana and a piece of toast and took my daily anxiety pill, suspecting it was a panic attack of some sort, even though I haven't had problems that bad since I was 8.

The rushes of coldness and numbness in my body terrified me, just thinking back to it makes my stomach churn. I had never been in pain like that, I'll never forget the fear.

I had him take me home and eventually it got so bad I had to go to the hospital- the pain scared the life out of me and it felt like I was moments away from death.
The ladies at the hospital were beyond amazing, they examined me and my heart and let me know it was healthy and this sudden pain was exactly what I thought, anxiety.

So they let me talk and I cried my eyes out, I told them everything that was wrong and they gave me meds for the nausea and anxiety and I left that place in zero pain, 45 minutes before I was crying and vomiting from the stress.

So now I'm here, recovering from this attack, my brain is exhausted, and it's a slow and steady recovery. I plan to allow myself the time to chill and to find ways to manage this stress so something like this doesn't happen again. 
The last few days have been hell- but it won't tear me down that easy. 
I hope you all are managing and taking good care of yourselves. Thank you for reading!",02Sep2019,6

When I was five, I was sexually abused by my one of my dad’s friends. I’m now 18F and the only people that know this are just five people, including my mother, but I just confessed to her that someone abused me, not who did it. I tried therapy but I don’t think it’s working (I’ve been going for over a year now) and im thinking of just not going anymore since it’s also very expensive. Few weeks ago I almost lost my virginity to a girl but when she began to touch my boobs I started to cry and shake a lot. I began to feel like dirty? I don’t know how to express it, but it was horrible. Then having thoughts that maybe when i was a child, It was my fault that someone did that to me because maybe i was asking for it? I’m just a mess right now. I can’t stop crying at night or whenever I have some alone time. The worst part is that my dad’s friend messaged him saying that they should meet soon (meaning that my family and his should meet for dinner or something).",02Sep2019,1
94,"Everything seems fine, but my brain won't register it as ""fine"". Actually, it won't register it at all... 

&amp;#x200B;

A good thing happens? - ""Nah, it's meaningless...""  
A bad thing happens? - ""Nah, it's meaningless...""  
An interesting thing happens? - ""Hey, tha... Nah, it's meaningless...""

The hell?? Why??

And it's not something that hit me in my teen years (18 now), in fact, I even remember begging my mom to kill me when I was 6 or 7... And nothing was wrong... I just didn't feel like being alive.

Also, I find people annoying... I don't know why. I even manage to be annoying to myself. For no damn reason... I mean, I have some friends, which are great people and I like hanging out with them, but it's almost like something snaps and I suddenly want to be alone.

Even though I don't like people, there's a person that I could feel comfortable being around. Her and I went to the same class from 2012 to 2016. We didn't talk to each other a lot, but when we did, I would feel comfortable and not annoyed. She made me feel like a human being. I wanted to commit suicide two years ago, but I didn't because I was optimistic. I thought we might spend more time together and be better friends someday. Of course, I didn't realize that I should do something about it, but I was ""lucky"" that both of us were invited to the same party five months later. Normally, I wouldn't go, because I'm not a big fan of partying, but I went since I was sure she would be there. I arrived to the place at around 8 PM. She wasn't there. 10 PM and she's still not there. I went and sat on a balcony alone, slightly drunk, thinking about texting her. I didn't know what to write, so I just sat there and silently cried. She and her friend arrived at around 10:30 PM. Damn, was I happy... I went to say hi, but again, we didn't talk much. In fact, I barely talked to anyone, so I guess I can say I talked to her the most. I was just thinking about how dumbly optimistic I was when I decided to stay alive, because, you know, a kid that barely talks to anyone (me) can be very uncomfortable to be around and gets bullied in school and then things can only get worse... And she saw all of it. So, yea... She is the reason I changed my mind about dying and I realized I was wrong about my hopes. The next day, when I calmed a bit, I decided to write something of a poem... A cringey one, of course, but it also *kinda* precisely described how I feel. So I thought it would be a good idea to send it to her. I sent it to my best friend first to get his opinion about it. He said it was good and even made him cry a bit (either he didn't read it or was just messing with me). Then I sent it to her... I was shocked to what I did and immediately turned my phone off. Three and a half hours later, I turned it on again and saw her reply (what it would literally translate to): ""\[my last name\], did you cut yourself?"", which would mean ""are you crazy/what's wrong with you"" or something like that. We never spoke to each other since then, but I've seen her a couple of times and cried every time. Just as I cry myself to sleep every night.

You see that part above this? I told myself I wouldn't write such a long part about her, but she's literally the only person that made me feel alive and actually gave me a will to live. No one and nothing else ever made me feel that way. I know I'm just a dumb 18 yo, but my whole life since I could think was about wanting to die. And she made me change my mind. And I really liked feeling alive. And now I'm back at wanting to die. 

But everything seems fine. I have friends, both parents alive, happy and well (actually, my dad has diabetes, but he takes a really good care of himself), most of my teachers and professors said I have a great potential, elders say I'm very polite, a decent amount of my friends said that I'm the best friend they've ever had... So where's the damn problem?? Why can't I feel?? I'm interested in many things and activities... History, SF, football, military stuff (tactics, gear, weaponry, armored vehicles...), swimming, running, cars &amp; bikes, memes, music (mostly metal and similar stuff), IT, comedy, philosophy, fishing, hunting, foreign languages, photography... But everything lasts for a short time. Nothing makes me wanna stay alive.

One of my friends knows all of this (the dude I asked if the poem I wrote is good). But he believes she (the girl I wrote that long part about) is the reason why I am like this, which is not correct. As I already wrote, I'm like this since I was 4, maybe 5 and I was 11 the first time I met her.

The hell is wrong with me?? Why do I wanna die??

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I can't seek for a professional help, because my mental health needs to be perfect if I want to get a job, and I need money. So maybe later... If I live, of course.  


TL;DR everything's fine, but I wanna die",02Sep2019,2
95,"As someone correctly pointed out a couple of days ago, my family will always be a part of American history. There's always going to be questions people want answered that nobody is going to have the answers to. There will always be someone that didn't know something about their own family. Even I don't even know the entirety of the story. There's always going to be a third party desperately trying to change the narrative and reality of the situation. I'm not on the run, in hiding, or under the protection of anyone. These are the beliefs of people with wild imaginations. People seemingly get away with their deeds until everything is verified and confirmed. It's been this way for years. Nobody escapes the pendulum of counter-action. Not yet, anyway.  

I find it ironic that the trucking industry is willing to give me a job now. What exactly changed since I first applied? What compelled this change of corporate mind? Why is the game industry still peddling this idea that I wish to work within it, when I don't? Are we stuck in a multiple dimensional situation and you people are dealing with another copy of me? I hope I don't run into him as we won't agree on anything.  

The truth of the matter is that I've taken my recuperative rest from being homeless for about four years and I now want to get my life back on track.  This includes paying off my debt, getting proper medical evaluations, and all that. Living in a car or on the street for a few years can really wipe a person out. At one point I was working two construction full time construction jobs. 

I will not be taking part in this secretive behavior that everyone seems committed to. I'm not James Bond and my family did not handle that sort of thing. It's all a Hollywood tale with no real life equivalent. So if you think you're going to send a secret message my way and continue to play this childish game, I will ignore you. If it cannot be said plainly and openly, then it's not worth hearing or reading. 

California has some of the best technical and engineering schools. This is a well known truth. Contrary to rumors and speculation, I did not run away from California and there isn't anyone looking for me. Aside from a small handful of confused and agitated individuals, I'm on great terms with everyone down there. So if you're an ex-girlfriend and you want to get back together, you will have to message me directly and say hello. I don't know where you live or have a means of contacting you. 

Some of you 'niggaz' know me very well. I am a fish out of water up here. I lived in Southern California most of my life and that's where most of my memories are. That'd I would be afraid of the place is irritating, but funny. And yes, I know you guys/gals in Los Angeles are good people working hard towards change. It's why I decided to stand up and help you out. Not much help, but you know.

I left to get away from that situation in Upland. It was like the movie Groundhog Day. Same situation over and over again. These people need to move and on and find another focus in their life. Constantly screwing with me will be their downfall and this has been established as the truth in the past. 

This situation is much like the one America is in. It will take a team effort to restore normalcy (getting my life back to the way it was) and it has to be done by people who truly want to see it done, and by those who genuinely care. If you're an old friend from my pre-military days, don't hesitate to say hello. I've changed but not too much. Mostly good change.",02Sep2019,1

98,"So I've been trying to write this for a long time, and hopefully this will be the last time I write it.

My name is Hunter, and I am currently 18 years old. Now I won't say that I've had the most terrible life, but for me, it completely messed me up mentally for the longest time. My dad had never really been in my life for more than a few months at a time, with most of them being around a week or two. He walked out on my mom and I when I was around two years old. He had always kept saying that he wanted to be 'around' yet anytime he had the chance, he never was. Many of the times, it would be something small like a baseball game, or just to go out to eat, yet these are the things that meant the most to me. Other times would be him calling to come and pick me up, and as a five year old, it filled me with joy, and would run to my room to get my things together. I thought of all the things we would do, and what I would tell him about myself, as if I thought he cared. It would always be the same story, me waiting by the window for him, then my mom getting a call from him cancelling. Of course, being so young, I didn't understand, and would cry for the rest of the night. This continued for about a year until my mom had enough and told him not to ever call unless he \*\*knew\*\* he would get me, or even not telling me he called to not get my hopes up.

Around seven years old, we moved into his house out nears the woods, which seemed like the coolest thing to me, I got to hang out with my dad, and see all the animals around our area, and be happy. Or so I thought. Once again, he was never around, so I still never saw him. He would leave at night saying he'd be back that night, but not returning for about a week at a time, usually strung out. My mom did what she could to keep me from it, but it was difficult in our situation. After a few months of us living with him, we decided to go move back to my grandparents for the time being, which my dad didn't like. He got very aggressive and started yelling at my mom. This terrified me, I had never seen him like this, (He has terrible anger issues, which I sadly got from him). I tried to calm him down by saying 'Dad!' and all he did was turn to me and yell ""Shut up! We're Talking!"" so I started crying, and mom got pissed and started yelling back at him. He eventually got so angry that he grabbed onto the riding lawn mower he had on his trailer and flipped it off of it, and landed about a foot away from hitting me (Will come back to). My mom grabbed me, and we left. This was the last time I have ever seen him in person.

At ten years old, my mom met a man, which eventually became my now-dad. He adopted me right after they had gotten married, and had been my only father figure for my life. Now he may not be the best person, but he does his best and tries his best to raise his kids (two boys and a girl). After the adopting, my 'dad' tried getting ahold of me, and wanted to see me. At the time, I was on a little league team, and had a game coming up. I told him where and when it was, because I wanted to give him one last chance. He said he would be there, so I got excited for it. When I got to the game, I told everyone on my team, and my coach that my dad was coming. As usual, the game had started, and I was waiting to see him somewhere in the stands. I saw my mom get up and walk away with her phone in her hand after a few minutes. I knew what happened, he wasn't going to show up. Needless to say, I had a breakdown at the game, and ended up having to leave early because of him. That was it, that was the last straw for me, I never wanted to see or hear from him again, which I made very clear. I wrote him a letter, essentially telling him to f\*ck off and never contact me again. We found his address and sent it to him.

At sixteen years old, my life had been going amazingly, I had started a new job, had a great girlfriend (which I am still with) and was taking my mom out to dinner just to have a day with her. During our drive, my mom got a call, and answered it. It was my 'dad'. He wanted to talk to me, so my mom had asked me if I wanted to talk to him, so I took the phone. He tried to apologize to me about everything, which of course I didn't want to hear. I told him if he had truly knew he had messed up, he would've done something about it before, but he never did. He immediately tried to offer me a car, but I'd have to come and meet up with him for it. I told him what I thought to be one of the most important things I had ever said in my life, ""I didn't need you for the rest of my life, what makes you think I do now, or ever will?"" He tried to make a bunch of excused about how terrible my mother was to him, and how she kept me from him, which she never did. She would always give me an option, which I never said yes to anymore, and when I did, I made it clear to him it was his own fault for him not following through with his promises. I started yelling, and became very angry, I started shaking and crying very hard, so I completely snapped at him. I eventually told him how I felt, and before he had a chance to respond, I hung up, and have never heard anything from him since.

The only good things I've ever received from him are my three siblings that I have from him and a few other women. Two of them I keep in touch with, one who I grew up with, and her little brother which I had just been able to meet with two years ago, and try my best to see them on a regular basis, since they are only two hours away from me. The last child he has, I have never met, and really hope one day that I can. I have no idea her name, age, or even who her mother is, but maybe one day I could find her.

Maybe I could have given him a chance, but I'm honestly too scared to ever try again, because I've been hurt too many times from his lies. I can hardly keep friends at this point because of him, it's nearly impossible for me to trust many people, or to let anyone get close to me.

I cried a couple times trying to write this, but I do have many other things that have happened in my life, if you would like to hear about them, please let me know. Thank you so much for letting me talk about something so difficult in my life that I've talked about.",02Sep2019,11
99,"This past Thursday the guy who assaulted me on a bus was sentenced. His sentence was a joke. This is seriously an evil person.

I was riding on a bus, when this guy comes on and sees a girl he obviously knows from somewhere. As soon as she sees him, I could tell there was a look of fear on her face. He goes and sits down beside her and says ""Hey bitch, where ya been?"" She starts to act really defensive and starts apologizing, saying it was her fault, she's sorry, she'll be with him, etc. The entire bus was uncomfortable.

He starts yelling at me, calling me a fucking punk, I don't know what's this bitch has done to him, I don't know what he's been through, I should mind my own business, etc. I'm really scared at this point so I apologize to him and tell him that yes, I should mind my own business and move to the front of the bus and call 911. He sees me take out my phone and runs up to me, asks me who the fuck I'm calling, and starts wailing on me. Before he can be restrained by multiple people, he manages to give me two black eyes and a broken nose. I literally feared for my life.

It should be noted that we're in Canada and aboriginal justice reform is a major thing here. Apparently the guy was high on meth, grew up in an abusive home, his mother went through the whole residential school thing, etc. That's what his lawyer was arguing: ""poor guy he had a tough life, therefore he's allowed to be a total trash human being."" They also argued he entered in to substance abuse programs, is clean, is doing job training, trying to find legit employment, etc. He ended up getting 180 days imprisonment, 5 years probation with a lot of conditions including him continuing his addiction treatment and perusing his education and employment goals.

This is total bullshit. This piece of shit is obviously abusive to this girl, makes a scene on public transit, and beats the shit out of me making me fear for my life and ultimately, his life is going to be improved because of it. He gets treatment, job training, etc. instead of punishment. I read a lot on reddit about how great Norway's hotel prisons are. I think that's total bullshit and you probably would if you were a victim of one of these crimes. Why doesn't this piece of shit deserve to spend years in prison, then get out and only be able to take the lowest of the low jobs because every employer will be able to see his criminal record and what he did? Ultimately, his life is probably going to be made better, not worse because of what he did and I just think that is very messed up.",02Sep2019,1

102,"I've been living alone for 2 years now , im 17 , for economic reasons my mother works abroad so im forced to stay like this , my parents are split up. I grew up in an really unquiet house , it has given me anxiety (not gonna say it's diagnosed , it isn't and im not gonna act like it) but it sure does feel like everything is so hard to do. I can socialise 1 on 1 , if i know the people in a group i can go up to 3 , but the moment theres 4 i just break , i can't talk speak up a word , i turned out an invitation from a girl i like just because there were 4 other people we were going out with. My self esteem is non existent. Theres alot of stress with having so much responsibility so early. I'm in an arts highschool , which does 2 days of drawing/sculpting whatever per week and the rest are normal classes. I think it was a bad idea to go to , but my parents went with it because they had other bigger problems when i chose my highschool , and i was just a kid when i chose it , i still am but still. ""What do you want to do?"" what was i supposed to say i liked drawing so iwent for it , i even started guitar , but i never seem to be happy with what i do , i always think ""this is shit"" be it singing my guitar or drawing something which hits my self esteem even more. I'm not happy with my body image either. Because im in a drawing kinda class theres like mostly girls i get so many comments about my body and they really aren't nice. I play them off on the moment but i don't like them.Before leaving to highschool i had a really good friend , i and her would talk about any kind of problem as freely as we could , it was always the place id take things off of my chest , but she dumped the whole friendship we had when i left. I just don't know how to contain this anymore , i've been crying alone but it just doesn' t help . And even tho i have some friends that i could talk to . I always act happy because that's how i've been taught , people needn't see your problems. And even when i attempt talking about everything that bothers me i can't because i keep telling myself inside myself ""No ,they'll see you as a lesser person if you show your weaknesses"" that sounded kinda angsty but still.I just wanted to gt this off my chest , i don't know if this is the right place to post . I just searched for ""Rambling"" subbreddit because i just wanted to talk to someone , not really talk but i wanted to know someone somewhere sees my toughts . If you read all this thank you :D . Im not a native speaker eitehr so i might have done some mistakes.

105,"sorry about the terrible formatting, i dont care enough to fix it rn.

I dont know where else to post this but im almost at my limit. My mom has been getting worse with her anger. I heard her scream from the other room and i ran to find out what happened. Apparently she ""almost cut her finger off"" (she tends to exaggerate things) and my dad was trying to help her by telling her to apply pressure. For a little background my mom is well known for not being able to go through stressful situations well and starts to panic. My dad started to try and apply pressure for her but got the wrong finger and she yelled at him telling him ""THATS NO THE RIGHT FINGER"" and ""I'LL DO IT MYSELF"". i told her it was ok and i know it hurts but you need to calm down so he can help you. I guess she didnt like that because she yelled at me saying i wasnt helping and to ""shut up"". I dont know how im suppose to do this anymore if she cant keep her cool in these situations.

she just came in my room and apologized but still blamed me. HOW TF IS THAT AN APOLOGY??",02Sep2019,1
106,When my friends start talking about politics or anything that “matters” I just zone out and can’t contribute. I wish I gave a shit about that stuff but deep down I’m just apathetic and think everything is too fucked to change just by me caring about it.,02Sep2019,5
107,I don't know how it really started but it just hit me. I used to be a straight A student but my grades started to slip to the point i've failed a couple classes. I skip school around twice or thrice a week. I gained weight. I feel more and more unmotivated. My parents work hard to provide me everything i want but i just cant seem to be happy or do something good with the opportunities i have.,02Sep2019,1

110,"I have really bad self esteem and i’m used to all my friends leaving. I have selective mutism and don’t make an effort to go out and talk to anyone. Maybe i’ll give 1-3 word responses to someone when they talk to me first but that’s it. 

When people actually come up to me it doesn’t feel genuine. I feel like i’m not an actual person, i’m just there. 

I have one irl “friend” but I haven’t seen her in months cause she goes to a different school. Even when we did go to the same school we didn’t talk much. She spent a lot of time on her phone or talking to others. We still text daily and she asks to hang out but I always make up excuses for why I can’t. I feel horrible for pushing her away like that but we don’t do much when home are together, it’s just kinda awkward. We have nothing in common anymore, we’ve been friends since 4th grade. 

I have a few people online who are nice to me but I don’t understand why. There’s nothing very interesting about me. All I do is complain. I never know what to talk about.

My dad is the only person I really have yet i’m mean to him. I stress him out. I always want to miss school which just makes him yell at me. I’m only 2 weeks in I shouldn’t be missing yet, or at all. I’m a baby and can’t deal with something as simple as school. I have no motivations for the future, I only go for him. Also i’m 15 and can’t don’t turn 16 for 2 months. I could drop out then but I would need his consent.",02Sep2019,3
