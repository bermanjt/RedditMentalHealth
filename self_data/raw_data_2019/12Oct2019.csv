0,"I apologize in-advance if this post ends up being long. Just gotta get something off my mind, and I wanted to see what other people thought.

I've just started seeing a counselor for my PTSD. I was in a minor car accident last year, and have had a rough time dealing with a concussion, whiplash, anxiety, depression, and also taking time off of my undergrad program. The reason why I thought it would be best to see a counselor, was because I don't feel comfortable talking with friends and family on how I feel or have been doing. 

Before the accident, I was a workaholic; and loved going to school, freelancing, and my social life was great. I did have some rough, stressful moments, but I always kept it to myself, and never got anyone involved, because in the past, it always backfired, or been told that they had ""their own issues"" to deal with. Even my parents are hard to talk to, because they tell me to not tell them when I am feeling pain from my whiplash, or I'm depressed, so that's why I turned to counseling. 

I have gotten so used to keeping everything inside, that it's weird to talk about myself with my counselor: I know it's their job to listen, and come up with ways to help me get over my anxiety, depression and PTSD, however, I feel guilty and embarrassed every time I cry during a session (I always apologize too). I had my last session earlier this week, and my morning didn't start out well, so I was already upset before out session. I was balling my eyes out, and every since then it's been bothering me that I shouldn't have cried.

TL;DR: I have PTSD, anxiety and depression from a motor vehicle accident that occurred last year. Decided to seek counseling to help me recover. However, I always feel embarrassed whenever I cry during our sessions, cause I don't know if it's normal. I've gotten so used to keeping my feelings/ stressors to myself prior and during my recovery, that it feels weird to talk to someone still, and cry about it.",12Oct2019,1

16,"I'm gonna just list them all here, get them out and over with because there are plenty. No particular order at all, just sprawled around and getting off my chest

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'll start with an intro, than what made me decide to acknowledge this, followed by what I'm gonna do, and how to fix it.

INTRO:

I'm currently 15. I guess am kind of an omnivert, but spend most of my time playing video games. I do well in school, although my motivation to do anything there is nonexistent. I think I have ADHD, can't concentrate for shit, but my dad doesn't believe in it, so  getting tested is near impossible even with divorced parents. 

I rage sometimes at video games, a lot more recently than ever before on any game. IDK why but I get mad at myself when I do poorly. Chances are its just another manifestation of my insecurities. I base my whole self esteem off of how people see me, and thus I want them to see me as someone good at video games, even though nobody really cares. 

Recently, it reached the point of me throwing things. I have 0 impulse control so no matter how much I try to stop myself in advance, when I get an impulse to do something, I do it. Today I broke my headset over just a fun game with a friend. I got mad at myself for no reason when we were just having some fun and doing dumb stuff. It's the first time I've really damaged something beyond repair, and honestly I'm just dissapointed in myself. I gained nothing from doing it and yet I couldn't stop it.

I'm also struggling a bit with family stuff. My mother is going through a new job, and really stressed, and I want to be around her for that but also don't how to/want to because she's usually stressed out and we don't have too much in common. At my dads house I sit in my room most of the day, even when I work out and don't talk to him much because I don't want to but also feel like I should. For some reason though, I recently haven't wanted to connect with my parents much but feel like I have to and need too. Every time I think about it I feel like a huge asshole

Topping onto this, my entire social life feels fucked as well. I feel like I annoy my friends at some times, and they don't really want to talk to me a lot. One of them in particular can be a total jackass even if I'm not annoying him. He'll punch me for any reason sometimes, seriously. But, when he's in a good mood, he's a great person to be around

As for my personality, I don't know what the fuck it is. I change depending on who I'm talking too, and try to be someone they'll like to an extent, or I'll just be myself. My brain does this shit automatically. I range from cold and not really talkative to chattering nonstop and having conversations. I genuinely have partially lost who I am in all of these mixes, but the closest to me is when I'm with my friends over the internet. 

I'm still going so hold your horses:

Occasionally, I'll get anxiety through the roof for seemingly no reason. I'll think that I'm going to die, or just sit down and realize that one day I will die, and contemplate whether or not I'm wasting my life, or what it will be like when I'm gone. The main anxiety thought that happens during these weeks is what would happen to the people I know if I die now. What it would do to my family, to my few close friends.

All of this fuckery has come together into a lot of issues that I don't talk about with anyone. I mention it to my online friends sometimes, but that's it. Usually when it comes up I'll just laugh it off and pretend I'm not actually struggling with it at all. 

Honestly, there's even more to talk about, but it's the really personal shit and I'm not putting that on reddit at all because I'm not comfortable with it being out there.

So, as for what I can do? 

Well, for starters I'm taking a break from video games. It's not them that's the problem, but I'm still not going to play them because they can trigger some of mine. I'll replace the headset even though its expensive asf, and I'm not even going to lie about how I broke it. What's the point?

I don't know how the hell to tackle everything else. I feel like getting ADHD tested would be a start, but I don't want to further hurt my relationship with my dad. Last time that I MENTIONED it to him he got really mad and even talked about going to court over it. He would never forgive me even though it's not wrong and I know it. 

As for my situation with friends, and personality, IDK. I feel like just being open and honest with them from now on, and dropping my sarcastic and kind of offensive facade that I have up around them.

The anxiety is mostly out of my control. I'll just assume it's related to my ADHD because occasionally ADHD goes with some light anxiety.

That's all I have. I don't know why I type my issues up on reddit of all places, or why at all, but I'd like any advice you have or any tips/ideas/insults. Not even fully comfortable putting this out there, but it's gotta go somewhere.",12Oct2019,2
17,"A couple of years ago I had automated parts of a certain workflow for the sales team using a cloud service they'd contracted with before I was hired. This summer, out of the blue, my workplace cancelled our contract with the cloud service. Sales team made a fuss because my solution was working well for them. Luckily, the assistant director of IT wanted to see if we could do it in-house.

Finally had a real kickoff meeting today with the stakeholders. I was a little nervous but I got their requirements. I have the scaffolding for the coding project setup. Now I just have to do the customizations. Sales team were talking about how much time I would save and how the faster workflow would get them sales from less patient clients.

This project isn't being managed by my boss, who I don't like because of his neediness and general incompetence. There's also another project coming up, not managed by my boss, where I'll be doing similar automation.

21,"Seems more recently I’m getting off on the wrong foot with acquaintances at work or with making appointments and the like.. For example, I didn’t know that after getting ur hair done you should keep seeing that stylist. (I was 18 when i first went and was still getting to know adult etiquette for stuff like appointments, bills, etc) 

I didn’t know this so whenever i went to the same salon i saw a different stylist...(they were all amazing!) i would lose their numbers but i didn’t know it was such a big deal? Anyway the salon is best at cuts/washes so i made another appointment, only this time the stylist answering my call was short with me and only had availability almost 3 weeks later in the afternoon.. i doubt they are really that busy?? 

Same thing when i saw a supervisor for advice but I was late because i couldn’t find their office and profusely apologized..another person had an appointment 15 minutes after me.. he didn’t know what to do and eventually just saw me for 5 minutes and was very irritated I didn’t end up getting the help i needed from him...It was still really early and i didn’t pick up cues that I should ask to reschedule

My question is, should i still go to this appointment even if I know they don’t like me as a customer anymore?  

Does anyone else have this kind of issue with picking up social cues? Could this be happening recently just cause I haven’t been sleeping well at all?",12Oct2019,1

25,"My girlfriend is psycho. She is a total sweetheart and the love of my life one moment, but at the flip of a switch she turns insane. It can be anything, and it happens every time we’re on a call or we see eachother, especially on phone calls.

I usually say something wrong. She gets really quiet and hangs up/stops talking to me. She then expects me to get her to talk to me, after which she screams at me, tells me she hates me, that she doesn’t love me, that I’m the reason she’s depressed. It doesn’t sound like much but it hurts me so much. If I turn off my phone she tells me that she’s going to kill herself. I know she won’t, but I always come back because I know she’d get even angrier if I don’t react to that.

Whenever she gets mad at me I shut down. All I care about is getting her not mad at me and I do anything she wants. The only way that doesn’t happen is if I get angry, but if I get angry she gets sad and makes me feel bad that way. 

She’s conscious she does this. She feels terrible about it when she’s not upset with me. When she is upset all she wants to do is hurt me. 

I know this doesn’t sound bad at all. maybe someone better at dealing with this stuff would do better. this has just been happening for over a year and a half at this point. it’s absolutely destroyed my mental wellbeing. and for some reason, even though I know she’s abusive, I can’t get out no matter how much I will myself to. 

I’m not really looking for advice. I just don’t have anyone to talk to.",12Oct2019,5
26,"He came over to my party after being at a frat thing earlier, so he was pretty hammered already. Then he drank more at my place and inevitably got too drunk and needed to lay down. 

Normally I *hate* taking care of drunk people. Friends, my exes, random girls at the party, I’d always do it but I’d be gagging and resenting the person the whole time. Not their fault (okay maybe it is cause they chose to drink so much but whatever) but I still have always despised caring for drunk people. 

But tonight I was more than happy to bring him water and paper towels and trash cans. I was completely fine rubbing his back while he vomited. He was apologizing over and over cause we were gonna go out to bars with friends but he was obviously in no state to go. I honestly did want to go but I’m not holding it against him one bit. 

Now he’s sleeping next to me and I’m just on my phone in bed. I changed out of my going out outfit and took off all my make up - sure I’m a bit bummed out. But overall I’m just happy he’s safe and comfortable and hearing him breathe deeply next to me is oddly comforting.

40,"Hi all! 
I am turning 26 soon and most of my friends are in college and we live in a college town. I’m fine with my friends drinking or whatever but I don’t and I often feel bored at “parties” where drinking and talking is the name of the game. 

I just don’t know what to do where all my friends can be engaged in something together and still have a fun time celebrating Me. 

I really wanna have a silent disco but I don’t have a venue— tbh I just like loud music and dancing, but to my own music that I like hahha. Art night sounds fun but not a “party”— same with board game night. Drinking games (with water) are fun but I’m just afraid people won’t have fun without alcohol. 
It’s already winter where I live so outdoors stuff is mostly a no-go and I’m allergic to everything so ice cream party, pizza crawls, etc are not possible. 
My friend group is made up of pretty disparate groups too, so it’s hard to bring them all together. Also, my apartment is teeny tiny. I can find a different venue but it super depends on what we’d be doing. 

I don’t know. I’m not much of a partier but I’ve never had a celebration that has felt right. Maybe I shouldn’t plan anything and just chill out. Ugh.

45,"So I am 23 and haven't had a single friend in the last 7 years and never had a girlfriend. Never went on a date, never kissed, never went to a party etc., for the past 7 years my life has been like this: wake up, go to school/university and spend time alone/talk to nobody, go home and watch youtube/go on reddit and sleep. I am lucky that I am doing well in my degree, mostly because I don't want my parents to be dissapointed.

Most of it come from lots of bullying in my childhood. I changed schools when I was 14 but even though the people where nice to me, I somehow just shut down and developed heavy depression and social anxiety to the point I am not even able to share my thoughts with a therapist. I was lucky that some girls in my classes where interested in me but I was too scared/too ashamed of myself to move it forward. Online Dating also doesn't work or rather I never tried and too afraid too try because first, I have no pictures of me and no friends who take pictures of me in natural settings. Secondly, I would still have to eventually meet a girl face to face.

So last year I managed to work on myself, I went to a gym and got in good shape and right now I am in a better mental state. Next step I want to tackle is to go out and socialise more. For this I went through the university page and picked out courses which I thought were interesting.

For this semester I picked 3 different dance courses (lindy hop, salsa and a ""basics of different dancing styles"" course). Also I will go play badminton 3 times a week. So 6 times a week I will be out there talking to people. I thought about also joining a boardgaming night but I think 7 times a week socialising will be too much.

Anyways, I am sooooo scared of next week. For this whole week I feel like I have to vomit. I am already thinking about if I should come earlier or exactly on time. If I come earlier, I would probably stand there awkwardly with the teacher and the few people who are there (if at all) because I can't do small talk. If I come exactly on time, everyone will look at me when I come into the room. I am really scared of young people in general. I am afraid that I will be seen as the ""loner"" or ""quiet awkward guy"" or worse be seen as a ""creep"" in the dances courses. I am also afraid that I will not be able to talk to anybody and just stand there awkwardly on the site. I am so afraid that I will be bad in the dance courses and my partners getting frustrated with me.

What I am most scared about and have been constantly thinking about is, what if I get to know people, make friends, we hang out and then they will find out I never socialised in the past 13 years and never had a girlfriend. It is not like I will ever tell people but people often talk about relationships and might ask me when my last relationship was and I can't lie because I am a very bad liar.

51,"Sorry for the long text and for formatting, I am posting from mobile. TL;DR at the bottom

I (26f) have been in a relationship for 3 and a half years. I am pretty sure it was an emotionally abusive relationship, which caused a lot of distance between me and my friend group for two reasons:
1) I had very limited time for them because I just kept trying and trying to fix all the broken pieces of this messed up relationship over and over again
2) my friends said they just didn't wanna watch all of it go down anymore and said they couldn't help me because I would keep defending him and not listen to them. So they distanced themselves

Well, about half a year ago he broke up with me. It took a surprisingly short time for me to figure out that that was one of the best things he ever did for me.

But of course - and I fully admit that I messed up big time - I regretted causing a distance between me and my friends. 

I still had met with some of them of course - but rather rarely. So I tried to make amends and rekindle my friendships.

Now, in the time I was hardly there the friend group had included some new members. One of them was a guy (27m) we will call Aaron.

Aaron and I kinda hit it off pretty quickly and started a kind of fwb-situation. Although I gotta admit, over the course of time (some weeks to months) I did start to like him.

After some time of going out with the group again I met a girl we will call Beatrice. She absolutely hated my guts from the start when she started seeing me hanging out around Aaron.

Now, he kept denying there was something going on between the two of them when I asked him about it. And Beatrice kept being highly hateful towards me.

Now my friends got really annoyed with me over the course of time and I didn't know why.
Until one day when Aaron admitted he was hooking up with Beatrice this whole time and was lieing to me. He also said he thinks the rest of the group is kinda annoyed with me as one of them apparently told him, but he didn't know why (turns out he knew very well).

When I asked the friend I am closest to in the group about that she admitted that something along those lines had been said but also told that that was because me being there seemed to bother Aaron and Beatrice. Those two would then always be talking and making fun of me behind my back. Right before or after a night when he would hook up with me again. The group just got tired of this situation. 
On top of that they said they had been sure there would be no talking to me about his actions because their experience was that 'when you like a guy, you just won't listen'.

Now as a result, I am uninvited when Aaron and Beatrice are there so no one feels uncomfortable. 

I feel like shit and super lonely. I know I made mistakes in the past but I wish they had given me the chance to prove I learned from them.

TL;DR: lost most of contact with friends because of ex; tried to rekindle but got excluded again because of a guy. Now I'm lonely and devastated",12Oct2019,2
53,"Might be long, TLDR at the bottom.  

Also might be the wrong place for this post l, forgive me if that’s the case.

Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile. 


I’ve suffered from depression in the past so I can say with confidence that this isn’t that kind of deal. Recently I have been out of contact with my friends. 

I have tried to get their attention by asking them if they would like to hang out or catch up, and they’re either uninterested or they forget about it. In the beginning everything was fine. People get busy, people have lives, it’s cool. This was different though, I began to go without seeing them for weeks at a time. Something to note about me is that I have very few friends, and this isn’t because I can’t make friends but I prefer to have a smaller circle. It’s more of a quality over quantity kind of thing. I have been close with this group of friends for a while which is why I had no reason to doubt their actions.

Recently my birthday passed. I always made an effort to remember everyone’s birthdays and try to do something nice for them as I know how nice it feels to be appreciated. We all come from pretty bad upbringings, so I want to make sure that they know they’re appreciated. It’s easy to forget sometimes. Speaking of forgetting, not a single person checked on me to wish me a happy birthday or at least say they were thinking about me. I know it sounds like I’m being a whiny bitch but it just hurts when you already go weeks with no contact and now on a day that’s important to me, I don’t get a single message or a call. 

Speaking of birthdays, one of theirs recently came up and they threw a party. But surprisingly they talked about me to my girlfriend who was in attendance, now they didn’t say anything bad which I appreciate; they just asked about me in general. The thing is, they have my number. All they have to do is call or text, but they don’t do that. It just makes me feel more isolated that this entire group is hanging out without me and I don’t understand why. 

I’m sure you’re probably thinking, “There’s no way they just up and ditched you. You’re not giving us the full story OP. Maybe you’re a shitlord.” 

I can tell you that I’m just as out of the loop as you are. They always described me as being a funny, responsible, and caring guy. I was always the one they called when they needed help or advice, and in turn they would do the same for me. They helped me through a lot and I have helped them just as much. I’ve fed them, given them places to stay, and I have given them the clothes off my back. I’m not looking for praise, I just don’t see why I need to be done dirty. 

I get that nobody owes you anything, not even an explanation. I just really would have appreciated one. Even if it was to tell me they just don’t like me anymore. It would’ve stung, but at least I can rip off the mental band-aid instead of letting it get infected. This isn’t the first time it has happened. Not with this particular friend group but I have been slowly let go over time by other groups as well. 

Maybe there is something wrong with me that I just can’t see? I probably have to do some self reflection. 

TL;DR - I’m afraid my friends are slowly starting to let me go and I can’t do anything about it. I’m just tired of it.",12Oct2019,2

I remember being so wild, and rude and mean in her class, but she always rebuttal with a kind heart, soft voice, and her heart broken eyes would show disappointment how I’d act. It always made me “stop”. I realized I was doing this , for some form of attention? Anyway, I had a dream about her at that time. I was in her class room sitting in the chair, a single light chimes on me, and on her and she looks at me and says “You’ve got to learn to control your anger.”  For years it’s haunted the shit out of me, because since then I’ve been doing the opposite of what she told me to do. It’s fucking crazy. I have no life. I want to become something, with someone, I want to see everything. I want to be real, and free, and true. I want to spread love, not fucking hate.

I have confidence that I can do any job I’m trained for, but that doesn’t stop me from being worried about all the things that can happen and go wrong, even to someone new or to someone who is great at their job this stuff is going to happen and I hate that feeling of unknowing and being uncomfortable.

The truth is that I was only dating them because they were the only source I had for weed (I was a weed addict for several years and dating them was a perfect excuse for me to keep smoking, plus I lived in a small town and getting your hands on weed wasn't easy). I was fully aware of every thing I did to this person and how I played with their emotions especially when they started to develop feelings for me. Fast forward 2 years into the relationship and I had to call it quits. There was so much arguing and every day that went by felt worse because I never saw a future with this person and yet I was still using them for my own selfish needs. After calling it quits I went for about 4-6 weeks of NC. But then I did some thing even more horrible which was that I went back to them and told them I wanted to try and work things out again, (I lied) because in my mind I was 100% sure that I didn't want a relationship with them. I wanted a joint and wanted to have controll over the situation again. Being the good person they are, they agreed to give it a second chance. Two days after that I just couldn't take lying to them and myself anymore and told the truth, which ofcourse resulted in a second heart break for them. Honestly I feel really bad that I don't feel any guilt for what I did. I don't know why. I am a shitty person. I knew this was going to happen from day one but I did nothing to stop it because I was selfish and didn't care about anyone's needs but my self. I don't expect them to ever forgive me for what I did and wish that karma would get me one day just so I can feel they're pain and what I put them through. I wish I could help them but it's too late and anything I do know will send mixed signals and make things even worse. I lost a good person, a great friend, all because I didn't love them and never had the guts to be honest about it because I was using them for the weed, for company, for secure and just for having someone to talk to since I have no friends.

He went out on last night and didn't even bother to tell me he made plans. He ignored my texts and phone calls. He said he was upset we have been arguing and just wanted space. He came home at this morning at 6am drunk. I knew something was up. 
I went through his phone (i had never gone through it before) and found out the he's been cheating on me for months. With a bunch of different women. He's even on a bunch of dating sites saying he's single. Apparently he even told his friends he broke up with me, a couple of weeks ago. I took the liberty of texting all the women and his friends that he's a liar and a cheater. I couldn't help it.

I paid the bills, took him to his appointments, helped with chores, and etc. Finding out he's been lying for months, it's an unbelievable pain. I told him I knew everything and told everyone the truth. He just said ""yeah we're through"" and that he ""was never hiding anything"". I couldn't believe it. I had know idea who he was. 
I don't know when he turned into such an asshole. He was so sweet and caring when we met.

*I think it's true for most people; Whether it was amazing or horrible, people remember their feelings from their first time doing/experiencing something for the rest of their lives. And that's exactly why I can't imagine it. Being with someone who, at least once, already completely devoted and gave their whole being, heart, body, heat and love to some random stranger. Those feeling won't ever fade; no matter how good, painful or bad it was it will be forever connected with that one, irreplaceable somebody.*
