0,"I ask for an opinion. 
Some guys in my school are used to make fun of me, about my appearance, linking me to perverted jokes about  sexual acts/ practices. I often saw staring at me and whispering things like""she won't escape"", ""she is asking for it"".  In recent weeks I eavesdropped on a conversation  and heard them laughing about me and planning about how they will ""catch me.""
On the same day, not so much after this conversation, I heard again sth linked to this: ""She deserves it"". 
Some people think it's only a joke that some teenagers that ""fell in love with me"" make,because they don't know how to express their emotions, but I don't think so. It's exaggerated to make rape-jokes about the person ""you fell in love with""

&amp;#x200B;

In Jan 2018 I've got devorced, after living together for almost 4 years. I've initiated devirced as I wasn't happy in the relationship due to constant drama and arguements and way to much control from my partner's side for more then 6 month. Nothing helped to improve the situation. Even though it was my decision, it was very hard for me and I was trying my best to not let my emotions out at work. Couple days after I've decided to devorce, girl from work asked me why do I look so sad? Let's call her ""C"". I was in good relationships with C, she is a nice person with wounderfull personality, but with her own problems. I have decided to open myself to C and I told her how I felt and how broken I was. I found out that C was in a simmilar situation to me and she has also broke up with her partner, so we just spoke for hours and I felt so much better next to her.

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly we have started seeing each other every night after work and at some point I felt in love again. I was so caring  and  I would always try and surprise her with flowers, strawberies(she loves them) and what ever would make her happy. It was great, I felt like she is in to me, we would talk, hug and kiss and it all simmed to be great. After two weeks C went on Xmas holidays with family and we would still talk every day and every night, I was almost sure that she is a person I need. 

&amp;#x200B;

After C returned back from holidays, I've noticed that she has changed a bit, she didn't want to see me even for 5 minutes and I didn't know what have I done/said wrong, C said that she only wanted to spend some time with her sister and other family members and they wouldn't be happy if she would see me during this family period. I've kind of accapted it, even though I couldn't understand why this would even be a problem? 

&amp;#x200B;

We kept seeing eachother after work and on weekends and she would tell me alot about her self and I felt like I'm finally getting C's trust and one day she told me how much she loves me and she has never felt anything like this before. After she said that I've melted inside and I told her how much I love her.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later We went to house party, her ex fuckbody (let's call him S) was there (my work colleague), big drama and tears and all different shit took place, as S spoke to me previously and told me that I shouldn't be with C as she would hurt me because this is what she does to all her boyfriends and this what she was doing to him and this why they never acctually been into proper relationships. Obviously C didn't like this chat. They fell out, rly bad. She told me to stay in the basement with others while they talk upstairs. After 15 minutes I went upstairs to check if everything is ok and I heard voices from the bathroom, she was talking to S and she asked him to kiss her. I've walked in while they were kissing I looked at them and walked out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't speak to C for a few days. She felt rly bad and she appologiesed alot saying that it was a BIG mistake and how much she loves me and how she wants me back. So I forgiven her. things went back in place we would talk, kiss have sex occasionally. I've spoke to her about S, she said that they will stay as friends only and I have nothing to worry about, she promissed. A few days later she said she will go to see S for smoke with him and she said that I have nothing to worry about as they are just frineds she promissed again. Next morning she texted me saying she had sex with him, also she told me she had sex with S that night when she kissed him...

&amp;#x200B;

I was super mad, but I've managed to calm my self down, as I had to go to work and see HER and HIM. I felt like she is just playing with me and I didn't know why?! 

&amp;#x200B;

We had a chat again and she has explained her mental problems and how she couldn't control her self and that it just happened. I was aware that she has problmes, but I didn't know that they can affect her decision making that much... 

&amp;#x200B;

Guess what, I forgived her again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now she told me that she can't be with me, before she sorts out her previous relationship in full. Even though she loves spending time with me, she needs to talk to her ex boyfriend, let's call him ""B"". As she keeps thinking of him, even after all that shit that he has done to C. So they will meet this Saturday and she will decide what she is going to do next. After all this, there is a chance that she will go back to him... She said.  

  

Why am I even into those self harm relationships? Why do I let her hurt me and play with me like If I'm 10? Why am I being such a blind idiot? What am i doing wrong?

3,"Background. I'm a junior in college. I dropped out when I was a sophomore due to depression,anxiety and agoraphobia. The only time I left my house from 2013 to 2016 was to go to therapy appointments. When I reapplied in 2016 only enough credits transferred to make me a freshman again. I graduated community college and now am in my second semester at a four year school. I'm doing better with my anxiety. I've been able to get by by just showing up to class and acing test and doing assignments. The most I had ever studied at a time. Was maybe an hour. But regardless my GPA is a four.

This is the first semester where I've had to actually try and it's giving me extreme anxiety. I am studying for hours a day just to keep up. That's normal. I see people working so much harder and they can do it Without having panic attacks. People work hard everyday but I when I sit down to study I get this funny feeling in my stomach. When I'm not studying I'm constantly freaking out.

My mom has this issue of parking straight into the back of the house because then she would have to reverse it backwards and look through the back so she would always drive the car onto the lawn and turn it around so when she leaves the car would be facing towards the road. This evening she decided to move the car across the lawn to make it to how she liked it and her car got stuck on the mud (keep in mind this has happened before and we had to get another car to tow it out of the lawn). Once the car got stuck in the mud, my dad came upstairs extremely mad telling me why I didn't I move the black car forward (even though the car was forward enough for the red car to go through). I told him I had moved it forward, maybe not extremely to the front but that there was enough space for the red car to park right beside the black one. I had taken a picture of it and took a screenshot on my phone.

&amp;#x200B;

I went downstairs and he's using a wooden plank to get the tire out of the mud, meanwhile my mom is standing there watching and saying how much of a degenerate I am, and how I always make stupid mistakes and everything is my fault. My dad then decides to tell me how much of a failure I am and its always my fault, and no one deserves a son like me.

(These comments may seem out of nowhere, but they have always been telling me these statements ever since I had been kicked out of my major and have been failing my classes as I have  always been skipping them and sleeping 14-16 hours a day. I am much better now and am attending classes, so it really did come out of nowhere to still tell me how pathetic I am).

&amp;#x200B;

I then lost my nerve and told my dad that hes broke and ill-tempered and hes a pathetic loser and a bum and how everything is truly his fault, not mine. I told him that they could team up and blame me all they wanted, but at the end of the day, I am no longer taking it and it is THEIR FAULT for being broke and getting evicted (as they were evicted from NYC because my dad started fighting with the landlord and telling him to go fuck himself). I stood their and yelled at them telling them it's THEIR FAULT, not mine, the car got stuck in the fucking mud because they have this stupid fetish to reverse and move the car around the lawn because they're afraid of driving backwards, its not because I hadn't moved the black car forward. I also said I have enough money to move out and I don't have to take their shit.

&amp;#x200B;

After I made those comments I went upstairs and just laid in bed. After about an hour and a half they managed to get the red car out of the mud and my mom kicked my door and started calling me all these names. She called me a loser and how it's all her fault she raised pathetic trash like me. She didn't parent properly that's why I'm such a fuck up and a degenerate. She also compared me to a bunch of success stories, and then compared me to the kids that work with her that have a higher GPA than me and how fucking stupid I am. She said no one deserves a trash son like me and I'm an ungrateful bastard that could've been stuck in a third world country (we are immigrants that came to the USA for a better life) and I should understand their suffering and how easy I have it. I would've been stuck in Bangladesh around a shitty environment, instead thanks to my Dad I am living in the USA having it easy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to tell her that I also struggled, since we had moved over 5+ times from school to school I was always the new kid. And how kids would trip me in the hallways, and call me names every chance they got. They kicked my basketball into the urinal, flung rubberbands at me, emptied bottles of hand sanitizer into my backpack.. She then told me that I am so critical and entitled that she's not surprised I had no friends, and I still have no friends because I am a bum and a degenerate. I go to college and come back and don't socialize and have zero friends because I am a loser and I deserve it.

&amp;#x200B;

I just laid in bed and said nothing. She said that without them I AM NOTHING, I am worthless trash, and the worst thing god could conflict to them is give them a child like me.

If I hadn't spoken to a therapist(on campus) and listened to lectures of Jordan Peterson the past, I swear this would've been the final straw and I would've just fucking offed myself right now.

13,"I've been dating my girlfriend for quite some time now. Eventually, I moved out of my parent's house into her moms to help out with their small time business, but the basic dilemma is this: Her little sister has had a rough time growing up being diagnosed with various forms of depression, ADD, OCD, PTSD, etc. Her mom tells me that a lot of these come from her father, who I have heard several scenarios about. The little sister recalls one of which her father and some other man were standing over her in a dark room at a young age, which the general presumption is some sort of sexual abuse, which wouldn't be surprising because her father has already been charged with sexual assault of a minor. She has also drawn pictures in Pre-K/K of her dad with a gun. Past her childhood years, visits with her dad are not pleasant either. On documented notes from truancy officers, he has said things like ""you're never going to get away from me"" or ""you're never going to get away from me."" 

After attempted suicide from my girlfriend's little sister, the dad stopped trying to go to court. It's been quite some time since that has happened and he now wants to go to court again. The mother (who I am living with) believes that no matter what, the general consensus among the civil court will be that he will have monitored visits once again, and that this will put the little sister into another state of distress. Thus she thinks her only option left is emancipation which would be through marriage. Up until I've come into the picture emancipation through marriage seemed unrealistic because nobody would do it, but now she believes that since I am living here I am a viable option.

Coming here I told my girlfriend I was willing to go through with it because I cared for her little sister. It seemed like she has had a shitty past. But I gotta say, after moving in and seeing that her mother is not the most mentally stable person who is constantly disrespectful towards me and my girlfriend, has emotional breakouts, and is overall delusional in a lot of circumstances, I am hesitant with going through with it. Her mom aside, I do not not know the full story because I am obviously only hearing from people who 100% hate her father. I also don't know the legal risks and what the father can do on his side. I feel as if now since the situation is relevant again since the father wants to go to court, I am being bullied by her mother into marrying the little sister. Overall, If someone could outline the risks both legally and amongst my girlfriends family as well what yall think the best course of action is from here I would be very thankful. Again, I care a lot about my girlfriend's little sister, I am just lost and feel pressured. ",06Feb2019,1

i recently applied to my town community college and i’m really nervous. see i went to a college in my town for one semester and i completely failed it. i failed so hard they kicked me out. i got super depressed while i was at this college, made no friends and my parents forced me to live on campus which sucked. i was miserable there so i ended up never going to classes, never doing any work and staying in bed all day. i am hoping this doesn’t cause me to get rejected by the community college. i took a year off after that because i felt i wasn’t ready for college and just worked and did adult stuff. i got my first apartment and am engaged now. i pay bills and budget and stuff. i even got a cat. 

anyway, yeah i have anxiety about whether or not i’m going to get accepted. i don’t mean to sound like i’m self centered but i know that i’m smart and have a lot of potential if i only tried! i’m now ready to try and give it my all as i really want to go back to school and feel more productive throughout my day. i’m tired of coming home from work and doing nothing but playing video games/watching tv. i want to do something more, something better. also i want a good job and to quit working at this stupid minimum wage job i have now, and a degree that i can show off and prove to myself i can accomplish something. i want to shove it into the faces of all the people who have doubted me and didn’t believe i could do it. 

this one is a little more sadder but i really want friends. i want new friends and a friend group that feels more like family. i have some friends maybe 2 good ones but they are guys(also they go to college in texas so i don’t see them ever) and i really want some girl friends that are around my age. i want people i can text all the time with and to hang out with and do activities with. i’m really hoping i can meet some people at this community college if i get accepted. i would love to be in a club and study groups. i know i’m not extroverted in any way and i’m terrible at interacting with people but i want to get better and i want to be an outgoing person with a bubbly personality. i just need to put myself out there and force myself to participate and practice.

18,"I don’t know what is wrong with me. I’ve struggled with depression for years. I never sought help because I always just hoped I’d be happy again. Getting out of bed is a struggle, not because I’m tired, but because I am emotionally drained. On the weekends, I will literally stay in bed and not talk to anyone. Laughing, even smiling take so much effort out of me. 


Why am I so angry inside? My anger is ruining my relationship with my boyfriend. He’s put up with me for so long. I don’t even realize how lucky I am to be with him. He’s primarily the reason I want to seek help, but he doesn’t know that. 

The littlest things set me off and I don’t know how to appropriately handle it in situations when I’m around others so I bottle up until I’m alone. When I’m alone I just explode. I scream, but I have neighbors so I have to put my head in my lap and clench my jaw and fists really tight and scream through my teeth so much my throat begins to feel like it’s on fire. I punch and slap myself in the face. I bite myself until flesh is torn. I like to press the bruise at times and feel the little bit of pain. I occasionally cut myself on my palms because those won’t leave scars. What the hell is wrong with me?

I’m not suicidal. I never think about killing myself. I think about dying. How I wish I could die. I wouldn’t mind if a drunk driver struck me, ending it all right there. Or being at the wrong place at the wrong time and killed in some drive by or some guy just decides to off me just because.  

I don’t know if I have some undiagnosed mental illness and this is why I am this way. Maybe it is just depression or maybe I just have serious anger management issues.

24,"Right: Fairness means everyone plays the game on the same field, following the same rules. If the game is lopsided as a result, so be it.

Left: Fairness is an equally matched game where everyone has equal opportunity, so handicaps are necessary to adjust for disparities in various advantages.

Right: But who decides what the disparities are and how much to handicap?

Left: Most people are well-meaning enough to be honest about their needs. We could listen to what they think will help.

Right: It's preposterous to have fairness be decided by the losers. We should do away with handicaps completely. It will motivate them to play better. Otherwise, they won't put in a good effort.

Left: Based on what we've seen, some of the game's disparities cannot be compensated for with any amount of motivation. What you're proposing is only fair if you pretend that isn't the case. It's demeaning to work twice as hard when you'll still never be able to compete.

Right: Why should those who are better have to stoop down to people who clearly haven't done the work?

Left: Not everyone was born in a situation where they had the time to learn the game like you did. Besides, the game shouldn't be just about winning. Winning is good and all, but is it worth it if it was a cakewalk and nobody else had any fun?

Right: That's just the nature of the game. We're fine with it. What gives you the authority to make all these decisions for everyone?

Left: If you want to play anything at all, you're going to have to consider the participation of the other team. Pretending you can't or shouldn't do anything about that is probably going to result in the end of the game for everyone.

Right: You're just trying to scare us into playing your way. Come up with something less manipulative.

Left: It's just the moral thing to do. It's a shame that you won't consider our opinions or feelings.

Right: There's nothing in the rule book that says we should. We didn't get to where we are by playing that way.

Left: That's because the game as you know it is actually kinda new. And your side wrote the rules without consulting us.

Right: What are you talking about? This is how it's always been; as the creator of the game meant it to be.

Left: Even if that were true, do you really think the creator foresaw all the changes that would happen over time? A lot has changed. The rules you refer to don't seem to reflect modern reality. Keeping the status quo actually seems like a bad idea, given the circumstances.

Right: If we start bending the rules, we're going to end up with an even bigger mess.

Left: You just like the rules that way because they benefit you.

Right: Is it our fault that things panned out like this? Don't we get credit for playing the game the right way?

Left: We understand, but these days we have the knowledge and ability to make a new game that's more inclusive and fair for everyone. Standing in the way of that seems selfish and uncooperative.

Right: You just want to diminish all of our accomplishments and make a big mess out of this great game!

Left: We can't do anything without your help. We're trying to get your buy-in. Wouldn't it be better if everyone enjoyed playing -- including you?

Right: We don't trust your intentions. You're going to rig the rules in your favor. That's how it always happens.

Left: I know it seems like we are against you, but we really want what's best for everyone.

Right: Of course, that's what the creators of the last failed game said. We don't think you know what ""best"" actually is. What if what's best for everyone is to just leave things as they are?

Left: *sigh* We really don't want this to get to the point where we have to force the issue, but we will if we absolutely have to.

Right: Are you threatening us? You better not be threatening us. Now we are certain you don't have our best interest in mind!

Left: You want to play the game, right? We're trying to be diplomatic. We've compromised up to this point and it really hasn't improved our situation.

Right: What are you talking about? The game has never been better!

Left: Maybe from your perspective, but that's not true for everyone who plays it.

Right: If that's true, why are more people playing than ever before?

Left: Just because they're playing doesn't mean they like it or are successful. Have you considered that they don't have any other options?

Right: They made the choice to play. If you're on the field, you have to compete. You can't expect the other team to just give you the win.

Left: Look, we're trying to warn you about impending doom caused by the very game you insist on playing -- in the way you play it. If you refuse to respect that, we might get to the point where we will stop trying to get along and start making our own game.

Right: Again with the threats! See? You're not as magnanimous as you say you are. Hypocrites!

Left: *sigh* This is what you get when you base the entire game on competition and not cooperation.

Right: Eat it, losers!

Left: Real mature.

She and I clicked pretty well and she expressed interest. We had been flirty but platonic for a while, but she had a very close guy friend for about a year, and I was never sure about their status as they were off and on so I never asked her out. This new years, she sat next to me at a party with a bunch of  friends, including her close guy friend. She and I cuddled for a bit, on the couch and she was very touchy and flirty, but nothing serious. I asked her out on a proper date after hearing she and her ex had just broken up, and she was giving off very heavy signs to me. We have been dating for almost a month, so a VERY fresh relationship but after about 2 weeks, she began texting me short replies or just not responding for 3 hours in the middle of fast-replying conversations. She stopped being as flirty as usual, and she stopped being touchy, like she is often towards me. I'm not sure what this means but it feels like our spark died out in just 2 short weeks. It feels like she does not want to talk to me or go around me without friends. I'm not sure how or why but it was very sudden. Should I tell her that I feel like she's been different? Is it maybe because i'm in a wheelchair? She never seemed to mind, and it doesn't impair anything about me except for my ability to go on stairs haha.

tl;dr : New girlfriend of one month (I know, fresh af), suddenly stopped being flirty and acting like herself, and does not seem like she wants to continue our conversations or make plans, what do I do?

29,"With NBC taking over and all, people were pretty excited for S6 of B99 because it was orginally cancelled. NBC is running it right now for a whole 18 episodes to test the popularity, but I feel like the experimental decision is ruining the TV Show. I'm not sure why, but I'm less interested in the new episodes in S6, and they're getting less and less laughs out of me. I dislike how Gina went out on the latest episode, and feel like there was much more they could've invested into her exit. I mean, during the regular episodes, her one-liners are better than the ones in her exit. I feel like the show is trying to be super insipiring and have amazing morals, but the attempt at that is killing the comedic aspects. 

Overall, I believe that B99 S6 could be fantastic but the ""Should we or should we not?"" that NBC is debating in between is straining the fun.

For now though, I'm going to continue to support it in hopes for a banger S7.",06Feb2019,1

31,"Toxic feminism. 

There are only two subreddits I consider toxic and cannot stand: The_Donald and AskWomen. 

I've tried multiple times subscribing to AskWomen, hoping to give them a chance to share the female mindset with a few of my curious questions. I always soon unsub after due to not finding any worthwhile content. But I so want to understand the female mind besides vague answers like they're more emotional because I've seen a lot of the common conception doesn't seem true to me. A lot of guys are emotional. In addition, women suck at communication. I hypothesize the way they are brought up greatly influences how they interact with the other gender. And I think we live in a different time where traditional gender roles are obsolete and we are in a transitory state. Our society is going through lots of changes. 

Anyway, each time I've asked a question in AskWomen, I've felt berated, mocked, dismissed, and insulted by 95% of the answers. So I don't post there very much. My questions may be elementary, but I'd rather see less defensiveness from all demographic, and more sharing of each other's needs through communication.

As I early as I can remember in childhood, I have struggled with low self-esteem, body image issues, and I was always an extremely picky and healthy eater with weird food habits. I have dealt with severe anorexia nervosa for the past ~8 years. I’ve been in recovery for nearly a year (in April) and relapsed from about August-Thanksgiving. Since then I’ve been back on the wagon and doing really well with eating at least 3 well-balanced meals a day, as well as straying away from food rituals and behaviors. I’ve also been trying tons of new foods for the first time and expanding my palate beyond my “safe foods.” I was just lying in bed hungry and craving a Big Mac (which I recently tried for the first time ever) and I went and got one because I wanted to. It sounds simple but it has taken so much to get here. It’s a ridiculous and irrational illness that’s really hard to understand but it’s real, it is the most fatal mental illness, and it’s not a choice. My eating disorder has held me prisoner for ~8 years and I finally have control again. I’m enjoying every bite and I’m really proud of myself.

He wouldn't get a job in Hawaii because there wasn't much employment and he's disabled in the jaw I started to use marijuana as a crutch. Senior year I moved schools two times because of a toxic relationship with a girl. Mom hated her job in Hawaii so she decided to move to Arizona. I went to California to live with her friend for a year until college. I then went to Florida for college but dropped out the within the first two months. One of the teachers started cussing me out and that was it for me. Drove back to LA from Florida was homeless for a month before moving into my grandpa's boat. Got a job detailing cars for 2 months, quit and ended up selling my $6,000 car inherited from my dad to go to Bali. I dreamed of having a career in travel filmmaking and content creation for brands. So I packed all my camera equipment at 19 and got a plane ticket to Bali. Turns out I couldn't stay there for long before running out of money and my passport runs out. The place was amazing though, very different from Hawaii but still beautiful and exotic place perfect for photographers and YouTubers. I was trying to find a place to stay and my mom recommended I stay with my aunt in Tennessee. Now I'm living with her and have quit like 3 jobs already some wasn't paying me correctly and one I just didn't like.

My husband's friend flew from out of state to be there. We picked up from a city two hours away a few days ago. We took him back to the airport today. Or at least we tried. We got about halfway then hit black ice. Went off the road and hit the guard rail/cables in the middle of the interstate, took out a couple posts and the front of my car is damaged. Looks like just the headlight and some cosmetic damage but no idea. A state trooper stopped a few minutes later and took us to the next town since it was too dangerous to wait at the car. Told us it could have been a lot worse as there had been four fatalities earlier and on the way he stopped next to a car that had rolled down a hill. They were fine, thankfully.

Called my dad because I don't know what the fuck to do and my uncle came to pick me up, so he could get a look on what happened (he's a mechanic, the only good thing about this). He was also nice enough to take husband's friend the rest of the way to the airport, who just barely made his flight.

Things aren't good... We just don't have the money to deal with this. My job requires my car to work (delivery driver), and I've been low on hours for a few weeks as they shift people over. I don't know if I'll be able to make rent. In fact I'm sure I won't. I don't have a car and don't know if I'm going to get it back. I can't borrow husbands as he needs his. My husband will cover me but he doesn't have a lot to spare either. I have no idea what the cost of the car will be, the insurance will only cover the damage done to the guard. 

Husband was driving and he's been blaming himself and won't believe me when I tell him I'm not mad and don't blame him. I don't. I really don't. More than anything I'm glad we're okay. Things are just going to be so hard. ",06Feb2019,1

I pay my tuition in separate payments each month and it takes my whole paycheck pretty much so I have to be careful with gas and making sure I don’t get in an accident or lose hours at work. Currently I work at a fast food store and my manager suddenly started cutting my hours and making me work late nights every now and then when I can work. When I first got hired I told her that I was beginning college but I wouldn’t take more than two or three classes so I would be free after 3-4 hours of school (which leaves a lot of spare time). And we agreed that I would get at least 30-35 hours a week. But about two months ago maybe three I started getting 18-25 hours a week and barely being able to afford college.

I’ve had so many breakdowns of stress just from not having hours or struggling in school because I feel so alone. I live with my dad and he’s never really attended college so I can’t turn to him. I tried counselors there but they are so busy it takes forever to see them. And my dad keeps insisting I cannot qualify for FASFA but I’m not sure what the requirements are even and I’m not sure if he really knows. 

But I feel so alone and lost and just idiotic at college. I feel like I have no one to turn to for help, anyone to talk to, or I just feel like I don’t belong.

After she passed 4 years ago I was on the verge of a complete breakdown. It happened a year later. Sat in my car and cried till I was dehydrated. I pretty much haven't worked since. Existing everyday and ""sticking around"" to not hurt loved ones has been a battle in itself that isn't helping.

Low B12, high cholesterol, very very high triglyceride. The docotor sent the blood to retest 3 times because he said it was so high that he was sure they messed up, over 2000.

I want to study English and be a teacher one day because I believe young people deserve people who care about teaching not failures in their respective fields. Problem is, my ex-school let's call it DoucheNugget Academy, has provided no support. My email and OneDrive through them was deleted so I lost a large chunk of my notes. I was struggling when I was in this school during Year 13. My biological mother had abandoned me to go to America and I realized I had been here illegally for 12 years. I was scared and my mum's ex who I shall refer to as 'mum' going forward is of no legal relation to me. I needed my status stabilised ASAP so I had to put school on the back burner. DoucheNugget Academy knew this and knew I was legally unable to go to university on time with my peers. I didn't fail my A-Levels completely but I can't afford tutoring or access any teacher who can tell me what mistakes I'm making or what I did wrong last year. I was charged £220 to resit my exams and I feel like it's wasted money and nothing I can do will improve my grades no matter how much I work. Now the stress is tenfold because I don't want to waste my money and the money of my boyfriend's mum who paid for one of my resits.

On top of this, my status was stabilised in September last year. So I was able to get everything necessary and apply for university. DoucheNugget Academy wanted to charge me £100 for a service that was free last year and is free at all other schools in the county and most schools in the country I'd say. I couldn't afford their help so I applied as an individual candidate with a reference from my manager at the time even though I was a temporary employee. Everything looked good. I've received one unconditional offer so far and am in the midst of determining my fee status with two of my five choices. (It's a complicated scenario to be fair) Then, out of the blue my FIRST CHOICE contacted me and said they needed an academic reference. Which is fair, they're a good university. So I contacted DoucheNugget Academy who STILL demand £100 for a reference. I don't need their support with choosing, my personal statement, writing my UCAS form or anything. I did all completely alone. I got an offer with this work I put in all on my lonesome without their help. But one uni, the one I want with all my heart and soul and they want to charge me £100 to write a reference that takes 10 minutes tops. Our financial situation is crap and they know this because I was on a low income bursary last year. Our situation got worse paying for everything necessary to get my status here legal and they are refusing to even set up a payment plan with us. Applying to university through UCAS only cost £24 so why do they think it's fair to charge £100 for just a stupid reference for only one of my five choices. 

I'm so pissed because I've worked so hard for so long to try and achieve this goal. I just want to be a teacher. I want so little and have done so much alone. I wouldn't have gotten this far without my mum, my boyfriend and his mum investing time and even money into me to help me achieve success and to be blocked by DoucheNugget Academy inches from the finish line feels like a slap in the face. I just needed to rant. Sorry if it's not grammatically great and if you're not from the UK and are just totally confused but yelling into the void that is the internet sometimes feels damn near therapeutic.

87,"I originally posted this in r/confessions an hour ago, it was removed and suggested to post here:

Let me start this story off by saying I'm 48, in super good shape. I work out and do the treadmill six days a week, play softball, box, and am super active because I don't want to be 60 some day and have to use a handicap spot at the store. People often think I'm way younger than I am.

A girl I went out with for a couple years 25 years ago broke up with me (I was 23 at the time). She was pretty hot and could get any guy she wanted pretty much. She started seeing another guy behind my back and then tried to make it seem like everything was my fault. She was insulting and mean. She cheated but tried to make it like it was all my fault. She made me feel really awful and I was messed up for a while over it - she said really really mean things. She moved to Georgia with this guy for a year, broke up and came back, started seeing some other guy and then I lost track of her. I was mad and hoped for the worst for her but as time went by, I rarely thought about her and when I did, it wasn't in a good or bad way, just a ""I really don't care what she's doing"" type of way. I've never been on facebook or anything so I never look up people from years ago and just really don't care about stuff like that.

A couple months ago I'm at a Safeway. This isn't even the same city we were both living in 25 years earlier, far away. I'm going down the aisle and there she is. She's overweight and hasn't aged well. She has not taken care of herself at all. We're the same age and she looks at least ten years older than me. I almost didn't recognize her at first.

She looks up and sees me, smiles and says my name. I think she thought I was going to be happy to see her or something, I don't know. Like I was going to hug her and talk and be good old buddies. That was the impression I got from her by the look on her face and the way she said my name.

I just looked at her and went ""man, you really haven't aged well at all.""

The smile disappeared quickly, she put the item she was holding in her cart, left the cart and walked away (leaving the cart where it was, blocking the aisle of course). She left the store and I got worried she might do something crazy. I got close enough to the store exit that I could see her walk to a car, get in and drive away. And that was that.

For the moment it felt great, just to insult her and make her feel bad, even after all these years. The 23 year old me was high fiving myself but the current me, who is much more mature, after a while kind of felt bad. I don't wish bad things on her at this time at all, I don't wish anything for her and I probably could have been nicer. Not to be friends but I guess I didn't have to really insult her, I'm sure that messed her up.",06Feb2019,1
89,"Last year, she started a haircut salon which she runs out of her home. Her establishment process consisted of making a Facebook &amp; Google Maps page and printing off some business cards. That's it.

For what it's worth, she does run it professionally and keeps track of all her transactions and expenses, but she did literally nothing to legally establish the business. She didn't talk to any lawyers, she didn't apply for any licenses, she didn't file any tax paperwork, nothing. 

A lot of people warned her about this, that she needs to register the business somehow or talk to someone about how to file her taxes and stuff like that. 

Her response was basically, ""All I have to do is report my income and expenses once a year. I'll just claim my water/power/gas bills and my equipment and I won't even owe anything.""

Well it's tax season and based on the phone call I heard this morning, she's finding out real quick that's not how it works. I feel kind of bad for her, but at the same time I'm just thinking, ""I told you so."" Thankfully it's none of my business so I'm just gonna stay out of it and let her deal with the consequences.",06Feb2019,1
90,"I’m sorry this is super long. I know there isn’t anything unique in what I’m feeling, but I just felt the need to write it out. I know a lot of my problems stem from me being an anxious introvert that has spent the last several years isolating myself. I moved out of my home state a year ago with my fiance and my brother. Aside from them I really only have my sister and one close friend, and I’ve neglected even those relationships. I have no friends physically in this state. I consider my brother a very close friend, but he just got accepted into the military and will be leaving for basic in a couple months. 

My fiance just started a new job this week and his shifts are opposite mine, so I will only see him on the weekends. We’ve had opposite shifts before, but this will be the first time (except for 1 year out of 6) we won’t have roomates. This week I came home and suddenly I have all this “me time” but there is nothing I want to do to fill it with. I realized how lonely it will be for me when my brother leaves when he was gone for a night and I was home alone. I have my pets, but I feel isolated. It's frustrating because as much as I would like to make new friends, I simultaneously don’t want to put the effort into it and so I don’t bother. I work in a very small office and share zero interests or have anything much in common with the few older coworkers I have.

I feel disconnected and emotionally distant from my parents. They have their own issues they’re working through; as I’ve gotten older they’ve unloaded their stresses on me more than before, which is fine. What’s not fine is how I’ve started seeing my mother; I had so much love and respect for her as a kid. But I’ve seen her choices and mentality. I’ve seen her behavior towards my dad (actually step, but he’s my dad ya know). I’ve seen her entitled attitude and hypocrisy. I’ve seen her repeatedly choose her religion over her family. It’s not ok, and I do resent her, but of course I love her too. 

I’ve always been the “smart kid” and I feel like they take it for granted I’m doing ok. and now it feels like I need to put on a strong front for them that I’m fine. I’m smart after all. Driven and going places. Right. When they call or text me, it feels like they only care about what my brother has been up to. He’s the baby after all. I share very little personal stuff with them, and they don’t dig for it, so it feels like they don’t care about me so much. 

My parents promised us our whole lives they would pay for us to at least attend community college. They did that for my older sister, but when I started college prices increased. Despite being the “straight A kid” they were always so proud to brag about, my mom told me to drop out. I didn’t. Around this time I also had to move out of my parents house because my mom didn’t like me “living in sin” staying the night at my boyfriends house (fiance now) at the age of 21. Their house, their rules, I get it. I wasn’t a difficult kid, I don’t enjoy drinking, I had a job and bought my own food. I was grateful they supported me that long.

I started working full time to pay my way while getting experience in a career I thought I wanted to pursue (Veterinary). Realized I didn’t want that after all, didn’t know what I wanted really so I stopped going to college because I couldn’t afford to take classes without a direction and I couldn’t figure out what I wanted to do. 5 years later and I still haven’t gone back to school due to lack of direction and needing to afford to live. I didn’t qualify for financial aid until this year because my parents made too much money then, and I wasn’t 26/27 yet. I refused to fall for the system of “get student loans to pay for our ever increasing tuition that we can keep increasing because you can just get student loans!” What a world we live in when even community college is a struggle to afford, forget about anything beyond that. 

I’ve decided I want to do something with writing. My goal is to be a self-published author, starting with romances and eventually branching off to other genres. I’ve researched the sub-reddits and know the market well (been reading romances since I was 12 lol). I know I can do it… at least to the extent of replacing my job and being able to do it full time. I love reading and writing, I’ve been told I’m good at it. But when it comes time to actually start… I don’t. 

I feel like writing is the only thing I have left to “make it” and do something other than be a wage slave. I’m terrified to fail, which makes it difficult to just even start on it at all. I want to be an entrepreneur, build something for my fiance and I that we can moderately enjoy doing that allows us to live comfortable lives. I don’t need to be rich, I just want to make something of our own that we can live on. If we can make the same, or just a smidge more, as we do at our jobs now I’d be content. I feel like we’re always broke, but we get by. 

I’m currently in a dead end job that’s super low stress. I needed something like this after years of emotional abuse as a veterinary technician. The idea was at the end of the day I’d go home and write, or write at work, or something. Instead I’m a waste of space filling my time doing jack. I used to be so driven, now I’m just over it all. My best friend says I should consider seeing a therapist to at least have someone to talk all this out with, but I don’t have insurance. Even if I had the money I’d need to prioritize going to a general doctor / dentist / GYN first. 

I don’t enjoy my free time because I feel I should be doing something productive with it. I wanted to learn to draw, play an instrument, continue my education even if just for the sake of keeping my mind from atrophying. It feels that any activity that isn’t promoting our self-employment goals is a waste of time. But then I waste my time anyway, with activities even less productive. Reddit. TV. Anything mindless. Even on reddit I rarely actually participate and post something, it’s just endless lurking. I’m stuck in this loop and I hate myself for it. 

I have considerable free time and computer access at work I could utilize- but the same thing, I can’t pick a focus and do it. I can’t exactly do research for my books and niches and read romances on the job. I’d love to learn a skill or work on something to create a passive income, but I have no clue what direction. I can’t use scripts for mturk on my work computer. I still have my real job and have to plan for interruptions. I’m just so lost, I feel like I’m drifting in a world that feels designed to put and keep me down. I know I’m not unique in this; I just don’t know what to do with myself anymore. 

Anything anyone recommends I do? Anybody going through anything similar, or have in the past? I know I word vomited my story and problems, but I’m a great listener and would love to just chat with some real people going through their own real stuff. ",06Feb2019,1

1.

And I would probably suffocate due to lack of oxygen and not wearing and astronaut suit.
2. I was transported to the right time and the right place, but I didn't notice because I just went back to my body and mind's current state.
3. I was transported to an alien planet and failed to survive due to lack of oxygen again or a hit to the head using an alien weaponry. I could've also survived there, but chose not to leave, because... who would?
4. I was transported to Earth, but of different coordinates, because again, I failed to record my current coordinate. I may be transported to a lethal terrain, so waiting for me to arrive here would be optional.
5. The machine or gadget failed to transport me to this time, but I disappeared already. Which means gone for good.

It really isn't all that early, as my wife and I both had our education out of the way, and I was just trying to settle into the career mode of life.  We added another little girl 9 years later, so that's the whole backstory.

Now, I'm at an age where I want to try new things, and to progress myself to things that I want to have.  Take steps toward a new life.  But, as I'm sitting here, I'm trying to accept the fact that life is what it is, meaning that I'm a married father of 2 girls, I'm 43, average in every single way imaginable.  Average income, average body weight, average height, average car, average home, and average income.  And everything runs pretty smoothly, or as long as a car that has 177K miles on it will take me :D.  
I go to the gym, like I pretty much always have, 3 days per week, enjoy staying fit, though my wife has never had interest in that.  But she does have interest in me.  That's more than probably a lot of guys walking in my shoes can say.  Still, I find myself tempted a lot by the opposite sex.  I would like to think that I could get dates if I suddenly, unluckily, were to find myself single.  But, that's the end of it.  I don't cheat, I don't pursue other females, and I work within the bounds of my career, and, in fact, my life.  I go by the ""rules"".

I'd like to think i can do ""better"" by worldly standards.  More attractive mate, a nicer car, 10 pounds less on my body, make a tad more money, live in a cooler city.  

But, I'm also sitting back and, in my mind, realizing that all of those things I see as ""better"", come with a lot of cost, and some pain, not just to me, but to all those in my life too.  Not worth it.  And there I am.  Accepting that this is the life that I have, and trying to *improve* it, will just F it all up for everyone else, and me too, in the end.

106," This was many years ago, it was one of those very first times you take a shower by yourself without your mother/father. Like a complete idiot (don't ask me why) I poured kids mango shampoo on my head, and ended up snorting like probably two tablespoons of shampoo straight in to my sinuses and my throat. It felt awful, it was like acid and it was burning my eyes and mouth as you can expect, its shampoo. Well, the stinging subsided probably after about 10 seconds, and I carried on showering normally, dried myself, and prepared to go to bed (it was around 8 PM).

So, you know how as a kid your parents told you soap and shampoo is poison (I assume to stop you from drinking it like Kool-Aid), yeah, I thought that i had consumed a lethal dose of mango shampoo and had pretty much mentally prepared myself to die that night in my sleep. It kinda upset me, but not nearly as much as it should have in hindsight. Now that I think about it, I really should have told my parents so that they could take me to hospital or at least arrange a funeral, but instead I did something far more effective.

I tiptoed downstairs, opened the medicine cabinet and reached for the gummy vitamins. It was my last ditch for survival. The healing power of the multivitamins might counteract the fast-acting cyanide in the shampoo and allow me to survive the night. I ate probably two dozen Flintstone gummy vitamins that night, and I went back to bed, trembling at the thought that I wouldn't wake up in the morning, and how stupid my friends and family would think I am for dying of shampoo poisoning of all things.

Long story short, I woke up in the morning, and I was alive. I assumed that the lifetime supply of gummy vitamins basically gave me an extra life, and subsequently forgot about the entire situation and spoke of it to no-one, until I was daydreaming just now and remembered it. Boy was I a stupid four-year-old.

107,"I don't normally use my cellphone for everyday activities. So, I don't always keep up with all the messages and notifications that come my way. This includes phone calls, emails, text messages, and voicemail. If and when I ever get these notifications, I read them quick and discard them. As any person would. That's just business as usual, as far as I'm concerned. But at the end of last month, I received a voice message from a woman I didn't recognize. I listened to it, and it nearly broke my heart.

""Hi honey, it's grandma! I need you to call me when you get home from work, okay? I love you, bye bye!""

At first I was just going to discard the message, but then I paused a moment and thought about it. I could have been overthinking my reaction to the message, and I could be overthinking it right now. But there was one thing that was clear. This was someone's grandmother trying to get ahold of their grandchild. Except, they are unaware the kid changed their number. She sounded like a sweet woman, telling them that she loved them and all, so it would be hard for me to imagine that she was a bad person in any way. Especially after the ""love you"" part of it. I also couldn't entertain the thought of this being an estranged relationship between grandmother and child. It seems she was an active member of the kid's life, her message was cute enough to indicate that.

So I'm sitting here thinking, why the hell would you not tell your own grandmother that you changed your phone number?

I felt so bad that I reached out to the woman, texting her to let her know. I told her the person she's looking for changed their number, but that I don't know what that number is. I didn't want to be the one to say that, and I don't even know if it was a good idea. But I just can't see why someone would leave their grandmother in the dark like that. It made me think that she was going to keep calling and wonder why her grandkid wasn't picking up anymore. She could have tried again and again with no response. Being the sensitive person I am, that would be a heartbreaking scenario to imagine. I sent her a message through the landline, which was an extra fee on my part, but it was worth it.

I don't know who she's trying to talk to, or where to find them, I just wanted to give her closure. I felt she deserved that much.",06Feb2019,1
108,"I was looking for a good subreddit for embarrassing stories but I couldn't fine one... 

So, at a party, I decided to take a shot of vodka. No big deal I thought, because I'd sipped the stuff before, so a shot should be fine. 
I'll just mention that I was entirely sober at this point. My friends are watching, I'm ready to go. Except, and I actually have no idea how I did this, when I go to take the shot, I miss my mouth and pour the whole thing over my face. The alcohol gets in my eyes and they start stinging and watering profusely as my friends are asking me what the fuck that was. The crying makes my eyeliner run, I have to walk like this all the way to the bathroom to get toilet paper and try and dry off my face. It was an all-around awful experience, my makeup was messed up for the rest of the night, and my friends will not be forgetting anytime soon. 

TL; DR: I'm an idiot and I poured my first shot on my face and in my eyes instead of my mouth. ",06Feb2019,1
110,"So here’s a dilemma.

My husband is an awesome person. He has many aspirations and dreams. He keeps on trying to start his business, but gets overwhelmed with school and with what he wants to do easily. He gets over whelmed to the point where he just does nothing. He self-sabotages and doubts and has low self esteem due to years of being raised in a school system that pretty much told him he was a useless idiot who wouldn’t go anywhere because of his race. Amongst other reasons. I know he’s been through a lot and I love him more than anything, and I want him to be able to get where he wants to be, and I think it mostly stems from lack of self confidence. But me telling him he’s awesome and smart isn’t enough. 

My husband has many self confidence slumps like this. We’re not sure what causes it, and therapy doesn’t help him. He doesn’t really have any friends to help and his family doesn’t know how to handle these situations. (They’re big on “machismo”).

I feel like I’ve tried everything that I can to help build him up, but it’s really something that he needs to fix himself for him to get where he wants to he. 

Does anyone have suggestions; I.e books, shows, movies, podcasts, advice, ANYTHING that’s helped you get out of a self esteem slump? ",06Feb2019,1
111,"So background:  
I'm a psych major and doing an assignment on diversity. The assignment asks me to interview some people on their thoughts regarding the subject (questions it lists are below). I kinda live in the middle of nowhere so interviewing people for an assignment would take me an hour to simply get to a place where people would be, and randomly asking strangers questions (and getting them to allow me to use their responses) is kind of awkward imo. If y'all would be willing to help me, I would appreciate it.

Questions:

* When  you hear the word diversity mentioned in the workplace, in the  media,  or in casual conversation, what meaning do you assign this term?
* Does  a particular race, ethnic group, or other minority group come  to mind  when you think of diversity? Does one of these groups pertain to  you?
* Do you think the majority of people in our culture:  

   * Respect cultural differences among groups of people.
   * Show indifference to cultural differences.
   * Lack respect for cultural differences. Explain each choice.
* If you were to make a suggestion about how our culture should handle diversity over the next decade, what would it be?

Also Do You Consent To Me Potentially Using Your Responses In My Assignment?

112,"I’m at a stage in life where I’m having bit of an identity crisis. I work in a creative/ marketing field and have become pretty good at presenting myself professionally. I ‘know myself’ at work, I’m confident in what I have to offer and can make things happen. 

I feel like my corporate identity has taken over my personal identity however. I don’t know who I am outside of work. I don’t know my strengths and weaknesses. I can’t identify passions or hobbies really. I’m overly focussed on achieving at work and don’t know what I really want out of life.

After a few dates with someone I start to feel insecure about what I can really offer. I can be charming and funny on a superficial level (learned largely through my career). I’m loving. But I find it hard to tell someone about myself. I draw complete blanks and feel extremely dull. I’ve worked a lot on my social skills and I’m at a good place, but if I have a better understanding of what (or specifically, who) I’m talking about, I know it will have more impact.

I’m wondering if there are any online tools or proven methods to help me map out my identity on paper. 

I want to know the answers to abstract questions about myself. Who am I? Where do I come from? Who do I want to be? What do I want to do?

I respond well to structure and find it hard to go about it from scratch. Has anyone used any tools like this? How does everyone else self-identify, am I completely overthinking this? It sounds corny, but I need to understand my brand in order to move forward.

I should say I’m on the spectrum, though in the most part highly functioning. Once I know something, I know it, but sometimes understanding these things takes time for me. I want to put the work in so I can feel more confident and complete, and grow as an individual. Thanks for reading.",06Feb2019,1
114,"I'm a sophomore in university and I know that at my age a lot of things will happen. Lately, I've been dealing with a lot of stuff internally and I feel as if I'm on the verge of imploding.

A lot of it comes with my relationships with my  friends. I've been debating with myself on whether I've been a good person to them because I want to become a better person than I was in the past and whenever I think about it, I find that I can contradict myself as well as doubt myself and then I beat myself up for not trying hard enough. It mainly stems, I guess, from one of my best friends sort of distancing themselves from me recently...this has happened in the past in situations between them and their ex in which I had remained neutral since they are both my friends and are very important to me and in turn backfired on me and left me so mentally distressed and doubting on whether I really was wrong for not choosing a side. From then on I've been constantly questioning myself on whether I was being a good friend to everyone I know.

All of this and the stress of the spring semester makes me want to break down and cry a lot. There was a time where I was afraid of being alone, but now, I want to be alone more than ever.

I hope this made any sense, I tried to refrain from rambling. ",06Feb2019,1
115,"I fucked up again. I fuck up every good thing that comes into my life. It's like I have a subconscious aversion to happiness.

My mind is just blank, I can't think of anything but how much of a fucking failure I am. Can't think of anything to say, just end up saying the wrong things. Can't think of what to do. Can't think about the future, only how to mindlessly kill each day.

I thought I was getting better, thought that maybe I was ready to move on with something new. But I see now that I'm not. I see that I'm still shadowed and scarred. 

I want to scream, I want to tear myself apart, burn whatever soul I have and just be content living an empty life. But I can't, because I have such a strong will, such a strong drive, and even it I cannot express it right now, such a strong character. I'm not willing to just give up and lose myself completely.

This cannot continue, I'm taking control of my life, taking control of myself and opening my eyes to the world outside of my little bubble. I've said this far too many times and made no change, but I really can't do this anymore. I've wasted my chances, I feel that this is my last one. 

I'm going to help myself, going to make an appointment with a doctor, get therapy. I'm going to get more sleep. I'm going to make sure I drink enough water. I'm going to eat better. The only pain I'm going to feel from now on is when I push my body to it's limits during exercise. 

I'm ultimately going to find a place and peace within myself, find a way to accept my flaws and learn to live with them. 

I'm taking control; this will be my mantra. When I doubt myself, when I find myself stuck in self-pity, when I lie to myself and make excuses, when I take shortcuts and give in, I'll repeat my mantra.

I'm taking control.",06Feb2019,1
117,"I moved to London three months ago, and since then I have been struggling to find new friends and make acquaintances. My partner, who has been staying in London for the last five years, is more or less the only person I get to interact with on a regular basis, apart from co-workers.
Having been from India where I had a bunch of close friends who were literally like family, it's been tough to suddenly find myself alone.

120,"I haven't and I'm about to experience it any day now. I don't know what to think or how to react. 

My grandma is 74 years old, has Parkinson's and has been living in an assisted living facility for the elderly for about a year now. Although the current one she's only been at for a few months. 

My grandma is on Palliative care right now. She's been declining for a number of days at a rapid pace. It started last Thursday when I  was told she had been unresponsive for a few days and hadn't been eating, then it got better because she was able to have a bath and eat oatmeal a day or so later, then now she's progressing worse as each day goes by. 

I and my family (parents, siblings) have tried to go and visit her as much as possible, I feel like I'm not processing what's happening properly. People are crying around me and upset and I'm just trying to not think about it until it happens.

I don't know what to do right now, I don't know what to think, and I just want to get it over with but at the same time I want to be with her as much as possible before she goes. 

I love my grandma, I have fond memories of growing up with her in my life. From an early age she babysat me, as I grew older I'd visit her each weekend to visit her. I had lots of times of enjoyment with her, lots of times of arguing but ultimately i've always loved my grandma, she always loved me and always said so, I didn't so much express that enough over the years (but in recent days I have made sure to express that). Even with her current state where she is not able to function, not able to stay awake for more than a few seconds at a time, not able to talk, not able to move or eat, and is bed ridden in a nursing home, she nodded her head at me to affirm that she knows we all love her) 

As I said, I've never gone through this before with somebody so close to me. I don't know how I'll respond after it happens. 

I know she'll be watching over me,  and I hope to see her again some day.

121,"I just started a nursing program in the US over the last week, and over the weekend I had to put down a cat that had been very close to me. Monday I nearly got into an accident due to a deaf old lady making a right turn on red as I qas entering the intersection at 40mph on rainslick conditions. Literally missed hitting her two-lane wide turn by the nonexistant skin on my teeth. No reaction from her as I took my bearings as I was sat stalled out, horizontal in the road, two lanes over from where I was originally. 

Today in class, I started feeling super dizzy, disoriented, had a high blood pressure, felt weak all over out of nowhere, and ended up getting wheelchaired out of class to see the on-site doctor. After some talking between, I was told that I was pretty much so stressed that my body broke down before my mental health did. 

I normally don't cry, and admittedly I shed quite a few tears over the weekend from my cat passing, but right now I am laying in a fetal position on my bed going in and out of absolutely profuse crying and a state of complete bewilderment at my situation.

TL:DR; Got wheelchaired out of a college level course for stress, now in a fetal position",06Feb2019,1

123,"I didn’t know where to post this and I don’t really know if this will even make sense or how well I will word this. Okay so I’ve been having this problem recently. I really don’t know what I look like and it’s sending me into this existential meltdown. I’ve always hated getting my picture taken because what I see when I look at myself in the picture is not at all how I see myself. And then I think about when I look in the mirror, it’s not how others see me because what I’m looking at is a mirror image. So I’ll be looking in the mirror thinking that I look good but then as soon as I see a picture of me taken that same day it’s not at all like what I saw in the mirror. I also definitely think I have body dysmorphia because when I was really overweight I always felt and saw myself as thinner than I really was. I’ve recently lost weight but I’m still overweight but I still feel like I look thinner than I really am. So now whenever I walk around I’m thinking about how I have no idea what I really look like to other people and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. I have no way to see what I really look like besides in a mirror or picture and those 2 things show me 2 completely different version of myself. I’m so confused. I’ve always had issues with self image and it just keeps getting worse. I just want to know what I really look like. Does this even make sense? I don’t know. ",06Feb2019,1
