2,"When my best friend stopped talking to me, I was confused and tried to talk it out and contact him with no success and it got quiet, afterwards. Maybe, it was something I did that was not right for him. Maybe, he just feels that it’s not that easy to talk to me anymore. 

Today, he said that he didn’t hate me at all. But, since I used his videos, he wants me to stop. I already know the real truth behind our ‘friendship’.  He wanted us to be friends, just to complain about every minor thing 6 years later. I mean, I really wanted to reconnect with my old friends, but they're too busy playing Fortnite. I probably hate myself for becoming a bad person. It's not fair that they get a bunch of friends, while I get invited to hang out with a 8th grader who lives in a different town at his grandmother's house, which is behind my house.

2. Why does the Golden Gate Bridge attract so many (including us) to suicide?

3. Why is life hard for a mentally unstable person?

4. People always call us/me by our ""real name"". How do we/I make them understand that we/I are multiple entities within one organism without looking crazy?

5. Do I sound like I'm faking it?

6. Have you ever felt that people don't take you as serious as they should but then get mad at you for behaving the same when you don't have the resources to change?

7. After her post, can I give you a hug?

8. What's the meaning of your life?

9. The original child (the one who has a childhood and been having a consistent personality) says she wants to be in control. We can't let her come out because the world is too dangerous for her emotional and psychological health. Anything we're doing wrong?

10. Why is humanity so fucked?

11. I feel like giving up but I didn't have the right methods. How is it so difficult to conflate unsuccessful attempts with adamancy?

12. What makes a parent love their child?

13. Do you think our father will love us again, even if we're unstable and had conflicting beliefs?

14. Is it not right to isolate yourself from a world that's toxic for your own benefit?
15. Is it not important to sustain yourself with the only thing keeping you going (our imagination and 24/7 paracosm) so that you won't be vulnerable and suffer?

16. DID is a terrible disorder, do you have it?

17. The original child obviously has it, she's not coming out because we can't figure anything out and frustration kills her. What are some methods she can do but aren't related to coping?

18. Do you suffer from a mental disorder?

19. Is there any way I can help?

20. This body isn't ours and the environment will drive us mad. There's this stupid little voice that says to stay in school and don't run off. The only reason we stay is because we don't want to put up a false impression of the OC, having them believe she's making this up and running away. Is having an anxiety attack in a secluded area at least alright?

21. What day is it today?

22. What's today's month?

23. An alter not too long ago, has ""recorded"" herfself. Is that too far?

24. What do you think of Amanda Todd? 

25. I wanna be just like you when we grow up!

12,"Been going at it for 2mths. Knew my precious exes irl and things happened organically. Just came out of a 6 yrs r/s, and the previous one before that lasted 5 yrs. Basically single for the first time in a decade. 😂 I am 31F.

I am trying to not get emotionally invested in every potential date. It is also difficult to get used to the fact that most people are ""shopping"" fellow people, like some commodity. 

How are you able to really know someone if you just park them aside after one date? Are you that perfect person yourself?

I wish everyone could give each other more chances. How are you able to find a partner if you are fleeting from one person to the next at different days of the week? How has dating come down to this?

My dates always tell me shit like ""oh you are so pretty and fun, I'm surprised you are single."" Uh-huh and then? They don't ask me out for a second date. I mean, I'm fine with that, and I know it's them not me, but how to develop any attraction or understanding based on knowing someone for less than a day? And wtf is up with ghosting.

I am trying not to be superficial and giving guys many chances but they don't seem to take it. Yes I guess I could just stay off these dating app things but I want to find a partner. 

I am also trying out meetup groups irl but the crowd is usually much older and I can't seem to find topics to chat with said older ppl. ):

13,"Reached out to to a friend from high school a couple of months ago, we went to a museum. She drove up to visit me at school while she was on break. I'm a 20 year old guy she had just had her 19th birthday. I thought it went great we had some good conversations because I hadn't seen her in a while and she's just great and interesting in general. 

She said she would be interested in hanging out when school ends. Yay! I stupidly asked to visit her at her school later on over text, but to my surprise she said yes! But, she cancelled once for a test. Okay I get it, school's important I really understand. I ask if we can reschedule and she says yes! Next time though it's rainy and she cancels. I understand again. 

Problem is that day I called her twice and she didn't pick up. Did this right after she had cancelled. I think she blocked my number after this.

Now it's the 2nd to last week of school. I'm delivering food for testing classrooms. I bend over to take a box off the cart, and think to myself, ""Wouldn't it be awesome if she used the restroom right now."" Then the classroom down the hall opens and closes, and I look up. It's her. I stand up and continue pushing the cart. When we pass each other we make eye contact very anticlimactically, but IT HAPPENED. I was so happy for the rest of the day.

For this same reason, tailgating is the norm. If you don't tailgate, you **will** get cut off because the people turning do not care how much space there is between you, even if they can't fit. They will just jerk the wheel and expect you to suddenly hit the brakes.

 Let's a go(imma use our nicknames if we have them but NO last names will be used):
So our school gives us chromebooks. We have Gmail so my group will message eachother and share writings through Docs. THIS IS A MAJOR POINT. 
In October I slapped Sam(Our Rabid Dog.). Because of some other Drama related issues.(her mom hates my guts FOR NO DAMN REASON).
I sent a WRITTEN apology to her while in ISS (in there for a WHOLE day.) She replys being just a ASSHOLE. Saying that I should *activate Karen voice* Leave her alone amd whatnot. You know. her ass comes right back to me every time
She has been SO DAMN TOXIC on these docs AND COMMENTS. To all of us. ONE BEING A DEATH THREAT. Sent ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL 39 OF THESE DOCS AND COMMENTS. Nothing happened.
My Mom Had Her Removed From The lunch table. HER HAPPY ASS COMES STRAIGHT BACK TO US EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE TOLD HER TO LEAVE.

I hope it all turns out alright and I hope I really enjoy this crazy adventure because this is the first time in my LIFE I've ever just said ""fuck it"" and decided to travel on my own, with my own funds, all on my own time.   


AHHHH! You know, I know my life could've gone down a different path at this point. I had it all figured out, was gonna settle down, and I felt comfortable with that. I think I would've been alright with that if it worked out, but I'm so glad I was able to pick myself up and try something new, crazy, and adventurous when my original life plans got turned upside-down. I don't have a return date/flight in mind because boat life gets complicated, but if it all works out and I have enough funds left, I may end up just staying for a while.

24,"Hey all. I moved to a different state with my parents from Michigan nearly a year I graduated high school. I've been to a number of schools growing up, and unfortunately, I've been bullied and teased (even by some of my teachers as well) in the majority of them. I never really developed any kind of social skills whenever I was out in public, and if ever I had the chance to talk about myself, people would often lose interest in my self description, only paving the way for anxiety to settle in when I met/meet new people. For the small number of people who were interested in me back in the day, I often heard, ""why doesn't he talk (to me)?"" and ""why don't you smile?"" The answer would always be different depending on the situation. Unconsciously, I think I brushed those people off in a way that I wouldn't bring up what ails my heart out of fear that they would really be uninterested or weirded out by talking with me. Small talk really isn't my forte.

I've been lucky enough to make two small groups of friends back home in high school, but here in this new state, it's just been increasingly harder to gain new peers. I've put myself out there, I've made myself known and initiated conversation in meetups, events, and jobs. I know a lot of people, but no one ever really follows up with me. I haven't been back to school in a while, so I don't have the college outlet going for me at the moment. Idk if it's my not being very interesting or what. I play video games, like wasting money on food, and I like messing around with instruments, but I couldn't play one to save my life (when you go to a number of schools growing up, it's hard trying to figure out what drives you).

I’m not poor, I have family and friends, I should be happy but I’m not because of anxiety for no reason at all. Besides the anxiety I just have no hobbies no dreams no goals. Also I’ve never been in a relationship because 1. I’m shy and not confident  and 2. I’ve honestly never had a crush. Isn’t that weird? I went through high school basically avoiding girls. Although a relationship would be nice I don’t think it’ll ever happen. Why don’t I give a shit? 

I don’t give a shit about driving or college either. I’m 18 with no license. I got a permit at 15 but eventually just stopped caring and stopped driving now I’m too anxious to continue. I don’t want to drive because I’ll have to buy a car just to go to a job I don’t care about. I have no clue what kind of job I want either and no way in hell am I going to college. Too much money and I won’t do the work. 

Am I too comfortable with my life? I have good relationships with friends and family, I work at my dads restaurant and have $4000 saved up, I bought a gaming PC a couple months ago. Am I spoiled? 

During high school I was super depressed but lately I just feel bored and don’t see a point in anything. I’m not suicidal I just don’t care about life. I’ve been avoiding growing up so much but it’s not because I wanna be a kid forever it’s cuz idk wtf to look forward to.

I've always thought of myself as very aware about life in general, and death. Very often in conversations I used to underline ""we're gonna die anyway"", looking back now, I didn't put any thoughts into those words, I was saying it for the sake of saying it for whatever reasons... 

Come night about two months ago, I chewed on couple of HBWR seeds alone and laid down in my bed, it was also the first time I tried acid. The body load was so intense I was actually thinking I'd die that night, in truth I was not anywhere close to dying, but in my mind I was facing death at that very moment and I started to cry uncontrollably, that is when the thought came, one day my consciousness will be gone forever from this world, everything I've felt, everything I've attained won't matter anymore, it will be just like before I was born until forever. 

Next day when I got up sleepless that was the only thing I thought about, I got anxiety whenever I went out thinking today is the day when I die, every day was full of fear, oh how I wished I never took those damn seeds but a few weeks passed by ane the fear subsided, I began thinking with a clear mind free of fear, gained new appreciation for everything around us, we're all part of this universe and it is beautiful, complex abstractions built with very small simple pieces, that love, hate, fear and interact with each other, and it is truly... fascinating. I can't believe  I really got a shot at life, a chance to be a part of this universe and my parts will remain part of it as long as it exists. I have newly found love for plants, animals, most of humans and life in general. Though I'd like not to die, I'm okay with it whether it is today or 50 years later, I am ready. My anxiety is almost gone. What was a curse became a blessing, and I'm glad I took those seeds. I want to make difference in this world, even if it's on a very small scale, like changing one person's life to better. if I do that I'll truly leave this world happy. 

One of these days I'm going to write a goodbye letter in case something happens to me in the future, I want my family to find it, I want them to know that I was okay with leaving the living.

Maybe everybody is in on this and I was just out of loop, but that doesn't matter, I've found a way to become a better person and that's what matters.

My girlfriend and I were technically accepted but they needed a final answer from the regional manager so I’m definitely hoping it’s a yes. It’s looking very good though! 

I’m paying off two months of rent and my security deposit. Most jobs around here are about $11 an hour. My rent is $570.

Hopefully I can get a job that pays more than $11 haha. I’m doing DoorDash on the side as well. So I’m not really nervous about getting the money.. I’m just nervous that I’m underestimating everything. 

I don’t even know how much my utilities will be. It worries me that it can be an unknown amount every month. Then I’m worried about emergencies or literally anything unexpected. I don’t want to fall behind. I don’t want to live paycheck to paycheck either.

41,"There is a specific circumstance that I can make my heart skip a beat. I will occasionally use poppers when I’m having some alone time. Once the activities are over and I’m laying there with my heart beating so hard I can literally see my skin move with each beat if I concentrate in just the right way (I still don’t know exactly how I do it ) I can make it skip a beat. I have done this a bunch in the past but didn’t think much of it until tonight. I’ll try to make it skip a beat tomorrow when I know the poppers are not affecting me anymore and see if I can do it then.

I have everything i need to live a comfortable life and that is something that so many people in this world don't get to have. I've rarely needed to worry about things besides school and getting to work on time. Although I have had low points, I've been able to bounce right back in no time. I have some of the most amazing friends anyone could ask for and a family that loves each other. And that alone counts for so much more than money and fame. I'm not alone because I have people that care about me all around me. Those same people will always push me back into the right directions whenever I get lost or confused.

57,"My ex (first love)  is the perfect guy. Noble, good heart good son good boyfriend good brother and friend, Good Samaritan , good looking, good student. He has always been and he will always be. Everything I wanted in someone.  We went thru so much shit together. We were together when we were 12/13-15/16 years old I didn’t realize what I had until we broke up. It’s been 6 years and still can’t get over him, I’m still thinking one day he will be back, the fact that we kept talking all this 6 years even tho he’s in a committed relationship and probably marrying eventually didn’t help at all, he just fed a fantasy because he felt sorry for me. He is not interested  in me romantically at all. He told me the last time we talked that he felt since the beggining that I wasn’t his other half, that most of our relationship was an act because he didn’t want to hurt me. That he felt sorry for me and he didn’t want to hurt me anymore, he wanted to leave me but he couldn’t without hurting me. So when I left him he felt sad for the good times but happy that he finally got rid of me, he didn’t want me close at all. He kept talking to me over the years to try to compensate all the wrong he did to me. He was an imbecile and he knows it and it makes him feel terrible every time he remembers me. he knows what it caused in me. He’s head over heels in love with his gf and he’s actually afraid that she’s gonna do to him the same he did to me. “Fake it”.  I forgave everything because we were kids. He set a really high bar that nobody could ever reach. My actual boyfriend is almost there( with who I got because I thought I was over my first) who’s is a very nice guy, his heart is so big, there's no mean bone in his body, he's a good son, not as thoughtful and more cold, he's love language is definitely not like mine but I have learned to read it and accept it. He's a good brother a good student, idk about Samaritan, he doesn't really care for people. Extremely good looking. Amazing boyfriend. He’s not perfect, there’s stuff I wish he did different. But even like that I have a thing for him. Like the adult love thing where you accept them even with all imperfections. I guess the idea that it didn't work out with my ex because we were young, I feel like now it could. If he gave me the chance. But if he did I don't think I would be able to leave my boyfriend. He's amazing with all and his imperfections. And I really want to be with him. He will never be my ex but i choose him.I know he's the right for me.  It got bad when I realize my actual SO wasn’t playing with me and was actually getting serious. I told my self it was not normal to keep checking up on my ex and thinking about what he thought of me. And that is a trigger that has ruined everything. Now I see him everywhere, people look like him, colors, scents. Even my SO reminds me of him (thing that never cross my mind for more than a year ) If the case is that I still love my first. How do I stop? How do I get over him? So I can be with my actual SO? I really don't want to leave my SO.

P.S. my SO knows about ALL this about my feelings and everything and he believes I can overcome this. He’s 100% amazing and supportive.  He’s there for me, he listens. He understands.

60,"the tl;dr is at the bottom since this is kinda long, also english is not my 1st language so if i fuck up some words i have an excuse :)  


So, actually this was happened yeasterday but only today my supervisor spoke with me about it, i work on a call-center for a insurance company who sells health insurance and right now i'm on customers support which is on the same spot where the sales people are, so, i'm a dude 23m and some girls on my team told me that on the bathroom were free tampons for the ladys and i asked for one just for fun because we are immature and a tampon is funny to play with.  


So she went to the WC and got me one which i was playing with, even my supervisor played with it ( great guy we hang out a lot, go out together etc, on work we are cow-workers but outside we are friends ) and then after being bored for sometime i decided to throw it to a girl on the sales side who i found cute ( dat ass ).  


Well, i threw it and she started freeking the fuck out, complained about me to her supervisor who ( another guy i'm friends with ) asked me to apolagize to her as a bro because she was really freeking out about it ( ffs, i don't know her age but she seems like 21 or 22 ).  


Yea so after a bit she went to the WC and passed me and i called her so i could apolagize to her and she said something i didnt understood and turned her back on me and left, i was like ok fuck her who cares, and latter that night a cow-worker of her that i'm friends with texted me saying she said that it was okay etc and i was a little '' mad '' because she could have told me that in person and not by someone.  


Okay so now today my supervisor came to see me and told me she complained to her sup who had to complain about it to the big supervisor and the big supervisor ( who i know too and it's a good guy in general ) came to talk with my supervisor about it and now my supervisor just came to me to speak to me about it and he had to write about it on the company system, now that fucks me a little because everyone is cool to me and vice versa, i'm a good worker and never had a problem and now i have this '' criminal record '' inside the company im with for 2 years without a problem before.  


well, the truth is i find it funnier than im mad about it since i dont really give a fuck about if i work here or not since they pay us really bad and the work is really shitty, im here just because i love my friends here and the money was always enough to the things i wanted but now i'm going to search for another job and after the summer ( since i have my vacations planned already ) i'm going away from this, this was the final push i needed maybe, i don't want to sound '' not thankefull '' but i always gave everything for this company and they, like any company, at the 1st chance always screw us so who cares, i'm leaving on good terms ofc.  


but yea, that's my funny story for today, hope you enjoyed it and it made you laugh like it made me.

61,"Over a month ago I saw a text on my boyfriends phone from his ex. 

A bit of back story: my boyfriend was on and off with his ex for 3 years. They started as FWB, till she got pregnant, he tried to make a relationship work for the sake of their son. Last year, he breaks up with her because he doesn’t love her anymore and the arguments are unhealthy for not only them for their son to be hearing. He moves out and tries to maintain a “civil association” with her so he can continue to see his son. 

Me and him already knew each other, because we work together. He spoke about his relationship with her and how hard it was when they were still together. We were both newly single when we decided to get to know each other more. We kept this a secret obviously, because we didn’t want work colleagues knowing, especially not her. 

His ex is the type of girl (I hate to say it), that is not all there. She thinks she knows the whole world, and believes she deserves it. She’s selfish, argumentative, bitter, nasty. To put it into perspective, my bf’s family all hates her before they split up, in their words “she’s a mouthy liar, who only cares about herself”. Her own mother doesn’t spend time with her, only her grandson and her other children. The only people who like her are her friends. 

So, me and my bf have been together for 8 months. And over a month ago, my bf and his ex were arguing about when he was seeing his son via text. He was reading the messages out to me, and I’ve heard her before on the phone and the things she says are utter vile (eg: wishing death on his family). Only this time, I happened to just look down at his phone when he was reading this massive paragraph. The text said, “you’re alright playing happy families and sleeping with me”. 

Of course I confronted him, he denied it at first. Then he said it was just after they’d split up.  No explanation as to why, but it was before me and him had even slept together and he “only lied because he knew it would make me uninterested in him”. I split up with him few days after because I couldn’t believe that he hadn’t been sleeping with her this whole time. 

We got back together. I was absolutely heartbroken when we split up. His mum told me he’d been up all hour and could hear him crying. I thought the love we have for each other is stronger than any lie that has been told. I just couldn’t bear not being in his life anymore. I told him, what’s happened had happened, we need to move forward and start afresh.  We had two weeks were he was even talking more about the future with me and it was like the honeymoon phase all over again. 

She’s now saying that he’s been playing me along, because he was sleeping with her when we were together. Now I don’t know what to or who to believe. There was occasions were he would go to his friends house to stay over. He doesn’t do that since we got back together, and it makes me wonder if he was staying over at hers. 

I’m unsure if I even want to know the truth, if I’m ready for it. I honestly don’t know wheat the right thing to do is. I’m feeling really shitty because all that’s going through my head is: I’m obviously not enough if he goes back to the person he says he hates. And I’m constantly questioning my worth. Another thing to add is she wants to split us up because she doesn’t want me in his life because I’m “thinner and prettier”. He knows there’s something more up with me and I know I need to speak to him about it, but I think if I do, it’ll split us up again.",15May2019,0

Which makes no sense to me, I had three beer in 12 hours. There is no WAY I was over the limit, but I have no idea how to prove my innocence. I went straight to the hospital for a blood sample, which I will get the results from tomorrow, but the nurses made it very clear that for dui charges the ONLY tests that matter are the ones the police do, or request. So my own may not even count for anything. And as a result, I lose everything.

She said, “oh my! There’s this girl.. her name is ___, you guys would get along.. she does the same exact drugs as you and she has a greats sense of humor”. That month, each day I could not stop possibly thinking of the girl. I thought to myself since she is so much like me.. what if I got in a relationship with her..? A month goes by and she is at our school. We talked for that first month and got to know each other so well and got along. After that first month of getting to know her we had went to a little hangout and made out and turned into a relationship. She helped me through so much, even to quitting my drug addiction. It still makes me feel odd how before I even met her in person, I already pictured something her and I have now!

I want the preferred buttons to appear in front of the other ones also alphabetically with some indicative star or other symbol by them.

68,"I grew up kind of fast after some trauma I experienced two years ago, when I was seventeen. I made some bad choices, and then I almost made one that could have ruined my life. Ever since then, I’ve been consumed by anxiety over doing the right things. The only way I can soothe it is to do the most I can and the best I can. 

I was disappointed when I couldn’t leave home for college. My mother is really over protective. It’s another source of anxiety for me. I feel like I need room to grow, but she stifles me because she worries. That’s why I do the most I can and the best I can. It soothes me taking as many classes as I can and doing my best because I know if I finish school early, I can be independent earlier. I don’t trust her, but that’s not important right now. 

My friends got to leave home. They’re having a great time living the college life. They’re so fulfilled that they can’t answer my calls. They’re not even busier than me. They don’t take as many classes as I do or work like I do. 

I love my job. It’s the most exciting thing about my life right now. I work in an office at school. I was elated to quit retail, and I love the people I work with. Many of them are professors. I love them. I never had a good relationship with my father, and many of them are willing to help fill that role for me. They’re proud of me because I work so hard and I get good grades. 

I don’t really connect with people in class. Mostly because it’s class and I need to focus on studying, but it’s hard for me to make friends. My boss says it’s because I’m way more mature than people my age, but I still miss my friends from high school. I think they kind of replaced me with other people, but it’s hard to replace that kind of friendship for me. I don’t really hang out with people my age anymore because most of my social interaction is at work. I have friends, but they’re mostly faculty I work with. My best friend is 26. She’s seven years older, but I feel like we’re in a similar place in life. 

A few boys have been interested in me. I was an ugly duckling in high school, so I was pleased to have the attention, but they’re not the kind of boys I’d want to date. During my time working here, two professors have asked me out on dates— one of them only a half hour after he submitted my grade for his class. We spent a lot of time together because I took his class without knowing he came to our office, and then I worked a lot while he was in. I really really like him, but I had to say no for now. I think it’s that anxiety thing, but I really wanted to, and I was sad when I had to say goodbye for him for the summer. 

I kind of wonder what it would be like to be like my friends and party, procrastinate on school work, drink, and have a good social life with people my age. What would it be like to meet boys at a party? How come this old professor was willing to drive an hour to see me but my friend that lives a half hour away can’t call me back? What would it be like to let go and not worry? To have the “college experience?”",15May2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

I greatly believe in not prolonging connections with anything that doesn’t reverberate with your world view, so I did what I considered the best approach:

&amp;#x200B;

1 – Let go of my old house and embraced the opportunity to start from scratch, far enough from where I lived;

&amp;#x200B;

2 – Before leaving I had a meeting with other neighbors to explain ‘em what happened so they could take their own conclusions and I could have in my conscience that I was up to date with my civic obligations.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I’ve been on a meditation /inner discovery path which has been quite fulfilling, but there’s something I have to address soon: my above stated experiences made me care much less to usual everyday routines and stuff, up to the point where I have no motivation for important worldly things such as my work (I’m a freelancer so at least I’m not doing harm to a team) and conquering material belongings. However, while living in this reality one cannot completely abandon such subjects.

This past year has been the hardest in my life. Amongst other things, my then best male friend ended our friendship because his new girlfriend demanded he end our friendship as I had feelings for him. This made me question my worth as a friend, because it was so easy for him to throw away our friendship for a fresh relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I was asked by two people to meet up. I opened my calendar. My next two weeks are fully planned out, because I spend a lot more time now with my other friends and I am meeting with a friend every night now. I am not a bad friend, and that experience was not a reflection of me as a friend. It made me smile, it made me feel damn proud. I don't wanna brag about the amount of friends I have. Today it just hit me again, that I have friends that cherish my friendship. I have friends that were there for me for through the hard times. I am happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

While I may not be as productive, or as tidy, or as put together as I was before this past year, I can accept that, without judging myself too hard and realizing today how many great people I am surrounded by just made me realize this once more.

79,"I can't do it, I won't get better, the reason I feel like this and why I won't get better is all my fault. I get really down on myself and it just becomes a downward spiral of negative thoughts. I don't see anything positive about myself, and see no reason why anyone would ever like me. I just don't feel like a person, empty and just missing what makes others happy or at all interesting people.

I don’t know if I ever really felt like I was loved. I feel guilty for feeling that way too because I know my family loves me, I just don't feel it for some reason. I know I need to be doing stuff to change how I feel, but I never do. Anxiety entirely stops me from doing so many things. Never step out of comfort zone. I feel like I just can't do anything ever and just slowly do less and feel worse.

I realized that all my friends are online only, and that any day I could just not hear from them ever again. Whether they suddenly don't like me, something happens to them, or they just stop getting online. I could just never take to them again.

Not liking how I look; hair, the way I dress, just everything, but being entirely undue of what to change, how to change it, and being too afraid of the change itself to actually work towards changing anything. I feel that being alone I think about everything negative without control and just fall apart slowly feeling worse. Relying on friends to put me back together and keep me together, just to fall apart when they are going again. What happens if they aren't around anymore, just one day all gone and never come back? The games I play are just to waste time, but they already end up hurting my wrist and making me feel awful when I inevitably play poorly and disappoint myself. Plus when I get upset a game and give up it ruins the game for everyone else. Why do I play them? Do I really have nothing worthwhile to do in life at all?

Feel like I’m just a waste. Waste of space, of people’s time, effort, care. I can’t do anything for myself to feel better. So I don’t deserve any help from other people. I don’t deserve to ever feel better because I never try anything to make myself feel better

To start this off I'm only 17 I get that I still have my whole life ahead of me, whatevers going through my head isn't the end of the world yadayadayada, but I still just want some help or support..

Basically this last year has been pretty good for me, I was finally able to make some friends that I could spend time with, I finally started being able to just talk to people for once, and I even found someone that I could actually trust and that I could talk to about basically anything. But then most of my other friends started just making me feel guilty for trusting her (let's just call her Jane for convenience), I've never actually been able to talk to anyone before about any actual problems I've had, not even my family, I've always just had to have my own back because I feel like nobody else will. But then recently I found out that most of my other friends had been saying I was just ""up Jane's hole"" (idk if that's just a term we use here but basically it's just like them saying I nearly give her special treatment EVEN THO I JUST DONT, I literally make sure I treat everyone the same as they deserve to be treated and I try to be as nice as I can to anyone) so then obviously I was feeling more than a little upset and I unintentionally did something stupid to make them start to not like me. I've apologised as much as I could and I'm actively trying to change the things I do and how I think just to make it up to them, but I'm not sure if they'll ever actually forgive me cos they're just petty like that. (I'm not even saying that to be mean they've literally said it themselves before) one of them even said the only reason they considered making peace with me was because they felt bad for me, which brings me to my next point.

I just feel like I'm a burden to everyone I've ever met and sometimes I just don't deserve happiness or friends or anything so I just lock myself up in my room and sometimes don't eat all day. I've ended up just coming home into my room crying the last 2 days now, and I normally never cry unless there is something seriously wrong. What I would normally do is text Jane, my best friend, and ask if I could meet her so I could talk and just try to take my mind off things, but recently I've just been feeling like I was more of a burden to her too. She hasn't been texting me as much as she normally does and I know obviously she doesn't have to be texting me all the time like cmon I'm not stupid, but whenever any of my friends have ever been feeling down or depressed or anything, I've always done my best to actually properly be there for them and do all I can to make them feel better, but whenever I start feeling down I just feel like everyone disappears and I just end up being so alone again, and I really hate that feeling.

I started smoking weed 18 by 19 coke hit my nose and before 20 I was selling it tryna to impress my ex then Molly was intorduced to me by my new girl about 21 and it just escalated from there and everythinh was okay until I started smoking dope... I'm not gunna get into to much details of the reasons why I wanted to do anything to numb me. Maybe another day. Anyways so I know how this shit turns people upside down and around . The ups and downs take a toll on your mind and anxiety starts to set in and then before you know it your life you once had is in the past and your looking around at your new life and its full of dirty places, scumbags using you to get high and your annoyingly  knocking on the devils door trying to escape but youre just getting deeper till you hit rock bottom.. So I'm not gonna go any further on this subject either but you get the point.. Soooooo you would think that someone who has been through it wouldnt want there buddy or someone they love to go through this vicious cycle right well I guess common sense isnt so common these days or is it and people are just haters. So back to my litttle brother. He is a solid mfer before 22-23 had a house and now 25 with a boat badass truck dirtbike and a solid trade that he can make 100k+ but right now he makes probably 65k+ not sure but around there and his only problem is his girl is a evil black hole who likes to suck the life out of him but thats not what I'm hear to talk about anyways so I was a pretty great example of what not to-do. I had my shit going also until 10-2 came into my life so I promised myself I'd do anything to make sure he never does.. when i got out of jail I made sure anyone i knew that did dope and was around my brother knew what was coming if they gave it to my brother...nothing good.... So this fucking stupuf mfer thought he could go behind my back right after I just talked to him about it within the last month.. I mean I probably told him that id kill someone if they gave my brother dope cause thats what there doing to his life feel me... I did everything for this friend.. I'd feed him and his girl id shoot him gas or dab or weed or shit I did anything to help this guy out and in return he was going to my brothers giving him dope...................I told him I was gunna slap him like a bitch if i ever found out but I guess he thought I was playinv well my brother asked me (begged) me not to beat our boys ass so what did I do take a guess 



Well........

Lets just say


I fucked his girl so hard she never cummed this hard and I could tell considering I'm pretty good in bed so I know when a girls first time squriting or not and she was loving it orgasm till she passed out about anyways. I know for a Damn fact that he doesnt love his girl more then I love my brother and I wasnt ruining her or his life by fucking the life out of his female but to me it seems he also knows what dope does to you he been doing it for years,longer then me but he still choose to do what he did after looking me in the eye and gave me his word but anyways..

I've never once smoked a cigarette. I always thought that it was stupid.
My girlfriend asked me once if it would be okay if she smoked, that caught me off guard as I was under the impression that she also doesn't smoke.
This kind of fucked me up pretty bad. It's sort of an anxiety even maybe. I see people who smoke and am disgusted. I can't stand smelling it. I hate talking to someone that smoked before. I have nightmares about it ridiculously often. I am always afraid she might smoke.
I know it has to sound irrational to you. But it's a feeling of deep disgust that I've developed after my girlfriend asked me if it would be okay for me if she smoked a cigarette. That's what fears are though, irrational. 
This has been on my mind for literally months. I fucking hate the way my brain works. I can't let go of it.
I am doing everything I can to be perfect for her.
I think I might need professional help.
Or I might just continue posting about every once in a while in different subreddits. Ranting, like I do know. Hoping to get a few days of a peaceful mind out of it. Cigarettes and smoking trigger me.
What the fuck is wrong with me.
On the other hand. Some men aren't into tall women, brown hair or whatever. I would never judge anyone for something they can't change.
Maybe I can't change my hate for cigarettes. Why would you judge me for that? Smoking is bad, everyone knows. So why am I the crazy one. Why do I have to defend myself for finding self-destructive behavior repulsive. Why is it socially accepted to wreck your body, your health, all that matters.
I understand addictions are hard to overcome. But that doesn't mean that you are supposed to cherish it. Take it for what it is. Something that should not be seen as good, decent, cool, or in any way, shape or form positive.

If you smoke, that's a flaw. You should try to change. Am I wrong for wanting the right thing? Do I need a therapist to tell me more flaws are better? I can't control my thoughts. I bury myself in work to put my mind to other things. I don't know how long I can take this",15May2019,1
104,"A little back story: I stopped trying in school in about grade 8, it just wasn't for me and after that I coasted through all the way to graduation. I didn't do homework, I had no interest in paying attention, but I still made it regardless. Over that time I wasn't really a jerk or anything, but by the time senior year rolled around I was fed up with the constant drama and general BS of it all. For my final 2 years I had a gym teacher that was fresh out of Uni. He was slightly older than my brother. He was young, and a complete douche. Worst ego I've seen in a teacher. Essentially I had no respect for him because of how he acted. 

Fast forward to this year, he teaches my younger sister, (who is SIX years younger than me). My sister and I are nothing alike, raised in different generations, not even fully blood related. I was loud and talkative, she is the opposite. Quiet and of few words.

This ""teacher"" or ""mentor"" or ""educator"" or whatever he considers himself to be, blatantly tells a 14 year old that he doesn't like her because quote, ""your brother didn't respect me"". I couldn't believe it. What kind of a teacher speaks like that to a 14 year old?

However, I somehow always manage to fuck up math exams. I always get the hardest problems 100% right, and I grasp all the concepts just fine. But it’s the easiest things that seem to bite me in the ass.  

Back in 10th grade, during my IGCSE Pure Math exam, I got everything on the paper right, but I ended up losing marks because I expanded (x+2)^2 wrong. It ended up costing me my A* for one mark. In 11th grade, during my IAL F2 exam, I somehow added some fractions in a disgustingly wrong manner, which made me end up with a B in that unit. I’ve fucked up other exams before, but these have always stuck with me, simply due to how much effort and practice I put into math + the absurd nature of these errors.  

Today, in my Mechanics 3 exam, I just freaking *forgot* to multiply a fraction, and I’m pretty sure that will end up costing me a good chunk of marks. I just don’t understand how this keeps happening to me. I have practiced every single day for the past two months, and I had it all down 100%, but I keep managing to find new ways to fuck up. My friends are generally very supportive of me when I talk to them about this, but it’s obvious that they can’t relate, which makes it seem more frustrating.  

It’s not even that I don’t test well. I’m very calm and collected during exams, and I don’t make such stupid mistakes in other subjects. It’s always math, and it always ends up costing me a grade. Going into uni this fall, I’m worried now that this blight will follow me there too.

115,"Because I fall for it all the damn time. I’m not saying gaslighting *isn’t* real, it’s so real, it’s just that sometimes you don’t realize that it’s happening. Most of the time I don’t realize that I’m being gaslighted, and once I finally do, it hurts like hell.

Other than the fact that they’re trying to manipulate and cancel my emotions, the thing about gaslighting that hurts for me the most is the fact that I let myself fall for it all the time. Even when I *know* I’m being gaslighted, even though I *know* they’re doing it to save their asses, my instinct is to feel guilty for sounding my emotions and standing my ground. They know this. They fucking know this is what I would do. In the end, even though I’m fully aware that I’m being gaslighted, I can’t do anything other than letting them get the best of me.

Any advice on how to stop being a victim of gaslighting? What do you say when you’ve come to the realization that you’re being gaslighted? How do you not feel guilty for accusing them of gaslighting you?",15May2019,10
116,"I see so much BS advice saying “how can anyone love you if you don’t even love yourself?”, basically saying that people who struggle with their self image aren’t worthy of love. I jumped from relationship to hookup to fling and really never gave my heart the break that everyone told me I need. I had one night stands that only made me feel more empty and hate myself even more, knowing that I can’t handle physical affection outside of a loving relationship but was so desperate for affection that I did it anyway. 

I met my boyfriend over a year ago and he just blew my world. He is the sweetest, more caring and patient man I know. He has been with me every step of the way and patiently dealing with my insecurities. He’s helped me to see that I’m not the piece of shit my mind insisted on labeling me as. He helped me to see that I’m worth more than my body and that yes, even with all my insecurities and anxiety, I deserve love. 

Since I was in a very toxic relationship in the past, I swore I wouldn’t give into the same mistake of making my boyfriend my whole world again. And so my boyfriend and I encourage each other to seek new challenges and to have healthy social lives. I workout, see my friends very often, volunteer, cook, meeting new people, even travel by myself, and live life to the fullest. And now I have someone who loves me, who I love, there to experience life together with.",15May2019,69

118,"Recently, I started self harming (December). In February a girl on my track team saw and was kind and asked me about it politely. We got into a discussion and everything kinda just poured out on her. It didn't scare her away from me, thankfully.

 Over the past couple of months we have gotten incredibly close. I don't think we haven't not face timed or called since February. I've been through a lot and I have a lot of bad nights that i turn to her for. I feel like she takes in all my problems and keeps them in her. She's only cried to me a couple times and most of them are because of me and because I've scared her with what i've said. I know she loves me to the end of the world and i love her to the moon and back, but I feel like I rely on her too much.

 I tried pulling away when I get sad so she has less burden, but either i end up caving and call her or she asks me why im pulling away and that she hates it. There have beeb several times I've told her to ""pull out"" before i do something horrible and she gets hurt for it. Even one of her close friends agree we may be too close.

The friendship is just so one sided even if she says it isn't. She takes care of me and stays up for me and listens. I don't know any of her problems and she rarely gets emotional about other stuff. (Of course i hear about gossipping and like friend problems but nothing serious). She says that me talking to her all the time helps with her real problems but i just feel like I don't do enough. I don't want her to get hurt because shes too close to me. And neither of us has ever had such a close relationship with something so heavy on us every single day. There are a lot of bad days but a lot of good ones too. Im at a lost here.",15May2019,2
119,"Alright, so there are a couple of things that I’d like to clear up before this story that should be kept in mind.

1. I live in Canada. In the winter it can easily drop below -30 degrees Celsius. I also will be using Canadian terminology and spelling etc.
2. The names of people will be shortened as follows: me/I (obviously me), TCP (my main circle of 5-6 friends), VP (Vice Principal), and NE (nemesis).
3. All the blackjack games are 100% legal. We used chips that represent no actual currency.
4. We actually named the timeframes that everything took place, so that is how it will be organized.


THE NE ERA 
-When NE was the dealer in blackjack, last three weeks-

It all started at the beginning of the school year. TCP reunited after summer break for the first time since June. We, as a whole, thought that wit would be a great idea for us to have blackjack games every lunch. NE is now introduced. He wasn’t a member of TCP, but we agreed to let him be our dealer. Perhaps the dumbest decision we ever made. He was a tyrannical dealer. You would lose gross amounts of chips for doing nothing wrong (saying the time would make you lose a quarter of your chips, making a joke without permission resulted in half, I once lost most of my chips for talking, basically having any fun was a crime.) Anyways, after three weeks of this crap we decided to oust him as the dealer. Not taking this well, NE decided to be the most annoying person after our decision. This resulted in a fight between NE and one of my friends. Following that, we were evicted from the room we played in. This event also started what we call “The Blackjack War”.



THE HOBO ERA 
-we didn’t have a place to play blackjack, lasted about a month-

Nothing really happened, we just agreed that NE was permanently banned from playing with us when we started playing again.


THE BLACKJACK WAR
-blackjack came back, but this is when things went from bad to worse with NE. Since the start of The Blackjack War (starting at the end of the NE Era,) it lasted eight months-

One of our friends showed us the place he spends lunch at. Very nice, empty of people, perfect for us to play. The area is right underneath a stairwell and it has two glass doors to go outside (very important for the story.) Our friend let us play there and it was great.

Things with NE hadn’t been fully tarnished and we started somewhat rebuilding relations with him, but he was still banned and we had no intentions of removing this ban (there were several votes on this, all ending unanimously with keeping the ban.) We actually had a good moment or two together, but that all went away one cold (minus 20 degree cold) January day.
 
NE came to our area and decided that is would be a good idea to hold one of the two glass doors open. Basically, he tried to freeze us out. People even passed by and commented how cold it was. The VP came in to try and get him to leave, but there was no success. When asked why the door was kept open, he said “It’s lovely weather” and would refuse to leave. So, for a painful half an hour we held our ground. Now, you might be thinking “Why didn’t you leave?” The answer is that would give NE what he wanted. It would be victorious to him if we were to leave, and we were not going to give it. Finally, lunch ended and we left the area. He only kept us from playing one day because that was the first and last time he did that.
 
We never had positive moment with him after that. He visited a couple of times and we humoured him despite despising his presence. 
 
Flash forward by four months, it’s my birthday (not significant to the story, I just found it interesting that they took place on the same day.) It was sunny and warm, so we decided to play outside. Today was, unbeknownst to me, going to be the day that changed everything with NE. He came over and today we decided that we didn’t want him there. He wouldn’t take no for an answer (as we learned from the door incident,) so we didn’t bother asking him to leave. Instead, I decided to do things he hated to make him leave like doing annoying stuff and talking about topics that his political views don’t agree with (he believes that I am a Nazi for these views when in reality I am mostly left wing.) None of it worked and insults began to be exchanged. So here begins the true conflict.
 
While everyone is outside, I decided to keep the door open so we didn’t get locked out (there are no handles outside of the door.) NE, on the other hand, had different plans. He wanted to lock us out which would cause us to be incredibly upset. So I stayed at the door, using my dead wait to prevent him from closing it. Now he is becoming a real nuance. He is pushing on me to get me off, so I tell him to stop doing that as it is assault and it will result in me using self defence. He doesn’t stop and tells me to just leave. At this point I was highly uncomfortable with how he was treating and harassing me. I am having none of it. I drop to the ground to make things harder for him to get me to move. At that point I was pretty much a human doorstop. He then proceeds to physically grab me in an attempt to move me. 

Then it happened. His tyranny as a dealer, his insults, him trying to freeze us out, and now this. I threw a weak punch at him out of self defence and to let him know to buzz off. He didn’t buzz off, it actually enraged him. Before I knew it, both of our glasses were to the side and we were on our feet while he was throwing the worst punches you can imagine, he didn’t even land half of them, while saying “You deserve every punch I give you!” Me, I’m not much of a fighter, so I’m just deflecting his hits and at one point grabbed his wrist so he could stop. Next thing you know, VP is there trying to stop him from attempting to beat me up. It doesn’t work until we all get inside the building and are momentarily separated.

I then head to the office to report what just happened, but not before I call my mother to tell her what just happened. Then I see NE leave the office and he sees me. Things weren’t done yet. He then tried to attack me again, and I already had my glasses and backpack aside and was ready to defend myself again. The VP then told me to leave immediately. Immediately I am going away from him. Looking behind I notice that he was walking towards me. HE WAS WALKING. I guess that common sense didn’t occur to him and he could run after me. So here I am running around the school while the VP is telling me where it go. By the time I reach the office the school is in a secure school (nobody is allowed to leave class rooms but teaching is still happening.) That chase was the last I ever saw of NE.

In the office, while waiting to give my story to the VP, I am texting a few non-TCP friends about why there is a secure school, just to let them know why they can’t take washroom breaks. Another TCP friend was explaining the whole story to people in his class. Eventually the VP returns and I explain everything. Eventually I was allowed to return to class, but not before being told that NE was suspended for the remainder of the week.

So, with the quick spreading of the news that he attacked me for me stopping him from being an absolute bully, many people turned from neutral to being against him.


POST BLACKJACK WAR
-happy time-

It was told to me that he is now no longer allowed to approach me or the area we hang out in. Seeing this as a victory and an end to the Blackjack War, we were incredibly content. For a period of about two weeks after NE should have returned to school nobody saw him. We then got the great news that he was transferring schools. He wasn’t expelled, but his parents probably made him change after news that he was on a rampage to beat me. This officially now means that he is no longer an issue and the whole of TCP is exited about the news.

In the end, NE lost most of his closest friends, got suspended, earned a few enemies, got his assault on me on his record, and is transferring schools. 

We all look back at this whole conflict with him and laugh.",15May2019,0
120,"How do i stop trying to make people like me? I try to be all funny to others and i aint funny, cringe af....im an invisible boring nice guy.. how did you guys change?? 

I chase everyone even people who dont like me and no one ever puts their effort into me, or be interested in me, it makes me feel like i dont have valueless/pointless/worthless but maybe i need to value my self first.. 

i worry so much about others liking me.. 
if it was one person that didnt like me it would be fine but its every fucking one..

no one values me or gives me attention.. its like they are too cool for me.. i feel like im out of their league..i just feel they will never ever give a f about me or put effort into me.

Dont know if this will be changed with positive self talk.. i dont know how to change it.

But maybe im just boring and uninteresting and maybe its not their fault..i dont know how to change this. 

Or i dont know how to talk like a normal fucking human being. I would get scared to talk to a girl, like how do you get girls to chase you like crazy? They dont even become my friend.. they see me as someone so low. And im scared to get a job. Im such a pussy.

I have no charisma, no being witty, or i cant be chicky or i cant be funny and creative wth my jokes im not fun maybe cringe af and i never have banter with anyone, i dont know how to do any of these.. i dont have confidence in me i have no self esteem no social skills but a boring/bland personality.. i dont even know why i say somethings that i say.. i dont know my identity.. dont know my self how do i achieve these things?

People stick around cause they feel bad for my stupid/boring ase
Its one sided friendships and always one sided conversations.. i hate this and feel frustrated and feel alone and feel worthless. I feel like i have always have to be funny to keep the friends that i might make otherwise they would get bored..
I never worry about my self but other person. Guess girls like guys who love themselfs or ones who are jerks cause they are interesting unlike my vulgar and crass personality.

People make it seem so easy and everytime i encounter someone i think why i cant be like them.. they get girls easily get friends easily..

Everytime i see w picture or a Coouple i ask my self why i dont have a GF.. honestly i think i should like being alone but cant get myself of thinking this way.",15May2019,3
121,I never had someone I knew pass away so close. I knew him for 3 years.. just heard from my boss few hours ago that he had passed away. I'm not sure how to take this whirlpool of emotions. He and I didn't get along for 2 years then finally connected.. he completed his training yesterday and now he was just about to get into the job force again. I feel defeated.. drained..I know how hard he was working toward his goal..he was so close..,15May2019,3
123,"I was walking home from work today when I was stopped by 2 Spanish speaking tourists. They had a paper map (yes, really) and pointed at a section of it known as the Museum Campus in Chicago, where the Adler Planetarium, Shedd Aquarium, and Field Museum are. 

They used simple Spanish and pointed at the map. Once I realized they just wanted directions to the Museums, I motioned that they needed to go north a block, then turn right, and they’ll come across the underpass, and once they cross that, they’ll be at the Museum Campus. They thanked me and left. I hope they found the museums ok and that they enjoyed their time in Chicago! I hope more people visit Chicago! We’re actually quite friendly!",15May2019,3
124,"I had them, yesterday. Yesterday wasn't unlike any other day where I hadnt lost my key. 

Yet there i was, key lost. Im looking for it. I feel like a faliure because despite being completely scatter brained, and zoned out about most things, I am always sure about the location of my phone, wallet, and keys. 

I take my parent's car to work. They scold me about being immature. I feel bad. Im always trying to be responsible. I quite literally don't go more than an hour without making sure i know where my phone, wallet and keys are. I have to know. 

So I get to work- i just started and im learning the basics. Trying my best to get the ins and outs down. 

I leave, and come home to look for my keys. Surely they aren't that lost. A half hour. An hour. An hour and a half. My anxiety is rising, and i'm losing grip on my anxiety. I get so angry, that I lift my twin matress off the floor and throw it across the room (to look around and under it). The keys arent there. Im freaking out. I want my keys. 
Throughout the search, I am also constantly forgetting where I placed my wallet, and as such, had to take breaks to find my wallet. 

Phone. Wallet. Keys. Phone. Wallet. Keys.

I was getting more desperate because I wanted to go to the gym (exercise is my main form of mental relief). I couldnt go because my car is the only car with a parking sticker.

Desperately, I asked my mom is she maybe took the keys, thinking they were hers. She says no. She prays to this weird saint guy, and says that if the keys come out, I'll have to dance to appease the saint. 

I told her i didnt believe in that saint. She got mad at me and she told me to just pray about it, which upset me more because it triggered strong memories of conversion therapy ( my mom sent me to conversion therapy 2 years ago and i still get nightmares, but that's  a WHOLE other story).
The memories kept flooding back so I slammed my fists into the counter several times, and then tried to take some of my dad's pills to pass out/die. I was too much of a coward to take anything so i decided to ride my bike until i passed out of heat exhuastion so I left my house (phone, wallet, house key). But had to go back because i panicked about not wearing  sunblock. 
Who attempts to get heat exhuastion while wearing sunblock? 

Regardless, I by mile 7, I was feeling better so i came back home. I rode 16 miles. 

Im just really fuckin tired and i still havent found my keys.",15May2019,5
