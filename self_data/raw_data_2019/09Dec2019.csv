1,"# Few  years ago I met some Iranians when I contested for one of the World    International Robotic Competitions (not going to say which competition    exactly it was on). During the competition I talked to an Iranian woman who took part in the Iranian team and she said exactly this line above to me when I asked her if that was really a choice as some Muslims use to say.

2,I moved to the U.S. like a year back and although I was very excited about this life in the beginning I hate it now. I am senior in high school and have decent grades but have no passion in life. I applied to a bunch of colleges but have no idea what I want to study and just applied because my parent wanted me to. I have no close friends and feel like people who I hang out don’t care about me which makes me hate going to school in general. I have also stop texting or calling my friends from back home and I don’t really think they miss me. I am insecure about my accent and always feel like people are judging me. I am also not that close to parents which sucks. I used to be an extremely introverted person and now all I do is watch YouTube videos all day. Any advice is appreciated.,09Dec2019,1
5,"So I’m in the military. We have to do “annual training “ which includes shit like anti terrorism, violence prevention, sex trafficking etc. every year it’s the same exact class. 

I’m currently doing the anti terrorism and they’re taking about what you should do and they give scenarios. 

One of them is, “the route you have planned is having major construction and is a 3 hour delay, what should  you do?” One option was, “get a current map of the city and plan another route” another was “get GPS and proceed with the safest route available “ I chose the GPS one and it was wrong.. 

Apparently, you need to get a map in 2020 and plan out tour route, gps adds no safety value (and a piece of paper does..?) 

Then another is, you’re in town for a conference and you get a hotel, what should you do? Answer was, “get a room in the 3rd or 5th floor” bruh lmao how paranoid r u 

Same scenario, but this time someone knocks you ask who it is, they say they’re employees with complimentary drinks. What should u do? Answer- don’t answer and call the front desk to confirm they’re really employees. 

Same scenario- what should you do when you first get to your room? Answer- check for any bugs/listening devices and cameras. 

BRUH LMFAO how paranoid are you? Yes, I get they’re like ok to do but come on, how often does a lance cpl need to be THAT paranoid?",09Dec2019,1

I've recently realized that I have no tolerance anymore to my anxieties and fear. And when I'm inside my apartment for days at a time, I'm just beating myself up and getting no positive reinforcement. 
Once this was pointed out to me I knew I had to get a plan in place to immerse and confront my fear. I get out now at least 3 times a week for at least a 30 min walk. And tomorrow I'm signing up for a college class.

15,"I just want to vent a bit. 

I have this amazing quality. I get very obsessed. It's an amazing quality and an extreme bad quality at the same time. Say I'm learning some new skill. For example, programming, or studying for an exam (I'm in college). Say I get stuck in a problem and can't figure out how to solve. You can bet hell and high water I will not sleep, will not eat, will not pick up my phone or open my door, at least until I can understand it. I may still not be able to solve it 100% perfectly, but until I feel like I ""get"" it, I close down. A very bad part of this is that it destroys me psychologically temporarily. Until I get to the place where I have it figured down, you don't want to talk to me. I'm extremely irritated and angry. Actually for the first few minutes after I figure I'm not understanding the problem, I will break down internally and get extremely frustrated with myself. It includes screaming into a pillow to fits of crying or random laughter, and then I pick myself up and go onto youtube or start following an online course or anything until I have it fixed, no matter how long it takes.

I was in therapy for a bit and talked about this. Therapist asked if I ever hurt myself or anyone else or actually broke something. I said no and she said it was just part of an obsessive personality and there was not realistically anything to do about it except not letting it go to extremes.

And this wouldn't be really that bad if only I had some sense of discipline. But I guess part of this is a sense of urgency and a need of ""knowing everything"". Ridiculous example. I'm an online poker player. I don't play a lot, I have the window minimized while I'm studying and it pops up when it's my turn, so I can write or study or do whatever in the meantime. The thing is, a while ago, I won a pretty big tournament after being qualified for it. So now I decided I need to learn about how to actually play the game to win again. And we're not talking about ""Reading one or two articles daily"". No. This is my new goal. It being my new goal, I've been studying 4-6+ hours every day and sleeping 5-6 hours. To study poker. Would there be any problem if I said ""Well, I'll study poker 2 hours every day if it's that important, and sacrifice, saying, playing a videogame"". But no. 

I really need to start developing some discipline. I'm very resistant to schedules. I could blame this on my personality but I'm blaming it mostly on me. I really need to start being able to divide my day into chunks of what really matters, instead of thinking everything has the same priority and not really defining hours, because then my obsession will take over and start wanting to dive deeper into a given subject and before I know I will waste a day studying one thing.

I am part of a special program at my college that gives me access to special classes intended for people in this program. These classes are more intensive but are suited for people who have a harder time in math and such. So I signed up for two of these classes because I need them both as prerequisites to apply for the school within my school. Not only am I waitlisted on both of theses classes, I am waitlisted in ALL OF MY FUCKING CLASSES. I start freaking out because I need to finish these prerequisites ASAP. Not only that but My first semester was filled with BS classes for this same exact reason. I email my advisor because surely I should have gotten the two classes for people specifically in my program. He emails me back and tells me anyone can get into those classes. ARE YOU SHITTING ME. A part of being in this special program was that I was required to do a summer term at the university whether I wanted to or not . Now anyone can get into these classes??????

20,"I (44f) am in an interesting living situation. I am married, and also have a friend that has lived with us for many years now. This friend had an 11yo and a 9yo when we all started living together.  They moved in with us not longer after their dad had passed away.  Ive treated them as I would my own children, if I had had any.

After a few years, my husband became sick and hasnt been able to work, but thanks to bad healthcare has not been able to qualify for disability, either. We went through a foreclosure and bankruptcy as a result. I went back to school full time while working full time and now have been able to make enough to purchase a home. The kids are now grown and each have a child of their own. One has been living with us the whole time with their SO.

The best way I can describe the relationships is that I am a kinda sorta step-grandma. I love the little ones.

Less than a month ago, the oldest grandchild's (2 1/2yo) mom died. Now they are living with us again. My house consists of me, husband, friend, kid #1, grandkid #1, kid #2, boyfriend of kid #2, and grandkid #2 (under 1 year old)

While I love then all, I am wore out!!  I am also going deeper and deeper into debt without anyone else in the house being worried about it. There are also so many people in the house that there never seems to be a moment of quiet.

22,"I know I cannot be the only one that experiences this, and so I desperately want to know how you guys are able to pull it off.

We all are going to die at some point. We all likely make our living doing something we are not really passionate or interested in. Good chance what we devote the majority of our adult lives to will generate some degree of stress or general malaise. We all are different from our likely more carefree, energetic younger selves. We all likely have some lack of interests or hobbies or much to do outside of work. We all are born without a specific bigger purpose and so our best bet is just to get by day-to-day with shorter goals.

So why am I so incompetent at just living with that? Life itself shouldn't be this difficult; just fucking live and roll with the waves until you die. So why am I so despondent over the notion of living or the future that I continue to waste what limited time I have angsting over it? 

Yeah, my current school/work environment is stressful, but so is pretty much everyone else's. I lack consistent and/or sustained interests or hobbies or long-term goals, but that should not be enough for me to feel so angsty over.

34,"What is a good roommate and what is not? This is something I learned the hard way during my single days, I thought I would get on here and share.

A good roommate, in my opinion, is one who is first and foremost, trustworthy. He or she is honest and does not touch your personal property without advance permission. You can trust them to never enter your room to borrow, steal or otherwise move your things, and you never have to worry about things being missing or moved when you're gone.

A good roommate will have a steady job and handles and is very responsible, in that, he or she pays his or her share of the rent, utilities on time; supports the food costs as needed and does NOT take advantage of the friendship(s) by stalling or *routinely* asking his or her roommates to cover their share of rent or household bills until later. 

A good roommate understands the concept of ""boundaries... which covers a wide range of territory in terms of your personal life, personal business and personal relationships. They do not ask nosy questions or give unsolicited or unwanted advice unless the friendship has grown close enough and to the extent where such questions are acceptable. They will also never... ever... mess around with your boyfriend, girlfriend or anyone they already know you have been involved with on an intimate level. The code is ""real.""

A good roommate knows when to contact one of your relatives (is known) when you are sick or wind up in the type of trouble that a relative should be aware of and be involved.

By the same token, a good roommate will keep your personal secrets to him or herself and discuss them with no one but you... ever. He or she knows the difference between a personal secret and something that must be revealed in the interest of your well-being, health or life.

If you select the right people as roommates, then you wind up with more than a roommate... you might just come out of it with a friend... but be careful... everything I wrote above is based on the ""ideal roommate"" which is not that easy to find at times. You must also be very careful about moving in with friends because you will learn things about them you never knew... things that you could find to be a complete turn-off... and things that could end the friendship. It is therefore best to discuss your full range of likes and dislike very openly and honestly with the person or people you are thinking about sharing a living space with in advance to determine if living together will be in the best interest of the friendship as well as your own sanity or not. Be selective for your own good.",09Dec2019,1

The way to hold it, the line to follow, measure twice cut once. My father in law was surprised that I knew how to cut and asked ""who taught you that?"" I was tearing up saying ""my dad.""

41,"I'm 18 and there's a number of things I would like to do with my life. My issue is that, no matter where I go or what I choose, there's ALWAYS a chance that it might not work out as well as I expect it to. This might or might not mean that I'll eventually have to give up and deal with working all my time away and not being able to do very much else, just like everyone else.

Since I can't stop thinking this, it's almost impossible for me to commit to an idea. I can't cope with the fact that success is not guaranteed.

Ever since I've had to start thinking seriously about my future, I've always elected to make the absolute safest choice. Go to college, study computer science because it's (almost) the only degree that practically guarantees a proper job where you can use it.

This plan has never had anything to do with my passions, but I've found it to be enough until recently. It's become increasingly clear that, deep down, I want \*more\*. This ""want"" has grown so much that I no longer feel that I can accept to live the safe and boring life I've been setting up for myself. I now feel obligated either to achieve success by following my dreams or to REFUSE to even live.

Now, this mentality is extremely toxic towards my thought process in planning things for myself. Every time I feel like doing something new, I instinctively bombard myself with thoughts like: ""Well? Is this your golden ticket?""; ""Can you ever hope to be the best at this?""; ""Is it worth the effort?""; ""Do you enjoy this enough to fight for it?""; ""What's your plan? Is it perfect? Cause you can forget it if there's even the slimmest chance it might not work out"". Obviously, these can only lead to negative conclusions, especially when it's about an idea I've never acted on at all, since I have no experience to show for it besides my imagination.

This destroys my motivation, my creativity, my perspective, everything. I can't have casual hobbies because I'll always hate not being a real professional. I can't think about a career because it always involves hard work that I can't justify.

So... I'm stuck.",09Dec2019,1
42,"I've had people hang up the phone on me when I call them sobbing because I was literally just about to kill myself. I've had them tell me I'm being dramatic, looking for attention, or tell me I'm putting too much pressure on them by telling them my feelings. These are all from the only people who I've ever been close with.



I've been in the wake of multiple suicides and even more deaths in general. People just compete to show who cared more, who's affected more, etc. And they just act like they did EVERYTHING they could. When really just a simple ""Morning, hope your day is ok!"" might've saved them. Such tiny things that are way too much to be assed with apparently, even when it's literal life or death. And you could say they didn't know how to help but I've given such direct, specific requests or suggestions of the smallest things and still. I even had a friend ask me to write down little easy things she could do and I did and she never did any of them. She probably just wanted the note so if I died she could say ""Look I was helping!""



So I've come to the conclusion that people only care about depression when it affects THEM. That's why they say ""Suicide doesn't get rid of your pain it just spreads it"" like that matters at all to a suicidal person. That's something to say to people to get them to care about a suicidal person, not to the suicidal person to get them to live. I don't care. That's just selfish anyway because you're suggesting I'm more deserving of pain than the people around me




Guarantee, 100%, and you can't change my mind on this, nobody would experience as much pain at my death as I'm feeling now. They're not gonna kill themselves over it. They'll grieve for a little while and then get over it. Maybe think about it occasionally and feel a tinge of sadness for a moment on the anniversary every year. 



Who cares. 




So if they then will have less pain then it makes even less sense to say that. Each individual affected will feel MUCH less pain than I do now. 



It's like I'm carrying a truck on my shoulders and someone says ""don't set that down because if you do then these 80 other people will have to carry it together and that be mighty inconvenient!"" 



People only care when it affects them. If you're suffering to the maximum degree that a human can that's preferable to them being hurt slightly. They just want you to suffer in silence and leave them alone",09Dec2019,1

46,"Throwaway account because my friends will probably be able to figure out who I am and probably know my main account.

To preface this, I’m in pretty good shape, have a ton of friends, am generally pretty smart and go to a competitive university so I have no reason to have suddenly lost all motivation and be depressed. Grew up in a loving home with everything I could’ve ever asked for and more but I’ve wasted it all away despite getting second chance after second chance. My anxiety has gotten to extreme levels where I cannot function and I just failed out of my major in school, if not entirely from the university and I don’t know what to do.

I’ll make this as short as I can. I’m not suicidal but I am completely hollow inside, my parents and friends are all great people and I can’t bear to think about how my mom and dad would be if I were to kill myself or just go missing so I just won’t. I don’t want to die but living is just exhausting and I’m constantly lying to make myself seem alright.

Last semester I got put on academic suspension after I basically lost all motivation to work and my anxiety built up to the point where I would experience what I assume are anxiety attacks where I couldn’t function. Too embarrassed to admit this to anyone (even my professors) so I basically just failed all of my classes. I took the easiest summer course I could and got back in for this semester so none of my friends or family even knew what happened except for my parents and sister. Now it’s happening again except I won’t be able to recover and it’s far too late to do anything about it.

In the past 2 years I’ve probably gotten about 50 days total where I reached 8 hours of sleep, usually I only get 5-6 which definitely doesn’t help.

The last few weeks I’ve been hit with projects and tests at a crippling rate and I just shut down and stopped working entirely. I’ve been running cross country and track for 9 years now and yet I can barely move myself up a set of stairs because my brain just says, “Why bother using the energy?”

I can’t tell my parents or (god forbid) my poor grandmother because they’ll be absolutely crushed, money wasted aside, and I’ve been straight up lying to all of my friends for over a year now so I feel like I can’t turn to them or else I’ll break down and lose them.

Literally my whole life is a tragic joke waiting to collapse and there’s nothing I can do about it anymore. On the bright side, I’ve got a sense of humor and a high school diploma so cheers to me getting the most mediocre job that I can find.

If you read this, thank you for your time because I lied when I said that I would make it short.",09Dec2019,1
47,"I(24M) am doing a two-year degree in japan and this semester it has been quite lonely. Im holed up in the lab, I dont live in the dorm anymore, and I have no classes with the other international students. Most of them are short termers (6months to a year). I have made no friends since October, when they arrived.

Two weeks ago I was sitting in a bench in a packed cafe, when a nice (23M) European dude, doing a medicine-internship thingy for four months. I enjoyed the conversation and when I shook his hand before  we parted, I said “was nice talking to you.” Which he replied with “was it?” it a surprised (not rude) voice.

He accepted my fb friend request and I asked if hed like to join me for lunch. He said he has a full day but thanked me for the invite. That was a big step for me, as i think i probably have mild social anxiety. 

Anyways it upsets me how I made a new friend and hes going home soon. When i got turned down i started overthinking, wondering if he was really busy or of if he wasnt interested. Was I the only one who enjoyed the conversation? 

Now I just feel so lonely and pathetic. Any advice on how to get out of this funk?

Thanks

OK like I'm not upset, but it is a bummer. I met this awesome girl online. Yeah, I know the old bit goes ""How do you know it's not a gay guy pretending to be a guy"" cause that doesn't phase me. But she said ""I'm a trans boy weirdly enough"" and I said that's cool. We met in a hentai server and just started to talk. So I guess she's bi. She said she wanted to screw around. I was like ""But I bet you're not in GA""    
""Nope! In Cali"" 

""welp bummer"" :) me :) but actually  ;\_;   


NOW, yeah I'm 27, and I could easily be like ""I'll drive myself there."" I have thought about going cross country anyways... I have met some awesome people. Maybe I'll get my car fixed up and might do it. It wouldn't be a bad idea. I have the money to do it but I'll wait till after now and my birthday in Jan. I have some internet friends I wanna see. I would love to go out and see them, TX cali, maybe WA and NY. Be a lot of fun.

I have been growing out hair for a year, and it is hard to tuck into the cap, so I decided i want to start shaving head bald to make it easier. but everyone objects to this for some reason. My dad says it's ""Extreme"", and him and employees and store owner all suggested getting a ""nice and short"" haircut, saying i'm a ""good looking guy"" etc... but I don't like short hair, and I don't even want to be a ""good looking guy"".

it's just weird, this objection I'm getting. Like, it would be okay to cut hair to a short length, but not okay to completely get rid of it? Being shaved head wouldn't be bad because we all wear caps anyway. I'm probably gonna shave it, because I really don't like short hair. Won't get fired, but employees and store owner might think I'm weird.

56,"My boyfriend went to an out of state rehab for three months about a year ago. He didn’t have his phone but we were able to write letters to each other. Then he moved to another state to live in a sober living home for the last 9 months, and is now finally back home.

Obviously this has been a crazy year both of us. 

Alright, normally I wouldn’t mind my bf having other female friends. However, his drug use did lead to him cheating on me once.

The sober living home my boyfriend lived at was an old renovated sorority house, so there were up to 20-25 guys living there. The “girls” house was right next door, but was smaller so there were only about 5-10 girls living there. The boys house had a lot of space to hang out, a kitchen and an eating area. Girls were allowed only on the first floor of the boys house. 

My bf and I met in an outpatient therapy program so I’m highly aware that group therapy and other activities can get really deep and emotional. This is why I’m struggling with all of this, I completely understand the type of relationships that are built while in treatment. Even if their not meant to last forever they can mean a lot in the moment. 

I ended up finding out that my bf had been texting/snapchatting a couple girls that lived next door. (We have an open phone policy since the cheating) I had no idea he had been texting and snapchatting other girls until he was about to move out of the house. He says their just friends, but there’s a couple girls who just rubbed me the wrong way.

-RANT-
 (I know this is off topic but I need to rant ha. One girl immediately gave him her number and added him on Snapchat. Whenever they were around each other she would take videos of him and post them. She would randomly text him late at night just “because”. She made cookies for everyone in the house but made a separate batch to give to my bf specifically. She worked at an ice cream shop and was always bringing him free/discounted ice cream. She asked my bf about me and our relationship a lot. And she was always bringing up how she wants to style my bf’s hair. She also offered to pluck his eyebrows one night. I know, totally wrong subreddit but thanks for listening.)

What would you guys do if you had people you know since birth threated them like brothers you and your families were very good and now all of sudden they start turnin on you because you go to better schools you have actually a sight for a good and fulfilling life.

They start messin with chicks you actually had something with, things were even lookin good between her and you but they come all of a sudden and start writin her without you knowin, they aint even tellin it to you but still act like your brothers but behind you they talk shit.

They start to make fun of you because you did some mistakes in the past and now they try to define you with those mistakes. Everybody makes mistakes and i learnt from them.

I dunno i didnt do anything and from my nature i cant do something to destroy someone others life i dont want to waste my energy on it because it means nothing to me and it brings no good to me. 
I wont fight them and i know from speaking with them makes things worse because they start talking behind your back like you assaulted them or something and they just then act like they are better people.

Everyone is the same, nobody is better or worse i dont get it. 

Im not saying im quitting my things i have going on (school etc.) and im not depressed i have my family after all they are my best friends but it bothers me and i want to know what you think those people are up to.

It just seems Snake like to me and very jealuosly. I dont know how i should handle this problem after all our families know each other since before i was born. I surely wont fight them and surely dont want anything bad to happen. And we are not children and i wont go now to they parents because those people should be adults i wont surely go tell the problems to their famillies, maybe they know it even i dont know.
It is at first because of my family that i dont want any beef because my parents have been through a lot (Mother Cancer, Fahter Back Problems) i dont want them to have concerns about anything.

63,"""Life, and ultimately death, are feared, revered, and every attempt is made to understand our purpose and role.  We are told we only live once, we are told we are destined to die and our light will be extinguished as we know it.  I beg to differ; we live, and die, many times in the course of one lifespan.  It is necessary, for the experience would be lacking if we did not.  As a tree grows, does it not die?  Does the covering that protected its tender beginings not shed, slough off, and harden?  Does it not endure the ""pain"" of its growth as it pushes the boundary of its surroundings?  It searches for the light with its leaves, pushes them upon ever growning branches into the most beneficial position within the canopy; while at the same time its roots push, expand, and search for water and nutrients.  Is it not amazing that the precious oxygen that the tree creates in the air, it must find in the ground to thrive, survive even?  Are we, or any living creature, really so different?  Parts of us will die; our cells constantly shed and regenerate, but what of our heart, our soul, our very being?  We leave pieces of them throughout our lives, and we grieve their loss as though we can never move forward, never survive with the remnants.  As for me, this is how I will measure my life, for it is with those very pieces that we have nourished others, shaped their lives as well as ours, created our legacy.  Just as the leaves that fall from the tree slowly decompose and feed many organisms around the tree, which in turn create the most favorable conditions for the tree's growth, so do those pieces that we leave behind.  For each person we love, we give them a piece of our heart, and whether they remain in our lives or not, that piece is forever lost.  For every passion, a piece of our soul is dedicated to the endeavor, never to be returned.  We leave these trails within our past, and set the pieces in the present, all to be forsaken by us in the future.  Many fear the loss as though it was in vain, but I declare it was not!  To have lived a life of purpose, of passion, of love, we MUST leaves these trails, like pieces of bread to mark a trail we shall never tread again, yet we must mark as we walk.  We must leave the nourishment in our wake.  A successful life is not what we possess when we physically die, but what we DON'T possess is the true measure.  I for one hope that when I am called Home, as the last breath rattles from within me and the light of my existence leaves my worn eyes, I hope, no, I pray, that I am left with but one shard of my heart in my left hand, and the last fragment of my soul in my right.  It is with these small tokens, the last vestiges of my existence, that I will measure how much I gave to the world, and I pray I give it all.......""",09Dec2019,1

I'm not sure why I had hoped, that day of all days, you'd decide to reach out. Wishful thinking I guess, that maybe we'd get you back. 

I miss you, who you used to be. Before the drama and the drugs, before the arrests and the anger. I miss my dad, who would be ecstatically happy when I'd come by randomly just to say hi because I had free time and we'd just talk about life until the early morning hours. 

Before I left for Maryland, you told me you had developed a drug problem. That you didn't want to embarrass us kids, but that you were going to rehab. I told you I wasn't embarrassed, but I was PROUD of you. We cried and talked and hugged it out, and off I went for my next adventure and as far as I knew, you were clean. 

Then..you relapsed. And it was like..you forgot who I was, that I was your daughter who loved and cared for you and that I had feelings and emotions. When I would call every day, just to make sure you were alive; when you would tell me in excruciating detail all the different ways you would try to kill yourself, and how you were sad that it never quite worked out..I cannot even find the right way of explaining how that absolutely broke me.

I cried for you, screamed and beat my fists against the walls. All of us kids have worried ourselves sick over you, but you still would ask..why? Like you just couldn't fathom it..that we truly loved our father. 

And well, you're missing your babies grow up dad. You've missed most of that beautiful little girls life who's your only grandbaby. You missed your youngest daughter, my beautiful and AMAZING little sister, announcing her second pregnancy. You missed the absolutely awe-inspiring moment in that tiny cramped room where we were all staring up at this screen watching a baby kick and move in her belly and her tell them to calm it because that crap hurts. You missed that absolute feeling of honor when you're trusted with the privilege of knowing that that little alien thing right there? That's a baby girl, and I just know she's going to be smart and beautiful just like her mommy and sister. 

You missed out on my engagement, and you weren't there when it didn't work out. You weren't there to pull me out of that blind, self-destructive rage I felt. My family was though, my amazing siblings and my amazing mother. 

I was really lucky with that one, that I managed to get the mom I did. She picked up that slack that was left, being a split home. She raised me into who I am today. Just like all the other amazing women who raised my siblings, we wouldn't be who we were today if it weren't for you.

Anyway for the last year I’ve been watching my baby cousin (BC) for my cousin (her mom who we’ll call M) and my aunt. They were struggling with money, so for the first couple months they said they would try to pay me. In those 3-4 months they only gave me $40, which was ok because I knew they were struggling. However eventually they didn’t feel the need to pay me anything and said I need to start doing more housework along with watching BC. When I asked them if they could at least give me $50 a MONTH. They acted like it was the end of the world. They have money to buy name brand things for themselves and BC as well as have enough to eat out every week, but they can’t each give me $25 a month? When I told that I felt used they shamed me basically. They told me I saw how they were struggling financially and I’m family so they shouldn’t have to pay me anyway. I fell for their manipulation and they said they would try to compromise and give me a little. For the last 3-4 months I only received $40. Eventually told them just forget about it, because every time I walked into the room they would start talking about how they are going to afford this and that then mention paying me to make feel bad. I fell so deep into their lies mostly because everyone else tells me to get over it or that it’s not a big deal except my grandma (who has took over my “job” whenever I am too busy). My grandma was the only one who felt like I was justified, and I’m so grateful for her. She’s the only person not making me feel insane. Everyone might be wondering why don’t I just leave, but I love BC and I don’t want to punish her because of M and my aunt. I don’t want them to throw her in the cheapest daycare or have my clumsy aunt or grandma watching her.
Two important things also happened recently we found out who’s BC’s dad and I got my drivers license. BC’s dad makes good money and decided he was buying BC (who is 1) an IPad and M and $1,000 purse for Christmas. But when I asked each of them for $20 for my 18th birthday it was to much. And although BC’s dad has no real obligation towards me I have a good relationship with him and I have been watching his child for free basically for a year now. Side note nobody remember my birthday but my other aunt, mom, and my only friend (I am not joking I have serve social anxiety and I only have one friend). That shit really hurt. Anyway I asked if they can all put together $100 to put towards a car for me, but we can all guess how that went. My aunt decided she did have enough to buy M some new Ugg’s tho. It’s so upsetting, because getting a car is my only way to escape this situation. I can’t get a job without a car and I can’t get a car without money. My sister got a free car from my dad, but he quit his good job to work at a fast food restaurant (nothing wrong with fast food workers, but he has multiple degrees and certifications as well as multiple kids he needs to provide for). He said he is willing to give $200, but he always promises money and never gives anything. It sucks because I’m going to have to put literally every cent of savings into this car and nobody is willing to help except my mom and grandma. A quick rant about my mom though, she ignores me any time I try and talk to her about anything, she constantly tells me I’m over dramatic even if I just say something like my head hurts, she told me to just get over my anxiety and depression, and doesn’t believe in me when it comes to my future (which is realistic goal a lot easier than becoming a doctor)
I’m just so tired of this I want a car so I can get a job and hopefully be happy. Recently my friend told me she can’t wait to she how her life would turn out in 20 years, but I can’t even imagine mine. I don’t even have the desire to live that long at this point. I can’t even remember the last time I was happy for over 2 days. I’ve tried to be helpful to everyone, completed two years of college early with good grades, try to be an overall good person, yet I still get shitted on constantly. Nothing hurts worst than when the people you live and care about most manipulates you, uses you, and just doesn’t care about you.

71,"Tonight was a weird one. Normally, Sundays at the bar are dead and pretty boring. We have a dozen or so regulars who work odd schedules so they have Mondays off and spend all day at the bar watching football and then drinking until they can barely stand. They were hanging out when I showed up, and nothing about the rest of the patrons seemed too out of place. But I should have anticipated things would be off when I saw two raccoons walk by the bar shortly after I got there. I'd never actually seen raccoons in person before. They're bigger than I expected.

An Uber minivan pulled up at about 9:30 dropped off six young Europeans from various countries. I made pleasantries and a Dutchman said they were there to get over their loss that day. It turned out they were all professional esports players who compete in a game called Battalion 1944. A game nobody in North America cares about, but they like competing here because it's a free trip to Southern California. Ten minutes later another team from the same tournament shows up. And then twenty minutes later the North America teams start showing up. Eventually, we have forty 20something-year-old video game players in the bar. Having forty young, competitive, drunk, dudes together is rarely a recipe for good things. 

About an hour into this group showing up a few were hanging outside having a smoke when the crazy lady from last week who asked me to spread my seed with her shows up. She's strolling by the bar with an open can of Coors light and once again starts begging people for cigarettes. I instruct them all to not give her anything because she needs to leave the property. She's not happy with this and I get the sense she no longer wants me to fuck her as she cusses me out about it. I tell her I'm going to call the cops (I won't really, but she doesn't know this). I pull out my phone and she proceeds to throw the remainder of her beer at me and starts walking quickly away.
The Europeans ask me if this is normal. They had already been concerned about our dress code not allowing gang attire, and I would later find out they switched hotels because the Quality Inn was too sketchy for their tastes. I assured them it was only the norm of late, but the area really wasn't that bad. I neglected to tell them a dude was shot and killed last year across the street. 

At this time the old random dude at the bar who keeps telling me random unfunny jokes comes out for a cigarette and I tell him not to give the lady any if she asked. He asks me if the crazy lady is my sister. I tell him she's not that crazy.

The rest of the night is madness as we only have two girls working since two other girls called out sick. I'm stuck doing dishes because we don't have enough Stella glasses to satisfy our influx of Belgians. 

Around midnight the Americans decide they need to settle a pool bet outside. I go out to make sure it's nothing crazy and immediately see a dude pulling his pants down. bare ass and balls hanging out as he's getting spanked by another dude. Mr. Spanked is a big talker and says he wants to make his bet back base on his high kicking ability. He says he can probably kick the tall Dutchman (probably 6'6"") in the head if he needed to. The Dutchman isn't having any of it though, thankfully.

I thought my night already had enough random wildlife when I'm standing there and an Owl just floats over the group and lands on the bar. Owls are not normal here, so another obscure thing. 

1: 30: Last call finally comes and 30 of the video gamers are still in the bar. At 1:40 a regular who hadn't been in all night comes up to the bar. I tell him we're done serving. He says he just needs to talk to someone and then starts crying.

The girls are already in the backroom so it's just me, 30 rowdy gamers, and one dude crying at the bar. Crying guy tells me his kid just died and it's his birthday. Crying dude is a compulsive liar and I feel bad for not believing him, but I've known him seven years and he's never mentioned a kid. Also, this kid is supposed to be six years old and the product of an ex-wife, that again, I've never been told about in seven years of him coming to the bar.

Mind you, Crying guy has ""been"" a firefighter, cop, band member, motocross racer, etc, all in the last year. He's never told the truth about anything. Also, I'm friends with him on Facebook and he has no pictures with kids. This smells fishy. I think he really just wants sympathy from one of the girls.

I have to kick him out with everyone else but he asks me to go to get food because he might kill himself tonight. I say I'll text him when we're done cleaning. I tell the girls what happened and they both just assume it's bullshit and don't want to get food with him. 

When we leave the bar this dude is still waiting, and he's now talking to one of the gamers from Belgium. Bless this random gamer's heart, he's been dealing with crying dude for 30 minutes while we clean. 

The two girls peace out and I ask if he still wants to get food. Belgian dude tags along. I end up hearing a total bullshit story about a kid that probably doesn't exist dying. Belgian dude happens to mention that he spent a year in Nashville once. Crying dude mentions that his kid's name was Nash, named for Nashville.....of course.
Belgian dude pays this guy's tab, and I drive Belgian dude to his less sketchy hotel and let him know that Crying guy's whole story was probably bullshit.

78,"I recently met this guy while doing community work and we spent the entire day delivering bags around the area and talking the entire time. It’s the first time I’ve realised how much I like talking to intelligent guys, not academically, but just someone who has the same level of understanding as I do about certain topics such that I don’t have to re-explain concepts which I think are basic. All of my exes so far have been really different from me so this guy was like a breath of fresh air. 
We exchanged phone numbers, but it was more in a “hey let’s do more community work together” kind of way, and not romantically at least. 
Reflecting back on this, this encounter and the discovery that I like intelligent guys makes me feel kind of guilty in a way. Am i being overtly picky for being attracted to intelligent guys? I don’t mind being friends with people who aren’t, but I’d just prefer a partner that is.",09Dec2019,1

81,"Second time in 6 months, went to a hair salon, different ones but both high end salons with professional colourists, asked to turn my already balayage blonde hair slightly blonder and refresh the look. Both times came out a complete brunette. I don't understand so many things:

* why this causes me to have a complete emotional break down
* why is my hair colour either causing or keeping me from having an existential crisis
* why is this fairly simple requst seemingly hard to achieve by experts in the field

Both times they went through the proper steps: using bleach/developer to lift the hair aka make it blonde and then use a toner to tone. The toner seems to always make it go complete dark! Both times the hairdressers don't admit this is not what I asked for but either proceed to convince me that this is a shade of blonde just darker, or that I didn't ask for blonde or (and this is the kicker) I can't be blonde!!!! I have been blonde most of my life. Why can't they at least admit their mistakes!

86,"Hey Self! I just wanted to kinda vent here and hear some similiar stories if there are any.

My particular choice of trade is film. I decided in lieu of college to go directly into set lighting, I won't say which department in particular. Anyway,  I'm young as hell compared to everyone else I work with. I'm 20 and I've been doing the job since I was 17 on small budget things with a younger workforce, but recently I've been working on big shows so I meet a lot of older people which is great and it's everything I dreamed! I have the utmost respect for all of them and I appreciate everything they tell me. I've come to realize that the people I work with on real jobs (actual professionals) are generally just pissed, been doing the job for decades, and just tell me what to do all the time, which is fine because obviously I'm the youngest guy and I'm actually younger than what's considered the youngest too. I'm very lucky with the opportunities I've been granted and I make a lot of money, so I'm not in a bad spot. I'd also like to make clear that I definitely don't suck,
and a film student grad probably wouldn't fair better, especially since I've been doing the job for a while already and I'm still getting called up. 

I'm not sure if it's my demeanor, but I kinda just get treated like the young guy all the time? I do my best to shut up, not talk too much at all, be optimistic and eager to do my best, learn what I don't know and be humble and non-know it all and accept that everyone I'm working with is just better than me because of their experience and I listen to them. I occasionally try to act like a normal person and say a few things that make me seem like not a complete quiet weirdo but that's few and far in-between. I always do my best to be the fastest/most efficient guy, and not let the fact that the commotion of the job scares me shitless sometimes and I do my best to not let it show on my face, because apparently that's a thing and it's 
fine. To clarify, I do my best to do all of the above with class, professionalism, being calm, and tasteful. But sometimes it just doesn't feel like it's enough and I'm just always going to be the dumb kid who they bring around because they know he'll eventually replace them in 5-10 years time and I'm not sure if I'm kept around because I'm some sort of vanguard or if I'm actually good at my job. There's plenty of other people who I know are better studio mechanics than me, but they seem to keep me around anyway.


I'm not trying to sound like I'm super good, I literally just do what I'm told to do with aggression and confidence like I learned. What's also difficult is, I'm so happy to be there and it always just makes me seem like I'm sucking dick, which I'm not, I'm just actually happy to be chilling and doing some cool shit, so that's why I generally just shut up and speak minimally and efficiently.

I'd really love to hear if anyone has experienced this before, I feel like I'm going insane.",09Dec2019,1

I remember the things I used to cherish, the things that felt golden.  Funny how simple, yet so complex, the term ""Never Again"" can affect fate itself.  One can be torn away from the light and strewn in a darker path in life in the matter of hours.  You know it could never be the same, and what you had is gone.  All of it makes me wonder if I'll ever see the same fate again, or if I have found my ""End"" and now walk a lonely road.

90,"So my (19M) older sister (20F) has recently been on a surge of toxic behavior specifically directed towards me. She has always been very stubborn and refused to accept whenever she was wrong. She'd get really insensitive in conversations at times and they'd usually end in here yapping till she has the last word. My mother would always tell me to just leave her be. And that's just the way she is.

Truth is, I feel my mother's neglect of the situation and my father compromising outlook just embedded my sister's behavior. There's really no point in talking to her. Once an argument begins with her, it's inevitable that it ends with her having the last word. Once it reaches a point where she drifts off of the subject at hand and starts making personal attacks like ""your just mad because you're ugly"" or ""you're not even in college/university so you're stupid"", it's just a clear sign to me that this won't go anywhere but her way.

The reason I decided to make this post now is that she has had a notable change in behavior which involved an increase in ego and personal attacks. Almost as if she has a goal to bring me down. It never really gets to me since I know my sister's judgment is that of a child's (maybe worse). But it's still irritating and is torture to put up with. These are usually signs of insecurities and lack of acknowledgment.

I’m not worried about the failing, a college degree isn’t a big deal for the industry I want to go into. I’m worried how they’ll react. I don’t know if they’ll kick me out, or just make me pay rent. I feel like a little kid, because I’m just worried I’ll get the most intense scolding of my life. I’m just really scared for the next few months because I don’t know how it will go. It’s also hard because I have nobody to blame, it’s entirely my fault. I don’t like school, it makes me depressed so instead of just doing it I just don’t.

My parents have never felt approachable, so I didn’t feel like I could tell them how I felt like I wasn’t right for college, and when I tried to hunt at it they dismissed it and said I had to go. Maybe I’m just lazy and don’t want to do the work and now that it’s biting me I’m complaining. I don’t know. Hopefully somehow something good will come out of it.

i thought i was making a progress. i thought she would understand how serious i am and that we had mutual feelings by now. that i truly care for her. but apparently not.

106,"*I'd just like to mention that I don't use reddit often so I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub or of low quality. This is also a throwaway account.*

My backstory: Hello, I am currently a student who had suffered of severe anxiety and depression, which started when I attended the ""big brainer"" school type of my country, at age 12/13. Neither of thoose mental quirks were diagnosed, because thanks to my anxiety I stayed shut about em. And yes, I did want do die for a very short time, and I am probably not that normal in my mind anymore. I've left that school after 2 years and now I am happy in an apprenticeship. I have been and still am a bit introverted with slight anxietys and depressions, I don't want to go out and meet friends alot, I rather play games, do mods and all that fun stuff a nerd does. However, I am of course way more opened up online. And I manage to deal with my problems and can make fun of myself.

So, how did I end up helping people? I would like to tell you about the following three examples.

1. My Turkish friend who was a minor

I'm a Half-Life 2 and Gmod fanboy, did sum silly and later well edited Youtube Videos (now privated in fear of coppa) and met a turkish kiddo who was a bit younger than me back then. Let's just say, he and his other online friend who was even younger got into some trouble, and my turkish friend was angry at this other younger for not being too serious about turkish kid's depression.

I won't get too much into it, but I managed to cheer him up and get him together with his friend, mutiple times now. This is because I was in his exact same situation. When I was his age, I was also in a steam  ""group"" of online friends. At some point it got really messy, I wanted to completly isolate myself form everyone of the group because of 1 to later 3 people which I constantly had arguments with, but at the end, when I opend up, I saved 2 friendships that also existed in the group which were at risks, and one of them has been a great friend, however his life is not going so well and he's kinda poor now, but I still try to make him stay sane, that is the least I can do. That was also around the time I went to hard school.

With that experience I was able to help my turkish friend, I told him some my past, and explained him what he should do. Today's chat words of him were ""Im amazed, how u can just become a therapist,teacher and a comrade"", which inspired me to do this post, he also once thanked me for ""teaching life lessons"". I really try my best to keep him happy and sane in this hard time he is in. Which I certainly wasn't back then when I was in his position, because nobody helped me.

I cannot tell you much about example 2, but let's just say, today I gave someone in my class advice while everybody was complaining.

3 is a scenario which is still on-going. I use Instagram late at night sometimes when I have insomnia again for no reason and cannot sleep, then stop at a certain time and somehow manage to sleep after like 10mins.

There is this history meme account which sometimes posted a picture of the ""feels bar"" being open, in it there are a few characters, one being pepe, so you probably know where this is going.

The top comments of course were cheap history jokes or whatever, but if you got a bit deeper, you find a bunch love pain and whatever, however I ignored that as I have never felt love before and accept it, so I feel that I should not try to help with such issue. There were certain comments however of sad stories, some I liked, some I even commented on.

On some I gave serious advice on what they should do, some I told fun activites and hobbies to do, and some I haven't given any suggestion, but told them that I respect them for staying sane. There was this one dude who seemed to have been framed and betrayed by his friends, but he stayed very ""formal"" and sane about it, so I told him that he has my respect for being like that, as I have been in such situations already and boy, they have never ended well. And I know I am helping, because I know how good it feels when someone even just pays attention to your comment, so you know atleast someone really cares. And I know how unsatisfying it is to write a text of your problems and they go into the void. So the feels bar may make some a tiny bit more desperate, but it may help some, and I am one of the helpers.

&amp;#x200B;

In my past, I feel like I have been betrayed, humiliated, used, went insane, and I tried to fight against it, and it didn't turn out pretty. Now, I sometimes help people not make the mistakes I made, or just help them stay sane so they don't end their life. I still have mental issues but I stay shut about it. And there is something that I wish to cofnfess, but I cannot as it is unexplainable. *Oh yeah, and let's just say and I am now able to understand why ""very unstable"" people are like that.*

Have a nice day, and remember, a few words you type might impact someone alot, for better or for worse.",09Dec2019,1
107,"When I graduated High School I figured university is just not for me, in fact I didn’t think I was smart enough. Which looking back is honestly hilarious.

At 27 I will finally graduate with an associates degree and I think I’m going to leave it at that. 

I come from a family of successful (middle class) folks and I always felt a pressure to finish. But for what? I like learning and will continue to learn but not for a grade. I don’t want to be graded on what I can memorize or how others perceive me. I have gone back and fourth more times I’d like to admit.

111,"I’m a (24F) law graduate from a top school in South America and I’ve been studying for the bar exam almost 8 months now (before you freak out, this is very normal in my country, and most of the students prepare the bar exam in 6-12 months full time). 

This process is what I can only describe as the closest thing to hell I’ve had to endure during my lifetime. I think before going any further, I might just explain what this torture consist about. So basically after 5 (yes FIVE!!!) entire years of law school, you are suppose to take you bar exam, which allows you to practice as a lawyer (after fulfilling another shit ton of other bs requirements). This exam is oral, and is given in front of a 3 professor commission (usually conformed by old sexist lawyers) answering questions about basically everything you learned in lawschool during the past 5 years. 

So, I’ve been locked up for the past few months, studying between 6-8 hours a day (except for the weekends), and is honestly driving me crazy. A few years into lawschool I knew the myths that surrounded this terrible experience, but never in a million years I’ve would imagine what it actually does to you until now. 

At first I trying to play it cool, and use this introspective time I was finally given (after 5 years of non stop working/studying) to make myself a better person, and overall lawyer. I joined a gym, worked on my mental health, started taking prescribed (and rightfully treated) ADHD medicine and tried balancing a well rested but also social enough life, but it finally caught up to me and I’m finding myself having restless nights, anxiety attacks and an overall unstable feeling all day, everyday (even when I’m not studying) 

I’ve seriously considered leaving everything “law” related behind, and doing something else, but I’ve invested so much into this degree (time, money, relationships, my fucking entire soul) I can’t imagine not making it. 

I have about 3 more months until my turn comes, and honestly I’m not even worried about the outcome, I just want this process to end and I can, somewhat, pick up the pieces and try to restore my normal life. 

I would really appreciate any support from internet strangers at this point, since my self esteem would take anything by this point. Also, if you are going trough something similar, hang in there. I’m sure we will make it out alive, and I hope we can laugh at this looking back.",09Dec2019,1
112,"Hi there 
I am 25 year old female from India,
this incident happened a few hours back and the entire situation is still making me frustrated and angry. 
A little back story, am visiting my parents and they took me to a shop near the school my mom teaches. She walks past this store everyday and the owners son was my moms student 10 years ago but apart from that they dont really know each other. So we went there and bought a really expensive salwar material and it needs to be tailored which they said can be done there itself. In comes the owner of the store and i could sense that she is a Karen from the way she talks to her employees. Anyway we proceed to give the instructions(this is v imp) for the salwar to be stitched. And a week later, we went there to get it. I tried it on and i realise that this is nothing like how i had asked them to make it, and it doesn’t fit me well. Basically it looks terrible and am disappointed but i didn’t show that and i asked karen about these changes from the original design and she says nothing to worry it can be fixed. Fast forward to today which is few days later. I went to the shop and tried it again. Same thing. With very minor adjustments. Karen says matter of factly ‘nothing can be done, and the tailor told me this is what you told him to do’
I very nearly lose it. (My parents are indian and do not like it if i raise my voice or argue abt well anything)  
I calmly try to say that i had specifically told the guy the design and his exact words and he even had a picture of design i had wanted. and tht i have spent quite alot of money on this (guys am broke, i bought this for my cousins wedding) and I expected some minimum quality in the tailoring because of it.
Karen says ‘see i have told you that nothing can be done now what do you want me say’
I was angry and on the verge of tears i told them this is not right, you have to fix this somehow and am very disappointed at their service. At this she snaps. She started literally yelling at me saying am being rude to her, shes yelling at my parents saying ‘this is how she talks to me at my own store, you have insulted me, how dare you insult me, i told u nothing can be done what more do you want me say’ am standing there like wait hold up you’re yelling at mee!?! 
Pls know that my parents are extremely sweet people whose worst fears include being in uncomfortable situations and disagreements of any form, they will do anything to avoid this. 
They are visibly angry at me for putting them in this situation i can feel their angry eyes and i am standing there saying ‘wait wait am telling u the facts am not being rude and i didnt mean to be rude but i cant wear this anymore and my money is gone’ but she doesnt let me finish she goes on about how am a horrible person and i have no right to talk to her rudely.
All through this i had not raised my voice or changed my tone, i was as calmly as possible talking but to no avail she wasnt letting me. My parents intervene and tells her ‘shes just desperate, doesnt have any clothes for the wedding’ and am standing there like wtff thats how u support me!? She goes on to call the tailor, yells at him in front of us says ‘if i fire him will that make you happy.’ ‘I will cut from ur salary because of this’ my parents start freaking out and starts calming her down paid the full amount. Gave me a death glare when I suggested we return the salwar and take the money back. Finally i shut the fuck up cuz am in the verge of tears. My mom as always kept pretending this is not happening gave some other stuff for tailoring, small talked with karen as we were leaving, said goodbyes, minutes after karen said all that shit about me. 
I was upset but didnt say anything. On the way back parents pretended that didnt just happen. Reached back home and i asked them why they didnt feel that needed to support me. They turned around and got super mad. Dad goes ‘do u think we dont support you?! Is that the kind of parent you think i am?!, She understood we were angry cuz i glared at them’ I was like you could have said am not rude or dont try to turn this around or anything other than am desperate for clothes . Parents got deeply offended. Dad starts over reacting saying they have failed as parents am arrogant for not being sensitive to that lady by saying that am dissatisfied. That mom has to see her everyday as she walks past the shop so now if that lady had reimbursed the money it will  be shameful to them. We had a whole fight. And now here we are.

114,"Hi there. I'm currently looking into attending meetings that support children with alcoholic parents and am confident that it will help a lot but I'm very nervous that it will not work out the way that I hope. 

My mom was sober for about 8 years and fell off of that sobriety about a year ago. At 1st it was very light and not really noticeable that she was picking up drinking again because it was acceptable as social. That fast forward to now and she's drinking from noon on a Sunday and missing family events like wakes and funerals and Thanksgiving...

Back when my mom 1st got badd with alcohol I was a teenager and of course went about a dressing it with her in all the wrong ways.  Angrily accusing her, getting into fights with her, making her feel like a horrible human being because of her problem, and refusing to be around her when she probably needed me most. Now that I'm no longer 17 and dealing with this issue and now 29,  I am trying to do all the research I currently can before I try to help her in the best way possible.

I'm currently looking into different groups that support children with alcoholic parents but not sure what to expect when I go. I'm also wondering if there is anything anybody can recommend here that would be helpful for me to do for my mother. Also pretty unfortunate, I'm doing this now instead of later because I do have my own wedding coming up in November next year and nervous if I don't help address this now that she may not be OK by the time of my wedding. I know it is also unfair to think that I can a dress and fix something like alcoholism in less than a year for somebody who has it pretty severely; I don't mean to be little how severe alcoholism can be. But I wanted to address this now rather than later should she need rehab and unfortunately miss my wedding...  I know she would never forgive herself for that.

Am I being selfish in trying right now due to that personal time crunch? Or am I doing the right thing regardless because I'm trying to assess it before it gets any worse? 

 I feel like I'm both being selfish and doing the right thing at the same time and could really use some encouragement.",09Dec2019,1

TW: self harm, eating disorder mention, depression.


So for some context, I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder and have been dealing with it since I was about 11. I used to self harm in a variety of ways including cutting, food restriction, binging etc. I was never formally diagnosed with an eating disorder but I definitely had an issue with food for a long time.

I am now 21 (22 soon) and my life has generally took an up turn. I have considered myself selfharm free (with minor slip ups) for about 5 years now but it just isn't true, I've just found different ways. (Refusing help/not asking for it, food restriction is still an issue, beating myself up for stupid things, putting myself in bad situations etc) Through my depression I've also developed a quite severe anxiety and I literally am unable to do basic things like making dinner when my roommates are in the living room. 

I feel as though my depression has turned from an extreme self hatred into what people typically think of when they hear about depression. Every once in awhile I'll have really good days in which I end up cleaning EVERYTHING, doing all the laundry that's piled up, doing dishes, vacuuming. But typically I just let all this stuff pile up, not because I want to but because I either can't be bothered or I'm too nervous to bring my dishes to the kitchen to wash them, too nervous to leave my room to do laundry, no motivation to get up and leave my bed. When I'm at home I feel quite horrible when I see all of these thing piled up but I just can't be bothered to do any of it. I'm just so tired. It's gotten worse since my 6 day a week schedule started (school) but that's over now so you'd think I'd be fine to do these things but I'm too tired still.

This unmotivated and tiredness also leaks into the things I eat. I've been trying to eat better and make sure I get enough nutrients when I do eat a full meal and I've definitely been better about that but I still typically eat only 1 proper meal a day, and that's if I even bother. and although my body image and self esteem is quite low my eating habits don't really have anything to do with that anymore, as I know I've been gaining weight even with my limited food intake. 

I know I need help, and I know I should probably go back on medication but that's when it comes full circle, because I am too anxious to even think about going to the clinic. I don't have money for a therapist anyways so it's not like that's a valid option for me. 

It doesn't really help, either, when my boyfriend who is full of anxiety doesn't understand how I can be so anxious about stupid stuff. He sometimes Karen's me with the ""just do it, don't be anxious"" bs that does not help one bit, and just makes me feel worse (he's not the only one who does it, also honey if u see this I love u 😘) 

I know all of these issues would just go away if I got help, and I'm going to try because I know I need it.

So anyways, the point of this (besides venting I guess) is that I'm upset that I honestly just realized that my depression is just as bad as it was before, it's just quieter and in a different form.",09Dec2019,1

POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNINGS: self harm, sexual assault, abuse, eating disorder. 

I am a 21 year old female and I feel like I have been through a lot. Maybe it just seems like a lot because I come from a small town where everyone leads seemingly normal lives. I had a rough start. My biological father was abusive and beat my mom and sexually assaulted us kids. On the night he had planned to kill her, my mom was warned by his friend and she fled with 3 babies. I grew up constantly fearing he would come kill my mother and I refused to leave the house until I was around 11 because I felt I needed to protect her. I would have reoccurring nightmares of him harming her. I constantly saw him around town. Money was an issue sometimes and we were always moving around. Another guy came around and I started calling him dad. He did love me at one point. As a child my anxiety was so bad I would go outside and bang my head in to the concrete. I remember first wanting to kill myself at 10. My mom recognized this and I got help, but the anxiety continued to fester and I began self harming at 13 and developed a severe eating disorder. I remember this was the first time I had ever seen my dad cry. I went in to several treatments and constantly relapsed. At 15 I met my first love and everything changed. I discovered I was worthy of love and I began to love myself. It was the best 9 months. And then I watched him die of cancer. I watched his last moments. I did not know how to cope and all my friends vanished, so I made new ones by partying excessively at 16. I became dependent on alcohol and this began a trend of abusive relationships. I was sexually assaulted by someone I thought was my friend. While assaulting me he told me I deserved to have my boyfriend die. I told myself this over and over and tried attempting to kill myself. I went inpatient twice that summer. I continuously was falling in to toxic relationships that consisted of: forceful sex, emotional manipulation, and public humiliation. When I finally got out of the last one, I swore to never date again. My school held me accountable to my absences and I had no choice but to drop out. At 17 my dad left because he didn’t want to work and we lost the most stable home I had. I lost my best friend, my dog and I had to live at a friend’s, away for my mom for the first time ever. He chose to leave. I tried staying in contact with him and then I eventually stopped to see if he would make the effort. He didn’t. I attempted suicide again. Things started to come together when I got my GED began working full time as an assistant pre-school teacher. I love children and this job gave me purpose. At 19 I got an apartment with some friends. Things were good until I met up with an old friend. I fell asleep on his couch and I woke up to him raping me. I decided I wouldn’t let it affect me and never sought out help. I continued about life. A kid from high school messaged me and told me he had always liked me and asked me on a date. For some reason I felt compelled to say yes despite being happily single for 2 years. I am happy I did. We are still together after 9 months and he has become my best friend. I realized my most recent assault was keeping me from trusting him. I opened up and he urged me to seek help regarding my most recent sexual assault. I did. I finally decided to take the chance and apply to college. I got accepted and am finishing up my freshman year studying social work. I am in a healthy relationship for the first time in 5 years. I haven’t self harmed in 2 years. No disordered eating in 2+ years. I am actively in therapy and facing my traumas and losses.

I can not articulate the feelings of complete hopelessness I felt for so long. This is not a pity party and I know people have it worse, but damn I’m proud of myself.

In short, I am happy I stuck around. Life is surprising me in the best ways. For most of my life, I wanted to stop existing. I am happy that the world wanted me to stay. 

I am thankful for my mother, siblings, and boyfriend for being the best friends I could ever ask for.",09Dec2019,1

She almost killed me when I was two or three with pills. She snorted my medication around the same time. I had never loved her. Luckily, my grandmother saved me. She helped me with everything. I love my grandmother and I know that she loves me just as much. I'm super depressed with social anxiety and paranoia. It is because of my mother that I cannot handle the sadness that she has caused me. At least I have my grandmother to take care of me. I am a smart kid, but I can't reasonably handle the troubles that my mother has caused.",09Dec2019,1
122,"One of my jobs is doing estimates for a home improvement company, I spend a lot of time driving around to different jobs and doing estimates. Today I got to one job and realized I was missing a couple things. I sighed and managed to complete it with the tools I had left. Contemplated whether to go back and look, but I knew they were on the back of the car when I drove off, and could easily have been run over since. No great monetary value, probably less than $30, but one would be slightly inconvenient to replace, (shipping time) so I decided to go back and look anyway.

A couple of blocks before I got to the job, I saw them both laying in the grass at the base of a stop sign. Must’ve driven that far before they fell off, and someone must’ve seen them and put them there in case whoever it was came back.

126,"Have you ever seen a God or felt it's whisper?

Have you seen beyond our realm and into what's theirs?

Matters in this life that people would think the Gods would tend to go unspoken about and in turn nothing changes here on our little planet, nothing at all. The gods work in mysterious ways as the popular saying goes and a priority might be high but that doesn't mean it gets tendered to.

I once said to myself if I met a God I would charge at him and swing whilst screaming ' children, starving and dying ' but that's just not how Gods work. I'd still do it, but it would not fix anything. I would forfeit my only soul within seconds of dying just to get a message across to them -- and would they even listen or ask why a crazy soul from earth just tried to attack them? It's probably an all time occurrence..

Yes.. Sometimes I toast to the Gods and sometimes they toast to me. There are crazy people on this planet who believe they can commune with the gods, feel their presence and hear their whispers, speak to the dead and see the future. If it's true, it's an incredibly small amount of people. Incredibly small.

I remember meeting a man who told me he was a shaman. There are no such things in the real world. But I have seen beyond this realm, it was not as clear as this world as you might expect and quite hard to recall but, it was not a nice place and the Gods were also, not nice.",09Dec2019,1

We met by happenstance right here on this very website. We discovered we had so many similarities and have dealt with the same type of struggle for most of our lives. I found myself growing to like you more and more each day. It wasn't always the best of times with us though, sometimes I would hastily comment on your demeanor of certain situations. I didn't like some of the ways you came off in our conversations. I would tell you to try a different approach and you would be enraged. I admit I wasn't pleasant about it and could have handled it better. But I realized I was wrong and I apologized for everything that could have caused distance between us. You were the only person I told I loved willingly. At first I was awkard about it and didn't want to say it, just put an heart emojji. But then as time went on I said it because I truly felt the love from you. You said you would be there for me. During my birthday, the holidays and more. You said you'd never leave me. I agreed to the same. This last time we had a spat I truly told you what I felt from the heart. It wasn't my intention to hurt you. But again I came from a place of anger instead of love. I have a tendency to do that at times. I don't know how to get this out of my heart so I'm writing it here because you won't talk to me anymore. I tried to apologize to you so many times. But now as the days go by I realize that this is irreconcilable. You broke your promise and I was too quick to let you go. But I will always remember the times we shared. Even if it doesn't matter to you it truly mattered to me. I never have cried over a friend in my life until now. Maybe it's becsuse I realize I messed up, maybe it's becsuse I know there's no going back. But I have to let you go. I thank you for talking to me about the precious things in life and not being afraid to show me love. Something I truly needed.
