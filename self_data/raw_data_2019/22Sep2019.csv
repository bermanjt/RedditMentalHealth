0,"When it comes to women, I don't know where I stand. I'm basically (according to people) an attractive, nice (straight) guy who does not use women for sex, is easy to talk to and has a likable personality. As a result, I attract a lot of women, but as a result of *that* I also make a lot of girls jealous and mad at me. Probably because the way I come off seems to give people the impression that I'm ""clicking"" with them or leading them on into something more. So when they find out I'm talking to other girls, they get jealous and mad.

And honestly? I feel terrible for doing this. I don't mean to hurt anybody. I just try to bring the best vibes possible to the table and make everyone happy. I don't really know what to do or think of this. I'm not ashamed of who I am or anything and I'd hate to have to change. But if I'm just hurting people over and over again, there's a problem. I don't know what to do.

Am I being an unintentional asshole?",22Sep2019,1

2,"I‚Äôm not the most social person in the world. I don‚Äôt know how I have friends because I‚Äôm the worst at talking to others and meeting new people. I guess through having being forced into groups for class assignments and through random people who are actually social and decided to talk to me.
Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm the worst friend ever. Like I‚Äôm not doing enough. Especially when my friends are crying, going through something, having a hard time. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. And I just feel like I‚Äôm useless. I‚Äôll go home thinking about what I could of done or what I should of done. What I did do. How I could of helped. Why I didn‚Äôt. And I feel like they probably think I‚Äôm dull and not a great person. 
Especially when they plan for hanging out or birthdays. Sometime I even ignore their messages in case they want to persuade me to see them. I usually make up an excuse because I just don‚Äôt like leaving my room. And feel like they hate me. Even though they do talk to me and they make me happy. They are great people. When something happens to me they‚Äôre there for me to make me laugh, make me feel better. But when it‚Äôs reversed I have no idea what to do. And that makes me feel worthless.",22Sep2019,3
3,"I hate myself. There is no question about that. I'm not very good at being a functional person in today's world. I'm riddled with crippling depression and anxiety that beats me down to nothing. There's nobody home in me, just an essence of who I wish I was. It's not even like I have a terrible life either. No, I'm rich. Not money rich but, i have a good close family; a strong support system. I have an amazing signigicant other that cares for me deeply. I have dog, who's my besfriend. I have an amazing job, a dream job. I never thought I'd be doing what I am, in a pretty high position yet to boot. 

That's not the real me though. Most days, if I had the choice, I'd sit on the couch and do nothing all day. I have done that, I've watched myself fade away until I had nothing in my bank account and nothing good to say about it. I'm always lying and making up excuses to get out of things I need to do, or I'll just ignore it all together and pretend it doesn't need done, or that I had no clue about it. I've ghosted on jobs, couldn't hold one to save my life. I'm only in it for me, and my ultimate goal is to sit on my ass and do nothing for eternity. I don't go out or have friends or meaningful relationships with anyone. Except my SO, god bless him, he's a saint. I've grown to resent my family. How can they be so happy and productive and successful in life while im here struggling to get through my day. How do people do it?? How do they autopilot through life in the pursuit of money and meaningful relationships? I don't want any of that, or any of this. I hate when people acknowledge my existance, because once they do they'll have something to judge. It makes me angry when they acknowledge me, i can't stand when things are asked of me. I know what needs done, but am I going to do it? Of course not. Why would I do anything if I can just sit on the couch and let my thoughts eat me away. 

I live inside my head. Living in there has proven to me that there is a hell, and it lives inside of me. It's never been a good place to be. Full of criticism and bad memories. One big negative mass festering inside of my skull. I wish I could just end it. Death sounds peaceful. And eternity of nothing; nobody bothing me; no obligations. Just sweet silence away from my screaming thoughts. 

I hate myself and if I had the balls I'd be dead.",22Sep2019,2

8,"I‚Äôm 18M and have just started university for accounting, the only thing I did well in in hs, after a gap year of working. I am not enjoying uni so far, as the work is tedious and mostly online, and I suck with computers: it‚Äôs like they all conspire against me. Also there‚Äôs lots of group work and I know virtually nobody at my uni, and have always had a very tough time making friends and socializing. I have already messed up a few assignments. 

Furthermore, I can count the number of friends I have on one hand, and don‚Äôt have someone who is a best friend, someone who I can trust, not even my brother. I live with my family but we are not really close, this is the result of both our doings. I previously tried to trust my father with some information about when I was struggling with mental health for a little bit in hs and thought my mom didn‚Äôt take it seriously. Now I am almost certain he told my mom and I dont tell them anything, because I think they won‚Äôt care, and will just be mad, because that is what has happened in the past. 

I have watched those reddit videos on YouTube, and one that really caught my attention was the one on symptoms of depression. I quickly realized that I suffered from almost every single one mentioned in the video: not wanting to get out of bed, pretending everything is fine, even my interests are fading, no motivation for anything, etc. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even do things that would make me happy anymore.

I took a gap year because I had a rough time in hs and didn‚Äôt feel ready for university, and now I feel even worse because I‚Äôm having such a hard time concentrating on anything and convincing myself this is what I have to do. I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to so I‚Äôm trying here. I feel my options are: try to get my parents to understand that I can‚Äôt do school anymore, try my hardest to overcome what has destroyed me my entire life, or just let myself go.

I do feel I‚Äôm getting better as the level of anxiety it gives me has decreased substantially but I just can‚Äôt get the worry out of my head. Anybody else have this irrational source of anxiety?

14,"There is a certain topic that I have very strong opinions about but can't ever take a side on, and I can't avoid it because of how stuff related to it is everywhere in my life and I end up feeling bad and remembering the horrible shit I saw many years ago. I always spend a stupid amount of time arguing with myself and then never form an opinion because I literally can't.

If one side argues using logic, the other side will make me remember all those scenes of people folded up in directions that obviously require broken bones, people missing all kinds of body parts, people dangling off sharp objects, people with their insides on the outside, etc. and I start feeling bad about trying to brush over all of that using logic. The argument becomes ""all those people never did get justice, the entire world literally didn't care, so the least you can do is not ignore the issue.""

It seems too coldhearted and inhuman to take the logical side and just move on, but I can't take the angry side either because the things I have already done would make me a traitor with the worst case of dramatic irony. According to online polls, somehow 2/3 of the people affected have chosen to move on, and they must have seen far worse shit than I have because I left early, so I don't understand why they don't get intrusive thoughts of the things they saw.

18,"At dinner, my dad commented on the clothes I was wearing. I replied saying that I was at home and I would change when I went out. My dad shouted that I change, I said I wasn't that hungry and I left the table.  When I was at the hallway, my dad demanded that I give my phone to him. I was so fed up with all his demanding, so I talked back and said NO. He then walked up to me and tried to yank my phone out of my hand. I was expecting this so I gripped on to my phone hard. Obviously, since he was stronger then me and was using two hands, he managed to grab my phone from my hand and smashed against the wall so hard that it took out part of the wall. My phone cracked, and the bottom portion of it detached from the rest of the phone. He yelled at me saying he was never going to buy me a phone again and told me to go to my room. I was determine to stand my ground and said no again. He was further angered and pushed me to the ground and I finally ran to my room. You might be wondering, where was mom in all of this. She was sitting at the dinner table doing nothing. When my dad smashed my phone, she got mad at him for the broken wall. THE GOD DAMN WALL. I was sobbing, in tears and did she make any notion of sympathy. NO. This isn't even the first time this happened. When I was eight, I my dad was saying I was being annoying, and I replied ""whatever"" he slapped my face. I was EIGHT. The physical treatment ended up stopping as I got older, and since I was a ""girl"". Around a year ago, a similar incident occurred. I was being ""rude"" and I disagreed on whatever he was saying, and again he yanked my phone out of my hand. Took the sim-card out of my phone and broke it in half. He had the nerve to throw the pieces at me. I admit for these incidents I was ""talking back"", but the worst thing I said was""No"" and ""Why should I"". I don't want to sound bratty, but I'm the kid that all there parents wants there kids to be. I have straight As, don't do drugs, I don't cuss at my parents, I don't call them by there first name, I try to be polite. But no, my parents can't fucking accept me for not being perfect for one fucking second. I'm sorry that I can't tolerate you trash talking about me, right in front of me all the time. I'm sorry that me not agreeing with you on everything makes you angry, I'm sorry that I CRY, when you insult and hurt me.

My fiance just started night shifts and he works until 6 AM. He is always tired and I do go over to his parents' house to see him often (we're working on moving out together), but it usually just means hanging out in his room and playing on my PC while he sleeps if I'm not snuggling him. This way I can do my own thing but still be around him and for us right now, that counts as hanging out. 

However, I've been getting tired of not being able to spend waking hours with him. I feel like I hardly ever get to see him anymore, and I don't mean literally, I mean, be able to talk to him and hang out with him, when he's not asleep or playing his own game. Sometimes he does come over, wake me up at 7 am, and snuggle with me before I go to school later in the morning, but it usually means he lays there watching TV on his phone while I either sleep or watch my own thing. I want to be able to talk to him or play games with him, or go out to eat with him, or watch TV together which we haven't done in a while. It feels like I'm missing out on quality time with him and it hurts. 

I guess I should say that my hormones are a little out of whack right now because it's my T.O.M. but I don't think that discounts any of my feelings regardless. I've been upset/sad all day.

31,"So I (23F) have been visiting this therapist for about five sessions now. I have a past history of depression and anxiety but now I'm tackling some remaining annoying anxiety, trauma related issues, and PTSD like related symptoms. Though I feel really good, I realized I have some remaining issues related to the trauma and I want to better manage my anxiety. Main reason I went to therapy again is because I realized the trauma related issues is above my lovely bf's pay grade.


The last two sessions of this therapist have left me pissed off. Three weeks ago I had a session that mainly focused on my anxiety/confidence related to work. I overthink things and think I will fail when evedice is on the contrary. In this session my therapist noted I tend to smile and laugh a lot. Agreed. Overall I would say my personality is bubbly af. Even in really bad depressive episodes I can still smile and genuinely have a good time. And I will admit, sometimes it is a coping mechanism if I wish not show ""true emotions"" at a given moment (such as I'm at work). I know not the smartest thing but I'm better at recognizing what I'm feeling in a given moment. My therapist made the comment that my smiley and laughing personality is always a coping mechanism and I'm not really showing my true self. I retorted that no this is really how I am as a default most of the time. It is me. If I wasnt like this for a day, coworkers/family/bf would be concerned about me. He again said that I need to work on showing my true emotions and not always relying on the coping mechanism.

 As I left I wasn't feeling the best about the session. However as the night went on I got pissed as hell. How the hell does he have a right to say me being bubbly isnt showing my true self?  I know in therapy you're supposed to be challenged but God damn it's my personality. Later talked to my bf about it and he said it was odd. 

This week I went to my next session. I decided to bring up how I found my birth father online and I wish to communicate with him but unsure if it's the right thing since birth father only met me twice when I was a baby. One thing that stood out is that he referred to my birth father as father and my dad (technically step dad) as dad. Now dad being dad is fine but I really have an issue with my birth father being referred to as anything else. I corrected him twice and he kept referring to birth father as father. Really pissed me off. Then at the end he said the best way to forgive my birth father is to recognize and acknowledge that at the very most, he gave me his love. His love being the gift of life. Oh boy that lit an angry fire in me. I dont see my birth father giving me his ""love"", he was never there for me. Hell my consummation was probably just horny teenagers, not two love birds making love. At the same time I dont feel like I need to ""forgive"" my birth father. I've accepted hes never wanted to be with me for what ever reason. It seems to have worked for the best. Yes I have some feeling of worthlessness due to the rejection from my birth father, but I dont feel like forgiving him will be helpful. I just need to worth on the worthlessness. I think my therapist noticed my tense mood and ask how I felt about recognizing my birth fathers love. I told him straight up (unlike me) I think its bull shit. Therapist said in time I will realize that and be on a better journey of forgiveness if I accepted that birth father gave me his love. K left feeling like I wasted my money.


I talked to my friend who has a degree in psychology and will be going to get her masters to become a mental health counselor. I talked about my last two sessions and she says it sounds very odd. As if hes projecting his own opinions to the subject regarding my birth father. She said too not referring to him as I refer to him was a red flag. Especially since my therapist before made a note of that after he made that mistake twice. 


In talking with my friend who does have the background in this sort of thing helped. I still feel very confused and feeling like I'm just fully committed to the treatment plan. Tbh im not sure what my treatment plan is. I feel as if I'm wasting my money. I dont feel better after going to these two sessions. I feel pissed. 

Idk man, I just want to work on these last little mental health things and I dont think I able to right now. How the fuck do I even quit a therapist? Last time I finished therapy we finished my treatment plan; it was a natural end. Bittersweet but nice. 

Thank you anyone who read this mumbo jumbo. I'm upset and mad and not sure if I'm just quitting too early before I see treatment working or if its actually just not helpful.",22Sep2019,2

33,"This girl was my best friend through high school, we were together all the time, had sleepovers all weekends, I was even invited to a few family gatherings and vacations.

We graduated and she started to slowly distance herself, later I found that she had a new boyfriend after I went with her to buy a pregnancy test, apparently they‚Äôve been together for like 2 months.

Maybe like a month later I got a text from her, she was getting married and wanted me as her bridesmaid. They ended up just getting married by law and I was a witness. After that she completely stopped talking to me.

After a while, I don‚Äôt even remember how long, she texted me asking to hang out, we did and talked about how things were going. She told me that they fight a lot and don‚Äôt let each other hang out with friends because of jealousy, she was also having fertility issues and problems with money AND they were living with her parents. After that time she kept on ghosting me like nothing had happened.

Last month I got a notification on Facebook of her husband wanting to be friends with me, she also followed me on Instagram and contacted me again, apparently she was pregnant and would give birth at any moment in the next few weeks, I congratulated her and told her to let me know when the baby arrived, and you guessed it, she never talked to me again except for viewing all my Instagram stories and liking  my posts.


I feel sad and guilty, I didn‚Äôt liked her husband from the beginning, she first introduced him to me at the ‚Äúwedding‚Äù and he never made the effort to talk or even look at me, his wife‚Äôs best friend, I felt a weird vibe about him but I didn‚Äôt said anything to her because I felt like it was too late, they were literally about to get married and she was happy.

When she told me about his jealousy issues I didn‚Äôt told her that I didn‚Äôt think it was normal, on a marriage there shouldn‚Äôt be jealousy anymore but I didn‚Äôt.

And now even with the baby I see the arguing on Facebook about him seeing some pictures of girls or whatever and just publicly fighting on social media, I feel like I should‚Äôve said something about it but I knew she would be mad at me and take his side (which she did anyway), I knew I should‚Äôve said something but now that‚Äôs her baby daddy and it‚Äôs way too late.

37,"I used to work with a girl by the name of Stephanie (if I recall correctly). She had immigrated from Mexico to California, and from there to my local state because of her husband.

We worked together in a pretty terrible factory setting job, one that caused me a lot of existential crisis. But she always kept a positive outlook on life though, somehow. We were teamed up together in a very particular kind of job in a factory setting, where we always worked together and only together.

There were days where I kept thinking I was going to quit, this job wasn't worth it, I couldn't handle it even one more day.

And tonight, a song came on in my YouTube list that reminded me of her after all these years, several years later. A Bob Marley song.

Whenever I was having a bad day I'd talk to her about it, because I didn't have anyone else around at the time. And she'd quote this song lyric - *""don't worry, be happy.""* That was it. She would express some sympathy, and then she would say this one statement, sometimes substituted with ""don't worry about a thing, cuz every little thing is gonna be alright.""

Every. Time. And somehow, it made my day better. She always seemed to make my day better, just by saying that one phrase. I knew who Bob Marley was, but never heard his lyrics so spoken outright like that.

Life has been hard for me lately, but remembering that past action, *you*, had somehow lifted the weight of my life right now. 

If you're out there and could possibly be reading this, girl, you were watching out for me more than you realize. I miss your sunshine.

Anyways after a few months of being close I kind of started to realize we weren‚Äôt clicking.

Ive also never done anything to my friend that could make them dislike me, as I‚Äôve never gotten her into trouble or been mean to her or borrowed money from her or anything like that. We literally just would talk about what we were up to and like music and our lives. I think they were just emotionally abusing her and trying to make her think that her friends didn‚Äôt care about her and weren‚Äôt her friends or something, but idk I have no idea what the reason is, I can‚Äôt really think of anything that would make sense even if it didn‚Äôt involve me.

We were still texting and good friends but things would always come up when we would go to hang out which didn‚Äôt bother me bc I mean there‚Äôs plenty of time to reschedule things and she was busy and I was just living life. But we were talking a little less and once I forgot to text her back (which was a normal thing we both did sometimes) and for whatever reason we didn‚Äôt talk for like a month. But I thought we were both just busy and would pick up where we left off the next time we spoke. Or maybe we would just became less close of friends, it‚Äôs not like we couldn‚Äôt still talk or hang out. She didn‚Äôt reach out to me, and I didn‚Äôt reach out to her, but she was the one with the problem so I figured if she wanted to talk or felt like I was distant or if she thought I was mad at her or something that she would let me know. I snapchatted  her one day soon after that gap and she didn‚Äôt reply so one night when I was kind of hormonal and emo I texted and was like ‚Äúhey is everything alright? Did I do something to upset you?‚Äù I don‚Äôt remember what else I said but I think that was basically it. She didn‚Äôt respond, ever! Also I haven‚Äôt checked but I‚Äôm thinking she unfollowed me on all social media as well. 

I have no idea what I did to her? I think this is immature and kind of psycho. I was fine not really talking to her, but I do not like being on bad terms with people.. if I had known that me not talking to her (if that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs even mad about) upset her I simply would‚Äôve talked to her more!! All I needed was some communication but I didn‚Äôt realize it was a big deal! I‚Äôm starting to hate girls because so many act like this.

54,"I posted this before in other subreddits, but I want to share it here as well. This is the only thing that's on my mind and I feel like such an asshole. I can't forgive myself.

I had an ex with borderline personality disorder. Our relationship was very bad. She was manipulative, blamed me for everything and we had fights all the time. She was afraid I would leave her/cheat on her if I didn't get enough sex from her and sometimes was angry at me because ""I would definitely cheat on her in the future"". Despite all this we also had our good moments and I (at the moment thought, at least, that I) loved her.

One night we had another fight about this. When the fight calmed down, she asked me if I wanted sex. She still looked very bummed out and sad about the fight, so I figure she was not sincere and told her that I only want sex if she also wants to have sex and that I don't want her to initiate sex when she does not want to. She tells me she wants too. I ask her a few more times if she was sure, because of didn't look like she was. Although unenthusiastically, she kept insisting that she was sure. I wanted too, so we start. The sex was really bad: she was passive and unenthusiastic. I figured she was still sad/angry about the fight or that she just wanted to please me, but she did consent and it was her own choice and she is responsible of her choices. So I let her know that if she does not want sex, she has to tell me. We proceed, I finish and when I gesture to finish her as well she tells me no, so we go to sleep. The next day she got angry at me for proceeding and told me about her past trauma again. At the time I felt angry since I felt that she lied to me when she consented. Later that day she forgave me and I didn't think much of it after that. We broke up the day after that, since all the fights, blaming, manipulation that happened in the relationship got way to much for me, and now also the incident of 2 days before happened.

Now, 2 years later, looking back at it after all the #metoo debate and discussion about enthusiastic consent, I feel very guilty about this. About one month ago it hit me. She might have been wrong by not being honest, but I was definitely wrong as well. I should have taken her passive behaviour during the sex as a sign to stop. At the time I thought that her wanting to please me was her own choice so that it was okay. Of course, this thought is true, but I should have taken her irrational fear of me otherwise leaving her in consideration and make the moral choice based on that. Since I realized this all last month, this keeps me up at night. I definitely learned from this. But I still can't forgive myself.",22Sep2019,27

56,"I graduated from high school this past June. I went to a boarding school in Maine but I am originally from the Czech  Republic. I am very academically oriented. Throughout high school I got pretty good grades, I took college classes, and I received 5s on pretty much all my AP tests except one. I had two options ahead of me at the time. Either I get my pharmD at a school in Boston or, if pass an entrance exam to a medical school in Czechia, I attend said medical school. For me to successfully pass the exam, I had to teach myself organic chemistry which sadly was not a part of the AP Chemistry curriculum at my school. Or at least we did not go in depth at all. Because of that I thought I will fail the exam and I will have to attend the pharmacy school in Boston. Which I did not mind because I had a girlfriend there.

However, my girlfriend broke up with me at the beginning of July and I have realized I want to stay home close to my family. I also always dreamt of becoming a doctor rather than a pharmacist. So I decided to give it my all. I achieved the impossible to me, and I learned everything I had to know for the entrance exam that I took at the end of July. I was heartbroken so I studied whenever I had free time to get my mind off the breakup. It worked. I got into the medical school and I got over my ex. 

I started the medical school a week ago. I am the youngest in my class and so far I am really good at anatomy and everyone wants me to help them. I feel like I should be happy. I am on path of becoming a doctor which is what I have always wanted. I am starting to develop a relationship with a girl and I am making tons of new friends. Yet I feel empty. 

I wanted to write this post since I received the good news about my acceptance, and I wanted it to be a happy post. But I did not really feel happy yet. I have always battled with depression and I thought that not having to stress if I am really going to be accepted to a medical school will solve things. Or that me being back home and close to my parents will solve things. But nothing is changing about my mental state. I feel like my existence is pointless. My parents still think of me as a dumb child and my dad did not even think that medical school is challenging until I showed him everything we need to learn. They do not believe in me and they want me to be someone else. I am never enough for them. He still wants me to learn a dozen more languages because knowing languages is the equivalent of success for him but he does not understand that medical school is the equivalent success for me. 

But enough whining about my parents. I also wanted to point out how I am starting to realize how toxic our society is becoming. We are merely a dust in the air for powerful politicians and super rich people who rule the world. We have goals we want to achieve and once we achieve them we get lost because what else is there for us. My goal was to get into a medical school which I achieved but what next? Become a doctor and just spend my life being a doctor yeah I know that but will that make me happy? I don't know. I read some of the Unabomber's manifesto and the more I think about it the more I like it. I wish humans never developed such an advanced society and stayed simple. I want to live far away grow some potatoes and hunt for meat and just that kind of lifestyle because I feel like the simplicity of it would take a lot of burden off my shoulders. By that I dont mean that fighting for survival is simple, rather that achieving my goal daily, surviving, will actually make me happy.

Now I will stop rambling. I just wanted to say that I do not think our society is healthy and even though I achieved everything I wanted I am still not happy.",22Sep2019,1

59,"First, I want to make clear that we never got to be officially together, but we were both in love with each other. This is going to be a long post, sorry.

I‚Äôll first explain how our relationship grew and then how it came crashing down:

We went to the same school together, but we never really interacted that much. We usually saw each other at parties and stuff, but were never really close. 

University started and I entered med school to become a doctor. Turns out, she was entering MedTech in the same med school I was going to attend. Things happened, and in a matter of months we both had basically lost the entire group of friends we had both gained after entering uni. So we began hanging out together, and what started as an alliance to survive the hellish world of med school, turned into a friendship. 

We started to realize we had a lot in common, and It was the first time I could feel so natural around someone else. I‚Äôm an introvert, I usually feel the pressure to ‚Äúkeep entertained‚Äù the other person, but with her, everything just flowed. She told me she felt the same way.

Months went by, we spent a lot of time together, but something was about to change. My friend told me that, for various reasons, she was going to leave the country to study abroad. I went with a group of friends to say goodbye to her in the airport, and so she left.

That‚Äôs were I kind of broke down, I realized that moment how attached I had grown to her, she had become a part of my daily life, and even though I met a lot of new friends, no one could really replace her. We kept in contact though, we basically talked every day for the following months.

Then, one day I found out she was thinking of coming back. She was feeling homesick, she didn‚Äôt like the culture of were she went, she was most certainly depressed at that point. It hurt me so much realizing the pain she was going through. In the end she came back, and I swear I hadn‚Äôt been that happy in such a long time. I had really missed her. I promised myself that I would never lose her again like that, I just wanted to be by her side.

She entered a business career in here, and we began hanging out a lot more. I had a blast with her, we spent s lot of time together and I enjoyed every minute of it. We talked about everything, we messed with each other, we went out to eat, see movies, we went to expositions. We didn‚Äôt realize it at first, but we sort of started dating.

But, being idiotic introverts as we were, none of us really accepted the feeling we had developed one for another. 

And then it all came down:

To put it short, we spent too much time together without defining what we were, friends? A couple? Even though all our friends saw that we were clearly into each other. And she began to grow tired of it. She is really introverted, she is the type of person that tires herself out after hanging out for too long with someone, even if she enjoys being with that person.

And when we hanged out, we did it for about 6 hours every week. She began to grow exhausted of it, but she didn‚Äôt realize it/have the bravery to say it at the moment. She also admits that she has the horrible habit of, instead of facing people, ghosting them until they are out of her life.

So one day we went from chatting almost every day to being in a state of radio-silence. And, since she didn‚Äôt even explain what was going on (Something that she ended up regretting later), I naturally got worried because one of the most important persons in my life just sort of disappeared.

She thought that after a week or to I would be just sort of give up on trying to contact her, but I didn‚Äôt. Then, we both saw each other for the first time in a month in a friend‚Äôs party, I tried to say hi to her but she kept being evasive and then left.

I got home and I texted her asking what was going on, and she said that she had really liked me at one point, but since we were in nowhere-land she was disappointed and wanted time for herself. I called her and we talked (cried) a whole lot.

In summary, we both still cared a lot about each other a lot. She had also missed me a lot when she left the country. We never wanted to lose each other. She felt awful for trying to ghost me, she said she was trying to run away but it just ended up hurting both of us. We decided to meet up the next day and talk things out.

She felt sorry for the last month, and we both recognized that we were both at fault for it. We came to the agreement that we would still see each other, but that we would give each other more time and space. We also promised each other to be honest, so that what happened last month wouldn‚Äôt repeat.

She also told me she wasn‚Äôt interested in having a relationship with anyone for the moment anymore. When the year was staring, she was fine, but now she was going through many family-university related issues and she wasn‚Äôt ready to commit to anything until they were fixed. She also admitted that she was awful and cold in everything love-related, and she had always been. 

I told her that that was fine, but I still loved her, and that what I felt for her wasn‚Äôt going to change in the neartime future at all.

We came to an agreement: We would keep seeing each other, but less frequently/for less time to give more time and space for our introverted selves. We were going to be friends, she was going to accept my feelings for her, but wasn‚Äôt going to reciprocate them.

She also promised to not close-up to the idea of having a relationship, but for the moment we both had other priorities that we wanted to sort out, and that if we both started to feel something for each other again, this time we would be honest with each other. She also asked me to promise her to not expect anything from her, since she admits that she is useless in everything that is love related and believes that she will die alone seeing how things were going. After she told me that, I told her not to close up to other people because it wasn‚Äôt healthy for her. I also asked her to open up more about her problems with the people that loved her, so that they didn‚Äôt accumulate until they collapsed her (Like how it just happened), and she agreed to it. She said she said she was feeling way better now, and was really sad for having cast me aside. She blamed herself for alienating herself from other people when hard things in life happened. She said she was glad we were friends.

But I am not, I mean, right now i wouldn‚Äôt want a relationship at all. She made me promise not to expect anything from her. But in the end I do want us to try again, hopefully when summer arrives, being more mature and honest with each other after all of this.

I can‚Äôt help but think that, before things go toxic between us, there was something really beautiful growing. And I don‚Äôt want it to die. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right. That‚Äôs why I want to wait until she‚Äôs ready again, if she ever is. I know myself deep down, and when I love someone like this I just can‚Äôt bury how I feel. I know this is a weight that will be with me for the next couple of years.

In the end I‚Äôm conflicted because I know she is complicated, she is volatile in love, but I just want to be by her side and support her, but not as a friend anymore. In the end, all I hope for is that she gives me another chance so I can love her and care for her in a more honest, healthy and mature way.

But I get the feeling that she won‚Äôt be ready to let anyone in her life in the next couple of years, or even more. 

But in the end, I still just love her like the moment she came back to my country and I hugged her after not seeing her for such a long time.

I‚Äôm also scared that the time-meeting limitations will affect how I approach to her. I used to basically just walk in say hi talk about everything and ask her out, in a fluid and natural way. Now I feel like I could just be bothering her without realizing if I do that, it almost feels like I‚Äôm walking in a mine field.

Maybe I had too many expectations of her, I just want to have a simple friendship that evolves into a simple and loving relationship were we are honest to each other.",22Sep2019,1
60,"I'm his best friend and also a friend of hers. He is very scared of compromise and yesterday he did something mind numbingly stupid to her, so this morning I gave him a stern talking to about why he is sabotaging their not-relationship and how he should make things right because she is worth it.

He hasn't had a proper relationship since we divorced four years ago and until now I didn't care much that he ran away as soon as things started to get serious, because the girls involved were not a great fit, but this girl is really cool. I really think if he fucks this up he is going to regret it.

So today after work he is going to her place with chocolate that I growled at him to bring as an apology and to have a sincere talk about feelings and his fear of compromise, and see if they can figure it out and maybe put a label on it.

I really hope this works out! He is my best friend, she is awesome and I think they would both be happier officially together than this no-label thing they have been trying and that I think she is not happy about.

62,"I recently moved in with a friend I admitedly didn't know (or like) very well and her sister. Its not that I just didn't like her, it's just she and I have very different tastes in comedy. And it doesn't help that when she finds something funny, she WILL show you and EXPECTS laughter from you too. If you just chuckle a little (bc it wasn't very funny!!) Shell say ""no, do you get it? Its funny bc xyz"" and you have to sit through a long ass explaination of why this thing that wasn't funny, actually is.

Also my first week here, she and her sister got in a very loud fight about My friend was calling her sister fat, and the sister was calling my friend a whore and my friend just  BEAT HER SISTERS ASS, physically. I was in my room the whole time but I heard everything.  Including the quiet sobbing her sister was doing on the kitchen floor. After the fight, my friend texts me ""omg I hope we didn't wake you up! :)"" Bitch! The fuck!

Also they come from a family of people who don't wash their dishes at all. They ""prescrub"" them and put them in the dish washer. And what if you fill the washer and there's more dishes? Don't you wash the remaining dishes? No, stupid! You leave the dirty dishes in the sink and wait for the dw to be done! Not that that ever happens.

For the longest time, I was the ONLY person cleaning the house, so I stopped cleaning it just to see how long it would take my roommates to clean up after their fucking selves. The house gone to hell! been dirty for two weeks! The sister leaves her SHIT in the living room, my friends doesn't wash her fucking dishes! And she still invites our friends over! Like no I don't want them to see this house like this! Didn't your mother LOVE YOU?? why didn't she raise you right?? Or did you just ignore her you fucking nasty idiot. I got home last night really late from a football game  and just caved. It was 1 am and I cleaned for like an hour til it was spotless (did you know they were also raised in a home that doesn't have kitchen towels. Obviously, bc they didn't do dishes, I don't know why I would think otherwise. But what do they wash their counters with? PAPER TOWELS, YES FLIMSY PAPER TOWELS THAT PROBABLY WON'T CLEAN SHIT).  After an hour of cleaning, the sister got home she just plopped her fat ass on the couch and watched TV at 3 am really loudly and I could hear it through my walls, and dude, these are some thick ass walls.

They are also the type of people who don't wash their hands when they come out of the bathroom, I've learned. My friends made me food on numerous occasions and I just forgot about that.  I've also realized that people that don't wash their hands out if the bathroom are people that will bring their cups and stuff to the bathroom. Like I've caught my roommate just drinking her lemonade in the bathroom! Like that's not a place that everyone in this house shits and shit particles aren't just floating around in there! They also like to curl their hair in the bathroom even tho we all have motors in their room. Is when this thick haired bitches start curling their hair, FUCK YOUR SHIT, okay my guy? You thought this was a toilet? NO, it's a hair room, left apparent bc they also leave their curling instruments out on the counter in the bathroom.


and my last gripe is that they are typed of people with multiple alarms bc ""the first one won't wake me up!"" I'm sorry I literally hate those people, especially if they have roommate and thin walls, ESPECIALLY if they're MY roommates. (Holy fuck another one just started, and it's SUNDAY.why is your alarm going off on the weekend!!!!) Why are you setting alarms if they didn't wake you up? And you know that they don't wake you up bc the sleep cycle you're in? If you go to sleep at a different time, you'll be in a different stage of rem sleep by the time your alarm goes off so you'll hear it better. Also it doesn't have to be so loud I can hear it! I promise you, I have this speaker that I've played at the loudest volume and they have never heard it in the living room, I test it out every single time, you can't hear it when my door is closed! So how THE FUCK can I hear your alarm when my door AND your door is closed???? Its that annoying ass apple alarm. I don't even have an apple and that sound has scarred me. 


I have a roommate who also did literally all these things last semester when I lived in a dorm not a house. I loved her but living with her another semester would have made me murder suicide. Someone explain how I got out if the frying pan into the fire. Please. Do I attract dirty lazy people??? Maybe I'm just not meant to live with people bc every single roommate I've ever had has just had tensions with me. My very first roommate was rude, so rude! Like if it's nighttime send sure comes in and I've got the light on bc I'm doing something like studying or whatever, she'd come in, not saying a word to me, and turn the light off. Like ""hi hello, I'm doing something bitch"". She also spat in the bathroom sink and didn't wash it down the sink or off the mirror, like are you a monster????

So yes I need a hug, preferable from a nice clean person who just washed their hands",22Sep2019,2

The perfect example of my friends doing this was last night; a girl we‚Äôre friends with rocked up to the bar we were at absolutely blind drunk, I‚Äôm talking unable to sit up straight. She sat next to me and we were talking normally for a bit, but she quickly started getting more and more noticeably drunk; she kept sitting with her head against the table, leaning her head against my shoulder and closing her eyes, etc. The bouncer had come up a couple of times and I‚Äôd managed to convince him she was okay, but to make sure she wasn‚Äôt kicked out and so that I didn‚Äôt have to keep picking her head up off the table, I just kind of sat her up and put my arm round her shoulder for support so that she was sitting up straight and just sat shooting the shit with her to try keep her awake. I should clarify I‚Äôve known this girl for years, she‚Äôs completely comfortable with me, and this really was just me trying to make sure she didn‚Äôt get kicked out. It even got to the point eventually where I just wanted to go do other shit and enjoy my night and felt kinda stuck making sure she was okay. After a while she sobered up enough to the point she was able to get up and dance, and so I left her to it and kind of kept an eye on her every now and then to make sure she still seemed okay. I actually felt pretty good about myself for being helpful.

Today though my friends keep saying that she must think I‚Äôm a complete creep for sitting with my arm round her, and making it into some weird perverted thing that it‚Äôs not. The thing is while I know in my head I had no creepy intentions and was just trying to look out for a very drunk friend, I can see how that whole situation could actually get misconstrued, and while I know my friends are just saying that shit to get under my skin, I hate the thought of her hearing this kind of thing and re-evaluating that in her head and thinking I was being weird. I actually find myself feeling guilty even though I know I was just trying to help out and I know that my friends want to get to me, but it‚Äôs hard being so self-aware about this kind of thing all the time in your own head and then having people back up your worst thoughts about yourself, especially when those people are supposed to be your friends. At the same time, I really don‚Äôt want to ever creep anyone out, and so I‚Äôm wondering what‚Äôs the best way to deal with all this. I know once people get to know me they see I‚Äôm not a creep, but first impressions mean the world, and I don‚Äôt know how best to get in front of these stupid ‚Äòjokes‚Äô and make people see there‚Äôs nothing wrong with me, especially in cases such as the one above. What‚Äôs the best way I can make sure people don‚Äôt listen to my friends and get potentially creeped out by me?",22Sep2019,2

cw. Unironic suicide ideation

So where do I start. I am an engineering student with a very low GPA of 2.2 (3 semesters completed). I have no chance of getting into a high profile aerospace company like SpaceX (firm 3.5 GPA requirement) or someone similar straight out of college. I have only two options, either I work for a decade at some tiny no-name company or I kill myself and start over. I am leaning towards the second option.

The worst thing is I hoped to be an engineer since I was a young boy with people praising my intelligence and effort with high school being very easy and with a lifelong interest in aerospace with a desire to build rockets and spacecraft. I remember as a teenager launching a model rocket and the pure joy I felt at the time.

\[Notice: when I say firm, I mean that SpaceX (and other comparable companies) will use bots to filter out lower GPAs on fresh graduate applications\]",22Sep2019,0
77,"I bought my first grown-up car in 2014, a 2013 Mazda 2. I had a ton of milestones with that car. I moved out on my own for the first time, got married, got my dog and cat, and bought a house with that car. I was going to drive that thing until it wouldn't run anymore. Well, in April 2018 it was totaled when I was on my way to work. I was stopped at a red light and got rear ended by some guy going 40ish miles an hour. He was drowsy and driving his drunk friends home.

Afterwards, I was pretty upset but thankfully I still got a decent payout. I used it for a downpayment on a 2015 VW Golf TDI. I thought I loved my Mazda, but this car definitely took the cake. It fit my personality and was super fun to drive. Also had more tech features than my Mazda which was fun. I even personalized it with stickers and planned on getting new wheels at some point. Two months ago, I finally settled with the insurance company from my previous accident (I had ongoing injuries for about a year) and used that money to pay off my VW. Now it was paid off and I loved it and was also going to run this car for forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I thought so until I was T-boned in the middle of an intersection 4 days ago. It was a lady that wasn't feeling well and ran a red light. They totaled this car too.

My mother is abusive. 

She's been emotionally abusive all my life, even now at the age of 21, she treats me like I didn't see or experience a thing. She ignores me. She's only hugged me a handful of times. I can't remember when. 
It's been so long since I've gotten an 'I love you' from her that I can't remember when I last heard even an utterance of the sentence from her mouth. She doesn't know that I take a little over my prescribed dose of klonopin. She doesn't care that I've tried to attempt suicide twice. She doesn't  care that I battle with intrusive thoughts everyday.

She doesn't see me, but I am here.

My father was abusive. 

He beat my mother for years and stopped as he slowly became more and more sick from drug and alcohol abuse. He hurt me too. He was severely bipolar. He died. I found him dead. I get angry when I realize the only parent who acknowledged me just the slightest had hurt me and died.

His side of the family disowned me and my siblings when I was 11. His sister loved me, but was so quick to turn her back. What did I do wrong? 

I let others hurt me. 

I always think people are out to hurt me.

I wish I didn't.

I've met others who have been through worse. They still preserver, they are strong, they know themselves.

I wonder if I'll ever be like them. I wonder if I'll ever be strong. I wonder if I'll ever stop relying on others for love and care. I wonder if I'll ever go a day without having a panic attack at work.

99,"Hi All,

Need advice

My ex and I started dating and I knew she smoked weed as a way to cope with stress. When she was a teenager when she got mixed up with pretty much any drug you can think of but never injected only snorted. This was because of a so called best friend who introduced her to it and to deal with the fact she was molested at a young age. Anyway long story short we noticed her dependency on the weed as it has a high THC count it is very addictive.

She got help as a teenager with the heavier stuff and had been clean for about a year when we started dating she got help through a government scheme but all that stopped when she turned 18. This is when she turned to weed.

Anyway eventually  she asked for help and wanted to get of weed and do it on her own. First this lasted 3 days as I caught her messaging people asking for money (She had quit her job to do the detox I also control the finances) I took her phone away and gave it to her dad to hide but he gave it back to her a few hours later and she went to her so called best friend for 8 hours. She got back at just after 2:00 AM I waited up.

Anyway the next day she said she wanted to go into rehab so we looked at private options which due to cost constraints weren't an option.

I took her away for 14 days and she was clean the whole time her cravings subsided after about 2 or 3 days, we had an amazing 12 days. So we had to return home for her dads birthday and immediately on our way back she started shaking and wanting the high. She said it was because the area reminds her of everything. We were there for 2 days and I had to return to work. She stayed behind as she lives with her parents within 3 hours of my leaving she used weed.

Now for the last week she had barely said much and she lied about where she was and what she was doing (getting high) she hadn't done this to me before.

She used to call me on video while smoking weed. I called her on the lying and said if something didn't change she would loose me. She lied the next day and I called her on it and said it was over this was at about 18:00 PM later that night she called me wanting to talk. So we had it out and I asked how she kept getting the weed she said her dealer added to her existing bill which she does have.

However something wasn't right eventually she admitted she slept with him to pay for the weed that morning. I am obviously a bag of emotions and the trust is broken.

She will be going into a free rehab soon. No idea for how long the program can take up to 18 months. I do love her and want to stand by her we are technically a part and agreed to message as friends for now ( It is still super awkward) Then when she is out of rehab we agreed to go to couples counselling and she will join groups and counselling for continued support.

Even though we are messaging as friends it is as though she is trying to pretend nothing happened. She says she loves me and I haven't lost her and she wants to date me again eventually.

Am I crazy for sticking it out?

How do you cope with the betrayal ?

I don't think she would have done it if she didn't need the fix. However she still did it and I feel like something inside of me has died. She said it was only the once but even if that is true that doesn't matter it still happened.

I completed my teacher training (UK, secondary school level) last year, which I was really proud of because I've had quite a lot going on in my personal life and I didn't think I'd be able to do it, but I did. I got a job at the school I'd been in and we started a few weeks ago.

It's been three weeks and I already feel drained physically but overwhelmingly so emotionally. I knew what I was going into, I knew what the workload would be like but still I dread the evenings and weekends because of the planning and then on a Sunday I dread going into school and having to put on a happy face.

I used to have hobbies that I now haven't been making time for just so that I can stay above water with planning/marking. On top of that I don't feel like I have space in my brain for everything that I need to remember for all the classes/tutor group and extra stuff.

I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm failling. That my colleagues who all have children manage to do the job and manage their work life balance but I can't. I just don't know if I can do this. But I don't know if I'm being silly because it's only a few weeks in.. but I can't really seeing it getting better.

My plan was to work from home tomorrow but there‚Äôs no point, since I‚Äôll just be doing absolutely nothing apart from licking my wounds and depressive sleeping. 

Life goes on but honestly, feels pretty hollow now.",22Sep2019,1
110,"So basically I‚Äôve been close friends with this girl for about a year now. And about a week ago she said something that upset me and I tried to brush it off but then I started thinking about a bunch of other things that she does that bother me. Which made me even more upset. 

So I decided I‚Äôd just take a break and have really barley talked to her all week. We‚Äôre in college so we don‚Äôt have to see each other all the time if we don‚Äôt want to. 

I just feel like I put most of the effort into our friendship that‚Äôs also why I decided to stop talking to her for a bit. Since last week she‚Äôs barley bothered to talk to me. I‚Äôve not really reached out more then maybe once and we just haven‚Äôt  talked. 

I‚Äôm trying to make more friends at school because I think one of my problems was that she was one of my only friends so I put too much effort into it because I didn‚Äôt have many friends. 

But yeah what do you guys think? Should I try and sort things out with her? Is it worth it?",22Sep2019,5
111,Please let me die. Whatever you want from me you're not going to get. I don't have any top secret information. I don't know many people. I don't have anything of value. My mind is already broken and thus cannot be broken by you. Please just let me die and move on to someone or something else.,22Sep2019,1
113,Knee hurts so I put on some bengay and when I pulled up my pants BAM fire balls! I tried to wash it off and it got worse. No idea what to do or how long this will last. I feel like I‚Äôm going to die.,22Sep2019,4

115,"Well title says it all, i basically lost around 4-5 years of my life i'll never get back, after highschool i tried to graduate in something that i didn't like, i quit my college and i have been doing absolutly nothing with my life since then just playing games and going to parties.

I'm still young (21 years old) but i don't want to loose anymore time, i still live with my parents and they are wonderful people, but i'm tired of mooching of them, my brother is almost 30 and still lives here too, i don't want that for me, my mom is willingly to pay for college for me, thing is i have no ideia what to do in college.  


I know this sounds stupids but since i was a kid i liked the ideia of something fantastical yet believable happening, like an A.I gone rogue, some genetic alteration gone wrong and creating some kind of monster, now hear me up, i'm fully aware that those things are work of fiction and will probably never happen in real life, is just something that i have loved since i was a kid.

Saying that i have thought about majoring in: Biomedicine, Computer Sciences, architecture, Pharmacy.  


I'll be honest with you guys, i feel like i am an imbecile i feel like i don't have that burning passion for something like most people have, almost everyone around me seens 100% sure on what they want to do, except for me, hell i don't even know if i posted this on the right place, i want something that makes me money (let's be real, everything is fun and etc but you need money in the world we live in) and also something that doesnt make me want to jump in front of a train everyday, one last thing before ending this rant, i don't like math, and i know that Compute sciences have a LOT of math. 

Sorry for the long rant i just need some advice on what to do, i have been looking through the same pages on the college website about their majors and it's making me crazy.",22Sep2019,1
116," I‚Äôve been single for a good while since loosing my husband. Im in my early 30s!! So yeah.. young. I want to explore a casual thing with someone but I‚Äôm so nervous because I‚Äôm most comfortable having sex with someone I‚Äôm in a relationship with. In the beginning I‚Äôm super awkward and shy. How can I let loose? I learned that life is short and the opportunities come nd go, so take them. Please advice on how to losen up.. I‚Äôm just in my head a lot.",22Sep2019,3
117,"Ive struggled for the past year with being better at things that I love to do. I enjoy playing games but I play them for the wrong reason, I keep wanting to be better at them rather than focusing on having fun. I just want to go back to being naive with the way I improve myself but I keep naturally wanting to go back to trying to optimize my every action, and it isn't fun.

If anyone has advice on how to relax and stop taking things seriously it would be very appreciated ‚ù§Ô∏è",22Sep2019,2
118,"I am happy to announce, I was finally medically cleared this week to continue working with horses in my pre-vet program. I was diagnosed with an adrenal tumor last fall, and then diagnosed with a brain tumor this spring. I spent most of my time confined to a hospital bed on and off since last October. Being unable to ride or work with horses really stripped away a huge part of something that defined me. 

I received a couple of e-mails from an equine rescue who invited me to assist as their on-call veterinary assistant. I already work full time in small animal medicine, but being able to return to the large animal side of my profession is what really completes me. I got to work with horses for the first time in a year and forgot about everything I had been through and felt whole again. Getting back into the saddle made me the happiest I have felt in years. 

I will never take for granted the things that bring me happiness ever again.",22Sep2019,2

120," English is not my native language, sorry for bad grammar.

I had gone to a party with a group of friends at a famous ballad in my area. At about 11 pm, almost midnight, I wanted to leave, and one of my friends said she wanted to go too, and I invited her to come with me. The local street was kind of bad, so we went to a nearby square to ask Uber to get us easier, we sat on a bench and after a few minutes, a motorcycle appeared. The bike had a guy with a relatively pretty body, he was wearing a helmet so I didn't see his face, but he kept looking at us. We looked back and kept laughing, thinking he was flirting with us. It stayed like that for a long time, until he approached us and shouted: ""Pass the cell phone, bitch"". Startled, we gave our cell phones and he left with the bike. We were paralyzed and my friend started crying, I comforted her and after a few minutes Uber arrived.

After that my friend doesn't want to leave with me alone.",22Sep2019,2
121,"Sorry for how messy this is about to be, I just need to put my thoughts somewhere and hopefully get some thoughts back. 

During middle school and early high school I got 5 diagnosed mild concussions (Mind you I received everyone with a helmet on). I know I have had more than that but I ride horses and as a kid you don't want to have to sit in bed all day so I would lie to coaches, doctors and myself. After one of the diagnosed ones I was back on a horse within 2 days and fell off and landed on my head again. I walked into the bushes, puked and then got back on. I didn't tell my parents and never saw a doctor (I know this was a terrible thing to do but I was young and didn't want to stop riding). I was told by emergency room doctors that I would need to stop riding if I got another head injury so I just avoided telling anyone.

Now I am 21 and constantly feel the effects of these. I read up on post concussion syndrome in high school and it really sounds like what I was going through. Not long after the fall 2 days after the original concussion I developed severe depression and anxiety that I am still experiencing to this day. My memory has never been the best because of hitting my head so much but lately it has gotten a lot worse. I can't find my car in a parking lot ever and lose everything. This semester of college has been going on for nearly a month and I still can't remember my weekly schedule. I forget to eat until I get so hungry I'm in pain. I have to write down everything to remember it but I forget to write things down have the time. I also have a lot of problems communicating my thoughts, like there is a block from my brain to my mouth. Theres some other issues too. Im just generally a mess. 

I know I should probably bring this up to someone but Im on the riding team at school and would be devastated to lose out on my senior year, especially with a high likely hood of me making it to nationals this year. Im afraid the athletic trainers would assume I had a recent head injury that Im either lying about or have forgotten.  

I just don't know what to do and feel way too young to be dealing with this on top of various physical issues. Any words of advice or encouragement would be greatly appreciated.",22Sep2019,3
122,"It was at a bar, this girl I'm friends with was drunk, I was drunker, she started grinding on me and then said ""Let's fuck in the bathroom."" Long story short, that's what happened.

I feel gross. It was great sex but I'm not the kind of guy who would do something like that. I mean, fuck in a bathroom. It was clean but eww.",22Sep2019,3
