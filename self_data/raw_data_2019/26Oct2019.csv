2,"I hate hate saying it, but it’s true and I can’t keep avoiding it. All my life I’ve felt inadequate whether it’s by academics, looks, social capabilities. I eventually worked on my social skills, shaped up a bit from my chunky childhood. Can’t seem to get my academics up. I’m a the first child of immigrant parents which really shouldn’t matter but something to throw out there. I’m in my first semester of some crummy ass college in jersey. I’ve come to see my sister has a pretty reputable school reaching out to her on one of those “ad” type things. I should be happy for her and I am but I can’t help feeling like a failure. She’s in hs now and is taking much more advanced classes than I have ever taken and I don’t know anymore. Jealousy i suppose is the real word for all of it. I’m more angry at myself for not being able to do what she does.  There’s more I’d like to go on about... mostly to maybe blame my parents but yeah yeah that’s not the right thing to do. 

Tl;dr: I can’t handle the fact that my sister is succeeding academically more than I could ever had. Feeling down by the fact I go to some shitty school with while my sister is getting notices from schools of a higher reputation. Jealousy? Lmao.",26Oct2019,0

Movies, paranormal shows, mystery/horror books, Halloween etc.I often watch scary movies alone, an avid reader of r/no sleep, love when it’s dark and gloomy outside. Love graveyards. I also enjoy watching people get startled like scare pranks etc. I feel better when it’s night outside rather than day. I also have a very dark sense of humour.

I've done the math and at this rate it could be over a decade until I pay this all off and then my credit still won't be fixed, and at the end of that it's not like I'll get some magic money - making scheme.

9,"I'm currently friends with this girl that I really like, and the two of us have been going out to eat and go to various events and stuff together (one-on-one, not in a group or anything) for the past couple of weeks. But at the moment, I fear I'm kind of approaching the infamous ""friend-zone"" (a term I don't endorse, but it's the closest term I can think of) because while we are fairly close, I have no idea how to actually turn this from something we're doing as close friends into something romantic. I feel like if I don't do something soon then it's really just going to remain that way, but at the same time I really don't feel confident enough to really go the extra mile and make our next outing a proper date, or reveal that I like her in that way at all. There's the typical things of worrying about what she'll think of me and ruining the friendship and all that, of course.

I guess I'm making this post really to just have people tell me the obvious - that I need to properly ask her out and make my intentions clear. I think an outside perspective and people, even strangers, just telling me to do it will give me that push to actually go through with it.

18,"I like the cold. I just prefer it over the heat. I prefer winter over summer. Cold drinks over hot drinks. Cold is good for numbing areas for pain relief. 

I’ve always just chalked it up as me being warm blooded or at least having good blood circulation that my limbs never feel cold to the touch.

Cold drinks are refreshing. Not to knock your coffees and hot cocoas. I just prefer something cold even in the winter instead of something warm or hot.

Summer has its perks. Swimming. Nice weather. You can do things you normally can’t in winter. I’ve always liked cold or cool weather. Do I love spring and fall too? I sure do. 

Why? I’ll put it this way. If I do feel cold I can always layer on the clothing or blankets. Heat? Not so much. You can only go down to your birthday suit. Sure you can cool off by taking nice cold showers. Swim. Splash water in your face and stand in front of a fan. Those feelings are nice relief from the heat. But the keyword being relief. 

I suppose one could argue if you pile on the clothes you are relieving yourself of the cold but warmth from the cold implies something else. That something is the bigger reason why I love the cold. 

Imagine sitting in your bedroom. It’s cold because the heat isn’t on but you have a nest of blankets and pillows. Why not just nestle in the bed and wrapped yourself in those covers? Your face may be cold a little because you didn’t put your face under the covers but that’s to better feel the difference in temperature. Surrounded by fabric. It’s comforting. A feeling not necessarily associated with cooling off. No. It feels like a hug. 

Sure it’s technically your body heat being trapped under the covers and that it’s not another human being sharing their warmth but who thinks about that under the covers? Not me of course.

You see, I’m a very lonely person. I take what I can get. When you’re starved for affection or touch you can almost cry when someone even places a hand on your shoulder. If you are cold the better to feel the warmth. If you were warm or hot all over a touch wouldn’t feel the same.

Cold allows me to feel comfort that I otherwise don’t really feel in my day to day. I don’t get hugs. I don’t get cuddles. No smooches, no massages, no caresses or embraces. No handholding, no tickling, or even handshakes.

It’s ironic to like cold because warmth feels so much better. 

But I’m just so lonely. 

You couldn’t love me without feeling pity. Nobody likes a depressed person. It’s a vicious cycle. I’m sure you know how it goes. 

But if pity is all I can get... well I guess I’ll take that too if you are selling. I’ll feel guilty and stupid for buying but you know what they say. Misery loves company. I love the cold too.",26Oct2019,17

20,"I spoke at a co-workers celebration of life. My co-worker died from complications due to cancer.  His name was Ken. We knew he was sick but we didn\`t know from exactly what. He was literally at work and feeling shitty on Sunday the 6th. We were all worried and wanted him to go to the hospital. He died on Oct. 7th. He was only 64 y/o. Rest in peace and love , my friend....

I knew him since 1980 when we both opened up a hotel in the major city we live. I was 16 and he was 25. We worked together til 1982 and I went to a different hotel to work. I got out of the industry in 1992. I returned to hospitality in 2014. I ran into so many familiar faces from all those years ago, including Ken. It was fun when I first saw him after 25 plus years. Aside from too many years of scotch he looked and sounded the same. I had the best story from when we knew each other all those years ago. I remembered it like it was yesterday. He didn\`t remember me from adam lol It was fine because I appreciated the memory and I shared it with him and thanked him and told him I thought of him everytime I heard an REO speedwagon song.

He loved the hotel like it was his home and he loved his crew and team like family. We were all he had in the end and it literally brakes my heart. I was asked to speak because they knew I had known him for a long time. We werent close but I cared and I appreciated the history of knowing each other since we were kids. I was more than happy and honored to share a great memory I had. There are about 30 ppl or so. from different departments but everyone knows me I am familiar with everyone. Here\`s the memory that makes me appreciate this man.

..."" we met back in 1980. I was a room service operator and he was a line cook. I was young and naive, 16 and still in HS. He was 25. We had a room service waiter who was serving drinks to the band REO Speedwagon . They were pretty big in 1981 and so me being a 16 y/o kid I was really excited they were staying in our hotel. The room service waiter tells me later she told them how excited I was to meet them and they said they wanted to meet me and they would meet up with me after my shift. of course I am freaking out and super excited and I go. I go running to my him and screaming OMG REO speedwagon wants to meet me and they will be waiting for me when I get off work. Ken looks at me and says. "" You are going to change and go out the back door and go home!"" I am not sure what he said to explain the bands intentions were not good. Of course I was horrified that they didnt want to just give me some free tickets. I never forgot what Ken did for me that day but I thought about over the years and I have always appreciated him for saving me from the rock band lol"" I ending it with saying how much I appreciated Ken reminding me of my youth and how I never saw him old. I always saw the young Ken that I first met all those years ago. Those early days of life before too much chaos. I closed with....at the end ,as we take our last breath, the only thing that truly matters is that we are cared about and loved.

23,"I’m not gonna go into much detail here. What I can say is that my life is not at all what i wanted it to be. I suffer from pretty bad anxiety and depression and I feel it only gets worse with age. I have 3 small kids and sometimes I know they’re the only thing that keeps me going, but they deserve a mom much better than that.

My life has been fucked from the start. Bad decisions as a young adult mixed with shit luck and mental issues just doesn’t mix well. I am the one my “friends” call any time for help or advice, but I can’t get that back from anyone nor can I ever listen to my own advice.

I’m completely burnt out. 2 steps forward, 10 steps back and I’ve almost just come to expect no more. I wanted more out of life, but clearly I’ll never get it. Sometimes I really just want to give up. 

I have a very large family. I’m not sure what I’ve done to them...I think it’s just that I’m a product of my parents, maybe? My grampa cared but my uncle accidentally killed him about 10 years ago. Family fell apart after that and now I will reach out, but I can’t get a single person to ask how I’m doing.

My mom kicked me out at 15 to start a new family. That didn’t end well for her, as he turned out to be a real piece of shit. But we were so good before then, I wonder what it would be like had he never come around. Nobody cares. Nobody asks about my kids. 

I just want to feel like I’m not alone in this world. I’m not thinking of killing myself or anything (tho I am definitely not scared of death.) I’m 31 and I don’t think things will ever change.

Apologies for format and this being all over the place. I just started typing and kept. I have so much inside of me that needs to be let out. I just don’t understand why I had to be born like this. Why does my mind hate me so much? Why cant I just be “normal?”",26Oct2019,1
24,"I took out a line of credit as a student about 25 years ago. It was small then and I barely used it. After being denied student loans one year (stupid rule about having a newborn child born after Sept 1st) the LOC greatly increased in size, and again after separating from my son's mom during my degree. Fast forward many years, it topped out at $40,000. I've slowly whittled away at it, but then last year I ended another relationship, got sick, had surgery, had to move 3 times until my son and I found our next home, and was off work for 2½ months. It was another financial hit. This spring/summer I made some financial changes and started to get ahead.

Then this am I made my final payment. I'm just beside myself. That LOC has haunted me for so long. Anyway. I'm happy. That's all.

25,"I have always wanted a girlfriend but I never got to that point with any woman. Things always went bad, they would make me their back up guy and use me for attention. My birthday is soon and I will be 25, another year single and a virgin.

I dont care about how love or whatever can happen at any age, I am pretty much over it. Being treated like garbage by those women I went on dates with and tried my best to make it work with them, seeing an ex friend with the one woman I never got over and thought we would really work out, not knowing what a relationship or sex is like at this age. I just cant seem to look at women the same anymore.

I dont know if Im ugly, but I do feel like it even though I take care of myself, dress well, have a good job, have good hygiene, etc. But at this point I feel very worthless and significant to women, I just know it. I can never see myself with them, even trying to imagine myself with any woman I find remotely attractive is impossible. And Im sure I will get hate for this but I can never be with a woman in college or be her first anything. Anyone I could meet will be older and have a past, which is fine for people to have, but I will never meet anyone who I can learn about love and sex with or grow with. 

I dont want some woman who will ""teach"" me or whatever, I want to be special to them. I wanted someone who wont compare me to other guys, someone who is attractive. I dont want to start my first relationship or have my first sex partner when Im old, it will never be as good as I ever dreamed of. I dont even think it would be great now if I met someone like that now. I never expected things to last if I ever met someone like that, but I just wanted experiences while everyone was having them especially in college when it was so easy to meet women.

I have spent a majority of this year just laying in bed, Ive lost all motivation to actually go out or do anything. I recently went on a date and the woman wanted to come over for a second date, she then cancelled the day of because she wasnt fully over the guy who ghosted her that she was seeing before. I have to deal with that now, I have to deal with their pasts if I want to date them. I will be the guy finishing last because the other guys treated them like crap and I never got to be first in any way.

I just dont know what to feel anymore. I dont want to be some 40 year old who ends up with some woman who got to live her life fully and now wants me to settle down with her, get married, have kids with her, and take care of them. I never got to live my life and have experiences but that is all I will ever be, just the guy who shows up at the end to pick up whats left.

At work I get berated by my current supervisor and feel like I have no spine. I have no spine anywhere in my life it seems anyways. I dont know whether to find a new job or put up with her at this point. I have pretty much no social life, my supervisor is pretty much the only person I talk to on a daily basis so thats a real treat. I am just living to go to work and then sleep for a few hours before I do it again. 

I dont really know where to go from here. Im not sad or happy, Im just going by the motions, I dont expect life to pick up tomorrow or years from now, I am not working towards some goal, I am not waiting for anything. I am just here, trying not to break down crying from my past or by my job or by my worthlessness and meaningless self to women. I dont know where to go or who to talk to or what to do. I just know I am working and then going to sleep and then repeating it all over again every day and staying in on weekends until the next work day. I created some dating app profiles for the millionth time in my life and I just swipe to do something with my time I guess.

I dont get matches, especially not with the women I want, and I know Im not good enough for any woman on there or in general. But it at least tricks me into thinking I am.

I am just venting I guess.",26Oct2019,10
26,"Currently, I have thousand things going through my mind. You would say it sound ver normal for someone my age. I thibk it goes beyond that. 

I apologise for misspellings. I've been crying and trying to write this as short as possible. I'm sorry. 


To this point, I've gone through a lot of things. Things that have built a really low self-confidence in me, or I least I think that's the reason. 

I consider myself an intelligent person, though. I've recently achieved things I could have never imagine they would happen this soon to me, but there are still lots of negative thoughts that stop me from going for my dreams. 

I feel alone. The friends I made during the past year, are now way to far away from me and I'm afraid of not being able to see them again in my life. I'm afraid the distance breaks what has been so difficult for me to build. 

I feel I want more than I can get. I can't afford a University abroad and I can't study where I'm from because of political problems and a really severe economical situation in my family. 

I want to study. In the future, I want to study and work at something that makes me feel good and also where I can get enough to help my family get out of this situation. 

I want to help, but I don't know where to start or where to go. Everything seems to be so difficult and dark I can't go through and there's no-one to help me.

I've been also resently in love for the first time. I fell for someone who seemed to, but doesn't actually feel the same way for me. 

I've never met someone who cares about me in that very special way. Ever. I've always liked guys who were complete assholes to me and ended up bullying me. But this one was different. I felt special and complete. It went all wrong and I blame myself and my clumsiness for it. 

At this point, I feel completely lost and confused. Everything seems to be going down around me. 
I have no hobbies. I have no chance to dedicate myself to art, as I would love to. I've no chance to  get into a Uni and study. 

I don't want to have suicidal thoughts again, as I did at school. 

I'm crying again while writing this. I have a lot more to say, but no will to make this impossible to read.

28,"I work as a waitress (part-time) at a local restaurant. Yesterday morning when I went to work, the outside table was dirtied with cigarettes, pizza sauce stains (we don't sell pizza so they must've brought outside food) that wouldn't easily come off and some rubbish. It took me a while to clean them but I eventually got it done. This morning I got a call from my boss regarding this table. She sounded mad and frustrated and was pouring it all out on me. She said that one of the wooden gates behind the table had stains and were not cleaned until she arrived this morning. I told her I didn't even see the stain (as I was busy doing other things and didn't notice) but she sent me pictures of the dirty table and the stained gate. The picture was taken before my shift yesterday, meaning she saw how unclean the table was but didn't even notify me or decide to clean it herself. I worked morning and night yesterday with another co-worker during the night shift. It was my fault for not noticing the gate during the daytime but I wasn't the only one who didn't notice it. My co-worker who also went outside a few times never noticed the stain. I guess it's on me for not checking the entire store by myself but I know that it's not a reason to tell someone it's their last chance. I only worked there for 3 months and only made minor mistakes during the first month. When she was shouting at me over the phone, I started to tear up and didn't even get to speak up for myself. She asked me if I had any excuses for not cleaning the gate and I said no, I just didn't notice it and apologised. After this phone call I now hate myself for being a cry baby. I don't know why I always tear up when I'm being cornered. I want to be emotionless so I don't feel anything. I have negative thoughts and no one to talk to. I just hate myself.",26Oct2019,5

I just don’t really know myself anymore. I kill at least a 5th every day and usually still feel nothing at the end of it now. I’m getting tired of it but, asking for help for mental or physical problems is a huge Nono and career killer in my battalion. I pretend to want to have sex with females and shit like a normal male, cause that’s the only way to not be viewed as some weird piece of shit at my unit. All this to try and seem normal and be ignored while I struggle with shit that I thought I got over ( I still have vivid nightmares where I feel every hit and insertion). And because drugs (even though I theoretically do them) are not allowed for me and, alcohol is pretty much the only thing that makes me numb if I drink enough. I waste my entire paycheck on booze just to drown the pain. But even though I know it will never work I still drink heavily. Because I hold out for those rare days where my body can’t take anymore and alcohol actually works. I’ve been on a bender for the last 2 months and I don’t like being sober. I feel like I’m turning into my father because now I’m getting angry and hateful towards people who do nothing to set me off. And it scares me that I’ve gone down this path and I just can’t stop. It doesn’t matter how many times I try and stay sober I just can’t. I’m tired of always doing this loop but where I’m at right now I can’t put the bottle down I can’t open up and get help. I’ve tried talking to my closet friends but they just end up ghosting me when I’m going through shit. Besides a few special 2 or 3 but they do not deserve what I put them through. And who can blame them honestly what young adult out there can actually help with that shit. I only have when I get out of the army to hope for when I can actually get help again. But that’s a year and a half away and I seriously don’t think I can make it that far. I can’t stress enough how tired I am of being this way but I can’t do anything about it. I don’t want my life to be like this but every time I try being sober I hate myself more and my nightmares are constant. Some times I find myself asking why or how am I still alive when I have nothing to offer the world. There’s nothing to me besides constant sorrow. I ask myself what can I do to change but I come up with nothing. Why do I let every emotion build up like this? Why can’t I be fucking happy for once in my current life for once? Why am I stuck on all these why’s? I need help but can’t get it without a constant flow of hate with a majority of those I work with. Why am I me? Why can’t I just be comfortable with myself anymore?  Why do I push away people who genuinely want to help? Why do they accept me for me? I’m fucking broken and these people don’t deserve to cope with my bullshit. I need help but don’t know where to turn. what sucks is this isn’t all my shit going through my head right now.

31,"Internet usage starts with users querying information they want, and services learning/adapting to deliver information in a format/context based on their activity. This has created some stellar search tools, a personalized network of services and communities available to people, and made the internet a paradise for new content from all over the world.  Despite that all the information in the world is available to us, we only seek out what we want to see/hear/read and then get fed new information based on those queries. It doesn't lead to free exchange of ideas and values, it has created polarized societies where we are digitally segregated by our own sense of identity and community.  People talk a lot about the political side of this, the ""echo chambers"" online. But I think it's worse than that. We see racial segregation on Twitter, feedback loops of content on YouTube that reinforce themselves, news outlets tailoring their content for users that reach them from their own site and optimizing for usage metrics that feed usage metrics... and we all are in love with it.  It reminds me of Farenheit 451 in the sense that this almost-dystopia wasn't created by some fascist dictator or single-party state; we built it ourselves. We wanted it.  That's not to say there isn't beauty on the internet, and we live in an era where more people talk and share and love and fight more than ever with language and ideas.

My friends are all gone. Maybe one left but I'm sure I'll fuck that one up soon enough. I've romanced so much that I forgot how to build a bond of friendship. Maybe that's because I've never had to do it before.

My only remaining guy friend is Charles. I'm just not interested in anyone else besides a romantic or a sexual appeal. Friendships can't be engineered, they have to develop naturally. That won't happen to me again here.

I gotta get out of this tiny fucking town. I keep pushing and pushing as hard as I can trying to make it come sooner but I still have three-fourths of a school year left, and nothing I do will end it sooner. I'm getting near-perfect scores in all my classes, yet they drag on anyways. The immense, deep hatred I have for the town I live in is motivating me more than anything else in my life has before. 

My ""girlfriend"" and I aren't even in love. We cuddle and have sex because we're sick of being cold and alone. We're just trying to keep each other alive until we can get out. When one of us can leave, we leave. No looking back, no hesitation. It may not be everything, but it's nice to have each other. We're not close enough to make us want to twist our future paths to be together, which I think is a good thing.


Sometimes, I let it get to me. I sit in my minivan after a school day and the one friend I have a class with goes to her boyfriend and her other friends and I can just feel the warmth drain out of me. I'm stuck here and I'm forced to watch everyone else live out what I can't have.

Then, the emptiness, the sadness turns to anger. Frustration and rage. I don't have anyone to blame. Not even myself. I know I don't deserve this. I only blame this tiny fucking microcommunity. It's impossible to make friends here. It's always just cold. Not freezing, not snowy, hell not even frigid. Just cold and grey. 

Last year I had friends. I felt so fulfilled and so content with my life that I was living out adventures and everything. 

Everyone knows me. Everyone has determined what I am in their eyes. 

I'm that kid in my school's top choir class. I'm the director's very favorite. His star child. I have the beautiful, gifted voice that resonates through the room during rehearsal. My classmates love it too, but it doesn't get me anywhere. 

I'm that tall white guy that everyone thought would turn out to be a school shooter in middle school. They don't even know how afraid I was of something like that happening. 

I'm so smart, I work with computers. This guy built his own in freshman year. 

He solved a Rubik's cube in middle school, I think? 

That's it.

I'm somehow this immensely well-liked person while simultaneously constantly passed over. 

The senior year is special, my director says. You only get to experience it once, and it shouldn't be taken for granted. He taught this to a class of middle school children right in front of me. If I had felt even a taste, in my freshman year, of what it feels like now, I would've graduated early without a second thought.

I don't even want to go to sleep. I have a field trip with my choir in the morning, but I don't want to go to sleep. I've had dreams the past two weeks. A continuity of dreams. Survival scenario, combat scenarios. Exhausting dream after exhausting dream, each one just as grey and as cold as the reality I wake up to. There's just this resounding theme of disgust, wasteland-esque environments. Like I'm in a less populated Fallout scenario.

I hate who I am right now. I hate where I'm at. I have to deal with it for another year. Maybe two or three until I can acquire the funds to move out of state.

I dated my friends, and I lost them. And everything that came with them.

--And no, I don't have depression. I feel depressed quite often, but that's because I'm lonely. People don't deal too well when they're alone, and they have to see people who aren't alone. People who have the connections that they wish they had.--

This is depression. That's what it is. I see people's glamourized ideals of their lives on social media and I'm comparing it to my own. Fuck, I'm a textbook case. Alright, snapchat has to go. I've got to get around to seeking help, I just haven't found the time.",26Oct2019,1
35,"I just wanted to write this now before I forget the feeling. There are many things I’m thinking about, and I don’t even know how to proceed. Yesterday was my 18th birthday and I was excited to tell her what I felt. I applied to college in this time, was accepted, and my mother was cured of cancer. I’m always sad on my birthdays, but as the day progresses I gained more security by speaking to my family and feeling like I’m worth it. I decided to actually go to a friend’s party (whose birthday is also today) and tell this girl what I feel.

If I had to describe her, I’d say I like her image. I’ve been seven years without her and, while I’m the dedicated school nerd, she went into a different path. I’ve still had her in the back of my mind though. This summer I was fairly depressed and I simply liked no one (this has almost never occurred). I went on NoFap to be more objetive, but she popped into my mind. I’ve liked her more throughout the past few months and I’ve been trying to talk to her. I almost FU because I told her I wanted to see her in person to tell her I “something” and she just never responded. She still spoke to me at school and such, but I had to say it.

Today, I built up the courage throughout my day to tell her. I approached her as my most honest self. I was nervous and laughing, but it was me. I told her everything and she actually listened. My friends say she didn’t actually take it too well. She told me she was not interested and she didn’t even know what to say. I didn’t care; all I wanted was that moment of close proximity to another person. I experienced it and that brought me happiness. I could definitely sense her surprise and a little of flattery arrogance for the fact that I told her, but the moment was amazing. I was most disappointed and saddened that it ended. I could’ve said more; spoke to her about more than that. Good thing is, that we are on good terms (she was the one who said that).

At this point then, I don’t know what to think. She might’ve been lying, she said she was unsure about herself and what she wanted. Before, I just wanted to kiss her; now, I like her as a person. Of all the people I’ve confessed to, she has been the kindest. Tomorrow I’ll send her a message to thank her for listening. I’m afraid of all the mistakes I’ve done, and I just want to be honest and have someone listen to myself. That moment was surreal and it brought some liberation. I feel like I can breathe differently. It was simply about doing it. I think for now the best is to rest. Thank you; that’s all I’ll have to tell her.",26Oct2019,3

37,At the age of 25 it seems I have cut loose or simply growing apart from everyone I was close to. I sold most my shit(wasn't much) and moved halfway across the country to avoid a winter of unemployment. Now I'm in a small northern Nevada town. I don't know anyone besides the aunt I moved in with. The job opportunity I was told about was a fluke and now I need to find any employment without having a car. This seems like the lowest I've ever been in life. I keep telling myself it's just the dark before the dawn but some positive motivation would be nice. It's almost funny. This is the best shape I've mentally and physically been in my entire life and Im spending it stuck in a mobile home alone broke as a joke. How have yall gotten over what seems like a midlife crisis?,26Oct2019,2
38,"So as the title says it's difficult for me to talk about my feelings with others. I've always been introvert and shy. I never had a lot of friends and even with my best friend I rarely really talked about feelings. I always kept my thoughts and feelings for myself and dealt with them mostly alone. The only one I talked to about them would be my mom.

Since one year I have a boyfriend and I have the feeling, me not taking about my feelings and thoughts openly isn't good for our relationship. For example a few days ago he said something in the moment he probably didn't thought about 2 seconds after it, but it really hurt my feelings and has been on my mind since then. I don't know how to address this and it happened a few days ago. And there are some other things that I would like to talk about. Like his behavior in regards to a specific topic and a thing that concerns his ex. But... I just can't. I don't know. It's so hard and I'm not good with words.

The other point is that I cry easily when I'm emotional. I really really hate that. I guess it makes you look weak and bitchy if you cry about so little things, but I can't control it. It just happens. And that makes it even harder to talk about, especially negative, feelings with my boyfriend. He is always so worried and apologetic when I cry. Which is very sweet and lovely, but not helpful when I want to talk about things. I don't want him to feel bad about himself for making me cry.

Sooo yeah. I hope it wasn't too confusing. Maybe some of you have a suggestion how to overcome this or have the same issues. Thanks for reading it.",26Oct2019,0
39,"example: when I am talking to specific friends I am always optimistic and positive and never aggressive. when I'm around my family I'm in a bad mood, aggressive and my own voice is extremely annoying to me. when I'm chatting on the internet I'm also pretty different and mostly very positive,

40,"i'm writing this if anyone else can relate or am i just a coward ?

i can't study. for years i have spent every second of my life in guilt regretting not studying. i get so anxious when i start studying my heart starts beating faster i start panicking since i couldn't study from childhood. now studying is like a phobia. my mind drifts off when i'm studying and i don't even know it sometimes...

sometimes i tell myself it's because i don't have anything to live for. really i can't think of anything to work hard for. and the greed for good food clothes and life just isn't enough to make me go through this shit hard life everyday.

or maybe it's a mental disability since  my sibling have OCD and also other members of my family have different mental disorders. they all had really fucked up lives. but fixing that is not an option in this third world country... 

In country like mine you have to study or end up homeless or a trashman i see that everyday outside my house. it's so weird even intense fear like that can't make me study. I'm so sick of this life all i want is either the courage to kill myself or something to fight for everyday.",26Oct2019,21
41,How do you get over someone who you're still very close friends with and most likely can't distance yourself from without creating more problems?,26Oct2019,2
42,"Seriously. This is a warning you absolutely NEED to heed.

I have no idea what made women, more specifically women under 30, so vicious and cruel to men with small penises. But if you are small, take it to your fucking grave. Once a woman finds out about it, you will instantly become a subhuman piece of dirt in her eyes.

That beautiful, kind girl you've known since you were a kid? She'll literally treat you like a pedophile if you have a small dick. It's disgusting how women place SO MUCH VALUE on a sex organ while lying to men and saying ""size doesn't matter"" because they don't want to admit how shallow they are.

Women are the most horrifyingly cruel creatures you can imagine if you are one of us unfortunate men. Leave them to the men with normal-sized penises, since those are the only men they treat with respect.

Women only see you as human if your dick isn't small. What a sad joke.",26Oct2019,0
43,"Probably the lowest point I’ve been in my life.

At the start of uni 4 years ago I was the best version of me I’ve ever been. At the end, the worst. I still graduated from a Russle Group Uni with a 2:1 though so that’s good. 

I studied philosophy. I love philosophy and think it is immensely underrated. Especially in the jobs market.

It isn’t necessarily the reason why I can’t get a job. The reason is because my mental health has taken a dive. 

First I was anxious, so I withdrew. That then made me depressed. Now I’m an anxious, terrified mess. 

I struggle to do the prep for interviews because I have no motivation. And I have panic attacks during the interviews. 

I’m terrified of the future. Scared of going to a job everyday that has no meaning. One that I might hate.",26Oct2019,3
44,"With *me*, it was usually the amount of time between opening my mouth, and sound coming out.
 

One time I looked at her as I was walking and didn't see the ""Piso Mojado"" sign I accidentally kicked from in front of the elevators, knocking it flat and sending it skidding fifty feet across the polished granite floor and under a woman's foot, causing her to loose her balance and start windmilling her arms, loosing her grip on four quarts of faux quartz of millennial massage molecules, which break upon landing, the warm oil spreading like warm oil as she falls backward toward the arms of a man who must throw his two extra jumbo hot, extra wet teabag drowning juice into the air while the oil sets the Postal Delivery Service Representative (PDSR) sliding behind his slidecart toward whatever fate awaits whomever pushes his pushcart into a twenty foot high panel of glass at six miles per hour while twenty callow cub scouts who can't be corralled by calling are culled from the collapsing crowd by the cops who slip into something more comfortable when the firemen - the sliding oil-men- go gliding by, Halligans in handing out candy to randy Andy and the teabag juice has begun to descend on a man and a friend going toward the North End to consume as they spend while wearing sombreros they wove with duende and several surveyors surveying the scene said ""Slippery, Slattery, Slaughter and Peen, just give us your numbers then go vent your spleen"" while the Baker rolled by, well really he ""glid"", but ""glide"" has no tenses, and that's what he did as a card-carrying courier carrying custom cardamom capsules crashed calamitously into the Viking vendor, crushing countless cups capable of calming clammy clavicles quickly and cleanly as WHAM! and I'll end this right here, that's the way that I am.",26Oct2019,1
45,"She passed away earlier this week. 95 years old. My grandpa passed a few years back. They were married for over 65 years. I won't be able to go to her funeral on the 31st because the plane tickets are too expensive. Being an expat sucks in a lot of ways, and this is one of the ways it sucks the worst. :(

My grandma was awesome. She taught me every card game I know. She kept a running tally of our wins/points. Before she went into hospice and got too old and frail to play with me anymore, the tally ended in the thousands. I was leading. I still don't know how many of those points I actually earned vs how many of them she let me win.

When I was 16, I dyed my hair bright green while away at camp. My mom lost her shit upon my return, and when my grandma came over, my mom shrieked, ""LOOK what she's done?!""

My grandma took a breath and then smiled at me. ""Well, I think that's a lovely shade of green.""

When I moved in with my boyfriend at 20, my mom told me to wait a bit to tell grandma, since she was ""from a different time,"" and probably wouldn't like me""living in sin."" My grandma, when I did break the news, burst out with a delighted laugh and told me she thought this would be SUCH a blessing to my relationship!

(It wasn't, but who's counting? The woman kept track of my card game scores, keeping track of all my failed relationships on top of that would have been an impossible feat.)

She used to have a picture of me on her mantel, with my ex-boyfriend. He was standing behind me, arms around me and chin on my shoulder. She had pictures of all us grandkids, but I'm the oldest. I was the only one with a boyfriend, the only one living on my own.

After we broke up, the first time I went back to visit grandma, I discovered that she had literally cut my ex out of the picture.

Pretty sure it's the jilted ex - me - that traditionally does that?

But grandma wasn't that traditional. She married young and had kids young and didn't give two shits about naysayers. She prayed every single morning and evening, and wanted to make sure all us kids - grandkids and great grandkids alike - knew she was listing us all one by one, by name, so God would be sure to bless us.

The last thing she said to me was when I FaceTimed my sister's phone. My sister holding the phone so grandma could see, my mom and my aunt in the room, all of us teary - except grandma of course.

She just told me she loved me, and then wanted to make absolutely sure, just one more time, that I knew she was mentioning me - and my son and siblings and cousins and nieces and nephews and--

I know, grandma.

I expressed sorrow I couldn't be at her side in the hospice, but mentioned that I was gonna try to come home for the funeral. My grandma told me not to bother, ""It's just a long flight for no reason."" But to me, it mattered a lot. :( ""Psht,"" she told me, ""Just come over next time you're home, and put up some nice decorations. It took me way too many minutes to realize she was asking me to put flowers on her grave.

The last thing she said to me was, ""What a world we're living in, so I can be here and see your face on this screen, and you can see mine, and we can talk to each other! What a wonderful thing. What a miracle.""

That's true at least, thank goodness for small favors.

She leaves behind two children, five grandchildren, and five great-grandkids.

I miss you, grandma. :(",26Oct2019,3
46,"I think dreams often have meaning or some subconscious message. 

I just woke up from a terrifying dream and I don't know what to make of it. Can't find anything on Google.

The dream was that there was a pure force of evil; a sort of black, plastic-ish cloud/stream. In the dream, this danger was known of, and me and other people kept migrating and moving to be ahead of it, because it was consuming everything.

Near the end of my dream, I looked out a window and saw a giant sort of sattelite dish on a building, beaming the evil black force into the cosmos. It was an effort to get it out of our world.

Suddenly, I saw the black cloud starting to rapidly spread and consume everything outside. It crept through every crevice and hole, and basically fried/killed everyone it touched. The character I was dreaming of was killed this way.

Then I saw the evil personified; blonde and looking like a Norse God, walking through the streets, corrupting everything around him. He would jeer and mock people as he horribly disfigured and killed them. For example, he grabbed one person and covered her with his hands and she came out as a zombie, attacking her former friends. 

At this point, I was semi-aware I was dreaming as I usually do when a dream terrifies the fuck out of me. I tried to dream up a way to defeat it, but the dream wouldn't come back.

Anyone who can help me figure out what my subconscious meant?

I'm thinking maybe it has to do with my fear of climate change as an unstoppable Force, that will bring the rise of fascism with it?",26Oct2019,1

50,"I'm a single 18 year old geek in ma last year of high school, and I can't really say I'm like, actively looking for someone to be with, not that I don't want it, tbh I'd love to be in a relationship. Buuut I'm not great at initiating conversations with random people, not necessarily girls, it has to be natural, like someone in class or work or whatever and get to know them. Which is probs why dating apps or websites have never worked for me lol

But anyway! Getting off topic here sorry
I dunno why, but really recently I just started having a big preference for british redhead girls with curly hair. Not sure why. Like, whenever I go to the UK to see family, I always see a few girls with ginger curly hair and my god they're just so beautiful. I mean it's a matter of taste of coursen but the girls I've seen I've found them all really attractive. And freckles are even cuter imo, like on the cheeks yknow? And some of these girls have like really pale skin, idk if most people are not really attracted to that but I know I am. 

And dont get me wrong here, when I say I'm ""into"" those kind of girls with those looks, it's not in like an arousal type of way, not really. Like I don't start sweating profusely or get a raging boner LOL

No, I just find girls with ginger hair really, really pretty. I know I emphasize on the hair a lot, but it's not just that! There's the hair, and then they always have a really cute face with a cute nose or something, idk I just find it adorable and cute. And I mentioned them being british too because, well most redheads I've seen are british, seen them in the UK, but also I like the UK accents. I'm English myself, and idk why but I've always told myself that if I ever wanted to get in a relationship and try to meet someone, it'd be someone from the UK.  Dunno why. I just love the English accent, Scottish or Irish accents are even cooler imo, and I cant say I've heard the Welsh accent.

But anyway yeah, idk why I've just got a thing for british redheads. They're just really pretty.

53,"To preface this I'm not writing to toot my own horn because this has been a recurring trend within my life and it's made it extremely difficult to find a ""good"" woman. Here we go!

1) Don't think he's settling for you. He's not. Average looking women are ""marriage material."" He wants a serious relationship with you. Don't take that for granted. It's difficult to hold down an attractive girl because there's always a guy with more money, more status and a bigger dick waiting for an opportunity to steal her from you, which makes us insecure and then things get stupid and complicated (this goes both ways). 

2) Don't think he gets around just because he's good looking. When you're good looking you have opportunities everywhere, but that doesn't mean we pounce on them. No, instead, we never do because why should we? We don't owe these women anything. Heck, that handsome guy you're fawning over might be a virgin!

3) When you start dating don't start showing him off like he's a freaking trophy. DO NOT DO THIS! We are not stupid. We pick up on this behavior straight away. Don't introduce him to your family within a week of dating. Don't introduce him to your friends every chance you get. Don't take pictures of you two together and then post them on facebook/insta/whatever. He knows what you're doing. Do NOT set things up so every time you do something together it's with one of your friends. This behavior is extremely self-centered, ego-driven and downright ROTTEN and it will destroy your relationship faster than anything short of cheating and lying. It shows him that you are dating him for all the wrong reasons. Attractive people have to deal with this crap their entire lives, everywhere they go, everyone they date. What they want is someone who appreciates them for who they are, not what they are.

4) We KNOW there are men in your life that would love to sleep with you! That's expected, and fine, depending on how you handle it. If you're shopping for groceries together and you run into that guy who's been crushing on you, what do you do when he starts flirting with you? You shut him down IMMEDIATELY. You do not humor even a second of it. You introduce your new BOYFRIEND (yes, say the word boyfriend) and then say good bye and walk away. You DO NOT blush and respond to his flirting with more flirting and then tell your handsome new boyfriend how attractive and awesome he is. (Yes, this happened to me. Can't you tell? It's safe to say that relationship didn't last long.)

Now to get into some basic stuff that I've seen most women do:

5) He's not stupid. He pretends to be stupid to see your true character. He's testing you. He'll play dumb to see if you will try to manipulate him. Every woman shit tests; this is how men shit test. We want a woman with a pure heart. Don't be an evil bitch!

6) If there's kids involved keep them away for at least the first few months. Don't bring your kid to your first date. This isn't for his sake, or your sake, it's for the kid's sake. Men want a woman (mother) who puts their children first, because that's how men operate (usually). The well-being of the child is and always will be priority. The moment you put yourself before your kid he will start second guessing things. And yes, if your child is young and you've been raising them on your own... IT'S FINE TO GET IMPATIENT AND FRUSTRATED! We understand. If you say ""I need a break"" we will respect that. That doesn't make you a bad mother. Heck, we got involved with you to help you! As long as you don't start neglecting the child or screaming at them or hitting them, we're good. 

7) NEVER give us sex and then cut us off. IT'S NOT ABOUT SEX AT THIS POINT. IT'S ABOUT PLAYING GAMES. Do not give us ultimatums and hold things over our heads. This will destroy your relationship. It's the principle of the thing. Yeah, we want sex, we're guys. It's fine if you're ""not in the mood"" or on your period or whatever, but if you completely cut us off for ANY reason then you are the problem, not him. Cutting us off from sex is the most common way I've seen women intentionally kill a relationship, and then they get to run around gossiping to their friends about how ""he just wanted sex, he didn't love me! BOO HOO POOR ME HE'S AN EVIL JERK BLAH BLAH BLAH"" It's about sooooooo much more than just sex. No man wants to marry a manipulator! Don't be a bitch!

8) Last but not definitely not least: You have the babymaker. This gives you almost alllllllllllllllllll of the power in a relationship (marriage). The simple thing here, which I've already stated a few times, is don't hold it over our heads. It's far easier for men to find partners later in life than it is for women. Don't forget that! Time is on our side. Appreciate your man and the things he sacrifices for you.

9) Women marry up, and men marry down! This is how our society works! It's VERY difficult for a man to survive in a marriage where he married up. As in, marrying someone much younger and more attractive than him, or a woman who's the breadwinner, or a woman who's in a position of power (politician, district attorney, whatever). This sort of situation is difficult for men to deal with. It's a daily attack on our pride. And women want a rich, handsome, prominent man with a huge weiner! Women always tell themselves ""why should I settle? I deserve better!"" ..... EVEN WHEN THEY'RE MARRIED WITH KIDS. They're always shopping for a new, better man. This is why women flirt around and cheat more often than men. Women walk into every relationship thinking ""he'll do, for now.""

61,"I've noticed that when I message girls I REALLY fancy, it reminds me a lot of my texting conversations with my ex (when we were a thing). This is a very bad thing because it causes me a lot of stress. 


For instance, I am too afraid to take any risks when it comes to texting because I fear rejection too much. I send safe messages that have no element of risk in them. 


What bothers me the most is how I count the minutes and hours that person was last active online and when they last replied to me. I go through this cycle all day where I overthink everything and I keep thinking that I wrote the wrong thing or said the wrong thing and that I'm a failure, when really there is nothing I could say that is right or wrong: things are the way they are and nothing really matters. But my irrational part keeps getting the better of me and I spend the whole day catastrophizing over absolutely nothing. I cannot concentrate on things like work or revision because I am too scared not getting a reply. For some reason it's as if the world is falling apart, which is a very similar feeling I had whenever I texted my ex (when we were a thing). I cannot help but overthink it to oblivion. 

I know that they have their own lives and are probably busy but like I said my irrational part keeps getting the better of me.

And whenever they do reply I feel this incredible surge of relief as if my life is now ok. But then that relief is quickly replaced with the dreadful thought that I have to reply, and so out of fear of feeling more anxiety and dread, I decide to ignore their message for most of the day. You see, I know that once I do reply I will repeat the cycle and spend the whole day agonising over them not getting back to me.

What to do? This sucks",26Oct2019,1
62,"I eat pretty healthily I would say, but for a while now I’ve been wanting to try out the gym to see whether I’d like it and whether it would help me feel more confident. The only issue is that I have social anxiety, so going out to new places alone really sets me off. I also don’t have anybody to go with either, which sucks as it would make me feel much more comfortable. 

I’m also unsure of what to try out first. There’s a group cycling class on Sunday or there’s a body combat class, I’m not sure which one I’d be better off trying (maybe the cycling one as less people have booked it).

66,"Okay so this probably doesn’t seem like a big deal &amp; I’d hate to jinx myself but I’ve had this pretty shitty cold for the past 2 weeks but I also have asthma so every time I get the slightest bit of a cold I have to see a doctor &amp; get put on medications and the whole 9 yards to avoid getting worse. However, I’m super busy all the time so I didn’t really want to make time for an appointment and I don’t have the money for the copay &amp; medicine itself so I figured I can just work on it myself and see how that goes.

I was pretty much just downing a shit ton of water &amp; tea everyday &amp; I made sure to bundle up before I left the house, (nothing special).

70," 

Trying to figure out I'm im a sociopath because certain people are probing me with different kind of tests, which makes me feel horrible and makes me feel like i'm some monster that isnt aware of it.

I'll try to give as many pointers for you to conclude or have an idea.

Being reckless at times and doing things like smashing windows, stealing some food/clothes, being asshole to family/friends, using mdma for about 4 months to ease the depression and thoughts of suicide , drinking, starting fights on streets with those who seem to present treat to others ( a key point that might matter, I would never hit anyone with full power, at the back of mind I never wanted to actually damage anyone but I wanted them to learn and also I wanted to express my own pains ) - All of that was between age 16 - 20 , I also wanted to be seen as a bad ass, because I was bullied and rejected by my peers prior to age 16.

And here is the worst thing I have done :

I was around 12 and there was a 16 year old girl I fell in love with. We found 3 kittens without her mother, the girl started to tell me how they kittens will suffer and die of hunger or get killed by other animals and we should do something, so we tried to feed them, I tried to take them home to keep them, I tried asking random strangers to keep them but nothing worked. The girl was trying to convince me on killing them so they dont die in pain, she gave me a rock and told me to do it, for about an hour I was resisting and then I did it, we burried them and I never seen the girl again. I was coming back to that place for days and crying and asking for forgiveness because of what I have done, I tried to make it up by leaving food and my favorite toys in the ground, I saw the kittens mother looking for them, which completely killed me, I was crying and remembering them for about 2 years until it settled and I forgave myself.

As to shine a little light on how I feel about people, I always want to help people, I put others in front of myself, I am naive ( less now ) but I constantly worry about if I did it wrong, could of been better should of been that etc etc. (probably because I have some subconscious fear of being rejected as I was in my early life)

I can't small talk, unless I feel good on that day. I ask questions mostly, I ask same questions to different people to get a different information and then make something original or pick and choose the best ones I like, to form my own opinion.

I am social awkward, I often wont talk and just do my thing or listen unless I'm spoken to or else If I feel comfortable with the person. This weird's people out, I am weird , I can see it and I feel it from others. It's hard for me to be extroverted, although sometimes I'm a completely different person, I talk and talk and talk and feel amazing, really engaging.

I don't know if there is something I don't see about myself , there is certainly something weird about me.

I have had depression/ feeling suicidal for a good chunk of my life. I am 25 now, suicidal feeling comes and goes every 2 -3 months as of most recent times.

In essence I want to be useful in this life, I want to be able to help people, I want to help those who are struggling because I can resonate with them so much and often the reasons are trivial but cause disaster in peoples lifes.

I don't know, I don't feel like a sociopath I have certainly some mental problem but I dont feel like I'm at a point where I cant change it for better. I need some clarification because I don't know what to think or do, the person who is probing me ( i looked up to and thought will help me) is playing a a manipulative game and has now influenced many people who know me to think I'm a sociopath.",26Oct2019,1

78,"My boyfriend (30/m) had only friends with benefits and one night stands throughout his whole life and his “body count” is quite high. He expressed early on in our relationship (I am his first real girlfriend) that he was ashamed of his “history.” 

I grew up in a conservative Christian household and thus had very strict “morals,” including saving my virginity for marriage. By my own choice, I left the religion entirely this year, and then met my now boyfriend. His history did make me a bit insecure, as I was a virgin and he had a lot of sexual experience. 

When I did lose my virginity to him and start sleeping with him, he didn’t make me feel an ounce of embarrassment or inferiority. A lot of times, I didn’t know what to do, or it hurt a bit, or I was tense, or I didn’t know how to move. He never made me feel stupid or inexperienced. Instead, he was so tender, loving, reassuring, affirming, positive, passionate and tactful. He made sure I was enjoying it. He always reassured me with words during sex, especially with “I love you.” 

At one point after sex, he told me that he made love to me, and said, “I never made love before because I never loved anyone before.”

Then I was running through the halls, playing, but there came this voice echoing above me that said ""God never gave a **** about you, or anybody else!"" And it didn't bother me at all, I said clear as day- ""That. is. a LIE."" and it dispelled entirely.

Then I went to my own room where I lay down dreaming... but I was hungry, and so I went to the kitchen where there was all this delicious food.. but *then* I saw/remembered the people banging on the doors and windows!

And I was saying oh wait, we have to get ___ inside! And we have to get ___ inside! I can't remember their names or faces but they were *supposed* to come inside.

I finally got a job in mid September that was decent pay with good benefits, but was uneasy because of my lack of experience in a professional office environment.

84,"To clarify, my Mother-in-law specifically.
My wife(24f) had a shitty childhood. Her mom has admitted she was probably not the worst mom, but sure as hell gets no good-mom points. From abusive boyfriends, moving every few months and depending on who you believe an attempted trade for drugs. MIL even left Sperm donor on Valentine's day, leaving with all the furniture the rent and the 6month old. No direct contact for 18yrs. Supposedly there was like 8 months when my Wife was about a 2yo and she was left with spermdonor's 12yo sister and her grandma.... Grandma being spermdonor's step mom? Let's just say her upbringing was complex and tough.
On a regular basis we have mild arguments about trivial shit because ""my mom did it while I was a kid."" And I have to carefully and politely remind her of the time her biological grandfather and the court declared her mom an unfit parent.
I met my Wife roughly the same time she actually met her sperm donor, who is awarded that name because he believes that because he's the biological father she must obey his every whim.... their relationship did not last long... which is a shame because he's a cool guy when he forgets he's a dad.... but he's not the problem.

Mil has a great habit of ""trying to make it up"" to my Wife, even by going put of her way to do things for our 3yo son. I try to be supportive as much as possible... but if mil doesn't know she's on speaker phone she'll legitimately exclude me from the plans. Whatever they maybe. 
Example, I was not invited to the wedding, my son was and she was still pregnant...
 My parents were not invited to my son's birthday party because we're "" different stock."" Sure, my parents are heavily tattooed biker types. ""Stepdad-in-law"" once told me 'your life is like sons of anarchy hahaha' I'll note that the party was at chuck e cheeses. But she was paying for the event and so oh well what can I do? The party ended up being me wondering around following my son while they ate pizza and drank pisswater beer at the table. 15 minutes out of the whole 3 hours my Wife took him to play so I could sit down and eat.... the whole table left with her. I ate half a pizza alone... not worried about eating my feelings bit being the only person at a childs birthday party when you're a 24yo with anxiety and personal space issues... kinda I dunno... makes you feel left out.
They took us to Midevail times for a joint birthday (mil and wife are 2 days apart)... they bought the tickets 3 months in advance. My wife said I was sooo excited I'm such a fantasy and midevail nerd, plus I used to work for a horse ranch, and a theatre company so like all my hobbies in one place and just yay.... MIL responded with ""oh he wanted to go to?"" they bought my ticket at the door... My seat was on the other side of another party. We were able to convince them to trade me seats so I can sit with my group. It was awesome though, super glad yo have been included really grateful for the oppurtunity... but I suspect the only reason they brought me along is my Wife threatened not to go, can't conform it but my Wife has yet to deny it. It was fun oh well.
My parents don't even call to invite me for things either so I guess I'm used to it or just give off that vibe I'm not interested... but they call my Wife and invite the whole family, sometimes in laws included. (We live with/take care of her elderly grandparents)

What's really got me frustrated and upset is this is the third week they've come over to do some work on the house, SDIL is a tradesmen and actually specializes in mobile home repair so he's helping us fix a few issues we have with the house. This is awesome, it's sooo much help and I'm 100% grateful that he's spending his days off to work on my house. He's a great guy, super kind, really funny. Way too good for my mil. He keeps her in check though, before him she was blatantly rude to me and had openly stated if my Wife ever found anyone else shed be much happier. She repeated that statement once, and SDIL took her outside and explained to her that she was rude that was uncalled for and she had no place in the world at all to say something like that to anyone.... She then came back inside and said all of those things to me and apologized. Offering me 50$ to ignore it. I declined, accepted the apology and asked them to leave. SDIL called me the next day to apologize again and Suggested that him and I go fishing. I'm still waiting for that fishing trip but I'm not holding my breath for it.... I'm off track, anyway awesome SDIL is here to work on the house, while the girls go shopping with our son. They all left me at home to go to lunch first and go buy all the supplies to redo our kitchen floor. I'm expected to be the gopher while he's here, cool I'm help. But I'm also expected to keep my mouth shut and stay out of mils way while she's here... like wtf? Iirc this is my house.

85,"But I am disappointed in you.

For one when someone calls you a friend and even a close friend its like giving a gift to someone. You took that gift, beat it up, damaged it, and when you figured out what you were doing with it you decided to give that back to me all damaged. That gift was trust, care, concern, and love. You gave it back in a form of a text saying ""I won't be seeing you anymore"" after a day we had an amazing time. How left field that was?  It hurt me to my core to the point where I couldn't function. I was blaming myself and you said its wasn't my fault, but yet I can't fathom how on earth a friend who was there for you needed to get cut off from your life. 

Secondly, I was there when you needed someone to talk to. When your family was making you feel like shit for your sexuality, needed someone to talk to, who was there? You took so much from me that the friendship felt so one sided after a while. After i vented to people about how you treated me among things they all told me to drop you, but I saw an amazing person blooming after you came out. When I first met you it was like I was meeting someone who was totally different in the way how they talked, saw things and even went about life. I thought you were special. But after a while I saw that I wasn't one of the friends you wanted to be around. You had get together with friends you vented to me about and didn't tell me, but yet I put up with you because again I wanted to be your friend. 

Thirdly, you chase the wrong people for the wrong reasons. You want everyone to like you and get close to, yet when they don't reciprocate you try to reach out further till you get hurt. But instead of focusing on people who do, you throw them to the side like they'll always be there. When you told me one of your friends from college made empty promises to you, what did you do after you distance yourself from them? You went back to them like they never treated you like shit. You said you loved that friend even though they would never say the same for you. But again a friend who put up with your shit gets the boot? 

At the end I am disappointed in your actions, but more so the things you have done to me. When I needed you,  I was left on read, not available, too busy and many more excuses. You were someone who took from me. Fortunately I am no longer stressed. I can finally look forward to making newer friends, but with caution. You taught me that you can know someone for a long time that they'll never have your back no matter what, not overestimate myself in someones life because you can care for them but they won't feel the same for you. Most importantly to not give myself to people so often because people won't appreciate the gift of who I am as person. You taught me to not give a gift of calling someone my friend so freely. 

Even if you do decided to come back into my life it won't be the same as it was. You damaged the gift I gave you and I won't be making the same mistake twice.",26Oct2019,2

I'm trying to work on myself and learn to be happy with myself. I have depression and social anxiety since as long as I can remember, and I'm in therapy which is a (literal) lifesaver but it's slow going. I still hate myself most of the time, which makes it really difficult to get out and meet new people and try and make friends.

I'm trying to join groups and do some volunteering, get outside and get more active. I'm also teaching myself another language and trying to use this alone time to read more and journal, which is helping lift my spirits a little.

But I just feel so cripplingly alone. And I feel like I'm never going to be able to stop hating myself enough to forge any real friendships or have a healthy relationship. My only long-term relationship has crashed and burned largely because of my own self-loathing and insecurity (among other reasons). I have this dream of becoming a better, more confident, well-rounded, emotionally self-sufficient person and loving myself enough to freely love, show up for, and support my ex and we can get back together again. But I know that is incredibly unlikely, and the thought that I've destroyed everything we had and self-sabotaged is devastating.

I don't know if I'll ever be healthy enough to have a committed relationship again, or even to sustain friendships. And my social anxiety tells me I'm not interesting enough and I'm too awkward and sad and moody for anyone to want to be around. Which at the moment feels really true because I keep reaching out to people and they don't reach back. 

I'm trying to better it's just so hard. And it's a Saturday night and I'm home alone feeling sorry for myself because there's no one else I could spend it with and I was too scared to go out to a club or bar alone.

So yeah I guess I just wanted to share this feeling to hopefully feel a little more connected to some other humans, even if only online. Sorry it's so self-pitying. :/ I know one of the things I need to work on improving is whining less lol.",26Oct2019,1

It hurts me, I can't stop him, and he keeps going until we are both done...

I wasn't mad at him, just the situation, and I wanted to talk, but he was so happy after. He kissed me, he thanked me, told me how loved it. Told me how he loved I was into new things, and trying things with me.

I didn't have the heart to tell him I was in agony almost the entire time!

SO I know I will get advice that will say to tell him I didn't like it... I do kinda plan to. But is there anything I can do to also keep this where we can keep doing this? Something like this? I really do not want to take away something he enjoys doing with me!",26Oct2019,2
91,"I hate it. If it’s overly nice I just feel like they are sucking up to me and that they are trying to seek my approval in some sort of way. If it’s normally nice I still don’t like it, I feel like I don’t deserve it and to be honest it makes me hate myself more. It makes me feel like they shouldn’t be nice to me, that they are delusional for being nice to me and if it’s in a romantic way then I definately feel like they aren’t head straight and should know better thus I never feel for anyone nice. The one guy that I loved, treated me like shit tbh, but I realised I loved it (not being treated like shit) but the sense of seeking acknowledgment / approval, I know that sounds messed up but it’s true. Honestly I think my thinking is really toxic so any opinions, advice or similar situations if anyone’s expirienced would be appreciated. Thanks guys.",26Oct2019,3
92,"I don't want to kill myself, but my life hurts so bad that I imagine that one day it wouldn't be too bad if I don't wake up from my night's sleep. My daily life kills me. I have no one to talk to or share what I feel. The only one person I had in my life says she needs to figure out herself first and that she has lost herself as a person and needs time. 

I just don't feel I'll ever be happy. Might as well be dead suddenly.",26Oct2019,5
93,"This is my first post and I'm just figuring out how discussions work.  This is going to be kinda all over the place.

Life has been pretty freaking great these past couple months.  I was very depressed and lonely for about 2 years and struggling with a lot family problems and my sexuality.  Just graduated high school as well and I was super scared of the future.  I have a great job, I'm going to school full time and see friends and have a pretty good social life.  But there's nights where I just think is this real?  It kind of scares me how life has just been rolling like a breeze and I can't seem to accept it. 

I have stayed of marijuana for a couple months now, I don't miss it at all but I've been drinking.  Just at parties, I use to smoke so much.  I go through phrases with things where I think it makes me happy but it doesn't.  I love drinking, because I talk more and just get loose.  What irritates me is that some of my friends think I get addictive to things for a while and find something new.  I could see why but isn't that everyone?  We all find something new.

Also I have been single for about 6 years now and never really talked to anyone throughout middle school and high-school like that.  I had mini crushes and I knew people liked me but I just didn't seem to care.  My choice.  But I really just want someone to be there for me and actually generally care for me.  I just can't seem to find that but I do know not to depend on someone else for my happiness.

I just don't know what I want to do with my life, my love life is boring and I guess everything else is good but I actually don't know what I want to do in the future.  Failure runs in the family and sometimes I think it's okay to not do anything because it runs in the family and who cares right?  High school was so terrible nobody really expected anything from me so I just didn't care about a lot of things.  I just don't know what I want for myself and I know I'm still young, but I just went through the adult life pretty young and see the real world.",26Oct2019,2

96,"I know I need to talk to someone professional about my issues but I find that there's a mental block that stops me, like a wall I can't break.

Also doesn't help that identifying my own emotions/feelings goes as far as being happy, sad, tired and pissed. Anything more complex than that, I can't pinpoint or I don't know what it is I'm feeling.
I think I just chalk it up to being really tense and my heart hurting/aching. 

I wanna try a ""new year, new me"" thing next year and make this as something to work on so I don't look like an idiot when I try and talk to someone about my issues. 

Any ideas on how to get over this damned wall??",26Oct2019,1
97,"I have so much debt that I literally barely have enough money to live after paying it all. The only thing I can think that I've heard can be reduced is medical debt. I can't pay it, at least not for like 2+ years.

102,I’m in therapy right now and I just wanna be done with the pain. My therapist says I should love myself first but that’s hard when I put myself through hell. The thought of being alone is irritating me because I eat alone I travel and I do everything alone. I think therapy was a good start but I’m so stubborn that I’m afraid about getting better. He said to write a letter to myself and I can’t think of anything nice to say depression has made me so bitter and miserable.😔,26Oct2019,1
103,Family got rid of me years ago. Abusive s/o shut me down and shut out everyone. Spent years homeless. I feel so fucking empty. Like I don't have anything that actually matters. I've been struggling for a long time and don't have anyone I can really talk to and ask for help. Just alone. Dunno if this is an okay place to post this or not. I'm just fading away and no one cares or notices and I mean I don't blame anyone but it still is breaking my heart. Just need to... Idk. Sorry,26Oct2019,2

105,"I finally hate someone.. and it sucks. I have disliked or thought others were annoying, but I never hated anyone before. I tried so hard to empathize and understand and cater to their needs but it wasn’t enough. And when I got to my breaking point, it was still my fault that I broke. They took my friends, my reputation, and my job away from me and I still didn’t hate them. But now, they’re taking it too far and I can’t help myself. I don’t want to. Hating people just makes you feel negatively inside but I can’t help it, I’m done.  They’re letting their pride get in the way and can’t put our differences aside for other people.

Not that big of a problem when I go out to the mall but I thrift to save money and I'm like will this fit me? Maybe not I should size up to be safe and it turns out it's way too big on me.",26Oct2019,1
