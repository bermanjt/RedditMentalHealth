0,"So i’ve been dating this guy on and off for about 3 years now (i’m in hight school btw) and after a heated arguments about my meds,y mom just screamed that (insert name) is gay and doesn’t really like me. I was pissed to say the least, but also didn’t know what to say. I know he’s not gay, and most of the reasons are... well... not ones i want to tell my mom to say the least ;). But not only that, she continued on by saying that he only asked me to
go to prom with him so he could cover up. That sent me over the edge. I’ve never been good with people in general, and I was so excited to be asked to prom and get to go, and sort of face my fear of any and all social interactions. My mom knows I never thought I’d be stable (mentally) enough to go to prom, and she knows she really got me where it hurts. That night, I wrote a long note and painted something for my mom apologizing for the other stuff I said. In the morning she cried and hugged me and said it was the best apology ever. But that was all she said. No sorry. I left it. But then, after taking the mail out, she asked me whether I had broken up with (insert name) yet. I obviously said no, and she was like, god, you can’t just date a gay guy! And she said, oh, he didn’t even invite your to hang out last night. He obviously doesn’t actually want to be near you. I cried and went to my room. Where I’ve been ever since. I don’t know what to do anymore. I literally just don’t. Sorry this was so long I just, like, need advice? Ugh. :(",01Apr2019,2
1,"He has never been to college so he doesn’t understand that it’s not easy to graduate on time. I took an extra two years because I couldn’t handle the pressure that was put on me by my family (ironically) and ended up dropping most of my courses or failing. I’m really not proud of this, but it’s in the past and my dad won’t let it go. I’m finally graduating in a month. I just over heard him talking with my mom “wow it’s taking her five years to graduate she wasted so much time could’ve been finished already”. That broke my heart to hear. He doesn’t even understand what I went through and he doesn’t realize I can’t undo any of this. I don’t understand what the point of having that kind of outlook is??? It’s not going to change the past and it’s not like I don’t realize I’ve made mistakes. Not being able to graduate on time is so painful to me, I feel so guilty about it for so many reasons, and he hit the most raw nerve of mine. I could never even tell him, because he just wouldn’t understand. He laughed about it too - about the fact that I’m still in school after all these years. 

I don’t want him at my graduation. ",01Apr2019,12

3,"I've lived 23 years (identify as transage, so I'm not ""actually"" 23 as far as my mind and identity go, but that's a whole other story), and even just thinking back 10 years seems like a lifetime ago–some extremely distant memory. I try to put myself in the shoes of older people and try to imagine what they must think of decades past, like the 70s and before. How can they even remember that long ago??? I think back to some of my earliest memories, which probably were around 20 years ago, and that seems like some totally different dimension. How can people think back even *double* or *triple* that amount of time?

It's all so mind boggling. To you people that have lived that long, does it really feel like another lifetime ago, or do things kind of start to slow down as you get older?",01Apr2019,0

5,Starting this week I am changing my outlook on a lot of things. I went through a really rough couple of weeks recently (break up and other personal issues) and I really want to start working on myself and doing things that make me a better person both mentally and physically. Here are my goals/game plan. I’m going to actually start working out and eating right to make sure I can build myself a body I am comfortable to look at. I will take things one day at a time and make sure to always put forth my best effort at everything. I want to make sure I reach out to the people that I normally don’t reach out to to make sure they are doing ok and to make sure they know how much I appreciate them. I’m going to finish this semester strong and I am going to make myself proud. I want to make myself proud of me and I want to excel at everything I do. I will reflect on myself often and try not to make the same mistakes twice. This all won’t happen overnight and I know I may mess up but this is the start of a new me and I’m excited. ,01Apr2019,28
6,"I am young, and come from a very broken home with a manipulative mother, a psychotic stepmother and a passive dad. A lot of things have happened to me throughout the years and I’ve endured it, but my friends have told me they don’t know how to react when I’m sad because its 10 times what they are dealing with which honestly feels like the truth. Kids my age are worrying about college and hook ups when I’m worrying about running away, getting kicked out, my plethora of family issues or not killing myself. 

People say don’t bottle it in but i feel as if none of my friends are ready to ever handle me at my worst. My bad days are psychologically enduring and theirs are “my coworker pissed me off” or “my boyfriend did something that made me upset”. Mine is “oh my parent verbally abused me again! Completely ruined my self worth and screamed at me for an hour but thats cool!”

10,My parents split up back in November and things got really rough. I fell back into depression hard as I’m finishing my senior year.

11,"I grew up in a rough neighbourhood and seen A LOT. I don’t want to go into depth, but i was recently thinking everyone that was my “role model” isn’t much of a role mode. Most people I grew up with are in jail , dead, down the wrong path in life. 

Im on my way to getting a PhD in psychology soon. (Inshallah), but I’m just paranoid. So much death. The concept of mortality was forced upon from a young age without a warning. I feel like a lot of my childhood Innocence was taken away from me because of the things I went through, the things I saw and the things I heard. 

Idk what I really want as answer. But this life is crazy, it’s so short. Who knows whats next? If anything? I have faith but only because I want to believe i can be re united with my loved ones sooner or later. 

The last time I saw them surely can’t be it. Right?

One moment you are here the next moment you are gone.. but you are gone forever. Never get to hear their voice again or touch them. 

Please be kind...this life is very short. This can be anyone’s last interaction with you.

Fast forward a little bit, M and I fell out (I forget why) and then I heard she got back into a relationship... with her ex. 


Kind of left me speechless. Moving on past M, I had a really shitty couple of years. I was dating this guy that I knew I never wanted to marry. That relationship left me messed up.

16,"I never tell this story. It's a crazy story, but absolutely true. I won't tell it to anybody in real life, or even on my real Reddit account. I won't tell it to Hannah, who inspired it. Not to any friends. So I'm telling it here.

I am a 22 year old geek.

Last year I was a 21 year old, glasses-wearing geek who was a senior in college with nearly a 4.0 GPA. And I'm still (blush) admittedly a virgin. I'm only about 5'7, a ""studies-while-eating Doritos"" belly on an otherwise normal frame.

I told my friend Hannah about how I like to wake up very early on some days and head to the local nature preserve before class. I'm always alone, and it's beautiful.

She told me that her and her boyfriend used to go, and sometimes, she would strip to the nude.

My eyes bulged. She giggled and said it was not sexual at all. It allowed her to be ""one with nature"".

She said ""You should try it sometime, if you ever got the balls. Literally haha"".

Yeah right. I never even take my shirt off at the beach.

Then, one Tuesday morning at 6:30 am on a bright, sunny, only slightly brisk early Spring Tuesday morning...I got the itch.

I don't EVER do anything out of character. Why not just try it out? Nobody will ever know.

I actually undressed. I took off my heavy boots and long socks. My sweater. My pants. My undershirt.

There I was, shivering (it wasn't THAT cold, just a tad chilly, but the nerves got to me) in nothing but my light blue boxers.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and slid them down and kicked them off into the pile.

Now, clad in only my glasses and as bare as a newborn baby, I cupped my package with my hands, and I timidly walked towards the lake, about 50 yards from where I left my clothes, and I looked up at the gorgeous view.

The trees. The mountains. The beautiful, clear, blue lake.

Without even thinking, I placed my hands at my sides.

And there I was. Martin the virgin geek.

Naked.

Buck naked, in fact.

More naked than the trees, which were ""clothed"" in leaves.

More naked than Adam in the Garden of Eden, who at least had a fig leaf.

I was exposed. Not just physically, but exposed to new excitement and beauty.

Inspired, I even walked around the entire lake, as naked as the day I was born.

My round, bare belly shaking. My white-as-a-ghost ""bubble butt"" that Hannah would also make me blush over that she said I was always ""hiding"" under my nerdy khakis jiggling behind me. And my small package (hey, it's a throwaway!) bobbing in the brisk air.

I walked around the entire lake.

The crisp breeze occasionally startling me by caressing my bare butt. The tickle of a few flowers on my belly and package as I walked. The feel of the fresh grass through my bare feet as I walked.

Standing there, basking in the view, it was then that I heard it.

""Beautiful, simply beautiful.""

It was a woman. About 43 years old. Pretty, with a slight hard-to-pinpoint foreign accent.

She had a GIGANTIC, expensive, HD camera. And directly taking photos - OF ME!!!

I stood there frozen in shock, eyes wide, mouth open, as naked as a newborn baby with my hands at my sides in the bright sunshine for about 5 full seconds.

Then in a panic, I cupped my package with my hands and I ran behind a tree as she giggled and kept snapping photos of the scenery.

I poked my head out from behind the large tree, hiding my vulnerable, naked body behind it, with the now colder breeze attacking my bald, defenseless white buttcheeks behind me.

""You can't take those pictures!""

She said ""I sure can, sweetie. We're out in a public space. Nobody forced you to go traipsing around in your birthday suit.""

I replied: ""You can't share those photos!!""

She said ""Relax, and don't be so embarrassed. I've seen many men in the nude over the years. I'm no virgin here.""

That made me blush beat red.

She said ""For ruining my carefully planned shoot, I'm going to use these photos to create a painting.""

As I spoke up, I felt my naked, white butt-cheeks jiggling as I was shaking in panic and anger.

I said: ""A painting?! Of what?"" as I clung desperately to the tree shielding my body from her gaze.

She smirked. ""A painting showcasing true bravery and vulnerability.""

I said ""I'm no model for a painting.""

She replied: ""Oh, but you are, nude boy. It's one thing for some confident, viking man to walk around here. You're not one of those types, with some big, silly penis flopping around to show off.""

I subconsciously placed a single hand over my package, even from behind the tree.

She said: ""But you. You're the true picture of vulnerability. Your lily-white skin. Your adorable chubby belly. A hint of a bosom on you, even with hard nipples in the cool air.""

She giggled. And I subconsciously used my other hand to hide my nipples like a damsel in distress.

""And your little penis exposed for the world to see. Standing fearlessly, without cover, in the open. Clothed by nothing but your smattering of body hair, and a slight, endearing pink blush across your cheeks. I'm going to paint you.""

My ""pink"" blush turning RED as I cried: ""But you can't!!""

She said ""I can, and I will. Google me."" She gave me her name.

""Your bare body will be in my gallery in a few months.""

Defeated, I said ""Well I'm going back around the lake, the least you can do is give my dignity and avert your eyes.""

She said ""I'll do no such thing. I have more photos to take. Now go run along, naked boy. Get that cute tushie running around the lake and get dressed, it's getting cold.""

As I ran around the entire lake, with absolutely no cover, feeling my bubble butt literally shaking behind me, I turned to see her unflinchingly smirking and staring at me. And even snapping a few more final photos.

A few months later, I did Google her, and sure enough, there I was.

A sight that a girl had never seen before, my naked body. It was expertly painted I must say, with unfortunately exquisite detail. A lush greenery set against beautiful mountains, with my blushing, eyes wide, mouth open, naked spectacle, arms at my sides, standing in front. My blushing face. My rounded, never-hit-the-gym belly. And there is my small penis and balls prominently displayed clearly for the world to see.

With 2,000 favorites on her website. She displayed it in a gallery. It was sold for $5,600.

And it hangs right in the lobby of my town's city hall. Amazingly, nobody has noticed it's me. Or, they are too embarrassed to tell me...

About 2 years later (now) I'm going to a new physiotherapist who specializes in these sorts of injuries .

Another thing is I'm not sure about my career choice . I want to envision myself as a teacher but I can't stand being indoors all day .

31,"The title says it all, I made a quite a significant amount of money by selling pictures and videos of my feet to people on the internet.

One evening a video popped up in my YouTube suggestions of a girl who I had done the same thing and my initial reaction was why would anyone pay for a picture of my feet. Curious as to whether this was legit or not, I made my Instagram account at 1 in the morning and started posting picture of my feet in various poses with hashtags such as #footfetishnation #footporn etc...I went to sleep and the next day I woke up to 100 followers. Initially I didn’t want to do this behind my boyfriends back, so I mentioned to him this funny video I had watched.. he laughed but said.. don’t do it it’s not moral... but I thought what the heck it’s only pictures of my feet, it’s not that bad?!

I then made a reddit account and posted here, this got me the most followers who were also directed to my Instagram. I made a tinder account for my feet, a kik account and a new pay pal. I was ready to go.

It was slow at first and I would get bombarded with messages from perverts but eventually I had my first paying customer the same week. They requested that I film myself tickling my feet with a hair brush and then electric toothbrush.. I didn’t really know how my reaction was supposed to be so I did a cross between an awkward laugh and quiet moaning. It was an easy £35. I decided to up my game a bit, so many girls were doing this and it was easy to take any old picture of your feet. I set up my camera, leaning against a bin in my bedroom and facing a bare white wall. I put on different outfits, different lipsticks to match my nails and did artistic poses. This was great, the pictures turned out great and the reaction was great. 

People were requesting more and more videos and I was starting to get a fan base, the same people coming back for picture sets and different videos. Some people were messaging me and wanting to talk, it felt like I had made friends...

I would be all day on my phone in my real life job, responding to comments, taking orders, replying to messages, it was a full time job. I would rush home from work and run up stairs to take more pictures, the rush was quick money was addictive.

Within one week I had reach 800 followers on my Instagram, around 200 of those were paying customers. I had 1500 followers on reddit and £400 in my PayPal account. All without my work colleagues, family and more importantly my boyfriend knowing.

The requests started coming more and more sexual and I suddenly realised that even though the video of my rubbing oil on my feet or taking off my heels felt pretty innocent to me, these men were jerking off over it and I was effectively making porn. 

One night I suddenly decided this wasn’t right, I deleted all my accounts without saying a word to my followers and decided to stop.

Weirdly I kind of miss doing this, I had created some really nice pictures and met some cool people. I had created a little character for myself, Elena from Russia who was now living in the UK. It was fun to be someone different and even more fun doing this while no one knew.

37,"This is pretty long, I apologize in advance. But, without further ado...

So I've (16F) had this crush on this (18M) for about a year. 

We met in a guitar class, at first it was only standing behind each other in line, asking for a pencil, small stuff. Eventually, I started talking to him more, waving during passing periods, walking him to class, making jokes and puns just for shits and giggles. I used to write him little notes with positive sayings and give them to him. At one point or another, a friend I made in that class tagged me in a post and he sent a friend request, I accepted, yadda yadda yadda.

He texted me, and told me he'd been searching for my account for a long time. Later on, at about four in the morning, he texted me these huge paragraphs about how crappy his life had been, things of that nature. I ended up regularly giving him advice on how to handle certain things, and we exchanged our perspective of life and the universe, stuff like that. I knew his entire life story and he knew mine.

He was a refreshing change of the childish, immature boys that hunted me down my first years of high school. I felt like we understood each other, and I felt truly at peace whenever we talked. He made me feel loved and I felt ecstatic every time we were together.

I told my friend (now ex-boyfriend) at the time how happy I felt, even if we were just friends. I was just a mere sophomore at the time; he was a junior, but because of some credits that transferred incorrectly from other states, he was held back a year. My ""friend"" said he wasn't worth the chase, that he was just trying to get in my pants and he'd leave me as soon as he graduated.

Turns out, he did like me. We agreed on a date, nothing too big, just spending time with each other. I liked him too, but I told him that he didn't really like me, that it was just a phase. I told him I wasn't any good for him, and that he needed someone else. Worst decision I've ever made.

I shattered my own heart, knowing that I made him feel sad. He said it was alright. 

Fast forward a couple months, I had to sit through that damn class, watching some girl cuddle up to him as if I meant nothing. Pretty typical. But note that he hardly paid attention to her. I ended up dating my ""friend,"" who I broke up with for being an extremely toxic and controlling person. His girlfriend at the time didn't like me, so she forced him to cut off all contact with me. 

About last year in late November, early December, (once I knew they'd broken up for sure) I texted him. I told him I was sorry for our falling out last year, and that I wanted to reinstate a better friendship. He agreed, and we talked as if nothing ever happened. 

We're still friends, but since he works late and is graduating in May, he's a bit too busy for the girl who's head over heels for him. Every month, we do ""wellness checks,"" where we tell each other how we've been feeling and our current mental state. He's been lacking lately so I picked up a month, but he did one last week, and I can't even describe how oddly satisfying it was for him to ask me how I was and genuinely express his concern.

Two boyfriends later, and I still like him. I'm going as far as to call him my first love, as naive as it may sound. But he's completely over me, not to mention he turns 19 this year. I don't know if I should tell him I still hold genuine feelings for him, or just cheer from the sidelines while he travels the country and goes on with life.

Regardless of the outcome, I just wanted to get this off my chest. Thank you to whoever read, have a nice day/night! :)",01Apr2019,3
38,"I don’t have anyone to tell so I’ll just vent here. 
I’ve lived my entire life more or less separated from the very few people who have ever loved me. Growing up I only got to spend a month or two with my father in the summers, otherwise I lived with my abusive alcoholic mother and her string of dirtbag boy friends, who either also abused me or sexual assaulted me. 

That quickly led to a large amount of time spent away from home growing up and that in turn led to drug abuse which got me into a lot of violent situations. Before I was 17 I had been shot, stabbed, nearly blown up, and sorta set on fire, broken every limb and most ribs atleast once, I had more concussions than I care to admit, and had to have my heart restarted on 3 separate occasions. We moved around a lot and otherwise of older stoner kids I never bothered to get to know anyone. The first young woman I ever developed feelings for also turned into a long distance relationship after one of the last moves and before I entered the service after getting myself clean at 17. After five years she didn’t love me anymore and couldn’t handle seeing me just once a year. I can’t really blame her but it hurt. I developed feelings for another young woman who I was serving with and we started dating however she left the service before I did and as such it turned again into a long distance relationship again seeing each other once a year, and we got married 14 months ago. I just spent a month with her and it will be another 5 months at the least before we are able to see each other again. 

I don’t form bonds with people. Not that I actively try to avoid doing so, I just don’t naturally. I feel so fucking tired so goddamn always. I guess in a way I feel entitled to something I can’t have. 

Peace. Love. Rest. 

Genuine love from one of the few people on this earth I actually value and have formed a bond with...not just for a while once a year. But to come home at the end of the day and see them. To have a normal life. That’s all I’ve ever wanted.

True peace and rest....I feel like I’ve survived enough already. I don’t pray for death anymore. Though having walked the line enough by 23, I would welcome it. 

Sorry I think it’s just my depression getting the better of me right now and needed to vent.

Based on my research for overcoming procrastination, I have found the most powerful technique there is - at least for me, anyway. Want to know what that is? It's doing more of what scares me. It's doing more of what makes me feel vulnerable. Simply put, it's taking action, taking action in the face of adversity.

This is what I have found works best for me. Here is some good content on overcoming procrastination.

41,I was playing my PS4 with my gf watching as she usually does and I was partially drunk. As I was playing I had this sudden existential crisis basically and I just started getting upset about dying and how I won’t be alive to have a family and she was comforted me as I was being ridiculous. I think that fear is natural for me and me being under the influence just brought the truth out. I appreciate her for hugging me and telling me things are okay right now.,01Apr2019,1
43,"I used to be pretty dependent on weed, I would smoke all the time, I sold, I made edibles etc. etc. it really consumed my life. After graduating college I left the country for six months and while I was away I didn’t seek out weed at all. I was really proud of myself for that. When I got back to the US, I relapsed a little. Then sometime in August I got too high, which, among other factors, triggered me falling into a deep depressive episode that lasted about a month. I was suicidal. Since then I have only smoked weed one time, back in January and I only took a couple puffs from a shared joint. I’m really really proud of myself for kicking the habit. Recently I applied to a job, and in the description it stated that candidates will be drug tested. I immediately felt anxiety, but then quickly realized I have nothing to worry about because for the first time in about 6 years I am totally clean. Hallelujah ",01Apr2019,82
44,"I(24M) started dating a girl(27) I met on Tinder.  Everything started off great as I suspected because of the quality of our match.  There was almost nothing we disagreed on and were more compatible than I had ever been with anyone.  We chatted for about 3 months when she reveals that she has a daughter who is only 4 months old. I tell her that it's awesome and that I've always wanted kids and had no problem with it.  A month goes buy and pieces start to fall into place and she asks me if I would like to move in with them.  No pressure, but I had never done anything like that.  I start asking around and apparently it's a bad idea, but what do they know, I'm falling in love.  My only worry was that it was a trap and she had a crazy side and wanted to hurry up and settle and I was convenient, so I declined and said I'd wait a bit to give her an answer and get my duck in a row before I pull the trigger. 

A month goes by and I'm moving in.  I was still slightly wary of her because of the whole situation and everything had seemed perfect thus far.  I'm more comfortable with her daughter who is now growing and she started to grow on me, was this her plan? Was I right?  The first month goes by and everything was bliss.  Where were all these problems and stuff everyone warned me about? 3 more months pass. No fighting, no yelling, and I'm positive I've found my life partner.  She is everything I had ever wanted and the little girl's 1st birthday is fast approaching.

Here is where the foundation of the relationship starts to crack.  When I moved in, all I had was my love for her, my money, my vehicle and clothing.  I gave up everything to live with her, including my job, but I didn't care, this was the woman I wanted to marry some day.  I had worked the same job all my life on a farm, and went from that to sitting around the house for almost 2 months.  I didn't know it , but i had fallen into a rut and was depressed.  The bills were paid, but my cleaning efforts slowly started to dwindle and she was a single mother with no time to pick up my slack.  I was glued to my computer screen all day waiting for her to come home so I could be happy and didn't even realize it.  Her entire day was dropping her daughter off at daycare by 7 , going to work by 8, and then picking her up by 4(She didn't want to give me those responsibilities even though I offered many times) so she just assumed that I was being lazy.

She starts to love me less without realizing it.  Sex stopped, and then physical contact, but it was too late, I had already let my anxiety and depression take full control of me and moved out.  One week later I break up with her through a text message.  I talk to a close friend and realize that I have been completely spiraling downward.  I message her saying that I was sorry for what I had done.  I was sorry for abandoning them.  I had cried and still do everyday since we broke up.  I started going to therapy to fix my head and get back to where I was and that I'm working on becoming the man I was when we met and that wasn't me.  She says that I hurt her and she needs to think about things.  She says she can't be with a man that gives up when things get hard. I swear on everything that that is not the man I am.

Before I started going to therapy, I had broken up with her twice and begged for her to take me back.  How pathetic is that? Even now i have no idea why I did and said those things.  That is not the man I am and never knew I was capable of losing that much control.  My therapist assures me that there are ""plenty of fish in the sea"" over and over and over again and tells me that anxiety coupled with depression can make us think a certain way and act accordingly and impulsively.  She doesn't understand that I caught the best fish and there will never be another like this one. Never.  She asks me if I'm suicidal, but I'd be a fool to end any chance I have at getting her back.  I love being alive more than that.

Today marks a little over a month that I ruined the best thing that has happened to me. Even though she messages me back every few days I feel that she has made up her mind.  I raised a child and loved a woman that I'll never get see again.  I fed her and rocked her to sleep many nights.  I watched her walk for the first time.  I heard her say my name when we were outside naming all the colors and the animals.  I miss spelling words with the letters while giving her a bath. I miss holding the first woman that made me feel alive and showed me what true love was.  I was mentally weak and hate myself.  I can no longer enjoy my once favorite things.  Games don't feel the same because they had a hand in ruining my relationship.  When I'm getting groceries I break down because my little girl isn't in the basket and my love isn't asking me what I want to cook with her.

I doubt many people will read all of this and that's fine.  I just needed to put it all somewhere.",01Apr2019,11
45,"Back in January, I spent a few hours going through old pictures. The “ten year challenge” took the internet by storm, and everyone posted happy pictures. Most of them had the feeling of “we were so young and happy, and now I’m older and even happier.”

My pictures looked a bit different, so I never posted anything. I did however realize something. Almost ten years had passed since I made a decision. A difficult, almost impossible, decision. I decided to give life one more try. Just one more try, then I’d be allowed to stop living. If I could give it an honest try, and truly give it my everything, then I would be allowed to quit. I could die, and no one could blame me because I would have truly given it everything I had.

So ten years ago I stopped hurting myself. I didn't want to but I had to, in order to truly try. Because if I had to live, it had to be **me**. No therapist, no self-harm, no methods to hide behind. No escape.

I’m gonna be honest with you, Reddit. It was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever done. The first week was like a physical addiction being broken. I remember constantly keeping busy with my hands, always typing or fidgeting with a pen. I missed it so much. I used to have this one song that I always listened to when hurting myself. I couldn’t listen to it for years afterwards. I felt so empty. Thankfully the worst ache went away after a week, and I started taking small steps towards a different kind of life.

It wasn’t easy. It still isn’t easy, sometimes. I started over, and I broke. I started over again, and again and again. But for each new start, I took another step towards the amazing life that I live today. I moved to different cities. I started new jobs, and I quit them. I took a couple of classes. I met new people and I learned how to talk to them. Sometimes I wanted to hurt myself again, but I resisted. I still resist, on the rare occasion that the urge comes. I love my life too much to ever go back to my old ways.

Two months ago was one of those rare occasions. I lost my grandmother, who has always been one of the most important persons in my life. I know she saw my scars back then. I know she was happy when I stopped. So today I want to make myself a new promise: I will never cut again. It has been ten years since I stopped, and for every year that passes I will keep increasing that number. Not just for my grandmother, but for everything she taught me: that I am worthy of a good life. That I deserve to love myself. That my happiness is a choice. I've spent the past ten years learning that she was right. I swear I won't forget it now either.

Thank you to anyone who read this. I just needed to get it out. It has been a long journey, but I am so so glad I made it.",01Apr2019,7
46,"Hey r/self been a lurker here for a while. Guess it’s time to finally post. This might be the wrong place to post but I couldn’t find/think of a better place. Might be a long post so bare with me. 

So I l recently got out of a relationship of 4 years in late Janurary. To summarize, she wanted marriage and kids like now and I really didn’t and wasn’t sure if it was something I wanted. To add to that fact, she made me her everything and I just wasn’t ready to be that,  along with the aching urge to want to see other people. So I ended it amicably with her. 

So I downloaded the dating apps and started my swiping. I ended up matching with a girl who was downright drop dead out of my league gorgeous so instantly moved her to the top of the list. Went on a few dates and honestly if it wasn’t for the physical attraction the connection is a 4/10 at best. None the less I’ve put her on a golden pedestal ( cuz of her beauty) even though I’m still going on dates via tinder and bumble. 

Lemme prefix this next part with the fact that, I am the type of person who is strongly guided by emotion/intuition although I usually react with common sense. 

Me and this girl usually talk regularly through the day. Exchange various forms of texts, video and pics as the day goes by. So naturally I feel like if nothing else, we’re into eachother if we’re doing that. Well I sent her a snap in the late afternoon yesterday. No response. No biggie. She posts a story riding shotgun somewhere on the highway. Still no biggie. She posts a snap of some in person art. No biggie. Hours pass, my shift ends. Still no response. K I guess in the morning we’ll talk. I wake up in the middle of the night with a feeling of uneasy in my stomach. My intuition is telling me something ain’t right about the situation. I do some snooping and low and behold I find out she was in a neighboring city which is known for art exhibitions. I put two and two together along with her demeanor and realize she must have gone on a date and been ignoring me the whole time.

The whole thing has me feeling inadequate. As if I’m not enough. My mind is telling me I’m bat shit crazy while my heart is telling me I’m making a whole lot of sense. The whole kicker to this is that, I myself am doing the same exact thing here. I’m going on dates without telling her, Im purposefully being vague when we discuss what we are doing with our spare time and I’m having fun. I feel like then man operating the way I do. I feel like I don’t have a duty to answer to anybody except myself and my happiness. And I realize, well shit she’s in the same boat. She doesn’t have any responsibility to tell me shit even though I FEEL as though she should.

But Why do I feel like I’m being played even though we never agreed to be exclusive. Why do I feel like I’m not enough for her specifically even though I know I’m a catch to anybody who I date? Why do I feel as though I’m here for somebodies enjoyment even though I feel like I should be the center of their world. Why am I not the center of her world even though she’s not the center of mine? Am I foolish and a by product of my ego or do I have a validnsay in this. Is this what dating is like now? Sucking up all you can from somebody and moving on? Am I dating too soon? I’m trying to work on myself but is playing these games polluting my growth ? 

For one, I feel like I’m out of my mind but at the same time, everything makes sense to me. Can somebody make sense of all of this for me or am I spot on with what I’ve said ? Any other comments are absolutely welcome. Would love to have a conversation about growth as it relates to this.

47,"I have friends that I consider very lazy, but they are doing better in life than me.

&amp;#x200B;

For example: you hardly can get them to read a message you wrote if it consists out of more than 1 or 2 lines of text.

After their workday has finished they basically just lay on the couch and watch netflix all day long or they play computer games. Believe me they don't have a stressful life. They work a mentally easy job that isn't hard physically too and on top of that they don't have to work much while they get paid considerably well.

&amp;#x200B;

They barely get fired and if this situation unfortunately occurs, they have no worries because it doesn't take them long to find a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

Me on the other hand, I'm not very diligent too but I'm trying at least. I have huge troubles to even get out of bed, I don't have motivation at all. I try self improving techniques all the time but I can't stick to it for more than 3 or 4 days. It's a pain in the ass but other than that I'm still harder working than my friends, although I wish I was even harder working.

&amp;#x200B;

(I'm from Europe so my curriculum vitae may differ from that of you.) I finished my 10 year basic education after 11 years and tried to find a job, but didn't get one. The ones who rejected my job applications just treated me like a retarded low level human being and made fun of me behind my back. So there was no more to do other than to swallow this hard pill. Then I had to pay for a 2 year apprenticeship that I finished after 3. Because I had still no luck at the job market after that period I decided to change the field what meant another 2 years of non-paid educational apprenticeship. But the horrible disaster continued: I didn't find a job after what AS WELL so I went to a 1 year training to get a license to apply to college. So now I'm here finishing my 3 year degree after 4 years. I have a real hard time here because for me it seems the other students are able to learn much faster than me.

&amp;#x200B;

The funny part is that even if I manage to find a job, my bachelors-degree won't be considered of major value without any work experience. So I have to start somewhere on a trainee level with low payment at first and that means at the same time that my education is worthless because my friends in low qualification fields are still going to earn more money and already earned money all time WHILE I studied. That sucks. I want to be the best",01Apr2019,2
48,"Alright so a friend of mine and his girlfriend decided to visit a very niche shop on the far side of town.  It sold lightbulbs, but here's the catch: they were artsy lightbulbs, so much that when you plugged it in a socket and turned it on the room would be lit up we a whole lotta vivid colors.  Some lightbulbs actually had pictures drawn into them, which is pretty cool.

So they go around the shop looking at bulbs and the girlfriend finds one she really likes.  The shop has a lightbulb socket at the front counter where customers get to sample the bulb they chose to see if they really like it or not so they went up there to check it out.

The lady at the front screws it on for them, and - voila - the shop lights up and there are kaleidoscope patterns everywhere.  The girlfriend really likes it so they go ahead and pay for it, but before anything else, the phone rings and the lady at the counter has to answer it (this is her personal shop, by the way; she's the only one who works here)

But while she's away on the phone, the girlfriend suddenly just grabs the counter and mashes her face into the bulb.  My friend is used to this kind of behavior, because that's typically how his girlfriend is, but it kinda unnerves him, because 1) they haven't even paid for the bulb yet and she's rubbing her face into it and 2) the lightbulb has been on for so long it's starting to heat up.  He said he could see it on her face; she's trying to resist the pain, but she's clearly making an effort to keep her face pressed on the bulb.

So my friend isn't really sure what to ask his girlfriend, but all of the sudden the girlfriend just says ""Hey Jake (that's a fake name by the way) I don't feel so good.""

And then Jake just says ""I mean you're pushing your face against a hot lightbulb, I don't know what you expected out of that--""

52,"Hello everyone,

I am depressed. I have gone through a break up that had to happen for my girlfriend for her future. It's rough enough but I'm so happy that the relationship happened as it brought hope into my life. Not in anyway saying hope is gone, in many ways hope for a future even better is happening in my heart. I feel alive, I feel human. Fuck its tough to be human though haha. A lot of good memories and there were some though times but we had compassion and patience for each other.

During and after I have learned a lot of things. Mostly that we are all the same. Innate and spiritually wanting to be part of something special with a tribe of our own. To have food, shelter, water, sex, community  and peace with ourselves and one another. I see myself in others because we all have the same feeling, anxiety, depression and trauma but we carry on knowing we can be whole. 

When my last break up happened I did the usual drinking and essentially coping with destructive behaviours to myself. It was awful. Thankfully this time my environment is alot better and my perspective. Maturity and life experience will do that. I have learned to love myself faults and all and beginning to come to terms with existence. I have only one life and I could be closed and get hurt or I could be open, still get hurt but allow love to enter. 

At this moment I am drinking, not because I want to drown my sorrows but to allow myself to feel bad. Its weird because I have not wanted to do it in a while. There was a trigger earlier, one of her favorite songs and it played in the back of my mind but writing this all down makes me feel good.

I am doing a lot of the good things for myself and self care. Contact with family, friends, counsellor, doing exercise, meditation, eating well, college and work, all I love. Sometimes I just want to feel like this.......its human to feel shitty, its human to be anyway at all. I am with myself now. My internal dialogue and feelings are better, just not the best but there is plenty of time to recover.

Thanks for reading and just to let you know we have power to change our reality. Perspective is everything and if you ever feel lonely just know everyone is with you. Its part of being human in society but don't let youself hold you back from feeling good about life. I love myself and I want to love you guys too because I'm sure you are great. Please try be easy with yourselves because life is difficult enough ok.

Hopefully I'll see you all sometime and be together, thanks internet, thanks life :)",01Apr2019,4

One time she  happened to come into my work exactly when we closed, I let her in and made her food and geeked out on her car with her.. we seemed to hit it off.  

She ended up giving me a FAT tip and I always felt bad because the food at the place I worked gets pretty old at the end of the night.  

Fast forward a bit and I see her car a couple times at a little food cart I used to frequent. Turns out she works there.So I bought her a chocolate bar and gave it to her explaining, very awkwardly, that I owed her for that tip.  

I thought I blew it, I was so nervous I couldn't even ask for her name... she gave me the food and I left. WOW. It actually felt oddly good to embarrass myself like that.  

Later, while eating the food I see that she left XOXO written on the inside of the box. STOKED. No phone number though...  

Next time I'm in that part of town I'm going to stop by there and pass her a note after I order asking if she would like to hang out, with my number.  I'll try to get her name this time lol

60,"So, for starters, I'm what I would assume to be as a fairly average individual, but of course I have my qualities. I take medication everyday for depression that has been ongoing since I was 13 and a mood suppressant for my unseasoned moments of panic or hypertension; also a as needed for the moments of extra panic or hypertension. I typically drink an adequate amount of low fat chocolate milk in the mornings to subside moments of hunger since I'm typically mobile or in a setting that doesn't allow for a moment to eat. By the time I am able to eat I usually try to eat something that will last me the rest of the evening until I go to bed. I drink coffee in the mornings, water in the midday, and beer in the evenings; everyday. I'm roughly 190 lbs. of mixed muscle and fat; ""well-marbled"" I call it. Although, altogether, I'm a fairly healthy individual.

My concern though is that at night I haven't been sleeping well. I periodically wake up and stay awake until I get tired enough to fall back asleep an hour or two later. Yet, there have been ""strange"" cases. Last night I woke up to myself screaming, but then I did something that has been becoming more frequent. I was in a semi-conscious/unconscious state and by that I mean I had my eyes open but I didn't want to move or couldn't move. Instead I did what I so commonly do and stare down the hallway leading into the living room believing/expecting to see someone or something. Turns out, last night, I did which is rare. I stared directly at the hallway plug-in light and it started ""changing."" It went from a blurry ball of light, I remove eye-glasses at night to sleep, to some sort of... I don't exactly know how to describe it. I closed my eyes for what seemed like a typical blink and then the light looked as though it turned into a glowing, mass of contorting, blurry human limbs. I remember that all I could do was watch in a mix of fascination and creeping horror; the kind of feeling that gives me goosebumps when I know something is wrong. 

The part that gets to me is that it happened twice... the same night; last night 3/31. You see, the first time I saw this ""amalgamation"" it was all the way at the end of the hallway where the plug-in light was. I fell back asleep, but then woke up again in an unknown amount of time later to find that the ""amalgamation"" had moved closer; just outside the doorway of my room. The clump of limbs was a bit more defined for me to see considering I'm near sighted, and it literally had the posture of what looked like multiple legs with an excessive amount of arms attached to them at a single point where they met in the ""middle."" The thoughts that raced through my head in that moment I can't even begin to accurately recall, but there was  one that stood out from the rest. It was a repeating phrase of something along the lines of ""It's coming,"" or ""Go away."" The thought had something to do with the recognition of the ""amalgamation"" and its location. Damn it I can't recall it now. 

Anyways, the rest of the night was fine. I woke up 10 minutes before 10 a.m. EST and suddenly the memory came rushing back as I began to brew a pot of coffee.

63,"TL;DR: Ever since I was in high school I had a dream of traveling the world. I now have the chance to, don't know if I'm ready, am super scared. 

So basically I have been dreaming of traveling the world ever since I was a teenager. My ultimate goal was to find a way to go on long trips, embrace new cultures and such. When I got to college, I still wanted this more than anything in the world. In the meantime, I developed a very deep depression and anxiety disorder.

Fast forward two years, I'm finally better, off meds and working on getting better everyday. I've been dealing with a lot of anxiety lately (probably because I know have to make a decision about my future), but other than that I can say that I'm fine.
I've finished college, my student loan is almost paid for.

Both me and my boyfriend (25M) work from home on a company that allows us to work remotely. We took a couple of 4-day trips around Europe, but we both had plans to move to Asia or South America for a few months, work remotely, and just travel.

I've been living with my boyfriend in his parents' house for about a year and a half. We started to want more privacy, our own place and such. We have finally found an apartment and it's almost certain that we can move there in a few weeks.
However, as this comes, I'm started to questioning whether or not we should move now, as we will probably just settle and never actually take this opportunity to travel. Our job is a freelance regime, and so it's possible that a year or two from now we won't be at this company anymore. 

I think the reason why we haven't actually done this yet is because I'm scared. I get anxious about a lot of things, like what if it doesn't work out, what if we get fired while so far away from home, etc.

But sometimes I just get this feeling that I gotta do this now or I'll probably never find such a great time to do it.

Today, I was looking around flights and I just got this huge urge to buy those tickets and simply go.
I feel like as much as I really want some privacy and independence, have our own home, our own routine, that is something we can do later, maybe a couple of years from now, whereas I don't know if I'll ever find the right conditions to simply travel.

My boyfriend is very supportive of my decisions, but we've been planning to travel for so long and just keep on delaying it, we both feel like it's just talk and we'll never actually do it. Also, it's always me with doubts and insecurities.

But now I really do have to decide, and I'm so confused. We wanted to live alone for so long, and we just found the perfect house. However, this is a long time dream for both of us.

I guess I just wanted to ask for some advice and perspective from someone else.",01Apr2019,1

81," So my dad is a sucker for love. He has already had 2 ex-wives who have taken him for everything he has, and he is getting ready to get married again. I have never liked this woman a whole lot. She never did much to me but always seemed like a gold digger. She moved in after just a few months of dating, and they got a joint checking account shortly after that. While my dad makes decent money, he doesn't make enough to support his two ex-wives and this one's expensive spending habits. All that aside, I said nothing about the wedding. I am supposed to be a bridesmaid at their wedding in a month. I went over Saturday to help with wedding decorations then got guilted into going out with them Saturday night. She then proceeded to get really drunk (which apparently she does every weekend she doesn't have her daughter) and tell me off and physically got in my face trying to fight me. She shouted some crazy and weird things like that my dad can't take my side, and if he loves me more than her than he should just marry me, etc. Need I remind you that I am a tough farm girl who grew up with four brothers and I could have beaten this woman with one hand tied behind my back. But I refrained for the sake of my father. The only ""apology"" I received was a text at 3 am (to both my dad and I) that night saying ""I apologize for my behavior tonight. Although I don't believe my intentions weren't pure and my reasoning behind it wasn't right, I shouldn't have raised my voice at either of you. Bottom line, sorry it came to that."" I may be old school, but to me that isn't a real apology. She never even addressed getting in my face or the horrible things she said. I will for sure go to the wedding but I am not sure I can spend all day getting ready with her. The itinerary has us starting at 9 in the morning to do hair etc, and the ceremony doesn't even start until 5. While I love my dad, he has had a bad history of putting women in front of his children and I just don't want to make that much of a sacrifice when I know he wouldn't do the same for me. P.S.

As I got older, I started making friends but the friendship would fade after time. I always blamed myself for it. I felt like I wasn't interesting enough, or funny enough, or cool enough. I would overthink everything that I had done to understand what had made them not want to be my friend anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 21 years old now and my situation hasn't improved all that much. I still see my best friend from high school on occasion, but my only true friend is my boyfriend. I had 2 best friends for about a year or so, but I changed majors and they stopped hanging out with me because I wasn't convenient or ""fun"" anymore. I didn't want to go to parties, I didn't want to make an ass of myself in front of a camera for a vlog. Losing those 2 friends really stung because they had thrown me a surprise birthday party back in January for my 21st. It's crazy to think that just a few weeks later, they pretty much ignored any attempt I made to hang out with them. I went over it again and again in my head and tried to understand what I would have done wrong. I couldn't think of anything, which was honestly worse.

This semester, I made some friends at work, but today I learned that they had been hanging out without me for awhile. Instead of feeling down and wondering what was wrong with me, I just let myself understand that it was okay if they didn't want to be around me. I shouldn't want to be around people who don't enjoy my presence for whatever reason. Friendships are a two-way street, always. Sometimes I get lonely, but I have my boyfriend and I'm happy with who I am. Maybe introverted people aren't meant to have as many friends, but that's okay.

We were catching up just chatting about work and such when out of the blue she casually mentions how she heard of a proposed law that would allow minors to have an abortion without parental consent. I thought to myself oh boy here comes another argument about abortion (she knows I'm pro choice) which I don't care to have with her anymore because we will never agree with each other. 

She kept pushing about how the parents should be able to make the decision. Naturally I bring up an extreme example-what if she had a 12 yo daughter who was raped? She went on to tell me there are medications to prevent conception. Obviously this would be the ideal action to take against any rape victim. I pushed a little further asking what if the minor didnt have access to the medication becuase of their location at the time of the assault or if they were kidnapped etc. My MOM told me she(the minor) would HAVE to give birth if that were the case-no two ways about it.

I literally felt sick to my stomach after she said this. I couldn't believe those words came out of my own mother's mouth. Now I grew up in a middle class family, I had a great childhood, plenty of friends, loved sports and my parents were very supportive and involved in whatever I did. I thought she was about all I could ask for in a mom but after hearing her opinion my head was just spinning.

What if I was the 12 year old girl who was raped and too scared to tell anyone until I was pregnant? My own mom would have told me that as a middle schooler I'm going to give birth before the year was up. As an adult male I still can't even handle this idea.

My job is stressful so the days off where I can stay home and relax are really something I look forward to every week.

110,"Backstory: I've always worked in human services. A few years ago I lost a loved one to addiction. After that, I decided to transition specifically to Substance Abuse. 

So a few years ago I left my cushy set your own hours, work from home job to take a job with a substance abuse treatment agency. My first day, first minute on the job I met a woman in the elevator, let's call her Q. Q introduced herself to me and asked what I would be doing with the company. I told her. She responded with an odd intensity in her voice ""oh. I applied for that position, but instead they offered me (lesser position)"" I said oh, ok. Must be they saw something in you that would make you a standout in (lesser position)! I look forward to working with you! Meanwhile I'm thinking it might be a good idea to steer clear of her.  We spent a few months training at the main branch before moving over to our permanent location. When we weren't shadowing senior staff, we had a small break room they had set aside for us. I got to know Q pretty well during that time.  I noticed that she was late by at least 15 minutes everyday, she was always on her phone and she would burst into tears at any given moment. She also had MAJOR boundary issues. At first I felt bad for her and ignored my gut instinct. I tried to be kind to her, then I realized- this woman is nuts and using her life as a tool for attention and manipulation. I spent the remainder of my time at the main branch actively trying to avoid her while learning as much as I can about my new job.

We moved to our permanent offices and everything got progressively worse. Our new office was basically one big room. She became more and more intrusive as time went on (boundaries). She came in later and later. Would have loud arguments with her children on the phone in the middle of the office. She was forming unhealthy relationships with clients. One of her job duties involved going to court with clients- we received complaints from court officials about her antics and were forced to pull her from that. We had to stop her from answering the phone  bc she was giving out incorrect information to cooperating agencies. The more we tried to help her, the more she acted out. Finally, one day, I was working on an urgent case. She had a client (not urgent) that needed a task done. She asked me if I had been able to do it yet. I explained to her that client X needed this task done immediately and that as soon as I had a chance I would get to it. She asked me again 2 minutes later. I explained I would do it as soon as I humanly could. She asked when. I said I will do it today, but can't right now.  Then again. Then again. Then again. Well, finally, after a while of this,  I snapped. I took a tone (not shouting, but firm) and said ""not right now, Q. I'm busy at the moment. It will be taken care of later."" She looked at me like I'd punched her in the gut and screamed "" why are you so mean to me? You're always so mean to me!"" I've had enough of her dramatics at this point and said ""you need to stop painting yourself as the perpetual victim your whole life and take a good long look at yourself."" It was at that point she stood up and ran out of the room crying. The rest of the office sat there and stared for a minute. I got a few congratulations, but that wasn't my concern. Moments later I got a text from my boss who was out that day asking if we were ok. I said yes, I'm fine (someone must've texted him).  
Since that day, she has used that one incident as a weapon against me. After another extremely inappropriate incident with a client in which another co-worker had to intervene, she was transferred to another branch for closer supervision. Everytime I spoke to someone from that office I was told how annoying she is, no one knows why she's still there, boundary issues, etc. Occasionally, the incident with me would be brought up in supervisory meetings. Super annoying, but I assured everyone it was in the past and wouldn't happen again. I still saw her on my rare appearance in that office. She always went out of her way to see me, which was weird. Then at the company Christmas party, she showed up at my table, pulled a chair up so close she was touching me, got right in my face and started talking to me. It was weird and intrusive, but I was cordial then excused myself to use the restroom. I thought I was done with her with the exception of those few episodes, until the other day. I get called to a meeting with my supervisor who informs me that I am now being transferred to another branch and stripped of all status I have gained. I found out through the grapevine that she played the single mom card and had successfully alienated everyone at that branch. No one wants her there, but they can't technically fire her. So she has requested a transfer back to my branch to shorten her commute. She has also requested that she, under no circumstances, work with me. I have contacted HR to voice my complaint. Unfortunately, my company is calling this a lateral move and an opportunity. I'm making the best of it. But I'm miserable. 

TL,DR; Awful woman creates own drama, uses it as a weapon against me. Now I'm miserable. ",01Apr2019,14
111,"Today has me down.

For a while I’ve really tried to keep a positive attitude after being booted from a toxic friend group(so losing friends, one I used to be best friends with) and then having to come to terms with what it means to lose people like that.

And then I thought I had a friend who was in the same boat as me. He was kicked from that group too because he didn’t align with their group think and that annoyed them(mostly the leader) so he was kind of like my support beam for a bit. Also someone that I thought understood the situation.

The other day he went back to them because they said he was “Okay now” and he didn’t annoy them anymore.

And since then he’s been acting weird around me so I also feel like shit too. I feel lonely and everything feels kind of hard at the moment.

I know my values and my morals and I believe in them and I keep seeing this situation as stupid but also am I wrong? Why did he go back to those mean people? Am I doing bad things? Like I don’t know anymore",01Apr2019,2
