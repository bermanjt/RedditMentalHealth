1,"Before I say anything, two things: I am pretty liberal myself (just not sjw) and this is entirely a rant. I decided to rant on Reddit because I feel like people on Twitter or Tumblr would reprimand me.

So. I'm 17 and I have a group of four friends. All of them are very liberal about everything, which I'm honestly fine with, since I don't really allow politics to dictate my friendships.  

But lately they've been ranting about sjw issues SO MUCH that it has gotten incredibly self-righteous and downright ridiculous. The other day my friend told me I can't say ""crazy"" because it's ableist. I tried to tell her that it is a semantic shift and not offensive, but she wouldn't hear it. They automatically assume that their opinion is right, without ever fact-checking or educating themselves on politics/government/society.

Also, they've been self-diagnosing themselves with depression, autism, etc. I know I can't understand what happens behind closed doors, but they haven't even gone to a psychiatrist or anything.

In conclusion, my friends are beginning to irk me and I really needed to rant about it. This probably sounded really whiny. Thanks for reading if you did.",03Apr2017,2
4,"I come from a codependency and alcohol broken family, my dad just, moved to his sisters house, I stay with my mom. He keeps visiting me like 2 times a week and calls me almost every night. I don't want to talk to him because there is never a conversation, only monosyllabes, he never reads books, never cares about anything that involves acquiring knowledge,  and I just can't stand that; because is there's not monosyllabes he shows up his Fucked up thoughts and retarded logic, also he is so immature that when someone doesn't agree with what he's saying he becomes angry and say bad stuff, the worst of all is that I've absorbed through my life wrong behaviors, and I think I cannot fix me if I continue with this bad relationship. What do you guys think? ",03Apr2017,1

7,"It worth pointing out that I have severe clinical depression, and I am female, so hormones might play into it. 

It's not like I'm just sitting around and burst into tears. It's more like I'm over-empathetic. Normally a sad story will make me go ""wow, that's awful"" but instead I've just been crying. It's not really a problem, just odd. ",03Apr2017,45
9,"I started my day by feeling offended at lunch and while I didn't make a scene I left to go home in clearly a strange mood Both my brother and mom asked me what was wrong. I said nothing just because I started to doubt about if I had had legitimate reasons to feel offended in the first place.

I watched BLL's finale and since I know my brother watches and was still feeling guilty from lunch and wanted to bond I texted him a minute after the ending. He never answered back and now I realize my comment might have very well spoiled the ending for him if he didn't watch it. I feel to sorry for this shit.

I texted my ex with whom we had a fwb situation for a few weeks and with whom something strange happened last time (I felt he was sad, but couldn't figure if it's because he wants to be with me for real and thinks I don't or because he doesn't want to and thinks I do. We do not communicate well..). For the first time ever, he didn't answe back. I texted him a how are you but intended to ask him to talk and tell him my feelings: I am in love with him and would like to be with him for real. It's ok if he doesn't want to, but him not answering back makes me feel really uneasy.

I lost my late dads pencil. I can even write about this one. And a ring too, which upsets me greatly but it was going to happen sometime-I have always taken off rings without thinking because I can't use them, I always just feel them in my hands and take them off unconsciously.

So, I'm trying to avoid guilt because it it the worst, most useless, most destroying feeling ever, but today I'm flooded by it. I just want to say I'm sorry, or I want to feel like not needing to say I'm sorry.",03Apr2017,1
10,"I'm sure it's not as serious as some stuff on this sub, but I am so sick of people acting like Rick and Morty is life or death to them and how big it is here in Reddit, like we get it, it's a (kinda) funny show, but it's not so absolutely life-defining like so many people make it out to be. I've seen the entire first season and part of season 2 and I tried to enjoy it as much as everyone else seems to, but it's just ""meh"". I didn't even finish season 2 since it just wasn't that entertaining or funny to watch. I know many people will probably disagree with me, but I think that the only reason that so many people like it is because their friend said it was amazing who's other friend said it was amazing and so on making it only good in their eyes as confirmation bias so that they can be in the circlejerk. And it does frustrate me because there are many ^^objectively better shows like South Park and the like.

11,"**27 years.**

That's the time period where The Undertaker has been a wrestler within the United States with prominence. 

**20 years.**

That's how long I've been a massive fan. 

The Undertaker has been one of the most popular wrestlers in the past 20 years in large part due to his ability to perform. In recent years that ability has deteriorated due to issues with his hip which requires surgery. But for the 20 years I have watched him wrestle he was always one of my favorites. 

[Spoilers](/The Undertaker lost for the second time at Wrestlemania and left his ring gear behind signalling it's finally over. Further supported by him breaking Kayfabe for only the second time in his career.)

It might be dorky as hell. It might be nerdy. BUT I have no shame in admitting that tonight has made me the saddest I've been in a long time. Knowing that things will never be the same is damn hard even when you've prepared for it. 

So Thank you Undertaker, Mark Calloway, for 20 years of some of the best damn entertainment I've had in my entire life. While it can be attributed to the company, you played a large part in my life growing up and I will never forget what you've done for me by putting your body on the line for near 30 years.

12,"I currently live in the United States. I'm 22 and just about to finish college with a degree in Political Science with a Minor in International Economics. I'm not the best student nor do I have the most experience in business. Without relying on finding a job that'll give me a 6 digit salary, how can an average person with nothing really holding them down move their life to another country. I'm not moving for any other reason than just wanting to explore the world and live in a new atmosphere. Countries of interest would be Australia, France (I don't speak French), or the U.K.. In order of desire.",03Apr2017,19
15,"Apologies for the extremely long wall of text. If you like reading other people's stories, have fun.

I met this girl on Tinder on July 2016. She is 17 years old, while I'm 20 (keep in mind that in my country, the age of consent is 14 and age of majority is 18). Our conversation went really smoothly for a week or so, she told me really personal things, problem she had with her father growing up (which is important to note), and all that crap. She's also told me she never went out with anyone from Tinder before, and after a few days she took the liberty of asking me out. We lived 25 km away from each other, but that didn't stop us from meeting. We went into the shopping mall, she went with two of her girl friends (let's call them Allie and Bree). Bree was sort of jealous of my (soon to be) girlfriend and the other way around as well. I kissed her the first time while her friends were buying some candy for the movies. We went into the movies, I sat by my girl and we kept on holding hands and all that kind of stuff teenagers do in the movie theater. After the session we took a walk to the mall and parted ways. I was afraid of her not liking me (she surely didn't show she was enjoying it too much, at least in the beginning, after a while she seemed to open up a bit more and even held my hand at her own will). While I was taking the bus home she messaged thanking me for the great time and said she was looking forward to the next. I was really happy, this was the first time I ever went out on a date and did OK.


A few days later she sends me a screenshot of her Messenger page, it was filled with guys saying ""hey"" or ""hey cutie"", that kind of stuff. I was really upset by that, but then again, we weren't dating (yet), so I had no saying in that. I just showed some jealousy and moved on with my life. Now, here's where the worst of me started showing up - jealousy and possessiveness. Let's call him Robert. For every single post on her Facebook, the very same guy commented and reacted on. He lived in the same city as her, but according to her, they never met personally, just a Facebook friendship. Speaking of which, her friends list on Facebook 4.5k people, and that really screwed me up. I've always been a guy of few friends (I had 200 or so friends on Facebook only), and I always saw this as a ""need"" for attention coming from her. Come on, do you really need 4k people on Facebook? She didn't even know 1/5 of those people. But then again, I had no saying on her friendship with Robert (nor on anyone else) because I just ""arrived"" and they've been friends for longer than I even knew her. I started to add a lot of people that I had friends in common on Facebook too, just to mess with her, and she would complain how most of them were female, to the point she would comment on the friendship saying ""I won't even say anything"" and things of the sort. I just find it ""funny"" how she would complain about me doing it, but I didn't have the right to complain about her doing the same because that was ""possessiveness"" or ""extreme jealousy"" coming from me.


Things were getting serious, we kept on talking about dating, I even bought a pair of rings to give her, and towards the end of September we arranged to see each other, Bree went along as she couldn't go alone because of her parents, and I finally gave her the ring. We were now ""officially"" dating.


A couple weeks later she messages me laughing and tells me that the girlfriend of a guy she went out with from Tinder has contacted her about a photo of my girlfriend and her boyfriend together. Said guy is a foreigner, and was in my country for a short amount of time. I recalled she told me she never went out with anyone from Tinder before and asked her whether she lied to me before we met personally saying she never went out with anyone, or if she went out with him after we were close enough to talk about dating. I never got a concrete answer from herself, I had to find out on my own (which I'll mention later on). Now, cheating is something I never tolerated. I wouldn't do it, so I can only expect the same from her. At the end of the day I decided to forgive her lying because I wasn't sure if it was before or after we were too close.
For two months we were just fine, meeting in person, though rarely, until I saw she gave her a heart reaction on a picture of said foreigner who came back to my country. He was on a beach with a few friends. I was REALLY upset by that. She lied to me about him before, and now ""loves"" a picture he is in. To me, the ""love"" reaction on Facebook is given to something you, well, like A LOT. I questioned her whether she had feelings for him or something, she kept on denying and saying that she doesn't see the reaction as a ""second intention"" thing, just as a normal thing. I told her that I didn't like seeing a heart given by her at a picture of a guy she went out with. Once again I started questioning her about the guy and she told me they just kissed at the date and that was it. I made her delete the guy and told her he was dead for her, they were never to speak again.


She showed me a screenshot of a guy from her class asking if he could go and see her at her house later that night. The guy said that he ""heard"" last year people saying she took guys home to do ""things"" to them (yes, he said precisely that, ""things""). I MADE her give me his number to threat him, but she simply did not want to because she thought I was going to be ""too harsh"" and it her parents would find out about us if I threatened him too hard. I told her ""HE JUST CALLED YOU A WHORE, DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK?"", to which she replied ""AND WHO DOESN'T CALL ME THAT?"". To this day I don't know how to feel about that. I suppose that after her nudes got leaked, the entire city (which is rather small) got to know about it and she got known as a whore or promiscuous. After insisting, I got his number, threatened him and got done with it. She told me things about her past that I really didn't need to know, more specifically, her sexual past. She told me she had leaked nudes by a guy she liked a lot when she was just 13(!), that she'd done anal, she'd taken two guys into her house (supposedly one at a time) when her parents weren't home, that sort of thing. Now, I'm no saint. That being said, I do NOT like promiscuity. And she was very promiscuous. At least her past self was.
She kept on complaining about her parents being too close-minded. They didn't let her leave the house too much and were too controlling over her. By this point, they were already aware of my presence because she had told them. Her father was okay with it, but her mother was reluctant. She didn't even want to meet me, ever. She told her daughter I was just trying to use her, that I was at an age of going out to clubs and stuff, get a lot of girls, the perfect stereotyped young adult. Mind you, I'm the complete opposite. I like staying at home, watching movies, rarely hang out with friends, hate clubs and parties of the sort, don't drink nor smoke. Her mother never cared to even message me. It was simply ""no, you will not date, you need to study"". Maybe it has something to do with her mother's past that made her so close minded like that. Her mother got married after dating for mere months, at her exact age, so I think that explains a lot about her conduct. She also told my girlfriend I was just a phase on her life, and she would forget about me soon enough.


We debated several times about me showing up by surprise when she was hanging out her parents, but we always reconsidered at the final moment for fear - it was better to keep on seeing each other hidden from her parents than being prohibited from doing so, provided they didn't like me (unlikely if they cared to meet me, by the way). I gave her a lot of gifts. Chocolates, cards, plushies, even lingerie, all that kind of stuff. In December she gave me a plushie bear, 90 heart shaped papers, each one with a reason why she loved me, some chocolate and my favorite candy. I was SUPER happy, that was probably one of the happiest moments of my life. She took the time and effort to MAKE ME the hearts, to go and buy a cute bear, candies, that kind of thing. (Note that her father knew she bought the bear and it was for me, and he thought it was cute of her and was happy for us, her mother never knew about it).


After January our relationship started going downhill. She had started a new course in the afternoon, which added to her busy morning at school, would completely kill the time we had together as she couldn't go out on weekends because of her parents. The only time we could see each other was if she skipped or didn't have class in the morning, which is when her parents aren't home and I could go and see her at her own house.
One day, at 5 AM in the morning, I started to notice that she was talking to someone else at the messenger app we used (WhatsApp), and I questioned her about it. She reluctantly told me she was talking to a boy friend of hers about the woman he ""loves"". I told her I didn't approve the fact that she was having side conversations that late at night/early in the morning, specially this kind of conversation. She went nuts telling me I was trying to control her and that how unacceptable that is. I told her to do whatever the f she wanted to and went to bed.


In February she started to change completely, supposedly because of her tight schedule. We didn't talk like we used to. Usually we had conversations the entire day, about a lot of things, but now it was just... blank. She would be online on WhatsApp for a while, not talk to me, then go offline. And that went on. And on. And on. I complained her lack of conversation with me but abundance with others, and she kept on saying that if I really wanted to, I could start a conversation on my own. That's not how it used to be. She was talking to others and keeping me on the side. Now, with the new course she met a lot of new people, and that added to my insecurity. She lived far away. She could take people in her home when her parents weren't ther. She lied to me before, what makes her be honest now? I know of her past, I know what she is capable of doing behind my back or her parents. I know she's using the platform we used to use for ourselves to talk to other people now. I noticed she stopped liking the stuff I posted on Facebook but liked the stuff that other people from her course posted, specifically one guy, which, by the way, was pretty much the same content I posted.


That started killing me on the inside, so I decided it was about time to leave. I told her everything that was bothering me and she, without hesitation, said it was ""okay"". She didn't really seem to care to see me leaving, seemed to want me to. And so I went on with my life. For two days. Then I messaged her again asking for a ""chance"", if she still loved me. She said she still did. However, my confidence in her had already gone down the drain, and so I went to use my fake Facebook profile to look for people in her area on Tinder. And sure enough, there she was. ""I still love you"" on the previous day, and a ""I didn't even match anyone, I was just seeing how Tinder is doing"". I told her I didn't want to see her again, I was wrong in coming back and left once again. I set fire to everything she gave me, the pictures, the hearts, the bear, everything. But ONCE AGAIN, two days later, I go back to her. Mind you, it took me 3 hours to write her a message asking for a final chance. She said there was still hope for us, and so we went back. I apologized, made sure she knew it wasn't only my fault, that she's also caused that.

One step at a time we started understanding each other again. She was pissed off about me burning the things, seemed to care more about the action of me destroying them than for my actual feelings. She asked me if I wasn't gonna add her on Facebook again, and so I did. Still in February, it was her birthday, and I decided to send her a gift. We couldn't see each other as she would hang out with her parents at the mall by day and eat some pizza with them at night, so I went on to contact Allie, asked her if I could send her a package to deliver to my girlfriend. She agreed, so I went on to a flower shop in my city and asked for them to deliver Allie some flowers, a big bear plushie, some chocolates and a card. In the card I said ""happy birthday, cutie, I wish you all the best and I hope you know I will wait for you no matter how long it takes"". Allie delivered it to her at the presence of my girlfriend's mother. Her mother loved it, even called me ""son-in-law"" to her friend, said that I must really care for her. Still, she never bothered contacting me to meet the guy that really cared for her daughter. I asked my girlfriend if we could arrange a meeting now, but she hesitated and said that her mother still wasn't ready for it, that she wouldn't allow it even after the gift I sent her.


A few weeks later we arranged some time to see each other at her home, while her parents were away. While I was going, she messaged me telling that her mother authorized her going to a famous party we have in my entire country. I was extremely let down by that. Her mother won't allow her daughter see me, but would let her go to a party which is famous for its promiscuity. After I questioned my girlfriend about this, she told me that her mom allowed her to go because her cousin would go with his girlfriend, so it was all good in her mind. After I arrived at her house, we laid down in bed. I was hugging her while she was on Facebook and we would talk about the things we saw. The same guy that was talking to her at 5 AM that day sent her a REALLY cheerful ""Heeeeey! Good mooooooorning!"". That pissed me off, but I decided to ignore it, as she didn't reply him while I was there. The phone dropped to the bed, I picked it up, put it aside and told her it was about time to leave, so I just wanted to cuddle for a bit. She shoved me off to the side and said it was ""too hot"" to cuddle (as in temperature). That really made me sad. I take THREE HOURS to reach her home, and she tells me it's ""too hot"" to cuddle for a few minutes? Come on... I should have left straight away, but I spent a few more minutes and decided to take off. While she was opening the door I kissed her and said ""I love you"". She turned her back to open the door completely, said she loved me back without even looking at me and went outside to scout the street to see if I could safely leave without anyone noticing.


A few days later things start to get difficult again, we were barely talking to each other the entire day, I noticed she gave heart reactions to another random good looking guy and sad reactions on posts about kisses, one in specific that said ""I'm sad about people who take pictures showing their tongue but don't use them while they kiss"". I told her, once again, that this kind of thing is unacceptable and I wouldn't tolerate that, but she seemed not to care enough, though she stopped. And, surely enough, the very next day she started another friendship on Facebook. Everyday she would start friendships with about 5 people, most of them male, but this one was different. It was the very foreigner from Tinder I told her never to speak with again. The guy that was dead for her. Only after that I realized it was over for good. I told her it was a mistake for us to try again and asked why she did that, if it was because she wanted ME to end things because she didn't have courage to. She told me she did want to break up, but she didn't do those things for me to break up without her taking responsibility. I know for a fact she was lying. I told her how it's ironic that the guy I said was dead for her is very much alive and I'm the one who is dead, and how her mother was right about me just being a phase on her life. She denied the latter deeply and said it was very intense, and that's all that matters for her, no matter if it worked out at the end, it was a great experience and she'd never forget about me.


After the final break up I removed her number from my phone book, deleted her from Facebook and moved on with my life. I was finally getting over her, though I would still check her friends posts to see if she was active on their profiles. But I was keeping to myself without contacting her. I shared a post that said ""with 7 billion people on Earth, do you still think that only one is perfect for you?"" and made it public. A few days later she liked the post and I found her number and messaged her a question mark. She read it but didn't reply.


Bree contacted me about a post a made, completely unrelated to my relationship with my (now) ex and we got talking. I asked her about the foreigner and Bree told me she indeed accompanied my girlfriend on the date with the foreigner from Tinder in late August early September, mere two weeks before I asked her to date me. I took my ex now as dead for good.


Towards the end of February I accidentally clicked the ""message requests"" tab on Facebook and noticed she'd sent me a sad emoji of a cat (that had significance for us) one day earlier. I asked her what was up and she said that she was sad at the time, apologized for bothering me and said she was okay already. I made the conversation short and said ""okay"". I contacted Allie the same day, told her I was worried about my ex and she said she would try to find out what's going on (though I'm pretty sure she knew). The very next morning my ex messages me lyrics of our favorite song, and we start talking again. I told her precisely how I was feeling. The feeling of being backstabbed by someone you loved, how she could have lied so many times, how I cared for her, all that crap. I told her we needed to talk in person, looking at each other's eyes, and she agreed. We would have met past Friday. However, she said we would have a short amount of time due to her parents work schedule changes, so we would have to talk on the street in front of her house to avoid getting caught - it was better being caught in front of her closed house than on the inside, provided her mother came back earlier than expected. I told her I wasn't going to take 3 hours of traffic to talk about such private things on the street, so we postponed it to another day, which I'm still waiting.


I never lied to her. When I was with her, I was with her. I didn't have ""side conversations"" as she's had since the start of this year. We used to be so close together, but now she seems to need this side attention from people. I don't understand that. I always put her first in all things I did, always gave her 100% of my free time (which is the entire day, since I'm unemployed), but that seemed to no longer be enough. She needed more attention, more people in her life. I told her despite of the (low but existent) age gap between us, we are on completely different phases of our lives. I've finished college, she still didn't even finish high school yet. I like to dedicate my attention to one person, whereas she likes to receive attention from several at a time. She admitted being immature, I strongly agreed and said I didn't need to go through the suffering she put me towards the last few weeks of our failing relationship. She said she couldn't imagine how I felt, but she was wrong in doing all those things.


Now, I know she is promiscuous, I know she lied, I know she lives (somewhat) faraway and can take other people home whenever she wants, I know she talked to me while on a date with another guy from Tinder and I didn't even suspect a thing. To me, she was at home, while she was kissing a guy on the shopping mall with the very same girls that accompanied her to see me.


We had to put our meeting on hold for now, since we couldn't arrange a time this past week. Provided this go through, I'm planning on telling her everything exactly how it is, even ask for her Facebook password. I already told her I would only agree to go back with her parents blessing, but she said it would be impossible because they are paying her an extra course at night and they would stop because they think she couldn't conciliate study and date.


I'm looking forward to meeting her in person and let it all out with her. With all this being said, any opinions on my situation? I really want her back, but I think that I miss having someone to talk to, not her, specifically, though I think about her all the time.

normally i just sit there emotionless, moseying around doing nothing with myself procrastinating my life away. lately i took some initiative and got on birth control, which has led me to at least feel something which is great, but all i feel now is pain late at night for being so worthless. 

havent felt this way since grade school honestly, this was a regular thing then, but i was so much better ever since. but going back to school at 25 literally feels like it is killing me, i am not sure what to do or how to fix it.",03Apr2017,2

19,"I've been posting on reddit for about 5 years on various accounts. I've deleted many of them for various reasons, but this old throwaway I made in 2011 is still here. I don't know if anyone will read this, but I've decided to quit reddit (and spend less time on the internet in general), so I thought I'd say a few parting words. 

reddit has given me a lot. I actually found my first job through a comment someone made on a local subreddit. I've asked for advice on various things through the years and gotten thoughtful responses from kind redditors. I've learnt a lot of interesting things, including some things which helped me get through college.

The thread that got me hooked on reddit was an AMA from a guy who grew up in a tiny town called Zinc, Arkansas - which has like only 50 people living in it. I found the idea of his rural upbringing both depressing and cool, but above all else very fascinating. 

Over the years I've laughed a lot at the memes, funny videos, and the witty comments. I will never forget waking up one morning a few summers back and reading the ""which celebrity needs to come out of the closet"" thread and laughing so hard.

But at the end of the day, even with the good things, I regret spending as much time here as I did. I won't lie to myself, I was addicted to reddit for quite a long time. there were days where I would practically use reddit non stop from morning 'til night. I spent way too much time on reddit when I was in school. I regret browsing reddit during breaks in class when I could have sparked up conservations with the people around me. 

And that's part of why I need to leave. It's time to move on. bye",03Apr2017,42
20,"Oh man. OH. FUCKING. MAN. Day one of my month long work decompression started with 2 tabs of acid and oh man it was good. Its funny though- The best part didnt come until after the high, but the high was a journey for sure :)

I started to feel neat so I just went walking. I walked wherever things took me, listening to music. The usual mix- Dark Side of the moon, and some Flaming Lips. I got a little paranoid and thought people were following me, and I kept getting turned around and ended up passing the same apartment building 3 times which freaked me out a little bit haha, but I felt like a kid again exploring, and seeing things like they were new. I decided to head back home after 3 hours.

Came home, hung out with my girlfriend. We watched some stuff. But... No anxiety. Just... Just happiness. Peace. And I started thinking about things... I have all these awful fears that manifest as depression and anxiety. But WHY!? Nothing has meaning! Life is inherently meaningless! But why should I let that get me down? I can embrace this empty void and all the absurdity contained in that and live my short pointless life and be content! I give my own life meaning, by virtue of experiencing this amazing world! I have this amazing family, great friends, a wonderful girlfriend and a career that might exacerbate my anxiety- But one I have passion and drive for! FUCK THE VOID. Nothing matters- But that doesnt matter! I matter! You matter! 

So Im reading about Albert Camus and absurdism as a philosophy and one article I was reading linked the song ""Is that all there is"" by a [Peggy Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sWTnsemkIs) and it just kind of set me on a track... Oh man... I think I had the opposite of an anxiety attack. I started crying, but I was laughing at the same time. I wasnt crying because I was laughing- I was legitimately despairing, and at the same time feeling this amazing elation of positive emotions. I started listening to Ghost Mice, Streetlight Manifesto and some other stuff. I cant describe the feelings of freedom I was feeling. I havent felt this good in... Well Ive never felt this good. 

What did I learn? What does it matter? I just need to be happy. I need to live in the moment and cherish the time I have, and the people around me. Things can get hard, and they'll probably get harder- But I cant just stop. There is no stop- Ive torn myself down and stomped on my self harder than anything this world has to offer. What the fuck else can stop me? Im my own worst enemy, and I live with myself [EVERY.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9vzxzjsv6g) [FUCKING.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwVhCFi8PFQ) [DAY.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2IPsu0yYbE) [Where do I go from here?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8ofhjI6ODc) Ive still got a long way to go- But maybe today Im a little bit better.

On a side note I discovered a ton of great music!

I dont know why I felt the need to make a post here. It just felt good writing this stuff out. Maybe its just a bunch of gibberish. I dont know, and I dont really care. At the very least maybe somebody will discover some of this amazing music like I did! Or dont. So it goes...

22,"The following is a true account of a night spent smoking up the kush. By writing this I'm not promoting the use of cannabis. I only want to start my own journal. I can't remember exactly when this took place...there have been many nights like this.  It was probably 2 weeks ago. 

7pm, Friday night. It's time to roll that shizzle up. Put the kettle on...""I'm gonna smoke this one with some jasmine green tea."" The first joint I take my time with - I roll it lovingly into a perfect cone. Pack it down artfully, admire its form. Open the window, headphones on...it's time to enjoy a long, smooth smoke. 

About three quarters of the way into the joint, it starts to hit me. Head first, then into my extremities. It's just after dusk and the sky is an agreeable shade of purple, the wind doesn't feel so cold, I start swaying to the beats in my headphones.

15 mins later. I do my check to ascertain the level of my stonedness after the first J. I look in the bathroom mirror. Yep. I'm high as f2ck. The guy looking back carries all the trademarks: half closed eyelids, blood shot eyes, permanent smile characterized by giggling fits. I try to set my face into a serious 'normal' looking expression, but this only makes me laugh even harder. The music is still playing in my ears. I'm in jogging pants, slippers, and nothing else. I admire my rippling muscles in the mirror (O.K that's just my imagination getting started). 

After leaving the bathroom I make an effort to think about what to do next. Should I stay in and play hours of video games? Should I go for a walk and see where my feet take me? I decide I have enough time for both. I game for a couple of hours, with a smoke break. I then have a mind-blowing thought. Why not drive to the beach; I mean, the sky looked so beautiful when it was purple.. there'll be stars out tonight for sure. 

This seems like the greatest idea ever. I roll a 'take out'. Music is now coming out of my bluetooth speakers, loud. This one takes a long time to roll, as I often burst into fits of dancing whenever the beat drops. It takes me a long time to get dressed and remember where I put my keys, but after about 45 mins, I'm in my car. 

Paranoid now because I'm so damn baked. I wonder what strain of weed this is. It's mentally potent. I repeat to myself out loud ""You're so damn faded dude!"". The car smells great, I congratulate myself for freshening it up earlier. I stash away the take out joint. Check all pockets; everything is where it should be. 

I'm on the road but it's not until I've left the city proper that I crank up the music. I'm paranoid about the feds. Constantly checking my mirrors, I switch to stealth mode (this is the term I give it when I turn off all of my dashboard lights so my face is not lit up). My car is a low, black coupe, very discreet. Sporty, but not gangster. 

I don't make it all the way to the beach. A parking area next to the bay catches my eye. I do an illegal u-turn. Doesn't matter, road is empty. Parking the car, I'm delighted to notice that this particular spot affords an incredible view of the city skyline. Couldn't ask for a better spot to hot box. The engine is off and I'm still in stealth mode. I do a 360 degree check - road is still empty. There are a couple of cars parked in front of me but they seem to be here for the view. Probably couples, I think to myself.

I get to blazing for the third time this evening. When hot-boxing, I like to take my time. Let the car fill with smoke slowly. Halfway into the J I'm in a haze, both physically and mentally. The music starts to echo, the skyline merges with the ripples in the water, my mind goes crazy with random thoughts. After an unknown amount of time I realize how damn cloudy the car has got. A car in front of me cracks a window open, smoke billows out of it. I do the same. It's not a couple in the car in front, it's a dude, just like me. 

Time to hit the road, time to go home. Everything I do slowly and deliberately, knowing  I have to be extra careful. My engine roars to life (at least, I hear a 'roar'). Stealth mode...activated. Both windows are slightly open to let the stink out. 

Back on the road, the sea-view fills my windscreen. About a mile back, the twinkling lights of the skyline fast approaches. How fast am I going? Is my speedometer even working? Why are the street lights so beautiful now? I pretend I'm in a black hole, and the road is actually a tunnel to another dimension. The road is empty still, so I press the gas to the floor. The engine responds and growls, the needle edges up. I keep it in high revs to listen to the V8 sing. (It's not a V8 engine, but I convice myself it is). I start making ""vroom vroom"" noises myself. 

And then, the pinnacle of the evening arrives. When I'm stoned, music is almost always playing, I'm rarely without it. One of my favorite songs comes on, and it drops at the perfect moment. The beat comes in as I gaze at the skyline of the city. My vision blurs, I notice I'm crying because I'm incredibly moved by the beauty of the music and view combined - they seem to go hand in hand. I'm driving and I'm crying, and I feel euphoric. 

Back home and I start to feel tired - the dopamine surge has drained me. I make a weird sandwich/taco hybrid snack; it tastes amazing of course. I make two more and gobble them down like a hungry bear coming out of hibernation. I narrate to myself how damn tasty it is. ""Dude, you could open a restaurant with this shit!"" I hear myself say. 

I find myself spacing out on the sofa wearing a waistcoat, for the life of me I can't remember when or why I put the waistcoat on, but I find it hilarious. I laugh until I feel like I can't breathe, then I monologue to myself about my life. After that I realize that I haven't thought about women for hours. That's unusual for me.  I then start fantasizing about my ex girlfriend, how damn hot she is, and how freaky we got. I scold myself for ending the relationship. So I reach for my laptop... 

30 mins later or so, I'm fast asleep.

23,"I am myself on a journey to become the best version of myself. However I'm still pretty much behind in life. My work ethic is below average (in my opinion) and I can't even manage to go to school regularly. And then I look at people like my dad. FYI we are a minority. So he came to a foreign country not even knowing the language or culture and managed to survive. Including building up his own business. His wife left him, he had ungrateful children who did nothing but play video games all day and yet he managed to go to work everyday, working over 10hours a day for over 8years. Not even your average work, he had to lead a business.

I remember him struggling just to get out of bed. But he still did it. Everyday. Then you look at me who can't even do his minor tasks he set himself up. 


My usual day consists of going to work/school, jogging 5k, reading 20min , meditating 10min and forcing myself to socialise on the weekends. And I struggle with that. On some days I don t go to school because it's overwhelming me. Or sometimes I get too tired to read 20min day.

24,"My post 8 days ago calling for peace through trying times remains true, especially in the wake of this most recent tragedy. Many people said I was full of shit, some even called me a shill, but for god's sake please take my advice.

(https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/61lqnk/dear_russian_chinese_and_american_citizens_please/)

DO NOT allow those responsible to divide us; whether it is religious extremists, a crazed lone wolf, or a governments false flag operation. We must *NOT* allow this to divide us and we must *NOT* allow them to distract us.

Like every event, be skeptical. **QUESTION EVERYTHING**.

If it comes out that this is the product of religious extremism, remember that these asshole(s) are a minuscule subset of a very large population. Do not target your hatred towards innocent believers in a shared faith. They have done nothing wrong.

If it comes out that this is the result of a lone wolf. Fuck him/her. But do not allow our governments to ramp up the surveillance state, impose draconian laws, or take away existing freedoms.

And if it is suspected that this is a false flag, if this is the result of one or more of our governments trying to initiate chaos as a distraction or as catalyst - remember who the true enemy is. It is not the citizens of said country; It is the leadership. If it comes out that any of our countries governments had a hand in the deaths of these innocent individuals, we **ALL** need to stand together in solidarity and fight. By any means necessary.

To the families and friends of the victims and to the people of Russia as a whole, today is another dark day for humanity and this is a future we should not have to be a part of, you have my utmost condolences.

26,"I will try and make this long complicated story short.

My fiance and I lived in the PNW for awhile and moved back home (Southern US) this past November. We both miss it, and I hate my current job. I really good friend got me an interview with her company back in the PNW. The application, interview, and acceptance happened within a week and I've been thrilled. 

But I feel like a coward because now I'm having second thoughts. I'll be leaving my parents again, who I am extremely close with. My mom is my best friend. I don't want to even think about starting a family until we live at least within driving distance. 

I've had plans to meet up with one of my best friends for about 6 months. My new job is requiring me to start when we are supposed to see each other, so I will have to bail on her. I haven't seen her in two years, and because everything happened so quickly with this job I am backing out on her last minute after we booked hotels and everything. I've tried telling my new employer I need to start the next week but it's not going to happen. I feel terrible about this. 

Then, our wedding is happening in October, down here in the South. We've got most of the planning done but there is still more. And it all going to get 100x harder when we move across the country. I really want to just call it all off and have a small easy wedding with just family.

Lastly, his family doesn't know we are leaving yet. His mom, who doesn't seem to really approve of me as her future DIL anyway, is going to royally flip out. She's much more stressed about the wedding than we are. Which again, just makes me want to call the whole thing off. 

I'm just feeling sad today. And stressed. 
Oh and it's my birthday. Woo.

31,"You can't really be an expert in this field, but I've been dating online and offline for a while now. I'm not bad at it, I get positive responses, and I've gotten plenty of dates... in fact, if I can get a girl to chat with me, I can usually get her to meet up and at least find out if there's any chemistry. The chatting is the easy part. It **should** be the easy part, and being good with conversation online and offline should be a skill you build with everyone, not just women.

The big problems begin when things go well. Nothing is more frightening to the modern American woman than male interest and things going well. This could be for a number of reasons specific to the woman in question, but at her root, an iota of inferred interest can interrupt everything you've worked for. One never knows what level of interest a female is comfortable with: I only have my adventures to draw from, but it can literally be anything. One mistimed text message is all it takes. So the trick, and stay with me here, is to regulate your attention away from the unknowable. 

Let's try an example: It's Monday. What are **you** doing today? Any projects? Have you treated yourself to anything? What have **you** done for **you** today? What will **you** do for **you** today?

Using this thought process, you may find that you forget the woman you're dating even exists. Celebrate, when this happens! You have now matched the modern American woman dating mindset and are ready to proceed into a loveless, non-communicative relationship with a millennial who will never, ever, think of you as an equal either. 

You may also find that you have more money and less problems.

37,"So, I supervise a bunch of people from all walks of life. Regardless of their level of education, socioeconomic status, and blah blah, the one thing they all have in common is that they seem to think showing up for work and doing their respective jobs is optional.  To make matters worse, I work in the government, so   bureaucratic red tape prevents me from just firing people who don't show up. 

Today, I knew people were out so I was assigning others to different projects to try and fill the gaps. About 20 minutes later two people approached me and told me that one of the people I had assigned to do something wasn't here, and that his car was missing. I was surprised and said that they hadn't put in for an absence.  

I went off to report their absence to the bean counters, and this is when HR decided to make themselves known.  One of them overheard my conversation about that person not being in work, and decided to call me in to his office to tell me that I cannot talk about personnel matters with other employees. This seemed like a stretch, but I quelled my inner ""oh, go fuck yourself"" and nodded and left.

While I was doing that, those other two employees decided that since I didn't know about the absence they should check on their coworker. So they called. No answer. Texted. No answer. Repeat, repeat, repeat. No answer. Finally one of them sent a family member who they knew a message and asked that person to check on him.

Come to find out, that person shows up at the apartment and finds them asleep in their bed. However, they cannot wake them through banging on the bedroom window. So they go look for a super and explain the situation. After some back and forth she convinces the super to unlock the door so that she can yell in. They open the door and are smashed in the face by gas.

Rushing in to the apartment, they're able to rouse my employee enough to get him out of the apartment; although barely conscious. Cue up 911 and the natural gas folk. Building evacuation, all that.

It sounds like the person will be fine, and we all know the two people who decided to put their jobs on hold and reach out to their friend unrelentingly are the real heroes of the day.

 I'm buying them breakfast tomorrow, and I'm going to leave the empty doughnut box near the HR office. 

TL;DR I broke a rule and because of what I said two people saved someone else's life. 

EDIT: In the interest of full disclosure, if this reads as mildly annoyed it is because I initially posted this under TIFU with more emphasis on the HR office hassling me.

38,"While finishing up my taxes, I received an error message stating that the mileage used for going to and from work was invalid. This was the only thing that prevented me from hitting submit and filing my taxes. FAQs, tech support, all failed so I gave up to try another day. 

One day later, "" eh, I'll do it tomorrow.""

One month later, ""I'll just pay the late fee.""

One year later, ""I didn't file my taxes last year..shit.""

It was back in April 2014 when I last attempted to file my taxes like a good American citizen. 

In August 2014 was when I fell into this deep well of depression/anxiety that I am still trying to claw my way out of. 

In February/March 2015 I became too unstable to work in the only career I had known and went to college for. I burned a few bridges and had to slink away in shame. 

Summer 2015 is just a blur of whiskey and beer. 

November 2015 I got fired from my restaurant job and my partner left me (literally on the same day) so I moved 1400 miles back home where I could receive free healthcare due to my ethnicity. 

December 2015 I had a mental breakdown and was finally able to see a psychiatrist and therapist on the regular. I finally got on medication. 

April 2016 I got fired for having a panic attack. 

Summer 2016 was the best I had felt in two years. It was short lived.

November 2016 I noticed my therapist nodding off during my sessions. And my psychiatrist was judgemental and seemed uncaring at my concerns about medication. I became paranoid and stopped taking my meds. I barely got through the withdrawals. 

Today, April 3rd 2017. 
I'm still off my meds, unemployed, living with my father, and stuck in this fingernail-clawed well. 

I'm 28 years old, intelligent, talented, funny, attractive, and believe it or not, rational. I have food in my belly, a roof over my head, supportive family and friends, useful skills, a college degree, and a good work ethic.

Yet all I do every day is listen to podcasts because they keep my brain active by learning something or because they keep my brain silent from self-deprecating/Nihilistic/terrifying thoughts. I only go outside to take my precious dog on walks. I have $134 in my checking account, and $65 in my savings. That's $199 to my name. I had enough self control to stop my alcoholic ways and quit drinking, so I never go out to bars or have fun anymore. I do smoke cannabis, which helps me stay lucid when I feel like I'm slipping further down into Buffalo Bill's well. 

The only thing (besides my dog) that keeps me from putting serious thought into suicidal ideation is the fact that I am in the process of donating my kidney. Next week I have appointments to see if I am a healthy enough donor. If I can save someone else's life w my kidney, I can also save my own. My body is healthy, it's my brain that's sick. 

I have this gut feeling that if I can figure out a way to file all my taxes, I can start to get my life in order again. I'm afraid to sign up for Obamacare because I haven't done my taxes. There is even a fear of the IRS seeing this post and hunting me down. I know that's not how it works but anxiety doesn't accept anything but fear. 

If I can file my taxes, get on health insurance, find a therapist who cares about me, I will finally be able to climb out of this fucking awful well and back into reality. 

I just don't know how.
