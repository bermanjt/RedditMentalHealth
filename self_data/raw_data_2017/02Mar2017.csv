4,"Just throughout life in general, sometimes I wonder what I'm doing. It seems that there are so many people better qualified than myself to do the things I want to do, and when it comes to things I want to do, I feel like others have their heart in it much more than I do. Sometimes I think I lack the passion to be truly great at anything",02Mar2017,3
5,"It's only for a cashier at a local store and this is the first time I've ever applied for a real job. I'm 19 years old and this is the first job interview I'll have had. I'm happy that they got back to me and are giving me a chance, but I'm still really nervous about all of this. ",02Mar2017,3
8,"Before I get started, if this isn't the proper place to post this or if it should be cross-posted somewhere, please tell me!  I'm not new to Reddit, but this is a new account since a lot of this stuff should remain anonymous for the time being.  I plan to use this as a journal of sorts with the added benefit of crowd-sourcing advice, coping skills, and possibly even help in the form of neurological research or more ""out of the box"" ideas should anyone from relevant fields read this.  Who knows, there may even be someone else like this out there that could benefit from my story.  This is, in a way, my last hope.  

I currently have a headache.  Headaches are nothing new to me.  Since I was a child I would get the occasional headache.  They were so bad that I would often collapse and start crying.  I'm nearly 30 now and over the years the headaches have gone from ""once a week or so"" to ""a few times a day.""  I'm sure part of the cause for the headaches is the noise.  It's never quiet.  There is a constant cacophony bombarding me.  Some of it is external: the noise from the TV's power supply, the hum of the lights and power, the refrigerator constantly trying to evade capture.  Some of it's internal: my heartbeat, my breathing.  And some I'm not sure is real.  I can't tell anymore.  I haven't been able to for a while now.  There are four others in here, each of them with a voice and each of them seeming never to sleep.  Mal, Alice, Roth, and Jay.  These are my ""friends"", my tormentors, my confidants, my guards - whatever you want to call them.  I can lock them in the deepest dungeon of the great keep and still they will never stop.  Reality has reached a state of perpetual blur wherein I can no longer tell, independently, what is real to everyone else and what is real only to me.  

I used to get solace from sleeping but that didn't last beyond my early twenties.  Even in the darkest hole I can create Mal's screams and taunts echo of the walls.  His influence is ever present and pulls at me to throw myself into the darkness with him.  Alice is ever vigil, always trying to guide me to the correct path.  I appreciate her efforts, and she means well, but she will not rest.  She insists on ""keeping you safe, deary.""  Roth cannot be contained.  I can only hope to distract him while his mad ravings tire him out and keep him out of trouble.  I can't bear to look in on him for he is too painful a premonition of what I may yet become.  That leaves Jay.  Sweet, simple, slutty Jay.  He's happy to laze about and not cause trouble for the most part.  Like all rabbits he has claws but I've gotten him to a point where he can prevent himself from being overly excited - most of the time.  None of them can ever be allowed to take control again, except for Alice.  Mal must stay locked away.  He must never again be allowed to torment the world and the ones I love.  His darkness must never spread to reality again.  Roth and Jay must stay distracted and away from the control room at all costs, yet, they are too innocent to imprison.  Even Alice knows her key is only for use in times of dire need.  All sleeping does now is confine me to their reality and shatter the real world into pieces until I awaken only to weep that I awoke at all.

Arpineius and Junius relate to the lieutenants what they had heard. They, greatly alarmed by the unexpected affair, though those things were spoken by an enemy, still thought they were not to be disregarded; and they were especially influenced by this consideration, that it was scarcely credible that the obscure and humble state of the Eburones had dared to make war upon the Roman people of their own accord. Accordingly, they refer the matter to a council, and a great controversy arises among them. L. Aurunculeius, and several tribunes of the soldiers and the centurions of the first rank, were of opinion ""that nothing should be done hastily, and that they should not depart from the camp without Caesar's orders;"" they declared, ""that any forces of the Germans, however great, might be encountered by fortified winter-quarters; that this fact was a proof [of it]; that they had sustained the first assault of the Germans most valiantly, inflicting many wounds upon them; that they were not distressed for corn; that in the mean time relief would come both from the nearest winter-quarters and from Caesar; lastly, they put the query, ""what could be more undetermined, more undignified, than to adopt measures respecting the most important affairs on the authority of an enemy?""

In opposition to those things, Titurius exclaimed, ""That they would do this too late, when greater forces of the enemy, after a junction with the Germans, should have assembled; or when some disaster had been received in the neighboring winter-quarters; that the opportunity for deliberating was short; that he believed that Caesar had set forth into Italy, as the Carnutes would not otherwise have taken the measure of slaying Tasgetius, nor would the Eburones, if he had been present, have come to the camp with so great defiance of us; that he did not regard the enemy, but the fact, as the authority; that the Rhine was near; that the death of Ariovistus and our previous victories were subjects of great indignation to the Germans; that Gaul was inflamed, that after having received so many defeats she was reduced under the sway of the Roman people, her pristine glory in military matters being extinguished."" Lastly, ""who would persuade himself of this, that Ambiorix had resorted to a design of that nature without sure grounds? That his own opinion was safe on either side; if there be nothing very formidable, they would go without danger to the nearest legion; if all Gaul conspired with the Germans, their only safety lay in dispatch. What issue would the advice of Cotta and of those who differed from him, have? from which, if immediate danger was not to be dreaded, yet certainly famine, by a protracted siege, was.""

This discussion having been held on the two sides, when opposition was offered strenuously by Cotta and the principal officers, ""Prevail,"" said Sabinus, ""if so you wish it;"" and he said it with a louder voice, that a great portion of the soldiers might hear him; ""nor am I the person among you,"" he said, ""who is most powerfully alarmed by the danger of death; these will be aware of it, and then, if any thing disastrous shall have occurred, they will demand a reckoning at your hands; these, who, if it were permitted by you, united three days hence with the nearest winter-quarters, may encounter the common condition of war with the rest, and not, as if forced away and separated far from the rest, perish either by the sword or by famine.""

They rise from the council, detain both, and entreat, that ""they do not bring the matter into the greatest jeopardy by their dissension and obstinacy; the affair was an easy one, if only they all thought and approved of the same thing, whether they remain or depart; on the other hand, they saw no security in dissension."" The matter is prolonged by debate till midnight. At last Cotta, being overruled, yields his assent; the opinion of Sabinus prevails. It is proclaimed that they will march at day-break; the remainder of the night is spent without sleep, since every soldier was inspecting his property, [to see] what he could carry with him, and what, out of the appurtenances of the winter-quarters, he would be compelled to leave; every reason is suggested to show why they could not stay without danger, and how that danger would be increased by the fatigue of the soldiers and their want of sleep. At break of day they quit the camp, in a very extended line and with a very large amount of baggage, in such a manner as men who were convinced that the advice was given by Ambiorix, not as an enemy, but as most friendly [toward them].

But the enemy, after they had made the discovery of their intended departure by the noise during the night and their not retiring to rest, having placed an ambuscade in two divisions in the woods, in a suitable and concealed place, two miles from the camp, waited for the arrival of the Romans: and when the greater part of the line of march had descended into a considerable valley, they suddenly presented themselves on either side of that valley, and began both to harass the rear and hinder the van from ascending, and to give battle in a place exceedingly disadvantageous to our men.

Then at length Titurius, as one who had provided nothing beforehand, was confused, ran to and fro, and set about arranging his troops; these very things, however, he did timidly and in such a manner that all resources seemed to fail him: which generally happens to those who are compelled to take council in the action itself. But Cotta, who had reflected that these things might occur on the march, and on that account had not been an adviser of the departure, was wanting to the common safety in no respect; both in addressing and encouraging the soldiers, he performed the duties of a general, and in the battle those of a soldier. And since they [Titurius and Cotta] could less easily perform every thing by themselves, and provide what was to be done in each place, by reason of the length of the line of march, they ordered [the officers] to give the command that they should leave the baggage and form themselves into an orb, which measure, though in a contingency of that nature it was not to be condemned, still turned out unfortunately; for it both diminished the hope of our soldiers and rendered the enemy more eager for the fight, because it appeared that this was not done without the greatest fear and despair. Besides that happened, which would necessarily be the case, that the soldiers for the most part quitted their ensigns and hurried to seek and carry off from the baggage whatever each thought valuable, and all parts were filled with uproar and lamentation.

But judgment was not wanting to the barbarians; for their leaders ordered [the officers] to proclaim through the ranks ""that no man should quit his place; that the booty was theirs, and for them was reserved whatever the Romans should leave; therefore let them consider that all things depended on their victory. Our men were equal to them in fighting, both in courage and in number, and though they were deserted by their leader and by fortune, yet they still placed all hope of safety in their valor, and as often as any cohort sallied forth on that side, a great number of the enemy usually fell. Ambiorix, when he observed this, orders the command to be issued that they throw their weapons from a distance and do not approach too near, and in whatever direction the Romans should make an attack, there give way (from the lightness of their appointments and from their daily practice no damage could be done them); [but] pursue them when betaking themselves to their standards again.

Which command having been most carefully obeyed, when any cohort had quitted the circle and made a charge, the enemy fled very precipitately. In the mean time, that part of the Roman army, of necessity, was left unprotected, and the weapons received on their open flank. Again, when they had begun to return to that place from which they had advanced, they were surrounded both by those who had retreated and by those who stood next them; but if, on the other hand, they wish to keep their place, neither was an opportunity left for valor, nor could they, being crowded together, escape the weapons cast by so large a body of men. Yet, though assailed by so many disadvantages, [and] having received many wounds, they withstood the enemy, and, a great portion of the day being spent, though they fought from day-break till the eighth hour, they did nothing which was unworthy of them. At length, each thigh of T. Balventius, who the year before had been chief centurion, a brave man and one of great authority, is pierced with a javelin; Q. Lucanius, of the same rank, fighting most valiantly, is slain while he assists his son when surrounded by the enemy; L. Cotta, the lieutenant, when encouraging all the cohorts and companies, is wounded full in the mouth by a sling. ",02Mar2017,6
10,"My mood certainly isn't the same as it was [two weeks after](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/5ios8j/two_weeks_ago_i_tried_to_kill_myself/). I'm not as optimistic.

I'm not expecting to ever ""beat"" depression or anxiety. I'm not expecting to ever be cured of my insomnia. They're all just things that I'm going to have to learn to live with. Coexist, y'know? I've accepted that, so that's progress. ""Acceptance is the first and most important step"", as I was taught in the psych ward. Really though, I'm slowly accepting who I am and not letting these diseases define me. Slowly, but forward progress is still forward progress. Progress isn't always going upwards, there's bumps, like a graph of stocks. Maybe I'm just in a bump now.

There's still a lot I don't like. I don't like how the happiest moment of my life was me by a river with a rope around my neck and heaps of shit pumping through my veins. I don't like how inconsistent my motivation and energy are. I don't like how I'm on meds several times a day and can't function without them, doctors appointments every week and more every month. I don't like how I crave affection and companionship, or how I'm always paranoid about upsetting people. I don't like how spotty my memory has been since then. Definitely lost some brain cells.

I don't really know where I'm going with this. I guess I want an opinion from someone other than my therapist. I regret trying to kill myself because of how everyone reacted, but at the same time I don't really care that I survived. Like, I could take it or leave it. I'm totally apathetic to it and I don't know, that just feels wrong. Everything about me feels slightly wrong.

She said she wants to die and I'm thinking she just has a self-depreciation type of humor...you know. So I go along with it like ""oh what a good 1 I've stumbled across""

She said she really wants to die, is legitimately suicidal, and wants to die like this week some time. I didn't know how to feel at this point.

She asked me ""why do you want to die""....""I saw you want to die in your bio and hoped we could talk about it""

At this point, I've started to get serious...I told her ""you've got me feeling some type of way right now""

She replied with multiple ?'s. I say ""yes let's talk about it""

No reply.

When she got busy I'd get upset that I wouldn't be able to see her during the day. Not getting texts back after so much time. I started to jump to conclusions about everything. Started overthinking. Everything she felt and did was so important to me. I always saw myself with her in my life. But it got to the point where she couldn't handle me and shit I would do.

28,"So today I was told that I have melanoma. From all the places at the right side of my head.

A little backstory. When I was 11 I was diagnosed with bone cancer (osteosarcoma). For 4 years I was on and off of the treatment (surgery and chemo). Until I was 16 I went through 3 surgeries and same amount of chemos. Last was resulting in amputation of my left leg above the knee. 

When I was 17 I was diagnosed with melanoma on my back. Thankfully only surgery was sufficient.

For 7 years I live with fear of cancer. But when finally I thought “maybe it really is gone”… About 3 weeks ago I had 2 moles removed due to a possible risk. Today I got a call from my doc saying they found 2nd stage melanoma in the one removed from my head. So to top the cancer thing I will have to live rest of my life (don’t know how long it will be :) ) with a huge scar on my head. As they will do a second surgery to remove way more tissue around where mole was. 

I cried few minutes before deciding to write this post. I hate everything and everyone in this god forsaken world. I just don’t thing that this will end… I am sure that I will die from cancer sooner or later. I even thought that maybe I should refuse treatment. I don’t know. Just wanted to write this stuff.
