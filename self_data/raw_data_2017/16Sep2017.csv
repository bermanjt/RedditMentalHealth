Im a recent graduate looking to embark on a career ( but  not sure what in!)
I have been offered a job at a start up, my worries are that its a small team (10) the founders are very young ( under 25) and feels quite different from anything I've ever done. The salary isnt what i Wanted either, but I have no other options. 
Anyone been in similar situations? Anyone got life advice in general.
The job would require me to move out of my hometown, and Im a little scared of entering the big wide world ( ashamed to admit that)",16Sep2017,2
3,"But my last dude definitely convinced me I'm a lot less attractive than I thought. And he's probably right. But now I'm really sad about it. I thought I was a decently cute girl and now I'm walking around thinking how average I am, how I'll never find someone to date, how lonely I am and how lonely I'll keep being. I'm really alone without him, but he was so good at making me feel bad... before him I thought I was a catch. But if I was a catch someone would have wanted to stay with me. ",16Sep2017,2

7,"Of the four people I was talking the most with at the beginning of the year, I am now only on speaking terms with one of them, and I have recently stopped responding to her texts. The first three people cut me out of their lives one by one but this last girl has stuck with me the whole time and now Im cutting myself off from her. Im not exactly sure why. Maybe its because shes not a very good person (neither am I but still) or maybe its because at this point I want to be alone on some level. Who knows. Im so lonely all the time but its also oddly liberating in a way to be free of everyone elses troubles. Im hard pressed to describe my true feelings or motivation. Somewhere between a desperate desire for human contact and an even stronger desire to wall myself off from everyone.",16Sep2017,2
8,"I recently graduated and attained my associate's degree in business management.  During my last semester, I had an internship.  Upon graduating, I naively thought I might possibly be able to find a full-time position that paid the same or better as my internship with benefits.  I graduated in May and since then have applied to roughly 100 positions and have had a half-dozen interviews for full-time positions.  I have not had an offer for a full-time position as of yet, but I have found another part-time job that I just started recently.  The hours I'm getting at the job are below what I expected, but I'm glad I have an additional part-time job.  

I'm currently back in school for computer science, learning Spanish, and using the Lumosity application.  Computer science is a bit tough for me, but I know if I use office hours, study well, and possibly get a tutor(s) I can get through it.  My question is, upon getting my associate's degree in computer science, will I be eligible for a full-time position with benefits?  I have done some looking and it looks like most of the positions I see in my area require an associate's degree and 1 year of experience.  I'm concerned that getting an associate's degree in computer science will have the same impact on my career as my business management degree which is unfortunately not much help. 

I am from Generation X and have held full-time positions in the past.  I'm glad I went back to school and I'm trying to continue to further my education, but so far it is not helping much.  I'm concerned for my future.  How am I going to pay my bills and support myself?  Realistically, I'm guessing I may end up working several part-time jobs with no benefits and barely making ends meet.

11,"Wikipedia tells you that Insecurity means ""uncertainty or anxiety about oneself; lack of confidence"". What it doesn't tell you that it can be all encompassing, and grips onto all that you do.

My personal definition of insecurity is my appearance. All my life I've been a scrawny little twat. I'm 25, but I look like I'm 15. Much thinner than my friends, and I *hate* it. For those of you who're about to say ""oh you should love yourself"". Fuck you, I've tried. Sorry, I know you mean well, but it's hard to argue against a mirror.

It manifested itself slowly, but really picked up the pace in college. I didn't think much of it at first; though I did notice that I had to work much harder for people to like me than my friends. My belief in my looks being the issue was subtly reinforced with every occurrence. Now, whenever I meet someone new, I'd instinctively assume that I leave a negative impression to start. I did this almost subconsciously.

Now, it's gotten to the point that I can't believe that people can actually like me. I keep conversations brief because I imagine that I'm boring. I decline my friend's invitations because I imagine that they're looking for a replacement for someone. The feeling of inadequacy completely subjugated my social life. All without me knowing.

This all came to light when I finally cheesed off one of my friends. She asked why I avoid contact with her for no reason, and that I constantly have a guard up when I speak to her. Many of my other friends agreed.

In the end, I just want to apologise to all my amazing friends who's been there for me and having to put up with my shit. I don't know how long (if ever) it will take for me to overcome my fears, but I'll definitely make an effort. And Q, I love you and there's no way I'd ever intentionally push you away. We all all meeting for lunch tomorrow-see you all there.",16Sep2017,15
12,"This may be obvious to many people but if you're a guy on reddit and have been exposed to some ""redpill"" style relationship advice; You may want to keep reading and seriously consider some of the implications of that philosophy. There is stuff in that sphere that does make sense and does work very consistently. Things like self improvement, dieting and developing a sense of confidence that is grounded in reality (confidence because you do your job well or you feel confidant because you are capable of handling what life throws your way). But that useful information is delivered with advice that will degrade your relationships over time and will ultimately lead you down a path that you most likely don't want to go down.

If you are just aiming to be a player and hook up with a lot of girls then this advice works; you're using a hammer to pound a nail. This style of dating however **does not work in relationships that you intend to last longer than a week**. If you find that it is working it's because the person you are dating has some serious self of esteem issues. Techniques that give the illusion that you may leave at any time or to deflate someones ego into thinking they can't do any better can only really work on someone who is significantly insecure about themselves. There are theory's in TRP that are dependent on the ideas that women are basically immoral, hypergamus and manipulative so it's therefore ok for you to also be manipulative. People who subscribe to that see it as a kind of *self defense.*

Now im out of a relationship that lasted  7 years and looking back I don't even want to call it a relationship. It's more accurate to call it a 7 year *interaction*, it was heartbreaking how meaningless it was. There was a long period in my life where I generally fucked up everything, dragged my feet through school and in life.  I was seriously under-preforming what I  thought I was capable of. This led to a huge inferiority complex and a host of self esteem issues which made it easy for me to get into TRP in the first place. Speaking from experience, had I spent my time trying to improve my lot in life I would not have been on reddit the 8 hours a day to find TRP to begin with. But as I got into it, my life started to get better. I was convinced; I implemented advice and it **WORKED**. 

I don't want to talk down to you and just say ""TRP is bad, never go there kiddo"". Of course it's bad, but having been sucked into it myself I believe that just telling people ""it's bad"" and then not elaborating why in an honest way makes it even more appealing to people. In psychology it's called the boomerang effect. What makes TRP *ideologically acidic* is the assumption that women are unbelievably selfish and view men as a utility. If that sentence were something along the lines of ""*Many people* are unbelievably selfish and view *others* as a utility"" then it would be more correct. They use statistics and studies that reaffirm this view, i'm not going to debunk all of it (i can't) but the marriage statistics deserve a mention. If you look at the divorces initiated by women over all it's around 70%, very significant. The TRP hypothesis is that it's so high because of women's hypergamy or immorality ect. However, if you consider that statistically men are the bread winners and generally have most of the resources; they have more to lose in a divorce and therefore be unlikely to initiate divorce in the first place(hence the 20%). I agree with them that half of all marriages *fail*, but don't be so eager to blame women's nature. The underlying theme with TRP is that *women are essentially trying to extract value from you through your status and wallet*. If you end up on their board and passively read what they have to say, that theme seeps in and becomes apart of your world view. You become bitter or depressed that the world isn't like a Disney movie, they call this ""the red pill rage"" phase. People going through this phase make up a majority of the posters on TRP, that's why if you go there right now it's almost all negatively charged posts about women or self improvement discussions. In my opinion if your one of reddit's stereotypical ""nice guys"" this kind of shock and disillusion could probably  help you. But this passive consumption does more damage in the over time because shunts the responsibility of all your romantic problems onto women alone. This leads to a kind of loop where it's never your fault for getting into these toxic relationships repetitively. The world is a chaotic place and socially it is impossible to completely understand, **TRP hasn't figured it all out**. Advice from people on the internet about this stuff isn't going to help you. You need to pull from your own experience and make decisions for yourself. **People who are leading the life you want are not on TRP dispensing ""bio-truths""**, those people probably live next door and you're too busy wasting time here to just go talk to them. People love giving advice, it makes them feel valuable; just look at all this bullshit I wrote for nothing.

16,"Today is a national holiday in my country. Everyone I know is out celebrating and having a great time. I just can't stand anymore being around them, feeling like I'd rather be alone. 

This, I don't mind, but I just can't remember the last time I was with someone and felt accompanied. I've begun to not give a fuck about my friends and family. Most of them have stopped seeing how much I try, and have just become apathetic and seem to think everything I do must be good. They completely lack any sort of sympathy for how much I put myself through to do shit that no-one else can. They just know I can, and don't give a shit whether I do it comfortably or am suffering.

I'm not suicidal. I haven't been for years; happiness has been in my life in the last year after a huge fight with depression. I haven't cared about being alone, I'm normally fine with having myself as company. The things I love doing have suddenly been disappearing from my life. I no longer have the money to go out, to pay for gym or buy myself something, anything I want. Time's a lot scarcer since I've had to do all kinds of shit work, too. 

There's no one I care about anymore: they've all left me as much as I've left them. My family has been a massive ball of shit. They've always been. My friends are superficial, and so have I been in choosing them. I used to feel a spark whenever I worked in audio, yet it has slowly begun vanishing since I've discovered I have such incredible ideas, the sounds made of infinite detail that are drilled into my brains everyday, that I imagine so lucidly in my dreams and have stored so temporarily in ny memory, are some that I can't and ever won't plaster into reality.

I am not as talented as I want to be, and even with the thousands of hours that I've dedicated towards learning, I am but a fraction of the man I've longed being. I feel incomplete. I feel like I've left the one or two people whom I've loved to get better at the things that I used to live for. The fire has slowly been put out by myself.

I've become the cold ashes of the red-hot ember I was, and feel like the souls of everyone around me left and they became functional yet empty husks of the men and women that I looked up to. I can't relate anymore.

I don't want to be depressed ever again. I have to start caring once again because, if I were to become woefully depressed again, I would not be able to comr back to me.

I may not need to stop being alone, but I HAVE to stop feeling lonely.

19,"About 10 years ago it was such that having a bowl of cereal and milk was a trade off that costed me horrible shits and a couple days of bloating and gas.  So I switched to almond or cashew milk and resigned myself to the fact that this was my life.

Occasionally I'd cheat but at some point it just wasn't worth it and so I gave up on dairy completely (except for cheese, which for whatever reason didn't seem to affect me).

Well the other day I had the opportunity to eat cocoa pebbles, and being that this was my favorite cereal as a kid, the temptation and nostalgia was just too strong.  

I braced myself for horrible shits and gas and then...nothing.  Since then I've been eating cereal and milk and ice cream and whatever other dairy I want and I haven't had any problems.

28,"I'm almost 30 years old and have sunk into my deepest form of depression. With limited family, almost no close friends, and now being broken up with my boyfriend in an ideal situation - I feel completely lost and purposeless. Nothing motivates me to get out of bed.

I'm been seeing a therapist, but I don't feel like it's helping. Some days I just lay on my bathroom floor and cry and until I'm so tired that I then lay in my bed. I'm constantly alone. 

I can't say I haven't thought about suicide - it crosses my mind a lot these days. But I don't think I could ever actually go through it. 

But I have been thinking about ""just disappearing"". I just want to plan an escape - I want to quit my corporate job and not tell a single soul where I go. I imagine that I will feel 'cleansed' and leave any bad memories and my old self behind.

32,"i hate myself.

i am 28 years old, female, single, childless. 

the first reason i hate myself is ugliness. i am tall for a woman and each of my features is the opposite of what is attractive. i have a flat chest and flat ass but wide, misshapen violin hips. my legs are chunky. i'm bottom heavy. my inner labia are large and revolting. my hair is completely grey - some genetics, some stress. i have to dye it very regularly to hide this. my skin is also very dry so i already have wrinkles. i can't seem to lose any more weigh no matter how hard i try so i am hefty in all the wrong places at 140lbs. i feel enormous and masculine. nobody will ever want me.

the second reason i hate myself is that i am evil and ill. i can't fully define what this is, but safe to say that i can't think any good thoughts. i want to be a good person - funny, kind and nice to be around but i am none of those things. i can't trust my own behaviour with others. i get insecure and act impulsively and i don't feel in control of myself. two years ago i cheated on a long term partner during one of these impulsive episodes and i have been unable to forgive myself since. every day i just think about killing myself because i hate myself and cannot trust myself. i no longer pursue relationships with other people. i am lonely, but this is justice. i guess i can take some comfort in knowing at least that means point 1 doesn't actually matter since it wouldn't be right for someone to want me.

i hate myself because i have nothing to show for myself. i tried to live independently following the break-up i caused but was unable to do so. i was unable to rent a room because i suffered from paranoid thoughts that my landlord was going to hurt me. i was unable to carry on working full time because i was having panic attacks and suicidal thoughts at work. now, i am unemployed back living in my mums house at 28 years old!!!!! i am deeply, deeply ashamed. due to my spotty work history and lack of any kind of career, i will now never have a respectable job. i have nothing at all. i am a failure in every single aspect of my life. 

i have nothing to show for myself and no reason to keep living. i want nothing more than to die. the only thing stopping me is that i don't want to hurt my parents even more than i have done already by being such a disgusting unlovable disappointment and burden.",16Sep2017,3
33,"I've been living in a college townhouse for just under a month, with 4 other randomly assigned roommates. Three of these people are just normal dudes, however the fourth is extremely strange and this makes living with him very uncomfortable.

He's an extreme clean freak. Of course everyone appreciates sanitation when living in a communal house, however he has made it his business to make sure that our common room shows no sign of human life. If you leave a personal item on the coffee table or put your shoes next to the door, he will take those things and leave them at your bedroom door. The fridge is constantly rearranged by him, seemingly at no pattern. Speaking of fridges, just today he brought in a gigantic, beat up, smelly refrigerator to store raw hunted venison. It is alright for that refrigerator (which he says only he is allowed to use) to take up a major portion of our already limited living space, however a backpack or a cup on the table is unacceptable.

He's very insensitive. He eavesdropped on a phone conversation of mine in which I was discussing my struggle with depression. The next day when I mention I'm gonna live it up that night, he says ""I thought you didn't want to live""?

Last night though, my friend came over and he brought some LSD. My roommate asked us what our plans were, and we told him we were gonna do acid. He says to us ""Hey, my *mom* is in the other room"". Turns out his mother is staying here all weekend, and he didn't feel the need to let anyone know. Secondly though, why the fuck would I care about his mother's sensibilities regarding drugs? I'm an adult in my own home and she can shove whatever opinions she may have about what I'm doing with my night.

Anyway, his mommy has basically spent all day today hanging around the house and watching TV. She complained about me burning sage in my room because she thought it was marijuana, and she asked me ""how I was raised"". Nothing like receiving petty judgement from some crusty old bitch who is spending the weekend in your living room unannounced.

I really don't know where I'm going with this but this dude is seriously one of the strangest people I've ever met. He thinks he's in the military even though he's only former ROTC. He never stops talking about how much he wants to fuck black girls. He can't keep his lies about his sex life straight. For example, he called me a loser for never having had anal only a few nights after he drunkenly confessed that he's had sex only once. However he will still tell you about all the crazy hookups he's had without blinking twice.
He was actually complaining about my friend and I watching TV at 9 pm on a Friday and expressed his (and his mommy's) disgust at the sight of us using illegal drugs. He's only 20 but drinking for him is A-OK. He's the ultimate cockblock and is an immediate buzzkill. During a party, he will start doing dishes.
