I don't know why, but I keep getting rejected. I've followed advice about being confident and smooth and I've been applying it. Most of the time I try to establish a rapport and then I just ask if they'd like to get  cup of coffee or go out etc. I've gotten more confident, got a job, am focusing on a lot of other things besides women but I still would like a girlfriend. I've been rejected by more girls than I can count and I just don't know why. Could it be my looks:

I don’t feel like any places near me suit me job wise, however I don’t know if I’m looking thoroughly enough. I’m having trouble using Indeed and Monster because I cannot find anything specific for a student looking for a part-time job. 

I have money saved up from my grandparents and my mom said I can buy my cousins car for around $2500-$3000. She said I need a job by the end of September and I need to pay for the insurance/gas (or at least a majority of it), meaning I need a job. 

-I live in the Southeast US

-Looking to work around 15 hours a week

-Don’t care about $/hr for now

-Would be my first job 

-Looking for any sites or businesses to help in my job search

Any help is appreciated! ",31Aug2017,1
3,"When I was in the 4th grade, I lived directly across the street from my school. In fact, I was even directly across from my classroom, but that really doesn't matter, aside from it being a place my grandma sat to listen in the morning I did the pledge.

Every day we said the pledge of allegiance. It was always recited over the intercom. I don't know if kids say it directly to a statutory flag or if they say it together with a video tape of two students like we used to at Hunter Hills in Kentucky. I don't know how they do it anymore. 

When this happened, I lived in California, as I do now.

But once a week or maybe every day (I don't remember anymore), they'd select an ""outstanding"" student to recite the pledge over the intercom for the entire school. It was generally just a student who had a good score on a test or read a buttload of library books. 

I was selected once. I did fine. I recited it perfectly. 

I distinctly remember that after every recital of the PoA, the principal would then say something like ""That was [student] from [room] leading the pledge of allegiance. Everyone make sure to give [him/her] a big pat on the back.""

Everything had gone perfectly, right up until the last word, when he said ""butt"" by mistake. 

""Everyone make sure to give him a big pat on the butt.""

My classmates were merciless. At the time I was so embarrassed, but I look back on it now and laugh my ass off. This bitch really said ""pat him on the butt.""

That guy later pulled a Mr. Feeny and became my middle school principal as well as my high school (for the time I was there) principal. He was (I guess) largely successful in the district and they sort of shuffled him everywhere. Genuinely a great guy who ruined my school day so bad that I was happy when I heard (a week later) that I was moving to Kentucky.",31Aug2017,2
4,"Hello Reddit, throwaway cause the subject knows my main account.

So for backstory, I've been best friends with a girl for a few years now. And she's helped me through a lot recently (past two months), helping me out of a toxic relationship and the mindset it caused. We're pretty close, and there's almost no topics off bounds. But, I can't talk to her about this, and I don't have anyone else to talk to.

...I think I have some sort of feelings for her, and I know I can't do anything about it. I don't think they're realistic, since I know it would never work; we have different goals, different interests, not to mention I'm kind of a horrible person. It's not like I *can't* get with her, I just plain ***shouldn't.***

She's been in a relationship with a guy who's helped her like she helped me, and they're almost engaged. I'm happy to see her happy, and I'm amicable with her boyfriend. I have no desire to sabotage that for what would definitely be nothing more than a fling. 

But I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I feel like I did when I was ghosted in my first relationship. It's a horrible tugging feeling inside, and I just want it to go away.

Can I get any clarity on this? I'm sorry if this isn't the right subreddit, I'm not used to subreddits like this.",31Aug2017,1

On Tuesday a convoy of food and supplies is leaving Las Vegas for Houston organized by Tim Trendell. He has close friends in Huston who will be keeping Tim  up to date as to where the best destination for the convoy  will be when it arrives.

This effort is in its early stages, but Tim has already collected a lot of food, water and supplies for the residents desperately in need in Houston, but is striving to get much more. He is attempting to line up CDL drivers and the money to rent Tractor Trailers if needed. More space until Tuesday to store these supplies may also be needed.

Right now Tim has lined up a nine foot high van, a thirty five foot trailer and a rental truck for the journey and is reaching out to people in Phoenix and Tuscon to join the convoy as it passes through.

I'm going to college in town, so they want me to stay and live with them for expenses. I'm really scared of money currently but I know for certain I don't want to live with them after I graduate.

11,"Hi, I'm a 14 year old guy and I think my parents are overprotective. For instance, once i wanted to go to the local park at 7:30 pm and they said that I might get raped or kidnapped. Every single time I want to go anywhere by myself that is even .00001 percent dangerous, they tell me I'll get raped or killed. I'm not young enough to where I believe this shit. I'm really tired of it. The park I wanted to go to was literally .2-.3 miles away. You just have to go down the street. My neighborhood is very friendly, it's like a plaza. Anyways, I know I'm still a teeny tiny bit young to go out on my own, but I should start. Its absolute bs. Also, I like to think I have decently healthy habits. I eat healthy, have a daily routine (based off of Ben franklins) and exercise. Also, if I want to go out near dark, they tell me the same exact thing. I wake up at 5, and this morning at 6 I went to that same park without my parents knowing. I told them after, because what can they do anyway. My mom, swear to god, says its okay. At 6 in the morning, but not 7:30 at night. Come on. They are actually a little fair, they let me go to the local plaza during the day (.5 miles) but going ANYWHERE at night, fuggedaboutit. Another stupid thing; Everytime I want to go to my friends house, she has to plaN it. It's basically a playdate. Back to the park thing; I keep trying to explain to her that it's not fun nor rational. Every time I do she complains about stress and makes me feel guilty. I really want to break the rules but I'm afraid. I'm posting on here to get a response from a sane parent.

12,"The road me and my family live on is built somewhat higher than the highway (which is underwater as of right now) near our road. My father and my stepmother have been saving up for an actual house, but as of right now we live in a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom trailer with one room full of junk. It is by no means a big house, especially considering they have three kids (me and two siblings, though we have quite the age gap). 

Ever since the whole Harvey business started my Dad has really been such a kind man. We go to the grocery store every 2 days to check on people. If they need help with groceries (since shopping carts can't make it out the front entrance) we load them up in our truck and bring them to their vehicle. He gives them cash if they really need it for gas or such. So far we have been able to take two families in. He's been posting on Facebook asking if anyone needs a place to stay or if they need a ride somewhere or whatever they need.

He's also been leaving at midnight to go help rescue people. A bunch of people from my small town all get their boats together and go searching. So incredible. 

Just an appreciation post for him and everyone helping during this time.

p.s. our front yard makes for a really fun area to walk around in just for the he'll of it. If you're yard is flooded and its not too windy I'd suggest trying it, but not right now because its almost midnight lol",31Aug2017,1

22,"I am in my late 20's. Want to work but not really. I can safely call myself deeply heartbroken and emotionally numb by things not very far away in the past. It's like I don't want to know what _good_ is left there for me to experience in order to maintain this vessel. I am working at a place I didn't really went to an interview for. They picked me up casually and am being paid very less. Insultingly less.

Know that I am capable of doing much better. It's just that I'm not inspired to do so. 

Okay. So today my friend suggested me a job switch with a better pay. Went for the interview. Very first of its kind. So…

I couldn't promise anything. I wasn't excited or really interested from the heart. They asked me _""why you wanna do this job?""_ and I don't even want to remember what I said. And i am feeling like I'm forced into all of this employment and currency world where my reasons are fear induced. And it hurts my being inside. I feel like I know what being raped would feel like. It would be just like this. 

So tomorrow is going to be a 'demo day'. And I don't really wanna go. But it is higher pay and also my friend is involved. And I remember knowing this very well in the past that my life afterwards those emotional blows is going to be zombie like.

31,"Hello, my fellow Redditors!  

I hope Reddit-land has revealed its current treasures to you. In this ever-darkening world, we need those precious, glinty gems that make our hearts smile.


Obligatory: “I'll apologize upfront for any mistakes, as I'm writing *and* formatting in mobile. I don't have a computer right now.”


This post is meant to serve as an opportunity for me to share with you a teensy bit about my life, and additionally, to share about something that has, more recently, happened to me. My primary (albeit selfish) reason is to perhaps clear my head. Or just word-vomit and vent to the willing eyes. To your eyes.


I *don't* know what I'm doing.  

I *don't* know why I'm writing.  

I *don't* know what it means.  


I could only hope that ***you***, my *beloved reader*, may extract from this what you need at *this. very. moment.* That what you read may reveal a thing you didn't know you needed to read. A thing you might tuck away in your pocket for later. A glinty gem you can shine a light on.


And so..  

Here goes..  

My story?


I'm not quite sure where to begin. I won't reveal too many very personal details. I will spare you the massive wall of text (though as I write and proofread, I quickly realize this is becoming precisely that)


I'll begin by telling you, internet strangers, a smidge about your author: me!


I am a twenty-six year-old male. I have plentiful doubts about my self-image.  

I have been called: handsome, sexy, cute, skinny, big, weak, strong, weird, perfect, loud, quiet, little, short, muscled, tan, talented, hot, ditzy, kind, wise, old souled, courageous, afraid, introverted, outgoing, shy, and thoughtful.. Amongst other particularly nasty things.  

I overthink *everything* in my life, yet tend to lead with my heart and my everything-else follows.


Does that get me into trouble? *Oh yeah*.


But it's worth it


My most recent escapade currently lends itself to the top of my ever expanding, never boring collection-case of moments. Real moments. Real feelings. Gritty life realizations. Those perfectly imperfect twists in time that seemingly can *only* be purposed to create a better infrastructure on which our lives are built. The infrastructure that holds our guilts, lies, truths and love.  

Now, before we get to what I *really* came here to say, let me tell you… where I've been:


I came from a bad place. A place of demons.


I was an emotional mess. I put myself through hell. Something inside me broke. I had been hurt in ways I didn't know it was possible to feel pain. Kicked in the shins of my heart. The throat of my meaning had been slit.  

Mentally, I couldn't justify a lot of things. A lot of good things. They just *didn't matter.*  

Love. Happiness. Friendships. Life.  

It was difficult.  

I often wish I knew what kept me going. Perhaps it was my friends. My fraternal brothers. It may have been my family. Maybe it was my employer.  

I shamefully had abandoned God.


During this dark time, I had managed to move to a new place. I upended my life after all was said and done. I left my family. *My constant.* I dragged my belongings to where I was lured north with the flashy promises of spectacular things. Potential career paths, endless opportunities, beautiful town, a desire for any hope that could change my defeated heart.  

My naivety got the best of me. Those promises were broken. Those people became enemies. Enemies I worked with. People who tried to make me feel worthless.   I had had enough.


I quit.


I began to run my own business.  

I taught children.  

I delivered food.  

I mattered.  

Life mattered.  


Soon after, the eyes of my soul had reopened, I was proud of myself. I began to feel complete again. I felt my justifications were rooted in reality. I meant what I felt and I knew it was real.   

However, I quickly came to the daunting realization of where I was. Where I ended up. This place, to which I now belonged, had abounding hate. Lost souls. Alcoholism. Racial tensions. Murder.  

There was *very* little for single twenty-something year-olds to do. It was a lonely place. I desperately needed out. But… out to where? I was committed. I was running a business! I owed people money! I owed my students their education! I was successful! Where was I supposed to go!?  

To where I was? That place I came from?  

No!!  

I couldn't go back to that. I was still crawling out of that hellish nightmare. My feet were still kicking those damning thoughts that grasped and clawed at my ankles.


I found my escape.


And so, I escaped.


I discovered my addiction. I realized my bliss. I found a reason to be okay. It was so… *easy.* 


My business suffered. Relationships suffered. I began a new war. I conquered the last, if only just barely.  

I began a war of justifications. That I was okay. That ***it*** was okay. **It** wasn't hurting anyone.. *right?*  

By the throat **it** grabbed me. It's nasty, dark nails dug deep. Broke my flesh and sent me deeper. I was lost.


My desperate heart cried out for help


My mind began to hear. To listen. Something needed to change. I began to surround myself with people who loved me. 


I tried to quit. I did okay. With their help I managed. I never told anyone about my struggle. It haunted me. It made me wonder who I was. It made me afraid of who I might become.


I'll take this moment to pause... It seems pretty heavy. I make it sound like I'm only telling you the bad stuff. Mostly because I am. It wasn't *all* bad. There were beautiful moments. Real moments. Life changing epiphanies. World rocking truths. I met some of the best people in my life. It was over the course of five years or so that my life seemed so out of control. I make it seem like I went forth with reckless abandon, that depression had consumed my soul.  

It did. But I lived with it. I was “okay.” I managed a somewhat normal life… so back to my story.


It became time. Time to be okay. It was time to arm myself with the weapons necessary to win back my life. I had to fight.  

I began to assess my life and the things that were making me feel the way I felt. I kicked my addiction (mostly), I filled my life with love. I began to surround myself with people who fought alongside me. I didn't have to be alone.


It was then, I began to forgive.


I forgave myself.  

I forgave those that broke me.  

I was free.  


I stopped allowing myself to be controlled by others. By the way they treated me. The harsh words they had spoken to me. They were no longer allowed to hurt me.


The instant you allow someone to make you feel anything but a better version of yourself, you are no longer in control of your feelings. Of *your own* heart.  

Forgive them.  

Take back your heart.  

It belongs to ***you***


**You.**


I took a promotion and moved one step closer to my escape. I gathered my belongings and moved further south. Closer to where I needed to be.


I began to heal. I allowed myself to heal.


After another year, I then moved home. To be with my family. I needed them.


After I spent a month with my family I moved 3,000 miles away.


I was scared. I didn't know what I was doing. Where I was going. But I knew it wasn't where I was. I was never going back. 


When I arrived I found a home. My soul began to smile. I grew. Emotionally. Mentally. Spiritually.  

I accepted God back into my heart.  

The empty spaces were full.  

I began to learn so many things about myself and the power I have in Christ I bawled in front of a hundred people. They were there for me. I defeated my addiction.


I began to challenge myself. I began to do the very things that scared me. They scared me to death, and I conquered them. Small things. Big things. Things I never thought I'd do. Things I did because I wanted to. To simply prove to myself that I could. I stepped out of my comfort zone, and I made my life happen.


I began to love unconditionally. Because it scared me.  

I began to listen to others.  

I did things that made my heart race.  

I helped everyone I could.  

I started talking to strangers.  

I started loving strangers. 

I was invincible. 

Love awakens love. 


This is where I get to the part I wanted to tell you (way back at the beginning, I ramble much, yeah?)


I started to post pictures online. I had never done it before. It was a fear of mine. I found a safe environment and began to challenge my beliefs and my fears. I posted a lot. I got a lot of feedback and wonderful comments.  

My heart was big.  

My confidence grew.  

I loved so much.  

I had been so many places.  

I had grown so much.  

I knew what my life had become..  

I was happy.


That's when I got a message.


It was a nice message. I checked the user's posts. Gorgeous. Big, pretty eyes. She was really good looking, and had nice things to say. She loves when I brag about her. So I'm going to brag about her. In a way that would probably make ^her ^uncomfortable.


So I messaged back.  

It snowballed, she gave me her number and we began to text.  

I couldn't believe it.  

I met a really cool girl online and she was talking to me. She was interested in me. She cared about me. I cared about her. 


Texting turned into talking. I once again conquered my fears (telephobia this time) and called her on the phone. For many weeks we talked every day. For hours. We never ran out of things to talk about. She was absolutely perfectly her. I loved it.  

I loved her.


It seemed so right. She loved the things I called her. The way I talked. She thought I was handsome. Things I just did normally were her favorites. For once in my life, someone loved me for who I was. I didn't have to change. I didn't have to pretend. I was.. me.  

She was her.  

She sometimes told me she wasn't my type, or that she didn't think I liked how she looked or something about her body. But I didn't care. I wanted her just the way she was. Because she was perfectly her. She had a beautiful body, nice breasts, a great bum. And those legs! It mattered more to me who she was, then what was or wasn't attached to her.


We shared moments. Powerful moments. Overwhelming feelings. Real truths. I told her things I had never told anyone before. She shared her life with me. I shared mine. It was real. Raw. Genuine. Authentic.


We decided to meet.  

But it became too real.  

It fell apart.  

I guess we are no more.  

It was over.  


I don't know if I did something. Or if I said something. Or if I didn't do the right thing.  

It was so hard for me to hear.


But it was worth it. I may never know what I really, truly, meant to her. And depending on what she feels... I may not ever speak to her again. All I know is that she changed me.


She helped me heal. She showed me that I *could* love again. *Real* love. That it was okay to love. It was okay to be vulnerable. She exemplified my forgiveness of the people that broke me. I had, indeed, freed my heart from the chains I placed around it. It was scary. And powerful.  


I know in my bones that I am so grateful for the time that I had shared with her. I don't know what the future holds, or if she will decide to be in it, but I'm glad she was there for me. I'm glad she let me love her. She knows I'm always here for her. And that's the truth. I will never stop loving. And feeling. And being real. Until we look inside ourselves and free ourselves from our brokenness, love will hurt.


My willingness to do what is necessary to be real may have been too much. 


And that's okay.


My heart aches. It was only a short amount of time yet, I feel like I lost a best friend. I don't know if we'll talk again. I don't know if she'll find this.. Or read this. Perhaps my creating this has sealed my fate. I don't know if she still cares.


And that's okay.


My feelings will run their course.  


I have to respect my boundaries.


Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance.


And so, *dear reader,* you've made it this far.  

I thank your willing eyes. Your attention has given my post meaning. Maybe all it does is make you smile. That's a win in my book. It means so much that you'd read this far. We've all got a life in front of us, directions to choose. People come, and people go. You will always be learning. Experiencing. And so, there are things I’d like to share.


With you.


You… are *worth* it. 


Don't you ***dare*** let anyone tell you otherwise; let anyone make you ***feel*** otherwise. You cannot control how people think or what they feel. You cannot make someone love *you* or *anyone* else. 


So for heaven's sake, fill your heart with love! Forgive those people who have done things to your heart. Let them *go.* Take control of your heart. Unlock those chains and feel it! Your past is your past. You are given the opportunity to grow. 

Right here.  

Right now.


You have *been blessed* with **every** spiritual blessing:  

love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Nothing can stop you. There is no physical limitation to being and sharing these blessings.


You are made for incredible things. That path in front of you is waiting for you. Surround yourself with people who care. People who will fight alongside you. People who will love along with you. People who will love **you.**  

They're there.  


You *deserve* it.


Look inside yourself and find whatever broke you. Face it. Talk about it. Make it show it's ugly face and *defeat* it. It has ***no*** place in your loving heart.  

**None.**


Write it down. Burn it. Write an email. Forgive. Pray. Meditate. Destroy your addictions. Destroy your vices. Leave them behind. Starve them of your attention.  

Share your talents. Enjoy the world. Do something that scares you. Conquer those fears. Fill your heart with joy. Do those little things. Make your bed. Clean your room. Leave the world a lovelier place. Tip a little more. Smile bigger. Make your neighbor laugh. 

Don't look back until you know that you've won. Then see what you've become. You are empowered to make a difference.


There are so many things in this world that are worth fighting for. Worth living for. Worth hurting for. It doesn't always seem like it at the time, or in that particular moment. But I promise you it's worth it. I've been there, in that awful place.


Free yourself.  

Love yourself.  

Become yourself.


Be wholly ***you.***

&gt; ""so when you look at yourself, tell me who do you see? Is it the person you’ve been or the person that you're gonna be?""

&gt; ""Trust, is such a fragile thing. Takes some time to build. And can shatter in a blink. I promise not to blink! Cause if you ask me, how I see it, I can show you. Step into the light. Your glass heart's been in a sharp place, walking on tightropes, dancing on razor blades. I see through those dark days, let me hold your glass heart we'll never break. Let me hold your, glass heart.""


&gt; ""take me to a different place, where love is not illusion-based and fear is just a word they can't define.

The answer that we never seem to find. The hand we always take disintegrates without a trace, and we're the ones they've always left behind. Help me understand the best is yet to come. Take me by the hand before I come undone. ‘Cause all this emptiness has left me feeling numb. But it's darkest right before the sun.""",31Aug2017,1
32,"grammar is going out the window here, i'm probably a little drunk from last night.

they say if you cook a girl eggs in the morning she'll love you or something like that. but eggs are complicated. they've got a shell, and a white part, and a yellow part, and maybe some other part, and maybe some part on the shell... but it's not that complex. all it takes is heat control, and knowing your audience.

you don't need water. you don't need milk. you don't need cream. you don't need salt. pepper. whatever. fuck all that. you nee heat control, and to know what your audience wants.

the heat control is by far the easy part. get to know your stove a bit. mine runs hot, and the burners don't light. EZ PZ as we say in rainbow 6. turn it on low, put a good amount of butter in the pan. now a little more. that's all you need other than eggs. also other than heat control and knowing your audience.

so you've got a pan, i don't care what kind of pan, it can be a lobster pot. doesn't matter. you've got a pan, a good amount of butter (add more) and it's on low, so the butter is melting. crack 2 eggs in a bowl, and mix them up with a fork.

""oh do i wait to see little bubbles at the edge of the eggs?"" ""do i add a little milk?"" ""julia child uses chopsticks"" ""maybe i can drink off this hangover""

none of that shit matters. just mix up the eggs. mix them up, and put them in the hot pan. if they sizzle, you fucked up. you fucked up heat control. go join the marines.

you can always make the eggs hotter. you're never going to uncook them. and that's not a stupid fucking metaphor. put the eggs in the pan, if they sizzle you fucked up, if they just sit there and you're like ""uh these aren't cooking i'm gonna eat raw eggs because i'm not even actually cooking i'm just typing out a reddit post that is apparently my thesis paper"" you did it right.

now, we get to the hard part. and if you're still with me, i don't know why the fuck i didn't just make this a video, and i REALLY don't know why the fuck i'm not just eating my own fucking eggs right now. for your information a girl did *NOT* wake up here this morning, and she will *not* be falling in love with me because I make good eggs. which i do. which is why we're here.

ok so who is your audience? is it just you? why am i asking that, yes it's just you, you made it this far. ok so how do you like your eggs? COOK THEM THAT WAY

you want em runny? under do em. you want em hard? cook em up. (i've actually found that under stress eggs handle high temp very well, if you like your eggs hard, it's surprisingly hard to fuck this up, i've tried)

now we get to where heat control and your audience crosses over.

here's the fucking magic. we've all seen that gordon video where he talks about taking the eggs on and off the heat, but he makes a big show of it. it's *not that complex*. you just need to cook them until you think ""huh these are almost done."" and that's IT. put them on a piece of fucking toast right then.
 
the residual heat of the eggs themselves is going to cook them a little more, and they're going to be like that place in Maine that makes mean mac and cheese, and pretty good eggs.

now, i've rambled on a lot to get my word count up, but i'll go put a TLDR at the top. oh wait, there is one, it's the title.

it comes town to- take the eggs off when you think (you, being your audience) they're almost done. that's it. that's all your heat control, and entertainment. that's the fucking trick.

Hello I would like to know why i have been banned Sincerely
 
MODERATOR
What does the ban message say?

ME
Ok, to read the rules, what i've done, and understood that i should not post question. Mea culpa. Does that mistake imply a BAN ? Isn't that extreme ?
Sorry for my poor english, i'm a french novelist
 
MODERATOR
Are you saying we shouldn't ban people for breaking the rules?
 
ME
No, i try to say that there is a difference for breaking them consciously (trolling) and breaking them by mistake for being new (suscribed to reddit yesterday). Don't you think so ?
 
MODERATOR
Are you suggesting our rules are only enforceable if someone breaks them on purpose?
 
ME
No, i suggest that : - your rules may content softer measure for early birds, especially when kindness is the main trait - you could take in consideration a human factor in the way to moderate, instead of enforce rules because they are written - banishing may be an extreme measure for such a mistake, and may be compared to forbid someone to cross the road ever again lifetime for having crossed the road out the zebras...

 
MODERATOR
We aren't enforcing rules simply because they are written. We enforce the rules because we have standards. We aren't interested in holding new users' hands, and we certainly aren't going to accept responsibility for user that have not read the rules. That onus is on you.
We aren't worried about expanding, or growing our user count. We aren't worried about spreading the word about literature, or bringing it to the masses. If we only have three active participants here, we are fine with that, as long as those three people are able to discuss literature without us babysitting.
So far, you have asked the same question four times, and have never commented which means you probably aren't a good fit for this subreddit.
Our only concern here is quality discussion about literature, nothing else.

 ME
I understood that you consider (and you're right) that my post is irrelevant. Nevertheless it seems clearly you are trying to tell me that you consider that i will not be able to post ""quality"" content.
I consider that this sort of attitude has a regrettable smell of mankind's darkest times, and i therefore give you credit on your last binary assumption, i am not a good fit for this (such ""moderated"") subreddit.
 
MODERATOR
No, I am saying you have demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to do so thus far. You have given us no reason to believe you are anything, but a low-effort user because you have not put any effort into anything you have done on reddit.
Feel free to paint this however you like, but you broke the rules, not us. Your constant attempts to shirk responsibility, and shift it to us isn't helping you at all.

ME
You are talking about my efforts on reddit that i would have the time to demonstrate after a 1 day membership. Congratulations
I do not shirk responsability. I broke the rule for not having read them, i take of course full responsibility of this such unforgivable and awful and terrible mistake that worth at least a lifetime ban, and why not an official complaint.
But I raise the question of your responsibility for lack of common sense regarding your respectful experience on reddit, and for confusing moderating and something a lot of people would consider dictatorship and poor judgment.
That's why I won't answer you anymore regarding your inability to understand subtilities, shades, and overall to have discernment, which is an essential component of intelligence. But i would put that on my inability to write perfect english, which is not my mother language.

MODERATOR
What should we use? Our telepathic powers?
Again, you are trying the play the victim. You broke the rules.
If there are a lot of people who subscribe to an overly dramatic, and hyperbolic view of a website, sure, but we don't respond well to this sort of thing. You seem to forget the part where we aren't interested in holding your hand, or reading the rules to you.
Again, you are trying to play the victim, and shift the blame to us. You seem to have a decent enough grasp on English, so I am not sure why this is difficult for you to understand. All you had to do was take responsibility, and, instead you argued about the subtleties of a site you do not understand. Perhaps you should get to know something before you argue about it.

40,"To nobody in particular, I'd like to share something I learned about myself. I don't want to burden anybody in real life with something as boring as talking extensively about myself, so I talk to the Internet instead. Meat-space me is for mostly listening, so Internet me is for talking. And this'll be the first of probably many ramblings about me, so if you're bored enough, you can follow me around and read my *innermost, intimate thoughts!*

&amp;nbsp;

Superficially, I'm conventionally attractive. Well, not sexy, but cute. I have a baby face, a fit figure, nice hair, and decent fashion sense, and short, too, so if you're into the loli kind of thing, that's me. Well, not ""loli,"" but I mean small, cute, innocent-looking. And beneath that adorable exterior, I'm pretty interesting, too! I mean, it's evident, anyway. Weird sense of humor, lots of hobbies, friendly. I've done things from drawing to dancing to even stilt-walking, and I look at tiles and try to find patterns in them. Weird person. What's not to like? 

&amp;nbsp;

I can attract any guy *I want,* and I emphasize any guy *I* want because I have strange taste (I tend to like the engineering students, for some reason... Apparently, they're not popular from what I've heard). I've rejected lots of guys who've liked me before, yes, even those outside of the engineering department, too~ 

&amp;nbsp;

And yet, I can't seem to make them *stay.* As soon as I get what I want, I either get bored and leave or mess things up by being too forward and then too timid and driving the guy crazy with my mercurial personality, and messing things up tends to happen more than getting bored. I get all weird and fidgety and I get talkative or get too intimate, and then I realize my mistake, then act ice-cold and go silent. 

&amp;nbsp;

I keep messing up because I keep thinking that every guy whose attention I manage to catch is ""The One."" I do dumb things like imagine our future together, or declare my emotions too soon, and I don't mean anything as bold and ridiculous as saying ""I love you"" within a few dates, I mean even something as subtle as sending good morning and good night texts every single day while he doesn't do the same. I mean giving gifts way too soon, and then, I realize that I'm doing the clingy thing again! See, look, I'm doing it, so I better stop that and go radio silent for three or four days, because we're friends and that sure makes sense, right? And then when I'm silent, I start fretting that I'm being too distant, what if he's paying attention to someone else now because I turned him loose!? Gah, I better remind him that I exist! By doing... what? By barraging him with a bunch of texts, of course! And the cycle begins again. 

&amp;nbsp; 

And because I keep thinking that the guy I'm currently interested in is ""The One,"" I keep misinterpreting the smallest things to mean something more significant and intimate than it really is. No, /u/MyFavoriteFan, when he said ""I miss us,"" he doesn't mean that he missed some deep, non-existing emotional connection that you thought the two of you shared, he means no one's talked to him for a few hours and he wants your attention. When he calls you ""babe"" or ""bb,"" he does it to everyone, male or female, and he doesn't mean it flirtatiously; you're not special to him in that regard. And even though he named you his special maid and you named him Master and the two of you speak to each each other like that through text, you're still being too forward, /u/MyFavoriteFan. You really do have a lot to learn about ""boundaries."" 

&amp;nbsp;

And because I keep interpreting things people say to be more meaningful than they really are, I keep being manipulated. It just feels so damn good to feel like I'm wanted and useful to someone that it's okay if they keep demanding and extorting from me --
whether it's time, affection, emotional or physical intimacy -- until I can't meet their demands anymore. I do get tired at some point, though, but I keep giving anyway because I think people will get off my back if I give them things they want, but no, they keep coming back for more and I'm just left exhausted. Then I leave, because my most favorite person in the world, my sister, who I tell everything to will tell me, ""No, /u/MyFavoriteFan! You're worth more than that! You're not someone's punching bag, leave!"" And for those who don't leech off of me to exhaustion, I give and give time and material items and affection until whatever I give turns cheap and valueless and they get bored and don't want it anymore. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm pretty and I'm smart and have talent in a few things, and relatively interesting and quirky, sure, but I'm also so flawed and have a lot of growing up to do. I guess since I'm still pretty young, it's alright. Maybe the best thing to do right now is to just keep busy with life and not worry about something like romance. I'm becoming more sure that that's one of the smaller things in life.  ",31Aug2017,1
42,"The title is a bit missleading but since that's the account made for my sex sins and experiences, I want to confess. 

First year if college. New city new friends, new place to live. 

I was finally living on my own and I loved this idea. 

Descriptions:
My friend: Mary
The boy: Max

We were all classmates at our college. 
Mary became my new best friend(she still is after many years). 
Mary fell in love with Max during the first year. She didn't understand why exactly. She liked him. And I was so happy for her. 
They kissed at a college party and I was really happy. 

On the other hand, Max was a really good friend of mine long before Mary tell me he likes him. 
I was more like Max's confident, giving him advice for girls etc. I liked to do that and help him. 

After they kissed at the party, max desperately called me telling me he did a mistake because he was drunk as fuck. And he told me to gently tell Mary not to make hopes. I told him to tell her that too and he did but I was caught in the middle. 

I was honest with Mary. I told her what he said. She seemed disapointed but she refused to give up. 

One day I invited both at my place to work something for college as a team (we were assigned). 

She kept begging me to try to hook her up with him and I was really caught in the middle. 

I refused her. She insisted so We playef some games with challenged blabla so they got challenged to kiss each other. 

She kissed him they seemed to enjoy I almost let them the keys to my house to have sex. Lol i was so nice back then lol. 

Anyway it's weird to explain. He told me that he really kissed her just  because it was the game challenge etc. but that he really doesn't like her. 

I told him it's none of my business and to solve it with her. 

He then dropped the bomb on me while she was on toilet (because it all happened in that night). 

He told me he doesn't like her because he fucking likes me and he sees the ideal in me and other blablaaas. 

To be honest I refused him I told him I will never be with a guy Mary liked out of respect for her. 

Then Mary came and the talk ended. 

They remained both to sleep at my place (they lived far away). 
Since I only had one huge bed and one room, we all had to sleep in one bed. But it wasn't a problem because we did that before. They used to come often at my place. It was like their second home. 

Anyway we went to sleep. 

I won't try to detail too much. The thing is he kissed me in my sleep. I felt it. At first I thought it was a dream and once I opened my eyes and I felt it better. Just waking up, I didn't know what exactly was going on but I just continued to kiss him for a few seconds. 

Then i woke up to go to the bathroom and i told him to never do it again. 

Fast forward a few days after, he came a  to help me carry some furniture and we kissed badly badly. We didn't do anything else just kissing. I was single he was single do hell why not?!

Also, during that week Mary told me she didn't actually like Max and that maybe she was obsessed to have sex but she's ok now. 

After I heArd it, I felt reliefed. But I still didn't throw myself in a relationship ( I was coming from a very long relationship).


He was madly obsessed with me. He told me he try everything to be my boyfriend but until then he accepted the fwb status we both had. 

We accepted to have sex and not tell anyone for a while.  (because we were classmates and it was weird we didn't want it). 

He was still hoping one day we may be boyfriend-girlfriend. 

The thing is, we didn't see other partners during our 'relationship'. Mostly because we had sex so often we didn't feel the need of someone else. 

Mary still doesn't know about it. It's been around 5 years and maaany sexy hot spicy sex moments had happened between me and Max. I will write some of them here maybe.
