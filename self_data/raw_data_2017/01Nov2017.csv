0,"This doesn't sound like a big deal but I've never done that! Every romantic situation I've ever been in has evolved naturally from friendship, never from a state of acquaintance -&gt; casual dating. Yesterday I ran into a beautiful lady I've met once or twice through mutual friends. I was sitting under a tree and she was walking by on her way to a nearby library. She stopped and said hi and we got to talking. After a bit she came over and sat down beside me to keep talking, and before long she was laughing a lot and so was I. After about 45 idyllic minutes of sitting under this tree with this gorgeous girl having a fun and free-ranging conversation, I realized I had to go to class, so I abruptly had to cut it short before the conversation came to a natural end. Later that evening I added her on Facebook, and today I worked up the courage to ask her what she's doing Thursday. Still waiting for a response, but whatever happens I'm happy I at least gave it a try! Good luck to any others contemplating anything like this.

EDIT:  IT WORKED we're going to a museum on Thursday AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH",01Nov2017,47

4,"(serious) Not trying to be snarky, I am genuinely curious. All I have seen so far has been consistent bashing of conservative media (""news"") outlets on their coverage of the growing Russian election influence scandal, and Mueller's actions this week. And rightly so, I might add.

But, it can't be ALL bad, can it? Is there anyone out there on the redder end of the political spectrum that actually practiced good journalism this week? So far, I haven't seen any. But I'm stuck in my own personal media bubble - so I cast the question to all of reddit.

They paid for the ticket, hotel and everything. At first, I was ecstatic. Life in a new city sounded refreshing and exciting, and the pay was solid. I was in college for 7 years, getting my associates first and finally my Bachelors, so all the hard work paid off finally. I start in March, but the closer the date comes, the harder it hits me how much i'm going to miss my family and old life here. My parents mean the world to me, and have supported me every step of the way. The thought of having them so far away brings me to an emotional mess. I've lived away from home before for college, but only an hour or so away. Living in a completely different state by myself seems so overwhelming, that I don't know how i'm going to handle it; I'm very excited for the opportunity but unsteady.

16,"I had a best friend. We didn't part on bad terms or have a friend-breakup or anything. We both just drifted, and it pisses me off. She was my best friend for 5 years, she's the closest to a sister I've ever had. Then she got a boyfriend, moved in with that him, got a new and healthy family, got a job, got new real-life friends, and she doesn't have time for me anymore.


See, we had a long-distance friendship. We met in 2013 through a Facebook fanpage for a band and hit it off so famously that we, in our stupid early teenage youth, actually thought we were the platonic, female-female version of [twin flames](http://www.soulevolution.org/twinflames/twinflames.htm). 

Even though it was ""just"" through the internet, I've never had a better friend. Her family loved me and I was on a first name basis with all of them. Her mom offered to let me fucking move in with them. We Facetimed and talked on the phone. I met her boyfriend before her family even knew about him; she talked about me so much he wanted to meet me so she added us all to a group chat. We were good friends as well.


Then we didn't talk for two months straight. Neither of us made an effort. She messaged me a day after my birthday to with me a happy birthday and say she still loves me and considers me one of her best friends (one? I used to be THE best friend, god dammit.) but she's been so busy she never has time to talk. She's sent me something since then and I haven't even looked at it. I just have nothing to say anymore, and to be totally and completely honest, I don't miss her. I feel no urge to reach out and I haven't for months.


I'm a b**ch and I have no idea where it came from. We had an argument in 2015 where we didn't talk for three months but we made up and have been fine since then. I wasn't jealous of her boyfriend of her achievements; I'm truly happy for her. It was good to see her happy and thriving after years of her being mentally ill and her family taking advantage of her. I've been trying to pinpoint when I became done and why and I can't. I was glad to be the person she came to during her many mental collapses, I didn't mind talking her down from her constant paranoia that her boyfriend was cheating on her, I put my personal views aside when she tried drugs and had a one night stand, I listened and gave advice whenever she had a problem. She supported me equally. I just have no idea what happened.

I took a year off last year and joined the reserves and my time in basic training was without a doubt the most fulfilled I’ve ever felt. At home it feels like every day has no purpose that isn’t 2 or 3 or 4 years away.

21,"Right now I’m sitting at home alone, drunk, eating take out Chinese, watching re runs of Frasier.

Now don’t get me wrong, Frasier is a funny show. But it has a laugh track. And the vast consensus is that laugh tracks are the devil. But I think I now realise why they’re there.

Usually the people that resort to watching sit coms are people exactly in my position. Alone, drunk, eating take out Chinese.

The laugh track makes you feel part of a crowd, it makes you feel like you’re watching with someone.

And for someone alone, that’s a comforting thing. I could just as easily watch a show without a laugh track, like Community which a is fantastic show. But in my current state, the laugh track makes me feel like I’m part of a group, and less alone than I am.

Maybe I’m just drunk and don’t know what I’m talking about. But I feel like it’s true.

Anyway, a few nights ago, I went to sleep earlier than I usually do. After falling asleep I had an extremely vivid dream. I still remember some parts of the dream, but what happened in the dream wasn't important. What was important was that, in the dream, I was happy. I remember thinking to my self in the dream ""everything is alright."" And then I woke up. I stared up at my ceiling, trying to hold onto that feeling as long as I could. I tried to process it, but it was a feeling like I'd never felt before. I just felt at peace. I fell asleep after staring into the darkness for i dont know how long, and when i woke up, the feeling was gone. I tried thinking back to a time when I was that happy, but I couldn't remember one. Days later I still can't. It made me realize just how anxious and depressed and lonely I've felt my entire life, and how not-normal I am that I'm not even capable of producing a basic human emotion. It made me think that if that's how I'm supposed to live the rest of my life, then I'd rather just die young. Why can't I just be happy?",01Nov2017,5

28,"Last time I actually had friends that were girls was in middle school. I got badly bullied by them and soon started hanging out with the dorky boys because we had the same interests, we'd all walk around town, have daily middle schooler adventures, play video games.

In 10th grade I was transferred to a new school because they wanted me to be in a ""smaller"" setting. This is where it really started getting bad for me socially. There was a lot more boys than girls, and the other girls were either very violent/unstable or wanted nothing to do with me. I had a lot of issues with my mental health (which was why I was in that school) but I've always been the least harmful person, I have never hit anyone, got into a fight, or even had the desire to hurt anyone in the slightest. I was terrified of the girls just having constant cat fights and going back and forth with Facebook scandals. 

11th grade I was in a secluded class and I was the only girl in the class. I got along great with everyone, but I missed a lot of days due to hospitalizations and had to repeat the grade. So my second year I transferred to a new school with *even less* girls (only one of my classes had any girls in it). I became best friends with one of them but I rarely talk to them now. She's quite busy I guess. The school required me to take a career course. I wanted to take childhood development but they said that wasn't an option. I fought tooth and nail for my second option, which was auto body. I loved it, but yet again I was the only girl. 

Senior year. There was only 9 girls in the entire school. They all were hard headed feminazis and I couldn't go 20 minutes without having a heated argument with them. They didn't like my sarcastic remarks, they'd bitch about how *all* guys, *every single one* on the planet would treat them like a piece of meat, and I'd just say ""mystery meat or choice cut steak?"" 

So now, I'm in business school. I wanted to branch out and make some friends that are girls. There are two girls around my age I used to enjoy talking to but now they only like talking to eachother. I try talking to them but they just don't really pay attention, they just sit there applying makeup (they literally just reapply their lipstick every break we get), taking selfies, and saying ""uh huh"" to everything I say. They in a way, talk down to me. They just say ""uh huh"" without paying any mind to what I'm saying until I get the message to be quiet. When I try to add in on their discussions, I realize I'm being totally ignored and yet again get the message. Sometimes when I talk they even exchange glances in a weird way. I don't even say anything weird, I just try to start or join in a conversation. Although when I spoke to my grandma she said that I was weird and that's probably why they don't want to speak to me. 

It just makes me feel so useless and unlikable when the whole class all knows each other's phone numbers and are Snapchat friends with a Facebook group chat and I'm just the weird bitch in the corner sending GIFs of cats and spongebob memes to my friend. 

I've been talked down to by my family and I've even heard some remarks from other people about having no friends that are girls. I've tried, they just want nothing to do with me.

30,"Hey, everyone. As per the title, clubs fill me with an awful sense of stress and anxiety. However, my partner enjoys clubbing a lot, and I know it'd mean a lot to them if I could join in. As it stands, well... I feel a bit of a buzzkill if I'm with them and it is decided that clubbing is the way to go. I do not expect to learn to love or even enjoy the experience, I would settle for tolerating it. As it stands, I really can't handle more than a few seconds before every fiber of my being screams at me to leave as soon as possible.
Realistically, I do not like to drink, nor do I enjoy dense crowds or dancing with strangers. Loud music is not by itself a bad thing (I quite like concerts, but tend to be in the seated area) but does add to the sensory overload. Enjoying a club might be a big ask given the above, but I think intense anxiety is not a normal or healthy response. I expect it's some combination of sensory overstimulation in addition to your run-of the mill social anxiety.
So, I wanted to see if anyone's noticed a similar response in themselves and if they'd found a way to bring that extreme (and I suspect not completely healthy) response more into line. Again, I don't expect to enjoy something that far from my tastes, but I'd like to be more flexible in my potential experiences.",01Nov2017,1

33,"After leaving my previous friend group, I was taken in by a group of girls who I was working with on a project. They invited me to their Halloween party which I actually went to last night. I've had bad social anxiety all throughout highschool, so this is only the second party I've been to. I wasn't even sure if I would be able to keep my anxiety under control for last night. But when I actually got there, I had almost no anxiety whatsoever. The last party I went to I was throwing up beforehand from nerves, so this is a huge accomplishment for me. 

It started out pretty awkward. It was me (a socially inept straight dude) and six girls. Eventually though we played a cards against humanity type voting game where I began to loosen up. They pulled me up to dance with them and despite usually being a horribly self conscious wreck, it was actually fun. It ended with two episodes of the new stranger things which I thoroughly enjoyed despite not having seen season one.

Well, forget might be the wrong word. Instead, 'lose significance' might be the right phrase. One doesn't seem to forget their issues fully, only find them unimportant, or that you're ""Coming around to dealing with them.""

It's weird, because it's not as simple as ""I can't do that"", ""This is difficult"", ""I'm not interested"", or things in that line of thought. It's dishonest to say that I can't pick things up. They just don't stick. And it takes almost violent effort to make them stick. Eventually, I lose.

Things don't, interests don't, people don't, time flies away too quickly and throwing my head at anything that requires focus after the very first time becomed increasingly more difficult. 

On the upside, I'm sure I'll get a fancy new way to say the exact same thing, again.",01Nov2017,2
41,"Fuck. I’m gonna try keep it brief as possible because I feel like I could go on forever here. All you need to know is this girl has a boyfriend, I’ve had a crush on her for months, and the last couple of them we’ve basically become best friends, although I’ve known her and got along well with her for a year. Now We spend all day talking to each other and I thought I was just in over my head with a stupid crush. I’d eventually find something I don’t like about her that would put me off. And I do find things I don’t like about her. But it doesn’t put me off at all. I just kind of accept them. She’s not like my ideal version of a girl or anything, but it’s like that doesn’t matter. The last week or so, I dunno, something’s clicked in my brain. Like I’ve always been hesitant to say I love anyone, I don’t think it should be thrown around. But I just KNOW. This is it, the first time I’ve known. I’ve never felt this way about anyone. We talk all day everyday and I never once get bored. It’s usually messaging, but we hang out more and more. She’s even refused to meet up with some of her best friends to be with me instead. She makes me feel like a little kid again.

I feel like my whole life I’ve been hiding my real thoughts from people, holding parts of myself back. And around her I don’t have to. Sometimes she’ll just blurt out some of my very innermost thoughts that I didn’t know anyone else ever thought of. I’ve never related more to anyone. Like just every single day there’ll be some little moment where I fall for her more. Sometimes the stupidest little things she does hit me like a fucking tidal wave and I feel so into her. Like she goes into a laughing fit, or she gets excited or something, and all I can do is sit there and smile, thinking that I want to make her that happy  as much as possible. Just little moments like this have been building every day for months and I just fall for her more and more. Sometimes I have such a massive urge to just tell her then and there how I feel, because it honestly sometimes feels like I can’t just keep it to myself.

But the biggest thing is that I know she cares about me. Maybe not romantically or whatever, but she wants the best for me. She’s always encouraging me to do better, she’s just such a good influence on my life. She remembers the tiniest details about me. We have stupid inside jokes that we both sit laughing at hysterically just by walking by somewhere something funny happened or something stupid like that. She told me that nobody ever gets her sense of humour, but she’s happy I do. I felt the exact same way back, I’d just never said it. She checks up on me constantly. Like it’s getting to the stage where we know each other so fucking well. She’s told me before that sometimes she feels like she doesn’t feel like talking to anyone, and I get the same feeling. But the thing is, I never get that with her, and I don’t think she does with me. We talk literally every chance we get, she even told me she talks to me more than her best friends but that she is happy about it.

Anyway, I dunno. I’m only 19. But honestly I’m pretty sure I’m in love with this girl, or getting there. She’s in a relationship right now, and I respect that. I used to think the whole ‘if you love someone, you’ll let them do what makes them happy’ thing was bullshit. I’ve had crushes where they liked someone else, and all I ever felt was jealousy. But with her I genuinely just feel happy that she’s happy. Maybe a little jealous, but that’s fo be expected. As pathetic and ‘Nice Guy’ as it sounds I honestly wouldn’t mind waiting for as long as it takes for me to have a chance. I’d never try to steal another guy’s girlfriend, but I feel like if I never do anything I’ll regret it for the rest of my life. It’s not the right time now, but I’m completely willing to wait until it is. That sounds so stupid, I know, but it’s the complete truth. I honestly feel like I could spend the rest of my life with her and be happy. I’ve never felt that about anyone. It’s fucking insane, and scary because in all likelihood I’m gonna get my heart broke here. 

**TL;DR:** Girl has a boyfriend. We always got along well, now we’re best friends. I’m pretty sure I’ve fallen in love with her, and that’s it’s went beyond a usual crush for a variety of reasons. It sounds stupid as fuck, but I could never get bored of her. Just had to get it off my chest.",01Nov2017,1

Literally any progress on life comes with uncomfortable situations. I have zero reason to be weirded out. I might be available to talk tomorrow, I don't want to think this evening. 

Having thoughts and feelings doesn't mean you've fucked up, regardless of whether they were in your control or not. I don't feel like it's reasonable to be ashamed of that in the slightest. 

Any boundary you've implied was my fault, I didn't want to come off as really weird, which would've been really easy. It still might be there. I don't know. But you're right about straightforward communication, over vague reddit communication.

And then about 30 min ago a guy drove by me while I was walking my dog and said FUCK YOU, YOU NIGGER! I'm 18 now. It doesn't bother me anymore because I'm use to this and other similar things. I remember one time a lady  assumed I was trying to rob a house that I lived in, but was locked out and wouldn't leave me alone until my parents came. I was checked in a store to see if I was stealing anything (In a wealthy area.

 I got other little things I remember, but this tends to be normal for my family, and other people I know, and me. I don't believe in systematic racism, but I can see why some would believe that. Just imagining what it was like during civil rights and before makes me more thankful for their efforts.

It used to hurt, but you get used to it.

Edit: Words

Edit 2: Well I'll be damned! I was gone for a few hours and this blew up in my face! (In a nice way) I appreciate whoever gave me gold! I never thought that would happen!

To answer a few questions. I'm 1/2 African American and 1/2 Jamaican so I am and look full fledge black.

I live in Charlotte, NC. That 1st incident happened in my home town of Greensboro, NC and the second was when I lived in Jamestown, NC. (We moved A LOT)

The reason I don't ""believe"" in systematic racism is honestly because I don't know a lot about it. Some people say this or that, but I never really looked to deep into it being busy and all that. Usually it's if you're being racist to me or around me you're a racist sack of shit.

I'm used to it, but if someone did that to me face to face they would probably be in the hospital or at least not feel very well. I'm just able to laugh off situations like these now, but stuff like searches and house thing aren't funny in the slightest. I told my family about it and they had the same reaction to when it happened which was ""hmph""

The first situation happened before I knew what Nigger meant so when I went home and asked about it my mom went ballistic on the teacher. The last two times happened in a drive by fashion so I couldn't respond and honestly it wouldn't have been worth the breath.

Again thanks for the gold!

54,"Hello! My name is Flynn Logsdon, I am a genetically augmented human from the year 2147, where I both witnessed an interplanetary civilization of humankind, as well as the ultimate destruction of this society. I was created in the year 2103, and I was designed with a lifespan of 200 years. Please refer to my proof as I utilized a zero-point nuclear displacement to be returned to the year 1979 when destruction of the space station I was residing on at the time was imminent, I spoke with many of my oldest friends and made the decision collectively. In the year 1987 I recorded and copyrighted some compositions of music, obviously it would be impossible for me to still look 19 years old and had been present in '87 without some truth to my claims.

I have honestly not harbored much paranoia or concern through the last several decades of my 82-year life, however in the fall of '93 my eyes got to a point where I needed a prescription, which did shake me up quite a bit with no advisors to refer to. I have remained silent to protect myself from this utterly unbelievable fact. However I can no longer stand idle, as I have seen the results of humans taking the course they are now, and it ends in peril. I've seen wonders of technology; augmented realities, androids on the moon, and superstructures on Mars, these are all marvelous achievements that I reveled in through my childhood, as well it has been an utterly mind shattering experience seeing some of the origins of technologies that my generation found commonplace...

Ask me anything! you honestly really could

P.S. I am not claiming to be a scientist or have deep technological understandings of every product I've interacted with in my lifetime, I was ultimately a consumer like any other outside of a few political positions I served, and some years on earth disassembling police analogues for profit, before the earth was uninhabitable (pre-2143). So unfortunately, no I can't give you a blueprint to beat Amazon to 360 projection UIs in the home, hahaaha, sorry",01Nov2017,3
56,"I’d write you a whole album if you wanted. 
A single bit coin at today’s price would get me out of all my pre-student loan debt and relieve so much stress on my life. My health would return, my fridge would be stocked, my socks won’t have holes and I would be able to sleep at night on the regular for class. I’d be able to see my family more too. 

It truly would be such a blessing that I’d be so grateful for and hopefully the charitable individual would like what I produce for them. 

Shot in the dark.

The podcast is called ""50/50: Bias Both Ways"" and the premise is a series of half hour interviews with controversial subjects. The first 15 minutes is really softball and the second 15 really contentious. The contentious segment was extended this week because Kelsey wanted to talk about a debate making the rounds on twitter about the “burning fertility clinic” thought experiment.

I think it's a really interesting one this week because so many pro-life advocates are coming from a religious background so having a debate on the topic with zero appeals to a higher power is really valuable in my opinion. 

I’d really appreciate any and all feedback and if you do like the idea of my podcast I wouldn’t discourage you from subscribing on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/50-50-bias-both-ways/id1291782168?mt=2), [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/5050podcast), or another [RSS](http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:335445242/sounds.rss) client obviously.
