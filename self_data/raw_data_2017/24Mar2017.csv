2,"Having dismissed them, meeting both with wind and tide favorable at the same time, the signal being given and the anchor weighed, he advanced about seven miles from that place, and stationed his fleet over against an open and level shore.

But the barbarians, upon perceiving the design of the Romans, sent forward their cavalry and charioteers, a class of warriors of whom it is their practice to make great use in their battles, and following with the rest of their forces, endeavored to prevent our men landing. In this was the greatest difficulty, for the following reasons, namely, because our ships, on account of their great size, could be stationed only in deep water; and our soldiers, in places unknown to them, with their hands embarrassed, oppressed with a large and heavy weight of armor, had at the same time to leap from the ships, stand amid the waves, and encounter the enemy; whereas they, either on dry ground, or advancing a little way into the water, free in all their limbs in places thoroughly known to them, could confidently throw their weapons and spur on their horses, which were accustomed to this kind of service. Dismayed by these circumstances and altogether untrained in this mode of battle, our men did not all exert the same vigor and eagerness which they had been wont to exert in engagements on dry ground.

When Caesar observed this, he ordered the ships of war, the appearance of which was somewhat strange to the barbarians and the motion more ready for service, to be withdrawn a little from the transport vessels, and to be propelled by their oars, and be stationed toward the open flank of the enemy, and the enemy to be beaten off and driven away, with slings, arrows, and engines: which plan was of great service to our men; for the barbarians being startled by the form of our ships and the motions of our oars and the nature of our engines, which was strange to them, stopped, and shortly after retreated a little. And while our men were hesitating [whether they should advance to the shore], chiefly on account of the depth of the sea, he who carried the eagle of the tenth legion, after supplicating the gods that the matter might turn out favorably to the legion, exclaimed, ""Leap, fellow soldiers, unless you wish to betray your eagle to the enemy. I, for my part, will perform my duty to the commonwealth and my general."" When he had said this with a loud voice, he leaped from the ship and proceeded to bear the eagle toward the enemy. Then our men, exhorting one another that so great a disgrace should not be incurred, all leaped from the ship. When those in the nearest vessels saw them, they speedily followed and approached the enemy.

The battle was maintained vigorously on both sides. Our men, however, as they could neither keep their ranks, nor get firm footing, nor follow their standards, and as one from one ship and another from another assembled around whatever standards they met, were thrown into great confusion. But the enemy, who were acquainted with all the shallows, when from the shore they saw any coming from a ship one by one, spurred on their horses, and attacked them while embarrassed; many surrounded a few, others threw their weapons upon our collected forces on their exposed flank. When Caesar observed this, he ordered the boats of the ships of war and the spy sloops to be filled with soldiers, and sent them up to the succor of those whom he had observed in distress. Our men, as soon as they made good their footing on dry ground, and all their comrades had joined them, made an attack upon the enemy, and put them to flight, but could not pursue them very far, because the horse had not been able to maintain their course at sea and reach the island. This alone was wanting to Caesar's accustomed success.

The enemy being thus vanquished in battle, as soon as they recovered after their flight, instantly sent embassadors to Caesar to negotiate about peace. They promised to give hostages and perform what he should command. Together with these embassadors came Commius the Altrebatian, who, as I have above said, had been sent by Caesar into Britain. Him they had seized upon when leaving his ship, although in the character of embassador he bore the general's commission to them, and thrown into chains: then after the battle was fought, they sent him back, and in suing for peace cast the blame of that act upon the common people, and entreated that it might be pardoned on account of their indiscretion. Caesar, complaining, that after they had sued for peace, and had voluntarily sent embassadors into the continent for that purpose, they had made war without a reason, said that he would pardon their indiscretion, and imposed hostages, a part of whom they gave immediately; the rest they said they would give in a few days, since they were sent for from remote places. In the mean time they ordered their people to return to the country parts, and the chiefs assembled from all quarter, and proceeded to surrender themselves and their states to Caesar. ",24Mar2017,2

5,"So I want to go to Lollapalooza. My friends have convinced me that it'll be good for me. 

I'm antisocial (I haven't had anybody visit me and I haven't visited anybody else for *months*) and I'm a very lackadaisical person so maybe the experience will be good for me. I think it will because it'll force me to get a job to pay for it and it'll force me to get a license so that alone will get me out of the house. 

Also, they told me in that environment you're expected to let loose and go crazy. I'm a very quiet person, so being loud would feel great. 

I'm thinking about going Thursday and Saturday. Thursday I want to go because there's a lot of people I like(Muse, Lorde(kind of), Cage the Elephant, Porter Robinson, Jon Bellion, George Erza, Cheat Codes) but Saturday has some of the more chill artists I like(Glass Animals, Vance Joy, Sylvan Esso). If I have the extra money I'll go all four days but idk if I can do that. 

Thoughts? Should I go? I hear drugs are pretty rampant out there but to be perfectly honest I wouldn't mind having a good time given the opportunity. I'd be responsible about it though.

7,Fuck these flesh suits. I'm tired of sustaining myself. I'm tired of the drive to sustain myself. I'm sick of eating and loving to eat; sick of sleeping and feeling sleepy; sick of the idea of sex.

8,"I'm 21, and I feel so old, both mentally and physically. I have no friends or social life since I started high school. I was the loner in my class, daydreaming about this boy that I had a crush on, which I consider my first love. I miss being that young, more naive and hopeful for the future. Little changed throughout college.

I feel like I wasted my teen years. I'm trans, still in the closet, and never really got the chance to be myself. After my only friend ditched me I closed myself into my own little world. Instead of going out, going to parties and just doing anything fun I would just be at home sulking, daydreaming about life as a cis girl.

It's funny (not) looking back through my posting history here. I felt this way, envious of people younger than me, since I was 18. I always felt younger/less mature than my current age, and the responsibilities that came with it. Maybe it's because I was born premature? I doubt it. 

I always always holding onto the past. I had a phase when I was 10 I think, that I really wanted to be a little kid again. I loved stuffed toys until I was way too old for them, and when I finally got into action figures I was told I was too old for it. I didn't felt ready to go to college at 17, but that's what my parents wanted. Having such a socially reclusive life makes me not feel ready at all to be an adult, and I'm not.

I can't do anything on my own. I don't know how to pay bills, I never go anywhere on my own. I just wish I could be independent, but that's easier said than done.

I got hooked on this family vloggers, something I've always hated. It's like I'm living vicariously through them somehow. I haven't felt this obsessed with something since high school, and watching these young kids and teens have fun make me wish I could be a teen again. One of the kids from the family died before I started to watch them, and I became so invested in it, it scares me. I've been thinking about this all the time, indulging in my sadness by watching their old videos. This level of obsessions is such a throw back to my teens, I remember having a crush on an actor, to the point I could hardly think about him without sighing out loud.

I would like to have a second chance at it and actually live it, not just stand by like I did. But I'd want to get a fair chance this time, as a cisgender girl. 

I can hardly remember what it was like to be a teen, it feels like that was a lifetime ago, even though it passed so fast at the same time. I was never photogenic, I'm still not, but I remember looking at myself in the mirror back then and thinking I was cute. I was sooo thin, I can't believe I honestly felt like this huge whale. I remember I hated this over sized jacket from the school uniform in high school, I thought it made me look enormous. It was shocking when I saw pictures of me in it about two years ago, the jacket would hang from my shoulders because I was so thin. 

But now I really am overweight. I lost so much hair, my once small and round forehead is now huge and rectangular. My body is much more masculine now, I don't think I'll ever get to be the pretty girl I've always wanted to be.",24Mar2017,3

14,"So me and my friends were out skating around campus(I'm a college student). When we go to sit down, we start acting goofy and talking to people going buy and such. This one girl goes by and and we just act goofy, not insulting, just goofy. She told me here name and a few details about her job and such. And she seems to show some interest in my friend. 

So I go later(now) to look her up on Facebook, and there are two people with her exact name. One far away, who is not her, and one in my city. I look at both, find out that the one far away is just a coincidence. I look at the other one, and it's her. All of her details are the same, except where she said she's from. Like her details were too exact to be a coincidence. Same job location, same jobs, same high school, etc. But the pictures aren't her. Its a completely different person.

17,"Whats up reddit. I just came to share where Im at with life and if anyone else has felt like this. 
Years ago, I made myself into the person I wanted to become. I had 100% integrity. I was empowered in myself, confident and no hang ups with anything. 
But this was at age 13-14 and I felt so ahead of all my peers, my friends and even my parents I felt kind of lost, - I had no one to relate to. 
I then had a relationship that was wrong for me - it took me away from who I am slowly and ended with me being kind of depressed - she ended it with me and as much as I tried to figure out where it went wrong it was all my fault from the get go - I didn't see her for who she really was and going out with her was a complete betrayal of myself. I just didn't realise until it was too late. Which is fine Ive learnt from that. 
But years have passed, I'm 25 now and its like Im so fucking out of touch with myself, through shit jobs, college and life in general. Honestly its killing me. 
I used to be so open so alive. Now I'm closed up, un trusting, etc and its killing me. 
I want to get myself back to who I am meant to be, Ive cut myself off from a lot of people - for better or worse - and I want to reclaim who I am. 
But I can't seem to figure out who that is anymore.
On top of this I didn't make it out of my parents house. I feel like instead of growing into who I could of been I went backwards with everything. What makes things harder is they are old - my dads 85 and where before I wouldn't of thought much about him, I feel like I have appreciated him more this last few years and instead of fully going at it in life I have held myself back a bit to appreciate the time I have left with him, but in doing so my life has suffered.

19,"Quite a while ago on reddit /r/adviceanimals was a default sub and it annoyed many people. Luckily people could unsubscribe by making an account.

Recently /r/popular has been made and /r/adviceanimals is barred from /r/popular, but memes have evolved since the innocent days of 2014 so now we have hundreds of meme subreddits and they are all growing really fast. 

This can be seen as a good thing as I enjoy them,  but the one of the benefits of /r/popular is that all subreddits have an equal chance of appearing. I figure the same forces which made /r/adviceanimals popular enough to be a default, the fact that the submissions are quick to consume and relatable has made it so all these meme subreddits grow really fast.

The problem is that some people don't want to see memes so while before they could just unsubscribe from /r/adviceanimals now every single meme subreddit must be filtered out and more can just keep poping up.

20,"Alright, so I was in a relationship with this girl. We were together for 3 1/2 years and kept talking even after I left. She has borderline personality disorder. Selfharmed a lot, and took medicine and was in general pretty horrible towards me sometimes. I eventually broke it off because I got tired of it. I have had my own issues with depression and suicide, I just got to a breaking point of not being able to deal with it anymore. It was a long distance relationship at first. But we skyped everyday. Eventually we both stopped going to Highschool. I dropped out (for numerous reasons). 

But eventually she moved in with me for about the last year and a half of our relationships. She was my first kiss, my first time having sex, basically my first time for everything really. 

I even owe my life to her as she called the cops on me when I went to try and kill myself. But I still left her, because the mental abuse was a lot, and sometimes physical. 

I know it was a toxic relationship and once I convinced her to move back home and to start going back through school and to try to get help is when it got pretty bad. 

Cut through a year of manipulation and other shitty exchanges over skype. I started my first year of University. I was a few weeks into the first semester. One morning I get a call from her grandma. We had gotten to know eachother well as my gf have no mother or father, just lived with her grandma. But I get a call telling me she had killed herself. 

I was devastated. I didn't go to school for about 2 weeks. Fast forward 4 months and I get a phone call from a number from her general area. It's her. I didn't know what to do besides cry. I was hurt. I was sad. For about 4 days she tried to play it off like nothing happened until telling me it was all a ruse to hurt me. 

We talked for about 3 more weeks until I told her I was done. I was tired of her hurting to me, lying to me, doing fucked up shit to herself physically and to me mentally. She agreed she wouldn't contact me anymore. I deleted her new number and eventually she stopped calling. 

I met her when I was 14. We stopped talking when I was 19 and I'm 22 now. She is still on my mind all the time. And I miss her. I know she is unstable and toxic, but I feel empty with out her, I feel like half of me is missing and I don't know what to do about it. I just want her back in my life, I have dreams of her all the time, but I cannot find her old number, her friends have said they haven't talked to her in over a year. It just feels like a mistake to have wanted to never talk to her again. 

When we first broke up I dated 2 other people, but neither of them lasted for more than like a month. So from 17 until now I haven't dated anyone, and there have been women who I have been interested in, but I don't even bother trying. I just don't know what to do anymore.

* The risk of getting a sexually-transmitted disease is zero.
* I'll never be cheated on
* No risk of having kids, paying potential child support
* if I want a big change in my life, all my concern is how I handle it, not if my SO likes it.

Never having a girlfriend sure leaves me longing for intimacy. I struggle to choose whether that or the things above are more important. I thing love is beautiful. It's nice. 

Then however, I think about my chances. I never had a girlfriend. I never kissed, dated. 

I never cared for sex, so my lack of sexual life doesn't bother me.

I think about those chances. I'm shy, clueless, average-looking, though people of both sexes think I'm sweet. I'm still troubled by bullying and abuse I've experienced in last few years; I'm usually doing my best to be kind, but sometimes I feel just fucking pissed that I had to endure so much pain. Pissed on the people that bullied me, and the world in general. I then feel like being passive-aggressive to punish the world for it all. For it to feel the pain I felt. I do realize it is totally pointless and a dick move to be like that, so I never acted on it, it's more like that fantasy you have about torturing your bully. Maybe not literally, but similar in the sense of it. 

Those chances don't exist. I'm not asking girls out, because I'm tired of the pain - any time I asked someone out I got rejected. All my crushes rejected me, too. Some became straight out aggressive - one girl spread rumors that I harassed her, though she was always the one coming up to me (and was always very nice).

24,"Just to preface, this may be long winded, hold no real purpose, and is me blowing off some steam in a social medium. So, where to begin? At this current moment in life there is a double edged sword stuck through me. What this sword consists of is my schooling, work, aspirations, and the person I am seeing. These all bring a great amount of happiness into my life but there is a dualism to them.

I'm in college at the moment and I'm not feeling so sure about it. On one hand sticking it out seems like the right decision. On the other, I'm just meandering throughout my classes. Nothing has really caught my interest. I can get good grades when I decide to try but as of late it all feels rather pointless.

My work is interesting yet soul sucking. I deal with customers most of my day but it is at a unique attraction. The customers are both my favorite and most hated aspect of the work. Getting to meet tourists from all over the country/globe is delightfully draining. I've learned that I have a knack for customer service; I've been contemplating putting the skill to use somewhere more worthwhile.

What I aspire towards is aviation. Flying an aircraft is always something that has fascinated me since a young age. I was going to join the military for this but my health is an issue sadly. I've been on the brink of taking a loan to get the qualifications to fly but debt scares me. One concern of a pilots career is being away from home all the time; I'm not sure if I'm suited to spend that amount of time away from loved ones.

Lastly the person I'm seeing. They are a bundle of wonderful things. They understand me and remember the smallest details, it is touching really. Every text I receive from them brightens my day to an amazing degree. Currently I just want to spend time with them but haven't been able to lately. It is painful to write this as I'm not entirely sure if our feelings are completely mutual. It just makes me feel pretty forlorn.

Everything ties together to give me hope while tearing it to pieces at the same time. My life feels as if it's in some stagnant purgatory where everything is in a haze and no direction is clear. Nonetheless, what will come will come. I try to refuse to let the amassing worries burden me but it is difficult. Anyways I don't know where I was going with this, if it is slightly incoherent it's because I'm sleepy. Thanks for reading!

So I am looking to move in with my girlfriend to an apartment that was built in 2014.  The place in general looks nice, and it has plenty of room for the two of us.  It is a townhouse in between 2 other like townhouses (not that this probably matters), but the issue is that this place, upon inspection of the house by us before we sign the lease, seems to have had water damage.  The doors, as shown in the images, to the indoor air unit have bubbled up at the bottom; the floors used to be carpet, but they replaced it with laminate hard wood; the the indoor air unit appears to have mold around it, along with the water heater having some mold behind it.

I have not yet signed the lease, and realistically I do not have to, I know that, but I am wondering more so the answer to this question: first - this does look like mold correct? Second - when they start to remove the mold (I asked them to do so), how long will it take typically if they have to eradicate it and remove all the dry wall areas affected, and replace it all.  Lastly - if I sign the lease with their signatures, our signatures, and dates on the images as well, will I be protected legally with them removing the mold?

Hey assholes, why are you switching lanes so goddamn much? We're all not fucking going anywhere. 

If you know, because of your commute, that the carpool lane ends where the highway splits, and you need to get across three lanes of traffic in an eighth of a mile to get where you're going, don't take the fucking carpool lane.

Why do open highways have to slow down 20mph near exits? You don't have to slow down before moving into the right lane, there's still a mile or so. You can tell there's not many people getting on at the exit too.
