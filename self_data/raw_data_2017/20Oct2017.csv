2,"Idk where to post this. I don’t use Reddit much. This sub seemed like a good place to.

I have medical issues that make it hard to get into the physical school building. I was looking at online school to solve this. I was just wondering if it would look bad.",20Oct2017,1
3,"I feel fine! This is a huge step forward for me. We had been talking a bit at a shared social club thing and she seemed nice, so I asked her to coffee and she said no.

This marks the first time I asked someone else out in real life since junior high, and I'm in my second year of university. I went through a really rough time in high school in regard to my physical appearance, peaking at probably 310 pounds.

Since then, I've lost 100 pounds (bit more to go :)), taken up some sports (especially cycling) and have a quality of life I would never have dreamed of just two short years ago. I moved out of my parent's house, took control over my finances, got involved (or at least informed) politically, took up interesting hobbies. No longer are video games the only thing I can talk about!

But the one sticking point, the one place I still felt unfulfilled was romantically. I knew that I wasn't ready for any type of relationship, be it casual or otherwise, until recently. But I felt like maybe it was time to give it a shot about a month ago.

I registered for tinder and went on a few dates there, then decided to up the ante by asking someone out in real life. i was worried that even the slightest rejection would completely destroy any progress I had made, and that I had merely fooled myself into thinking I had changed.

But that didn't happen! I held my head high, brushed it off, confident that this wasn't a big deal.

This really was the confirmation I needed that I have put the dark days behind me, and I can step out into the world as a confident, proud person, who isn't going to drag down the people around me, and really has positive things to contribute to the world.

I don't think I have ever felt happier in my entire life.",20Oct2017,86
5,"You held me.captive with tales of love, family, trust, support, friends, a future...it was all a lie. Your words ""I don't love you, I never loved you, I'm not in love with you, I was never in love with you, I don't want to marry you, and I never wanted to marry you. I just didn't want to be alone."" You told me I saved your life. You were in despair and wanted to die and I righted your world and gave you hope. You used me to fix you while destroying me. You didn't care. You fucked my friends and lies to me. You convinced all my friends I was crazy, an alcoholic, and addict when really I was hiding all that in you from them. You had no friends and took all of mine. You had no interests and assimilated mine and my life as yours. You took everything from me.and then tossed me aside. When I tried to leave you telle.mo please don't go. I love you, I need you. You're my best friend. All the while you destroyed me more and more. You trash talked me behind my back. I guess you thought I wouldn't know. I've known everything the entire time and stayed trying to help you because I loved you more than myself. I still do. Goddamit why can't I hate you. No I hate me instead. I have no one and nothing. I live in a house filled with boxes. To broken to cafe to unpack anything. I don't eat, sleep, hear people speak to me, feel the living touch of a single soul. I go days and sometimes weeks and not hear anyone speak. I've had 5 deaths in 8 weeks and not one person asks if I'm ok. If I need a hug. If I just need a shoulder so I can fucking cry not alone for once. You have been there for each one, you have been cold or yelled at me after I came home from watching Toni die right in front of me. Fuuuuckkkmkm! Why am I not enough for anyone? Why do I have to be strong for everyone and help tnem.theougb when no one gives a damn. You told me you gave a damn enough for the world and then crushed me under your shoe when it was not easy. I gave you heroin addicted son back. I got him clean twice, brought him here, helped you two for what...so he could be your (you the alcoholic) bartender, drinking pal, drug buddy, and dealer. How in the fuck can people think I'm the bad one. How can I still love you and just want you to hold me and tell me everything will be ok? I wish I could kill the part of you In me off but that would mean killing myself. The mental pain is so great I cannot take it. I've lost 20 pounds this past 2 months. I don't sleep and all I do is cry and hate myself. I wish I had never met you. That I had stuck with I'm never dating again. I wish I could fall asleep and not wake u.t this anguish was gone!

10,"I experienced a scary moment at work today, and I don't know how to feel about it.  I'm hoping some of you could help me clear my mind.

I work for a family owned business in a somewhat shady area with a mom, a dad, and their adult son.  I work with the son on a regular basis as the parents are close to retirement, and they are always busy running errands.  The family owns two buildings: a front building for the business, and a back building for personal storage.

Today, while the son was out on his lunch break, I answered an inbound call from a toll free number.  It was ADT security.  They stated an alarm went off, and then promptly asked if I was alright.  I had no idea what was going on as I heard nothing at all.  They noted the call as a wrong number at the end.  A few minutes later, the dad called.  He informed me he received a call that the back building alarm was triggered.  ...I was completely by myself.  The dad then calmly asked for me to check around the building for any signs of a break in.  I did not feel comfortable at all with this, but he is my boss, and they have told me this happens somewhat often.  So, after grabbing my knife from my purse, and keeping the dad on the phone, I walked to the back building, and checked around to look for any signs of a break in.  Turns out, after the call drops,  there's a broken window.  I quickly walk back to the front building, shaking, and the dad calls back.  I informed him of my findings, and he tells me to let his son know to reset the alarm and call the window replacement business.

I'm not going to lie, I was scared.  I'm slightly upset that both the son and the dad were acting casual about it, but at the same time I'm not sure if I am overreacting about it.  I am known to be sensitive.  What do you think?  Am I overreacting, or did I actually put myself in danger?",20Oct2017,2
11,"I don't want to be whiny but I'm seriously starting to think I'm abnormal. Most of my friends have had boyfriends or girlfriends, or at least a guy in their lives. I'm 18 and it shouldn't bother me, but the average age people have sex is 17 and I feel like I'm not normal. I think a lot of this anxiety stems from being an awkward loner growing up, and the guy I'm interested in is older and more experienced. 

I found him really attractive and pursued his friendship, but I think I've cemented our relationship as purely platonic because I'm too scared to initiate intimacy wih anyone. Every chance I've had in the past to start a relationship I've chickened out and I'm worried this fear of intimacy will keep me from any chance of a relationship or achieving any romantic milestones. 

I know it's really silly to think the worst at such a young age, but I can't help but compare myself to my peers and wish I could have the same level of confidence. 
I have a massive crush on this guy and fantasize about being with him but our age gap is too wide and a relationship could never work out in the immediate future. This is only assuming that he's also interested in me as well. I don't really want a serious relationship currently, just someone to do couple shit with and get my firsts out of the way. I haven't even held hands with a guy in a romantic context for fucks sake and I'm not even ugly! My fear of intimacy yet still craving it is really fucking with me and I'm so lonely but scared. I wish I could just stop worrying and just let it happen. 

I'm just so afraid to lose my inhibitions. Falling in love is easy, being in love is hard, and falling out of love is even harder. I hate the idea of being so vulnerable but I would also love to share that side of me with someone, I just don't understand. I wish I could let go and seize the day.",20Oct2017,3

17,"Drunk enough to go through with classes.
The new semester has begun and my number one fear in this life is reading texts out loud. Presentations aren’t a problem anymore, but this class is in French, and in some classes we have nothing to do in the first week but to read a text out loud, together. What is this, fucking primary school?

French is a problem. I study languages and had native speaker level in French- once. I love the way it sounds when other people speak French, but my voice tends to bastardize languages. I want to be an interpreter, but my voice is ugly. 

I’ve been telling myself that I’ve come so far, I’ve overcome my fear of presentations and this is just the next step and that I can do it, that other people don’t give a fuck and just go to class because they need the credits and they don’t care about others (which is true for me), but my brain makes me hyperventilate. 

I don’t know, I hope this is the right subreddit. In the past, I’ve had a shot of rum with my coffee for presentations, but this is the first time I’m really trying to get myself drunk. 

I hope it works. If I’ll have to read something out loud and it doesn’t, I think I’ll die. ",20Oct2017,16
19,"I’m asking for your help reddit... FYI my grammar sucks, plz don’t judge me... lol let the story begin 
Back in April I purchased a 2017 Ford Fusion. I went slightly over my budget, cuz I am a 22 year old single man... who just wanted to drive a bad ass car. Welll here we are in October. My parents are gonna be moving out of state, and they gave me the choice to move with them. Or stay behind all by my myself, to live on my own. I can’t afford to live on my own, with this brand new car. Because insurance on the thing is thru the roof. Plus the payments being at the tail end of my budget. PLZZZZ HELP ME.. I am trying to get rid of the car, that I still owe a pretty big chunk on. But I know that the dealership isn’t gonna give me, nearly what it’s worth. I still owe $26k on it, so if I was to sell it on Craigslist or something. I would have to get at least that... how am I gonna find someone to buy my 5 month old car with only 4K miles on it :( I’m asking for your help Reddit. What do I do... to get rid of my car, that I still owe a huge amount on... ",20Oct2017,0
20,"I recently found out my girlfriend was pregnant.
Yes, we should've been more careful and used more protection; that does us no good now.

We are 21 and 20 years old - She makes a bit above minimum wage, I make $13 an hour. From the moment we found out she has been incredibly calm albeit it very understandably upset at first. I am continuing to panic and can't stop reading about peoples horrible experiences being raised by poor young parents, and fathers who regret having children...

When we found out my first instinct was to pressure her into an abortion, which I am not proud of.

Part of me wants to take care of her so badly right now and make sure we get signed up for all the goverment assistance, and make sure she eats and sleeps right etc. But my initial panic is still there; I'm not ready to be a father. I want to continue to pressure her but am trying to keep it shut mostly, because she has religious convictions to not abort, and her parents have money so she isnt terribly worried.
I can afford to rent a 2bedroom apt 
for around 1k a month and have 600 left over for various expenses. WIC and food bank and food stamps can mostly sustain her and the baby, and I have been practicing feeding myself for 10 bucks a week, and its not too bad. Grandparents would help a lot with intial supplies and cost.

Is this me convincing myself that things will be okay when they won't? Im barely a year into my degree and dont want to lose my 20s. She said if I left she wouldnt even pursue me for child care and would move in with her well off parents, but she is sure she is doing this with or without me.

I love her to death, and the thought of her being a single parent makes me want to off myself. I want to take my share of the responsibility and I want to continue doing school and working and support her. 

But no part of me wants this child right now. I feel my ideal outcome would be a medical abortion now and then trying again when we're stable. Will marrying her and supporting this baby out of feeling I need to be the worst choice I could make? Fathers that regret it seem to think so... I love her so much and planned on starting a family with her once I got on my feet, but not yet.. I also love her parents and ultimately wanted to spend my life with her, but after finding out i feel less in love and so afraid and am almost ready to take off. Please share any advice and experiences you have.",20Oct2017,2
21,"Hi, I'm a 14 year old boy and I think I'm losing my appreciation for nature. I like John Muir and his way of thinking, and I also have sort of an environmental philosophy too. I want to have a cabin in the Sierras and go skiing, hiking, backpacking, whatever. I think everyone should have a connection with nature. 

With this said, I currently don't feel like I have that connection anymore. Before I was so amazed and loved nature so much, and desperately wanted everything I mentioned above. But I fear I'm losing it. I feel like since I live in a civilization, it's pulling me in away from the thing I love. And it doesn't help that I live in Orange County (which is basically a desert). 

I want to continue to explore nature, but I feel like my family is holding me back. My family keeps making fun of my mindset, and it throws me off. I used to go hiking locally by myself without a phone (to force myself to ""be there"") but now my parents are making me take it everywhere I go so they can track me.

Anyways, I just want to preserve this sort of connection because it's vital. Some days I don't appreciate nature enough, and I never want to take days off from appreciating it because hey, don't I want to live in it? 

Does anyone have any suggestions?",20Oct2017,4
23,"I was browsing posts from /r/loseit, /r/keto, /r/ketogains, and /r/fitness today looking for some support by using the search bar. These communities are pretty established, so there was no shortage of posts that were perfectly relevant albeit 2 or 3 years old. I would skim through a post where the OP was struggling with some weight loss related challenges, and then head to the comments to see the discussion. Many posts contained something along the lines of “this is extremely difficult but I’m determined to meet my goals.” The interesting thing, though, is these users’ current flair showing up next to their names. For example, someone commenting 2 years ago “I’m struggling, I can’t seem to make progress past where I am now, I feel like I’ll be stuck here forever” would now have a flair next to their name saying “170 lbs lost.” It made me review some of my own posts and comments to remind myself that I’ve felt discouragement plenty of times before, and I’ll push past this too. Sometimes the best source of motivation is looking back on your own success! Even if you feel like you’re one of those “fail at life” type people, everyone has at least some successes and strengths they can reflect on. ",20Oct2017,546
24,"I’ve been thinking a lot about family, and more specifically, in the context of media. As far as how family does or doesn’t operate in my own life, I think I’ve refrained from seeing a connection that helps explain my approach to who I’ve let in my life and why. Let’s talk this out.

TV is reliable. For hundreds of episodes you can tune into the same faces. No matter the levels of betrayal or craziness, the characters return to each other. No one is ever *too* dimwitted or angry or caring or wacky. They serve a purpose and have a role. They play off and round out until you get a picture of something that persists. Modern Family is never going to seriously discuss divorce nor is Blackish ever going to have Dre wake up to a burning cross in his yard.

TV isn’t just reliable in that way, it’s what we flatten out with a rolling pin to make it easier to consume. Depression can be touched up by endearing quirks and not-too-off-color jokes. Obesity gets a backstory of excuses and room to understand. Entitlement sits at the head of an overflowing dinner table. Rage gets redirected towards off-screen or low-tier entities you’re not invested in. Every time a TV show tries to get “tough” and “deal with the real issues,” it is, by being designed, serving to undermine the stated goal in service to the reason it ever became such a powerful reflection in the first place. We care about the story, not the truth.

Think about what happens when a character dies. When a “beloved” character is ripped from our expectations, we revel in the surprise. Game of Thrones is nothing if not for its “shocking” deaths, now so numerous it’s a built in joke and expectation. If half the cast were killed in the opening episode of the new season, the show would go on. Our TV families are expected to go through everything so we don’t have to. Let them negotiate peace. Let them forgive. Let them cope.

TV is an indirect measure of where “we” collectively reside as a culture. The ever-expanding diversity of television and networks acts as though it speaks towards a measure of progress or that we’re hearing new and marginalized voices. I don’t think so. I think we’ve always been prepared to hear the black story, or gay story, or woman’s story, because the story absolves us of any real responsibility to any real relationship with someone who’s black, gay, or a woman. Somewhere, deep down, are more representations of different people a good thing? I think so. Is it the kind of work that traverses deep cultural divides and fosters togetherness? I think not even close.

There’s a weird irony constantly at play. The closer you look, and the harder you try to capture, the more likely you are to corrupt. I’m criticized for my “direct” nature. I hate dancing around pleasantries and speaking in code. People often think I don’t understand the kind of mistake I’m making. Our culture is predicated on that indirect approach. You don’t tell the girl you like her, you feign like you’re not interested. You don’t tell the boss to go fuck himself, you accomplish something that impresses the person above them. TV is a natural extension of this. You don’t make a gay friend, you reference something funny Cam said to signal you’re not an overt hater. You can’t be racist if you love watching Insecure.

The writers are usually trying to accomplish something real in any series that takes itself seriously. They lived those moments. They had those almost exact conversations. They didn’t have the lighting and the timing, but here’s as close an approximation to what happened when I came out at Thanksgiving, where’s my Emmy? But they wrote the episode. They lived it. They did the work, so you don’t think you have to.

It’s the indirect pose that I think gives us our baseline ideas regarding our own families. People put up with the worst kinds of abuses. They shoulder the responsibility when nothing is ever returned in kind. Family sticks together, right? Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood. At the end of the day, all you have is family. It works for the Mafia! If you weren’t paying attention. I was told growing up, “You’re brothers, you should love each other.” No doubt a sentiment passed to my father as earnestly as he tried to pass it onto us.

But where is the love? I don’t recall a single week my entire life me and my brother got along particularly well. My dad’s siblings have done everything in their power to resent and take advantage and steal from him. My mom was all forms of abusive towards him well before she got around to taking things out on us. But we’re family? Right? My dad and stepmom are currently shouldering the major portion of the fallout from my uncle’s recent cancer diagnosis. A task I wouldn’t put into the hands of any of his siblings were he on the receiving end. If it were an episode of TV, my dad would be the resilient everyman who’s capacity for forgiveness knows no bounds, and my uncle might see the light of his actions previously for just a second before dying off serenely surrounded by tearful, artfully suggestive of caring, family.

I tried to be more explicit in my concept and approach to “family.” I started picking friends. Where I screwed up was in the assumption family in and of itself meant anything, let alone that anyone would hold similar ideas to me as to how they would function. I think this is a major component to my confusion and frustration regarding my relative expectations about them. I had said out loud that they weren’t going to be playthings, they were different, I choose them to be as good or as bad as they are and we can all agree that *this is how it works*. I tried to cast a show that didn’t know it was filming. I directly dictated a puzzle that could only fall apart after it slid together while no one was looking.

Here I think about your “first love.” I certainly didn’t expect to be taken for a ride, and then I was on it. My “second love” did exactly the same thing, but it took a lot longer. I was paying attention this time. I was fighting back. The puzzle didn’t start with the edges and fill in quickly, it slipped a couple together here and a couple there until I saw a completed picture with nowhere to go but back in the box. It’s easy to be with someone when you’re letting whatever it is be. Then you turn them into your TV character with predictable, reliable, patterns to reinforce a feeling. That feeling has to be a good one, as I persistently learn my very presence instantiates negativity in many people.

Part of what I considered me “maturing” was adopting the ability to let people be who they were. The problem is when they don’t know, or don’t care, to figure out what they are. I’ve said a number of times that for as much of a roller coaster as I think I’ve put on display in blogs, “I” still remain “me” in some perverse impossible to nail down individuality. You’re not writing this, I am. It seems that the indirect habit applies as much to our own experience as much as anything else. We already know our eyes are a lie. We slowly lose the ability to hear and taste and smell. Why not forgo the mind it takes to pay attention and make choices? You don’t have to be you as long as you surround yourself with people telling you nice things about who you are.

I wanted to pick my family, but they had other plans. I still want the people I desire and look out for and heap endless praise and resources at to represent more than time spent in school together or partying or blood. And because I’m me, I know what I know and recognize what I’m after. I’ve done the work. I lay my TV characterizations of who you are to rest and try to engage the human who’s at least as convoluted and contradictory and confusing as I am. We have to be on the level. We have to choose each other. It’s an impossible and miraculous feat that most are barely willing to get a glimpse of.

The sickness is that you can attach yourself to an endless array of things and people that do nothing for you. They don’t help. They don’t teach. They don’t challenge. They leach while they let you leach. They hide you from yourself by making you all about them thus hidden in return. You can’t share with those resentful of you. You can’t save someone by cutting the noose when they’re dangling over a cliff. Here you get to make what you think is my fatal flaw. You pop into action and focus all of your time and energy. You advocate and celebrate and encourage. You take from the very finite yet always giving well of energy to keep the television on. 

I don’t feel like this often, but I’ve been ashamed to think that I think many of the people I care about, the ones I would consider family, are cowards. I’m usually immediately fashioned into some kind of “that guy” who’s coming in hot or “doesn’t get it” or is so stubborn I’m only able to undermine all of my best intentions. But I’ve given those ideas room to breathe. I’ve talked them to death and invited commentary. I can’t function as your character who represents the things you don’t feel you have the permission to say. It makes me feel cheap and inhuman, and it’s dishonest. I can inspire, but I can’t substitute. Just like all the “nice” people in my life I envy aren’t going to determine my attitude to new acquaintances.

When I think about the amount of times some relationship in my life has “failed” and put it in terms of who the person is verses who they’re projected to be, a lot makes sense. I’ve “failed” many fuck buddies by not blossoming into “husband material.” They used to be friends, but now they’re fuck buddies, because when I wasn’t “TV’s Steve,” they wanted nothing to do with me. By trying to accept certain friends as “who they are,” I came across as the overconfident judgmental blowhard who doesn’t leave room for anyone else to breathe as I offered scathing commentary about all of “them” out there, so how couldn’t I think those things about my friends as well? Our familiar familial connection turned to static. TV’s Steve doesn’t have friends and family. TV’s Steve is trapped in a time warp oozing Howard Stern in his 20’s energy. Off screen, we assume he’s okay with his books or his shows, wearily shaking his fist at the fall of man.

I’m not a character. More importantly, I’m not your character. I’m never going to treat you like you’re one of mine. I’ve chucked the longing and sentimentality and gone back into my selfish obnoxious preservation, but that doesn’t mean you’ve been demoted. That doesn’t mean I don’t suffer your cowardice or dishonesty in service to my attempted “maturity” with regard to our friendship. Because that’s just how you are, right? I say mean things, not you. Your brother is your brother, not me. Your story is the one you’re picking and fighting for, not a theme and skin that feel “good enough” for you to ride things out. You have things to say; you’re not a cordial parrot with teeth. Now there’s an animal fit for the screen.",20Oct2017,2

27,"I have already come to terms with not caring about labels when it comes to politics. I’m a woman and I like a few aspects of feminism. I wouldn’t call myself “bra burning.” I fully understand men are different than woman. I love Joe Rogan (in “triggered” the bit about being able to fuck up his wife and daughters is spot on. We are not all created equal. Bottom line), I love the “Guys we fucked” podcast and the show “Broad city.” And have a love hate relationship with the show “girls” (because Lena Dunham is insane in that show and IRL). I get women empowerment and I enjoy learning more about it. 

On the other hand. I voted libertarian. I love Ben Shapiro. I watch “louder with crowder” and dude cracks me up and makes absolutely perfect arguments. I also cannot deny facts. I think the topic of children being pumped full of hormones by their parents is insane because their child is going through a phase. But I’m not “conservative” because I am pro choice. 

I also have a love hate relationship with Stefan Molyneux. I learn a plethora of things from him. Especially r/K selection. That continues to blow my mind. 

Basically. I agree with aspects of different parties that vehemently disagree with each other. 

kind of as a disclaimer so people don’t roast me for using non political figures. I’m also still new at this. The last couple years I’ve started caring about these issues but I feel like I contradict myself based off the media I choose to follow. But I enjoy having all the facts out in front of me. 

I guess I’m just looking for someone to say they’re like this, educate me on anything I’ve said incorrectly or anything. I want feedback. I enjoy being open minded and each “side” is very interesting to me. 

If we can have a nice discussion I’d appreciate it. Also, I just rambled there so I’m really sorry if I sound stupid. ",20Oct2017,3

30,"Well. I guess the title is a bit excessive. Let's call it maybe ""Shit is shitty but it can still get worse"" or possibly ""Fuck this, fuck that, and fuck me."" One of those works, I'm sure. 

No matter the title, this portion of my life is bullshit and I think I'm bullshit for it.

Not too long ago I used to be someone who, even though times were rough and tough, could see the bright side of things and even usually see the forest for the trees. Every day was a new day to do something new, exciting, adventurous and even, dare I say it, enjoyable. After just a few short years in a big city I've become way more comfortable with who I am and where I live and even though the city has continually ripped away patches of my armor, I always find a way to fight back and regenerate. 

However, the past two years of my life have been nothing but the same thing every day, every week, every month, every everything. These days I tend to spend more time trying to escape from the reality I've built myself. More alcohol! (Stopped drinking) Cigarettes! (I can actively feel myself slowly dying) Weed! (Makes me foggy all day) Partying! Dancing! (Late nights, even more tired). Nothing is working. I still have to wake up and go to work, Mon-Fri, 9-5. No body told me to be here. No one told me to move here. No one told me to take up the dreams I have. I did. Me. I put myself on the path and vowed never to get off. 

Yet I find myself, instead of on the highway to victory, on the unpaved, winding, dusty service road that services the highway. Where I see endless people rush by on their way to happiness and glory. They're all going as fast as they can to get... to get... well to be honest I'm not entirely sure but they definitely have nicer places and more adventures, I know it because I can feeeeeel it. And see it. On the blackhole that is social media. 

So I sit here. Essentially chained to a desk that my actions have led me to. But why have my actions led me here? To be honest, mostly because I decided to go to college. (Then subsequently drop out. Never been able to call myself a college drop out before... god that hurts.) Oddly enough more experienced and intelligent than most people I work with, suck my dick /r/iamverysmart/ or at least that's how it feels sometimes. So I pay my endless student loan bills, because debtors prison sucks ass, and so do garnishments. It sucks being stuck in a place where I have endless responsibilities and zero power but endless expectation thrown upon me. Not even mentioning the measly wage.

I've tired of complaining to my friends. It's been the same thing for months now. So I'm hoping to find a way to let the steam out in other places. And maybe even up my writing game so I can maybe make one of those lofty dreams fall to a lower pedestal that I can jump onto.

So here's a toast to all of you out there who hate where they're at. Who work and work and work and still can't find a way out. Still can't find a way to be happy and pay all of the bills they need to so they don't go to prison. Here's to you. Hopefully we can find a way out. Cheers.",20Oct2017,2
31,"I've reported them every single time. Now they decided to create /u/getmoneysmokeweedfan to troll me with, at least I guess it is as I've acquired no other trolls. 

I could take the first hand trolling, but now they're escalating to insulting me third hand to get them to join in is where they're getting annoying. I've had a troll account, /u/getweedsmokemoney set up before which I didn't care about either. 

This all started because I told them to grow up and converse like an adult rather than just flinging insults at me for disagreeing. ",20Oct2017,3
32,"So after getting some surgery me and my mom stopped at Starbucks. I had to use the can. I forgot how heavy the Starbucks door was and since I just had surgery, pushing was not my forte. So when I had to leave I got stuck about halfway out the door and my mom had to rescue me. ",20Oct2017,3
33,"I live in Asia, in a place where online shopping isn't very popular, let alone shipping service. There are some books i wish to read and own in its original language, but sadly they are impossible to find here. So i was thinking if having these items, or books, sent through regular mail is feasible. Does this happen !? and if so, how to go about it !?",20Oct2017,3
34,"I am working on 2 films at the moment. I have a vast archive of imagery, sounds, etc. that I could use in either only one or in some cases both of those films. 


These folders are a lot of folders, categorized, and lots of files. I don't want to create a new folder called ""usable material"" and start moving files to there.


If there was something like the windows explorer that listed the files, and I could rate the material for the project, and switch between the ""projects"", it would help me a lot in categorizing this material.


I don't want to rate using the windows as it edits the metadata of the file itself, and I'd have to clear them one by one once I am done, which is a hassle.


Is there an application that could help me with this task?


Thanks.",20Oct2017,1
35,"Around 20 years ago, when I was maybe 15 or 16, I went to a local shop to grab something (I'm sure you'll forgive me for not remembering what exactly) and, while I was waiting in the queue, a woman walked in with 3 or 4 young children, probably ranging from 5 years old to 10 years old.

I assume the woman was deaf, or had some sort of speech problem, as the only sounds she made were (to me) unintelligible grunts. The children, however, seemed to know exactly what she meant and each went off to grab a different item from the mother's shopping list. They then returned and one of the children talked to the shopkeeper and paid for the items for the mother.

I probably watched a little too closely as I know the woman ended up noticing me. I smiled warmly (I hope) but I've always worried that I may have offended her, or that she thought I was staring in a rude or pitying way. She was probably used to people giving her strange looks but mine was honestly a look of pure amazement and respect for the fact that she, and her children, had learned to deal with things so well and had such a solid method of communication given the circumstances.

I'm not exactly sure why I decided to share this (although I think about it very often), and I'm certainly sorry if it comes across as rude or disrespectful in any way, but it really was an amazing sight. I still wish I could go back and not watch so closely, though, as I still think that she may have got the wrong idea.

While I've always been a fairly accepting and understanding person, that day gave me a little more appreciation for the struggles that people go through and how they overcome them and probably live as normal (after all, what is normal?) a life as anybody else.

I'd like to think I've carried that experience forward with me, too, and it has helped me accept people based not on their looks, or disabilities, but on their personality. I can definitely say that I know some awesome people who, if I were less accepting, I may not have the pleasure of knowing.

Again, I'm not really sure what caused me to post this (perhaps it was the few beers I had after finishing work) but, at the end of the day, I just want everyone to feel happy, loved, and respected. We all deserve at least those things.

I love you all. You're amazing, each and every one of you.",20Oct2017,9
