1,"Seeing a lot of cute Christmas present kitten and puppy posts on /r/awww, /r/pics, and elsewhere. I just wanted to remind everyone that animals are a commitment that takes a lot of dedication. They are also *expensive*. If you can't pay for a potential $2000 trip to the vey, please don't get a pet.

If you find that you can't care for a pet in a couple of weeks, *please* take it back to wherever you got it from or find a good home for it. Most places will take pets back no questions asked. If you abandon a pet in a field or by the side of the road, you are condemning them to an early death. 

That is all.",25Dec2017,112

6,At Thanksgiving I was shamed by my parent's friends and my Cousin's new girlfriend for pursuing my education at a state University. They also tried to convince me that trans people have no right to teach in a classroom. These sorts of things happen every family gathering so this year I will be leaving the house before anyone comes over so I can enjoy my night and not want to kill myself afterward. Anything to do on Christmas outside of arguing with terrible people?,25Dec2017,18

13,"Hey, first time posting here, never really posted anything like this but i think this is the best subreddit for it.
We're approaching the new year. Late December 2016, i made a couple of resolutions I really wanted to see through, not because i believe in the ''new year, new life'' shenanigans, but because I like to set myself goals and see how close i came of reaching them. Now after celebrating christmas (Happy wtv you celebrate btw), Im sitting here on this sofa self reflecting about what happened in 2017, which was definetly the year that shifted my life around the most.

My list of goals for 2017, in no particular order were:


(Ill go into details about them later)


* Get into University
* Go to the gym regularly
* Reach Diamond in Overwatch
* Get a stable relashionship
* Actually start writing the damn book
* Start looking better


**GET INTO UNIVERSITY**


- Now i must admit i didn't get into the course i really wanted, but i made it. My main goal was to get First Aid certificate so i could work in the summer as a life guard, that way i could get some money to help my parents in case i moved away to study what i really wanted.... Due to circunstances out of my control, i couldnt get the first aid certificate and no life guarding job in the summer for me. Now we still have financial problems and they couldnt afford me moving out of the city, so i ended up picking a course in my local University. I like it, its going well but only the future can tell if its going to be alright.


**GO TO THE GYM**


- This one went through, but i didnt get the result i wanted. I need to gain some weight. I'm 185cm and 72kg and i feel way to thin. I cant seem to bulk up and although i went to gym for 8 months straight i couldnt get any noticeable changes. I know the problem is in the diet, but i need to figure out a way to actually be able to eat more. I stopped going into the gym when i finaly got into university and stopped having time. But If i manage to get a new weight goal of 85kg, I'll try to make some time for it.

**REACH DIAMOND IN OVERWATCH**


- I actually did it... I've always loved gaming and anything related to it would be my dream job. So when i finally got diamond, and manage to stay there consistently, even though I cant dedicate as much time to the game cuz of the univeristy, it actually felt great.


**GET A STABLE RELASHIONSHIP**


- Although I'm 21 (nearing 22), I've never actually had a serious girlfriend. The longest relationship i've had only lasted 4 months and it was years ago. Girls tell me Im a funny guy and i never actually had any problems befriending people. However i just dont have that atractiveness factor. My main personality flaw is actually i can be quite over-confident at times, coming of as arrogant even. And even in my body, i feel like i want to bulk up and my face isnt the greatest. I really want to fix this area of my life, but i have no idea how to better it. My problem isnt really the getting a girl friend part, its the getting more intimate or maintaining it part.


**Actually start writing the damn book**


- Nope, still havent started it... I cant seem to write properly when im not inspired. And when i get inspired, its always to write about some new thing... I have a few poems saved up, cant really post it here since their on my native language, but what i really wanna do is start writing a book abotu a story i have inside my head for nearly 7 damn years. I have the characters and their personalities, the plot, main moments all figured out inside my head, but i cant get it into paper cuz I never feel inpired for long enough to want to keep writing the next day.


**START LOOKING BETTER**


- I do not feel attractive at all. All girls ive ever been with, all admited i won them over with time, after they got to know me and that attraction just built up. They never really found me good looking from the begining. I take care of my hygiene, I dont dress badly but i think my face is too damn big and my smile awkward. Here some pics for whoevers curious.
https://imgur.com/a/w9tol



Anyways, i wanna end this post, by marking my new goals for 2018. They are:
* Pass every class this year.
* Weight something like 85kg and then start hitting the gym again.
* Learn to write without being inspired
* Start looking better
* Get a stable Girlfriend
* Start learning a new language.",25Dec2017,1
14,"**Who Am I:**

Teenager male lol! Had an ex who basically saw me as a flavor of the month, broke up in less than a month, got stuck up on her for basically 7 months (I've been over her for a while now) in which time I grew more self-confident as a person. 

***

**Back to the past:**

I'm really good friends with ""Tom"" who has a twin ""Layla"". Tom and I have been in Boy Scouts for a couple of years so we were pretty close. The first time I saw Layla was at the end of summer camp and I thought ""holy shit she's gorgeous"" but later dismissed it as camp googles (having not seen a girl for an entire week, my calibration of beauty was a bit off)


**The Digits:**

 Eventually we were at a Boy Scout party as celebration of god knows what and I saw Tom and Layla there. Not having an newer iPhone (my family isn't too well off, lower middle class) I kept playing 8-ball on their phones on Game Pigeon. Eventually, I was like ""Hey, when I get a newer iPhone, let's play Game Pigeon, so can I get your numbers?"" Needless to say I got Tom's and Layla's numbers. Time went on, we went to different schools, didn't see Tom for a while as I moved to a boarding school far away from them and sort of forgot about them. 

**Reunion:**

That was until they came to my boarding school. Coming in, I made friends with them and we started playing Game Pigeon, starting a group chat to play Uno. As time went on, I got closer to them both, yet I sort of distanced myself as I recognized that I'm better friends with girls when I see them as friends and not a potential girlfriend ( I know shocker when I point it out, but you don't really recognize it until you point it out) Anyways, I got really close with Tom and Layla, both of them hanging out in my room often, just chilling, playing Uno, jamming to music, the usual. I also went to her room as well, but there were other people don't get any ideas ;) Also, I ate with them and their parents once, though I got baited because I thought her roommate was coming but she didn't. Anyways, finals happened and we're back home now. At this point, I increasingly grew to like her but was still repressing the thought as I didn't want to ruin our friendship.

**Break:**

So I go back to my home city, which is nice since we're both in the same city. I eventually make some excuse to go over to their house, and we do the same thing, just chilling, talking, me showing off my new HD650's (love these btw) and we played monoploy and had lots of fun. Anyways, I'm talking with my really close friend ""Christina"" (also a girl, for reasons we'll see later) and she tells me that Christmas lights are worth seeing. Christina has been my good friend for the past two years I've been here and I really never considered being in a relationship with her, which I accredit to our extremely close relationship. Anyways, growing up in an immigrant family, I wasn't really accustomed to American culture and never really went. She encouraged me to go and I was like sure, whatever. By this time, I've gushed to her about how I really like Layla. And at this point I guess she got annoyed and asked, why don't you just ask Layla out at the lights. After refreshing how to ask someone and me promising to Christina to tell her if Layla says yes or no, I said I thought I was good and end up texting Layla asking if she and Tom wants to go see the lights. She says she's down. 



**Christmas Lights:**

We end up driving there and while we're there Christina ends up confessing to me that she has liked me or at least she thinks she did and this has been for a while. I wanted to fully process this later so I put it in the back of my mind and kept driving. We parked and started walking around.  Eventually, we're at this huge Christmas tree. I take photos of Tom and Layla and eventually Tom and me take a photo and then it's me and Layla. Smiling there, gritting through my teeth, I attempted to ask her if she wanted to be my girlfriend. She didn't hear me, which I'm not surprised at all. I eventually ask Tom to go around to ask for a person to take our photo. While Layla and I were alone, I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend. She was visibly shocked and said that she would tell me later. We kept walking around and honestly the lights were gorgeous and it was a wonderful time. Driving back, I dropped them off and told her to not forget to answer my question.

**Another Wrapup:**

Back to Christina, I eventually texted her back, saying that I did not know whether Layla said yes or no and I'm glad the feelings were mutual, as though I did not see me and Christina in a relationship, I did have feelings for her and I'm glad they were mutual and that she was an amazing person and friend. 


**Finale:**

 Eventually I went to sleep and texted her saying that regardless of her decision, I still wanted to be friends. Waking up, I saw an extremely long text saying how she was conflicted as though she was glad that the feelings were mutual between us, she was concerned as to what to tell her parents and to tell Tom. But in the end, she said yes. I responded saying that we would work out it now and that she shouldn't worry about it now and just enjoy break.  So now I'm here. To say that this beautiful, wonderful, girl is my girlfriend is honestly amazing, yet I know we have many hurdles to go over, but it will work out somehow. Life worked out for me. Thanks for reading all of this yall &lt;3

This has been an absolute shit year, possibly the worst yet. But Reddit has always been there for me in all those tiny moments when I needed to be connected with something other than my reality. I’ve laughed, gotten very sad, met amazing people, seen some very crazy things, and most importantly learned a ton. I value the experience highly.

18,"London left this world about a month ago now. I knew he didn’t have long, and it was time for him to go. 

I’m glad I was there for him. Mine was the last face he saw and the last voice he heard. 

I used the tone he found comforting to let him know everything will be okay. And it was for him. I don’t think he’s “in a better place” or “alive” anywhere in spirit, but he’s simply gone. London is gone. And he is okay. 

Every day brings something new to remind me of him, and another wave of grief throws me off balance. Today marks the first Christmas without him to cuddle next to me as I open my gifts by the fire. He liked it when I put them near his face so he could investigate them further. 

I know most people think it’s immature or dramatic to speak of and feel this way for a simple cat, so I can’t talk about this to anyone. They wouldn’t understand. He was always so much more than a pet to me though. 

I loved him more than anything.

My extremely conservative and Christian mother had gone in to see what my cat was making such a fuss for and my butt plug was sitting less than 2 feet from her. 

I saw it, panicked, shoved the door to the cubby closed as quickly as I could and got my mother out of my room as quickly as I could.

Makes us die too early to see enough technological advancement, makes space too big and light speed too low for us to meet aliens or for them to meet us.

23,"almost two years ago my wife and i got a kitten. i work healthcare hours so i get 4-5 days off a week and spent a lot of time and he and i instantly bonded. my wife and i are absolutely obsessed with this cat and everyone knows it. his name is Jones after Ripley's cat from Alien. 

At the end of the summer my wife and i went on vacation for a week and boarded our cat while we were gone. he got incredibly sick after being there and required antibiotics all and was slow to recover after losing a lot of weight. He regains his appetite and acts pretty much back to normal for a while after. we leave to go away for a wedding (its rare we leave him multiple times) and after he got sick we boarded him at a much more expensive place that ensured separation from other cats so he wouldnt catch something like he did before from being mixed with other cats.

We took him to get a vaccination right before we left and the vet tech said they would have expected him to gain more weight back since being ill a few months ago. We scheduled an appointment and i considered staying behind for the wedding but the plane tickets were purchased and all. 

We take him at the first appointment when they get back and on the doctors exam she says she can feel a small mass near his intestines. she says she hopes that its nothing but it felt quite bad. since hes not even 2 yet though we decide to remain optimistic but scheduled an ultrasound and aspirate two days later. we are DREADING this ultrasound and what it could mean for my best friend (i dont say that lightly).

we take him to the ultrasound and it goes about as bad as possible. our vet and the vet who specializes in radiology both think it looks like a cancerous mass but were going to send away for cytology(biopsy).  im at work when they tell me this with my wife on speakerphone crying in the vet office. i dont think i really comprehended it and ended up going to the bathroom to put water on my face a few times throughout the shift.

our vet advises we schedule an appointment with a veterenary oncologist ASAP to at least discuss options. we make the appointment and go home to cry and talk. we both look at our empty bank accounts and our shit paychecks and wonder how we be able to do this. 

we take him to the appointment and they get the cytology results while we are there. the doctor talks to us about how treatment can reduce symptoms but average length of life with high grade lymphoma is anywhere from 2-8 months. we are absolutely devistated and they say they want to start him on a steroid and chemo immediately. my wife and my eyes meet as they discuss how average chemo cost is around 2000 dollars, bare in mind this is the week before xmas. they say this then discuss how if he responds to it, it will drastically reduce his symptoms until he eventually stops responding to the medication. we are in tears this talking about what they have for payment options and the vet tech says one second she'll be right back.


we are sitting in the lobby with our cat and we're both in tears waiting. she comes back and says that she went to the back and they were able to find a 30 day dose of the same chemo medication for a dog that died and the owners had donated the medication. she says they were also able to find a month supply of the steroid too. at this point i dont think ive really shed tears mostly just comforted my wife. but when she says that she will be able to GIVE these to Jones and all we have to pay is the vet fee(115 dollars) i absolutely lost it.

There is nothing harder knowing that there is nothing i can do to stop what is going to happen to my kitten. Theres nothing i could have done to prevent it, theres nothing to do to keep him another 18 years like i hoped. Jones is going to die. (fuck hard to type)

But the Christmas Miracle isnt for me, it isnt for my wife either. The miracle is for Jones. No matter what we wanted to do we would not be able to afford the chemo for Jones. It wasn't fair that we wouldnt be able to make Jones as comfortable as possible. Somehow somebody who had lost their pet at the worst time of the year thought to donate their medication. and by doing that they were able to give Jones a much better start to feeling his best for his remaining time with us. Jones will still go, but at least he will start to gain weight and feel less tired. 

i know that this may make losing him in the end harder, the fact that he will show some signs of improvement before his eventual demise. but i can take some solace knowing that because of this christmas miracle jones will have a better holidays.

24,"It’s Christmas, and I’m 20. I have no siblings, I don’t talk to my Dad, and I have a mother and a step-dad that is really old fashioned and isn’t really an outlet. My Mom is so sweet and she bought me so many gifts this year and labelled them all from Santa. It’s awesome. However, I noticed that I felt nothing. This is nothing like when I was a child. This is kind of scaring me, and I even feel this way about my birthday or things like going on trips. Everyone around me can celebrate for my birthday and I feel nothing. What the fuck is wrong with me? I have a loving girlfriend, a loving and supportive Mom, a flexible job where I can pursue my passions and it pays ample. Why am I like this? I feel fucking dead. What happened?",25Dec2017,4
26,"It’s 17 minutes before Christmas, and all through the house, two creatures are stirring, each the size of a mouse.

I feel the buzz of the holidays. (Christmas, for you non-heathens). I can feel people trying to loosen up. The radio station is blaring the “wrong” version of the Christmas song I thought I knew better. Being in The Region, I’ve gotten to contend with a perfectly timed snow storm  ensuring the whitest of Christmases. Of course, the setting is right, the food is delicious, and the company I don’t care to talk to is just as happy to not talk to me either. It couldn’t get better.

In the spirit of the holiday, let’s try excruciately hard to write with that upbeat contented smile you see from all of the family pictures hitting the feed.  If I want to get into a “sensitive” or “negative” topic, I’ll take extra care in showing that it’s not so bad and there’s a way out. Just because I want to write, after all, doesn’t mean you need to suffer. I won’t grab the back of your head and beat your face against the screen until you’re paying the right kind of attention, like I did all those other times.

When you cut out the magic sky baby stuff, I believe the spirit of the season is about giving.  Just because we’re living in the throes of the Republican cult giving your future away to big business, doesn’t mean you can’t devote your time and attention to people and causes worse off than you. With so many simultaneous things going wrong though, it can be hard to figure out just what it looks like to be an effective giver. To care so much, or to try in earnest, can get exhausting. Rarely are we given the tools, or prone to the discussions, that see our best efforts become manifest.

Historically, I haven’t been the best at accepting gifts. People being nice to me feels...off. This doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate them. This doesn’t mean they are wrong for doing so. There is nothing inherently bad about buying gifts for someone or feeling yourself compelled to get me one. But, I have everything already. I can think of no greater gift than to be listened to and understood and to see and hear your thoughts in how or whether they motivated you to get involved or speak up. I want what is rarely on offer and I mostly tend to ask for it in blogs. I, of course, need extra hands for the dirty work, but if wants aren’t particularly forthcoming, needs slipped out the hole in a back pocket.

Not everyone is as simple as me. Very few people will genuinely believe themselves if they say, “Don’t get me anything.” Well, perhaps it’s easier to believe it when you’re older and are sick off all the crap you’ve accumulated. Slight difference for me personally too, I can always use money, and it’s why that’s always been my gift since around the age 13. But still, simple. Not everyone is a position to always know what they need either. You can genuinely surprise a child with a toy they never knew they wanted. The clothes they unwrap might be their favorite thing to wear one day.

What about bigger scale? What about the giant donations to impoverished areas? What about the money being slipped into the boxes with jiggling elves? These are opportunities to give back and feel good. These are a show of solidarity to the underlying caring human spirit that always has a little change to spare. Considerably more is known today about which charities actually turn money into well-being for who they’re advocating for so you don’t even have to feel guilty if you skip right past The Red Cross. Much has been studied about the impact of cheap clothing donated to areas who eschew a local economy in anticipation of the U.S. scraps.

I can feel myself getting all over the place. That’s sort of the point. The “spirit” of the time of year isn’t any one song, one present, one dinner or favorite movie. It’s not in the passing deference to the Jews or jokes about Kwanzaa. It’s not the snow and other assorted imagery. It’s the overwhelming all-at-once force of culture that wraps up the willing in a comforting blanket of warmth and positivity, and pushes the lonely and the suicidal over the edge. It’s the power of a collective narrative. It’s the spell of togetherness.

There’s so much talk about the “divisive” age we live in. I think this, as with most things, is precisely backwards. When a “side” manifests, it’s precisely because people are rallying behind something. The energy they don’t know what to do with rallies in spite of themselves. As such, it can work in service to things that actively harm themselves. You cheer for sports teams where none of the players are from where you live. You fall for TV shows for their hype and meme-ability. Christmas and Hanukkah aren’t in competition, dividing up the faithful. One “side” just doesn’t bother to care enough about their immortal souls.

No narrative wins until it gives people a focal point. After that adoption, it can spiral off into the myriad ways people personally interpret everything. I’ve asked before, what did Obama’s “hope” get us but the chance to ignore the millions willing to vote for Palin in any capacity. It was truly the re-reading of the “argument” I got into about Twin Peaks, and the seeking out of a few other negative reviews, the pushed me over the edge to start writing this. My biggest issue with the show is its fundamental lack of coherent narrative that makes it incredibly boring. The hardest core advocates turned disenfranchised make passing praises to the initial mystery and individuality it had in 1991, but don’t have any more a clue than I do why it continued after the narrative wrapped in the middle of season 2. People keep seeing what they want to see.

The hardest core continuing fans, like those most in love with Christmas, like the intimately familiar with fighting injustice, prop up their preferred narrative. It doesn’t have to be completely devoid of reality, and it doesn’t mean there’s no utility in doing so. But you have to recognize it’s a narrative. It’s a spell just like any other. It’s the same spell that makes me “negative” before we ever start talking or you recognize anything I’ve actually said. It’s a spell that *knows* every quarter or dollar you drop into the box is going towards helping someone and not corrupt leadership or advertising. It’s undying faith in your team colors, because nothing about how they make their money erases the fun you had attending games with your dad as a child.

I wish that everything you give or get can be done in earnest. I don’t want holidays to be taken for granted anymore than any other day. I don’t want you to rate your time together like a show designed to trap mindless dupes who’ve invented a 10/10 narrative to supplant the soupy malaise of incoherent writing. If you want something, ask for it, work intelligently towards it. If you have nothing to give, don’t force it, keep yourself from sacrificing your truth for a worse story. If you don’t know where you reside, in your family, in life, start talking and asking questions. Give yourself the kind of gift that Santa can’t bring. Be a charitable force of time and attention. In my experience, it’s the only thing that’s kept me remotely sane or bothering to carry on in spite of my overwhelming capacity to complain or break things down. It’s also the only force I see that we can rally behind in trying to piece back the fabric of reality that’s been obliterated by our access to so many competing narratives.

27,"This is a long one. Hang on to your santa hats.

So I’m staying at my sisters house for Christmas. This is an especially hard time for our family and my sister especially, as her husband just recently passed after a long battle with cancer. This will be the first Christmas without him, so we’re doing Christmas at their house to make sure the house is full of love and family!

My mom/dad and other sister and her husband/kids are all in town too, staying at a nearby hotel. I’m the only one of us staying in the house, as they only have one small guest room and I’m the only sibling without a spouse and kids to need more space.

Last night, my sister (14 yrs my elder - she’s the oldest and I’m the youngest) and I️ stayed up wrapping until 2AM, so that tonight would be chill.  All that we had to do tonight was “eat” Santa’s cookies, write a thank you note from santa (they leave out a pen and paper), and then put out the gifts under the tree.

Here comes the hailstorm.

All three of my sisters kids are asleep, and my sister falls asleep putting them to bed. I️ know the drill, and I️ think it would be nice to let my sister sleep peacefully with the kids — she’s had a hard few months. I️ go downstairs to do the quick deeds. I️ crumble the cookies, put a few back in the tin, make a convincing show of it! I️ go to the laundry room to do a cycle so there will be less to do for my sister tomorrow. I’m about to go into the garage to get the hidden presents, just off the laundry room, when my sister’s eldest (12F) walks up behind me.

“I️ heard a noise down here!”

I️ say “oh! Just me! Down here doing laundry! Go back up to bed!”

On the way back to the stairs she notices the cookies are gone. She runs to the plate, and sees there is no note on the paper. She looks at the tree, and sees there are no magic presents. She bolts upstairs to her room.

This all happened so incredibly quickly — I️ text my mom at the hotel, asking for advice.  She had 5 kids, so she must have solid experience, and I’m very close with her. I️ explain what happened, and ask if I️ ruined Christmas?

I️ follow 12F upstairs and hear her crying in her room. I’m texting my mom, trying to get up the courage to wake my sister who’s asleep with the littler ones. Thinking maybe I️ could play it off as I️ was hungry and ate Santa’s cookies and was going to put more out before I️ went to bed.

All of a sudden, 12F comes out of her room and tosses my mom’s iPad at me, and says she’s been reading all my messages.

PANIC AUNT MODE. TRAPPED WITHOUT MY SISTER, her mom.

She sits next to me, crying, and I️ hold her and comfort her. She says she really needed to believe he was real and that she’s not ready to not be a kid anymore and that I️ ruined Christmas for her.

I’m trapped and can’t stop thinking how I’m not supposed to have this conversation with her - her mom is.

I️ do some quick thinking and explain (how I️ would were I️ to have children), that santa is the embodiment of Christmas spirit in your family and your friends, and how being an adult is the best part because everyone works together to make the holidays a magic time for kids and for everyone they love.

She is sad, but nods, and eventually walks away — directly to wake up my sister. They go into 12F’s room and shut the door. Lots of crying and talking and crying.

My sister did a healthy thing and involved 12F in setting out Santa’s gifts.  Explained how next year was going to be so great because now she’s in on it and she’ll have so many more creative ideas of what to do for Christmas surprises and secrets.

Then 12F went back to her room, and sister and I️ got a chance to talk.  She’s livid. Understands it was an honest mistake but is furious the secret was broken. And is very upset that I️ had texted our mom asking what to do instead of immediately waking her up.

APPARENTLY backstory there is that my late BIL and she thought it was important to keep up as long as possible, and it obviously got harder as she got older (she’s in grade 7 now) but they stuck it out.  But now that he has passed, she feels she “failed” to keep up the game.  And apparently for several years our mom has been hinting it’s “gone on long enough” and that they should tell her soon, so the fact that I️ had texted mom just makes that old rift worse. In my sister’s words: “she’s the last person who would have sound advice on breaking the news.”

I️ feel awful. I️ honestly don’t know how to go forward with tomorrow. For my niece, who now has to keep up the “santa secret” for her younger brothers. For my sister and mom, who are going to be at odds about the events.

It was all a whirlwind nightmare 30 minutes of my life I️ wish never happened.

TLDR: accidentally let out the secret that Santa’s not real to my niece; inadvertently broke a promise that my sister kept with her late husband.",25Dec2017,11

30,"I'm 26M and I've been in my fair share of terrible/emotionally abusive relationships (being cheated on, dealing with an alcoholic who tried to close her trunk on my head, and plenty more). I've been choosing the wrong people my whole life, and I'm only to blame- I'm very good at seeing red flags, and I've always noticed them early on but overlooked them for the sake of making it work/seeing the good in them. Maybe that mixed in with low self esteem in those times.

I recently met a girl and for the first time I really think I got it right. It's still relatively early on so who knows, but so far everything about her seems so right for me. I keep on asking myself ""what's the catch?"" and she keeps on being even more awesome. She's kind, thoughtful, smart, funny, and beautiful. I can talk to her for hours and smile the whole time. No games, no jealousy, no manipulation. The weirdest part is all this praise I'm singing is the type of stuff I always thought was tacky or exaggerated, but for the first time, I truly, TRULY feel this way.

All my past relationship failures were important lessons in my life, and throughout this year, I feel like I've reached a place where I know my worth. I stopped going after problematic people and it's finally paying off. I'm really happy and I hope it works out with this relationship. Even if it doesn't, I was happy with being single before this, I entered this relationship knowing I'll be okay no matter what, and I really believe it.",25Dec2017,4

Its so fucking annoying that you think WAY to much about saying something and thinking on how to say something in public.
For context, ive had this since roughly 7~8 years old and i am now 19 years old. Aye messed up i know.
But i want to get rid of this bad point of mine but i am just lost on how.

Everyone who knows me, knows how close I am with my best friend Braden Oliver. The past 14 years himself, Barbara, Collin and Brenna have become my second family. As much as it pains me to see anyone go through cancer let alone terminal cancer, which is what Colin is currently dealing with, it's at stage 4 and nothing can be done at this point - they don't have jobs, and can't afford their weekly bills. it especially hurts to have people who I love and care about struggle with everything that is going on. 
I've made a give-a-little page to help the family get through everyday needs and help with gas needed to travel to and from Invercargill Kew Hospital. - which is over 100kms away, and they need to be traveling there multiple times a week. Any donations or even words of comfort and support will be so helpful, and a blessing to the family.

41,"Last year I used the Konmari method to simplify my life.  It worked beautifully.  My closet only has the clothes I like and I pared down my book and DVD collections to just what I care about.  Sweet. 

But, a year on, I still feel overwhelmed by visual clutter.  Still have three full bookcases,  still end up with my walk in closet becoming a clutter magnet.  

I have approximately 600 sq ft of living space and even with reduced possessions,  I'm not happy. I still feel boxed in.  If I lived in a place with an extra room, I'd set up a proper office/library. As it is now, my bedroom is also my office, my craft room, where I practice my instrument, my library, and my workout space. I walk in my bedroom at night to sleep, see all the pending projects littered around me and this ball of stress just grows and festers.

They say your bedroom shouldn't be a multipurpose room just for that reason,  but when you live in a small space with roommates, what can you do? 

I'm on the verge of renting a storage shed, something I told myself I'd never do. I don't want to.  The possessions I have left are all stuff I care about and want to keep, not lock away (at extra cost). But I don't know what to do.  

There's a chance I'll be moving next year,  but if I do,  it'll be an even smaller place.  The thought of having to move all this stuff and still having nowhere to put it makes me want to cry.",25Dec2017,4

47,"I've been thinking about this for a while and it's been really bothering me lately. Eg. Someone makes a one word pun then later on adds ""Edit: OMG thanks for all the likes"" or ""Edit: well this is my most upvoted comment now"". I don't know what it is about these sorts of things but something about it really infuriates me. Bonus points if they do several edits thanking people for up votes. For things like thanking people for upvotes on an original full post or thanking someone for gold I find it understandable but on comments. Oh my God I hate it so much. Maybe because it's just a low effort thing most of the time and people think they deserve recognition for it. Come to think of it, when people thank others for upvotes on a well thought out and high effort comment then I don't mind it either. I guess that must be it then. On a somewhat related note, I also hate when people use over used Reddit sayings as edits for comments. Eg. 'Edit: thanks for the gold stranger"" or stuff like that. Over used comments too like saying ""r/somesub would love this"" piss me off too. Anyway I'm getting pretty off track now.

50,I used to love Christmas as a kid but as I've gotten older it's now reached a point this year where I hate it. I woke up today just feeling so sad which surprised me. I'm really lonely. I'm supposed to go to some relative's for dinner but I think I'm going to cancel. I had trouble sleeping too so I'm so delirious from having so little sleep. My mom is going to be furious with me for cancelling which is just going to make everything even worse. I hate this time of year. I think next year I'm not even going to celebrate it.,25Dec2017,10

53,"She's high-functioning autistic. I've been supporting her completely and independently the last five years. My parents did very little to grant her the path towards independence, never got her on any ssi benefits, never taught her much about how to be independent (i.e. cooking, money management, etc). Myself, I've had to pretty much learn on my own, but I have also been teaching her about the last year or so all that I know and then some. 

This year, I've been advocating for her, and basically raising her, as if she were my own child. It's been emotionally draining, and as much as I love her, there are days that I don't understand how I can manage anymore of this. (To those who parent anyone with autism--high or low functioning--I salute you!) 

Well, this month, she finally got approved for ssi benefits for the coming year(s)! This will be such a relief for my husband and I, as she can support her portion of the rent, and I can finally teach her how to handle her money like other adults must do instead of just giving her 20 or 40 bucks a month to fuck around with. 

Anyways, her Christmas gift to me was this:
""Thank you for supporting me the last few years. I know I don't say it often, but I do appreciate it.""

That is the first time she has ever given me appreciation for all the work I've had to do since the age of 18 that my parents couldn't have been bothered with all throughout our childhoods. 

I love you so much, sissy. I wish I could hear you say the same sometimes, but I know the love is there. You mean everything to me. 
Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays, everyone. ",25Dec2017,631
