It's amazing the sorts of mind-viruses that can embed themselves in your psyche.

A little under a year ago, I met with a group of longtime friends for a week. One of them wore a shirt with the classic phrase ""the beatings will continue until morale improves."" Except it didn't say ""beatings.""

It said ""beathings.""

The typo was kind of amusing, and my friend wore the shirt anyway. I commented that the word sounded kind of interesting. It was pleasant to the tongue.

Beathing. Rhymes with breathing, but the absence of the R makes it soft and cozy.

Beathing.

It became something of an inside joke that lasted the duration of the week we were all together. We had a google calendar set up, and one of us changed the name of an event to ""beathing."" It was funny.

Beathing.

If one of us made an unusual sound and someone asked what we were doing, the answer was obvious.

Beathing.

The week came and went, and the joke persisted. Eventually, in-line with my personality, I took the joke beyond humor. I insert the word where it makes no sense. I conjugate it. I will beathe air when you need me. I will beathe a one who listens in your time of need. Please don't beathe hiss way.

For a while, I thought I was providing comic relief to my friends. After a few months, I realized I was providing relief for myself. Beyond that, this made-up word had engulfed my stream of consciousness.

I would talk to myself when I was alone. ""What am I doing today? I am beathing. Where am I beathing? Beathing. Beathing.""

It would loop. For hours and hours, ceaselessly. I came up with a definition for the word. Want to know what beathing means? It means to say the word ""beathing"". That's it. It's recursive.

In January my boss asked me what I was working on. She had a project she wanted to assign to me when I was free. I told her I was beathing. I didn't even register what I'd just said. ""Huh?"" she asked. I told her I was completing the assignment she'd given me the day before. Decided it was best to pretend I wasn't beathing.

In the time since that incident, it's happened at least thrice more. She became upset this morning when she thought I was trying to play a joke with her. I'm worried I'll have to come clean and explain that I've been beathing due to my mind-virus.

I don't want her to know I've been beathing. It might make me sound crazy.

My brain superimposes the word over similar words when I hear people speaking in shows. If a character says they are breathing, I hear that they are beathing. Did they take a savage beating? No, they took a savage beathing. The definition comes with it. I assume that they were saying the word. It's difficult to break free.

I can't stop beathing. I mutter the word when I'm alone. I'm sure people can hear me. I'm sure my friends know I'm beathing. Should I be ashamed? Should I be proud that I beathe? Should I hide it? What do I do?

I am beathing. I am beathing. In my mind, I am always beathing.

2,"I was swimming in the pool late last night and I saw a mother duck quacking away outside of the pool gate. Curious I proceeded to enter the pool and was astonished to see 6 ducklings swimming in a V formation in the pool like a perfectly racked game. They of course were frantic to see me and it was late and dark so I backed away and let the mother rejoin her ducklings. 

I then noticed that she was trying to help them surmount the pool wall to get out but the little ducklings were unable to make the jump. She repeated this maneuver a few times, entering the pool, leading them to the wall, hopping out only to be dismayed hat her little ducklings, try as they might, couldn't escape the pool. 

She then, apparently, gave up and left the pool again. The poor little ducklings peeped and chirped in their high pitch tones seemingly in anguish to be left alone. I hesitated to help, but seeing no sign of rescue from their mother I ventured forth.

I first tried to make a ramp out of a long piece of cardboard. This of course failed miserably as it just soaked up the water and became useless. 

I then tried a pool lounge chair which looked like it would be effective but the ducklings were too afraid or unaware to be able to use it.   I tried to herd them towards it but they would only hide beneath it or dive a few feet under water in a frantic effort to get anywhere but near me.

Finally I settled on using my hands, even though I feared my grip would hurt the little guys. I went for them one by one, reaching out with a gentle but firm grip, scooping them up and plopping them onto the side of the pool. The first ones were the biggest pain, they slipped out, darted under the water away from me, and scurried much faster then I could swim (yes I was in the water with them at this point). But after the first three I got the hang of it. 

One by one they were plopped onto the pool edge. Fat and light they bounced and instantly ran hurriedly towards their mother who was waiting in the bushes near the gate. 

I felt immense satisfaction after they were all safely returned to mother intact, and the little tribe waddled off. 

I swam my laps afterwards and I swear I felt lighter.

4,"##Thus spoke the pessimist child of Zarathustra:

Friends, beauty. Run after every word, every little thing. Can't you see, I may never see them again? I will be dying soon, don't get attached to me, or maybe do and we can cry together until I pass. See her smile, see her dance, so beautiful, so happy, so naïve. I can hear the scream in the background of my mind. ""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!"". So much agony.

And in the realm of regrets. Why have regrets? Never have regrets. Creating regrets as you die, unaffordable.

Some could say animals are the happiest beings, not a care in the world. Their total indifference, or their complete empathy for a world they do not understand. Their look of curiosity for every movement, all forgotten when food comes. And when they're sleepy, they sleep. But they can never see it coming, the suffering, and when it comes they can't understand it, and when they can't understand it, they cannot leave it in the back of their minds. It's always there, this unknowable anxiety, this world that pricks them and makes them hurt so much that they can bite themselves to death. Is that Paradise or Hell?

But humans are not so blessed in comparison. After we're born, after we grow just a bit, we learn that nothing lasts, that we are all going to die, that anything we do will be futile, that life is for the pleasures within, not for the pleasures after (although some religions want to take this pleasure away, making a human's life miserable from its beginning until its end in the name of sacrifice).

The black crows are always cawing in the background. You just have to listen. The future is coming and they herald its arrival as they open their wings and fly above your head.",08Jun2017,1

14,"So here is my long and convoluted story Reddit I hope you can help.
I entered into a lease with two other people on a house. Everything was going pretty smooth up until the end of our lease here which just ended in June. The two that were living here paid their part of the rent and I paid my part of the rent and split utilities as well. We all had logins to the utilities so we would log in on our own to pay for electric, gas, and water, I paid for the internet. Well in January they wanted two other people to move in that they trusted that said they could Pay their bills. I reluctantly said yes to this situation and they moved in I figured I could save some money. Well they could not afford to pay their rent every month and did not pay their utilities. The gas had been shut off, electric got shut off as well as water. I was confused because I would log in and pay my part of the utilities on a pretty consistent basis. Well come to find out I was the only one paying on a regular basis and all the bills were stacking up like crazy. Luckily only one of them was in my name so I was able to get that sorted out pretty easily.

Well it turns out everyone decided to move out the two that moved in later were not on the lease so I did not really care to much about that and they never paid on time anyway. My big concern is this. The two that were on the lease dipped out without paying rent which now comes to a grand total of about 1700 dollars. On top of that I also had to cover the cost of all the cleaning supplies for the house because the house was a complete disaster. I spent so far about 300 on cleaning supplies and still have a few more things to get and a trip to dump to make. They also owe me for the Water bill as well which was never paid by them.
The two in question have now been out of this house for more than 60 days and left quite a bit of stuff some stuff that is actually worth a bit of money.

So my question is this reddit! Do I take them to small claims court and what all can I file against them. The Rent, Utilities, Cleaning Supplies, can I also sue them for the time I had to take off work to clean the house? Also at this point since they have been gone for 60 days and I have messaged them asking me to pay them and all they replied and said was they will pay me when they can so can I at this point get rid of their stuff(we are in the state of Missouri) I actually ended up talking to my landlord and she is a sweetheart and has been helping me with this whole situation and she really likes me because I am the one in our house that always communicated with her and told her if there was an issue. And when this all happened I was very upfront with her and told her what was going on and she has worked with me every step of the way. So now I am the only one on the lease but they still have house keys to this house so if they enter the house now is that considered breaking and entering?

The most annoying thing is that I would have still gone out with him if he put 5' 6"" but instead of being prepared I was instantly hit with the feeling of being duped. And he kept going on about how he has been catfished before so he's always truthful about everything on his profile. I just wanted to tell him how I thought he was 5' 10' but that obviously wasn't true.

38,"Using a relative's​ extra account.

For some context:

Up until 2014, me and my parents were good. Until my father died that year, we never really had any problems. Things started to get bad financially during during highschool but we were able to pay tuition, thankfully. 

During my 4th year I discovered alcohol. I was okay with it and I guess when I started to drink, I started to go out more with friends. My mom was really strict with this though. I started questioning her way of thinking. I also concluded that year I didn't want anything to do with religion. Unfortunately my mom is extremely religious. 

We would have fights about it since U wanted to convert. I left one night and came back the next day. 

We would then proceed to have numerous fights over the course of a few months.

-------------

Anyways, I'm in college now. Drinking​ more than ever. My grades are fine, I didn't fail any subjects. But I feel that I don't really talk to my family anymore. I'd much rather be with friends. I think its because I have nothing in common with my family. I'm the black sheep.

She's getting used to me going out a lot. And I was happy with that. I'd just stay in my room at home day till night, only coming out to get food or water then I'd immediately go back inside. But my mom makes me go to their room for the nightly prayer. I don't really listen.

We had a fight today. I was supposed to go to a highschool friend's house (for drinks and a 2k tournament). I didn't have any money since I had to pay the remaining balance for my tuition the week before. I tried to ask my mom for money. She said she didn't have any so I just went to my room to find just enough money to be able to go to my friends house and back home the next day. I was getting ready and my mom got mad. She said that I should just stay since I barely had any money but I insisted. She started the whole conversation about saving money again and I told her that I should have the freedom to spend my money freely. She got angry. She also noticed that some shoes she bought me were messy and said that I should take care of them.  I didn't really wear them since they were fake and I'd get made fun of at school. She cried and got angry because she said that I should treasure the thing she worked hard to buy. I only really felt bad for that one. 

She said that Instead of going out with my friends, I should just stay at home. She told me that she felt like I'd rather be with friends than my family, which I did. ""God&gt;Family&gt;Friends"" she said loudly. I'm not really sure if I even really believe in God. I just want to convert since I dislike their mentality. All of them are elitists, and as I said previously, I'd rather be with friends.

For another year, we were still very close friends, as we had known each other for a couple of years prior to dating. I know people say you can stay friends after you break up, but I really believed we were the exception to the rule, and for long time we were. 

But then she got into a big fight with my best friend (over completely unrelated matters) and I started distancing myself from her because I felt like she had been completely unfair to my best friend. Well, she distanced herself from me too, and it's been six months since I've spoken with her. 

It took me a long time to get over her, at least in the sense of not being ""in love"" with her anymore. I know that we would never have worked out in the long term. I've accepted that.

However, I can't help but miss her. At least, I'm pretty sure this is just me missing what we had, both in the relationship and the friendship. It's cliche to say, but we had a real connection that I thought could never be severed. We could talk about anything and be totally open with each other. After her fight with my best friend, I began to see her differently (I don't want to go into the specifics of the fight). 

She's in a new relationship now and I felt a twinge, not because I want to be back with her, but because I know that person probably has that kind of connection with her that we had and have probably now lost. I have other friends and everything, though I haven't dated since we split up. But I haven't felt nearly as close to anyone else as I did with her. I can't find anyone else I'm nearly as comfortable around.

I know that no two relationships or friendships are the same, but I just miss feeling as close and comfortable with someone as I did with her. We used to talk everyday, or at least most days. It's been six months. Sometimes I think about messaging her, but I'm afraid. Of what, I don't know. 

Since I haven't been able to forge a strong and close connection with anyone else since her, it's the reason I miss her. I'm not really sure what to do. I've been trying for so long to get over it. I wasn't sure what sub to post this in but I just had to get it out somewhere because I'm too embarrassed to talk to my friends about it.

I have things to say that I really care about, I want to touch the hearts of people give them hope and make them think about more deep things and feel emotions they have never felt before. I want to belong in a big community, travel around the world and share feelings through music. However, Kazakhstan is not the best place for musicians especially if you sing in English and have an original style. I don't have any musicians in my family, had no idea of music before 16 years (I got interested when I discovered 30 Seconds To Mars and a great dreamer Jared Leto). I learned guitar and piano in a relatively short time. Created some songs, learned producing it, created songs with guitar and performed them. Opinions about my singing voice are mixed, I think most of the good feedback are lies, but I started not long ago and still training. The financial state of my family is not the best, my only brother is married and has his own family to care about. My parents work day and night through sweat, blood, and tears. So it leaves me a great responsibility to have a good education have a stable job with good income as soon as possible. I understand that and never told my family about my dreams, they don't even know that I can sing or performed anywhere (I study in another city). When I mentioned it slightly as an option they get frustrated, so I'm 100% sure they would not tolerate this idea, they have a bad experience with a ""dream followers"". Almost every time I share my dreams with friends they like ""I don't think that's a good idea or this is not rational"" and show a confused face or looking to me as a naive princess, just never share them until you totally trust the person. Nevertheless, I'm very honest with myself I want to follow my dream so hard, whatever happens, I have lots of pressure and depress related to my dreams and future, that I never show to anyone, music is the only thing that supports me. I'd be very happy even if I was able to make my living out of music. Gosh, this is so hard, I just want to listen to other people's story their dreams. Achieved dreams, broken dreams, people with passion or the people who stopped following it please share it I'm very curious about every story. I want the bold truth I can stand it.
