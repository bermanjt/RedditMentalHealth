0,The police still haven't found her and I guess things don't look too good. I feel weird about it. It's not like I knew her too well but we'd spoken in the past and stuff. It's weird. I've been thinking about it a lot since I saw the news about it. Just wanted to get it off my chest I guess.,29Dec2017,1

11,"The stuff you'll read in the brackets is my comments that I write right now.

Just a quick note, the numerical order of the days may not make sense, sometimes I'd travel for weeks and I'd be too lazy to count the days, so I'd start from ""day 1"" again. Here we go!  

**Day 5: 17/12/2015**

..I learned something about imparfait and passé composé..that I know nothing!..  

*(that was interesting because I disliked French back then, now I can speak it)*

**Day 5: 4/2/2016**

..for the first time I think that my French homework is correct. I hope...  

**Day 9: 8/2/2016**

Nerves, nerves and nerves. That's all I got today. And later I got nervous because I was getting nervous.

**Day 38: 11/3/2016**

Tomorrow, chemistry competition. Am I ready? Absolutely fucking not. However it turns out, good luck. I'm not coming back without 25 points *(I actually got 25 points lel)*

**Day 48: 21/3/2016**

..In 25 days, there is a physics competition. I'll try to solve 25-30 problems per day. I need to find those 60 for the last topic, oscillations. It's the most important. *(TIFU, there was 1 problem with oscillations on the competition, and I had skipped those problems.. I did not heed my own advice, and failed to qualify for the next stage. Follow your own advice, children.)*

**Day 52: 25/3/2016**

The French exam went well, for the first time! Now I have to fix biology, learn physics, make a video about France, make a presentation for math and all will be fine.  
At least I have peanuts.

**Day 60: 2/4/2016**

My sister got 1st place in Astronomy. Gratz, sis.

**Day 61: 3/4/2016**

Damn! At 2 in the morning, I got stuck in the toilet..with no toilet paper! Shit!

**Day 70: 12/4/2016**

With each problem I am getting closer to success, but with each I also discover that my knowledge had been 0 before.

**Day 77: 19/4/2016**

*(This entry basically says that this is the day I chose Astronomy for my future career. It's true.)*

**Day 109: 22/5/2016**

..Tomorrow I plan on visiting my grandma and taking 50-100 MKD ($1-$2). With them, I will print the pulsars book. If, one day, I become an important astronomer, my grandma will have had a great part in that. *(yep, it's that cheap)*

**Day 111: 24/5/2016**

..I discovered the website Duolange or something like that *(it's Duolingo)*. VERY useful. I'll finally be able to learn French. *(This was my first serious attempt at French)*

**Day 113: 26/5/2016**

Days are becoming better and better. That is thanks to duolingo! The best website on the internet that I have so far discovered! I love it! Tôt, je vais...conquer the world! HAHAHA! MDR!*(Soon, I will...)* 
Back to reality, I have to go study for the french exam :(

**Day 120: 2/6/2016**

Today, the most unbelievable thing happened. I found 50 euros on the street. IN MACEDONIA. ON THE STREET. IN A COUNTRY THAT DOESN'T USE EUROS. WTF. HOW?!

*My first journal ends on the first of July, 2016. Then there is a two months gap, which I am pretty sure that it shouldn't exist. I can't believe I wrote nothing.*

**Day 4: 6/9/2016**

We started, with Algebra. It was awfully tiring. For that, I believe in one god. A goddess, actually. The Ancient Egyptian Goddess Seshat. Goddess of math.  
Only she can help me.  
Nothing else.

**Day 52: 24/10/2016**

The day wasn't special. I learned some physics and that's it. I was reading my diary. I was horrible. There must be change! Must!

**Day 68+1: Never 69 11/11/2016 (that's just the title of the entry, the entry is generic)**

**Day 102: Great day 14/12/2016**

Except for linear algebra. I fucked that up pretty well. I watched Rogue 1 in the evening. Better than TFA.

**Day 108: RIP Algebra 20/12/2016 (algebra, linear algebra and math were all different subjects)**

Today, I forgot the A in Algebra. It's gonna be a Byegelbra. I f'ed up real well.

**I had a trip to Germany in early 2017, so I started counting the days from 1 again.**

**Day 6: Difficult times are coming 21/2/2017**

I don't know what to write here for today, so here's a recipe for cookies:  
1l milk  
1kg flour  
1kg chocolate  
500g eggs  
1 spoon  
Mix  
Eat  
No, bake first  
Eat  
Die  

**Day 15: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 2/3/2017**

What the hell is going on?!

**Day 30: Le français 17/3/2017**

Today was the day of the french competition and I have no idea what happened. We can only wait to see. In the evening I was with the astronomical society at an ~~observation~~ freezing. *(note the french competition, and how I had problems with french just over a year before, now that's progress)*

**Day 44: Whoa 31/3/2017**

My first award at a brainy (?) competition. Third place in French. In 3 weeks we will have the national.

**Day 56: 12/4/2017**

FUCK. Duolingo - 154 day hot streak. GONE. From the start again. *(I never started again)*

**Day 68: ayy lmao 24/4/2017**

The results from the national competition in french are out! 2nd place! Just kidding, I'm 6th. Still, nice. I didn't expect that at all.

**Day 160: Cube world 25/7/2017**

I played CW with [my friend] until 5 in the morning. Don't tell him I used Cheat Engine!

**Day 170: The Great Herb War 4/8/2017**

*(I was working on the Jewish cemetery in Bitola during this time)*  
A usual day at the cemetery. Nothing special. Except..we found ammo. Unused ammo. And I, as the genius that I am (not), wanted to fire them. Thankfully, I was stopped...

**Day 174: No mustache! 8/8/2017**

Yes! Today, for the first time in 17 years, 7 months and 26 days, I have no mustache. Yay! I feel 5 years younger. *(The first time I shaved. Good day)*

**Day 220: Je ne sais pas (I don't know, in French) 23/9/2017**

Je ne sais pas. Je ne sais pas. Je ne sais pas. Je ne sais pas. Je ne sais pas. Je ne sais pas. Je ne sais pas. Je ne sais pas. *(Context: My crush had/has her eyes set on someone else, and my relations with her weren't the best.)*

**Day 238: Ouchhh 11/10/2017**

*(Context: I ate a mixture of foods, and it wasn't the best mixture...)*..I bought myself a ticket to toxicology. Thankfully, I missed the bus.

**Day 261: Night race!**

Today was the night race! I didn't win first, second or third place, but I won over the audience!

**Day 273: MAN! 15/11/2017**

Interesting! I found out that I have 87,5 points on the french B1 exam! From 100! FFS. HOW?  
  

That's about it. I had to read all this stuff for 3 hours, but it was worth it. For an example, I learned that I was basically lost and had no idea how to put my life together for one period, then it got better, but then I had an existential crisis, deep depression and shit. My entries have gotten less funny with time, but more detailed and interesting. My crush has been fucking with me for the last 5 months, apparently. She's showing signs of disinterest, and then occasionally she sends out a mixed signal and I am kept under her spell. It's also almost 4 AM and I gotta wake up soon. Fml.",29Dec2017,1

16,"I’m a 14 year old attending my freshman year of high-school, Unlike my peers I’m stressing very hard over my future, specifically what I’m going to do with it. I’m growing up in a lower earning household however my parents treat me very well often to the point of spoiling me. My dad was over 3 million dollars in debt and managed to clear in in 3 year and throughout those three years I’ve seen my dad as life and that a life I wish not to have, a life in which you put your hand in your pocket and can’t feel brittle green paper, a life where your peers succeeded and you don’t, a life of a “poor” person. Thus, my biggest fear isn’t failing but being poor if that makes sense. So that’s why I stress over stuff like this. I’ve done research and have came to the conclusion that the best opportunity for me to become “rich” is to become a physician however that’s not what my heart desires, my heart want to become a politician or lawyer of of some sort, the only problem is the varying income of these jobs. Lawyers and politicians can make 100k or 10 million dollars (I want to have a salary of minimum 500,000), I don’t want to risk the rest of my life so thus my brain is telling me to become a doctor. What should I do, follow my brain or my heart? ",29Dec2017,1

19,"I aim to be unqiue or put myself one place above other people in terms of skillsets, because I don't want to be seen as average. This is an insecurity that I have always had and I don't know why? (Perhaps it's due to my upbringing and how my mother always told me that I was good.)

This doesn't help me and distances me from other people. I put on this front of being intelligent and well off by wearing nice clothes, traveling in Business Class and so on. The reality is that I am just an average person from a lower middle class family; maybe a little more money than average but not enough to make me anywhere near rich.

When I dress up and purchase luxury items, I initially feel happy but afterwards I would be disappointed in doing this to myself again. To be honest, wearing luxury clothes does make me feel better about myself, although I do feel stuck up and aloof when I see the clothes that other people wear, in the sense that they don't seem to care about presentation and dressing well as I do.

I don't know what to do about this. I want to be content with myself, and my living standards, but if I were not to live this ""lavish"" lifestyle, I would fear that I would come across as boring and average, that no one will notice me if I don't wear luxury clothes or at least see that I exist and that i'll get ignored (or the very least that I leave a positive image). 

I want to change this trait.  Unfortunately, I do enamor luxury experiences and would nor be content with the idea of a bog standard lifestyle.. Which is the problem? What do I do with that? How do I become less defensive and open to criticism if I am obsessed with being perfect and having a luxurious life, if I am not happy living a bog standard life? 

Ultimately, I would want to be a more easy going person who is not insecure and who could handle criticism of my insecurities.

25,"(this is a throwaway)

heck how do i start? 

first off, offending people is the last thing i want in this post. i’m aware that the title may sound a bit degrading, but i feel it is the best possible way to convey what’s going on in my mind. (haha it’ll be ironic if someone gave me a better title, i’m not as smart after all xD)

i have an IQ of 136, (above average i think) i’m not here to brag, i just want to provide as many information as i can so that i can relate to someone here. i’m aware that there would be people rolling their eyes and scoffing at me, thinking “how smart can you be, you are like the rest” and i really hope what they are thinking is the case, because honestly i’m tired of people not understanding what i mean. 

i’m doing well academically, and there are peers around me who would ask me for help in school. i am absolutely willing to help as i firmly believe helping others could help you learn in some way too. even if it doesn’t help me, they are my friends, and i would like them to see what i see. the world is lonely here. 

i’m not this snobbish guy who constantly talks about how wine tastes differently when sipped from a glass in between your toes. “Oh Markassen, I could taste the vineyards of Italy, from blah blah” or...

i am in fact, very interested and fascinated with the internet culture; how we would use memes and sassy clapbacks for banter/conversation. how people constantly makes fun of millennials for this and that, when we are just having fun. 

whenever i crack jokes/have a conversation, i would try my best not to include memes and the internet culture, so that my friends would understand me better (they often don’t get internet culture/use memes reallllyyyy badly. still love them tho). i often feel like the jokes i crack are not even funny anymore. 

i really hate how i’m always supposed to explain myself when i say something that is only common sense (for me)

a bad example will be like teaching someone a math solution (because i love teaching my friends but can’t seem to remember an apt example) but they just don’t see the link clearly like i do.

idk man. i just want to find some like-minded people who can understand me and some of my obnoxiousness. like doing things ironically will not be weird because they know i’m doing it ironically. 

or maybe my friends and i has different culture altogether?  

at the end of the day, i will never think of them to be too “dumb” for me, or i exist somewhere above them. i love my friends to bits but i sometimes just want to have a decent memey/sensible/obnoxious fun. which i can’t really have right now...

maybe this title can be just renamed to “i don’t fit in”

remember that rick and morty fan base meme? basically me but acknowledging i may be an asshole altogether. ",29Dec2017,1

It may also be my fault for placing it somewhere very unconventional for myself but sometimes a guy can get distracted in the moment. It's just, why do I need to have trouble finding the thing that helps me find things. It's just like how you need money to go to school in order to make money. It's a huge loop that you can't help, but it exists for some stupid reason. Honestly I'm just rambling on right now because it's like 3:00 AM and I just need to find my glasses for tomorrow and I also need to find my WALLET which is pretty important. I guess I also should be trying to find my stuff right now or in the morning but I'm probably gonna wake up late and not meet the time that I was supposed to meet up with friends.

Remember that some people are introverts who genuinely don't feel comfortable starting a conversation even if it's with someone they're really close to. Those types of people rely on extroverts to keep the friendship alive and prevent their life from going stale.

But something interesting happened. While many of the kids understood what I was saying and chose one hand, some of the kids chose both hands. And because I didn't specify the rules of the game those kids won both gold coins and therefore double the chocolate.

What fascinates me is that children have a higher level of perception and imagination than most adults. While most adults focus on the either/or, these kids figured out there's the third option of choosing both.

A fun game turned into a psychological experiment that revealed how incredibly intuitive children can be. I look forward to working with these kids more in the coming days.",29Dec2017,1

Before I explain what just happened, here's some context.   I work as a warehouse manager for Culligan Water Treatment. I usually spend the whole day bouncing from the warehouse to my office so I don't go out to the field ever. Once in a while a service tech needs me to run a part or equipment out to them. 

Today, a service tech called me and needed a 12"" pipe wrench to finish his install, ok, no big deal since he was just 1.5 miles from the shop.  I get there and he asks me if I could give him a hand for a second. I hold the tank he's installing while he tightens a coupling (hence the need for the pipe wrench).  After that we get to talking and he mentions that it will take him a while to finish this install and asks if I would stay and lend a hand. As I said, I don't ever see how service/installs are done so I jump at the opportunity to learn more.   I'm helping him for about 2 hours, asking questions and listening to him as he explains what needs to be done and why.  I go to his truck to get some tape. When I get back to the basement of the home, he tells me the office called and is kinda pissed that I'm not back yet. Thinking there's a delivery or a customer that needs help or something that needs my attention, I try to hurry back.  When I walk into the office, one of the secretaries looks at me and says ""Here, eat pizza.""  On the table were two boxes of pizza and breadsticks.   Definitely an interesting day.

44,"I'm currently going through a bit of a hard time due to a fair few contributing factors, now I've opened up to people about a few of the things i'm not happy about, and it's interesting to get their reply and an insight into their life. So I thought to myself, with a honest breakdown and a rating, lets see how many people are truly happy in their lives, and see what aspects are holding them back.

Age, gender, location: 25, M, UK

Location: I don't like where I live. It's dull, small, quiet and for someone my age very hard to make friends and meet new people.

Home/Family Life: Very good, I still live at home and get on very well with my parents, my family is small but close. Although health worries plague my granddad, who I've gotten very close to this past year since my grandma died.

Job: Unstressful, pay is fine and the people I work with are great. The company is small and there's only about 2 others in my age bracket, both of whom have little in common with me. The job is going nowhere, and although there's talk of progression it'll never happen, its comfortable but often mundane. I feel at my age I should have achieved more in a job.

Financial: Living at home money is comfortable. I can afford to buy things for myself and a fair bit of my monthly wage goes into a savings account. I have a new car which I can afford to run and other things go out my account which don't do too much damage.

Relationships: I recently split with my gf of 4 years, i'd known her 8. She was my first love &amp; best-friend. I took this unbelievably hard. We still talk, she's all but moved on, I try to but know I haven't. I actually don't want to be with her but I still care very deeply for her.
There's no other girls in my world, I struggle to open up to anyone female, and although there's been opportunities I haven't slept with or kissed anyone since we split. She has done the opposite.
It's been 4+ months and I currently feel extremely lonely and frustrated.

Social Life: I have many people I know, but only 3 friends I would call close and only 1 I could truly open up to (he's in the same situation as me)
We mainly do the same things every weekend nights and in the daytime, I struggle to keep occupied. Being lonely, I also struggle to find any enjoyment in activities I like doing (drawing, listening to music, photography) I have a course I do after work and I go to the gym at least 4 times a week, physically i'm the best I've ever been.

Happy rating - 4/10
Overall my life is far from bad, i'm very lucky in most aspects. but the breakup and lack of female attention is bringing me down, and loneliness and boredom make me feel worse.
The rating fluctuates, but for the past 5 months it rarely goes above 5.",29Dec2017,2
47,"I’ve already taken my finals but they grades haven’t came in yet and I’m really stressed. My average is a 98% so even if I mess up a little my average goes down, and I didn’t feel too confident about them. What can I do to get my mind off it?",29Dec2017,2
48,"Stage 1: Glimpsing: This is the stage I'm currently at; I think a girl is beautiful and I like to look at her, but I don't have any romantic feelings for her.
The next stages are the actual romantic ones that I proposed. I'm looking for advice on whether they are reasonable enough to apply to enough including myself.

Stage Two: Staring: You can't get enough of this person. You are always staring at them in class and whenever you see them. However, you never have the courage to actually talk to them.

Stage Three: Flirting: You actually try to get the crush's attention by flirting or other means. They may or may not notice you.

Stage Four: The Finish Line: You and your crush have actually asked questions about your relationship. Your crush has rejected you, accepted you, or is with someone else.",29Dec2017,1
49,"I’ve come to realize that for every “good” year that I have had in life, consecutive “bad” year(s) follow after. This has been happening since 2009 from what I can remember. I’ve had way more downs than ups in my time, but hey that’s life and I’ve gotten through it. This year (2017) is hands down one of the best years I’ve had in quite some time. I actually enjoyed my time at college because I met a few people who are now close friends, earned all A’s and B’s in my classes, enjoyed my last days of summer work at my seasonal job on the boardwalk, scored an internship for next summer, and met a wonderful girl who actually likes me. And that’s just a short list. What I’m saying is I’ve had such a great and wonderful year, but realize it’s coming to an end. I don’t want 2018 to be a shitty year. Who knows how long it will be until I have another year like I did in 2017. I plan on making 2018 just as good, if not better. I just don’t know how yet. 

List of good/bad years:
2009 - good
2010 - bad
2011 - good
2012 - bad
2013 - bad
2014 - bad
2015 - good
2016 - bad
2017 - great
2018 - ????

Did I have anything major to hide? Not particularly, but I don't want someone knowing personal stories of mine and things like that. Well, new year new reddit acccount I suppose... oh well ",29Dec2017,1

Pretty damning! Imagine if Krispy Kreme had worse donuts than the stale day-old walmart ones! ",29Dec2017,2

55,"So I’m 5’6” and 120 lbs, and my bra size is a 36D. I’m pretty athletic but looking online I feel like a 36D is a pretty fat size. I’ve always had problems with my body and insecurities, and seeing this just sparked more insecurities that I’ve tried to push down in the past. ",29Dec2017,1
