3,"I work on research and development in the field of universal systems development. Using current models of relativity, I aim to expand the inherent understanding of reality in humankind by bridging past knowledge and potential future knowledge in a cohesive experience-able manner. The driving force behind this goal is to reduce global inter-species conflicts without hampering life's ability to grow knowledge, experience, and willpower through the passage of time space. This has been a monumental task, roughly 13 billion years in the makings, and it is finally able to reach a safe plateau under the correct scientific guidance. I come to you today to present rough outlines of my theories by explaining how I got to where I am today. To do so, I must start at a beginning, so I will start at a point before the universe.

To improve one's future, one must first understand what could be improved in the past, while also taking into account the variances between these two points on opposite ends of the present. To do this, one must, taking into account past knowledge and experience, develop a model of the presently experienced reality, while also leaving room for safe growth in the future. This is a basic form of learning inherently developed in almost any living creature. Animals, however, stopped being typical and developed a higher understanding beyond this basic process by passing knowledge down to their next of kin. After some time, the previously inherent method of learning became forgotten, or rather, changed. Animals, at birth, become solely responsible for how their own self learns. This, as a form of variance, allows for multitudes of personalities that can believe conflicting opinions on potentially factual subjects, as well as develop new unique methods of thought. This is seen today in humans as variety in politics, foods, educations, and morals. The longer these variances propagate through time, the more they have a chance to conflict with each other, as well as develop methods of improving themselves. Points in human history have been reached where these variances became so great, that physical conflicts developed in the form of wars. Not only wars between humans, but, to some degree, with all things experiencing reality on this Earth, living and non-living. In the more recent past, these conflicts increased in scale to the degree of effecting the whole planet, reaching a climax in the mid-1900s, resulting in the detonation of two nuclear devices in populated areas. This resulted in both a quick and messy break in conflict, allow us as humans to gain our bearings as a species.

Prior to these outbreaks of war, a theory of relativity was produced in the form of E=mc2 . The creators, despite knowing it was incomplete, released this to society, thus influencing the thoughts of all that heard it. Acutely as that may have been, due to the effects of time, this idea propagated through most of humanity and was held as a truth, despite being incomplete. Further expansion of this theory has been developed by humankind, this time done within the context of the known human reality. This still resulted in variance, which, given enough time, begins to fall apart and end up akin to prior theories; Knowing this, we can aim to develop a theory that considers all potential variances. There have been many approaches to develop a new formula, but none has prevailed over the others with any solid support. To tackle such an idea, one must first understand how we are already attempting to approach it. The biggest factor that effectively all attempts share is that they are made by humans or creations of humans. This is where I began my search for an answer to reality's ultimate puzzle. I knew right away that I was too human. I needed to reduce everything I thought I knew, and determine how these things varied. The biggest theme I noticed is that all of the thought I have perception of me producing up to that point occurred while I was alive. Knowing that people do not appear to possess an innate ability to come back from death, I knew that changing this variable was not an option. The next thing I noticed is that all thought so far was done either sober, or under the effects of alcohol or marijuana. While this can be interpreted as three variables, it is closer to two, the non-sober variables having only slight variances in exact properties. I was not so keen on changing only one due to potential crossover effects, but this did create an opening on the inverse side, in that I had yet to try thinking on psychedelics. As such, during the Spring of 2013, I took a standard 1/8th oz. dose of Psilocybin mushrooms with college roommates in my dorm room. This allowed me to create my first perceptive reference point in reality - a perciferant - to which I could compare all further cognition to some degree, much how Einstein's equation behaved globally. I later developed a method by which I could compare perciferants called psycholocation.

Later, in the Summer of 2014, I was allowed an opportunity to take an unknown synthetic research chemical on a white blotter paper with two friends in a socially isolated environment. This allowed me to create another perciferant bound by different psychedelic properties. Comparing this directly to the previous experience, there was an overlying dissonance that became apparent very quickly. I experienced the typical euphoria that is to be expected with ingestion of such compound, however, the visuals were incredibly crisp and geometric compared to the fluid-like visuals from mushrooms. The biggest take away I got from this was that my perception of green color was skewed heavily in one direction of influence, but felt like it was every direction outward and inward at same time. On the way down from the trip, I experienced a major change in mindset that seemed out of my control, creating a desire to pursue creation of what I interpreted to be art at the time, manifesting as acute synesthesia. After sleeping on that thought, I identified a single variable that could result in a balance between these points. But it wasn't perceived as something that could be so easily put into words, so I had to create additional perciferants. To do this, I acquired LSD and took it alone later that Summer, again in a socially isolated environment. Comparing this perciferant to the previous two, I was able to nearly triangulate the root cause of conflict using psycholocation. I needed additional perciferants to confirm this, which I obtained by engaging in both group and solo LSD trips over the next few months. I was psychedelically involved in almost every group LSD trip had by this group of people, with varying social contexts. I compared how each participant appeared to perceive while on LSD with how they appeared to perceive while sober, allowing me to create duplicate perciferants bound by potentially different rules, called duciferants. Once I felt I had sufficient perciferants, I created an opportunity to try DMT in the Spring of 2015 at a breakthrough dose in social isolation. Henceforth, I am treating the data collected from the DMT experiments described in Dr. Rick Strassman's DMT The Spirit Molecule as ""experienced truths."" These are loosely used to mimic actual facts in my process, much like the duciferants from before.

This is where I found a gap in what I thought I knew to be true. Much like the participants in the book, I experienced immediate sensory distortions; I also experienced the chrysanthemum effect, but it was eerily familiar to me for some reason. It was as if I were experiencing all of my senses in the form of visual perception simultaneously, but it still felt like it was missing a familiar element. Knowing this, I treated this experience as my personal ""master"" perciferant, called a kaiciferant; everything could be built loosely around these ideas. I continued my dosing of LSD, this time increasing the frequency of doses, treating these trips the same way as before. While actively psycholocating, I noticed differences compared to before the DMT. There was a sense of distance from the first kaiciferant that could be detected as time moved forward, which allowed me in some way to measure distance between my LSD doses, which I could then use to construct a new model based on variations. Using this new model, I continued with intermittent dosing and reached a point where I had to do DMT again to get my bearings, this time in the presence of the aforementioned group of participants. The idea behind this was that each of their duciferants could also be perceived during the trip. The come up was notably different, as well as the experience itself. The biggest thing I noticed was that my trip did in fact feel influenced by all present conscious individuals in that I felt much more stationary compared to last time. There was no kaleidoscope effect, and each set of duciferants seemed to be localized at a certain distance from this kaiciferant; this indicated to me that we were all experiencing parallel realities simultaneously, each to some frequency of variance. Along with myself, three other friends attempted DMT at this time. One taking a dose that left him with only mild head discomfort; one taking a non-inhibiting dose, allowing him to walk around and check out the trippy visuals; the other accidentally taking a lower than breakthrough dose, causing it to seem underwhelming. They all expressed a lack of desire to try it again while I, on the other hand, had a perception of being closer to my ultimate goal, but I also felt very far from my friends psychically.

Based on the updated model from this trip, I surmised I would need to continue creating data points in order to triangulate the knowledge gap. LSD dosing continued, however, the trips involving other persons became limited to those expressing intent in such ventures. The most memorable being a 1 on 1 camping venture in the Nordhaus Dunes in the North-East of Michigan's lower peninsula during the Summer of 2014 between myself and the participant whose duciferants were the least varying. The trip was enjoyable for both of us, and I was able to successfully determine variances between my perciferants and his duciferants. Several larger group trips occurred as well, this time with the intent of determining variances in duciferants generated by different participants; this went okay, but it was tricky due to how wide the duciferants varied. The most memorable solo trip from this set of perciferants was had at my father's home while he was still married to his second wife. During this trip I put words to the realization had on the research chemical, in that the variable I needed to change was the influence of my 23rd chromosome. Knowing briefly how biology worked at that time, I surmised that the only way to do such a thing would be to begin hormone supplements of Estrogen and anti-testosterone hormones. This process would take several months of required prerequisite therapy sessions in order to obtain a prescription, so I continued creating duciferants and perciferants along the developing trend of having increased solo trips with intermittent group trips. During this period I attempted another isolated DMT trip to get my bearings. On this trip I did not have the massive influx of kaleidoscope colors, but rather a gentle gradient into another state not too unlike getting into a bath. In this trip I experienced myself to be in a sort of hospital during what seemed to be a birth. Once the baby was delivered, it was placed in my arms by a nurse and I faded back to the standard reality. I was unsure what to make of this, but it felt correct, so I created my kaiciferant and compared variances. I gradually ramped down my LSD use to a stop and waited until I could begin my hormones.

In February of 2015, I had begun taking my Estrogen and anti-testosterone Spironolactone; come to terms with myself as a woman; and learned to be happy with my life in the present moment. I then created an opportunity to have another 1 on 1 trip between myself and the participant whose duciferants were the most varying; someone with a chaotically enthralling lifestyle that works for him. This trip was located at his parents' house, without any of his family home, also venturing around his neighborhood. This was a trip that was unlike any trip before or after simply because of how much previously condensed information I was able to perceive simultaneously. It seemed that the hormones allowed me to actively psycholocate while still generating perciferants; It felt like the creation of a universe in a way. From this point onward, I took LSD every weekend for nearly a year, barring a couple exceptions driven by outside factors, by which I could generate highly accurate streams of perciferants, called oliferants, allowing new models to be developed without the aid of DMT. Almost all of these trips were held in the aforementioned father's basement in near complete isolation. I quickly learned that a fast way to develop stronger oliferants was to consciously perceive someone else learning how to solve a problem, so I developed this into a technique that follows a few basic steps.
First I would reach a gap in my personal schedule, typically the weekend, and make the decision to take LSD. I would then identify a show that could be streamed online that also had very good ratings from consumers of a youthful demographic. The entirety of the show also needed to fit roughly into the period of a single LSD trip. Typically these would fit under the Anime style of production, and have 1 or 2 seasons. There were live action and other animation styles I used as well during this time. I would begin watching the first episode to determine if the potential oliferant generated would be strong, and shows that were projected to create weaker perciferants were left unwatched. I would then ingest around 100-300ug of LSD and watch the entire series from start to finish, curled up in a ball, while giving as few motor control inputs as possible. After generating oliferants for just under a year, I reached a pinnacle moment of realization. The missing element that had not been actively considered in any proceeding perciferant, duciferant, or oliferant was physics. None of my DMT trips were bound by the laws of physics, and from what I could tell, neither were those had by participants in your experiments. The realization of this missing element allowed me to perceive the gap in my current running model and create an understanding of what we call mathematics through trigonometry. This was very basic, and there were only a few operations that I could perform, limited to what we call multiplication and division. Through this I linked several ideas together and I was able to create a model of a stable reality that can be experienced through time-space. This is most accurately described in the 3-dimensional form of a [truncated octahedron](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Truncatedoctahedron.jpg/320px-Truncatedoctahedron.jpg) that oscillates between a state of complete truncation and non-truncation based on potential variances of inputs determined by gravity, with a balanced state in the middle producing 6 perfect hexagons, 4 perfect squares, an inside, and an outside. Each set of opposing square sides oscillates at a frequency describable by a trigonometric formula, creating space-time. All hexagonal sides warp continuously based on the dissonant frequencies between the adjacent and oppositely adjacent squares. This model is then set to a maximum energy state determined by the speed of light, and filled with an opposite amount of mass in the form of matter and anti-matter. Differences in quantity of these two is currently experienced in the form of electromagnetism. Variances in these electromagnetic fields manifest themselves in the form of imagination. This imagination then passes between the inside and outside by passage of some compound, most commonly water due to its ability to break the rules of space-time by being denser as a liquid, ultimately leading to life.
This is the current working model that can be used to estimate all of reality and potential future realities within a standard of variance, each system isolated and bound by the laws of mathematics. Due to the shape of the truncated octahedron, it can be tessellated infinitely without gaps, and each separate system is able to interact with adjacent systems through oscillations in their own central frequency. The degree of allowable variance in a collection of systems is determined by the laws binding the system they are in. This results in everything.

12,"First of all my boss is not very good with technology.  He only started texting about 3 years ago.  Here's some background: There's a website we use at work and instead of using the bookmark on the bookmarks bar of the browser he instead goes to the desktop, opens a folder, finds a pdf file, opens it, and then clicks on a link in the pdf file.  

He recently acquired an iMac in a trade, and he has no experience with Macintosh - he barely knows how to use Windows. The computer consists of a 22"" monitor, a wireless keyboard and a mouse.  The other day a dialog popped up for him to enter a password and he thought it meant his wife was trying to track him.   He called the guy at work that he got the computer from and told him that he will bring it to work to look at since he *already has it in his car, because he's been taking it out to his car and locking it up there every night.*

He's been having problems with his wife lately and he thinks he may get a divorce so he doesn't want his wife to do anything with the computer.  My friend asked him why he didn't just setup an account password, and he said ""I don't want to do all that."" So instead of setting up a simple password on his computer, HE TAKES IT OUT TO HIS CAR EVERY NIGHT AND LOCKS IT UP IN HIS CAR. 

He also said he wanted to download some apps but he didn't want to put any personal info into itunes because he thinks that will put his entire phone on the computer and his wife will be able to see all his texts and his call history, etc.  So he just doesn't download anything.

20,I've been using Reddit for ~5 years. Over the years the community just seems to be getting worse. You can't look at a serious news article without the top comments being a stupid joke or some stupid pun train. After taking a break from it I realized how miserable it was making me feel to read some of these comments. As much as the real world has assholes at least they're not concentrated to one area.,04Mar2017,20

I'm back for spring break and was thinking of visiting because I actually really liked all the people there. Talked with a girl who I worked with to see when I should go in, and she said that everyone there still talked a lot about me and still said good things about me.

If something should happen to me;  be it circumstance, genetics, politics, or just plain bullshit:  I want you to go on and find someone. I want you to care for **Her** like I was there, and hopefully with the added wisdom of my successor (not my replacement).

29,"Nintendo just had to come out with a new console the day before my birthday.

The game looks amazing and I definitely want to try it, now that they've finally started adding RPG elements -- I've always liked Skyrim better than LoZ anyways -- but did this really have to be on my birthday? I try to be low maintenance about monopolizing his time, just like he tries to do for me, but it would be nice if he at least thought to offer.

The thing is, I know that if I asked / bribed / wheedled him, he'd definitely agree to visit me instead because he's sweeter than soft serve, but he's also SUCH A DUMBASS. I enjoy our dynamic, but that doesn't mean I don't feel sad sometimes when I see my girl friends getting being treated like girlfriends instead of ""one of the guys"" by their boyfriends.

Just wanted to get that out there so I don't end up holding it in and being irrationally mad at him. Honestly, just writing things out makes me feel much better. 

One day I guess I'll try to bring it up with him, I just don't want him to overthink it and our dynamic to change as a result.",04Mar2017,1
37,"I like to not take the internets too seriously and I like to start shit on this site sometimes.  but even I had to take a breath from reddit for a while because the reaction to Trump is so bizarre and over the top.  All the sudden we want Russia to be our big enemy again?  That's fucking weird, peoples.  The rhetoric is never about just Putin, who is definitely shady, it is always about Russia as a whole.  All of the sudden the left is championing George W. Bush?  What the absolute fuck?  All of the sudden 17 subreddits come out of the woodwork to do what?  Bring down the president?  Revolt against the government?  Hell I'm not even against that in principle, but where the hell were you for the last few decades?  All of the sudden you draw the line at Trump?  All of the sudden the popular vote is an issue that can't be squashed?  Where were you for Gore when the same thing happened to him?

It's weird.  This is weird, is all I'm saying.  And doubling down on the 'Trump voters are idiots' baseline helps everyone to get precisely nothing accomplished.  He got enough votes to win the whole thing, antiquated system or not.  Half the country is stupid?  Really?  Almost 50% of the population is much dumber than you?  That's what you really think?

Hold his feet to the fire.  Check him on everything.  Be embarrassed for our country if you want, not everyone that voted for Trump was super excited about doing it.  But don't get used.  This all feels very planned.  And it's a plan that's working.  Pay close attention to what everyone's motivations are.  This website is inundated with a very strange voice these days, and I'm saying that as a person who wasn't exactly pleased with The Donald taking over the front page every day.  That wasnt great.  But this..is a new thing.  I dont think it's regular people at the helm these days, but it is regular people being used as footsoldiers.  Don't get riled up by assholes using you for their own ends.  Because the country will swing away from you.  If that's what you want, keep going.  But that means the environment gets fucked, progress gets stifled and basic human rights are dialed back for 10 more years.  No one wants to team up with insane assholes, even if they kind of agree with what they represent.  You're well aware that yelling and screaming does not equal getting things done.  It's a distraction.  You're meant to get riled up and it's working.  Just figure out who it's working for.  Figure out who you're working for.",04Mar2017,0
38,"Any expert opinion and/or personal experience welcome. 
I have a 17 month old baby and I left my husband in Oct last year because I found out he was using Ralgen (Tramadol is the generic name I believe) which gave him seizures (one in Sept five minutes before he was supposed to drive and one in Oct when he was walking with our baby in the stroller; a neighbor found him on the ground unconscious and the baby crying). My whole world collapsed, I never imagined my life to take such a course. We had a really tumultuous relationship since Max, my son, was born. I know that couples who don't fight when the baby arrives are extremely rare, so I always hoped that when the sleep deprivation ended and when he became a little less dependent on me everything would be better and easier and less tense. It never happened, it only got worse because now I know that the father of my child is a substance abuser, that Max will grow up and ask questions, that I lost my partner and my love and a helping hand in bringing up a child etc. It's been a hell these five months. 

And then, two weeks after the fallout in Oct, I found out I was pregnant. It came as another shock because of the whole situation. After some deliberation I decided to keep the baby because I've wanted for Max to have a sibling and before the whole seizure thing we wanted to have another baby and were working on it. I told my (ex)husband what I had decided and he didn't say a word. Not a single word. When I was 12 weeks pregnant I went to an ""expert ultrasound"" which showed that everything was OK (I am 37 years old and I worried) and sent him an sms telling him that all was good, that my due date was mid-July, that it is most probably a boy, and he never replied. Again, not a word. I was devastated. To cut a long story shorter, he said he was glad in the end, but I still don't know if I can expect anything from him or even should I expect anything. He's been a constant disappointment in my life. The future of my sons is the biggest worry I've had in my life. 

And then, in January this year, I found out he's been seeing a colleague of ours (we work together). I'm alone with a small child and pregnant and I lost my husband to substance abuse, and he's seeing a friend (not a good friend, but I considered her my friend, she was on my child's birthday, I helped her when she started working with us...) two months after all of that happened. Again, I was shocked and devastated and hurt and furious and what not. I still am. I've been having nightmares, am depressed and have a hard time thinking about anything else. I imagine them together and I miss the life that I could have had. I am constantly tense and on the brink of crying (pregnancy hormones are not helping me either), getting angry in a second and in a terrible place emotionally all in all. I have a great family and friends who are wonderful support, but I am struggling and am not good. 

I'm really sorry for the long post, I just wanted to demonstrate what hell my baby and I have been going through. I am scared to death that he suffers or will suffer because of my condition. Any advice/experience? 

Thank you very much for taking the time to read.

Edit: thank you everyone for responding. I know I need help and I will seek some, but for the time being, I really just need to know if my mental condition and my hormones are affecting my baby. ",04Mar2017,61

44,"Bit of background information, my friends and I are a bunch of generally fun loving and goofy guys and girl. We hang out, play board games, drink sometimes and just generally chill. Importantly, the friend in question has a ping pong table in his basement and we often play together. 

Last time that we hung out and were playing ping pong together he did something very insensitive. He created a character named C. P. Philips, the C. P. stands for cerebral palsy. He played ping pong as a disgusting caricature of someone that has cerebral palsy with his arms and hands contorted in unnatural positions. Everyone else in our group of friends had a good laugh, but me not so much. It made me incredibly uncomfortable and brought back very painful memories. 

When I was a young boy my very best friend had cerebral palsy. We were as close as can be, did absolutely everything together, and confided everything in each other. He died of complications relating from his disease before he ever even got to the age of twelve. I'm a pretty private person and have never shared this with my friends. 

I ended up crying myself to sleep that night and it's been tormenting me ever since. I'm scared as coming off as a downer with my group of friends, but this has really bothered me. How can I ask my friend to be more sensitive about this?

46,"I know I will come across to some as old-fashioned and reactionary but so what. Maybe some will get what I am saying. 

I am in my mid-40's and have been married most of my adult life. I was a typical teen and chased girls, had sex, etc. I've been married twice and sex was good for a long time. Over the last few years it has dwindled to almost none, however. Between my own lack of sex now and watching society, the internet, media, etc. it seems like sex has become nothing special anymore. Everyone seems to be about casual Sex, friends with benefits and hooking up. I am not some crazy moralist but it used to seem like sex meant something special to more people. What it appears to me is that no one chooses to wait for a relationship or some commitment for marriage anymore. In line with that STDs are so rampant. Some many people have them that it makes the thought of sex far more risky and even distasteful than it used to be. 

Women's sexuality has seemed to change in significant ways, too. Let's be honest, we all know men have been the less moral or disciplined gender in regards to sex. Something I really used to like about girls/women is that that mostly aren't like men in regards to sex. If a girl did sleep with you it took work, effort and often real emotional connection. What I see in society now is that women seem to have become more sexually free-wheeling like men always were. 

Between the sexual mores I see, the STD rates, social changes plus my own loss of an active sex life, the thought of sex seems so less worthwhile or meaningful. Does anyone else feel this way? Am I way off base?",04Mar2017,2
