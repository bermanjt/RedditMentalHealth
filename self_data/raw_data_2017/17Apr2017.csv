1,"She's not dead by any means. Still alive. Just wants absolutely nothing to do with me. 

We became friends quickly. The first week we met she said she wanted to get married to a good catholic dude and have 7 children. A year later she came out to me as bisexual in tears. A year after that she drunkenly said I was her soulmate and the love of her life for the first time. A year after that things had gotten so blurry and confusing between us that I had to ask ""What are we?"" She was taken aback by the question. Sobbed a lot. Said she was confused about herself and about her feelings for me. I still wanted to be friends and support her through it. She said I was her best friend and she couldn't lose me. But then as I tried to repair the bridge between us, she kept lighting matches to keep on burning it.

 Eventually after almost a year of me trying to be there for her, trying to be her friend, trying to keep things somewhat normal, I gave up. I felt more alone than I ever had. I felt so out of control during the whole situation. I HAD to say something, I felt I had no choice. She wanted us to move in together, to share a room and a bed together but would still go out on dates that her mom set her up with. She would tell strangers we were dating and the accurate story of how we met and then ignore my texts for 3 days. She would tell me that I saved her life and that she had never felt so close to me before but then be unsupportive towards any dream I had that didn't directly involve her. 

When I realized it was finally over I also realized I didn't know who I was without her. I gathered up a lot of my savings and I ran off to Europe for 6 weeks. It taught me to be okay with being alone, perhaps maybe too okay. I met strangers from all over the place and I keep in touch with a variety of people from different marks all over the map. I have a friend in every continent. I came back and officially quit the job we had worked at together. It wasn't a real shock to anyone. I found something better and I'm glad I made the decision I did there. 

I haven't spoken a word to her since September. We last saw each other on Halloween. In February she deleted me and all of my family and any friends of mine she had met off of facebook. I noticed it and blocked her. Some days are okay and I don't miss her. Some days the rose colored glasses come off and I realize that our friendship had been convoluted and unhealthy for a long time. Most days I miss her though. I miss having someone who understood me, even the worst parts of me. I wonder if I'll meet someone like that again. I wonder if I'll ever stop missing her. Our mutual friends greet me with a look of pity/sorrow and make statements like ""How could she do that to you?"" or ""You know this isn't your fault right? She has her own battles to fight.""  or ""She's not doing so well...can you try reaching out to her again? You and her were so close."" I tried reaching out for so long. I can't do it anymore. I just want to forget her. ",17Apr2017,2
2,"As the experimented reporter that she is, Emily knows how to find the best spots for incredible and breathtaking reports. Her grandfather once told her the story of a paranormal phenomenon that scared him and his friends during a cold winter night. When he was younger, his wife took a flight, but unfortunately, she never reached her destination.
 A year later, when he heard about a bizarre apparition that happened in the woods nearby of a small plane, he immediately did the connection between the two events. He had to see this by himself. What he saw there scared him for life. Ignoring her relative’s advice begging her not to go, Emily decides that it would make a perfect subject for her upcoming report. She soon begins to feel an odd ambiance as she tries to collect information about the crash. Something is definitely fishy. Seeing and hearing things she never thought she would, she learns fast enough about the mystery surrounding the plane’s crew and passengers. However, nothing will prevent Emily from going as far as she can in her personal investigation of this never-to-be-forgotten accident that happened half a century ago. Those close to her start thinking she is obsessed with that quest. The chills that she feels when approaching the wreckage, deep in the forest, are part of the reasons why she absolutely needs to reach the next step of her case. One thing is sure; she was not ready for what was lurking in those woods, fifty years after the tragic events. Stay Away is a suspenseful, dark and disturbing movie that allows viewers to easily slide into Emily’s shoes and live her thrills alongside her.

#One more time for the idiots: NO I DO NOT CONDONE HIS ACTIONS

He is a byproduct of people being fucking assholes for no reason, like all the pieces of shit in these comments. ""man up"" how about you man tf and act like a man and be respectful? Women too. The fuck is wrong with y'all? The people who hurt him are to blame just as much. If you can't accept that, then you aren't even worthy of being considered human, let alone intelligent.

Yes he needs to be stopped but the people who did this to him are just as much to blame.

**No I do not condone his actions.**

It's easy to tell another person to ""get over it"" when it's not your battle, not your life, and when you're not them. Mental illness is real, go walk a mile in someones shoes with one. Not everyone is capable of being as strong as you are. Believing that is a naive childs dream, time to grow and face the facts and reality. Stop living in your perfect little deluded world where everybody is strong and everybody should be able to handle everything thats thrown at them easily. That's bullshit. Complete utter bullshit. I'm disgusted with the human race. You call yourselves humans? Disgraceful. You aren't worthy of being considered human.

**No I do not condone his actions.**

I guess it's cool to be a dick to somebody for no reason and treat them like shit, then expect them to get over it like nothing happened.

**Everybody loves to jump to conclusions and find the quickest solution even if it's the wrong one or not a solution at all. ""Do not judge, lest ye be judged."" The lack of understanding, even on smaller issues, is sickening.**

And what's amazing, is somebody will still think that I think what this guy isn't doing is okay. Even after saying 4 times it's not.

17,"Hey guys, right now I'm thinking that I will be joining Franklin &amp; Marshall College's class of 2021! According to US News and Princeton Review and the like, some other schools I got into, for example, Brandeis, Lafayette, and Northeastern, are more presitigous, but I've gotten to the point where I can say fuck rankings. I'm very lucky that cost isn't an issue, and my major is undecided, but I'd likely study Politics or Business. None of that is holding me back from F&amp;M. But this is. 

God, I feel so shitty for saying this, but it's my best friend, aka my twin sister. She got into F&amp;M too, and I know it's been one of her tops for awhile. Coming from a small town and a small school, we did most of the same activities and thus have most of the same friends. In college, there's no doubt that we'd be studying completely different things, and we've already talked about the fact that we'd NEVER room together after 17 years of sharing a room. We would even request to live in different dorms. I'm more outgoing with strangers, and she's more outgoing with people she knows, so I'm afraid that she'd rely on me to make friends freshman year. I don't want to be thought of as a package anymore. 

I'm prone to major anxiety, so while having her at school to continue supporting me would be a huge plus, this decision is causing me some major anxiety itself. So do I attend Brandeis or NEU because she didn't get in? Do I commit to F&amp;M, or wait for her to make her decision first? 

We're fraternal but both girls, and I'm fucking sick and tired of being twin lumped - being considered half of one person rather than an individual. People this weird fascination with twins, like we have superpowers or something.

I'm afraid that going to F&amp;M together would be doing exactly what everyone expects us to do. Yet, I think that I need to make this decision based not off of her, but based off of me which school is the best fit. Is that so wrong? 

My parents are pretty much the only people that think we should go to school together. Everyone knows how frustrated we are by the twin lumping, and my friends have a point by saying that going to different schools would completely avoid that issue continuing in college. My parents say that we just would need to actively work to have ""separate experiences together"", but I fear the judgement from everyone else around me. 

Any twins in the same boat? Can anyone give me some advice here, or tips for going to school with a sibling? I'm so anxious about all of this. Thank you. ",17Apr2017,1

19,"I far too easily attribute anything negative in my life to the fact that I was a stoner. Its easy to use weed as a scapegoat. My perceived problems are still here now that I've quit, only now I'm forced to deal with them in the cold light of day. I find all of reality like this now, that little bit more visceral. The boredom arrives much easier, my temper is that bit quicker. These are things that I know I want to tackle sober to really improve rather than get high and paper over the cracks. but its tough, I'm depressed half the time because I'm accustomed to the quick fix. I remind myself that I want to have a free mind, and be my most inspired, creative, and useful self.


The positives start to become more visceral too. I can hold conversation, and eye contact, and almost a train of thought. I could not have kept my shit together to write this two weeks ago. I would be wrapped up down a warm rabbit hole, telling myself I was being productive. I would be making excuses and apologising for my attitude, rewarding every small milestone of work with a joint, not phoning the bank, not brushing my teeth. And if you think i’m scapegoating again.. I might be! Making excuses and being lazy may well be inherent traits of mine, separate from the influence of weed. But If I’m going to work on them, I’m only going to do it sober. 


I know that If i’m going to make progress towards my goals I need to be serious, lucid, and sober. But I feel the pull, the pleasant blanket.. where the music was beautiful, the podcasts were infinitely interesting, my appetite was insatiable, and there was no world outside. Well, that was of a time, and now is now. Those states of mind might well still be available through getting high (This is what we love about the herb) but Its not how I now want to try and access them.


At the moment I need to constantly remind myself why I’ve quit and why I’m doing this because its a serious pull. Its behavioural, and chemical, and its strong. Its been at least 8 years since I last made decisions and had thoughts about the future that didn’t involve me getting high. And although I know nothing about neurobiology I do instinctively know that I have a re-building task on my hands. The rewards of which could take as long as the habit took. I want to be truly open to experience, rather than try to manufacture it to suit myself. Hourly reminders on my phone tell me to focus on my breath and just accept the present moment, and again, return to the breath.


Weeds a strange one, history and society almost tells us that its harmless, people have always gotten high, Its the most widespread drug, Its just a plant that makes you happy.. right? Its been easy for me in the past to fall back on any variety of this line of thinking to tell myself that I don’t have a problem and just carry on as normal. Oddly, It always felt empowering to fall back into usage after such a reasoning. My thinking now is that whether weed is harmless or not, my attitude towards it hasn’t been harmless. Thats a personal thing. Its not about weed, it’s about my mind, and I want to build a strong one.",17Apr2017,1
22,"If you'd like to write to any of your representatives (in the UK), please use this website: [writetothem.com](https://www.writetothem.com/)

I have redacted some of the letter due to the nature of the letter's content.

~

Dear *Name Redacted*,

I hope you are well and enjoying your new role as MP for *Redacted*. I appreciate enormously your response to my letter concerning homelessness. (*Redacted*). I do hope we can find a great deal of common ground to work upon.

Revisiting your maiden speech in Parliament made me, again, very proud of the work done in that house over the course of our Island's history.

Your letter to the *Redacted* following the barbaric cowardice we all witnessed on 22 March 2017 was a necessary response.

I'd like to raise an extremely sensitive issue with you today. To be completely specific, I would like to criticize the theism of Islam. I truly understand the sensitivity of many upon hearing a statement such as this. I must say that I do not wish to criticize a single Muslim, or person with religious faith. I recently had a conversation with Town Councillor *Redacted*, which has inspired me to write this letter.

I believe, and do not hesitate to correct me if I am wrong, that the central tenements of the books of the Hadith and the Holy Quran are at fault where other religious scripts are not. I mean to say, Islam is inheritantly harder to reform than, say Christianity or the church of the Jehovah's Witnesses, here in *Redacted*. It has been suggested that Islam is a special case.

The nuance of our great modern English language allow for grave mistakes to be made. Jihad is not Jihadism; Islam is not Islamism; religion is not religionism and not all muslims are Islamic. With this in mind, can you tell me what you believe to be the single critical factor in the decision in a young man's brain, for him (and it is almost always a male) to decide that killing women and children and other men in the desert would be a better use of his time than to stay at his home on this bright Isle, and live?

I am aware that your predecessor made strides towards the shared global future of religious indifference that is right. Please see the authors Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Maajid Nawaz for more detail.

I hold no religion dear; I do hold the rights of any man to be true though; so could you please raise this issue, delicately, of extreme nuance in language of religion, within the thin bounds of our House of Commons.

I appreciate completely the time you've taken to read this letter, and it was good to see you here in *Redacted* in March, on a community spring clean litter-pick.

I look forward to your response.

Yours sincerely,

*Name Redacted*

I remember when we received awards for graduation, a whole bunch of students' names would be called out. Each time there was a lot of applause. For the most popular students, there'd be an uproar in the auditorium with friends/family shouting their names or some inside joke.

When my name was called towards the end, no one clapped. Of course, there were pity claps after about 2 long seconds of silence.

I have 1 goldfish and had 3 minnows. They're all ""feeder fish"" but I enjoy them and I've been taking care of them since January or early February.


I always feed them first thing when I get out of bed. I walked over to the tank and saw my biggest minnow lying on the bottom in the corner. It's not the first time I have removed a dead fish but I got a sick feeling in the stomach. Fish are supposed to swim and move their gills. Seeing one lifelessly laying on the gravel is disturbing.


I got rid of it and went back to look at my other fish. I noticed the two other minnows don't look good either. Both are struggling to swim right now. They have this weird white powder looking stuff on their fins, almost like they're rotting. I don't think they'll make it.

51,"A year ago I was working with a support rep from one of our network vendors. We scheduled a remote session for them to troubleshoot yet another serious bug with their firmware and enterprise management software. I was having to monitor their activity as they SSH'd into our equipment while continuing on with my work.

I noticed at one point that the rep was enabling some additional CLI options in the environment variables (changing some boot arguments). Though they had done this in previous sessions, they were entering an additional command to ""open a door."" A challenge phrase would appear and, once successfully answered, the CLI would turn into a Linux shell. This gave them access to the underlying Linux system **as root**.

I guess the rep began to just copy-paste the commands into the shell a little while into our session — probably due to how tedious it was. At one point they didn't get into the right configuration level, causing the security phrase to be exposed as some commands failed to execute.

Are you ready for it?

The password is:

# `pazzword`

Yup. That's it.

Did I also mention that this works for both their network equipment _and_ enterprise management server software?

_____

## So what?

### First and foremost, that's really terrible security

That password is really easy to brute-force/guess. Who in the hell approved that?!

The password is, of course, hard-coded into the firmware and it's not obfuscated. While servicing one of our units, I pulled out the USB and cloned it. I got curious and disassembled one of the files. Sure enough, [the command is visible](http://imgur.com/R3SNt17) and the [""pazzword"" can be found in the strings](http://imgur.com/hvFFFrs).

### Second, it gives you **root** access to the underlying system

BusyBox commands and . . . oh, `/usr/etc/sshd_config`! We can enable passwordless login as root (which works) or increase the verbosity to see key exchanges. Use your imagination. 

### Third, this can be setup and accessed within the AOS

This isn't some zero-day exploit, I know. You'd have to have access to the equipment for this to make much of a difference. For an employee with access, it doesn't require taking the unit offline. Also, there is at least one exploit from other parts of the AOS that can give you `config` privileges which haven't been patched over the years. I'd be wary of using cloud management too . . .

#### Why is it an issue, you may ask?

1. If the boot argument is set, _any account that can enter global configuration mode_ can open this door
2. If the boot argument is not set, anyone with access to the `boot-env` command can set it and then open this door
3. If the boot argument is not set and the user can't edit the `boot-env`, but they have access to the bootloader and global configuration mode, they can modify the `bootargs` value there and save it. You'll notice a device rebooting in the logs or going offline in your monitoring system for a short period, but if you have some spare units tucked away . . . 

1 &amp; 2 do not require rebooting the device. Unless you actively monitor command authentication, you won't notice much. Commands entered in the Linux shell aren't logged (obviously). The second one requires read-write privileges, so you'll see the boot environment being saved.

### How can you access the door?

It's simple! You need `CLIOPTS=b` in the `bootargs` variable

#### To set the `bootargs`:

    # config
    (config)# boot-env
    (config-env)# edit bootargs console=ttyS0,115200n8 root 	=/dev/ram rw quiet CLIOPTS=b
    (config-env)# save ! we *must* save within the boot-env as it's separate from the system config!

#### To finally access it:

    # config
    (config)# o

A challenge then pops up:

`Opendoor?`

Enter in `pazzword` and you're good to go.
