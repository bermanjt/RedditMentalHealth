7,"Hello,

Sorry if I'm doing this wrong. It's my first post. 

I'm at home following my graduation from college. My younger brother and I just came back from a dinner with my parents. We've never been ""rich"" by any means, but not poor either. 

This time at home I just feel like something is up with my parents and their finances. I had to pay for mine and my brother's meal at dinner, which was 30$. It's not something I mind doing, it just worries me. I'm leaving the country on Sunday and I feel guilty saying that I'm happy to be going kinda far away. Then I don't have to worry so much about it. I have another family member that helps me out with my finances. This way, I can just be fine and not worry about things being tight while focusing on my studies. 

I love my parents. But I don't want to take care of them when I'm only 22.... I can't help that they weren't financially responsible at some points in their life, that my dad has no retirement, or that he decided not to take a stable job. I love them to death but I'm just kinda bitter (for lack of a better word?) about the situation, I guess... 

It also just sucks because I've read so many ways to downsize and they don't do a lot of things to do that. They don't need a three bedroom house with just them, but they insist on having one. They bought my brother a car when he didn't absolutely need one. I've told them to sell my car when I leave, but that's more because I'm trying to distance myself financially. 

I have this year to do my master and then I'll just try to get a job where I can get paid well and make good financial decisions.

So, May 9th 2017 I walked into Walmart a new hire. I was sweet talked into doing ""Maintenance"" which is a fancy way of saying Janitorial services. They told me ""You won't be on maintenance very long."" never told me anything else about it, or how horrible it would be.

 


Let me start off by saying how bad the customer's treated me. Per Walmart policy to clean a bathroom if it needs to be sanitized or mopped I need to close the bathroom down and deny entry to anyone because of wet floors, blood or whatever and chemicals. The only interaction I had with customers was them being angry with me. I got called names on a daily basis because I had to close bathrooms down. One man stood by the Women's bathroom as I cleaned it and stared at me every time I went to my cart to grab something and then allowed his child to urinate all over the floor right in front of me. Then he blamed me as his child screamed. I was constantly being exposed to used needles, blood, urine and feces. People treat ""Broom pushers"" with a huge lack of respect. Many don't but many do. It can wear on you... big time.

 


When I was first hired, they told me it was a Part-time position, that all maintenance positions were. Two weeks after I was hired I found out that the other two maintenance on with me were both full time. That is lie number 1.

 


I was trained by a lady that had been working off and on at that Walmart for years. She will move back and forth between here and another state and get re-hired over and over again. Her idea of training me was to cut every corner possible. She would use the same rag she cleaned the toilets off with on the counters. She would never change gloves, mop floors, or dust anything. We clashed almost instantly because I wanted to do everything right. She also would speak over me and never let me talk. She would constantly tell me ""There isn't enough time.""... As soon as I got a routine down, I would get an entire bathroom cleaned in 20 minutes, policy was we could take 30 minutes to clean one bathroom. I would also disinfect if I feel it needed it, she wouldn't' do this.

 


So in the first couple of weeks, we started with 4 maintenance. One went on to Over night, one hard-ship transferred out of the store about 2 weeks after I was hired and another has severe Autism and doesn't do anything but sweep the parking lot. HOW he has a job is beyond me. He's been working there for 10 years and isn't able to perform his duties. He refuses to clean bathrooms or take out trash inside of the store, he will get distracted by small things like sweeping areas that don't need it for hours.. He's also full time. He goes unnoticed because he doesn't talk to anyone, ever.

 


A week after I started working here, I developed bronchitis. A month or so goes by, I decided to go to the doctor and was given a diagnosis. I ended up having to take two days off. I knew nothing about the LOA policy or what I had to do so I ended up with 2 occurrences. I was placed on antibiotics and a inhaler. I went to my Manager and explained how I was sick and the chemicals or the dust was causing my breathing problems. I had my doctor's notes in hand. I asked to be transferred out of maintenance. This vile woman couldn't even say no to my face. She had a Customer service manger tell me ""You applied for maintenance, that is the job you're going to do. If you can't perform your job you can quit. Those are your only options."".. I felt really hurt.

 


So here I am, about a month or more on now scheduled ALONE with the Autistic (that refuses to clean the store) guy to clean a 30,000+ SQF store by myself. That's 5 full sized bathrooms, one bathroom is a family restroom, empty out about 45+ trash cans, clean the break room and empty out trash there, mop the floors, sweep, clean windows. Most of these are required that I check on and change or clean every HOUR. I also had to lift upward of 400 or more lbs worth of trash because instead of putting trash in the compactor they would stack it up in the back into this huge mountain of trash. I worked alone in the store for over a month. The entire time not one customer complained about bathrooms or trash or anything. I worked non-stop from the moment I clocked in until I left.

 


Co-workers would drop their trash off in the bins in the maintenance area instead of taking care of it themselves. I would get stopped in the middle of doing things constantly or called over the PA system to come clean this department or that spill or this mess. I was called to the front bathrooms once to flush a toilet. They refuse to give me copies of the proper keys so I would be expected to sign out ONE key that I needed to work with every day and only a manager could get it for me. I would end up waiting 30 or more minutes for them. They also had to come and open the trash compactor which half the time I was back there waiting 30-45 minutes for them to come. All of my hourly duties would get behind and I would have to bust my ass to catch up. I got absolutely no respect for being the only maintenance on. I would have to beg people to let me rest, or that I couldn't help them because of XYZ and I'm visibly exhausted and drenched in sweat. I lost 28lbs in 2 and a half months after I got this job.

 


So this went on for over a month before I got help. A 76 year old man was hired on to help me. He worked very hard for about a week, then dropped off and started taking advantage of me. He told me ""I'm just going to stay out of your way."" making me do everything. It would be another 2 or more weeks before someone else was hired. This guy had two days on, and a week off. Also. Every single new hire we had I was expected to train them.

 


Being the only day time maintenance and there being 4 over night. We managed to bring the clean rating of my store from a 88.1% to a 96% in less than 2 months. It had been in the 80s for over a year until I was hired. I am not kidding when I say I busted my ass every day. Then I started noticing something.

 


After the 76 year old was hired, my hours went from a steady 32 a week, to 26.. Then after another guy was hired, they dropped down to 20 a week... and another was hired about 2 weeks ago, I checked my hours they were at 12 a week! I felt completely taken advantage of. I did nothing wrong, I was never late. I did complain a lot but the work environment we had was hard. My HR manager knew this but the store manager didn't give two fucks about me or how hard I worked. 

 


So. I decided I had had enough. Last Saturday I clocked in and saw the 76 year old was there. The store was a complete disaster from the O/N crew. I needed him to help me. He decides he's going to open a box of tools that's been sitting in the maintenance area for over a year untouched and organize it. He would ask me what he needed to do and I would tell him and he'd never do it. So I took off my vest, placed them on my HR managers desk and left. 

 


Yesterday I got a call from my HR manager saying she didn't want to lose me and she would help me get into another department. Why I needed to take this to an extreme after repeatedly asking for help to get transferred out is beyond me. She was suppose to call me today but she didn't. So I decided to drive down there. She had been called to another store and was helping them so I got directed to talk to our ""Temporary Store manager"" she is a complete and total bitch. She hates being there, she hates that she got called in to work at our store. She has never said Hello to me in the 3 months I've worked there. She won't give me things to do directly she will tell someone else to tell me. The ONE time she's talked to me she rudely asked me if I had done what she had asked someone to tell me to do.

 

I got about 10 feet away from her when she asked me what I wanted. I wanted to speak to her in private about it but wouldn't budge. So I briefly tell her why I was there and I wanted to talk to my HR manager when she tells me ""You have 4 occurrences . You terminated yourself, there is nothing to discuss."" and she started to walk away from me. I had to speak loudly to tell her that I had an open case with the LOA people and my occurrences would be taken care of. She told me I was wrong but ""Whatever, she'd give me an answer tomorrow."" I said thank you and left the store almost in tears.

 


I immediately called my market manager and my regional manager. I worked too hard, came home sore for too long and refused my daughter play dates because I was exhausted to many times, to just be tossed aside like some garbage. This lady is not going to win. So the regional manager told me what I need to do to get my marks taken off and told me she would handle my store manager. We'll see what happens, if I get fired or not.

 


If you made it this far, that was a roller coaster of my life.. but I NEED this job and I'm sick of being treated like crap by ""Salaried members of management."" this is why we need a union but Walmart refuses.

14,"I'm 21 male. Living in Turkey. I've got no debt, no family tragedy or whatsoever. I'm taking CS education which is my childhood dream. My family is not rich, also we're not poor. I've been in Scandinavia recently which it was an another childhood dream for me to see Norway, Denmark and Sweden. 


Okay, I have to admit that my life is not perfect. I've anxiety disorder and OCD but are they capable of ruining my entire life ? Everyday I wake up and sit on a computer. I want to do something. Anything. For example I say to myself that, I'm gonna learn x programming language or I'm gonna study maths. But no. Also I don't do anything. I don't want to watch movies, I don't want to surf on the internet, I don't want to play games... I would've go out but it's really hot over here (like +50C/+122F). I don't have many friends and can't find new ones*. 


Maybe I feel alone and I just need a girlfriend ? This topic also has a complex background on me. I maybe the unluckiest person around me about relationships. I was so naive when I was in high school. I thought I'm looking for a love of my life which I'll marry one day and in that time my brain told me to be loyal whatever happens. Fell in love with a girl on sophomore year of high school. Got rejected. I was devastated and heart broken. Maybe because of OCD, I don't know, I just couldn't get rid of her. I wasted my entire high school years just thinking about her. How can get rejected ? ""My love was pure"" that's what I thought back then. Arrogant nice guy shit... I didn't look for anyone else that time. Huge mistake. Now I've got no experience as boyfriend. I don't know how to be one. I want to put some distance with people, just to avoid to be labeled as weirdo due to lack of experience. I probably overthink about it. Sometimes I deny that having or not having a girlfriend does not matter. I just need a casual friend network but sometimes I feel -Sounds maybe greedy but- I want more love and maybe some attention than any friend can give me. Maybe I just need sex. It's been almost 3 years since last time -it was also my first- I had sex. I don't know. I do not know how to proceed in such matters. As I say, I probably overthink but society I'm living in is not really open to such things due to being highly conservative. There are lots of liberals, and such but still I'm unlucky to find them, interact with them. I don't consider myself ugly or have low self confidence. I just feel unlucky. Born in the wrong fuckin' country, being in a society which thinks way more different than me... 



I want to get away, to a place where I don't have to deal with people's political arguments, discrimination. I want to have at least some intellectual conversations, talk about movies, maybe play board games with friends, be drunk and sleep on streets, go for camping/hiking, have some coffee with a girl. I don't know. I want to do everything I miss in life until death comes to my door. Instead of doing this things that I wanted to, I am dealing with fucking Islamofacist dictator and his ISIS lover child fucker pedophile pervert voters, university teachers who don't know shit which sends you to summer school in order to take more money per student for buying a new car every year, attention-whores who sees you as free beer or drink, so called friends which sends message only when they need something from you... When I'll live as a normal human being ? So sorry for writing too much. I had no one to talk this matters. I actually don't looking for an advice or something, just waiting for graduate from university and go to Europe/North America ASAP just like my cousins did. This things are not like major problems like kicked out from house, having a $200k debt, having a cancer, or lost someone who is close to you but my brain does not stop thinking about them. Thanks to everyone who made effort to read this, I appreciate a lot.



* :   *After graduating from high school I went to Greece for study purposes but had to come back due to economic crisis. When I came back home all of my friends went to another cities for university. Time separated us. If I see any of them on summertime conversation doesn't go more than ""Hi, How are you?"". Since I came back, I started to a University in small city but people over there... I don't know how exactly to describe but, 98% of them piece of shit. It's kinda political but almost everyone is highly ultra-conservative and politically active. All they talk is how proud they're believe in religion, roads that build by government, how they wanna kill someone who is not one of them... This is the religious group and there is another group of people which they're ultra-nationalist. Which is not really my thing, not at all. I've no idea of their mentality. So I prefer to stay away. My hometown is huge (3 million people lives here) but I used to makes friends from school, or place I go regularly but now I've got no place to go like school and such. This makes really hard for me to find someone to have conversation with.* ",03Aug2017,2

19,"I have came to realize that anxiety had become a good fraction of my life in many different ways. My mother suffers from anxiety and she is finally in a place in her life where she has the help she needs to calm it and she is confident. 

I do believe in conventional medicine as much as homeopathic medicine. My midwives have provided me with some tinctures while I was pregnant and also for my postpartum care. 

I currently have a stress tincture by Silver Sage Herbs that I find has worked so great, but for some crazy reason I don't actually get crazy long term anxiety but more random short anxiety, so the tincture I keep on me at all times are for big emergencies. But what do I do for my short anxiety attacks? Is it bad enough to seek conventional medicines like valium? Can I function and take care of my child while I trail different types of medications for my small attacks? Which will include side effects and mood changes. Is that even worth it? Or do I seek meditation or yoga? Or do I just use the tincture and make it a habit to purchase regularly, which can be spendy? 

My most important question I ask my myself as a single mother with my hands completely full with my 10 month old is, can I even get a 15-30 min break to actually relax or am I doomed at this point in time and it will always consist of cleaning and napping? Which doesn't help the anxiety. In fact I'm doing what needs to done and hoping that the house stays clean while praying I get enough rest to allow my self that time. 

Who am I kidding, my house is usually somewhat decent and a good percentage of mothers don't get sleep. I don't know if trying to keep it clean half the time is even worth it anymore and I might be able to sleep, until my child shoves her toe up my nose while sleeping. 

Before I had my daughter, I had never been around a child from day 1 (newborn) this much before and it's defiantly a brand new experience. I never even imagined how crazy infants can get at just 8-10 months, and clearly wasn't informed well enough. These hard times are only teaching me a new lesson every day and I'm grateful for every lesson learned so far and every lesson to come. 

She's the best and is just super active. How do parents with twins/multiple children handle the wild times cause sometimes my anxiety attacks will just happen over the the smallest things (like finding something to put in her mouth even tho I have already vacuumed like 3 times that day). I can't keep up with her, and I mean she's fast.... turbo baby! 

I love my single mom life and I need to take action and get my anxiety under control. I just never thought anxiety could be so uncontrollable and overtaking. Proven fact that anxiety disorders are the most common and pervasive mental disorders in the United States and knowing this fact means I should be able to seek the help I need to control this disorder. But I will also keep in mind as I will try to share with my friends and family that occasional anxiety is a completely normal part of life. I am not alone on this journey and need to do what I can to seek more ways to help ease my anxiety attacks until I have semi mastered them. I hope. 

I am doing this not just for me but for my daughter. She's is my world and I will continue to do my best to keep her postive, radiant and happy, because that is what she deserves. In that case I have to continue to be happy and positive for her.
I will figure this out someday, and I have to thank my family and most importantly my little sister for helping me realize all of this and being there to help me when I needed it the most. Now I am on my way to seek what will work best for mine and my child's lifestyle. Wish me luck!",03Aug2017,1

Only serious thing my life revolved around was degree and getting a good job. I was lazy and didnt put too much effort in and in all the spare time I had, i didnt hang about with friends or o drinking or any of that fun shit. Just sat home and did jackshit for 4 years. graduated and life became all about getting a job which i eventually did in the middle of fkin nowhere. I moved away from probably the only good thing I have in my life, family and the one or two good friends I had. 3 months into the job I realised its fkin bs. dont need a 4 year degree for it. I am getting zero experience related to my field. I cant seem to get any other jobs and I cant quit cause family needs the money so I am trapped. Meanwhile my life passes me by, weekends I sleep, weekdays i work. Everyone else is going on holidays, hanging with friends and gfs. Tried to put my effort in gyming and bodybuilding to get a bit of confidence but after 6 months I made little progress. Turns out my caolries per day was way under. All that effort with exercises and diets have gone to waste. My local gym also closed down. My biggest problem is I am nervous around people, I am not witty or funny except to a few of my friends.

So in a few months I'll be hitting the big three oh, and pretty excited about doing something fun to celebrate. I've historically planned events for my birthdays, from getting 12 pairs of my friends to compete in a race through a corn maze to late-night pancakes and margaritas, to a standard bar crawl.  But for 30 I want to do something cool and special.

This is confounded slightly by the fact that nowadays my friends are pretty spread out.  I myself recently moved to a new state and left a bulk of my friends behind.  So I'm trying to think of things that could unite people from across the country, but not be too expensive or put too much of a demand on their time.  We're all working professionals, you know?

I've had a few basic ideas like Vegas trip, mountain cabin rental, etc. But there's a surprising dearth of real human experiences to pull from from a quick Google search.  You guys previously steered me [very right](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/4iact3/help_me_curate_the_ultimate_playlist_of_bangers/) when it came to curating a party playlist, so I know you've got good times ready to go.

29,"Yeah Man, you are here. You are in your late teens and you had only a couple of dates. Probably, you haven't get laid yet. Probably, everyone around you says ""You are a nice guy, how are you single?""
or Dat type o' shit. But you are still a virgin and yo don't have a girlfriend. You are looking forward to get a job, or progress in college. And you are stuck in your shell. But what if i told you that you can get laid every week, have 2 or 3 gf at the same time, hustle thru your lyfe, and enjoy your days as a late teen? Well you will, if you read this.

I will start with the facts you've probably  ignored first. (It'll hurt bro)
1.No hot girl in her late teens or early twenies like nice guys. Nice guys are girls' interest when they're in their late twenies and early thirties (Because marriage.)
2.Cut your relationship with the people saying you are a nice guy. Because these people want you to grow into 50 year old virgins, so that they cun fuck all the pussies.
3.No need to be romantic when you don't have a gf. 

These are only 3 of the facts you either don't know or ignore.
Now, here comes the active part. 

1. Do not shave often. Yeah you heard me right. If you stick around with a clean shaved look in your face, you won't look mature. Instead people can look at your babyface and laugh their ass off. Leaving a little hair on your chin is good. But you can go with other beard styles too. 
2. Stop dressing with Dadwear style. It maybe free and comfy, but it'll make you look stewpid.
3.Stop making family-friendly jokes and gestures. you don't have to be soft and nice. Instead, go with a robust and mean style. 
4.stop wearing dress shirts and pants. Go with tees and jeans instead. Now, i don't want you to sell or throw your ""NiceGuyClothing"" just place tehem far away in your wardrobe. 
5.Stop being organized. Just be messy and be as casual as possible. 
6.Stop eating restaurant or home food. Go with the junk food instead. Because you will need a lot of calories when hustlin'
7. Do not use your parents' car. Instead, borrow a dirty lookin' ride from one of your friends, and don't give it back until they come and take it. You can also buy a second hand cheap car. 
8. Trash your mannerisms, and act like a douche. Do not try to be nice around old people or kids. Just yell at 'em. (""Get d fuk outta my way"" for instance.)
9. Get kinky about sex. Yeah, when you get kşnky, you also get more perverted by time. That will keep your sex drive at it's peak.
10. Summon a wolf pack. Find sum friends and hang out with them. Create slangs and nicknames and gestures in pack. Hustle with them, go to parties with them, beat jerks with them and don't forget, get as reckless and savage as possible. Put out some challenges in between.
11. Learn prison and thug slang. yeah, how can you create slangs without learning the ones that exist. 
12. Stop reading books, going to theatre or culture nights. Go with partyin' and video games and shooting range instead.

30,"Apparently, we're not allowed to fucking defend ourselves. Yes, I asked a very simple, VERY INNOCENT question about why women give dudes dirty looks, because some have admitted that it's a shy thing. If they are attracted to them, they'll try and hide that feeling by showing something the opposite. So I wanted to learn more.

Well shit, I guess trying to learn new thing's is a fucking crime.

This was part of some research, and I'm harassed and attacked by various member's of /r/askwomen and upon trying to defend myself, I'm the one who get's banned. Yeah, I flipped my lid. Wasn't my day, and I did notrhing at all to be attacked by so many random nobodies. I don't have to take that shit from anyone. I shouldn't have to.

The best part? No punishment for them. Great :D enabling abuse, very mature. Very intelligent. ^/sarcasm

And instead of looking into it, the mods disregarded everything. Nice, mods are abusive too :D

But, what's funny is, these nobodies, do what they do, because nobody likes them.

Oh well.

Oh, /r/askwomen labeled it as an agenda post. Um, on what delusional planet are they living on? What fucking agenda lmao, the pursuit of knowledge? Oh, right, that's a crime, I forgot, sorry.

Same with /r/mensrights . Another joke of a sub with fucking jokes for mods.

**Remember kids, it's very bad for you to defend and stick up for yourself, you should let people bully you to the point of wanting to kill yoursefl; Well, that's essentially how the admins and some mods of reddit feel. Personally, I say stand up for yourself. Don't let people walk all over you.**

35,"I'm a 23 year old, suicidal, clinically depressed single man. I do have friends at work and today there was a ""night out"" at the local pub. One of the lot brought their baby along. I'd never held a baby before out of the sheer anxiety of dropping the poor thing. 

However, I thought myself ""if there's ever a good time..."" 
I held the three month baby and watching it and interacting with him nearly bought tears to my eyes, I was so happy. 

It really confirmed to me that I want to be a Dad so much, so much, but am aware of the faint chance of that ever happening. 

But still for those ten minutes, I never wanted a child of my own more. I'd hope it wouldn't develop the same mental traits his dad had. 

I'm not sure what the point to this is sorry",03Aug2017,5
36,"So, a little history. 48 year old married, straight man. I've had anal sex with about 20 women, including my wife. Got turned on to pegging and tranny porn about 3 years ago. That was about as far as I'd really had any fascination of anal on myself. Fast forward. I jack off a lot. I'm in a deadbedroom with my wife as she's had two cancers and a myriad of other issues, including a  hysterectomy. She has no skills, even after 20 years of marriage. No stamina, Cant ride me for any more than 15 minutes without stopping due to pain in her legs. No libido due to all her medical issues, takes Synthroid, has had radiation, Hysterectomy I mentioned and three lesions removed from her liver. I gained weight, 6'3"", 240 lbs. Have had two back surgeries. I had a blood test done and my testosterone was low. Knowing it could have positive side effects, I have chosen to have weekly injections of 200 mg. Within the first week, my libido is up. I jack off 5-6 times per day. Look at porn constantly. Today I decided to try a small object in my anus. It wasn't big enough to have the desired euphoria. So, I got something about the size of a hammer handle. Lubed all areas up and began the insertion. On my knees, Object between my ankles and began to sit down, adjusting for angles and pleasure as the object disappeared. I got about 8""- 9"" in and it felt amazing! I'll be hooked on this. I can easily feel why anal whores and stretching are a real thing. Time to invest in safer objects. In no way does this make me gay as there is no relationship/ attraction to men.

39,"Last summer my best friend, Nick, invited me to work security at a music festival with him to make a little money over the weekend. I had a yellow belt in Judo when I was a kid. That is about the only qualification I had to contribute to the job. But the security company was desperate for people so they hired me as a kind of music festival mercenary.


The first day was our own. We would show up, set up our tents and have the day to ourselves to do whatever we liked. When we arrived we were greeted with hulking machines, as large as dinosaurs, and a host of dread-locked white people escorting us on where to park and set up. This place was farm land, and the people who ran the festival paid them some great sum of money for the space to host.


After we had set up camp, Nick and I decided to head down for a swim. We brought lawn chairs, a few IPA's and a couple of joints for good measure. I mean, we were looking forward to a day to ourselves. A step away from the city life. We saw it as a chance to look at some trees and avoid getting sunburned.


On our walk down to the river, Nick told me to wait up for a minute.



""Let them get ahead of us,"" he mumbled as we watched our fellow guards walk away.


""What's going on?"" I said.


""I brought some mushrooms for us. We can split them in half but I don't have enough for everyone.""


Now, I dabble in these kind of things recreationally, so at the time it seemed like a great idea. Of course, most bad ideas seem like good ideas at the point of inception.


We split the mushrooms. 50/50. To this day they're the worst I've ever had. Hard, chewy, and oddly strange to taffy in that they lodged themselves in our teeth and refused to surrender. Then we went down to the river and set up headquarters for what was supposed to be a pleasant mental vacation.


Down at the river, Nick and I put away a couple of beers. Some girls came over and started talking to us, and things were going according to plan. Better than the plan.


And then Tate shows up.


Tate was the organizer of our misfit security squad. He was maybe a year older than us, and just as irresponsible. Tate comes trotting down the trail and calls out to us.


""Yo Nick, you have to move your car. They say that it's in the way.""
Now I don't know who ""they"" is but it's clear that they weren't filled in on the mental activities we had just subjected ourselves to. Nick didn't know what to say. What could he say?


""I'll be right there,"" he said before beckoning me to come with him. Being the good friend I am, I joined him for the excursion.
I'm not sure what you're experience level is with psychedelics, but there is a sort of calm before the storm. We weren't feeling normal, but it hadn't settled and it was our goal to get the car to where it needed to be before that happened.


Where we needed to move our car to was a parking lot located like 3 miles away from the campground. Thankfully the place was fairly desolate so we were able to get there pretty quickly without endangering anyone besides maybe ourselves.


Once we arrived we saw a car parking lot with a line just full of freshly parked cars, and anacondaesque line of people waiting to be escorted back.


Outside was so hot it made you doubt the existence of God. I saw peoples shoes literally melting on the blacktop waiting for a car to return them to camp, and here we were.Nick and I. Two irresponsible, stupid assholes without any water who happened to have taken magical mushrooms. And in that line, all at once, we start tripping our fucking faces off.


It was too much. Way too much. Everything felt too hot, and yet somehow cold. Our skin just didn't belong to us. And we were convinced that we were dying of thirst.


The line we were standing in was Space Mountain at Disney Land. It refused to budge. We waited for as long as we could. But the sensory overload, combined with an quenchable thirst led us to consider our only alternative: Walking back.


The walk was 3 miles down a road, with a turn into the forest at some point we couldn't quite recall. It was a choice between dying on our own terms or on someone else's, and we rolled the dice.
The sun struck without mercy. We had no sunscreen, and mutated into cartoonish devil versions of ourselves. We walked for what seemed like 10 miles before we considered giving up, and submitting to nature. And then we saw it.


A light blue mini-van coasting down the highway. We watched it grow in size as it approached us. A savior in the form of a soccer mom. She pulled over.


""Are you guys going to the _________ festival?"" She asked.


""Yes,"" we replied.


""Do you guys want a ride? We don't have any more seats, but we have A/C and you can ride in the trunk.""
We thanked her for saving our lives. Agreed, and headed towards the back of the car.


I need to make an obscure reference here only because the nature of this reference is so perfect that there is no other option. There's a scene in Game of Thrones where Varys is telling Tyrion about the wizard who castrated him. Varys takes him to a box in his room and opens it, and inside we see a decrepit wizard who looks like he's been living in that box for a thousand years.


We opened the trunk of the car and see ANOTHER person already back there. He looked exactly like the wizard.


We were deceived. There was no A/C to speak of. In fact, I'm fairly confident there was a bonfire somewhere in the middle of the car contributing to the temperature. And there we were. Two full grown men, trapped in the back of some strangers car with a third person who looked like they might actually be dead. And here in our most glorious moment, the shrooms begin to hit their peak effect.


I can't say how long we were back there. Truth be told, if I tried to be honest it would be inaccurate, but with all of my heart I truly believed that that was how I was going to die. Huddled in the back of a mini-van, amongst a plethora of women's luggage and a strange man, high as the heavens themselves.


Thankfully we survived. We got to a point where we saw a river, and knew we were close. Nick begged to be let out of the car, and was told that it was just up ahead. I made a compelling case that I was about 11 seconds away from vomiting and she was swayed by my argument.


She let us out on the side of the road, and we wandered through the forest towards the campgrounds. It was miserable, but better than it had been in the recent past.


There was a mirage in the trees. A hidden camp that looked like it was crafted by intelligent apes. Trunks of trees were bound together and formed a wall encircling a towering structure. Nick and I drew closer only to realize that it wasn't a mirage at all, but part of the festival. We followed the curve of the wall to an entrance an inside was a friendly looking hippie smoking weed out of a glass pipe.


The structure was a human-sized cat scratching post 3-stories tall. The first floor provided seats, the second was a large bed littered with pillows, and the third a deck big enough to fit 10-15 people. It was the strangest miracle I've ever seen. Jesus didn't have shit on this thing.


The man offered us water, of which we graciously accepted, and invited us to climb on the structure that he created. We climbed to the top, thanked the man, and smoked a joint with him to commemorate the moment. Then we climbed down, back down to the earth, and proceeded to enjoy the rest of the trip with our minds hovering somewhere closer to Mars.

All the work that everyone does is on the file server. There is no concrete system to organize files, so right from the home directory you have New Folder, Docs, MISC, EMILY'S NEW DOCS, Publications, Logos, Devices and Programs, Programs, QZFs (What?), Old Materials, and at least 30 random files with random titles and names. 

Sweet Baby Jesus.

Under every folder is a maze of subfolders with similar sounding names, and an OLD folder with a duplicate file structure. No indication of what the cutoff between current and old is. Oh yeah, and if you're looking for the folder titled *Subject XYZ*, you'll find one in the home directory and about twelve other subfolders.
