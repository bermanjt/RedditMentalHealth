1,"Eight months ago, my world had imploded.  My adult son was in a car crash and suffered a severe brain injury.  One day, I posted this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/thegrandtour/comments/5h1j2u/watching_the_grand_tour_has_become_painful_for_me/  
&amp;nbsp;  
Since then, my son spent five months in the hospital.  He started talking again - then suffered a setback and lost his speech in February.  In late June, he started talking again.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0Od7J4v39I 
&amp;nbsp;  
When he came home from the hospital, they ordered a custom wheelchair for him.  They had me get my van modified with a ramp because he couldn't sit properly in a car seat.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Well, the jokes on them.  The human brain is an amazing thing with a great capacity to heal.   He started outpatient rehab in late July, and has blown them away with his progress.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM6rk7x-33Q
&amp;nbsp;  

I'm posting this today because even now - many months later, the occassional random Redditor messages me and asks how my son is doing.  I can't begin to tell you all how your caring helped support me on the many down days.

Edited - fixed the youtube links.

8,"I'm sorry if this sounds cheesy or melodramatic, but I need to write this down somewhere.

Im a sixteen year old kid in my junior year of high school. I have six credits so far. I was diagnosed with depression, and it's been an uphill battle. Some times I feel as if any motivation in my body is gone. But last night I ""woke up"" . I had a dream if my late grandfather who had been a Vietnam vet. He was sitting on a bench, looking into the horizon. I sat next to him and he sighed. He turned to look at me and and asked me why I was giving up so early. It's my junior year, so I figured it was too late. He continued on about how it was just the beginning and there is a place for me in this world, that I can still grow. But in order to do that I needed to find hope. This confused me. Hope is lost on me entirely at this point, a d hearing him say that like it was so easy kind of irked me.
I told him that I had tried and failed in which he responded with. ""No, you haven't."" I got angered. He had no idea what I felt like and he had no right to tell me I hadn't tried. He then explained in detail about how hope was just an ingredient to growing from my position to success. How hope is the main motivator, and how hope is the main ingredient, along with determination, and hard work.
This is when the dream was coming to an end. This is when he looked me in the eye and said ""find it. I know you can"" I woke up and cried at three in the morning.

He has made me feel something that has been lost on me. Hope. I can't say it's gonna last forever, but for now, I am feeling like I can do it. After so long of being looked down upon, of being taunted and being chastised, I feel like I can do it. My hope? I want to see them smile. I want them to be proud. I want them to see me grow. And I especially want my grandfather to smile down from wherever he is. It's a long road to victory, but I'm gonna take it. I'm sorry, if this is weird, I'm on mobile. Thanks for reading.

Thanks Pa. I'll make you proud.",25Aug2017,2
9,"My (  sorta ) step mom that has been with my dad for 5 years, they brokeup ( weren't married ) in March, and everything is good as far as us keeping in touch, so that's not the issue. 


Basically, last Wednesday she called me after she got home from work, then later I texted her a picture of my messy room ( been working alot ) since I know she fusses about it. This was the text conversation.

Her: Did I not tell you I had a long day, now I have to fuss at you to? Clean your damn room, and send pictures.

So I cleaned it and sent her the picture.

Her: Very good.








Me: Cool, well good night.








Her: No not good night, how about your bathroom?

Me:  Shit.


Her: What???



I sent the picture of the clean bathroom.












Her: And your closet?











Me: Seriously??

Her: I'm your step mom I get to be mean :).












Me: Well I'm happy to have you as a step mom.


I sent the picture of the clean closet. 

Her:  Great, now goodnight, love you.

Me: Love you to, good night :D.



She's never said that to me before ever, not in person, not over the phone, not even when she was together with my father. I know I SHOULD take her at face value, and it's not that I don't trust her, it's just, maybe she didn't say it with the same meaning as I received it? Perhaps she said it absentmindedly? Or maybe she just said that as  a joking way in congratulating me for cleaning everything?











Here's the part that confuses me a tad bit. A few days after that I texted her to tell her that we lost our recreational football game, since she wanted to know how it went. So this is the text conversation that took place. 

Her: Oh ok, you've been on my mind all day I wasn't sure, don't let this discourage you, use this loss as motivation to play harder next time.








Me: Thanks I will.














A few minutes later.







Me: Hey, thanks again for supporting me with this, love you.

Her: I'll always be there for you. ( That's something she'd say more often )













Now as I said previously, I maybe overthinking, but she didn't exactly say "" love you back "" so I'm a little confused. Maybe she meant it in a casual friendly way, and not in a family type way like I thought? I can respect it if she doesn't feel that way, but because she said it first, that's what made me feel comfortable to say it aswell after the game. I think if she isn't comfortable with that, or doesn't feel that way ( which I can respect if that's the case ), I believe she didn't really need to say it in the first place, since that's not entirely fair towards myself, so I am a tad bit frustrated but only just because of the confusion. She's a pretty affectionate person, so I wouldn't think she has trouble expressing emotion.














I know it didn't cause any awkwardness, because we spoke after that nothing was weird everything was the same , and she picked me up to have lunch with her and her daughter like always.


I don't really want to bring this up towards her. Your thoughts on this?",25Aug2017,2
10,"I moved across the country with my cat last October and the first chance he got to go outside, Leo ran for it. 

I posted on the local Facebook, asked around to anyone I could find, he's even microchipped with my information attached. I was desperate to find him but I got no leads. 

I'm moving back across the country in 14 days. Yesterday I got a message from a woman who lives in the town he ran away in saying that a black cat showed up around the same time that he went missing, hangs out in the dumpsters at night (Leo was quite nocturnal) all by himself, picking fights with the local cats (Leo was quite antisocial to other cats) 

I have a strong feeling it's really him. 

I hope it is. 

But the issue is here--I'm moving back to go to school and I will be in student housing when I get there. Cats are not allowed and I could be evicted if they find one. Leo has always had access to the outdoors and since I'll be in a 4th floor 180sq.ft. apartment, he will not be able to access the outdoors at all. 

If I do bring him to Seattle, I will find a new place to live after my lease expires next year. 

Would it be cruel to take him with me and hole him up in a tiny room for a year? I care deeply about this cat and I feel solely responsible for his well being. If I find out it's him and I don't take him, I may never live it down. But if it makes him miserable I need another solution. I don't know what to do. Any advice is very much appreciated.",25Aug2017,5
12,"Just watched Truman's Show, and that is disturbing! Even though I know creating something like that is unfathomable, it still catches me. Sometimes, when I'm all alone, I stop doing something crazy or weird because someone may be watching me. When i overhear people's conversations, it looks like they were talking about me. This is actually driving me anxious, because there might be a hidden camera in the faucet when I shower. What do I do?",25Aug2017,7
15,"In the back of my grandpa's car my collection of stuff makes a mess. I laid back there under stars but the cold kept me up. Back and forth, home to home. One month earlier I was a painter and my mom was so proud. Portrait sits on a shelf, forgot I left it before I left town. There were roads I had to travel so I headed out. It's too late to recooperate it. That stupid painting. It shares the same fate as the one who drew it. Hang it up against others like it and its as empty as my grandpa's car on the hill. I have become such a sentimental person, but it's so easy to slip back into mushiness.. but maybe if i can unpack the car, then maybe i can learn how to paint again like a child without a song who can make his own rhythms.

18,"My grandpa has congestive heart failure. I moved in with him and my grandmother eight years ago. He had just retired and I was in a bad situation that needed to change. I can't drive (vision problems) and it gave my grandpa purpose to drive me around every day. He loved having something to look forward to every day and I loved our time together. We talked about everything on our rides to work, we listened to music and I even gave him a Jim Croce CD that he listened to all the time in his truck. He loved the ""built like a 'fridgerator with a head"" line in Roller Derby Queen especially. Every day after work we would stop at the store and I would get us drinks, he really liked Sundrop and Mountain Dew. 

Fast forward to this year and after having a somewhat simple outpatient surgery he changed, he couldn't drive anymore became much more confused and unable to take care of every day tasks on his own. He's at the point now that he could be in and out of hospital for the rest of his life. He did not want that and so we brought him home and he is on hospice care now. 

Remember when I said I gave him purpose in life when I came to live with them? Earlier this year I had to quit my job because my vision has gotten worse and I was diagnosed with a cataract. I can get it removed but its riskier than most people due to my pre-existing issues and money is also an issue. I have been feeling useless not being able to provide for myself. Taking care of my grandpa has given me purpose in life again but on the other hand it tears me up inside watching him deteriorate slowly. He's my best friend and I will be lost without him. 

I'm not writing this for sympathy. Its just something I needed to share. Our relationship has come full circle. I am just unsure what life will be like when he's gone. The roaring train of mortality is coming down the track and there's nothing I can do to stop it. 

Sorry for the wall of text. Thank you for reading. Hug your loved ones. Good day.",25Aug2017,219
19,"I'm 18. I feel pathetic. I don't want to be at all self-pitying but my heart feels overwhelmingly sad. my lack of friends or anyone is probably it. I feel like I've failed everything in life. I haven't been attending classes to avoid a 'friend' that hurt me deeply and when I apologise for the things she find undesirable in me or when I feel down she says I'm offending her and she's just difficult to deal with. everything she finds something not at all nice, I just want to die. Why did I befriend this person. she doesn't give a  shit about me. She just wants me around because I listen. That's it. I wish I had never replied to her message. I wished I had stayed away from her. I wished I hadn't met her. 

I'm alone. My heart hurts. I don't know what to do. I know I should do my work, my assignments at least. Read up catch up but I don't know it feels useless. I feel so empty. So alone. can someone, anyone. say hi to me, can I say hi back to you? Can we be friends supportive of each other? I need someone, I'm so weak. I don't know what to do. The only supporter in my life has been gone since I was 14. My mum. I've continued feeling alone since then and I feel like I'm on my breaking point now.

Someone help me. Someone say something. I haven't talked with anyone in so long. Please say hi. Please say goodbye. Please say something. Please be my close friend. Please let me be yours. I want to help you, I want you to help me. Is anyone out there? Is anyone at all there? Am I going crazy? Maybe. My heart hurts. It just hurts It just hurts and I don't know 

Hold my hand hold my heart hold my something. Someone support me please I'll support you back just don't hold a grudge on me please forgive me for any mistakes I do I don't mean to harm you if you're offended please don't please don't I feel pathetic. 

I love the thought of exploring the world, of learning new languages, of learning how the universe works in general, of building friendships with others but I feel like I'm dying right now from a lack of friends and I feel dead

I feel dead. I feel dead. I need someone to turn to, to talk to, for guidance, help me I feel so alone but there are so many things I want to do I don't want to die, I don't want to be alone, I want to go out and take pictures and record and edit and share them with others I want to do cool things and share my results with others, to discuss future projects I wish I could afford the equipment needed to do these things

20,"I'm a dude who's really sad on his looks. I'm short, Indian, have acne, flat moles and scars on my face. I think I'm really ugly. When I told my therapist I'll never be on the level of the guys that crush hangs out with I started crying a lot. 

I workout six days a week (PPL) and I take acne medication which has made it nearly gone but I still have flat moles and acne scars. I plan on removing them with laser scar removal.

All the suspense and misdirection that imbues a punchline with its' impact, and they just post the punchline.

26,"I have social anxiety. I'm not withdrawn from others, but I have tendencies (difficulty remembering details about others - including names, impulsiveness, difficulty asking questions, etc) which can and have introduced awkwardness into my conversations. I am complimented by coworkers and people seem genuinely happy when I'm around, but frequently, I will later feel awful about myself based on mistakes that I've made. 

This has been going on my whole life, though with medication and therapy, it has gotten better. Though I still prefer to be alone, I am more willing and able to engage with others, and I've been actively working to improve those social impulses that tend to trigger the anxiety. I've also been able to, usually, forgive myself for silly mistakes if no on else has said anything, and apologize without getting down if they do. In other words, I'm doing the things.

Yesterday I used meetup to find a new player for my RPG. They seemed enthusiastic to join, and though two other members cancelled, we had a good/fun session. Later, I saw on meetup that that same new player was ""very excited"" to join someone else's game. 

This may or may not have anything to do with me. I have no idea. I really don't. He hasn't dropped out of my game, and gave no indication that he wasn't going to stick around, but my brain is convinced that he wasn't happy, and the reason is because I didn't social well enough. Despite all my mindfulness and active attempts to stay positive, I've been getting more and more down.

I'm honestly tired of this happening. I try really hard not to let that part of me take my joy. I actively focus on the good things, and I am mindful when my thoughts go this way, but there are days where all the strategies don't work. Today is one of those days.

I am going to be doing more self-care, and I'm going to continue to redirect my brain when it begins to speculate needlessly, but god dammit do I wish I didn't have to.",25Aug2017,1
27,"He's been working on cars for over 35 years and his place of employment is screwing him over big time. Because they're remodeling the building, they have to take away stalls, meaning less people working throughout the day for much longer than normal.

They are expecting my dad, at over 60 years old, with a bad leg, to work 6AM to 6PM Wednesday through Saturday for the next SIX weeks. They're also prioritizing some punk ass kid, (who, from what I understand, has a shitty attitude and is NOT qualified to be doing the majority of the work) over my dad and they've been giving my dad nothing but the shittiest work for months now. When he talks to the service manager, all the manager does is err on the side of this kid. And when he confronted the service writers about why they've been giving him shitty work, they go silent and have nothing to say.

My dad is the hardest working, most loving and caring man I know with the biggest heart (now I'm crying) and he's spent his life busting ass and wrenching away at cars. He does it for my family, my sister who has epilepsy, he's done everything for her. My mom is a huge help around the house and with my sister as well, and is also only within the past few years receiving money for caring for my sister, financial support they discovered they could have been receiving for years now. I also work full time in the car business, have been for 5 years now, as a lot attendant. I've got my problems too, and I know I'm young at 26, but working full time is also taking its toll on me. People tell me to get another job but I'm not trying to kill myself either. 

So, anyway, because of the occupation, my dad has spent a lot of time leaning over cars and it has weakened the joints in his legs. His right leg is bad and he's been waiting to get it done, waiting to meet his deductible. And now, today, they give him the worst schedule out of anybody. He's done working there. There's no one here can talk to there, they're not listening to his side of things. Human resources can't be reasoned with, such a thing is just a joke around there.

He's going to come to the dealership I work at and apply for a technician position, but he will have to start all over again with his insurance, going back to square one in the process of meeting the deductible, which he was so close to meeting. He needs a quality of life fix for his leg and now it's not going to happen. And he's been like this for years now, doing what he can to get the pain to go away, but nothing has worked. It's basically a surgery or nothing gets done for a long time again.",25Aug2017,5

35,"This post will sound insanely stupid, but it reas written when I was drunk and I felt like I had to get some shit off my chest. I always knew I liked this girl I work with. It built up slowly, but it's grown and grown and now I'm into her a hell of a lot. We just are on the same wavelength for so much shit. I hate exaggerating and idealising or whatever, but at times it feel like Jim and Pam in The Office. We can share one look st each other and know exactly what the other is thinking, and often burst out laughing.

But she has a boyfriend. I know deep down I'm not gonna be with her while that's going on. But part of me wants to be with her so bad man. Tonight I went to a party with her and some work colleagues and honestly every time I was near her was fucking magic. She compliments me on shit other people don't notice or find annoying. She genuinely cares about me, which is more than can be said for a lot of people. It's just good to feel appreciated by someone you like man. Like if she has an option of who to talk to or sit with or whatever nine times out of ten she'll choose me. And that honestly means the world. She's naturally flirty, but with me it's kinda different. She doesn't obviously flirt, she kinda does it more subtly if that makes sense. Like with other guys it's obvious when she's having a flirty joke, but with me it's more ambiguous and kind of hidden off, as if she feels shy about it.

I don't really know why I wrote this. In all honesty I'm still a little drunk. I watched guys from work get with random girls they've never met and try set me up too, and I couldn't do it. I couldn't hook up with some random girl because all I could think of was her. It's honestly fucking awful cause shit man, she's in a relationship. I shouldn't feel this way towards a good friend. But she's honestly amazing and I can't get enough of her. It's insane. I've never, ever felt this way about anyone in my life. I've had crushes, but not this shit. Nobody prepared me for feeling this way. 

I dunno. I know it's not gonna happen but being around her is often the highlight of my week, even in my shitty job. Being around her at a party with alcohol involved made me realise just how deep it went though. If I wasn't talking to her, I was desperate to find a way to. It sounds so cringy and stupid, but I've fallen head over heels for this girl and I have no idea how I'm ever gonna get over it. She's not perfect. She's judgemental, moody, closed off at times and hard to get to know.  But I know her and fuck. It makes up for it all. Today at this party, just talking shit with her and instinctively laughing at shit around us, like it's one big inside joke, I genuinely could have died happy man. That sounds fucking pathetic, but it's true. 

It feels like so much more than a stupid crush. Usually I crush on girls I don't really know and idealise her. But I really, really do know her, and every little thing I find out makes me like her even more. She's just the best person to be around. And as it stands I can't be with her. And it's so fucking painful man. All I get to live with is little hilarious and warm moments with a girl who sees me as a very good friend. I can't tell whether I love it or not. And I don't want this to sound like some 'friendzone' bullshit, cause honestly that shit's fucking stupid and I can't change who she likes, but it is still hard to be a friend when feeling this way regardless. I do my best, but man it tears me up. My fault for not taking a chance sooner though I suppose.

**TL;DR:** Insanely into coworker friend who has a boyfriend. We had a party together and it was fucking amazing. I felt like I could talk to her for the rest of my life and not get bored. Feel pathetic, but had to rant about how I feel.

I was reminded of that kind of comedy where someone will say something ridiculous, and the other person will just say 'No that's not true' and I wondered if that was kind of a bad way to start the improve with this man. He said no it is and list some other weird name for a drug, and I decided to try to play along, so I said 'Oh yeah, I do that all the time. You have to watch out, it's pretty addicting.'  
Then things got pretty intense and we were both talking really quickly and excitedly, to where I finished our improv by saying really three fake elements really quickly, like 'Tiniitum, tillaium, tifilium!' but for some reason the were related to being a chipmunk.

I then met a Japanese couple, who were trying to get me to have a threesome with them. I was wondering how I could be apart of it, without having to be with the Japanese man. I suddenly remembered that I had some left over marijuana.  I realized that I wanted to have this experience high, so I 
For some reason, my marijuana came in the form of pills, and I was confused because my marijuana pills were in my vitamin bottle, and my vitamin pills were in my marijuana pill bottle.  
For some reason there were so many pills, and I was contemplating if I should take them one at a time, or if I could manage to swallow multiple pills at once.  
I was in a hurry, because the three some with the Japanese couple had turned into a rowing class in a swimming pool, nude. There was this other guy, who was also trying to swallow his drug pills quickly as well.  
I noticed that on the other side of the room, there was chanting. 
I walked over and behind a kind of fence were a bunch of young nerdy men chanting 'Where are the women? Where are the women?' I think they had been tricked or promised that women would be there, and they were growing angry.
