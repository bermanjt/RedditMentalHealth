Edit:Also don’t know if this is the right place to put this. **


About ten years ago I was out shopping and this lady came up to me and said something like “I love your style where’d you buy your clothes” etc. I was weirded out but I was trying to be polite. 


Then she gets to her point. She said her church was doing some kind of event where they’re getting a bunch of young people together, like a sort of get to know each other thing. She said there would be live music and food and games to which I thought why not? So I gave her my number and she said she would contact me with more info (don’t judge me I was a teenager). I forget how long after she called but she did. 


Now this is where it gets really weird. She told me over the phone that it would be required that I get picked up and taken to the venue. HELL NO. So I told her I don’t think my mom would be comfortable with that. She says something like “if you’re worried about being picked up at your house we can pick you up at a public location.” The fact that she kept pushing this and not telling me an address made me VERY VERY uncomfortable so now I was looking for a way out. I tell her no my mom said she would feel more comfortable if she could drop me off to which this lady replies “don’t worry tell her that it’s sponsored by a church and you’re going to be safe”. So again I tell her no she wants to know where I’m going. She says that the driver will be picking up other people in my area and that the car ride is supposed to be part of the get to know each other process. I tell her I want an address. She says “you know what maybe this event just isn’t for you. Okay then, goodbye” she sounded frustrated? More than anything. And that was that and I forgot all about it. 

Only now in my adult hood am I questioning how strange that was. Ive never heard of any event like that. Anybody know of any church event that this could be? Was it some kind of scam? I don’t want to believe it was anything more sinister. But who the hell doesn’t even tell the parents of strange teenagers where their child will be??


tldr: Strange lady for some church event insisted I be picked up by her people and recanted my invitation when I asked where I was going to be taken to. ",29Nov2017,1

18,"Okay, look, I'm never one to believe that ""The Fault in Our Stars"" bullshit. Where this good guy falls in love with this girl (no offense to people with differences) that's obviously not ""in his league"". I always told myself to keep it real and that ""true love"" bull crap was nothing but movies and books....
Until this moment. I was on a plane and long story short, there was this big woman, maybe around 400 lbs. She was pretty short too, maybe around 5'2. She was basically Chrissy Metz on a plane. No lie, she was the same size (and body shape) as the actress from This is Us, but her face was obviously different. She had blonde hair and good looking blue eyes. And her laugh was bubbly and sweet, really cute. She had a nice personality from how I read her during the flight (pretty good at reading people's personalities... Ahem, not to brag :3)

The guy sitting next to her (which I knew the second they held hands and locked eyes when they boarded) was an opposite. He had dark brown eyes, dark brown hair, and his voice was rough and very 'Brooklyn' accented. He was (betting here) probably from New York; more specifically, Brooklyn. He was pretty tall, maybe around 6'3 or higher, and he was built. Real built. He had biceps and everything, he wasn't _ripped_ per say, but he looked almost like a thug from a seriously hardcore gang.
He was this buff, thug looking guy, dating this obese (but I'll admit, a cute obese woman) and innocent looking woman. They were both probably in their mid-twenties.

This was the conversation that took place (Yes I was being rude and listening in. We all do it.)

Him: *with attitude* I can't believe the way that asshole treated you. 
Her: *Shy, obviously insecure* He had every right too... 
Him: No he didn't. Color blind people ain't got no right to talk to ya that way. It ain't your fault he's blind to ya 100 shades of beauty. 
Her: *obviously bashful, but trying to play off ""sassy""* When did you start becoming a romantic? 
Him: If I'm being honest; when I met ya. You're the first and only woman I ain't gonna play. 
Her: *stammers* You're being so corny... 
Him: I Will be if that's what it takes ta make ya see how beautiful you are. *smug but the ""honest to my grandmother"" smirk*

The rest of the ride, they were both just talking casually, but I honestly had a hard time believing my ears. The rest of the flight, I admit, I was a teeny bit jealous. At first, I thought he was one of those weird people who had a fetish with bigger partners. But then I ""accidentally"" heard this bit..

Her: We're gonna end up eating so much at this damned place. 
Him: Nah, I'll make sure you don't. 
Her: I'm gonna pig out anyways. 
Him: Yeah, with that attitude. Ya've got the counter app right? 
Her: Yeah... Remind me to use it, 'kay? 
Him: 'right. Don't worry, ya already lost a bit. If ya ain't positive of course ya gonna gain it all back.

At this moment, I died a bit inside. But I was also happy that a girl like her (Obviously going through some self hate problems that should always be addressed) found a guy to love her for her.

21,"We went from talking on the phone 4+ times a week to 0 contact. She moved from Florida to Georgia, and then from Georgia to somewhere else is where I lost her. I don’t know what happened. But I miss her greatly. I still have dreams about her sometimes. I decided to search up her mom’s name and the zip code from her old address, and I think I found her. It gave me a list of her addresses, one of which was where she had lived before, as well as three phone numbers. I texted the one I thought would most likely be Mallory’s, the secondary phone number, and plan on calling the other two sometime tomorrow afternoon. My heart is beating so rapidly and I’m trying hard not to cry. If I’ve found her again, and she actually is living in Florida once more, I’ve got to see her when I go home for Christmas. I still miss her so much. She is part of the reason I am who I am today. If this turns out to be a dead lead, I’ll be heartbroken... but at least I’m prepared for it. 

Please wish me luck

24,"Title says it all. Oh, it doesn't? Ok:

This guy lived here for five years and was a massive grump. We started out on friendly enough terms but by the end we basically weren't on speaking terms for the entire last year he lived here. He didn't work or go to school, and rarely left his room. For five years. I don't think he had any friends, except for my friends that came over to play board games from time to time. Maybe he thought of me as a friend. I feel kind of bad saying this, because I like almost everyone, but I never really liked the guy. He was rude and perpetually negatively disposed towards me. He radiated negativity on a daily basis. He always complained. Granted, I was and am a messy roommate, so he had some grounds for complaint. But he hated everything. He hated that I would smoke pot. He hated that I would get drunk. He hated that I would watch history and economics and philosophy and psychology lectures on youtube. I think he hated that I was smarter, happier, more interested in life, and more successful with women, despite taking almost nothing seriously and being a big goofball slacker stoner.

Anyway, he got a girlfriend *somehow*, and it turns out she's a university classmate of mine, although she's quite a bit younger than me. We have a bunch of classes together, and we start talking, and at some point randomly when we're studying together, she tries to kiss me out of nowhere. I was taken aback, and wasn't really ok with it, because she was dating my roommate. I probably should have put a stop to any interaction with her right there. But for some reason, I didn't. She was very persistent, and attractive, and eventually wore me down.

The roommate eventually moved out...into a two-bedroom apartment with his now-ex-girlfriend...who I've been on-again off-again sleeping with ever since. Of all our friends (meaning my friends, some of whom became his friends by association), two have remained friends with him, and no longer speak to me.

Did I do a bad thing?

I just can't bring myself to feel remotely bad. Mostly I am pretty stoked; I no longer dread coming home at the end of the day. My house is a happier place. But I can't help but shake the feeling that *maybe* I should feel bad. I am even considering that maybe I am becoming even more negatively-disposed towards this guy in order to reduce any cognitive dissonance I might otherwise feel. When I do think about him at all, which isn't often, if I feel anything it's mostly satisfaction. A little bit of contempt, maybe the tiniest amount of pity. I don't wish him ill, but I also take a perverse satisfaction in knowing that I won. I showed him. He always tried to challenge and frustrate me, and I won. I always win. Get in my way and I will smack you down hard. I shouldn't be proud of this...should I?

I don't brag about any of this, except to my brother, who is annoyed by it even though he agrees that former roommate is a douche. And I can't help but feel like most of my friends, who I think see me as a nice person, would be horrified to learn all this. Is this my dark side? My shadow self?

Should I see a psychologist? Am I a sociopath who is inappropriately not bothered by things that should bother me? Or am I just an otherwise good person who did something I shouldn't be proud of and has rationalized it away like most people do?

25,"First of all, I’m sorry for the title. It is not click bait, I assure you. 

Before I delve into the subject further, I would like to clarify some things: This is a story about how my uncle sexually molested me ever since I was fourteen (12) years of age in my first year of high school until now.

Feel free to comment on what you think about this. I won’t judge you for I consider every bit of ideas, no matter how far fetched they are, as helpful. And also, kindly don’t hate on other commenters just because their answers seem stupid to you. The rest of the things on this paragraph; I will leave to your common sense. 

Since this will take more than just a few minutes of your time, I took the liberty of organizing the paragraphs by timeline with an indication whether it is 1.) the story part or 2.) the argument.  

A quick background on my uncle. He’s still in college until now. Plays games all day. Is not good at socializing.

1.A.	1st year / 12 years old / Uncle is 24 years of age
It all started when my uncle, whom I was very close with since we tend to play video games together a lot, began showing signs of uncomfortable (for me) affection towards me. He would hug me from behind as I sat on the chair by his desk, while I was busy playing video games on his computer; then came more hugging, but in front this time…and in private. I remember he would randomly call for me to do just that and the act lasted for at least five seconds. And when I tried to pull away because of awkwardness and discomfort, he pull me back then let go after another few seconds. 

1.B.
I was twelve. Despite my discomfort, I didn’t know enough to make an accurate conclusion.

2.A.	2nd year / 13 years old / Uncle is 25 years of age
We’re still close. Then one time, when the rest of our relatives (who also lived in the same house) left to go shopping at the mall (or whatever and note that in our culture, two generations of family relatives sharing the same roof is common), he started acting more handsy by placing his hands on my breasts above my shirt then under, playing with my nipples when he got comfortable--even placing one hand on my crotch area. Now, you might be thinking, “Why isn’t she fighting back?” That is because he would do it whenever I was immersed in playing video games in his computer. 

2.B.	
I now grew scared. By that time, I was fully aware that I was being sexually harassed. 

3.A.	Summer of my 3rd year / 14 years old / Uncle is 26 years of age
I started fighting back by rejecting his advances. Whenever he would try to hug me from behind I would grab his forearms and pull them away from me. Then, he did this thing where he clasped my hands with his and said, “Are you fine with breaking the rules?” I felt like vomiting then and there. And when he did the same thing last year (2nd year), I told him—knowing that he was considering incest—“Don’t do those things to me since you have a girlfriend.” I hoped that it would at least shame him since if reasoning that I’m his niece wouldn’t make him blink, then using his current relationship with his girlfriend would’ve been the next option, right? But then he said, “Then it’s okay (to do this) if I didn’t have one?” It made me shudder. 

Then after some time off away from each other (a whole school year) came the time when my adolescent hormones have kicked in. Fast forward, I asked him to beat a level in an erotic lesbian game I was keen on finishing. 

3.B.
Honestly, I thought he was just delusional. But a nagging feeling kept on telling me that he was dead serious.

Now we had a secret--and two at that. 

4.A	Summer of 4th year / 15 years old / Uncle is 27 years of age
I felt lonely, because all the guys who asked me out were either too dumb (not in an intellectual sense, but in a theoretical one rather) or just now who I was into. You see, I was never to chase after boys. I had crushes here and there, but the feelings I have would just disappear as fast as I saw them. I wasn’t the type to spend my entire life studying either. But I was one to reach a specific goal and achieve it.

So, there is this time in a woman’s monthly cycle where we feel “vulnerable”. 

But don’t worry, no intercourse happened. But it would’ve, if I haven’t thought that he wasn’t wearing a condom. 
As he was about to enter, I pulled away and hastily went upstairs and locked the door.

The whole day after that incident, I didn’t eat or drink. I stayed in bed even when my grandmother told me to come down and eat with them. 

Later that night, I made sure to sleep beside my cousin since one side of her bed was against the wall. As I was about to sleep, I felt a piece of paper get thrown at me. It contained his apology for his actions. I crumpled it immediately. 

An hour later, I panicked as his body was above me. I looked beside me to see if my cousin was awake but she had always been a heavy sleeper (I knew she was at first but I assumed she would wake up if my uncle got the audacity to reach his hand to me while I was asleep). I was frozen. I couldn’t even scream. But thank God he didn’t do anything and just said he was sorry before leaving.

4.B.
I wasn’t going to lose my virginity to a family member and HIM of all people.
Now we have three secrets; where the third, included my short cooperation in the act.
I could’ve but… I was afraid of getting my cousin involved or worse, he could’ve choked me to death.

5.A.	College / 17 years old / Uncle is 29 years of age
I didn’t go to their house for the summer and focused on my life in the city where my college is located. 
I got the impression that he did change, or at least WAS trying. So I thought of an idea where I can use him.
This is where I thought I could use him to download games for me. He didn’t ask for anything in return.
I got a free admission to Taekwondo classes, and just when I was enjoying the sport, our instructor started to touch me in places and excuses them saying they were merely “massaging”. But what confirmed my suspicion was that he invited me out for drinks. He was already in his 40s.

5.B.
 This was when I learned how to control men. I also learned to stay away/cut off all ties to the men who proved to be difficult to control or figure out.

6.A.	College / 20 years old (present) / Uncle is 33 years of age
I thought everything was normal after what happened since the summer of my 4th year in high school. But… To be honest, there really isn’t an easier way in saying this but…. In summary, I was feeling like COMPLETE S . H.  I. T . I felt lonely, and thought that nobody loved me, even my parents because they NEVER give me recognition for my achievements. I grew up to be a chill person on the outside but a hollow abyss of crippling depression and anxiety inside. I had goals and am headstrong in getting to them but… at that time… I was vulnerable and lonely. 
And most of my relatives were away, while the ones who were at the house were in rooms far enough to not hear anything from where I lied. 

And then it happened again, my uncle pounced at me from behind, waking me from my sleep. Startled, I said, “What the fucc” which he replied in a whisper, “Stay like that for a second.”

I did, I could feel his heat pounding heavily from my back while I felt nothing in mine. I just wanted it to be over since I already have my own share of problems to deal with (e.g. my finals). But he still wouldn’t go away, until he kissed me and shoved his tongue inside my mouth. 

I didn’t know what got into me but we grinded at each other (while still having clothes on). Then I got on top of him. I didn’t feel anything but hate not on him but to myself. 

Then he switched positions where I was at the bottom, and that’s where I shoved him away.

And after a minute or so, he whispered “I’ll have difficulty in sleeping with this (boner).” 

I didn’t budge and rejected him until he gave up and jacked off in the bathroom next to my room.",29Nov2017,4

Current situation:


I've been up since 11 PM.  It's about 4 AM now.  I've pretty much finished my homework for tomorrow (I sleep all day after school and do it in the mornings).  I'm sitting in bed in my underpants, listening to eerie vaporwave.

I feel alone, isolated from society.  In my school, people know who I am, and treat me with respect, but I never seem to be able to form a personal connection with anyone.  I'd say I have a lot of acquaintances, but I hardly communicate with them unless circumstances bring us together.  All of my friends have better friends, and I know they talk to me simply because I'm sitting close-by or because I have a monopoly on some topic of discussion.  

Recently, I've been wondering about what it means to be a real person.  What differentiates me from a story-book character?  I don't feel valued as a person, but as some caricature of an intellectual.  I feel like real people have a more diverse set of inner properties, a more varied range of interests, a stronger capacity for emotion.

For all intents and purposes, my peers treat everything I do as some type of wizardry, as if I just have an innate ability to carry out my hobbies.  Whenever I try to explain what I'm doing to someone else, I feel like they just dismiss it as too complicated to fathom, no matter how simple the concepts really are.  Nobody is really interested in anything I do.  It's as if they just think ""Oh, he's sbot_crafter, of course he's doing that."" and pay no more attention.  I often begin excitedly describing my current projects, then cut off as I realize nobody cares.  Ever since I can remember, I've always wanted to find someone willing to work with me on something.

Besides friends, I don't feel like I have the capacity for any deeper companionship.  I daydream about being romantically close to someone.  I don't mean sex; I quite honestly couldn't care less about that.  I just feel like I can't share my innermost feelings with anybody.  Sometimes, I just need a hug, and I don't know anyone who'd really want to do that.  Nobody's interested in getting closer to me, and I really don't know what I'd actually *do* with someone who was.  I can't just turn some poor girl into a plush toy.  We'd need to have something to do together, a common goal or topic of discussion, a mechanism to be around each other, and I just don't know what that'd be.  I have hobbies, but they don't really lend themselves to company.  Besides, I have yet to feel attraction towards any woman in particular, so I don't even know who I'd ideally want to be with, or even if it is appropriate for me to be with anyone in the first place.

To top it all off, I'm in limbo.  I'll be finishing high school soon, and going off to college.  Any friends I have and any progress I make will be gone come Spring time.  Even if I found a girlfriend, she'd probably end up going somewhere else for school.  I shouldn't bother forging deeper relationships, because they'll realistically only last a few months before we're driven apart.  I'm not good at communicating with people over the Internet, as much as I like computers.

I don't know why I wrote this.  I feel trapped in my own head.",29Nov2017,1
29,"        I’ve struggled with this kind of problem since the beginning of high school. Feeling lazy, unmotivated, and indifferent even though I am a naturally ambitious and outgoing person. Right now I’m a first year college student and I’m trying to finish my first semester with decent grades but I have become increasingly disinterested in my classes and work. I’m fully capable of doing well but I make decisions that ultimately make everything harder for myself. It’s gotten to the point this semester where I feel incapable of fixing things. 
         For one specific class we were assigned a 6 page research paper with an annotated Bibliography and a video presentation. There have been multiple due dates the past few weeks for the annotated bibliography, 2 rough drafts of the paper, and the video presentation. I have absolutely nothing. The final paper is due in one week and if I don’t do it I will most definitely fail the class. This is extremely stressful because there is a lot of pressure from people close to me to do well and not to disappoint them.
          My whole life I’ve known that I deal with emotional disorders did despite obvious signs of depression and anxiety, I have never been clinically diagnosed as depressed or anxious nor have I ever spoken to a doctor about it. My first instinct is to blame my parents because I felt they never really took me seriously when I told them I might be depressed. Of course they were concerned but they assumed it wasn’t serious and I didn’t want to be a burden or cause any disruption. I know that the obvious thing to do would be to talk to a doctor or specialist but I can’t bring myself to put effort into it.
         So of course I know that depression/anxiety play a role in the whole schpeel I just don’t know where to go from here. I think sometimes I tend to blame myself for my inability to do things therefore I don’t deem myself worthy of fixing it. I also am curious why I only have a hard time when it comes to school work and work that is very time consuming or complicated. It’s like I immediately have my mind set that the task is impossible so I never even try despite the fact that there are consequences that I dread. I will stress out for day after day and even dream about it but never do anything to help myself. Why can’t I just do what I need to do???
         

I think it’s pretty obvious I know what’s happening to me here, I just needed a place to piece it all together and hopefully get feedback.",29Nov2017,2

So my girlfriend of 4 months has been telling me now and then that I’m a real choleric, because sometimes I go from calm to angry in a blink of a moment. For example she jokingly provocatively says “..and he was reaaally handsome..” just to get a kick out of me and I jokingly grab her by the neck and jump on her and playfully bite her or something, she starts screaming, I get off her, we both laugh and she says I’m a choleric.

So I never really took her seriously because I only do it as a joke right, but recently something happened to me and I’ve been wondering if she’s right.

So a while back a friend of me told me to go to jump park with him and other fellas from 7 to 8 pm. I told him that sorry I can’t, as I have school from 6.15 to 7.45 pm. He goes like “ :( “ and it’s done. 

Later it’s around 6.45, I have my english class, we’re discussing something with the teacher and suddenly I see an incoming call from my friend, I got my iphone on mute so it’s no big deal whatsoever, noone can hear. But suddenly I start feeling this huge amount of rage getting in my head, like “why the FUCK you calling me when I clearly said I’m at school”. 

But a couple seconds later I realize he would probably just really like me to be there, and he’s likely calling just to see if anything’s changed. Now it’s important to say that I know my friend to be kind of ignorant to other people’s plans, like tuesday I tell him three times I’m spending weekend with my girlfriend, wednesday he asks me what I’m doing on weekend and on friday evening he gets mad for me not being in the pub with him and others because he’s long forgotten I even have a girlfriend haha.

But like I realize it’s kinda nice from him to want me to be there, I just send text saying I can’t go and I’m calm and nice again. But still, these instant rages are kind of scaring me.

I don’t wanna be like that. I am usually nice to people, but this just sometimes happens to me and I don’t like it. How do I change myself?

I would like to support inclusionism, if possible, but other than that, I have no strong opinions, and I'm not much familiar in the process, as this is my first election.

43,"I find myself questioning God and of late, being deep in depression, its been tough. Aside from all the bullshit I'm facing, business is at a make or break, and it looks like it could go well, I finally decided to absolutely stop seeing my ex when she just wanted to hang out, despite being in love with her, but knowing it wasn't going anywhere, though she does cross my mind all the time, but, I'm moving on. I had gotten to the part where I stopped talking to an imaginary her and even stopped thinking about her or how she had been. I archived our messages, put them far away, and even started flirting with new people, though nothing serious. Today, at a random work meeting in a random part of town, I run into her doppelganger, and everything came to a halt. I couldn't help looking at her and she got slightly uncomfortable, but I explained to her, and we had a good laugh, and she let it slide, and I walked away. And by doppelganger, I mean a fucking carbon copy, right down to her personality. I totally freaked out. So we had a good laugh with my ex, she explained she was moving away and it was tough for her cause her business failed and she wanted a clean break and didn't want to stay and couldn't ask me to leave, so she thought it was a good idea to call it a day. I respect that. I'm emigrating anyway, and we are heading in two totally different directions. But, now, I am mind fucked. Emotions everywhere. And I'm asking why? ",29Nov2017,2

47,"I'm in no mood to write a hour long history of what happened so I'm going to (try) keep it short.

There was a convention that school forced you to go to. This convention was a place for getting information about applying for different universities and such.

Either way, even though it was necessary to go there because my school said it was mandatory, I went alone. Not because I wanted to, but because that's how it was planned? (Who makes a trip to a convention mandatory without going as a group?). All went well untill I went to the check-in.

This convention entrence fee is done through your phone. I didn't own a phone so I decided to ask the assistant clerk for help. There was a line for the help. I was in line waiting patiently, quiet if I may add. And that is when it happens.

Someone did the usuall booty grab/smack thingy.

Now, this was very unusual for me. I stayed still in shock because I did not expect this to happen at all, and it have never happened before earlier in my life (ok ,well, sort of, but not in a situation like this). This also means I did not see the person who did it. 

A long day passes, I get home and I am now writing this. I really don't know my feelings because currently they are so complicated. However, I haven't told anyone about this since that would only objectify me further for being a victim - which I don't like. Further more, I am male so I have no chance in trial if I ever were to find this person, so it's kinda pointless. 

I do however have the need to share to people that won't continue to know me as a victim - hence this post.

Thanks for reading - from a very confused male in his early years.",29Nov2017,5

Also, I just get reallyyy uncomfortable having physical contact (hugs) with members of my family. I don’t have any male friends because I just don’t get them. I don’t know what to talk about and I don’t find we have very much in common. It’s not a huge problem because I’m in a relationship with a girl but I wanna know what’s wrong with me. Plus I think women and men are the same and I don’t think I should see such a huge difference between them. Anyone knows what’s my problem?

53,"After going to our first festival in 2016 we instantly fell in love. How could you not? The ambiance was something we had never felt before. The concerts were not like any concerts we had ever been to. Making friends with everyone in the crowd. There is nothing like being at a music festival. We miss that feeling. So we're going to them all, and you are all invited along.
We will be hitting 16 music festivals in 16 weeks. Driving across the country going from one to the other. Will be posting our adventures on our Instagram page (@trippinonmusic), Snapchat (@trippinonmusic), and Youtube (@trippinonmusic).
Our goal is to gain as big of a following as we can before we set out on our journey. That way we can organize meetups to hang out at the campsites, go into the festivals to rave, and whatever else we can come up with.
So if this sounds like something you might be interested in, then please give our accounts a follow! We would hate for you guys to miss out on any of the shenanigans we get into!
Any comments you have that would make this idea better please let us know!! We are not afraid of constructive criticism:)
See you guys this summer!!

P.S. if you have any crazy pictures or videos from any festivals, raves, or from your campgrounds please DM us on our instagram for a shoutout! We would love to see/post your crazy shit!!

56,"I have a philosophy essay I have to write where one of the questions has me talk about self and how to live according to the individual's view of a ""virtue full life."" It really made me think, and I often find myself daydreaming constantly of outside worlds, often with distinct tropes such as endless libraries, fountains, glass domes, certain and specific shades of white, blue and green. A slight biblical undertone is present as well. I have dreams and some unknown longing for these places, and I find myself roaming aimlessly when I think about them. When I do, I find myself lost and outside the world we live in today. Usually, it leads me feeling devastated and distraught that the world is and never will be this odd place in my head. I don't have any idea where it comes from. I recently found the short story ""The Library of Babel"" and I cry a lot when I read it because it describes my situation. 

As for the question, I would like to ask if anybody has these sort of thoughts or feelings. I feel, when I delve into these sorts of things, very very secluded and distant from everything around me, as if it was a blur, and I find myself longing for the specific place that exists in my head.

58,"The fact is, I'm really pumped about a paper I just wrote but I can't really tell the people I work with the main reason why I'm so pumped because it comes across as bragging. I'm a graduate student and I just finished my quals (a big paper designed to sort of set up your dissertation). You can't get any help on content and people really, *really* struggle with it. That's why I can't say anything. People turn it in moments before the deadline and I'm done like a week early. 

Most people write drafts and drafts but I don't. My writing style is unique; I write a single draft and then edit it after waiting a day. I don't do multiple edits because they aren't needed. I outline very heavily (going as far as identifying the theme of each paragraph) so that when I write, the entire narrative falls into place and the need for editing is minimal. 

You can have friends read your paper to point out areas where the paper is weak or doesn't make sense, so I've sent it out for clarity feedback. The responses so far have been very good but I'm still waiting on two more people. Anyway, I'm just really excited that the paper turned out so well. I've been collaborating on papers for so many years now that I forgot how good it felt to put an entire paper together following the layout you personally set. It's really a unique and wonderful feeling. I should probably go take a nap now.  ",29Nov2017,13
61,"I worked with this woman for two years, sitting across a desk from her the whole time. For 18 months of those two years she treated me like shit in ways only someone who has worked in corporate will understand. I took it the whole time because I thought that's what  juniors do. She didn't  start to actually appreciate me until a few months ago. I hated her guts for a really long time, I didn't know how to deal with that kind of disrespect, I had come from a blue collar background and things are handled much differently in those jobs.

My last day is in a couple weeks, today was her last day before she leaves on vacation and i'll probably never see her again. Near the end of the day, I waited until she went to the washroom and just packed up my shit and split.
