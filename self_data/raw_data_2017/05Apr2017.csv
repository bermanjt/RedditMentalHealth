11,"So i'm 16 years old, sophomore in high school, and never really did any of the typical teenage troublemaker stuff you hear about.

I'm pretty awkward socially so i've never had too many friends. But one of my friends decided to drag me to this thing at his school (He goes to a private school and i don't know anybody there except him) this afternoon. After it was over, him and like 5 of his friends (Who were complete strangers to me) decided to just walk around downtown and chill. I tagged along and ended up getting to know them all.

Well about an hour and a half in, my friend's mom made him come home. Instead of just going home when he left like i normally wouldve, i decided to stay behind and hang with his friends. That was a huge step for me, and i was scared shitless when i saw him leave. 

But it was alright and i feel like i'm in their group now.

14,"Hi there,

And thank you for stopping by. I have a HUGE question, that I haven't been able to find the answer to for years. I want to be famous, more than anything, more than I could have ever imagined. And I need to know how to get there. I will get there, i know it, but I just need a little guidance. 

It started in college two years ago after I won a ""Hottest Man"" competition the school had. We had a talent portion, question and answer, bathing suit, the whole 9 yards. Long story short is that I won, and I loved the recognition for weeks after that. It was awesome. I started doing small skits and plays with some of my friends and ever since loved being the head of attention no matter what. I just love being recognized. 

I graduated with a finance degree, and I'm currently getting my MBA, and have a great paying job, but it's just not what I want to be doing. I'm doing it because I'm just in the routine like every other person. But I KNOW, that I'm destine to make it big in entertainment. I just need that one breakout audition. 

So now I'm asking, should I just drop everything I have, move out to California, possibly work in a coffee shop to make money to live off of and just go door to door until I find something? Do I pay for an agent to find me auditions? Do I continue to use Backstage, a site that has seemingly got me no where? I just need to know what to do. I need a counselor or someone to help me get my foot in the door. If you're out there, PLEASE message me. 

I've been told my most relatable actor that I will likely be similar to is Jim Carey. To me, it's the best compliment that I have gotten now a couple of times. I want to continue to be a positive influence on everyone's life!

16,"Hi there, I've been having this recurring perspective problem and was wondering if anyone has experienced this dilemma before.

So to preface my situation, I'm a student in college with 2 physics tests coming up next Wednesday and Thursday. At the moment I'm finishing up homework for one of my physics classes and was thinking to myself, ""Maybe I'll grab a coffee so I can stay up and finish my math homework due this Thursday."" But as soon as I thought this, I remembered that I didn't do as well as I planned when I drank lots of coffee to study for my physics tests 2 weeks ago. I instantly thought ""If I do get coffee anytime before my tests next week, I'll get similar scores as how I did last time.""

I guess I would say I'm a pretty ritual based person and this mindset, in my opinion, could affect how I feel going into the test after remembering that I did end up getting coffee. Am I completely off and overthinking what's going on in my head? If anyone shares similar thought processes I'm curious on how you would deal with this. Thank you!",05Apr2017,2

However this is justified since we would be going to Ohio and it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me.

Marching band to me was something I regret not doing for the past two years. Only now have I realized that marching band may be the key to solve some of my internal problems and make my high school life much more lively. I'm going to be on the drumline, bass specifically. For winter percussion I'll be doing the same thing. I'm really passionate about music and I'm going to do the impossible and try to major in it, so for now doing marching band and winter percussion would be a nice start for my music-filled life.

My older sister manipulated me into doing her schoolwork and helping her with rent and groceries while she was in college and I was in high school. I had to work so hard while she partied and had fun.
My peers manipulated me into tutoring for free for hundreds of hours. I stopped going to school but they'd still insist I help them. I needed to help myself though. But how could I say no?
Men manipulated me into pleasing them, even when I was too little to understand what was going on. Why would you want anything from a kid? Really, why? What's the appeal of a girl who is repulsed by you? 
I came to Reddit because the real world is a little too real. I tried to talk to people my own age but they never reply. Are they even here? 
I thought I made a friend even though we're very different, and he's much older than me. He pried me open, learned so much about me and everything I do and everything that's been done to me, all over the course of months, some of the toughest in my life, and he said I was brave and strong. I told him everything. I trusted him. 
He asked for my pictures. He insisted saying he wanted to know me better. He wanted to show me his artwork. His nude ""artwork."" It's not art. You're a married man in your 40's trying to get off by sending lewd photos to a young girl. I'm not stupid. Neither are you. That's why you deleted your account, isn't it?

I don't want to be alone but I don't want to be with these people either. I am afraid of the world. People are ravenous and will take what they want and there's nothing you can do.

Because of all this work and commitment, opportunities have found their way to me. I'm not really worried about finding work outside of college because I have something lined up.

38,"I've been on reddit two years now, and in my time here, I've seen people mention SRS more than a few times, usually with disdain (rightfully so, I would later learn). But while I always knew what that sub was about in some capacity, I never really delved deeper into it. Didn't have much reason to.

Then when the whole debacle with /r/punchablefaces happened, and I learnt that the takeover was a coordinated attack by SRS mods/users, my interest was piqued. SRS, which I had all the while assumed was just the subreddit equivalent of 'that annoying kid that nobody likes', was apparently quite a capable force. I remember being caught up in the drama for awhile and even visiting the SRS subreddit to see what the fuck these guys were all about, but I didn't really find any incriminating evidence (the subreddit seems normal enough on the surface, little did I know about the shady stuff that went on behind closed doors), and of course after a day or so I completely forgot about it.

Fast forward to yesterday. I honestly don't remember how I went down that rabbit hole but I was just reading through some old reddit threads and the next thing I knew, I found myself reading about Arian Chen (read: Grade A asshole)'s exposé on VA. Wanting to find out more about this piece of reddit history previously unknown to me, I went digging for more information until I eventually found myself on /r/MuseumOfReddit - on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/1hzra9/doxgate_the_closing_of_rcreepshots_and_the/). (Shoutout to museum curator /u/UnholyDemigod - keep up the good work!)

It was then that I found out about SRS's involvement and just how shady they actually were. In light of this newfound knowledge I visited their sub once again and actually spent a good chunk of time looking through their posts and the posts on their network of affiliated subreddits. It's almost eerie how this seemingly innocent (albeit obviously retarded) front could be hiding so many ugly things. I mean, I always knew they were notorious for vote brigading - but doxxing, blackmail, planting 'agents' into other subreddits to monitor their 'enemies'? Had I not seen the evidence, I would be none the wiser.

This has been a very eye-opening experience, and yet at the same time, a very bewildering one. Despite all this evidence that these people legitimately believe in the cause they are 'fighting' for, and go to great lengths to achieve what they want, a part of me still can't shake off the idea that perhaps they are just a bunch of very dedicated trolls, and that their sub is just one big joke that the rest of reddit isn't in on. If you look at their sub, these people almost seem like a parody of themselves. I mean, the Fempire? Really? And the reason I initially dismissed them as trolls in the first place back when the /r/punchablefaces fiasco hapened was because they turned the place into a minion sub. That seems more like something a bunch of griefers from 4chan would do than what a radical internet SJW cult would do. I'd be glad if someone could shed more light on this.

Also, how the hell haven't they been banned yet? I've heard the whole 'vote manipulation can't be proven' thing before, but troll or no troll, there's hard evidence that they've blackmailed, harassed, and threatened other users (in the form of screenshots) - and I'm pretty damn sure those are bannable (illegal, even) offences.

All in all, a very bewildering revelation and I'm still recovering from browsing too much SRS.",05Apr2017,5

I'm ready to stop feeling like I'm 14 when I'm almost 40. As much as it's cute when my daughter gets spoiled by her grandparents, it's at a point where she expects it. I have many thanks for the help we have received. It's still been difficult to try to fit into the 14 year old mold my parents still expect of me after living so long outside of their home. 

This is good timing as I'm out of ways to explain to my parents why (allowing something I have been clear shouldn't be allowed and I am Mom) is not helping anybody. Telling me that it's my decision as a parent and then showing her that it's okay to disobey me does nobody any good.

She was never supposed to expect that every bag we brought into the house was something for her. My Mom used to buy her things constantly, but has gotten better.

I'm appreciative! I really am. Maybe this was their way of trying to keep me from being too comfortable here. As if feeling like I'm a 14 year old living in my brother's old room which is also my Dad's office area is going to be okay long term.",05Apr2017,2
