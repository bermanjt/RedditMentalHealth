0,Since I was 4 I've always had dogs growing up. I live close to my mom who has a dog I love but I really miss having an animal for myself. My bf and I are moving into a new place in a month that allows cats and I miss so much having an animal to come home to and take care of that I want to adopt one from my local shelter. Bf says cats are too expensive and doesn't think this year will be the year we get one. Maybe next year.,09Apr2017,1
2,"I try really hard to follow through on my commitments to myself such as finishing a book or a little whittling project or setting a goal in a video game but I just can't seem to ever complete anything. I'm feeling like I'm taking on too many little projects at once and need to focus on just a few, but then I get burnt out. 

Starting to feel like I'm developing some sort of complex that I *can't* finish anything. 

The thing is, I get to certain goals and feel a little joy but the effort I put in seems tremendous. 

I'm asking for any tips or encouragements, feeling pretty low about this and would love some insight so I can actually start making myself a better person ",09Apr2017,4
3,"I just graduated from college last year, and in leaving the world of academia, I now work retail. Since then I left my stable girlfriend of 3 years to pursue useless tinder dates, drug riddled nights and hungover mornings. I went off my meds for bipolar, lived generally a stable life, but a life built around looking for another job and drinking. I tried to grasp at a meaningful relationship recently. (I'll call her T) T reminded me so much of my ex that I felt comfortable and at home with her. But I realized she was not her, and that I cannot resurrect what I lost. My ex is now with another man who my friends tell me just like my, but is a better fit for her. I hope he is. I hope he treats her kinder and is more patient than I ever was. T broke up with me three weeks ago, and since then it has just been a blur. I no longer find joy at my job where we both work, but she is my supervisor. I fortunately haven't been scheduled with her in a while now, and we are professional at work as we don't want to bring suspicion onto ourselves, but it kills me even more that it feels like it never happened. My life is now run by two lines of code that make my schedule. Kronos is a bad system. I can't plan around a randomly generated schedule. I really want to quit, but then my parents tell me how I need to tough my way through this so I can show I'm resilient to potential employers, and that quiting is a problem with my generation. I look at who I am now- struggling with a secret addiction to Vicodin (I am able to get off, but occasionally I become weak and take a few for a day or so), I smoke weed now, and I hide that from my parents, I'm heart broken, and I see no light to the end of this job hunt. I feel so hopeless. I used to write music, I used to be funny and go do stand up comedy, I used to be smart and talk to teachers. Now I have become resigned to a mental death. I just don't care about myself anymore.",09Apr2017,8
4,"My personal inner diatribe these days have centered around some recursive thoughts and I am frustrated by it. I'm not looking for solutions. Someone reading this who might enjoy it by relating is really all I'm hoping for. Maybe knowing others feel like a garbage-can will make you feel a little less... that. Schadenfreude?

My Brain:
There is so much good in the world. There's so many things to be grateful for. And there is so much shittyness. My life falls somewhere in the middle and I feel so selfish for caring about how I feel when in just one walk outside I can see 20 people who have it way worse than I do. I'm not sure how to be happy sometimes. I find it especially difficult when I compare my life to those around me. What they have and what I do not, material yes, but mostly otherwise. I find it crazy how quick I can go from feeling intelligent, whole, and well balanced - to feeling like a huge idiot, empty, and thinking in circles like a psychopath. Usually- I'm able to be the rock someone might need to push off of in their own storm, I can take your bad news, look you in the eye and say with certainty, you will get through this. You will survive. You will find joy again... And sometimes I feel like a 10 year old boy who's lost in the mall. Like I'm stuck in an insurmountable problem, because I'm just not smart enough to solve it. I don't like feeling stupid, it is the 'anti-state' of my desired state of mind.

I'm so grateful for the opportunities that are in front of me and for the ones that have gotten me to where I am today. I take each and every one of them and pursue them. They make me happier than anything else. Working and creating is the best therapy to an idle mind I have found. And an idle mind thinks in circles, often around the things you really shouldn't dwell on. Career, friends, and relationships are all fluid, and opportunities and people will come and go from your life. People who have come into and gone from my life have each taught me invaluable things about myself while they were around, and to deal with their absence is also a lesson well learned, and always worth learning again. To give some context, I have seen people off and on throughout my whole life, but (for the most part) I consider myself having been single for the past 5 years or so as that has been by far the norm and not the exception. It's tough for me to find what I want in someone, and my philosophy has always been that it's better to be single, than to be unhappy but together. Boy can that suck at times though. Most recently I was reminded of this by a girl who I told how I feel, who told me how she felt, it seemed that they were the same... it was amazing, and it lasted less than a week. Then she let her baggage get in the way, and she turned tail. I have so infrequently found what I like in someone, it has been tough to forget her, but I'm trying to as per her obvious wishes. What makes me go crazy is how short everything with this person was. Literally under a week, and I have been dealing with the consequences for over two months now. What the fuck is wrong with me.

I'm 28 and I hope I have a lot of life ahead of me. I don't think I've wasted the time it's taken to get here, but have I? My parents would have been married and 3 years into owning a home together by now. So where does that leave me? Who's to judge if i've wasted what time I have besides myself, and if I don't immediately know the answer, could the answer be yes? Can anyone just *be* happy? Or is 50:50 the best you could hope for. When does 'not feeling bad', become synonymous with just not feeling.. ugh. You know, I'm actually a pretty happy guy most of the time. You wouldn't know it from the this post, but I promise it's true!...I don't like being unhappy. It is the anti-state to my desired state of mind... Uh. The other anti-state.. The quantum anti-state? It doesn't matter.

There are a lot of things going on in my brain and I think the static noise of them without hint they'll change makes me ultimately feel trapped. 

So. 

Hm. Hmm. Hmmmm. What to do? I'm not a 10 year old boy lost in a mall, and I believe that if you want to change how you feel, you can. You are never trapped and you are never helpless. 

I've attacked my life in a bunch of different ways, but the thing I value most is that I've taken to walking up to the top of the stairs at [Casa Loma](http://tdcanada.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Casa_Loma_Wedding_Engagement.jpg) (a place in Toronto), sitting there for awhile and [looking all the way down Spadina to college](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iDvETWznQ1w/VViXLGxMnAI/AAAAAAAAB0A/5jNvRBwpqwg/s1600/cl10.JPG). That's about 20 blocks of unobstructed view, inside a heavily populated city. It's actually quite astonishing. For such a small investment of a 15 minute walk (for me), you really get quite the sight. The light shines off the buildings quite beautifully in the afternoon. The morning is crisp and windy with heat on your face. The night has beautiful lights and a different sound from all the little creatures that woke up and none of the cars to drown them out.

In the day is when I enjoy it most, just watching the cars pull up, turn and go about their lives. To see the city skyline and be reminded that every window you see someone is behind at some point. That there are 3 more sides to that building you cannot see. And that there are more buildings behind those buildings! That these buildings were created not by accident but by deliberate planning, and the ingenuity and determination of people. What is it, that separates the people who build sky scrapers, and the people who can't afford to feed themselves. What separates me from either? I don't have these answers, I think it's just important to ask the question. For anyone annoyed with my hoity-toity philosophical train of thought, take solace in knowing I'm a huge nerd who takes a lot of his inspiration from movies, mostly, the matrix. Anyways I digress... 

When I go on these walks, I am reminded of these lives, these many, millions of other lives, most of whom I could never interact with, these lives that aren't anything like my own, and to glimpse the problems others deal with. The absolute enormity of building a mega structure; calculating that cost and knowing, KNOWING, that your mistakes would end lives. And, in seeing the raw struggle of those without the ability to pay for groceries. It is all part of the spectrum of life unfortunately. I sit there looking out at the city and for a few minutes a day, I can visualize the scope of my life a little better. I'm a tiny spec of dust in an endless earth, with endless space around me. I am not trapped. I'm thankful for the smallness of my troubles. I matter so little to the universe but I get the massive joy of being able to exist within it. Things truly are relative. It has helped me to be reminded of this frequently.

Do you know that things will get better for yourself? No, they could stay the same, and they could get worse. But in some ways, that's an incredible privilege. I try to be as grateful as I can be for the low points in my life, as they are the only things that give context to what can make you happy.

Thank you for punching me in the face sometimes universe. It has made me stronger. But.. please punch me less hard next time.",09Apr2017,9

9,"I'm a 17 year old dude, junior in high school. All I do on a daily basis is wake up early as fuck, drive to school with music on in the car, sit through classes and act happy, self-deprecating (in a humorous way), or goofy all of the time to fit in and numb the pain I feel, then go to practice after school and run 50 miles a week, up home, do homework, feel horrible about myself, lose sleep to fucking around, feel horrible about myself again, rinse and repeat. On the weekends all I do is stay home, in my bed, and do nothing and wait for the cycle of horrible things to start again. I feel purposeless and like I'm not normal in a bad way ... okay now I don't want to write some long ass post eloquently explaining myself or my situation. So here's caveman talk. 

Fuck it I'm too depressed here's what words first pop into my mind when I think about myself and/or what's wrong with me:

Introverted, involvement, somehow lazy and motivated at the same time, no relationship, seeking validation, seeking empathy, seeking activity yet too scared to engage in any of it because social anxiety, massive FOMO, no confidence or self-esteem, skinny arms, fucked up humor, unrelatable, awkward/quiet, too nice of a guy, can't socialize, want to express my teenage angst in a socially acceptable and relatable way, want an escape from all of this, I feel like everyone is out to get me, there's something wrong with me, I'm treated like a kid and expected to act like an adult, but I want to get out and be the best I can and be the most adept I can.

None of this seems to work out for me. Maybe I need to be more dynamic, but how? 

Edit: I should also mention I'm going to a therapist for anxiety and depression. Recently told my peers I could be suicidal and I guess my behavior plus that information was enough to get me sent to a shrink.",09Apr2017,6
11,"Hey guys. My boyfriend is here in America for school, but he's originally from Honduras. His parents got really mad at him a couple days ago, and they threatened to keep him at home after summer vacation and end his college career. If he doesn't come back to school, I'll have no way to see him. I mean, I'd be ok with trying long distance, but it's just.... I don't know that we'd be able to make it work. It would hurt too much.  He'd be gone. It would be years before he'd be able to be an independent adult, and even then.... there's just no guarantee we would EVER be able to physically be together again. 
But the worst part is that we don't know for sure yet. We can't start dealing with him leaving permanently because we don't know for sure that he is. I pray that he will be allowed to come back to school, but I'm so scared he won't. ",09Apr2017,5
13,"Drinking last night, I decided it was a good idea to hop on amazon. Ever since I read that neighbors from hell story, I was kind of interested in an electronic drum set. I'm not at all musically inclined, but what the hell - so I found a cheapish drum set on amazon, and added it to my cart. Without realizing the complete impulsiveness of this purchase, but with the rationality of a drunk person, I realized I can't play an electronic drum kit - I need a drum stool! And drum sticks! So I went ahead and added them to my cart, and checked out.

This morning I woke up and the first thought in my head was ""Holy shit, I feel awful"" followed very closely with ""Holy shit, I don't want drums!""

Quickly open my laptop, 3% charge, that's fine, that's all I need to cancel this order, I'm still on the amazon page so I rush to your orders and click cancel...they might not be able to cancel my order. Okay, that's what I have to live with, it was my fault for being an idiot, maybe I get drums, what if I'm a natural? What if I found my real calling?

I get an email from amazon that my item has been succesfully cancelled. Okay, great. I knew I wouldn't play the drums after a week anyway, this is for the best. I click the email...they were only able to cancel the actual drum kit.

So I've got a drum stool and some drumsticks coming my way. Cool. I'm open to suggestions on what the hell to use them for.",09Apr2017,28
14,"Bernie and Bill were talking about climate change. How the same people that were hired by the tobacco companies to deny tobacco had negative effects on health have also been hired by climate change deniers to rebuff claims that the climate is changing. 

Freaked me out. 

Then they started talking about how this is going to impact all of the cities along the coast lines. Infrastructure will be greatly affected, abandoned etc. 

Then they started talking about third world and developing countries being affected. Storms, flooding, drought. Real end of the world kinda shit. 

For a trying to be socialist/liberal/progressive guy like me it's really scary. 

Then I started thinking about when I was a kid. 

I was raised in church. Right around the time Ronald Reagan was President. The Republicans and the Religious leaders United and formed ""the silent majority"".  

I remember growing up Southern Baptist, then Full Gospel, then Assembly of God, then Non-Denominational, then I left and went Berean. 

God/Jesus had always been a huge influence on my life and world view. 

Unfortunately those views were mixed with politics. 
I equated political figures and what they said as things that were best because they must be Christian too. 

I've wised up. 

These days my parents store barrels of rice, hoard precious metals, hunting gear, store water, they are as prepared as Mormons on their best days. 

They seek the trials and tribulations that the book of Revelations talks about. 

They WANT what Bernie and Bill are talking about to come true. 
They WANT the storms, drought, world famine, and apocalypse to happen to prove that The End Times described by the Christian bible is true. 

They won't vote to make the world a better place.  They *want* the world to collapse. They want ""the world"" to bring about the end of the world so that they can see the return of Jesus, the Messiah. 

This is what science in the United States has to contend with. These are the people that voted for Trump. Not because he ran as a Republican,  it was because he would hasten the end of the fucking world!

I tried to do that to him but he wouldn't let me. We met because I had just ghosted someone else and was looking for a distraction. I told him I ghost people one day after we'd known each other a week. He made me promise I wouldn't do that to him. I said the words and I meant it. Fast forward three weeks and he pissed me off by what felt like he was ignoring me (yeah, I get the joke) and I removed him from my contacts and was not going to talk to him again.  Then I immediately went out and found a distraction. (He and I were not exclusive because of distance, so that part is not a problem.)


I could see he contacted me and eventually I responded. He said he assumed he wouldn't hear back from me and that I'd ghosted him. I admitted I did. Then he wanted to talk about us and feelings. Which I hate talking about. To the point I couldn't cum when we played afterwards because I was too fucked up from talking. 


I'm not good with feelings. Girls are supposed to want to talk about feelings but not me. I squirm inside. I don't like being vulnerable. I don't want to open up. I don't want to fall in love with him. There I said it. I don't want to fall in love with him. He lives in another state. He is 12 years younger (yeah, I got it like that). But I like how we are.

Apparently he bought tickets this past week and didn't remember to tell me he was going. I understand that he wanted to go somewhere, and he wanted to do it immediately because he's really tired with work, but I can't help crying about it.

This morning I told him to 'have fun', because I didn't have the energy to come up with an argument about why the situation would be upsetting. I fear it's too late to make any sign that I'm upset, and I don't want to come across as petty. Should I be mad, and what should I do?

Edit: I'm getting a lot of questions about who this girl is. She's his close friend from college, and I don't suspect cheating. It's just a trust thing in telling people about situations that could be misunderstood.

I want to be able to go to a store and pick out anything and be able to wear it instead of digging through the back, looking for that one XL. Tired of being at korea and asking the store owner if they have XYZ in the largest size. Going through online stores to see that their plus sizes are out of stock or stupidly expensive.

There's loose confidence, sometimes I have it, sometimes I don't. But if I can stand tall without feeling the need to cover my tummy, maybe it'll help. 

Maybe I have harsher eyes on myself, but I am definitely not banging.

I can't sleep at all until I pass out from exhaustion, but even then I wake up from a nightmare about nuclear war.

And it's not just that either. If it did happen, then I'm scared to die, because I don't know if there's an afterlife, or a heaven or a hell or nothing. I'm scared of nothingness, I'm not sure if there is a heaven, and I'm scared to go to hell. I'm scared of dying because I'm scared it'll hurt.

I'm scared of losing my SO. I've been with her for 9 years, and I don't ever want to lose her.

The great thing is that, for the first time since November, the weather isn't just tolerable, but actually nice. The sun was close to setting, there was an occasional breeze, but it wasn't warm or cold out. About as neutral as it gets. We sat down at a picnic table and did our own things. He was saying all this shit that's relevatory and profound to him but regular stoner shit to me. He was thinking real hard about his ex and whether or not jealousy drives him to party like he does. Me, I'm laying back and listening to the birds sing to each other, admiring the color of the setting sun's beams, and pondering how nice it'd be to have my own moonshine still.

After a short while, we did a walk around and laid down on some stone benches and just watched the trees. It was so relaxed, something you don't really appreciate when you're a cub scout running around playing tag. I've known for some years why dads have always agreed to take their little snot noses outside, but I get overwhelmed every spring. It's brand new every time. The birds play a little song, a dog might bark in the neighborhood, a car will wisp past. The leaves come back, the grass reminds me of the Shire of all things. All of that is worth it, even if your lil' cuz doesn't appreciate the smell of the grass. I wanted to pop a beer and, if the birds had stopped, play some Mac DeMarco.

I don't know how other people relax, but I sit down and enjoy the sleepy pace of spring. Worry about work on Sunday.

I've been reading a lot of self-help and business books recently and they all have one thing in common: the people you hang out with influence you in more ways than you realize. They call the people you hang out with who are unsupportive or negative toxic people and all of them agree to cut out the toxic people to improve your quality of life or productivity. You're supposed to look for the 20% of people who cause your 80% of problems stress (using the Pareto principle). The problem with this is my mother is in that 20%. I won't have a problem distancing myself from a few ""friends"" but my mom is definitely one of those people. It's not like she's a bad parent, she really cares and wants me to take the safe route for everything and get a stable job with a master's degree and I don't think that's for me. She's similar to the poor dad from ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"", except I don't have a Rich Dad to counter her negativity. I'm not meant to travel the safe route and every time I do something to pursue my dreams of being financially free and self-employed, she shoots it down and tells me I need to get better grades in school and start doing internships. The reality is I'm pretty sure I want to be a full time entertainer, and I can reach financial freedom by investing my money properly and working smarter. What are your thoughts on this?",09Apr2017,2
33,"So I will keep it short. I am introverted and more often than not depressed for long periods of time. Last year around December, I hit the bottom again, and it was almost impossible to climb out. I had a few days off work, so I did not have to worry about appearances then, but soon I had to join work. And when I did it was bad. I wanted to function normally at least while at work. And so I began putting up appearances of being a jovial, extroverted person - polar opposite of what I was feeling then. I started talking with girls in the office, with whom I had not spoken a word in a year. I tried humour, mostly self-deprecating. And guess what, with acting deeply I actually felt like another person. But it was exhausting. Also my attempt at humour sometimes boomeranged - either I inadvertently hurt someone or I lost self-respect. It got so bad after a while that I had to stop speaking again, because I no longer knew how to act anymore - what to say, what not to say. But it did made me partly functional. Now I am not as bad as I was, but I can no longer act a lot as well. In the last few days, I have gone numb and been really trying hard to cry, but could not. I finally did some time back, and so I began writing this.

Next thing that I remember is seeing the cop driving off. I have no clue what he told me or why he let me go. I'm fairly certain that my speech was slurred. I'm not even sure if I showed him my ID. I should've went to jail last night. I could've killed someone. 

I'm going to take a break from alcohol for a while. And I'm never driving after having any amount of alcohol ever again. I'm not sure why my friends let me drive in that kind of condition. 

Work has been stressing me out and I've been feeling quite lonely. I've fallen back on using alcohol to distract me from my problems. That doesn't at all excuse what I did, that's just why it happened. I really need to straighten up my life. ",09Apr2017,75
37,"That's about it. 

I am an introvert (and I like nerdy things such as video games and sci-fi), but I'm not a shy person by any means. I have plenty of friends that care about me (I think) and I meet a lot of people, since I go to university. I don't think that I'm ugly, I'd give myself an 8/10, I keep getting compliments on my blue eyes or my hair from my close female friends, but literally no one I met showed any desire of dating me. If I had to nitpick, I suppose I don't look very manly since I can't really grow a full beard and I'm fairly skinny, but I don't think this should be such a huge obstacle. 

In highschool I wasn't that interested in dating, I was taking my time waiting for a girl I really like, but now, most of my friends are off with their girlfriends, some even getting engaged, and I'm beginning to feel I will stay alone forever. Any advice would be great.",09Apr2017,10
38,"Sex was only emotional. _I love this person_ so I wanna do him.

Because it was close and it _felt_ close. Sensually, and physically. Well, you're _literally_ _**in**_ me. Caring about someone real hard, makes me sexually attracted to them. I end up thinking the traits they have are what I like. 

Never really explored on what ""types"" of guys I liked. Since I never really felt like I had a choice. The ""beggars can't be choosers"" mentality.

The general feeling of being closer to him, was so very special. It being, I was in 2 long distance relationships. And the times I get to actually be with him, I wanted to do things that you can only do when actually with each other. So usually a bit on the physical touching sense. ^^^end ^^^up ^^^wanting ^^^to ^^^do ^^^alot ^^^of ^^^sex.

It er, feels good but also _feels_ good. I get to get naked and be shameless about my body and sounds I make. We both are. A very trusting thing, that sex is. 

Then boom, it ends. I got cut out. I wasn't it. The end.

The hurt happens, it goes on, need time but I also need to try to get better. And so I try.

_Tinder_

Dun Dun Dun.

Before, had thoughts that Tinder was just hooking up but read up on it and it's probably the least hooking up app out there. As others are just straight up hook ups. 

So I tried to ""casually"" date. Or try to learn what it meant.

Had 2 relationships, both being long distance and unique. First, an asshole with all the red flags. And second, a different kind of asshole- one who doesn't share how they feel often and suddenly things end sorts. And both relationships being very long. 

So what the heck is _dating_.

First tinder date, went nice. Guy was cute and I learned, I like cute asian boys that have nice smiles. Whoop di do. 

Date itself was very movie like, typical but like a nice typical? And a bit on the fast side. Ate lunch, watched a movie, kissed then welp---made out and done the sex. It ended up being a hook up. I think I may have been a bit played but well. Benefit of the doubt. He said he didn't expect it either. 

I've known this guy for 5 hours, and here he is, putting a condom on his dick. _jesus christ I feel like... a slut?_

Very out there for sure.

Me of all people, jesus christ.

Felt weird, cause till that hook up, sex was only emotional-to me. And then, _oh god i just had sex with a stranger cause he was cute and we were both horny._

I didn't look down on people who done do the hook ups, just thought it wasn't for me. And after it happened. I guess, I don't entirely mind.

Just well, never hook up with someone that you're interested in. Cause man, I was really looking forward to meeting him again during the first date-he even said ""next time"". Before the sex happening. 

In a unhappy world, he just got what he came for. In a brighter note, maybe he wasn't too interested in the first place. Eh both an ouch. I got too over my head and got too interested too fast. Jeez, just when someone looks at you- in a way, that just... flutters your heart. The way, they look so eager to hear you talk. That genuine feeling of wanting to hear you. But then again maybe I'm just too easy lol. Whoops.

I ended up asking if he wanted to meet up again, first said he was sick from food poisoning, I waited a week and asked again and said he should be free the following tuesday (4 days from now) and said he'd check his schedule on sunday. He never gets back to me and I wait till monday night. Bring up starcraft remastered (cause he likes starcraft) and he replies, then tells me he can't do tomorrow. Meh alright, but I thought maybe he'd try to work out a different day but that was it. _Whoops_. And well, yes-as friend said, he's being a bit of an asshole. To cancel the day before. And, maybe I've put him in a good light too much. I'll believe everything he said but canceling the day before and not really putting effort in me. Eh, ouch is all. Maybe I want too much. But maybe it's okay. Maybe the guy for me will give me too much. Heh. 

But you know what, I got a plan. Maybe it's cheesey or something that won't work. But _tactics_ boys. I got it.

If I meet someone, that I am really interested in. I'm gonna take it slow, not too slow and scare them off but slow enough. Do that push pull game. As mother told me to do. So! If he goes in for a kiss, I'll lean to the side and kiss him on the cheek and tell him ""Next time on the lips, so I can secure that next date"" or something like that. _Slick_ right? Or maybe not. Maybe it's just frustrating. On both ends. Cause welp, if it's someone I'm interested in, I'd be a bit looking forward to that kiss. 

Although this wasn't a plan completely conducted by me, just er got inspired after hearing some stories... heh maybe it's too romanticized.

I've learned more about myself after the relationships. Know what I'm looking for, learn the way I want to be loved, and how to give someone else love. Of course there's more to learn and every person will give new experiences. Even if it'll hurt, I'll come back up, upgraded.

I can lightly say, hey! I got dumped. But it still tickles a hurt a bit. _I get why so many songs are about break ups_ heh.

39,"I want to start out by apologizing for how horribly written this might be, I've never been good at expressing my thoughts into writing so this has the possibility of being pretty scattered. 

I'm faced with a situation today that I've never known how to face or react to, the possible death of someone I deeply care about.  She's my girlfriends best friend so therefore she's pretty much my best friend too, let's call her tree.

My girlfriend got a message this morning from a distant friend states away saying Tree has been in the hospital since Friday, she was found unconscious in her house.

Nobody knows the exact details of what happened but I have a pretty good idea, I've been on the same path as her before. Lost, feeling forgotten, and riding the high of whatever I could get my hands on, and just like me, she fell in love with opiates. 

We would never use together, she was scared of coming out to us about her use and would hide it, a lot of the times she would just say, ""oh I'm just tired, I didn't sleep at all last night."" But I knew the truth, I've used those exact same excuses before, but I knew what I was doing to myself, I knew that drugs kill and destroy people and completely obliterate any kind of life you've ever dreamed of having, but once you have a taste of that reality of being numb it's hard to come back. 

Thank you for reading this, if anybody out there is at all, if you have any input on any of this please don't be scared to comment or message me.

Anyways, what I know is that she probably overdosed and either is going to die because of it, have some brain damage depending on how long she was unconscious, or by some miracle she wakes up and is completely fine. As anybody would, I deeply desire a healthy recovery.

Saying that though, I can't exactly place my feelings on the situation, I feel sorry that she's feeling lost but at the same time, my girlfriend and I have tried reaching out to her and tried to bring some things to the surface to no avail.

I know what it feels like to be tortured by life everyday, your mind never slows down, always thinking about what you could have been and what you should have done, and just wanting to end everything now in the hopes you are given another chance to retry and do it all over again ""perfectly"". A true desire not to want to live this life again, so I think Tree either consciously or subconsciously tried to kill herself. And if she did succeed in that, I wish her the best of luck the next time around, she's gonna stay in my heart right next to my father who committed suicide almost 4 years ago.",09Apr2017,1

41,"I'm off to the US in a week for a 3 week trip, and tipping is actively discouraged in my country so I've been trying to read through some tipping guides to see what I am expected to tip (e.g.: http://emilypost.com/advice/general-tipping-guide/)

Jesus - do you American's have to carry around a bunch of $1 and $5 bills everywhere you go so you can tip? How else do you do it? I never carry cash around at home, because I just pay for everything with EFTPOS or Credit Card.

Is a guide like the one I linked about accurate? Is that about what I should be expecting to pay? Is it acceptable if I carry my own bags at a hotel (since I would anyway) but in that case am I still expected to tip the guy who would otherwise have carried them?",09Apr2017,4

43,"So basically I'm a 24 year old female. I dated my ex-boyfriend (let's call him Ken) for 3 years. I broke up with him and I started to have a crush on his friend Eric but didn't pursue it for Kens sake and Eric was on and off with this girl. They played a lot of video games together and got close from that.. would go for beers once and a while and had what I would call close friend group that they formed through league of legends. 
Anyways, a year after ken and I broke up I happened to be at a party with Eric and he had recently gotten out of his relationship and I was like what the hell... i invited him to come home with me. We ended up sleeping together and continued to hang out for almost a month until Eric and I decided that I should probably meet up with Ken and let him know what the deal is if I wanted to ever be in a serious relationship with Eric (Ken and I decided we should still be friends following the breakup and kept in touch). Short story is that this obviously blew up in my face and ken lost his crap, these ""mutual"" video game friends took kens side and refuse to talk to Eric and so he lost some close friends which sucks. Got called some pretty rough names and tried to mitigate the damage but that just made it worse. 
But Eric and I have been together for a year now and it's the best relationship I've ever had. I love him more than anything. I would like to think that I've found something incredibly special and don't regret it, but still feel awkward about the whole issue, even a year later.

48,"So I am 36 and I haven't had sex with anyone since I was 25, when I got out of a relationship that was good when it was good and bad when it was bad. It was bad at the end. But we always had good sex, when we had sex, which was less and less toward the end.

She was a woman. I let her see all of me, a body I am very ashamed of because I am pretty hairy, and I can take care of it off and on but it isn't sustainable and can only be done periodically. Plus we lived together and were exclusive...so I trusted her.
When she left, I never trusted anyone again. I felt so duped.
I am actually fairly attractive with clothes on, and off too except for being hairy and other blemishes. I don't work out or anything but I'm not fat.

I think about having sex all the time, with men, which I have done before but not since before that relationship.

But men terrify me. I feel like they are all red pillers who won't have me because of my physical shortcomings, and also I am 36 at this point (but still pretty young looking).

Sometimes I just want to get on Tinder and meet up with guys, bring them to my house, flip up my dress and have them fuck me from behind without seeing me naked or me having to touch them, and then just having them leave my house immediately - with a lot of them, just to make up for lost time. Obviously I would remove any visible hair for these encounters.

What should I do? Is this possible? My shame issues are still there, and I'm so afraid to show myself to someone and be rejected, or to be raped and killed, or to be duped.

55,"I'll try to keep this brief. I do need to dive into some high school stuff before I explain what's happening now.

So I met this girl I'll call Olivia when I was 11 and I developed a puppy-love crush on her pretty quick. Over the years it turned from an innocent crush to a dramatic infatuation which clearly was not healthy for me. My friends would poke fun at me for how serious I was about her. It was especially difficult because she was very good-looking and popular with the guys, it made me sickeningly jealous when other guys got her attention.

Later on in high school Olivia and I ended up spending more time together and actually became pretty good friends, and I started to cool off a bit. After several years of mixed messages and being her shrink when she needed to complain about boyfriends or friend drama, things finally fell into place when I asked her to homecoming and we kissed for the first time. It was a dream come true and everyone was so proud of us for finally falling together after all these years.

We dated for a month-and-a-half. It actually didn't go so well, she was my first girlfriend and I think I was her 11th boyfriend or something, so I didn't really know what I was doing. I felt unconfident and anxious, and she didn't like the energy in our relationship so she broke it off.

Let me give some important details: Olivia and I are both Mormons. My family is very devout, hers isn't. I was very into the whole Mormon narrative, it was a big part of my identity, and one of the cultural rules is that young Mormons aren't allowed to go on dates until they turn 16 and even still aren't allowed to have girlfriends or boyfriends in high school. For this reason, she had plenty of boyfriends through the years (not being devout) and I piously abstained from having any girlfriends (being devout). When we started dating I was proud to have done something that all my friends said was a waste of time, I was the hero who held out through all the bad times, it was a great story. At the same time I was racked with guilt for having a girlfriend in high school, which troubled the waters of our relationship. Our breakup shook me because I didn't know what the state of our friendship was or if I was only going to entropy back into my vain infatuation.

We made an attempt to keep our friendship alive, but it didn't have nearly as much momentum or sexual tension as it did before. After graduating we went to different in-state schools. I made new friends and went to new places. She came and visited me at my Church-owned university once and I didn't feel a lot of chemistry between us.

When I left for my two-year Mormon mission Olivia didn't even say goodbye. I was pretty much moved on from her. After a few months she emailed me asking if we would date when I got back, which caught me off guard. The email made me remember the good times we had, but I didn't want to commit to anything so I have her a purposely ambiguous answer.

I eventually decided that the Mormon mission thing wasn't for me, and I came home after six months. I transferred to a different in-state school from the church-owned one and stopped going to church, further forging an identity outside of what I had been handed as a child and teenager. After my mission I went to see her a few times, we would have lunch occasionally, but it was clear that she kept me anchored in high school when I was clearly ready to grow up. I didn't feel like a had much to say to her. I was sad that we weren't as good of friends as we had been before but I lived so far away from her that we never saw each other. It didn't bother me too much.

I've spent three semesters at this school so far, and I'm pretty content. Last semester I dated a girl for about a week before concluding that I probably only wanted to date her to put some distance between myself and Olivia. I realized it was a dick move and broke it off rather than leading her on, which would have been much worse.

I spent several months at this school happy and fulfilled, being single. I reflected on my life and the decisions I've made and reached a state of satisfaction with myself. I've been seeing a psych counselor who has been helping me through anxiety from my mission and leaving the church, feeling a lack of community, all kinds of stuff. I'm in a much better place than I've been in the past and I feel more like an adult.

I haven't seen Olivia for almost a year, she looks like she's having fun at her school with all the friends she's made. She keeps her relationships off of social media so I haven't known if she was single or not.

My best friend/roommate and I decided to transfer to a university in a bigger city closer to home, which also happens to be the university that Olivia attends. I was nervous at first but over time that nervousness has slowly morphed into excitement to see her again. Maybe something new could start now that we're both adults.
We've been snapping back and forth a bit, and sometimes texting. She says she misses me and wants to have lunch and hang out when I get into town. I said yes, I would like that very much. I'm trying to restrain myself, I don't want to ruin this thing before it begins.
My roommates tell me I shouldn't try to reconnect with her. They knew me in high school when I was in the tar pit of my infatuation with her. Naturally I want to disagree with them. I cared about her and our relationship and I had a nasty habit of bitching to my friends when things weren't going right, but they never heard about the good times between us. I kept her close, she was sacred to me, especially senior year. I don't think my roommates have a very accurate picture of my relationship with her.

To wrap this up, I'm anticipating a reconnection between us but I'm afraid of becoming vulnerable again. I still feel that gripping jealousy when I see a picture of her with other guys, a feeling I'm ashamed of. Is jealousy okay? Is it a sign that I really care? Maybe I'm too quick to judge myself. Pretty sure I'm overthinking this. I want some outside perspectives on whether I'm too attached or not attached enough.

Also one final note: Mormons aren't allowed to have premarital sex, so I grew up avoiding all forms of sexual expression like the plague. Now that I'm out of the church, I'm pretty sure my reckoning is come. If I freak out just by seeing a picture of Olivia with another guy, I'm nervous about finding out if she's had sex or not.


TL;DR: Reconnecting with a girl I dated in high school. Am I too attached or not attached enough?",09Apr2017,8
