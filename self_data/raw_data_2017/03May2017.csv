Except it wasn't. Heavy traffic made me get there late, and there's a very strict 'no late' policy. So I have to miss out, without a refund, and lose the $500 and it's all my fucking fault. Well done, me.

2,"I'm a 28 y/o woman and happily married. I have a younger brother and sister. I am the oldest but we are all adults. 10 years ago my mother was a severely overweight single mom. I had just turned 18 and gotten my first job when she came to me with what I lable as the beginning of all this, although that is not entirely accurate. 

My mom has almost always been a single parent. She had a boyfriend that lived with us when i was 11-15. During those years her alcoholism became obvious. We moved away from him and she got worse. She drank enough to blackout almost daily. I'd find so many purple drawstring bags hidden in nooks and crannies all over our small apartment. My aunt tried to help. A lot. But mom just used her. I was a teenager but I was kind of sheltered and didn't fully comprehend how bad things were nor did it occur to me to say anything to an authority figure. Mom never physically abused us but there was a lot of yelling and stress. I never knew if we had enough money for food, if we were going to be evicted, that sort of thing. 

Between 16 and 18 she seemed to get better. She acquired a well paying job and got some great health insurance. She wanted to get the gastric bypass surgery. She asked me to pay for her co-pay. She was my mom, I agreed. She got the surgery and in less than a year everything changed. She lost a ton of weight (she melted away), she became obsessed with her looks, she left her well paying job because the economy tanked and the business couldn't give her an annual raise. We had to move, I couldn't afford to live on my own so I went with her. Eventually she got a waitressing job. She was good at it. But she ""fell in love"" with the fry-cook. She placed him over her kids (2 of which were still miners). She started drinking more at bars. She was a 5'2"" 110lbs woman with only half her intestines  (from the surgery). Less alcohol got her drunk faster and she just kept drinking. She went from a loving 40 y/o mother of 3 to wanting to be a 20-something mother of none. Us kids became financial burdens.

She lost the weightand her mind.

I lost my job when I was 20 and mom kicked me out 1 month later. She made damn sure I and my sister knew that we were financial drains on her every day. She spent rent money on the fry cook and blamed us for not having enough for bills.

I moved in with a friend and 1.5 years later I met the man I eventually married. I've been with him for 6 years (married for 3). My sister was kicked out soon after I was and she had a rough time getting on her feet but she did and now has a great job. The same with my brother, though a few years after my sister and I since he is a few years younger. 

My mom's drinking only got worse. Every time I would come to visit she would be drunk. She started drinking till blackout every single day. I don't know how she held down a job all those years. She moved in with my who became her keeper. They lived out of state in an employee housing type of thing. My mom is incredibly manipulative and good at convincing people she's going to change. They both worked for the company and mom got better, for a while.

One day I got a call from my sister. Mom had gotten drunk and stolen something from the company. Mom was banned from the property and had to move to another city. A few days later I find out from my brother (he also lived in the employee housing and worked for the company) who said mom had checked herself into a hospital for a 72 hour hold after attempting suicide.

That weekend my husband and I drove several hours to get to her. She tried to down play her actions and swore she'd get help.

Upon leaving the hospital she went to rehab. My siblings kept me updated since I was long distance and mom couldn't call me directly. They told me she was doing well. Towards the end of her 90 day rehab I hear from her directly. She tells me things are looking up and that she met a man (another rehab resident) and she's ""in love"". The pit of my stomach dropped when I heard that. But she's a grown adult and can make her own decisions. They leave the rehab together and get an appartment. Not long after that I hear that he's verbally abusing her. She brushes it off as nothing and they continue on together. The abuse escalates quickly. They both started drinking again and I'm not sure it's ever stopped.

Eventually she leaves him. But he finds her and they get back together. I'm told this cycle repeats several times. It ends with them living on the streets and him throwing a brick at her head. She retrieved the brick and beat the shit out of him before checking herself into another hospital for a 72 hour hold. 

Us 'kids' have a plan to pay for a bus ticket to a completely different state (that she chose), and a month on a cell phone, but after this initial move, I'm not sure what else we can do.

Currently we are waiting for her to contact someone because we don't know where she physically is. All I know is that she's ""in a tent in a field by a building"". 

She's banned from my sibling's property and I cannot have her live with me. She's far too manipulative. She will say exactly what she needs to in order to get what she wants, promising the change and get better, and then as soon as she's in she will slowly start going back to the way she is now. 

I don't know what to do about anything right now.",03May2017,1
4,"I'm on a loop right now.

I want to self-harm. I've done it before a decade ago and it's only been an extremely rare occurrence when I'm feeling severely distressed.

But I've been on and off medication, having trouble with motivation, can't really start to find a job - this all snowballs, and so I want to self-harm. I used to previously self-harm to punish myself because I think of myself as such a wretched piece of shit.

And I'm sitting here with a scalpel, ready and wanting, but do you know what's stopping me? It's not the people who love me who would be upset, it's not the people I love, it's not that I care who sees it (I have plenty scars on my arms I've learned to not care about anymore) it's that I'm scared of the *pain*.

I am too much of a pussy to cut myself and it's fucking with me, because it's like.. I'm so pathetic I can't even bring myself to cut myself. It's making me scream in my head. Why can't I do this. Why am I so useless? Why can't I do anything? Too useless to do grown-up big girl things, too useless to kill myself.

If I didn't have sensations towards pain, I would literally love to stab myself right now bu I can't BECAUSE IT'S TOO PAINFUL. I like to see myself bleed because I fucking hate myself so goddamn much and i can't stop crying.

I know there are phone lines but I've tried one before but it didn't do anything for me. If anything, it scared me away even more.

i don't know what to do. I'm *on* medication, too. I just feel so depressed i'm choking.",03May2017,1
5,"Well it could go on to sex, could be something like a BJ and end right there.  
 
Biggest thing I'm concerned about is finishing early. Like usually while masturbating, if I go on continuously, I'll end ridiculously quick. I can only image how quick it'll be while getting a BJ.  
 
For the record, this will be the first sexual thing I've done in some time, and the other things I have done are pretty much negligible. So even though I'm pretty ""old"" (18-20), I'm pretty easy to get hard and go off. Simply put, there was a time I went off without even touching anything, just through thought (albeit, it was 4+ years ago so its different now). On the other hand, the girl has had a ton of experience and I can already tell she'll know exactly how to do it. And if you're wondering, neither of us are looking for a relationship, so this is quite simply a learning experience for me. We may never talk again after this, idk.  
  
I've heard ejaculating a couple hours before you have sex is a good way to last longer, but y'all need to help me out here.  
 
I know most of you guys will say, ""Oh relax, doesn't matter on how long you last!"" Well, it's pretty clear talking to the girl that she's in it because she wants to be just as satisfied as I do. I don't wanna be left embarrassed as fuck after like 30 seconds of action. I'm a pretty social guy, and have repeatedly made people think I've done way worse things (sex, drugs, ect..) than I actually have. She's been under that assumption, and while I don't push that narrative all, I also don't deny it. Maybe that was a mistake on my part.

My mother, however, fails to understand this. She constantly micromanages me and is always reminding me to do stuff that would be pretty much obvious to anyone my age. And whenever I try to tell this to her, she doesn't listen to me and disregards what I say simply because I'm younger than her.

My father on the other hand actually treats me like I'm a teenager and gives me space. But here's the thing: he's a lazy, ornery old man. He complains about anything that poses even the slightest inconvenience to him, he fails to put his own interests aside for those of the family, and he's completely ignorant of the fact that he too, can be wrong. 

These grievances don't seem to bad, but when put into practice, and applied to crucial real life situations, it gets extremely fucking frustrating. I've hurt myself, and accidentally destroyed some of my own property because I sometimes struggle to find a way to vent from my parents' spitefulness. And when I make these grievances known, what do my parents do? They don't listen or change, they get mad at you for pointing out their flaws, or completely ignore your emotions as if you're some kind of servitude robot.

14,"This happened because everything was a figment of my mind. It’s obvious that *that* is the reason… after all, almost every person I’ve spoken to about my thoughts only refuted my opinion, saying that I was incredibly strong for getting so far and that I’m blind to my accomplishments.  
  
I’m sorry that you were right and I didn’t believe you. I’m sorry that you are here, reading this because in the end, I was incapable of seeing myself from your perspective.  
  
Please don’t see me as selfish. This was simply something I needed to do. After years of being this way, you can only imagine how drained I was of dealing with these thoughts. It was a constant back and forth battle of living and dying. Being here and disappearing. Loving and hating. Being content and throwing away it all.   
  
I hope you know and realize that I really did put all my effort into staying. Unfortunately, my efforts were merely temporary solutions. Simple home remedies that could temporarily alleviate the symptoms but not heal me. Factors such as eating, sleeping, exercising, meditating, staying busy, socializing…   
  
It’s funny how the suggested solutions are actually affected by my thoughts. If you believe that I didn’t put my 110% into it, it’s because I probably couldn’t. Sometimes I couldn’t go out and socialize because my desire to stay in bed and rot was just that much stronger. I needed to eat that extra banana because it was the only thing giving me some kind of satisfaction. Sometimes after a run, my body would feel heavy and the thoughts would come flooding back.   
  
There was no escape from me. There is no escape from you.   
  
You are who you are and if you can’t accept it, you’ll end up like me. 
  
I knew the only way to make it easier on my loved ones was to sever the relationships. I only had a few close friends and I made sure to completely stay out of network from people that simply knew my name and face.   
  
I’m sorry, but I had to. I hope you have the capacity to forgive me. 
  
The only gift I was given in this life was extreme empathy – but it was also a curse. It delayed my actions and thoughts. It put an even more extreme burden on me because I had to juggle between my thoughts and my love for my family and friends.   
  
But you know someone is really struggling when they can no longer help others to escape from themselves.

20,"I'm a 24 year old close to finishing my bachelors. I still live at home due to working part time but home life is extremely volatile due to my father. I usually end up spending a lot of time at the girlfriends place and will be moving in with her soon. 

I'm a criminal justice major and plan on working in law enforcement. My dad came into the house today and started complaining about the death of a cop. I understood his frustration until he dropped the ""They need to hang that nigger from a tree for everyone to see. He doesn't deserve a trial."" As calmly as possible, I explained he cannot use that word and we need to respect the system currently in place. Justice will be served. Then he lays into me, asking me what I know about the criminal justice system. My college education on the criminal justice system literally means nothing to him. So we argue about that for a while. Things get pretty heated. He eventually changed the subject to the death a family member and how he'll never forgive me for not being present when they died. Not only was their death extremely slow (months), it occurred around 3am. I was with that gf sleeping after working, going to school and spending a good portion of the night with that family member. I had said my goodbyes to this family member a few weeks before their death; everything that needed to be said had been said. What also offended me deeply was I took part in a bible study for this family member and I'm not remotely religious. I cared deeply for this person and his attacks essentially questioned my relationship with that person. 

A lot more occurred, but it sucks that I can't even discuss a topic I'm very knowledgeable about with my own father. He literally thinks my understanding of the criminal justice system is a joke because I'm optimistic about the future. I can't count how many times I've been told I'll never amount to anything in my life and how I need to get past my childish dream of wanting to play cop.

Since then, year after year, I've realized that I just haven't been affected enough to cry. My Grandfather died in 2015 and I didn't even cry then.

If they knew how close I have come to shooting my brains all over their desks, things might not be the same. But they probably would anyway.

Over the last year, I have had two relatives die unexpectedly and a friend OD on heroin. I didn't even know he used.

It seems the Republicans now having full control are trying to implement as much corporatist and socially conservative items as they possibly can while they can.  A short but incomplete list:


* Betsy DeVos dumped predatory loan protections for students.  ( Was this holding America back so much it had to be done immediately or at all? )

* School Nutrition standards thrown out among obesity epidemic
* Several cuts were made to the EPA
* GOP advancing plans to gut Net Neutrality
* Jeff Sessions openly admitting he will not investigate police misconduct
* Trump discussing getting rid of the fillibuster
* GOP now wants to not cover pre-existing conditions
* Trump is now in support of interventionist foreign policy
* Instead of fixing military spending, Trump is just going to throw more money at it like usual

Even worse, their automated responses from reports tell you what's going on doesn't go against their ""Community Standards,"" therefore allowing the madness to continue as the hacker begins video messaging contacts, while retaining access to all messages/photos/etc. over 20 days later.

**Backstory:**

On April 9th, we woke up to my wife saying she couldn't login to her FB account. Somehow, her password has been changed without warning. When we clicked her account, we noticed the account name changed to something in Arabic. Then, in attempts to secure the account, we found out that the original email address she created in high school had also been compromised. There was absolutely no way of retrieving either account. That's when we frantically began reporting and emailing Facebook.

Although we often see things like ""I've been hacked, please don't accept any friend requests from the person trying to be me,"" this was completely different. Her account was truly hacked, and now that the person had full control of a decade's worth of photos/content/messages/sensitive material/etc.

In order to retrieve the account, we were requested to submit a license or any legal proof of I.D. This made us uncomfortable, but my wife was dying to get this situation resolved ASAP. So, we followed and provided the proper I.D. However, we never received a true response back - only automated messages like this:

We went on the spend the entire day reporting/emailing/attempting contact with Facebook to resolve the matter. That evening, things started to get creepy.

The person who had hacked my wife's account began messaging me in Arabic. Luckily, Google Translate came to the rescue to allow back-and-forth communication. However, I was not mentally prepared for how this would affect us. We began to have request for money to get the account back, as well as disturbing request such as having sex with my wife. We took screenshots of everything, and began to contact Facebook again. We sent them via email, hoping that this would expedite a resolution. It didn't.

The next morning, my wife was completely distraught, as well as physically and emotionally exhausted from 24 hours of immense stress and confusion.

It didn't take long for her to realize the hacker was now deleting every single friend and group she was a part of. This would be a pain for anyone, but it was extremely devastating for her. Due to the nature of her work, she has clients/partners across the nation that she coaches and mentors. Over the past 4 years, this network has continued to grow, and Facebook proved to be a crucial tool in communicating and coaching others states away, with relative ease.

Once this happened, she began to report and email more and more. Also, to try and move past the situation, she created a new account, since FB wasn't helping her regain access to her original. The funny thing is, less than 48 hours later, this new account was completely disabled by Facebook. The hacked account, however, remained open and accessible to the hacker. That's when he started deleting every photo from her account - a decade's worth of memories, family photos, etc. all gone without warning.

The most infuriating part? Getting emails like this in regards to the situation:

**When these types of automated messages would come in, we would continue to let them know that the situation, in fact, was NOT resolved. This is only one example of a reply my wife sent (none of the dozens were ever replied to, by the way).**

Hello,

It has now been a week since my original account (https://www.facebook.com/_______._______) was hacked. As you can see, when you now click it, all my friends have been deleted, content has been altered, and my name has been changed to **حمزة النصوح** whatever that name translates to. I contacted you immediately last weekend when this account was taken over. However, despite the emails above saying the matter was resolved, I still have ZERO access to this account. 

I sent numerous messages requesting assistance in the matter, and even scanned and emailed you my driver's license. Yet, here we are and I still cannot use my account. My husband and I own a business that requires access to this account. I have thousands of clients I coach and mentor across the nation. Now, I have no way of accessing past messages or continuing business as usual with my various social platforms linked to my original account linked above.

You told me to create a new account, which was done using this email (_______________@gmail.com) and, within a couple days, the brand new account was completely shut down. You sent a message saying the matter would be reviewed and resolved within 72 hours. 

Now, my original account that was seized, is still open and active, yet the new one is disable. The issue we have here is that, upon MANY requests to shut down the hacked account, you still have done nothing to solve the matter. We have requested direct contact with any customer support or representative of Facebook, and have heard nothing as well. We provided screenshots of the threatening messages that the person who hacked my account was sending my husband, including asking for money to get my account back, and telling my husband he wanted to have sex with me. I am not quite sure who is reviewing these messages, but we really would appreciate expediting a resolution in the matter.

If you need any form of identification again, please let us know.

Happy Easter. We are praying this matter can be resolved ASAP.

Thank you,

Later that week, our family members and friends began to have their accounts targeted, and some even had their accounts mirrored (with the fake accounts sending out friend requests), as well as certain groups beginning to publicly share private family photographs.

Even when the hacker, who now had control of the account over a week, changed my wife's profile picture and cover photo to images of himself, Facebook did not care. Somehow, none of this went against their ""Community Standards"" and they would continue to send back automated responses that the issue had been resolved.

After we crossed the 20 day mark from the initial hacking, we realized our business had taken a drastic hit, and my wife's mental and emotional state was truly suffering. To make matters worse, she began to get messages from close friends that the hacker was now attempting to video message and communicate with them.
Yesterday, finally fed up with the situation, we decided that we would attempt to make this situation viral (in hopes to bring it to FB's attention). 

It took the help of numerous friends and family members posting about the situation, reporting the hacked account, and more for us to finally receive some closure - as of this morning, they finally deactivated the hacked account.

Although this was quite a relief, it still pains us knowing that every photo, memory, friend, etc. have been wiped completely, without any chance of retrieval. Knowing that this person had over 3 weeks to comb through the data/messages/etc. of this account also has us on high alert for future issues that may arise. It didn't help that just last night, my grandmother's account was hacked, along with my father's last week.

This entire event has certainly been a learning experience as much as a mind f*$%. There is much more that could be added to, but I believe this does a decent job of summing up how devastating and frustrating a situation like this can be (for anyone).

Please protect yourself, ensure your privacy and security settings are up to date, and realize that as time goes on, things like this will only become more prevalent.

**TL;DR** We screwed up by not maxing out our privacy/security settings on FB - allowing someone to hack my wife's account, and control it for 3 weeks without any help from Facebook. We learned much more about online security and privacy along the way. 

**Edit** **(For The Trolls)** As stated below, the title wasn't nearly as ""dramatic"" originally, but we wanted something that would grab enough attention, in hopes that those who actually read this could benefit from our mistakes and what we learned in the process.

**Edit** With issues like the **Google Docs phishing scam** running rampant right now, privacy and security awareness is crucial. For those who are just here to laugh and poke fun, we can take it and it doesn't bother us one bit. For those who have learned something from our mistakes, or decided to look into their personal privacy/security settings after reading this, great job! (That was the original intent of posting this).

42,"He is so selfish and inept that it's just utterly unbelievable. He literally nearly got the planet turned to glass because he wanted to go party. The entirety of Avengers 2 is him making that beyond stupid mistake and the gang cleaning up after it. And what's even worse is that the films following it are trying to get me to sympathize with him. Yeah, no, the guy almost got Earth immolated because he wanted to go party. He should be in prison and/or permanently retired from being Iron Man. Seriously, how am I expected to like or sympathize with the selfish brat who almost committed the manslaughter of seven billion people due to his desire to parrtaaayy? I honestly can't even. This movie franchise is ruined for me. I can't take it seriously anymore.",03May2017,1
43,"He was giving a speech on feminism. He must have had an erection and tucked it under his waistband because he stretched and his shirt lifted up, revealing the entire ""bulb"" of his swollen cock poking out above his pants waist. He must of hid that thing like a boss because we had no idea until his shirt came up. The worst part is, when the shirt fell back down, it got caught behind his penis and the poor fool had no idea and continued to talk. Girls quickly turned around and whispered to other girls. The teacher didn't say anything other than yell a loud ""OH SHIT"" when it happened. The boy paused a bit then continued to talk. He stretched once more before sitting back down and the shirt properly covered his shame this time. The poor fuck had no idea. Oh. And the whole thing was recorded on a camera the teacher set up. They are going to show it to the parents for some mother's day festival coming up. ",03May2017,21
44,My ex-girlfriend and I dated from the summer before high school all the way up until last week. We'll be going to college in different states and both know that long distance is likely to not work out over the course of the next 4 years. I still have strong feelings for her and don't want things to end until they absolutely have to but know that it is probably best for us to end things and try and adjust before heading off to college. I just need to let my feelings out somewhere and was hoping for some advice from people. Any suggestions as to what I should do?,03May2017,1
45,I had my last test for this class and I completely choked and couldn't remember basic shit. I googled something during to test to look to find the professor giving me a puzzled look.

47,"Things have changed, quit a job cause of a job offer, waiting to start at that job. In that time I also took on a roommate so my bills got a lot cheaper when they weren't even a stressor to begin with. 

I also got approved for Uber/Lyft and out of no where I got several calls to help people buy cars (I sold cars for 8 years, for side cash I'll help people buy new cars for a fee)

All things considered this month even though I won't officially have an income from like...a regular paycheck I'll make enough to pay my bills plus a good margin of error.

Seriously considering starting my own company.",03May2017,1
48,"Hello this semester Jan-May I decided to come study in Paris, the problem I'm having is that before coming here I was visiting a psychiatrist once every two week for reason like depression, insomnia and other disorders.

50,I love someone so much. We used to date and since school started everything went down hill and now we barely can talk. She knows I still love her. And she thinks she does too. Do I just wait or let go and see if she comes back. Today I tried my hardest to talk to her during lunch about it all. She never answered. I haven't been doing anything the past weeks but trying to talk to her. Idk what I did. Let go or try my hardest to get her back. I'm practically blocked on every social media and cellphone. I didn't even do anything. Let go or try my hardest? ,03May2017,2

57,"I always catch the ""What encounter with a random stranger do you remember"" on r/Askreddit too late to motivate me into posting, but I really want to share and preserve the story.

This happened... heh.. multiple decades ago, and I still think about this guy every time I catch myself or my friends obsessing over choosing and having the best equipment/phone/car/whatever materialistic thing, best technique for a given task, blaming equipment/circumstances for a loss in competition, or focussing entirely on the theoretical knowledge and disregarding the practical.

Anyways, I think I was nine. Back then I loved Tony Hawk's Pro Skater on the Playstation (1). For the non-consoleros: that's a skating game where you skate around skate parks and conveniently with ramps equipped towns, and press button combinations to perform specific skate tricks, the names of which would be displayed on the bottom of the screen along with the amount of points added to your score.

I would play that game for hours, memorizing every trick under the pixelted sun, I was absolutely certain I could pull off a 360 kickflip in real life no problem. So, I ask my parents for a skateboard, and I do get one, but it's like a cheap toy store version, thick, heavy, large, cheap wood. Well crap, that's hard to process for an entitled kid. Could you even do real tricks on this thing? It's heavy... Is the deck bent enough to flip it? Surely not.

Regardless, I start taking my new board to the nearby skatepark, practicing some standing jumps for ten minutes, not getting the tail off the ground (you know, shit deck), then sitting down and talking about all those cool tricks I would do if only I had a better skateboard.

So after one of those ""skate sessions"" I stopped by our local takeout for pizza. It's a tiny kiosk-like shop, where you order through a window and just stand next to the bus stop in the quiet side street. So there I am, waiting for my small margherita, and this guy at the bus stop notices the board I keep pushing back and forth. He comes over to me and I'm already pissing my pants. He's a skinny but tall white guy 16-20yo(like... a man!), wearing black sneakers, olive cargo pants and coat, and dreadlocks. He smells funny and has weirdly red eyes.

He holds out his hand: ""Can I take a look at your board?"" Shit. He's stealing it. Should I run? I already paid for the pizza. Do I say no? He's gonna punch me and take it anyways. So I hand it over, preparing to never see it again.

He takes a look at it, looks at me, and just smirks. He then throws the board in front of him, jump on it before it lands, skates to the bus stop bench in a manual, heelflips into a smith grind all the way to the end, another flip on the way down, then another casual pop-shove-it on the way back to me. He kicks the tail and catches the deck with his hand, handing it back to me.

And I'm just stunned. Those are impressive tricks on their own, tricks I've seen older kids practice for hours unsuccessfully. This guy just pulled off a combo. On his first try. On an unfamiliar skateboard. A toy skateboard.

My brain starts to process the awesome that I witnessed: ""Holy shit dude! Was that a nollieflip?!?""

And he just calmly shrugs: ""Iunno. I just do stuff.""

Dude... *Just does stuff*.

Wherever you are, random skater guy, I will never forget the lesson you taught me, and I thank you for that. It reminds me that anything is better than nothing and that you can do whatever the fuck you want, if you just put the work in. It motivates me to keep moving forward, regardless of circumstances. I hope you never changed.",03May2017,3
