0,"Hello,

I know someone will say it, but yes, I have a therapist who is helping me sort out stress problems, but I see her once a week and it feels like a waste of time. 

I constantly have this feeling to scream or just bang my head against the wall just to knock myself out. I easily get pissed off and have done things that have helped like running long distance and exercise. I just need some life advice so I don't end up killing myself. I'm 21 and the therapist I see is through my school so I'm not sure if that makes her a professional. I have no friends or family (sister in a different country). I find myself taking 10mg melatonin every night because I can't seem to hit the feeling of tiredness. I need the feeling of passing out to sleep and when I don't have it I stay up till 3-4 until i'm exhausted. I don't go too in depth with my therapists because I fear what will happen. 

When I talk to her I sometimes zone out and become more aware of reality and just want to yell at her. ",12Oct2017,1
1,"I work in Hollywood and have only been sexually harassed twice at Hollywood parties. Once, the same way Terry Crews was (guy stuck his hand down my pants and grabbed my junk). The second time a much taller man than me lured me outside after I had thoroughly abused the open bar, pinned me against the wall in any alleyway, and began making out with me. I'm a straight man, I have pretty tough skin, and I've never really felt scared about either of these incidents. I feel like, since I'm not particularly scared by what happened to me, I don't really have a need to speak up. But since a lot of people in Hollywood are speaking out, maybe I should say something. I'm not really sure. Right now, I feel more concerned about seeming like I'd be speaking out for attention than I am about staying silent. Just had to get this off my chest, so here I am doing that here since apparently I've been banned from r/offmychest for some reason. ",12Oct2017,1

5,"It doesn't matter if the relationship is a 2 month dating relationship, neighbors for a year, 6 year dating relationship, or lifelong family member, I struggle with ending relationships. Obviously, long term relationships have a bigger hit on me, but I feel like I have an unreasonable reaction to ending simple, less invested relationships. It's a pattern I've recognized in myself, and I've tried to fix it. Unfortunately, that often means me starting relationships with those who I know aren't available or rejecting/distancing relationships. But, even when I do that, I always fall into a sense of ""I figured this out, this time will be different""...but, it never is. I still hurt like fuck when they end. In fact, I defeat my relationships because I'm more concerned about the end of the relationship, as all I can see is that it is inevitable. Can anyone relate? Does anyone have advice? ",12Oct2017,5
6,"Hello Reddit! I am a college sophomore who lives off campus with two other guys. I have a girlfriend who stays over regularly, and I stay at her place (a university dorm with one roommate) as well. About a month ago, my roommates confronted me about how my girlfriend stays over too often, and how it feels like they have a 4th roommate. This was not the impression that I wanted to give off, so I agreed that I would try to compromise with them to make them feel more comfortable. 

Fastforwarding to about 3 weeks ago, my girlfriend's roommate had agreed to take in her friend (a guy) who was studying abroad for the year in Puerto Rico (after hurricane Irma, the people running the program told him to leave.) He has been staying in their dorm room ever since then because staying here is cheaper than flying to his home in Europe. Since he started staying in my girlfriend's dormroom, my girlfriend and I have been at my place much more often. For my girlfriend, sleeping in the same room as a guy indefinitely is not very desirable. And as for the both of us staying at her place; 4's really a crowd in that tiny room. Trying to respect their wishes, I feel like my girlfriend and I have become hermits in my room, only leaving to go to the bathroom, make food, or leave the apartment. 

A few hours ago, I overheard my roommates talking in our kitchen complaining about how they think my girlfriend is overstaying her welcome. A few seconds later I heard, ""it's time to stop playing checkers and start playing chess."" I decided to stay at my girlfriend's place tonight, and tried subtly bringing up the topic before I left. They acted like nothing was wrong. This leads me to my questions...How should I go about confronting them? What are they planning? I am worried that they are going to try to pee in my shampoo/clean the toilet with my toothbrush or something. Or worse, they might try to force me out of the apartment... I dont want any of those things to happen. Any advice would be helpful, thanks guys.",12Oct2017,9
8,"I don’t know what it is. My tone? My body language? My facial expression? Everybody I try talking to seems so put off by my presence. I don’t understand. I always try to be friendly and pleasant with others, but they just respond so oddly to me and I can’t for the life of me figure out what it is. I guess I’m just naturally unlikeable? I never had this problem with others until I started college. Even on days where I’m feeling really good and positive, people still seem to have such an aversion towards me. I shower every day, wear deodorant, a little cologne here and there, brush my teeth, work out regularly, I wear nice clean clothes, hair products etc. Even on the rare occasion when someone approaches me (which literally never happens, but when it does), the person seems to just lose interest in me completely after a couple sentences. People always tell me “it’s all in your head, nobody acts this way!” but I SWEAR to you, virtually EVERYBODY I try conversing with is so turned off by me, there’s just no way it’s in my head. When I observe other people’s conversations, the way they get treated by others is completely unlike how I would get treated in the same situation. 

I’ve had a very hard time making friends for the past few years, in fact I’ve had practically no friends for the past 3 years or so as the limited number of friends I did have moved away for college or work related things. It’s honestly frustrating as hell how people act like I’m some monster with some substantial flaw, when I’m trying my absolute best. 

Anybody else have this problem? ",12Oct2017,2
9,"I haven't seen anyone do that before. It's 9pm at night, and I'm pretty sure no one else saw them. But I saw four of them lined up just waving bye and smiling at us. I thought it was so nice. :(

I don't know why I feel emotional over it. Does anyone know if they're hired by the airline or the airport? I'm flying from Phoenix to Canada, so maybe I'm stereotyping, but I'm excited for everyone being nice to me and my first time there. They're so cute and nice. :')

Ahh. Taking off now. Had I get it out of my system before takeoff. ",12Oct2017,6
10,"Hey folks! I just spent the past few days building LearnSearch (https://learnsearch.xyz/), a web app where you can share learning resources and upvote the ones that help you or are valuable in someway. I asked a lot of people what they wished they knew when they started self teaching or learning something new, and the feedback was always that they wish they could tell the good resources from the ones that lead them astray, and that others were vital in letting them know about this. I wanted to make this same interaction scaleable, so I built LearnSearch! LearnSearch is still in its early, early infancy, and I'm going to continue to build out different feeds, comments, and other cool features. I'd love for you guys to take a look and let me know what you think!
It's my first real crack at a web app, and it took me a few nights, so i'm gonna take a quick snooze ;)

12,"The way I see it, fans fall into three categories. The fan base, the fandom, and the fanaxis. The fan base encompasses all fans of the game. They enjoy a thing, so they are a fan. The fandom is all the big fans who make fan works. They still enjoy it normally, and are not insane. The fanaxis contains all the crazy fanazis. These are the people who go on long rants on how you're a terrible person for not enjoying the same things as them. These are the origin of many copypastas. The problem comes in when people confuse the fanaxis with the fandom and the fan base, and assume all people who enjoy that thing are fanazis.",12Oct2017,0

26,"I won't bore you with my sob story. It's pretty much the same as everyone else's. Used to watch at least 8 hours of porn every single day. Started when I was 2 years old. Jerked off so much that my right biceps was 4 times the size of the left one. 

I still remember the day I discovered **nofap**. Honestly, I didn't believe in what you guys were preaching. But I had hit rock bottom and I was willing to try literally anything to stop my addiction and turn my life around. Luckily, I kept a journal, so here's how it all went. Obviously, this is the cliff notes version, a recap (I have 9265 pages, so not gonna bore you, but if you want I'll send a pdf, just PM me). 

**First 10 days on nofap** - Withdrawal. Shaking and sweating bullets, obviously diarrhea. Vomiting for 3 hours straight every single day. Barely 2 hours of sleep per night. All I can think about is Amy Schumer and vaginas, but I resist the urge to touch myself. Neil deGrasse Tyson's podcast and Rick and Morty help take my mind off things and get me through it.

Now, we all know, the first 10-20 days are the hardest. At this point, around day 15, things were starting to get slightly better. No more diarrhea. Vomiting only once a day, for like 15 minutes, so no big deal. Stool status: semi-solid. Pretty uneventful, so fast forward to day 30.

**Day 30 on nofap** - First breakthrough. A fog had lifted. Maybe watching Rick and Morty had something to do with it, but I did an IQ test and it turned out my IQ is 25 points higher than it used to be. Nice! Mind clear. 30 kilos of pure gains, 100% protein and pure muscle. Girls mirin. Stopped going to the gym at this point - don't need to, to this day. Teleportation still difficult, but I am able to successfully read minds and predict future. Tore down the Amy Schumer poster from my wall - does nothing for me any more. 

**Day 60 on nofap** - Slowly but surely rupturing the time-space continuum. I am now able to ""see the matrix"", so to speak (those on day 60 will know exactly what I mean). Switching between universes with ease. 5 inches taller than I used to be. Penis also bigger, almost reaching my knees when flaccid. Pheromones kicking in big time, women throwing themselves at me wherever I go. Had to switch apartments because there was over 600 Instagram models and gonewild girls camping in front of my apartment complex (TIP: this is common around day 60, so when I had to go to the health store to buy protein shakes I'd just open my window at stare at them, which would cause a collective 5-hour orgasm, making them incapable of chasing me down the street - do this and you'll be able to run errands with ease).

**Day 90 on nofap** - Able to see the reality for what it is. Unlocked the biggest secrets of our universe. PhD in physics, law, chemistry and gender studies. Nicknamed STEMM Jesus. Invested in bitcoin. One with God. Regularly communicate with entities from other dimensions. Able to teleport easily, whenever I want (saves a lot of time, you'll see for yourself). Telekinesis is a joke at this point -  influencing the physical world without physical interaction effortlessly. Able to fully understand Rick and Morty - no jokes flying over my head any more. Dating Scarlett Johansson and Gisele Bündchen (sorry Tom), Elon Musk best friend. Tutoring Neil deGrasse Tyson. IQ: 265. 

Imagine what I'll be able to do in a year? Listen to me, if I can do it, so can you. No more excuses. If this doesn't motivate you, nothing will. You can turn your life around, no matter what people tell you. Life can be beautiful, but you have to stop jerking off. There is no better time than now. Have to run some errands now and meet up with Elon (we're re-watching all Rick and Morty episodes). I'll be thinking about you guys. I'll be back in 3 months and report on my progress.

34,"It's a complete myth, and there is no solid scientific evidence for this. 

The reason people's sleep is messed up is because:

1. They don't go to bed when nighttime falls.
2. They continue sleeping when morning arrives.
3. They only sleep once per 24 hour day

Try this: 

1. Go to bed early in the night. No earlier than two hours after the sunset, and no later than midnight (the middle time between sunset and sunrise, might not necessarily be 12:00 AM).

2. Wake up AT THE LATEST a half hour before sunrise. But there is essentially no such thing as too early. I love waking up way before sunrise.

3. Stay awake until sunrise, and beyond. **WARNING: YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE DURING THIS TIME REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH SLEEP YOU GOT**. You are allowed to take a nap once you have woken up, done a bunch of things, and begin to tire again. This depends day-to-day but it could be any time from 8 AM to late afternoon. But generally/ideally, it should be late morning/early afternoon.

Know this: if you primarily sleep while the sun is rising, you have COMPLETELY fucked up your sleep. This is a fact. The only thing worse than this is an all-nighter where you go to sleep after the sun rose (teenagers and young 20s tend to do this). You must sleep early in the night, and wake up before the sun rise, for your sleep to be correct.  

If you do what I tell you, you will feel twice as refreshed and will only really be sleeping between 3 and 6 hours per 24-hour day.",12Oct2017,0
35,"It doesn't seem to matter what you say or do these days, somebody somewhere is going to find a way to be offended by it. I have seen some people, from news headlines to social media outbursts, get offended by the most ridiculous things.

And that's fine, they have that right. It's a free country, after all.

What we need to do though is start *ignoring* these people. Just stop paying them attention and leave them alone. Stop quoting them, stop leaving outraged comments on their posts, stop screen capping and sharing and retweeting them, stop giving them a larger audience and validating them with our reactions.

They might be legitimately offended, or they may just be trolls, but what they strive for is our collective outraged response.

And we've been giving them just that.

Hand over fist, we've given it to them. We've given them the responses they crave. We've given them the views, the comments, the likes, the shares, the retweets, the reblogs. It's what tickles that little spot in their brain that tells them they've done good and encourages them to go and invent just one more new and unusual controversy. Just one more.

Public outrage is a powerful and dangerous weapon, and they've learned to use it and twist it so that the world kneels before them. They've learned that if they make themselves loud enough and threaten with boycotts and negative ""1-star"" reviews, entire corporations will stop and bend over backwards for the sake of the almighty dollar. 

These days, the industry will drop everything and replace creative talent, art, anything with a different ""offending"" viewpoint with cheap, bland, bubblegum pop which blend in to the background of our popular culture. All this just so they won't run the risk of disturbing the handful of social justice warriors who we have branded as our voice through the undivided attention we seem to be giving them on social media.

It's time to stop the social media idiocy. It's time to stop catering to the snowflakes, liberal and conservative alike. The only reason they get so much attention, the only reason their voice is so loud is because we gave them that voice. We gave them that attention.

But without us, they are *nothing*.

I've been hearing and putting it together between the lines since I was a little girl that that was going on in hollywood. In fact it's a trope in many industries, and has for a long time.
