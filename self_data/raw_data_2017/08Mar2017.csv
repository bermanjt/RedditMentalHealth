It's freaking me out. That spelling feels very real to me, as if it's been that way my entire life.

And out of sheer reminiscing, I decided to listen to a recording of my grandmother from her wishing me a happy 20th birthday in 2010. Now I'm absolutely bawling my eyes out. She died in February of 2013 and sometimes I *still* forget she's not alive and that I can't just fly out to Texas to see her.

13,"I've been thinking about my ex a lot lately. The first time we broke up was all kinds of fucked up, but last year we tried again and things seemed to be going great. I technically understand why we're not together right now, as in I could tell you the reasons, but they're fake news. We both still love each other and we're actually pretty compatible, there was no horrible event or animosity or what have you, so it's pretty much bullshit.

The last thing I said to her was to either stick it out or never call me again. I tried to mean it when I said it but I've never been able to do that with her. I'm pretty sure she knows that too but I can never be sure. I just wanted her to stop struggling against herself in regards to our relationship and relax about it but she couldn't manage that. When I said that as an ultimatum it kinda backfired on me and I tried to buy into it myself afterwards but of course couldn't. I wasn't trying to play games, I was just sick of worrying about it, and hoping that I'd finally make the ""right"" decision to move on. lool

I haven't spoken to her for a month this time. Every time I get the urge to contact her I message one of my other friends and they talk me down. Last night I didn't sleep and as always I lose my resolve when I'm exhausted so today I texted her ""I miss you"". I wanted to say so much more but I didn't. I didn't think it was very likely that she would respond because usually when she makes a decision like that she internalizes it as truth even though it's based only on a temporary emotion, sort of like ""I said it so I can never go back now lest I be a hypocrite"". Last time I was speaking with her she was taking a class on Tuesday nights that ran until 8:30. I don't know if she still is, but if she was it's been about an hour since that ended so she should be home now. If she hasn't texted me back by now she probably isn't going to. Oh well, I sort of feel better about letting it out that I'm thinking about her. I think it's equally likely that she archived the message without reading it, or immediately ran off to cry because her only other outlet would be indulging me and she can't let that happen.

I realized recently that I'm not lonely because I don't have a significant other, I'm lonely because I don't have her specifically. You may think ""well yeah you dumb idiot you're going through a breakup or something not really whatever"", but it's more that I miss the exact set of circumstances under which I lived my life with her, than I miss her as a specific character. Anyone else could play that character and I would be equally happy, but of course no one else would be able to. I'm sad that I feel comfortable sleeping in my bed alone tonight, I'm sad that taking a shower alone is normal now (don't question it). When I wrap my arms around another girl at night I don't like it, I want them to leave so that I can be alone because they just remind me of her. At least alone I can immerse myself in a game of Counter-Strike and get her off my mind for 30-90 minutes at a time. I get matches on Tinder and don't even message them anymore. I scroll through attractive women on OKC and don't even care and just close it.

She claimed that she was too busy trying to get her life together to be with me. That's definitely a 'let you down easy' line, but even if that was the case I know that she believed it. It's definitely true that she isn't living up to her own standards, but our relationship perpetuating that is a fallacy. I have the same problem now but for exactly opposite reasons. She doesn't think she's skilled enough for the career she wants and doesn't have a good job. I'm good at what I do and have a great job, just so happens she wants to do what I do. I have my good job and material possessions but I don't have a ton of friends now that I'm out of college and on the other side of the country, and have definitely been spending too much time alone. She's become somewhat of a socialite and always has things going on even if she doesn't feel up to it. It pains me from an existential standpoint that two complementary sets of features and flaws are purposely held apart for seemingly no reason. The notion is too exhausting to be saddening anymore. I'd love nothing more than to help her achieve all her professional goals and in turn get to have fun things to fill my schedule. When we were together we were a great couple, people loved spending time with us together and I was extremely proud of that. I don't think I've ever said that out loud before.

I should write poetry. I think poetry sucks but I'm sure I'd like my own. My phone just vibrated. I know it's not her, but I'm still going to hold my breath while I unlock it. I know talking to her again and trying to make things work again is a stupid and an objectively bad idea but I'd do it in a heartbeat.

21,"My entire life thinking about books has invoked misery and suicidal thoughts in me(well...maybe not that far...)

I've had a very sad and unbearable childhood, might say I live that life today as well, just not as dark as it was...being forced to read books in school always made me sadder and even more depressed, later regretting I read that 'piece of art' as I've got nothing from it but wasted time.

I need to note I have nothing about books which directly tell me stuff I need to learn; I enjoy math, physics, electronics, it all makes sense and it's pretty straightforward, solving the problem gives me joy, whilst the books I've read bring me no such stuff...I do also, well, like epic fantasy, I did read the Hobbit and I'm also reading a Song of Ice and Fire series, yet those still took some time, partially because I almost immediately forget the previously read sentences, partially because I didn't understand what I read(or what its purpose is)...

Yes...those are books - but it's not school literature! (at least not where I'm from). My teacher forces us to read strictly school literature as it 'enriches our vocabulary' or 'our sentences will be prettier' etc. I did give those books a try, but I could never emphasize with the author and his/hers words and feelings, I could never feel or see what he/she wanted to say, I have never learnt a valuable lesson(and really, I tried)...over time thinking about reading those gave me bad thoughts, when I finally came to the point where I stopped reading and started reading the book summaries, as I didn't want to waste anymore of my precious time...

How can I force myself to like this literature enough, or rather make it less hurtful so I can sit, read it, remember it, learn a thing or two aaand probably enjoy it? Is it really necessary, or 'enriching my vocabulary' could be done with any literature really? Or really this is what I'm stuck with and have to accept it and move on?

This parking space is closer to the building than several other spots that fill up quicker, and is not reserved for anyone.

SO WHY? Am I missing some inside information about the taboo behind parking under a light? The only two things I can think of is: 

1. More likely to get bird shit on your car, but it's been happening all winter when birds are less likely to hang out on a light pole.

2. People like to pull through and don't want to worry about hitting the light pole when they do, but any other spot they would have to worry about hitting another car if the person opposite them didn't leave first.

""I don't want to be manipulative or ask this shitty question, but I don't want to ask the question because I already know the answer""

I urge her to ask the question.

""Do you love me more, or your job?""

She's talking my dream job, my passion, everything I love at university that isn't her.

Of course I love her more. She doesn't believe me. I told her again, and she nods. I kiss her, I hug her. I love her.

But she's jealous of me. She told me she is jealous of me, and that she envies me. She told me this for a second time on Thursday. She encouraged me to apply for the job, even though she was running for it too. At the time I had a crush on her, but we weren't together. And I won, I was elected. This was months and months ago.

Yesterday she told me she wants for us to have separate interests, separate friends, so that our relationship is healthy. I know she's right, but all I feel from this is ""I get to spend less time with her"".

I'm scared I love her too much. We have told each other we love each other, but I am always the one hugging her, kissing her, saying I love you. Sometimes she replies, sometimes she doesn't.

The craziest thing on my mind is probably stemming from the fact that this is my first ever relationship—it's most definitely still puppy love—but I've stayed at her flat for almost two months in total since I've met her. And I met her in September. We can spend days and days and days together.

I'm only 18, and I'm only in my first year of university, but I feel like I could spend the rest of my life with her. And I know that's just infatuation.

Everything isn't perfect though. The honeymoon period is slowing down for me, and I'm okay with that. It doesn't have to be perfect!

I'm scared right now. Not because of my relationship, but because of what I have coming soon.

I'm going to have a ton of responsibility thrust upon me, and that in itself could destroy me or my relationship.",08Mar2017,2

Yes, currently in therapy. I have two friends that have a great deal of influence on me.A who is hardworking and an international student,B is born in the US. They're polar opposites. A pushes me to work hard and she believes that will take you far and to make the most of my opportunities because to quote her, some people are fortunate enough to be born with golden spoons in their mouths. Friend A is highly intelligent and wants to climb up the career ladder so she doesn't go back to her country. Then friend B who I met last semester who is easy-going and enjoys the simple things.

39,"Hello, this is my first ever reddit post and I just need to post something here because my mind is starting to break. I have no idea if I am cracking up or if this is just a phase. I have been having panic attacks recently along with paranoia episodes around people, mainly fellow students, at my high school. They come at will but mainly during times where I am crowded around several people. When they happen it is embarrassing, sometimes people look concerned or just chuckle a bit, when this happens I try to make it stop but in only gets worse. No, I do not have any close friends or people I get to talk to, only staff when they happen to see it happen. I was mistakenly put in classes with not very academic students, even though last year I made A's and B's in all subjects. I do have Asperger's which may be a contributing factor to all of this happening. I am extremely afraid of students at my school, and I mean EXTREMELY. When I try to speak up it sounds shaky and they usually tell me to speak up. I try to be relevant and outgoing to people I've known for a long time but they just seem to be slowly drifting away. I've had people say bad things to me and I have had bad kids beat me up. People always tell me to talk to someone if I am having problems with people but the thing is, it's all psychological, it's all in my head. And like I said, I do not have any close friends or anybody to reach out to when I'm having problems. I have tried to talk to people who I would consider my 'friends' in the past but they just seem to be at a loss of words when I try talking to them. They either nod their head in acknowledgement or they may just say they cannot help me, which really bothers me. All I can talk to is my parents and they do not understand a THING about what goes on at my school. About the paranoia, these students at my school, sometimes when I see them, I have this creeping idea that they really dislike me or want to cause harm to me even though I do not see this on their face physically. When this happens the panic attacks arrive an hour later at most. But I am drifting away from the students at my school and people in many other places too. I try to make the bad thoughts go away but they always come back, and they never leave. I'm really deciding whether I belong with these people or not. If anybody needs clarification on issues I will be happy to explain

Anyway, I'm getting on track with my life and things are slowly falling into place. However, this crush is killing me.

Working on several Spotify playlists lately revisiting a handful of artists from the past, I managed to run into Mos Def again after such a long time (disinterest in all kinds of music because of depression). I remember when I was a teen I didn't get the culture, didn't dig the flows, the usage of samples, the obscure references and black culture overall. I was neck-deep in classical, new wave, electronic and alternative until I decided to get out of my comfort zone and try trip-hop, first-ever baby step towards exploring other genres that I had a hard time vibing with. Massive Attack's **""Karmacoma""** introduced me to the native son, speaking in the native tongue, so I made the jump from Bristol to Brooklyn. And after a few listens to **""Black on Both Sides""** I became a convert, my day commutes from there on prominently featuring twenty-something tracks of rap artists ranging from Tupac to Raekwon, spitting bars and bars of substance ranging from socio-politics to narcissism, then to sliding at parties while high, to public feuds, to love letters for the music industry. From a third-person's perspective, a 5'2"" Asian young female adult audibly reciting verses from **""Express Yourself""** on a bus with loud pop music, in a third-world country, was prolly bizarre, well, thank Yasiin for that imagery.

Some days I didn't get his schtick, his rock-and-roll showings and his 'performances,' but he was always up for the challenge, always pushing his own boundaries, never afraid to veer extreme left or right. His art (music and acting) showcased his complexity and profundity, and despite my inability to love 2009's **""The Ecstatic""**, he exuded authenticity from the get-go which I admired, cementing the fact that he would never ever succumb to procuring anything that people would digest and vomit in a few months despite the emergence of social media culture and the annoyances that came with it, affecting the quality of music making its rounds every darn week. It assured me that nothing like **""Crank Dat""** tracks will ever see the light of day, at least with his name stickied. Of course there are artists much more talented than him who revolutionised the rap scene, but the unabashed man behind **""Ms. Fat Booty""** was the catalyst, the instigator that compelled me to pay due respect hip-hop deserves, and I might be reaching a bit here, but some of the finest work it has produced are comparable to classical poets and writers like Keats and Joyce. My opinion prolly sucks but this is how I feel. Lol.

I'm looking forward to his last album before he retires. I'm sure as heck I won't understand it. He's onto some next-level shite now. For the meantime I'm going to jam with **""Black Star""** once more and the new Future album, hoping it's any good.

PS. [The Fader article from 2000](http://www.thefader.com/2015/09/14/mos-def-cover-story-issue-3) on Mos paints a pretty good picture of him and his art, I recommend it to everyone. His views on music labels, religion, the internet, philosophy and all other shite doesn't feel dated at all. I'll leave you now with a quote from the man himself:

&gt;I think it all depends on what people are trying to do. If people are trying to be famous, then they’ll do one thing. If people are just trying to support themselves and put their music out and do so in a way where they control what they create—they control how it’s presented, they control the bulk of the money that they get—and that’s what they wanna do, they’re gonna do another thing. Some people wanna achieve notoriety so they can use whatever acclaim or light that they have to shine it on broader issues, donate to something other than themselves. At the end of the day, it’s all based on people’s intentions on what people are trying to do.
