0,"I’m sorry guys, I need to vent.

It’s my 20th birthday today. I’ve hated this day for the past couple years, since freshmen year in high school when I moved high schools and lost all my friends. I never gained any. This day reminds me how lonely I am, and what a sad pathetic sack of shit I am. I cried last year, and as much as I tried not cry today, I just did 5 minutes ago. It’s just so hard and sad being lonely.

It was going great. At midnight, it stared snowing here in my town, first time I’ve ever seen snow in my life (I live in Texas) and it was so beautiful. Truly. So I saw it as my gift from nature haha. Come morning I went to work and I was in a good mood. Was laughing and all with my co workers and we ate cake and all, ordered some wings. 

Then I got home, and my parents were here. Then they stared to ask me all these sorts of questions like “what are you going to do” or “what do you want us to do for you” “what’s the plan”, and I just simply told them something like “I don’t know” “I’m not sure” “we’ll see”. I starting climbing my stairs, and right there I was already tearing, and when I finally got to my room, I just broke down and cried. It’s truly sad for me knowing that people out there have friends to celebrate with, get lots of birthday wishes in person and on social media, and just are happy on their day. And here I am crying alone in my room, with no one to spend it with, only being reminded that I’m a very sad pathetic person with no friends. It just hurts.

It hurts more because this summer I had my first dating experience, and this girl had told me that she would like to do something for me on my birthday, like go out and have dinner. I was so happy from the idea, I finally wasn’t going to me alone on my birthday and I’ll be with a girl I really like. It was getting serious between us but sadly, things ended because things didn’t work out, and I lost her. It hurts thinking how good this day could’ve been with her in the picture oh well.

I’m sorry for the vent. I’ve been trying to self improve. Started doing PPL this week, I’m reading more, and began meditating. But I guess I’m not close to being improved at all. 

Thanks. ",09Dec2017,11
2,"My mom was gone visiting a friend and luckily I could share the house with my dad without her interference.   It was nice to get a break from that since she tends to be critical over the smallest details that she things I do ""wrong"".

Some examples:

* I told her I had to pick up some medicine today at the drugstore where I used to live, so that's at least a 30 minute drive.  When she returned from being away all day I decided and announced to her that I was leaving to drive to the drugstore.  She then said why today, why did you wait all day to do it and just go tomorrow when it's daytime.  I knew I needed one of the meds tomorrow AM so told her I'd go today anyway.  She criticized me for that decision.   Maybe I should've just told her I was going out and made something up?

* Dad recently blew up at me for storing several tortillas in their basement freezer because their kitchen freezer is smaller and was full.  I assured him I would take care of it and left them as is.  Today I brought up to Ziploc bags with the tortillas to the kitchen where mom stood cleaning up.   I was sorting them out, apparently there were like 20 large frozen ones that I had forgotten from a few months ago.   She again nagged me for buying so many but I sorted them out as best I could. 

* Then I saw a glass on the kitchen table and asked her whose it was because I noticed some spots on the inside assuming it was hers or it just needed to be cleaned.   Then all of a sudden she flew into a rage, much angrier than I've seen her before and yelled to me,  ""I JUST WASHED THAT GLASS, PUT IT AWAY!!""

It was such a strange exaggerated reaction.  I looked at it again and said nope, I can't do that, let me just rinse it.  Then she blocked my passage and actually forbid me from using the sink to accomplish the task.   She again yelled to put it away and I said listen it's still dirty just let me take care of it.   She then threatened to spray me with water and I backed off.   I was taken aback by how crazy she got but gave in to restore the peace.  Then she criticized me for something that I did over 7 years ago when I was living in a filthy apartment and didn't wash my dishes often enough.  I was in that dirty place until 2010, that's more than 7 years ago and have since changed...nowadays when I'm at my own place or rent a room, I wash the dishes daily.

Any advice on how to deal with a nagging mom?   I'm supposed to stay staying with my parents until Boxing Day (Dec 26) during temporary (I hope) unemployment.

3,"I see it all the time: people talking about how many hours overtime they do, how they don't get any sleep because they're too busy working, how they have so many jobs and they work their arses off. If you need to work that much to survive, well done for managing it and trying to look at it in a positive light. But being exploited by your workplace or living in an economy where full-time work isn't enough to live off isn't something to be proud of. Being more sleep deprived than the next person doesn't make you better than them. Taking on extra work and then ""complaining"" to everyone about it so they know how good you are at working is ridiculous. 

There's nothing wrong with a good work ethic but so many people are treated like crap by their employers and then pride themselves on never missing a day/taking a holiday/saying no to extra hours. 

It shits me too because heaps of people like this go home to their partners/families etc and treat them poorly because they're too overworked to engage in real relationships. You're not winning at life if you're working 80hrs a week and never having fun.",09Dec2017,703
4,"I feel like I'm expected to meet too many expectations. The past couple of months have been the most stressful in years. I'm not even sure what to write about here. I've had so many papers to write, and hardly any time to work on them, final papers were discussed and then never talked about until a couple weeks before classes were to end. I had to stay up for about 3 days (I don't remember exactly because I didn't leave my room much) and drink a 5-hour energy every 20 hours to get it all done because I was so busy dealing with other assignments that it wasn't until a week before they were due. I've been on what might as well be a starvation diet because I consistently forgot to eat and didn't have much in the house anyway, the amount of coffee I had to drink has taken its toll and I think I'm having some kind of weird acid-reflux that is causing perpetual discomfort and and occasionally pinching. 

I've got a friend I care too much about who keeps fucking up. I thought he had an epiphany yesterday and finally saw the gates of hell and decided to change, but today it turns out he was actually just on cocaine and xanax. The second I start to really feel for him again and think that this time he's serious about getting his shit together I'm met with utter disappointment and some other feeling I can't describe.

I've got a headache. I've let the water in my 75-gallon fish tank evaporate to the point that i can hear the drops accumulating under the lid drip back into it. I can't feel my right thumb. I've had 12 hours to sleep and I'm still tired. I've been having chest pain since finals season started. And all the while I'm expected to make good grades and work diligently. When I talk about my problems my parents act like they care, but then when it comes to school they completely forget or haven't a clue how fucking hard I work. They start questioning me like ""are you almost done"" when I'm scrolling through youtube for something to listen to.

The truth is that I've been scared of myself for awhile now. Whenever I get stressed out I lose sight of myself and start fantasizing about saying and doing horrible things to myself and the people in my life, things I know I could never take back. They don't try to show me any basic human decency, like the kind you should expect from family and friends. It's like when they know what you want and need to hear in a given moment, but they'll only tell you what satisfies their need to tell you something, like they can see but don't care that you're hurting. And whenever those thoughts spring a leak the consequences are completely one-sided, like I'm not allowed to be angry ever, and that just fills me with a painfully suppressed rage. Why am I the only person who can't have angry outbursts and get away with it? Why does it feel like I'm in a cage? And through all of this, I'm fucking freezing and I don't have a heater or anymore dry-warm clothes.

I have way too much to think about. My mind feels completely overloaded all the time. I just want to sleep. I just want to, for once, have nothing to think about. I'm tired of thinking. I don't know what to do. I feel like a crazy person, but at the same time I feel numb.",09Dec2017,2

6,"I did some research on my dads side of the family, my father whom I haven't seen since I was 6/7. Turns out I've got a cousin who goes to the same HS as me and I talked to him on Facebook and we're meeting up on Monday. The only thing we really know about each other is that we were involved in a car crash as kids. Is it weird for wanting to know that side of the family after not knowing them for really any of my life? My father was, and probably still is an alcoholic and I can't speak for the rest of them.",09Dec2017,4
7,"Honestly a few months ago I was depressed as shit. I still have my moments, but this was on a whole other level. For a couple of years I’ve felt insanely aimless, hopeless and just all round unable to get myself to do simple shit. I was working extra shifts at a job I hate just cause I didn’t have the motivation to turn them down. I was skipping almost every lecture I had to go to in college. I’d made no friends all year. In the summer all I done was lie in my room all day and on the weekends I’d just drink a shit ton and get high with my friends from school just to numb how shitty I felt. It was awful. 

This girl was in my life as a good work friend, but nothing beyond that. We always naturally clicked and I suppose looking back I had a kinda small thing for her. She has a boyfriend though so I always just kinda kept my distance a little even though we got on well She started at my college and she suggested we grab lunch on her first day cause she didn’t really know anyone, and I kinda nervously agreed. We met up and it was amazing. We just walked and talked for hours, it was like we clicked on some deeper level again. From then on we’ve talked everyday for hours and we hang out most days in college. 

I think one thing I really just didn’t have in my life was a deep human connection. Like someone that cared for me. Like my other friends, I love them, we have a great time at the weekend, but it’s different with her. We’re just completely on the same wavelength. Like she’s actually interested in my life and supports me. After a few weeks we both acknowledged that we probably talk to each other more than we do our friends. And now a half a year down the line we are pretty much best friends. And I hope we are for a long time.

Just having someone who wants to see me succeed has honestly meant everything to me. I’ve not skipped a class. I go out at the weekends, but now it’s just to enjoy myself and not some sad desperate attempt to numb my pain. I stop taking shifts at my job I didn’t want and actually stood up for myself. I study. I started reading recently. I want to do better than I had. I actually want to fucking try. And I honestly think if she hadn’t been there to make me see that people can care about me, and see the value I have, then I’d still be at square one. She makes me want to be a better person.

At this point I am hopelessly into her, but she still has a boyfriend. But honestly while that hurts sometimes, it’s nothing compared to the sheer pain I felt without her there. Having her in my life has just made me feel so much better. I can still have bad days, but they’re not nearly as destructive and aren’t some consistent waking nightmare. I’m not gonna ruin our friendship, maybe one day it will be more, but right now I’m just happy having someone in my life who gets me. I don’t think she’ll ever know what she did for me, but honestly it feels like that girl genuinely saved me just by giving a fuck. I think that’s sometimes a large part of what life is missing.",09Dec2017,6
8,"For some time I've maintained this narrative of ""why do shit if you're gonna die"". And afterwards I thought, ""why not do shit anyway"", but that answer wasn't satisfactory because it just sounded like a knee-jerk ""why not"" reaction. I think I got it, though, and what it's trying to say is ""you have infinite time to be space dust and do nothing but only a few years to be a human being"" which is meaning in and of itself. So long story short I think I figured out the meaning of life.",09Dec2017,11
9,"I didn't get A's in high school, in fact I skipped school so much, I had to pay for extra classes just so I could make my credits for graduation. I also didn't go to college straight after high school, or get a job, or do anything at all. I was over-weight by 60 pounds, I had no confidence &amp; I was in a relationship full of insecurities. Me and my family wasn't close, although they always made sure I got whatever I wanted, with the help of three older brothers as I am the youngest. 

Growing up, I thought things would just happen. One day I was gonna wake up &amp; figure out my passion, figure out who I was &amp; who I loved. My body was gonna change &amp; I was gonna stunt on that walk. Everybody was gonna love me for my charisma &amp; intelligence, while I played everything so cool.

But life's not like that... 

Everything you want or need in your life, you have to go get it. You make it happen &amp; no one else, if you want a brand new car, get a job. If you want 6 pack abs, you go outside &amp; start working out &amp; if you want to have intelligent mind, pick a damn book up. 

&amp; No. You don't have to go ham and cheese &amp; over fill your plate. You could start doing 5 push-ups today &amp; at the end of the month, you'll be at 145-150 ( break days ) Now that's better than 0 starring back at you. 

So while I figured all of this out, i lost 50 pounds in a year. I have more energy than every &amp; I feel incredibly more positive. When I am asked to do anything, I am more willing to help. My mindset changed &amp; now I am working on bettering myself instead of just hiding. My relationship is healthier than ever, we still have struggles but that's what every relationship is. Me and my family are close and we can actually talk about things. I am starting school in February for business management, so that's Cool. 

I found many problems with myself &amp; although there is a lot, I know it's one step at a time. It's crazy to think how I am such a different person than I was a year ago, or even two. It's the little steps you take every single day, that will add up. ",09Dec2017,1

We didn't work out because of her emotional instability and my own issues. We had a FWB arrangement for a long time, but she was crazy in love with me. When I got a GF and stopped fucking her and hanging out with her as much, she had a serious breakdown and eventually left town.

I have been seeing said GF for a year. We have an open relationship. She is sweet, if a little conservative in bed. She is pretty wonderful by and large.

X and I have reconnected as friends and she has sorted her life out to some degree. I know she wants me back. However I feel my GF would not approve, and we have already had some issues so I don't want to push my luck. 

Even worse, if I fool around with X, get involved with her, and then bail on her again, there is a high probability she will kill herself. She was already in the hospital after the last time. 

I'm not looking for a solution, I know it can't happen. I just need to get it off my fucking chest finally. I miss that porn star slut. I don't miss the crazy, and I am way happier with a sane, mature woman.

28,"My story is a weird one.

I was an eccentric, charismatic child who was extremely social. I was loved by everyone. I was enrolled into these all boys Christian schools until high school until college. I was the class clown until somewhere in middle school.

Suddenly, I was molested in a mall by some old dude, I knew what was happening but I didn't care at the time, it was in 4th grade I believe. The same thing happened again in 5th grade by another stranger, perhaps I was way too social and friendly? It didn't help that one of my classmates one day proceeded to hug me from behind and kiss my neck, this was before any of us reached puberty, and it's an all boys school. I don't know..

Middle school came, my voice broke before most of my friends, I also put braces on, so I grew much more self conscious, but I was still friendly and bubbly dude. Somewhere along middle school everyone was a sexually frustrated prepubescent in an all boys school. The amount of boys who told me they loved me and tried to kiss me was three, one of them grabbed his erect penis in front of me and grabbed my ass. I was repulsed and frustrated at the time, still am, why was that happening to me? Were they fapping to me like I was fapping to my neighbor's daughter? I was not a feminine boy at all. I was just too friendly and got along with everyone..

Fast forward high school, my confidence went down, I simply tried to avoid attention, I sat in the back, kept to myself and stopped being friendly, possibly because my self conscious told me friendliness leads to situations like above.

Right now I'm in college, mixed college, I have dealt with girls before, it's just that.. my self esteem is still in ruins.. but I want to be social and happy again. I want to actually connect with another human being, but I've just built so many walls, I have no idea how to fix it. And what I've gone through is really fucking frustrating. The world I grew up in is just too fucking weird for me to be normal again.",09Dec2017,3

Next morning I wake up and drive home still a little drunk because I wanted to die and could have a cover if I did die. I booked an appointment with Headspace on the way home because I really need to take control of my life. 

The girl I confessed to ended up messagung me and saying shed be there if I ever need help. So thats cool. 

Unfortunately the appointment is a week away and the pain of my brain is harder than ever before. Have you ever had such toxic thoughts you literally give yourself a headache? I have. The nights are literal torture fighting the voice in my head that says to end it all. Life makes no fucking sense. Days are fine though weirdly enough. I can distract myself easily during the day.

Anyway. This other girl who I kinda like hooked up with a dude at the party i was dying at. It was an odd choice of dude so today i messaged her and asked her how that even happens. Turns out she wasnt even interested but had sex anyway because of his persistance and confidence. 

What the shit. But anyway. At most parties im either dying or stopping other people from dying. Apparently being focused on not letting people die is too nice. What the hell.

44,"And I don't know how to get past it. Worst, I know a big part of it too: the internet. It seems over the last yeasr I've found arguments/criticisms that every interest, trait, and flaw I identify with is bad in some horrible way. Not just problematic, but adolescent, whiny, pseudo-exceptional, pseudo-intellectual, fake, tryhard, or otherwise ""trying to be special"". And it's terrifying: I'm literally afraid to think or feel sometimes, remembering, ""ONly whiny teenagers feel like that"" or ""But that's wrong because xyz"" where ""that"" is something emotional or otherwise non-verifiable.

That's the other part of it: some major changes in beliefs. I bat between science and spirituality a lot, have always been at least a little spiritually inclined, to the point of dabbling in or reading stuff I really don't believe in (psychicism, astrology, mostly just read or listen to the occasional thing for fun), but also seeking something deeper. Except, according to the internet and some big name scientists, comedians, writers, and more, naturalistic wonder is all you need, alternative everything is complete nonsense, all you need is critical thinking to reject anything remotely spiritual at all! I don't believe that, and more serious reading has convinced me a lot of early people had it right - faith of some kind doesn't necessarily mean just sitting around, thinking ""isn't the world cool? Isn't life mysterious?"" or gaping at something that invokes awe. A mechanistic interest can coincide with a belief in a creator, or an adjacent belief in some spiritual element within that same physical thing. Good luck, me, trying to hold onto this view when people can so confidently mock, ""disprove"" or criticize anything they disagree with. 

I feel lost in multiple ways. Lonely, adrift, no goals, nothing to care about or believe in (even in a secular manner, which I'd probably take over spiritual faith I can never quite sufficiently hold).

46,So I was sitting in the passenger seat of a car and we pulled out of an alley to make a right turn in a residential zone. Some idiot was going 40 mph (with a stop sign literally 50 feet in front and 100 feet behind) on the WRONG FUCKING SIDE OF THE ROAD. If my driver didn’t brake as fast or pulled out a second earlier I would literally be dead right now. Jesus Christ my heart is beating fast,09Dec2017,9
47,"I just turned 23 today. I have met a lot of people in the past year, I thought I had great times with them, I even got pretty close with a lot of them, some I even attended their parties and others I even bought them gifts and about 6 of my friends have reached out to say happy birthday to me. My family isnt doing anything for my birthday, just like every other year. Two of my friends want to go out for it but I dont want to, I just feel so worthless.

I have brought it up many times on reddit and I have spoken to friends and counselors but I still feel worthless. I have had such shitty dating experiences where I have been lead on and just used for attention. Every other girl I was interested in has just rejected me or lead me on even if we never even went on a date. I have never been in a relationship or really have done anything past making out with a girl and this is killing me inside.

I have so much more going on with my head with the last girl I dated and a guy I thought was a friend, that still bothers me after a year and I am stuck seeing them together, happy as ever every day at school. The older I get the more of a red flag I become to girls since I have no experience. I am told by girls who know me that Im someone girls want to settle down with years down the road, not someone they want to be with in their 20s. I have been disregarded in such an insulting way when a girl found out through a friend that I was a virgin. 

I could go on and on but the bottom line is my birthday doesnt matter. I feel worthless that I will never be man enough for someone to want. That nothing will ever make me forget about how I have been treated as a joke by other girls just so they can have attention and give another guy what I thought we were working towards. I wish I had had at least one meaningful relationship by now in my life. My friends have been in relationships, are in one now, or are having fun and hooking up left and right.

My dad and guy relatives have brought up how they have dated than when they were younger than me, my teen brother in high school has had relationships, my mom always jokes about me having a girlfriend that I dont want to bring around and she makes excuses up when people ask if Im seeing anyone. Everyone is able to get into relationships, function so well around people, I just feel so worthless.

I can see that I am not good enough, if I was anyone else, if I was better than I could have ended up with a girl who treated me like crap, or rejected me. But I never will be, Im just never going to be good enough for any girl to want me and the older I get, the lonelier I see I am, the more I see how much I failed at what I wanted. I hate school, I dont care about my degree, I dont care about the job I have lined up, its all just so I dont end up homeless. But thats all that matters though right? Thats supposed to make me happy and fulfilled right? Im supposed to overlook all the stuff that makes me feel like shit every day that gets rubbed in my face and forget about the past that showed me how worthless I am right?

Happy Birthday to worthless me.",09Dec2017,7
48,"Since you make it near to impossible for the general public to voice their opinions concerning your coverage, I have come here to vent. One can only call between the hours of 10-11 am, or 3 to 4 pm to make a complaint, your website magically won't accept comments or emails and your reddit is locked and set to private. So again, here I am. Posting to self and I doubt anyone will see this, but I need to speak my mind. 

Today you reported on A STUFFED TOY and it's trip to the emergency room. As one of the many Americans left behind after ObamaCare and as one of the Americans even more terrified of Trumps idea on how health care should be handled, as one of the many Americans in this country who are scared of debtors jail or being harrassed by debtors as a result of trips to the emergency room most of us can not afford:

Just how much money, did the family of this stuffed toy, have to pay for this thing to be wheeled into a surgery room, have it's arm sewed back on and be bandaged? None you say? Because if it was a real person? The time it took to film that segment, would have cost someone without insurance thousands of dollars. The bandages alone go for about 50 bucks an application, sometimes more. Do you all realize how offensive this is, to those of us that did not fit into the Obama health care plan? The plan that forces us to pay out of pocket for a doctors visit while also being fined once a year because our state decided not to expand medicare under said plan? Which is already being royally screwed by our current regime and making it worse for people like myself?

Some of us are actually dying and have been turned away from life saving treatments. The minutes taken to film what you thought would be a heartwarming story? Could have saved someones life, that couldn't afford the care. The fact that a hospital was willing to play along, shows just how much no one cares past their own self interest. This is not a cute Christmas story. This IS a slap in the face to every American charged thousands of dollars for bags of purified saltwater and some bandaides. 

Maybe report on that, so people can make informed decisions the next time the vote comes around. To the family who felt the need to coddle their daughter by having a doll rushed to the emergency room  and to the hospital staff that complied? Shame on you. I bet yall paid more attention to that doll, than the homeless veteran with the heart condition.
 

When I was a kid and I lost a toy? My Mother played doctor and sewed it back together. I'm physically sick to my stomach that life saving resources were used on a stuffed toy and it's all on film. Monitors, hospital supplies even a candy striper and a wheel in gurney were used. Again, that would have cost thousands of dollars for an actual uninsured patient. SO no really, how much did this family pay, for the resources the rest of us are overcharged for? Did the doll have health insurance? Or did this family and the hospital just waste resources and money? When Cancer patients ADULT OR CHILD, are being turned away from treatment, due to supposed lack of funding in hospitals, every resource counts. A doll with a missing arm?

NOT A PRIORITY. But still got better care and attention than someone at deaths door. AND MEDIA COVERAGE TO BOOT.

Sickening. 

For anyone interested, the CBS headline reads Elf On The SHelf Rushed To Hospital (after family dog rips i'ts arm off), theres a youtube video and video on their website. I can't link from my gaming console. which is also why my grammar and spelling sucks. Game controllers are not keyboards. Anyway that's my rant and I'm sticking to it. Thanks for reading.

PS: Elf on The Shelf is creepier than an Orwell Novel. Stop teaching your kids that being spied on is normal. ",09Dec2017,7
49,"So, i'm a 23yo female of Vietnamese descent, born&amp;raised in Poland, with a French education. I studied Applied Linguistics English-Spanish in France for 2 years and graduated after my 3rd year as an Erasmus student in Seville, Spain. This means I speak Polish, Vietnamese, English, French and Spanish fluently. 

I chose Applied Linguistics by default, because at 18 I had no idea what i wanted to do, and since I always had a ""talent"" with languages, I figured why not. I wouldn't say it was the worst choice of my life, but almost. I mostly regret choosing France as the country for my studies, and ESPECIALLY going to a public French university.

Anyway, after I got my bachelor, I was even more confused and too afraid to make a choice for a master so I postponed my studies and decided to try teaching English as a foreign language. I went to London for a month and got a CELTA certificate, which allowed me to teach for a year in France and Spain. I enjoyed the experience but I realised that teaching is not a career for me. 

So here I am, at my 2nd year of break from studies, working in Customer Service for Airbnb in Barcelona (at least I'm in the city that I love), still completely lost, asking redditors for career advice. 

I would like to find a master in one of these fields: Event Planning, Tourism, Hospitality, Management but it seems rather hard because my bachelor is quite unrelated and they often ask for people who have bachelors in Business/Management etc. so my question is if you have any idea if in Europe I can get a 1 or 2 year diploma/certificate (like a PGD) that would help me get a sense of the field with a lot of practice in the work environment. For now, I'd like to try working planning events, something that always interested me but for a few years I also dreamt of opening my own business (cafe/restaurant). I would ideally stay in Spain to study, but I think it's time for me to prioritize my future rather than my actual comfort/personal preferences. 

This career path confusion has made me feel down about myself, and very self-conscious. I keep comparing myself to my friends or people from the French school who are Architects, Photographers, Hotel Managers, and other highly respected positions and I'm exactly where I was at 18 - lost and afraid to make a fucking decision. I can't help wondering what my life would be if I kept on playing the piano and went to a music school (I used to play for 7-8 years but stopped during my rebellion adolescence period), what if I studied Photography, what if I chose a good private school in an English speaking country instead...The worst thing is that I am aware of the fact that I'm wasting my potential, but I'm not quite sure where my potential lies. Sometimes I feel like I could become so many things and so much more than what I am right now, but I'm just extremely self-conscious and scared that by making life-changing decisions, I'll fail (which is paradoxical because I'm failing by NOT making any decisions at all and not moving forward). I don't know why its so hard for me to just make a choice.",09Dec2017,2

The only moral foundation I wasn't lower in than both conservatives and liberals was harm. Makes sense since the values I hold dearest are freedom/bodily autonomy, truth, openmindedness tempered with critical thinking, and compassion. But I'm seriously questioning myself as to whether I'm a bad person or not. Yeah, when I was trying to practice online persuasion I couldn't bring myself to use dismissive personal attacks against somebody for their opinion, but I'm pro-abortion and pro-euthanasia and don't think guns should be banned to stop mass shootings since they are rare enough that it doesn't seem worth it. All the people I know with ""normal"" morals aren't better people than me though. They support shit I find reprehensible. But it goes the other way too. Who's to say who's right, though?",09Dec2017,1
