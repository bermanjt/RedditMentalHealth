1,"So, I started following a girl on Instagram, I dm her and got no reply. After a while I saw her three/four times in public, because she’s friend with my best friend’s girlfriend. I don’t remember really good if she was actually looking at me or not, I’m a bit paranoid and shy, and after I last saw her she followed me on Instagram, without me liking her photos etc. Do I actually have a chance with this girl or she’s just out of my league?

P.s. this girl i think is very beautiful and perfect but she’s too much for a guy like me",02Jul2017,0
7,"I've been researching my family history, and I found a lot of interesting stuff. I'm guessing a lot of its untrue, especially some crazy drinking stories, but its been worthwhile. Its kind of interesting how much this general with the same last name as me achieved, to the point where people are still writing wikipedia articles on him 200 years later, and I'm just an underachieving college student whos biggest ambition is to eventually move to another state some time in my life.

8,"My dad just passed away, 10 minutes before I was going to arrive at my parents place.  
Fuck.

I was looking forward to giving him a hug. I was excited to see his face, and the smile he'd have when he saw me. After all, the last time we were with each other was during Christmas break. Unfortunately, his cancer robbed him of a great bit of vitality, and because of that, I got home to a fucking corpse.

He had a trach tube installed a few weeks ago so he could breathe properly, so he could only talk with a voice valve. He still talked with me when I called, though. I'm just glad that I got to say ""I love you"" to him last Sunday. Too bad I never thought to record any of these.

This hurts. I was not prepared to say goodbye to my dad this early in life. On the other hand, it was an inevitability. You do 3 years of chemo and radiation, hoping that the poisons will kill the carcinomas faster than the body itself, but you're still poisoning the body. It fucking hurts. He was getting morphine shots multiple times daily for the pain, but it just wasn't enough.

I took this week off to spend time with my family and friends. I didn't know I'd be getting ready for a god dammed funeral. My head hurts. My heart hurts. I don't want to sleep, I don't want tomorrow to start without my dad.

15,"I was catching up on a TV show the other night and one episode struck a deep chord in me. The main character narrated:

&gt;“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”


After the episode was over, I reread the passage and took a long moment of reflection. I thought of each fig in my life. Would I be working and living in the city or the suburbs, or save and travel the world. Where will I be, and what do I truly want. Would I want to live to an old age?

My mind then wandered to my relationships with everyone, past and present. Friendships, dates, strangers, and family; the threads that formed between them and me. A few months ago, I had an itch to return to play an MMO. I haven't touched one in years, but I just wanted to satisfy that urge. Instead of abruptly quitting later, I encountered a great group and community. Hours and hours spent not just playing the game, but getting know them. Just recently I've stopped playing and attempted to keep in touch. Yet, it isn't the same, not at all. Like friends from high school and university, cousins and family, I've already became estranged to them.

18,"Self is along my favorite places on reddit, so I thought I'd come here. 

My GF and I just broke up our year long relationship. It was her that got the ball, she had really 'good' arguments why we have been lying to ourselves how good we're doing. I see that now, and it socks so hard. We split up very amicable and cried together, but man that does not matter now. 

I actually had to agree with her, I'm a little bit too happy go lucky when it came to the future. She is an awesome and great gal, we practically grew up together and went through those awfully confusing early twenties, alway being each other's rocks. But we came to a point where it's gotten too comfortable, and you can't grow when it's all safe. And we both need to grow. 

Im going to stop typing now, or I will continue till I have 20 pages. This feels terrible, Jesus. Can't even imagine how much I will miss her. We're also living together, which makes it even harder. Dammit, I wish I knew how this felt, which I realize now is just the kind of comfortable I should not be embracing.

E: thank you all for the kind comments! We are never going to meet, but I know there's a face to all of you and I appreciate everyone taking the time to read this and type some uplifting words. I'll be okay. Not yet, but I will be. ",02Jul2017,466
21,"(Or subreddit recommendations).


In February I applied for an internship. I didn't get the job but they showed a genuinely strong interest in my application. 

They were deciding between me and another candidate and they made the choice in the last minute. 

For you to have an idea, the result was supposed to be shared on an Friday. At the end of that day they asked me for more time because they were still deciding, they would share the result on the following Monday. 

On Saturday afternoon though I received  this email:


""Please respond to the following all by yourself (don't ask others :): How do you like to be managed? Second question: how do you approach problems in your projects? Thanks.""

Which I replied.


On Monday night I got this email:


""you are one of two great final candidates and choosing wasn't easy. Both of you would be great. However, at this stage we have offered the internship to the other candidate. Unless he doesn't accept or something in the process goes wrong, this would be the end of the process for this internship. I hope we can stay in touch with you for potential other opportunities in the future.""


Alright, so I thanked and asked how I could keep track of new opportunities. They told me:


""I will pass on your application to the IT team, while I also encourage you to regularly check in with me, to make sure you stay on my radar :) Every 4 months?"".


Here we go. Four months have passed. 
How should I approach them?


Thanks in advance.


ps.: it's a good company in New York City and I am from Brazil. The other candidate who got selected is also from South America according to what they told me. In case it is relevant to know.",02Jul2017,2

23,"Long, rambly post incoming. Throwaway account. On mobile etc. Feel free to give advice or comments if you want to. 

3 years wasted. 
3 years thinking that we will be forever. 
3 years thinking we were building a future. 
3 years thinking we were on the same track
3 years thinking how similar we are in so many ways 
3 years believing everything you told me even though it was mostly lies. 


Now I'm sitting here thinking about how little I have and how worthless I am and how I'll die alone. 


I don't have hobbies. I like shopping... That's about it. I dabble in gaming. But not ""real gaming"" I've been told, the sims, zelda, Nintendo.. Just for fun now and then. 
 I don't find dancing or sports or gardening interesting. I'm not into anything that can be done as a group to meet people which is all I keep getting told to do. I'm introverted. I'm shy. I don't like big groups of people. I don't drink, I don't go clubbing or to pubs. I don't have any single friends. I'm limited to online dating sites and I got played on that last time. 


I'm 29, I'm female, I'm not the best looking thing out there but I'm not the worst I guess. I have a good job, no kids. I'm in a small city, the dating pool sucks, why did you have to tick all the boxes except the most important - honesty. 

You cheated on me and I forgave you. More than once. How stupid am I. 

You just didn't turn up to my birthday and I forgave you. That would have saved two years if I'd paid attention to the red flags then. 

I'm a fool. 

Why did you have to lie from day one about so much stupid crap..why?! Your birthday, why would you lie about that? I still don't understand.  And why did I put up with it. 


After 3 years and so many promises to change, nothing has or will. We have no photos together. I've never been to your house. I've never met your family or friends. We've never spent a night together. Three years and you wouldn't commit to changing any of those things beyond more empty promises. 


All my friends hate you and have hated you since they met you because of your behaviour. But I looked past it, I thought I knew you and it was just a bad impression. It wasn't. 


I thought you were meant to fight for the ones you love. To work to make relationships work. But people tell me it's not meant to be like this. Not a constant fight where I give in to your way. Where I let you off the hook for everything because you can manipulate me so well. 

So now I'm the one who has ended it and im the one sitting here crying. I'm the one feeling like a worthless piece of crap. I'm the one upset and I know you'll just go back online and find someone new and that kills me. The thought of you with someone else makes me feel sick. Physically. Even though I'm the one who ended things. 

I'll probably end up doing it too, going online, eventually I guess, finding guys who say they want a relationship but really only want sex. I'll be used again like last time I was online before I met you. And I'm not into the hookup culture and never have been. But I guess I have to take what I can get. That's all I deserve. 

What if you are the one. What if. I guess I'll never know. Because I can't talk to you because you'll just talk me around again and make the same empty promises you have time and time again, which you don't keep and we fight about again and you make promises again and the cycle continues. But I can't do it anymore. It's too hard. It's too much. 


I'm not good enough for you to introduce me to your friends and family. 3 years and we have only been out in daylight once together. 3 years and really i only know you like basketball and where you work and that you're a picky eater who doesn't drink coffee. 
3 years and we spent most of our time in a gaming room at a pub. After 11 when you had finished with seeing your friends for the night. 

3 years and you know everything about me and have met everyone in my life and I know nobody in yours. 


3 years of my hanging next to the phone waiting for you to call or text. 3 years of my friends getting frustrated because I'd leave them mid conversation to answer the phone when you'd call so you don't get angry. 3 years and you never ever answered any of my calls to you. 

I have all of my friends (all four of them, really, that's all I have) supporting me and telling me I've done the right thing. Reminding me of the crap you've put me through. Reminding me of the talks we've had about how you could possibly even be sociopathic given the ease in your lying, how you are only interested in yourself. About how my wants are dismissed for yours. How I always came last in your life behind work, your friends, basketball and then me. 

But all I can think about is the good times. The times you were there for me when I needed to talk. The times you came to me when I had a bad day and just needed a hug and to cry on your shoulder. The anniversary night you planned. The way you could make me laugh with such ease, no matter what was going on. You could always make me laugh, could talk me around. But it's so hard to see the bad things right now sitting here crying over you knowing you probably don't care. 

And knowing I'll probably end up dying alone because I don't deserve better than you and I doubt I'll find it.

24,"Hey Reddit, 
I have a lot of trouble dealing with regret and anger. I've made quite significant mistakes in my life that will affect me for the next few years and I have a lot of trouble coping with them. I also have issues that were out of my control completely (due to other people/actions) and will affect me for probably the rest of my life. As for the anger, it's not like I lash out at anyone or anything like that, it's really just internal anger that becomes sadness and back to anger. I just can't seem to stop this cycle and I'm getting pretty tired of it. I run frequently and play tennis to take my mind off these things but it only cools me for about an hour and I'm back to thinking about these mistakes/people/ and events that have occurred in my life. I really don't feel like going to a therapist because I imagine that should I speak about the specifics to a professional, it would have the same effect as running does to me. I imagine that speaking would only slightly cool me down for a bit and then I'm back to having this battle in my mind at all hours of the day. I know I said I'm against talking and that's exactly what im doing here, but was wondering if there's anything that works for people who have a similar situation. ",02Jul2017,1

31,"I [26F] have dealt with very low self esteem since I was about 11/12 years old. I basically track it back to when I started becoming aware of my body and how physical attractiveness = more positive attention. 

When I was about 12 years old I began developing an eating disorder (specifically purging disorder) have suffered with it for the whole of my teens and young adult life. I haven't purged in 8 months (a record and huge victory for me) but I am still dealing with immense self worth issues. 

I find it very difficult to find value in myself outside of my appearance and obsess over it. I loathe the way I look because I feel like I'm not 100% perfect. 

This also deeply affects my relationship with my boyfriend and I find myself being exceptionally envious of other women and feel threatened all the time. (This is a very basic explanation. It is much more intense than just normal jealously)

I have realized that I derive most of my value off the approval of men and I think that approval can only be gained from being physically attractive.

I lash out intensely for no reason because I feel such a deep hatred for myself sometimes and I don't know how to deal with that feeling. 

If I had to look at the facts on paper I have no reason to feel this way. I am conventionally attractive, thin, successful in my job and well educated. But I have never been able to bring myself to connect with those facts and I am drawn to self deprecation and self hatred. At my core I feel like an exceptionally flawed failure.

Basically all I want to know is if anyone has any advice on healing a terrible self worth? 

The unfortunate part is that I am unable to afford therapy. No insurance plan in my country will cover it for me either. I have been to therapy before and it was incredible, and is obviously the top prize here, but right now it is not viable.

Are there any tools I can find online? Perhaps any helpful workbooks? Or if anyone just has some me solid advice? I really need something practical I can work with daily.

Thank you kindly xx",02Jul2017,12
33,"Title is pretty self explanatory. Been non diagnosed depressed for maybe 4 years. Constant suicidal ideation, everyday I just keep thinking shooting myself in the head. The voice in my head (Not like schizophrenic voice but just my inner monologue is just constantly betraying and bringing me down.) I can't tell which thoughts are lies or the truth. My birthday is in a week. I'll be 26. 

I'm perpetually alone and pushing most any friends I've had away. I'm a bad friend. I don't actually care about anyone but myself. Jealous of their lives' and successes. 

I've become a bad son, grandson, and brother. I don't have real conversations with my family anymore. They want to see me succeed. They want to see me happy but none of them have ever come out and asked if I am happy but to be fair I'm not interested in deep conversations, I like to keep things superficial. I take and I take and then I go too long without seeing or even calling them because I'd rather just lay in bed all day. 

 I've failed professionally. Went to school for an absolutely idiotic degree, now I work in retail and for a bar. I like the company I work for but they're not at all interested in me. I've been passed up for pretty much every position I've tried to move up. I know I should just give up and find any fulltime job at an insurance, bank, or utility company but I just can't bring myself to. 

Not to mention I'm constantly numbing myself with weed, from the moment I get up in the morning until I pass out at night. Not exactly conducive to finding a real person job. I used to take great pride in my work ethic but now I just feel myself floating through the day, uninterested in what I'm doing or the people around me. 

Still a virgin at 26. 

How the fuck did that happen?

I see beautiful women constantly while working at the bar. Even just seeing them makes me feel worse. Every woman I see I just think about how they're completely out of my league and that they don't even see me, barely register my existence. I still get crushes every once in a while but I do everything in my power to suppress them to avoid eventual, inevitable disappointment. 

I think about suicide everyday. I don't actively harm myself but it's been a long time since I've really taken care of myself. I know the things I need to do to get better but I can't bring myself to do them. 

I think deep down I like being depressed because it's my excuse to be selfish and lazy. To not have to talk about my problems. To not have to face the real world. To just wander listlessly until I'm dead and don't have to worry about these things. To not have to feel this deep ache. To not feel like a disappointment to everyone around me me. 

I'm just waiting for a turning point for better or worse. I feel myself actively looking for things that make me feel worse. I feel like I want a breaking point. The only thing that holds me back is how badly it would hurt my family. I think that's why I'm trying to drift away from them, to make them upset with me so eventually I'll have nothing stopping me. 

Mostly I just want this pain to go away. I just want to start over again to try to avoid all these fucking mistakes. ",02Jul2017,2

I don't wake up in terror, so it never really bothered me. But something unusual happened in the past year. I became good friends with someone who made me comfortable enough to talk freely about my past traumas. We've both had it pretty rough, so we formed a good bond.
