1,"I mean maybe it makes a good story since it's so relateable and it probably happens to everyone once, but it's fucking unhealthy to make people think this way. The typical 'guy is friends with girl, has secret feelings for her but she's taken, she realises her feelings for him and they get together' cliché bullshit plot is fucking stupidly portrayed as if it has some kind of happy ending. I'm in this position right now, and it doesn't have one. 

What happens in real life? You're friends with a girl. One day you wake up and realise that shit, you feel more than just that towards her. You know she has a boyfriend so you bury it the fuck away. But the more you try do that the more the shit just grows and grows and eats away at you. You live a constant paradox of wanting to logically distance yourself to save emotions getting in the way, and being so intoxicated by being around her that you end up spending every moment you can with her anyway. You tell yourself you're a piece of shit for not just being able to accept being friends with her. You feel awful that you're so damn close with someone else's girlfriend. You feel like a sleazy little piece of shit but when you're around her none of that matters. 

You're faced with three choices really, none of them good. You can tell her how you feel and see how things go. In the movies this shit goes great but in real life you're just throwing a spanner in a close friend's relationship. You can stop talking to her, but then you're losing a good friend just because you can't control your emotions, and you're gonna spend an incredible amount of time wishing you could just be around her again. Or, third, you keep talking to her everyday like you two have always done, finding new reasons to fall for her every damn day and feeling like a fucking fool for letting yourself fall this hard for someone you're not gonna end up with. If you're an especially bitter and insecure dude who's fell for this shit you're gonna end up complaining about the friendzone and how her boyfriend's a dick and you're the one who treats her nice. These guys have been made to think one day this shit's gonna change, but it never will and instead they just end up being toxic people. If you're not like this and try to just continue as normal you're just gonna feel fucking miserable cause you know deep down its never gonna be enough. As long as you keep being around her so much you're never gonna get over her. Even though you love every minute you spend with her, in the time you're not around her you'll spend every moment thinking about her and hoping somehow shit changes, while knowing realistically it won't. You know deep down you're waiting for a moment that's never gonna come along, but you just can't help yourself. It's the most bittersweet shit there is.

Truth is it doesn't have a happy ending, and fuck Hollywood for making anyone out there think it does man. Having feelings for a close friend who's in a relationship is a fucking messy, messy situation in the real world.",28Sep2017,1
2,"On Antifa, specifically [here](https://news.vice.com/story/veteran-berkeley-protester-to-antifa-try-to-be-braver).

The thing is for decades in this country the only action antifa was ever involved in was 100% fringe, ignored by everyone, and seen almost universally in the mainstream as a destructive nuisance (if they were seen at all).  The only eyes they had to evade were fascists and the state protecting fascists, and to them that made the decision obvious.  There was no ""optics"", they were unseen to the political class.  They were doing what they did on principle, and out of desperation.

If today's liberals want to see less violence, you have to get between antifa and the fascists, and you have to put your backs to antifa.  That's how a principled pacifist forces their pacifism on others in protest - know who's right, know that nonviolence is more important, and be willing to sacrifice anything to make peace.  The people you're dealing with aren't going to listen to scathing criticism from the Atlantic.  They might listen to a veteran protestor - they might decide that showing their faces really does build their credibility (among a class historically... unfriendly to them...) even if they change nothing else about their behavior.  

But if you want to stop them you have to get there willing to take what they're willing to take.

And if the nonviolent part doesn't work out for you when the fascists press in, don't worry- antifa's got your back.",28Sep2017,0

9,"Never pictured myself in a fraternity. Too much conformity, not enough independence. Was told to go rush and I figured I'd get out of my comfort zone and go meet a bunch of strangers by myself. 

Wasn't a bad time, two hours flew by. But, out of everyone I talked to, I only connected to maybe 3-4 of them. Everyone I talked to was chill, most of them didn't seem to care when I was talking; which might be understandable cause they see a lot of rushees. 

At the end of the night, one of them asked me to come back tomorrow. Not sure if I'm going to.

I don't see myself getting anything out of fraternity other than ""lifelong"" bonds with your fraternity brothers. But how true is this? 

I already have party people and go to parties. 
I already have an internship and network with people in the profession I'm getting into.
I can give back to the community and do philanthropic work on my own. 


So, there's really no reason for me to go back tomorrow, if not for making more friends. Which, again, was only with a few people out of the many I talked to. 

Any other reasons to go tomorrow?

20,"Last night, I couldn't sleep for the third consecutive night due to the jock itch I've been struggling with. For those that don't know, it's essentially a yeast infection on a dudes balls that itches and burns like you wouldn't believe. It's not a serious condition and it's very common, but that doesn't make it any less miserable to deal with. 

As I laid in bed, unable to sleep because my balls were on fire, I started to Google ways to make it stop hurting. I already have a cream to get rid of the fungus prescribed to me by a doctor, but that doesn't get rid of it immediately, and I needed a way to relieve the itch and pain now. I drive to Walmart, as it's the only place open at 2 am. While
I'm there, I'm looking on my phone for ways to dull the pain. And I find a solution that sounds like exactly what I need, something that doesn't cure the jock itch, but just provides temporary relief: Listerine. So, I'm supposed to put Listerine on my nuts, let it sit for a few minutes, then clean it off. I buy it, and head home. 

At this point, it's about 3 in the morning, my girlfriend and puppy are sleeping, so I head to the bathroom to do my thing. I get a cotton pad, put some Listerine on that baby, and lather up my balls. It took roughly 3 seconds for me to regret every decision in my life. It felt like my balls were dipped in the Arctic Ocean, while simultaneously being burned with a blow torch. I grabbed a towel to muffle my screams (closer to whimpers, really) and tough it out for two minutes. As soon as the two minutes were up, I washed and dried my balls, and what do you know, they hardly itched at all! Not gonna lie, though, standing in my bathroom at 3 am whimpering into a towel because I just covered my already burning balls with Listerine was a pretty low point in my life. 

TL;DR Had jock itch that wouldn't let me sleep. Put Listerine on my nuts to make the itch go away, which lead to the most harrowing two minutes of pain in my life. But I'd definitely do it again. ",28Sep2017,395

I don't deserve to be alive. I don't *want* to be alive. I'm not depressed--I have been diagnosed with clinical depression before, and this is not it, this does not feel how I felt then. It's just the sheer truth that the world would be much better off without me in it, and I certainly wouldn't have to keep living my pathetic, draining existence. The issue is, I'm kind of a terrible person. Most importantly, I'm a coward. I'm not brave enough to do it alone, I need someone to hold my hand and tell me it's okay while I relieve them of my burdensome existence. But of course no one will do that. They feel like they have to ""save"" my ""precious life"" because that's what society has told them, even though I can tell they all wish I had never entered their lives in the first place. My life is not precious or worth saving. I would know. But I'm too much of an awful coward to bring mercy on the poor world that has to deal with me. I hate that my only options are to OD or shoot myself or bleed or whatever completely alone, or continue inflicting my existence on a world that shouldn't have to deal with me. There are so many resources out there that will try to convince you not to kill yourself or save you when you get close, but where are the services for weak motherfuckers like me who *should* die but are too weak to do it alone?

30,"But no, there's me but to be fair this one was the most convincing yet, namely because this time ""she"" had come equipped with her own entire Facebook profile with a collection of almost 3,000 photos of the same girl. Oh, did I mention she doesn't have a Microphone?

Ah the good old days, circa 4 years ago. Back when there weren't common knowledge methods for anti-catfishing like the tried and true shoe on your head or some other unflattering, completely random scenario that one couldn't possibly find a photo of.

The scene is fairly generic, guy meets ""girl"" on an Online video game but this time the entire guild was also under the exact same impression. Something about this particular girl seemed wayy too good to be true but nobody was going to turn around and admit it especially when she can link you a Facebook profile with several thousand photo uploads dating back years.

The guild was the ""1%""-ers on the server, we saw ourselves as practical gods among peasants but I for one saw myself rise above and beyond that. I played a Tank (the only true Tank class in the game) and it was public knowledge that I had recently my static (That's just gamer talk for someone you regularly group with) healer which left a void in my world. I had in possession my healer's login credentials, but this wasn't publicly known at all and I was very much so just caretaking the account and ""keeping the seat warm"" while ""she"" was away (Yes, this is probably yet another Catfish but it's less interesting than this one).

So, one day rolls along and all of a sudden our Catfish suddenly logs back into the game after taking an extended period of leave from the game without explanation. My Guild leader at the time is evidently head over heels for her just as much as I was, the difference was I had a much greater vested interest as she also plays a healing class. I have the leg up on him and he knows it but for our story's sake, there's not much else to flesh out here.

There are few bonds stronger in online gaming than that that exists between the group's Tank and Healer. I'm limited by how much the healer can put out, but they're also limited by how much I can take. There's a large degree of trust that goes both ways, so much so that there are few other relationships that are as symbiotic in the entire group or raid. This is only further deepened by the fact that there's also usually only 1 tank but multiple healers (usually) with one dedicated or at least primarily responsible healer for the tank (This differs from game to game but in this particular game, and on this particular content, this was the case).

So, with that out of the way, I think you can see where this is going hopefully if I've explained things clearly enough without losing too many people. I end up providing the Catfish my static healer's account login credentials (a big no no, both socially and is usually against Terms of Service, probably because GameMasters can't be bothered policing this bullshit). When Catfish logs into my healer, it's drawing a lot of attention because as I said earlier, it was fairly publicised (read forum post) that my static healer was going to be taking time away from the game indefinitely. 

My guild leader's not stupid, he quickly see's what's going on and has added one and one together and gotten two rather quickly. I'm spending a lot of time with Catfish alone, in Teamspeak in my private channel and away from the rest of the 50-60 other people in the guild. This along with the coincidence of my healer suddenly returning back to life is starting to attract the attention of others but I got the impression at the time that nobody really wanted to say anything.

It's around this time that we add each other on Facebook, and oh boy did she look Instagram model level pretty. She claimed to be of Korean nationality but born and raised in LA which to my understanding was fairly common. This remained consistent with her ability to just simply type in Korean which sealed the deal for me without ever making me wonder how difficult it would be to just simply copy and paste in Korean phrases into chat.

Her Facebook was immaculate, with in excess of several thousand Photos of her. So many I couldn't even be bothered going past the first few hundred as after a while it all just kind of blurred together. It was evident that she was older than I was but I didn't care, I was a teenager at the time and to me I had frankly just hit the fucking jackpot with this.

Aanyway, that's enough backstory I feel to cover what happens next in the story and how we start cracking apart the web of deceit and lies. So, time has passed between the last paragraph and where we are here. It's been about 4-5 months to be almost entirely precise. Now, going back to one of my previous points about being in a fairly large guild of 1%-ers.

The guild itself had expanded in the last few months, welcoming more and more people into the guild, if this was a business it would be a very good sign with a very low turnover rate. As such you had these smaller groups form within the guild and so even though we were in the same guild, you would get instances where there were just people you had never met before or came into contact with as you were just on entirely different cliques. 

Out of the blue, I got a seemingly random mail from a guildy one day. It was someone I kinda knew but her source was someone in the guild who I absolutely didn't know so I was skeptical at first. But what he had to say was pretty groundbreaking, he actually met the person in Catfishes photo in person on several occasions and was mutual friends with her.

Sure enough, when I was linked the ""actual"" Facebook profile it was of the exact same girl, this time with almost 8,000 photos of herself. Someone who clearly had a huge online identity and could easily be targeted in such an attack as all of her photos were available to the public, you didn't even need to be this person's friend to access them all but I could only imagine you'd probably get even more if you were.

After a quick and short expose on Catfish went dark rather quickly, leaving the account and never to be seen again, deleting their facebook profile after we'd contacted law enforcement. I managed to get a word in to the ""actual"" girl in the photos and said she should probably do something about this but I never heard back aside from a few OMG's and the genral kind of response you'd expect to receive in this situation.

Soon after to save face both and the guild leader both kinda went our own ways, I left the guild soon after this all took place as it was fairly apparent that I had fucked up and probably compromised the otherwise few relationships I had left in the guild. It turned out to be for the best though as I managed to land myself a spot in an even more exclusive guild which had very few people in it.

Anyway, if you've made it this far I thank you because I've just had this one on my chest for a while and it came to light after I started watching some of those Catfish videos on Youtube. I thought this one would be interesting to share as the other two just weren't as compelling.",28Sep2017,3
31,"I recently went through a small break up, and I'm saying very small compared to my last one. We dated for just short of 2 months, hardly counts of anything at all, but after 4 years of being single and building myself into a better person since my last relationship I am happy to see that I am dateable again. 

My girlfriend before her I dated for 5 years, we had plans to be together forever, and then a lot of things started happening that revealed that our relationship has become slowly strained over the years and if a single line snapped the whole thing would collapse. I didn't want the same thing to happen again, and even worse I didn't want to make the same mistake I made with her: I hung onto her despite the drama and obvious toxic relationship we had because I was scared of being alone. So I spent the next couple of years making myself who I wanted to be and learn to be comfortable with who I am. A healthy relationship is supposed to enhance who you are, not define it.

So I met this girl at a party a few months back. We hit it off, and decide to officially date. She was the first girl I've been with in 4 years since I moved on. I was past the going on a few dates phase, or just simply hooking up. Then about two months in she breaks up with me, telling me that she just recently got out of a long term relationship and needs to get comfortable with herself before she's ready to commit. Having come from the same background I totally understood. I was disappointed, but I didn't love her so my heart wasn't broken, I just really liked her.

I see the amount of celebrities that are succumbing to depression openly on their social networks is rising at an alarming rate. They apologise to their followers for 'not being right yet' and announce that they will be back soon. And their fans send them messages of understanding, love and support. The kinds of messages any supporter in that position would or perhaps should say. Stock responses that anyone could have made if we were being brutally honest. And these digitised sentiments of goodwill will only have meaning if the receiver believes them. Otherwise they mean and say nothing.

With the world becoming an increasingly unbelievable place, one where augmenting reality itself has actually become a way to make a good living, is it any wonder why humans believe in less and less in these days? Belief is what grounds us in reality. It is what anchors us in a world we are constantly unsure about. When politics is been purposefully framed as drama that will quickly descend to the level of farce, what are we to believe in then? What can possibly reassure us and tell us what we need to hear?

AI - Artificial Intelligence can and will tell us what we need to hear. 

Soon the army of celebrity twitter supporters will be hordes of AI chat-bots whose responses will be attuned to the person directed and at some point you will forget that it matters that the responses used to come from living breathing creatures, because it won't matter anymore.

Idk if any of this makes sense but it's kind of a weird thing to have as I've had it for like 10+ years now.

Anybody else experience a similar thing? Or any guesses on why this happens? ",28Sep2017,2

47,"For almost exactly a year I've worked at a small company, 5 people total. It's a pretty good gig. Good hours, decent pay. The owner and 2 other guys work out of an office and me and ""my supervisor"" work together out in the field. We're all friendly, occasionally we go out drinking together after work, and things are pretty informal. We don't really have job titles, but the guy I work with is the owner's friend from high school, has been with the company from the beginning, and is definitely a step above us other three in the unspoken hierarchy. We're all white men.

Today we were talking like we usually do, and for some reason he mentions race, and that ""races are obviously different"" as a side comment to whatever we were talking about.

I'm at work so I'm not trying to start shit or get into anything touchy, because obviously we have to work together all day everyday. But I do casually disagree and say that people have different cultures but ultimately all people are the same everywhere.

He takes that as a sign that I want to debate this, and suddenly starts unloading some of the most ignorant racist things I've ever heard in my life, out of nowhere. He starts citing random statistics and drawing ridiculous conclusions, like ""black people have a lower suicide rate than 'normal people' because they're too concerned with their own survival to ever become depressed."" And that ""people aren't racist anymore, racism hasn't existed since segregation ended. Black people use that as an excuse for  being poor and causing so much crime in the cities.""

Anyway, he's throwing all these fallacies and illogical statements of ignorance at me like we're chatting about the fucking weather. I'm totally blind sided and have never had a debate like this with someone who's job description includes making sure I get paid. I'm trying to keep all my answers short and conclusive, I guess in passive hopes that he drops the subject.

After a little back and forth (of me trying to explain racism and the socioeconomic history of america as briefly and nonchalantly as possible, and him trying to either convince me that white people are the superior race or just make me angry, I'm not sure) he says, ""well I can see this kind of talk makes you uncomfortable. But one last question. How do you feel about the N word?""

I have no idea what my objective is anymore. Am I trying to prove him wrong? Am I trying to make him not racist? Am I trying to dismiss the issue as quickly as possible and pretend it never happened? I feel like I'm on the defensive here by situation, he's my supervisor. I felt like I was in high school being bullied by some huge kid who would kick the shit out of me if I said anything mean to him even though he just threw all my books on the ground.

I tell him ""I don't think anyone should use it. Race aside, that word obviously is very impactful. To use it is to presume you have a better understanding of the world than anyone and anything that has ever told you not to use it.""

He laughed and gave some more semi-coherent semi-related responses, said stuff like it's silly for new anchors to use the phrase ""n-word"" because we all know what they're talking about. He compared it to swearing around a little kid. He said there's no words in the english language that you could say to him to make him angry.

Anyway, all the while he's laughing and saying real condescending things like ""wow man you look really uncomfortable"" and ""I hope I'm not *offending* you right now"".

Ultimately I left work feeling extraordinarily defeated. I was disappointed in myself because I felt like I didn't defend my viewpoint enough, that I failed to coolly and calmly point out all his logical breakdowns. I felt humiliated for being uncomfortable instead of confident, and for him being able to see how uncomfortable I was, and for him thinking it was funny. I was angry that he interpreted me being uncomfortable as him being right. I'm angry at myself for having to choose between showing my true emotions and keeping face for my superior *and choosing to keep face for my superior*.

I'm not sure what to do now. Keep working alongside a dude I know is extremely racist? Passively start looking for a new job? Quit in a rage and hope I don't starve? Complain to my boss that his longtime friend is racist (which I'm sure he knows)?

Thanks for reading. Solutions are welcome but I'm mostly just looking to rant. If anyone has similar stories I'd love to hear them.

**TL;DR:**

My supervisor randomly wanted to debate racism in America with me today. I felt the need to suppress my true emotions on account of him being my superior and us working side by side on a daily basis, but now I feel humiliated and cowardly for letting someone argue their racist views with me and failing to properly argue against them.",28Sep2017,4
