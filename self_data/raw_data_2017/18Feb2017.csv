12,"I am terrified of being alone and I am terrified 
I am terrified that everything I do is to make people like me
Is this a desperate attempt to
I want people to seek me out
I don't /want/ it as a desire. It's more of some kind of lower, primal need
I have urges to share this. To gather social currency. Just among my friends. People I know. There is no need to seek new, unknown people
The urge to share, and the knowledge of that urge and the urge to share /that/ are looping and recursing
Do I respect the things that I do?
Every couple minutes I think the same again
I keep coming back to the same few people. The people I talk to most
Why do I want someone to ==anticipate== no not anticipate but hope for me no not hope for me just...desire me
But when people say things to me, reach out to me, I do not always 
Why do I have the urge to share this again.
I think of Angela and Josh and Nick most
Everyone I was just with doesn't matter?
I care not for their opinion yet I not have but had the anxiety about them not but a few minutes ago
Am I mad?
If I were would it be more popular?
I feel some kind of giddy excitement at the prospect of viral success
but then would I collapse
Wait, no, I'm just getting dramatic now
So I've gone from deep existential dread and insecurity to now analyzing the situation
Huh
An urge to share again, but for amusement, not out of desperate need for human contact
Did I touch some lower part of myself?
What about my job? My work?
I chose this because I ?love? it?
Those question marks are wiggly effect on the love not the question inflection in my head
I had to specify that?
What if this is how great challenging breakthrough ideas are made?
I feel like something...""new""...is coming
Am I in a prison in my head?
Am I just getting thoughts out?
Is darkness coming out of me?
Someone texted me a while ago.
I still haven't looked at who.
Probably Bri
What do I /care/ about?
Apparently not Bri?
I haven't thought of Jacquie at all either
Mainly Angela and Josh
Why?Why do I keep coming back to them?
Nick wrote me a letter, it was amazing
Am I trapped by the fear of being embarassed?
Do I need someone to talk to?
What would I say?
This will pass I hope
Is this something I am saying? Like, to the world?
For money? I mean, no, I feel like the final goal is not money
It feels like an expectation, a foregone conclusion if /something/ is done right
I keep considering opening up to someone, but how?
What would I say?
Anything I said, would lead to a prescribed action that would be a logical, reasonable, social reaction to my action. And that's exactly the problem.
It has to be spontaneous. A desire in them, never me
I have another urge to share this. And this urge to resist, that to let part of myself out would be to...to something
I have an urge to share this again
What if I die and no one ever sees this?
My face feels twisted
I have again the urge to publish. To share.
But really, what I almost want is for someone to seek it out and find it
Again, the twist of the face
Am I sick?
I mean, I took a drug
What is this that's coming out of me? Emotionally? In my head? It's like a black river
What will be left of me when it leaves?I feel that to share this is /wrong/ somehow
That it's a desire to create a false desire to do a thing for me in return
True altruism?
Is that what I desire?
No
Not altruism. Not even necessarily something good
I just want the world to notice me in a small way
A single person, spending some time devoted utterly to me
by their own initiation and desire
Even this document you are now reading, if it sparks some such desire in you for this, thereby invalidates it by having an action taken by me to make it happen
But what would I do to deserve such a thing?
On a large, cosmic scale I mean
morally
It's a dilemma
A catch 22
would people want to see this?
Maybe
People publish journals for money
they do it all the time
But I don't even want the money. Just the adoration? I want it, yet somehow it feels that if I do anything to initiate it, then it's invalid
Aside, I finally checked my phone
It was Ashley, not Bri
I had told Ashley I had a video of Spanish Web that I would send her
Then I put it on facebook
Does that make me false? A false friend? To share it with all when I said I would send it to her?
It feels suddenly like some intimacy
Again the urge to share and publish, to rack up the social credit for what I have written. As if it were anything other than the playing-out of a plan, to acquire that social credit.
Am I odd? Weird? Out of whack?
Do I like this?
I didn't before. But it now seems unreasonable to have any other way forward. So must accept it?
Do I share with only my friends? What if they tell me I should share what I have made with all? What if they lock me up?
Are these the ravings of a madman?
A twitch of my head breaks the reverie and suddenly I am better for a moment. Then it returns in a wave.
What if I die?
An urge to preserve what I have created here
I feel conceited. Because I have the feeling that I have created something great, and yet, somehow I feel like I /know/ that what I have created is not great.
There is a pulling at my brain.
This is a book about a book?
Why would I write if not to share?- is a question I am asking myself. Seriously.
I don't feel that I love this. I don't feel that I love anything.
Am I flopping between two gates?
Are these metaphors?
This is nothing but a stream of consciousness out of my head
Will anyone thing it's interesting?
Do I?
Why do I do anything?
I drink more water and the urge is sated
I have another urge to share, now with Bri, and I feel embarassed by the mention of her above
Could I share this with anyone but Angela?
I mean obviously I could and other people would read it Josh and Nick and people
Do I know anyone else who would not be offended?
Perhaps I should post it online
I kinda want to?
But how would anyone read and understand who these people I mention are?
I feel guilty for not mentioning more people. For not thinking of them?
And of course my mind flashes to all of these people
Which is most everyone I know of course
and I think, ""Why have I not thought of you before now?""
Why just my friends? Why have I not once thought of family?
It has not entered my mind
and that feels very, very bad
Was something wrong with my family?
Something about emotional support?
I don't want my parents to know
They did a great job and they shouldn't know that something was terribly wrong the whole time. It wasn't them. It was me.
I assume this will fade ad the drug wears off.
I've gotten two more texts, and some emails
I check them now
Bri's mad at me for this. My mind is bobbling between ""why do I need you?"" to the admission that she's probably right
Do I want to be alone now?
Kinda?
Does she want to be with me?
I don't know
I don't want to hurt Bri
I feel she would get upset
And she'd be all ""no shit, sherlock""
Why am I obsessed with predicting the actions of others?
Could I? But I don't want to!
I'm talking to her about you now
""this cookie is doing weird things to my head""
But can she possibly know what this is like? What you are like?
There I go, anthropomorphising you
Bri...what do I do with her? Do I not care about hurting her in the future?
My head clears again for a moment. I pee and hash my hands after more water
You know, if I ever publish this, I should probably change the names of all of my friends
I thought that for a moment
But then I realize that if they say it, they would know who they were
if I shared it with them
How could I know if I'm crazy if I don't share this with someone who knows me? who knows my life? No one who is not a part of it could possibly understand thesse chains of emotion draped around me now and I think of them
Descriptions of how they relate to me, I can do. But the strength of the emotional chains, I cannot
What if I scare everyone away from me? That's why it ought be shared anonymously
But how could anyone but those close to me ever help?
Do I build up a support network for if I fall?
Why should that be necessary? Why would I deserve to not fall forever, if I fall?
Do I seek the approval of strangers?
People to say ""jesus, dude, this is your life""?
In a cold, detatched, third-party kind of way
in awe, mind you, but still so detatched.
This feels like some kind of confession
Like I've done something wrong emotionally, and I'm figuring it all out
I am nothing, nothing at all and yet I want to be everything
I want it to be big, and to not be ridiculed
there it goes again
It feels like some kind of confession, a last treatise of me, a manifesto
Like I'm telling everyone about this horrible thing I just did
this great crime of having emotions
What will this be like to read in the morning?
Why am I who I am?
I decided to be honest when I wrote this, and the inclusion of people I know in ways that might hurt them of what I truly think of them
Should I remove those lines?
but then the text would be somehow...""incomplete""
I don't want Bri to break up with me over this?
And yet I feel these waves of detatchedness wash over me
Do I love her? Do I not?
The answer flipflops every moment
I feel pulled in both directions
this urge to mold myself to her will? I suppose that describes it for one
The other, this questioning of why I care
Has this always been inside me?
Did Jacquie do this to me?
I feel very different from earlier
When I was with my friends, obsessed with how much they did or didn't like me
So concerned with social currency
And all of it 
With Bri, I feel she's being unreasonable except also not. How do I know who is right? I mean, did she understand me? What I meant, the feeling behind what I said
There's no filter on this. I feel incompetent. Just an open human book.
Presumably everything will get better in the morning
I should sleep
I'm not sure I enjoy this
It's weird
Perhaps I should start meta-analyzing the situation again, rather than feeling the feelings
When I feel the feelings, that's when I feel the weight on me
A meta-analysis distracts me. Distracts me from the waves crashing behind my mental dikes
I think about the thinking, and the thinking blocks the feeling
Thinking is good. Feeling is therefore bad, since the latter obscures the former
I just started to write better. Interesting.
But I ask, do I deserve to not feel? Have I done anything worthy of lifting myself out of this misery? Stopping the hole in this dike, using the thinking to block the feeling?
Is this how humans progressed scientifically? To use analytical thinking to block the feelings?
It makes sense
When I am less raw, less open, I think I will likely return to the same
Do I need to change myself?
Am I a bad person?
Why have I never felt this raw?
Moving through work, all drudgery, removes me from this
I will try to sleep now, to eliminate these feelings and become my idea of normal for myself, that costume I wear
For my own good I think
For no one wants to be bad
I hope it works and I wake up restored in the morning
Good bye

13,"I was extremely shy as a kid. Didn't have many friends and couldn't relate with many people because of my immigrant background. But the one friend I had, the very closest one in my childhood, went out of his way to make sure I felt like I belonged. We always played outside together with his huge toy collection and his rather large friend group, both things I wished I had. It was beautiful childhood and really brought me to love the United States more. 

We had to go our separate ways when I moved out of state. Though we added each other on social media, we sorta lost contact. Last time I heard from him, his parents divorced, he didn't do so hot in school, and, following family tradition, joined the military. I too had my difficulties: my parents were couldn't raise me anymore and I moved in with my uncle, all with my battle with depression. The only difference from him and I was that I managed to climb out of that hole: I got a scholarship, got into one of my top universities in the best city of the world, found a career that's fulfilling, and I think I may have relationship potentially going for me. 

Recently, I made a joking Facebook post about something funny I said in class and asked my Facebook friends to share something similar experiences. Immediately I got one notification from my childhood friend. I got excited because it's been so long since we last touched base.

My excitement grew into shock as I read his comment. I don't feel like spelling it out but it was deeply homo/transphobic. He brought up some weird and vague conspiracies about ""leftist indoctrination in education"", belittling my academic achievements. He bought into the whole ""Alt-Right"" ideology and what not, probably energized by recent political events. Here was what I consider my first real friend, who went out of his way to make sure I felt welcome, now turning against me. He became what I feared most as a child: a bully. 

I'm just really depressed how absurdly confusing and cruel life is. I didn't want the image of what I constitute as a true friend to be tarnished by the image of bigotry. I won't be too harsh on him, however. I want to deeply and perhaps naively believe he is a product of his surroundings and unfortunate circumstances. I want to believe he is still that accepting and welcoming person from back then. I want to believe he is still *my friend*.",18Feb2017,16
16,"...so I have no power at all. I need to start caring less, for my own mental health. We have a good relationship. I just can't figure out how to stop taking it so personally.

I have hobbies, but it's hard to lose myself in them with how invested I am in the relationship. It's new to me to care so much. I've only ever felt this way with this particular person. Trying to figure out how to turn it off without sacrificing our friendship. I keep my feelings to myself almost all the time, but I'm sure I send out care-too-much vibes that are getting in my own way.

You should be aware that your comments are very US-centric. A lot of Indians in Europe/Canada/Australia are voting far-right due to the left-wing's aggressive support for the Muslim community. And it's not just first-generation, but the latter generations too.

It's propaganda such as yours that is helping to drive the swing to the far-right. The majority of racism/hate in places like Canada and the UK come not from the far-right white nationalists, but from Muslims/Pakistanis - who tend to be far more racist, colorist, homophobic, and misogynist, etc...

There are also serious cultural and socioeconomic differences between Muslims and Hindus - compare two ethnic groups with exclusive religious backgrounds: Sri Lankan Tamils and Pakistanis; a lot of people from both groups came from troubled backgrounds,  but the first had social mobility equal to NRI Sikhs and Hindus, while the second had social mobility akin to Black Americans. The same is true of the NRI community: disadvantaged people in both groups tend to have vividly different rates of social mobility.

I urge you to stop parading the notion that Muslim are the 'victims', when so much trouble is taking place stemming from the Muslim Community itself. You should realize how much power Hollywood (as a metonym including the journalism from the US) has over global culture and politics, especially in the English speaking countries such as Canada and UK.",18Feb2017,1
19,"Hey, I'm a second year university student, 20 years old and still living with my parents. I'm currently studying for my Bachelors of Science at my school. 

I've grown tired of what the program has to offer in terms of classes. I've wanted to learn about things such as anatomy and physiology for some time now which isn't taught in my program, I was unsure of what I wanted to do for an occupation when I started post secondary and I went for a bachelors of science degree because it was so middle of the road that I wouldn't be beholden to much and take general classes while I figured out what I really wanted. As much as I wanted to take a year or so off to work for finances (I pay for my own schooling) and get a better idea what I wanted as an occupation, I couldn't because my parents wouldn't let me, I would've been kicked out of the house.

I'm nearing the end of my second year now, still studying and taking the general courses in my program. I'm heavily considering moving into another program at my school, a physical education transfer that would let me get a kinesiology degree which would let me get a job as an athletic therapist or physiotherapist, which is what I want to do. I've booked an appointment with a career advisor at my school which will happen in a few days to ensure I know what I'm doing. 

The biggest problem is what my parents will think.

I've told them for years that I've wanted to be a doctor, which was true initially. I wasn't sure what type of doctor I'd be, but I thought going into Uni that for sure I would figure out exactly what type I'd be. But now that I know what I want to do, and that it's not that, I worry how they'll react. I don't want to lie to them about what I'm doing education wise and I'm terrible at Lying in general. I'm afraid they might kick me out, which is and isn't a big deal. They aren't very accepting people about a lot of things that I have yet to tell them, including this.

I have a friend I can move in with, we've talked about it in great detail, he lives with his family who I'm very close to and are open to letting me stay there provided I pay rent and/or buy my own groceries, which I do have the finances to keep up with on top of school. It is cheapest to live with my parents which is why I don't want to leave, on top of emotional reasons. I've yet to tell my parents about this and a number of things (mainly my sexuality, which I know they won't accept. I'm openly bi to everyone except them.) 

I know that I have to do this, I'm not backing down from my decision, but I dread having to tell them as they likely won't like this change, a lot. ",18Feb2017,2

The entire world and universe is just one knowing at that point, so then all letters are the same, and all words are the same.  So at that point,  there is a strong element or aspect of perception where the entire talk or teaching is meaningless, the only thing that has meaning is what's known, yet paradoxically, there can still be room for advancement and there often is, but focus on advancement without also having focus on the meaninglessness of advancement, hinders that advancement.  Its two separate layers of reality, one is dual and one is non-dual, and spoken about together regardless of attempts at logic always leaves you sounding crazy to most people.  So you can have the peace or bliss of advancing in meditation, but then you have the frustration which advances alongside this of putting fragments of non-dual experience into words.",18Feb2017,0

38,"what a day, i went to school and was made fun of for i don't know what even if i'm completely normal and above average looking, asked my friends if they wanted to go out, got no answer, asked my extra english class friends if they wanted to go out aswell, got no answer, went to the gym to throw my anger into something productive and found out the gym closed after 1h30 i went there.
what a godly day, how was yours?",18Feb2017,0
39,"I want you so bad. I want to text you, I want to show up at your house. I want you. You would only hurt me and yet I fucking want you. You are so fucked up. And now, feeling this way I realize how fucked up I must be too.  And codependency is drawing me to you. 

But fuck I want you. Like a drug. I know you're going to burn me if I give in and yet I want to give in. I tell myself you aren't even thinking about me. It's all in my head. You don't care about me at all. But you have no way of contacting me since I never gave you my phone number and I deleted my kik. I'm sure your life is back to normal while I'm fucking thinking about you. 

I tell myself I'm doing the right thing but it's the last thing I want to do. I want to go to you and wrap myself around you and hold you all night and not say a thing. But it's a dream and it would not be that way. 

Fuck I need to get better. I need to not think about you. I need it to not hurt. But I don't know how. I miss you. Never is a long time.",18Feb2017,10
40,"I still consider them extra powerful and they are 10 years old (they will run my puny scripts in a blink of an eye, indeed I use via C3 CPUs and they are powerful enough for some statistical analysis like ""how many groups of 10 digits one could extract from the largest prime every found to date?"") .

I'm old. I'm past the point of not return.",18Feb2017,4
41,"I really can't remember much from when I was a kid, it's not like I had any traumatic experiences but I honestly just don't remember much. One thing I do remember is probably one of strangest things that has ever happened to me. When I was like 4 or 5 (it was so bizarre that I've never forgotten this) I was in my room, and I was playing with my FAVORITE baby doll. I brought this doll with me everywhere it's even in a few family portraits. Anyway, I was playing w the doll when everything starts spinning. I don't know whether I was spinning or the room was but damn it was fast. And then it just stopped, after it stopped my baby doll was gone and I never saw it again. I've asked my parents as an adult if they threw it away or did that whole spinny thing but they had no clue what I was talking about. I remember this happening as clear as day and I know it wasn't a dream because one day I had my doll, and the next it was gone. I've wondered about what could've happened my whole life so...Any ideas? I'd love to here either legit or creative explanations!",18Feb2017,3
