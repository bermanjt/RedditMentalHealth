4,"I was checking out at the 99 cent store, and I saw a man in front of me with his son. A lot of times, stores put little toys and candy near the checkout so people can grab some snacks with ease. The son was pulling on the dad's tattered shirt asking if he could get a candy bar, and the dad only had like 3 items, which were headache medicine, some other medicine looking thing, and some ear drops. The dad looked at his three things, put back the ear drops, and replaced it with the candy bar. :( I really wanted to offer to pay for it, but I don't know why I didn't. Now I'm sitting here in front of my computer feeling so much regret for not offering to pay for his ear drops. T___T It might have something to do with not wanting his kid to see someone else paying for something his dad couldn't afford. But. Gah. :(

The area where I live has a pretty high Hispanic population, and I always see a huge group of day laborers standing in front of the gas station I pass by sometimes. I've seen them there as early as 6 am and as late at 4 pm waiting for someone to hire them. I keep telling myself that I'd like to hire one of them, pay them $10 an hour to do fake, light work, but really just take them to watch a movie, find a place to get a massage, and end the day with eating wherever they want to eat. However, I'm not really sure how I would pick someone out of the sea of people or if I can realistically afford to do something like that. And since I don't have any real work for them to do, they might be offended. I just feel so bad that I have a 9-5 job and all of these American privileges, and some people have to do a lot of really back-breaking work for low pay. And some days, they don't even know if they'll even be able to get work and may have to make the choice between buying their kid a chocolate bar or buying themselves ear drops. I'm so lucky to be born here. Why didn't I buy those ear drops? Ugh. T___T

9,"I'm kinda writing this as I go so it might not be the best written thing.

So I'm a dude and I just moved to the US overseas right before my junior year started and at first I felt alone. Like before I was at the same school for 11 years but I'm starting new now. So when school started I was eating lunch alone and didn't know anyone, but I eventually made friends. I usually eat lunch with this one girl who's also new and she's pretty cute so that's a damn big win for me. I would have never done anything like this a year ago so I guess I grew some balls. So I got to know some of the ""cool kids"" and smoked with them a few times and went to a party with them but they really don't talk to me much unless we run into each other in person. But still this is an improvement from last year where I hung out with mostly the nerdy kids. Hell, not even really hang out cause we never did shit outside of school. So at lunch I kinda switch between this girl and these 2 dudes that I can do boy stuff with like check out chicks and fuck around with. They're also both pretty known for doing drugs and stuff I think but they're chill so I don't really mind. Whenever I eat with these guys I kinda feel bad for the girl because I'm just leaving her there. But when I do eat with her it's kinda awkward cause there's long moments of silence.

So yeah things have improved since before I moved but I still feel unsatisfied. Like there's something missing in my life, and I don't know what it is. So right now I'm getting ready to get high and watch some movies on netflix and listen to music.

Oh right and I also have grades and universities to worry about but good thing the university near me is known as a party school so I'm probably gonna go there and get into parties I've been missing out on. But shit, I don't wanna pick my school just based on how hot the chicks are and whether there's a lot of parties or not

Also I'm thinking of dropping acid (Yes I'm gonna do it with a tripsitter and all that). Maybe my outlook on life will change. But I don't want to depend on drugs. Fuck I don't know I just feel like this isn't the life I want. I feel lost. Like what do I do now? Like I got friends in class and I think I'm a pretty chill dude but no one to do anything over the weekends. I told the girl I eat lunch with to hmu if she wants to do anything over the weekend today but I don't know if we'll be able to meet up or anything, cause I live a little far away and we both don't drive. But hey, I guess I got a lot more than some people do. Maybe I should just be grateful. Or maybe I should just keep pushing harder because I feel like everyone else parties and has the time of their lives except me. This was the mind of a 17 year old boy.

More and more, I find myself asking how far I'd get if I left right now. If I walked away now, if I left my apartment and my job and my studies and my family all behind me, how far away could I go? It used to be a kind of thought exercise, a mix between budgeting and escapism.

Tonight, I'm finding it very hard not to follow through.

See, it works like this: I have x amount of money in the bank, y amount of time before my anyone gets suspicious, and z amount of items I need to consider in order to get as far as I can, as fast as I can without making it too evident.

If I leave now, I'll have a couple thousand dollars I need to get from the bank. It's closed, so I'll have to use an ATM, but there are maximum withdrawal limits and aberrant-withdrawal-detection software to deal with, so I'll have to make my withdrawals over several days. I also have to consider where I'm withdrawing from--I don't want to lead a trail of bank-paper leading right to me. So, I'll feint.

Using debit to purchase train tickets eastward, I'll take several stops along the way to make my withdrawals. At the first of these, I'll notify the bank that I'm traveling and will need to make large withdrawals--this should help circumvent the issue of software which detects and flags unusual withdrawal patterns. I tend to think I'll only need about three days to get everything out, piecemeal at various locations, without having to sit a waiting period in any one spot for large transaction approval.

So, I should be able to get the bulk of my reserve money fairly easily and with a minimum of fuss. A couple thousand.

Those three days could eat into my budgeted time, but they don't have to. If I bring my phone and keep it charged, I can maintain contact with work and, more importantly, my friends and family.

Work is easy to handle: I work with kids. Kids are constantly sick this time of year, so I can easily say I caught something from one of them. That'll give me at least three days of freebie time off without having to find my own subs to cover my shifts. I can post the days I'll be absent and find subs during that time. I can do that while handling the money issue, and not worry about work coming looking for me after that. So long as the shift is covered, no questions will be asked.

My other work, my labwork/research, is even easier to get away with. I've been doing data analysis this quarter--computer stuff you can do from anywhere. As such, I make my own hours and come and go as I please (I'm an unpaid academic intern--what're they gonna do, dock my pay?). I do have a labgroup meeting normally scheduled for Tuesdays but, as luck would have it, it's cancelled this week.

I'm at a juncture where most of my friends are as busy as I am, so we don't see each other much. Hell, we can go weeks without talking, and it's not because anyone's mad at each other--we're all just super busy. I'm not overly worried about them coming looking. My family is another matter. One of my siblings calls about twice a month, another sibling maybe three times, another only when they need help with schoolwork, and the last never (except occasional Steam chat). My mother calls every nine days or so, unless I tell her I have an important deadline coming up--then I might go as long as two weeks between calls, or get interrupted every other day with her wanting updates.

She called a few hours ago, but I can also call her when I finish with the money issue to reset the clock.


So, to estimate conservatively, I have twelve days: three of bank stuff, then another nine before I miss a call from the first person to think to look for me.

We've already been fairly careful about not being traced. The paper trail from the banks leading back east will fall cold after day 3, from which point on I'd use cash only. After day 3, I also ditch my phone--don't want it tracing me by tower or GPS, don't need it anyway.

Now, for transit.

Rail makes the most sense. Flights require ID, and I don't have a car. Even if I did, I'd eventually have to ditch it and the title would circle back to me. So I take a train. I take a few, actually, starting with the one I just finished with. This time, I'm heading west.

Three slow days of eastward travel make it look like I was headed home, if anyone starts looking. I don't think I know anyone who lives out west. So, I'd go west.

South and west. Fast.

Planning to live on the cheapest things I can find, not bothering to break to seek housing or proper rest, I bet I could make the border if that was where I was aiming. If I plan it right, I could be there in less than six days.

Starting with twelve days, minus three on the bank shenanigans, minus six of further travel, gives three more days before anyone is likely to start looking.

Three's an appreciable number for what follows.

The end

I think I'd like to go quietly.

I'm not saying I'd necessarily have a choice. I would be a woman traveling alone, and that carries some measure of risk. I could take advantage of that, but the quiet fadeaway is my preference.

$100 will buy you either several days of a nice high or one good, long, quiet sleep if you know where to look. I'm no slouch with a needle--I'm a biologist, after all. And though I've never been a user myself, but I've known people who were. I know where to look.

Shouldn't take more than a day to rest up from travel and find a dealer. The day after that, I'm headed out of town.

Sometimes, I think Mississippi might be best. The desert is just too dry, a border crossing would be a hassle, and there's not much in the way of rail access in the US if we're being honest. A swamp is best, anyway, for disappearing.

Mississippi. Louisiana's too close to name-brand for swamps and emptiness. I'm not trying to be found. If I am found, I'm not trying to be identified. One of my siblings and I once talked about visiting Louisiana. We've never had call to talk about Mississippi. No one would even remotely guess to look there.

So, smack in hand, we'd have two days to go when I leave for nowhere.

I've always been pretty good at hiking. I can clear over ten miles of Appalachian hill and mountain before I need a break, and I've camped in swamps before. I could probably get at least five miles off the beaten path that day. Maybe I'd bring some kind of chum, or fertilizer, or something like that. Something to expedite the carbon cycle.

I think I'd finally be far enough, and with one day to spare.

By the last day, I *am* the carbon cycle.

I don't know.

I think it'd work.

I probably never will do anything like this, but depression like this is like a slab of stone that somehow grows as time goes on: unyielding, immovable, and hatefully featureless. It's a different size and shape for everyone: a pebble, a brick, a wall. Some people with depression stand beside their stone. Some people carry it. Some manage to chip away at it. I've tried all of these, and I can tell I'm about to hit the wall again.

I just don't know how to motivate myself to stick around.

I used to justify staying with a lot of different things, and it all boiled down to curiosity: I hadn't left yet because I was curious about what else there was that I hadn't yet seen, hadn't yet experienced.

I don't have that, anymore.

I'm simply not interested.

The days blur together, and I fight it like quicksand: the more I try, the worse it gets; the less I try, the clearer the eventual result becomes. And the stone doesn't leave just because we've switched metaphors--it's right there still, weighing me down.

I've dealt with this my whole life. My furthest memories are all bounded by that stone wall.

19,"Okay so I was with this guy for more than a year. We had it all, we were envied by many, it was awesome. For a while at least. We both were in uni and it was the cliché freshmen and senior couple. After half a year, he had to go for his masters.

He was a loyal boyfriend. We trusted each other and we never had problems of that sort. But we did have problems. Time was one of them. It was hard for him to find time for me. I understood, but sometimes you really can't help but feel lonely and tired. We tried to work it out for more than half a year. Then we had our anniversary, fancy dinnera and all that sort. But it wasn't easy. I felt lonelier everyday and one day I confessed that to him. The next day we talked things out, him saying that his second term will only get busier, and he doesn't want me to be lonely. But it was impossible for him to manage both me and education. He said that if we went on like before, he would achieve only barely satisfactory results on both grades and my satisfaction.

Through tears, we decided to let things go. He said one day we might get back together. But he said not to wait for it, for if it didn't come true, it will only let me down. It was painful and it still is. Everything seems to be a constant reminder of how good we had it. It's painful because he didn't do something shitty to make me hate him. We had to let go despite both of us still being in love and still caring for each other.

25,"My name is Andy. I am the son of a Syrian immigrant dad and an Iraqi immigrant mom. When I first read about the refugee ban, I was incensed. I come from a family of democrats. I am gay. There's no way I could ever support Trump. But then I read about a portion of the executive action, and I was actually a bit optimistic. You see, I am also an ethnic Christian. When Trump said that he would give Syrian Christians priority, I literally cried tears of joy. On the surface, it may seem self-serving of me, but there are many more layers to peel back, and this action can serve global and humanitarian interests. Please hear me out.

The Christians of Syria are not just a religious minority. We are also a separate racial minority. We are ethnic Syriacs and Assyrians. Along with the Yezidis, Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews, we also happen to be the top target for ISIS. Yes, estimates put Muslims as the primary victims in the war by a ratio of 2:1. But when you make up five percent of the population, that means we are the primary target of ISIS by a factor of ten. Our plight is more urgent strictly from a safety standpoint.

But our plight is also more urgent from an cultural standpoint as well. You see, we are also facing global extinction. We have a unique genetic lineage, speak a rare language, and have a distinct culture. We are far more than Christians. Our language is expected to disappear by the end of the century if action isn't taken. We are the modern equivalent of Native Americans, and this is our Trail of Tears. I don't want to turn my story into guilt porn, but some of the atrocities  lodged against Assyrians/Syriacs/Yezidis are exceptionally horrific in the midst of all that is happening. A Yezidi woman testified in Washington that she was gang raped, and her 9-year-old neighbor was as well, but the physical trauma killed her. A family saw in horror as their two children were found crucified in the school playground. My dad's family told of a story where a woman was force fed the remains of her dead child. I tremble as I type this. And it's not just our people, but our history that's being wiped off the face of the earth. Our ancient artifacts are being destroyed by ISIS, and it's extremely disheartening. 

This isn't our first genocide. We, along with Armenians were nearly wiped out in by Islamists 100 years ago in the largest cultural genocide next to the Holocaust. I'm hoping the same mistakes won't be repeated. While we make up five percent of the Syrian population, and more than five percent of the Syrian refugees, we accounted for less than one-half of one percent of the refugees admitted into the U.S. Several prominent human rights groups have decried the discrepancy, amounting it to ethno-religious discrimination by the Obama administration. So when I heard that Trump is giving preferential treatment to the Christians, you can see why I was happy. On the surface, simplifying the decision based on religion is a huge mistake for Trump. For the reasons I outlined, it's more than just a religious choice. It's helping the people whose need is the most urgent, and it's saving a RACE (not a religion) of people from being extinguished.

I don't agree with the idea of a Muslim ban. And I believe that Trump's wording of ""Christians"" is a misnomer. And I believe he should extend the priority acceptance towards other critically endangered ethnicities like the Yezidis, Sephardis and Mizrahis. It's also important to note that what Trump is espousing, and what is actually happening are completely different. But for a race of innocent people, we can breathe a little easier today.

edit: While I was optimistic about what Trump said, it's proven to not be in line with what is happening on the ground. If Trump TRULY means what he says, and isn't paying lip service to the thealt-right, then he will give ethnic minority refugees P-2 status, something that the U.S. has done for decades.",29Jan2017,18

34,"Whether one is married, cohabiting, or dating someone steadily, problems invariably arise. Sometimes they are minor and can be easily resolved, but others make it difficult or impossible to sustain the bond. I've provided online counseling for the last seven years to well over a thousand individuals (most often about their relationships) and couples throughout the world. I have one general observation which might help couples avoid unnecessary conflict and a recommendation in case one or both seek professional help.

A common feature of much discord among couples is what cognitive therapists call 'mind-reading'--- the assumption that a partner's state of mind can be inferred from their actions, including their words. This method is notoriously unreliable, because behavior and communication can often be interpreted in a variety of plausible ways. Needless bickering can be generated or exacerbated by mind-reading, especially these days when texts have replaced the phone and face-to-face exchanges, but major crises can as well. 

Quite a few of my clients have, for example, been distraught to discover that their partner, who they felt they had a good relationship with in all respects, has been downloading pornography. Without bothering to consider all the possible reasons this could be happening, the client assumes their partner is unhappy in the relationship and/or unhappy with their sex life. Yet, these are the least likely explanations. Curiosity is probably the primary motivation: porn sites account for about a third of  downloads worldwide. Their partner's boredom with their self-generated sexual fantasies (a nearly universal human mental activity) is a close second. Even if the pornographic themes discovered are unusual or disturbing one can't assume their partner is seriously interested in experiencing them any more than they plan to enact non-sexual fantasies in real life (e.g., violence towards bosses, landlords, political leaders).

Even when one discovers their partner is flirting, or even sexting, with someone at long distance on social media, it might be, as apparently in the infamous Anthony Weiner saga, caused more by a desire for ego gratification than by unhappiness in their relationship or a presumed prelude to an affair. Women often get attention from male strangers who stare at them or try to initiate conversations in public places, and whereas this is generally perceived as extremely annoying, if not harassment, it also delivers a message that can be somewhat ego-enhancing. Established partners are expected to find each other appealing, so such declarations may not be as immediately rewarding as ones made by (at least some) strangers. Men who are not celebrities rarely get that sort of approbation in public, thus are more inclined to utilize active methods to achieve the same end. Flirting per se does not indicate a desire to go beyond that.

When one's interpretation of a partner's behavior is very disturbing, the emotional reaction it produces is often perceived as sufficient evidence to determine its validity. People believe they would not feel so upset if there was no basis for it. On the contrary, they are engaging in&lt;em&gt; emotional reasoning, identical to that of a hypochondriac who believes their intense worry about having a serious medical problem proves they have one. 

So, if mind-reading augmented by emotional reasoning is not reliable, what is a better approach when one discovers something unexpected and disturbing about one's partner? The best initial option is to consider a variety of explanations and the relative strength of the evidence for each. Another possibility is simply ignoring the revelation, if no significant problems appear to exist in the relationship. Alternately, one can ask their partner what their behavior signifies, but with finesse to avoid putting them on the defensive.  Regarding pornography, one might casually mention having read the statistics on how prevalent consumption is. If the mention of this phenomenon is not perceived as obviously directed at the partner's use, a revealing answer might be forthcoming.

If one discovers a partner is texting or sexting a stranger whose zip code is not remote, there is undoubtedly a greater potential for an actual liaison than with an image or webcam interaction. Thus, it is harder to ignore even if one's relationship seems to be solid. The behavior might well be simply for ego-gratification or expressing a side of their personality missing in normal life---a shy person role-playing their opposite--- or, it could be more, even if a relationship is solid. Confrontation is less likely to bring about clarity or resolution. Even if contact ceases under duress, fantasies can remain and relapse is a distinct possibility. If mind-reading skills are rare, the ability to convincingly lie about clandestine behavior is not. Thus, in cases involving liaisons with others, and with other discoveries or issues where observation or mind-reading is accurate, e.g., substance abuse, anger management, growing apart, sexual problems, professional counseling might help. 

Unfortunately, most people with relationship problems who seek help receive individual counseling or get their partner to accompany them--- as a couple--- during which they always meet jointly with the counselor. In the former situation, the most common, the counselor will only know about the partner as depicted by their client. Such information is invariably limited, because clients lack relevant facts and may also fail to provide information about themselves central to comprehending their partner's behavior. In traditional marriage counseling, one or both parties might be reluctant, for many reasons, to be entirely forthcoming in front of the other.

Counselors rarely suggest speaking to each partner separately---even one time and with both parties' confidentiality assured---whether providing individual or couples' counseling. Worries about being perceived as disloyal to their client(s) supersede concerns they may be handicapped by missing critical information. This conventional practice encourages counselors to engage in risky and counter-productive mind-reading as well, albeit with less likelihood of emotional reasoning coloring their views. It is therefore up to the client, if they want the most effective help with seemingly intractable relationship problems, to insist a counselor agree to break with tradition---or find one who will.",29Jan2017,8

42,"We were married for 5 years, divorced for 2. By the second year of marriage, it became clear she wasn't being faithful. There's no reason to go into a lot of detail on it, but the short version is that I ended up liking it and giving it my blessing. Yes, I'm aware there's a word for it, and it's not a word I particularly like using because I don't like feeling like ""one of those guys."" I never watched it or took videos or anything like that. I didn't ask for graphic descriptions or details. It was enough just hearing her confirm it and knowing what had happened.

Which brings me to my present dilemma. This fetish hasn't gone away, and I've been dating again. You would think, from a man's perspective, that if you were to tell a man he could sleep with whoever he wanted and you'd allow it, that he'd consider it a jackpot. Women are, it seems, somewhat less accepting.

And I know it's easy to say ""hey, maybe you're not over your ex yet."" I considered that possibility, but I really don't think it's the case. I honestly don't care one way or the other if I ever see her again. Most of her qualities, I'm not looking for in a new partner. I don't think about her sexually, I don't miss waking up to her. As much as this would be the easiest answer, I really don't think it's the case.

So I'm at a loss. I can try to put it to bed and accept a normal relationship. That doesn't seem like it would be that satisfying to me. I *definitely* don't want to be one of those guys who gets into a relationship with someone normal and then pressures them into doing it where they just end up feeling like shit over it. So far I've just been bringing it up fairly early in conversation when that sort of stuff is appropriate to mention. Not dwelling on it or making a huge thing of it. If she wants to ask more, she can. Looking bewildered and trying to figure out if I really meant what I said is also a popular option.

So I'm really just not sure. Give it up? Keep plugging and hoping for the best? Get therapy? A and C? I'm open to suggestions.

43,"I would normally post this in r/offmychest but I'm unable to post there for some reason. 

Every day is a struggle. 

And when I say that I'm not over generalising. I really mean it. I struggle. There's things other people find incredibly simple that are just daunting to me. Yet no one tries to understand. MY own family call me unreasonable and a big baby. I regularly want to curl up and cry most of the time. I just struggle with everything. The only time I feel happy and at home is acting; on stage or on screen (when I can). Yet everyone tells me to give up on it. Carerr advisors, family everyone tells me ""There's no career in it. Find something else"". But no one understands why I don't want to give up the only thing I feel alive doing. 

I've had a job in a shop for the past few weeks. It's stressful. I'm expected to work as fast as someone who's been there years, but that's impossible. I also can't work alone on the tills. I need someone with me on the till next to me. Alone I struggle. There's too many buttons, too many customers, too many requests I don't know how to respond to, too many people who don't respond when I ask them questions I need the answer to, too many mistakes made when my finger slips or someone changes their mind when it's too late. I am close to breaking point. I'm very close to just breaking down crying. I didn't even want the job in the first place. I try and tell people my problems but no one listens. People make out they're either not a big deal or, if it's my family, they just assume I don't want to work and making excuses. When the truth is, I do want to work but I just need a little more support and training. Yet this is somehow an unreasonable demand. 

I regurarly argue with my family. It's gotten worse since my grandparents moved in. They're very set in their ways and just don't get why some things are a struggle for me. My Mum never sticks up for me and always sides against me so I'm always outnumbered. Somehow I'm always ""asking for it"" or ""bringing it on myself"". My grandfather can turn violent when he does get really angry. 

My confidence is rock bottom. Everytime I feel slightly confident, something brings me crashing down. My confidence also means I struggle bringing up problems I'm having at work because I'm just scared of causing a fuss. Acting is the only time I feel confident. I want to start a career in acting, yet no one seems to want to help me find where to start. 

I haven't had much luck in romance. My longest relationship lasted four months before he dumped me rather suddenly by text - yet he keeps asking me to meet up with him for sex. I struggle to have feelings for people because I ultimately feel like I'm just scared of being hurt again. 

I feel like no one genuinely cares about *me*. When I start talking to people about me and my problems I get the sense they just tune out. Yet I'm always expected to listen to other's problems. 

I'm at the stage now where I just feel empty inside. Only acting and movies/TV shows/books and video games are giving me any emotional fulfillment. I just feel lost and I don't know where to go from here. I feel people just expect me to be someone I'm not.

61,"This is the brief story of my life of mental, physical, and sexual abuse, by my own mother. Mixed in, is a world of confusion, lies, and manipulation by the rest of my broken family. These are only the things I feel ""comfortable"" talking about. What's left out, is stuff I can even utter a single word to myself about, let alone give more than a couple seconds thought to.

Let's begin before my birth, in the womb. The umbilical cord was wrapped around my neck, and stayed that way up until my delivery, out from the womb. I almost died at birth. The events that followed lead me to believe that I tried killing myself before I was born, because of things that happened while I was still inside my mother. There was chaos. There was pain. There was suffering. Science has already proven that the external environment can affect the baby in a mothers womb. And the external environment was a literal hell, and never ceased to be hell.

Let's deviate for a brief moment. My mom is a manipulator. She is sadistic. It is amazing, to witness somebody (her), be one, evil way, yet instantly change to a seemingly innocent person when others we're around. She would tarnish my reputation, even as a child, to make herself look good, and to make it appear as though I we're a bad seed. I never understood what I did wrong. Never knew why she would do this to me. But as I grew older, I started to realize some things. Most of my childhood is blocked out, but my memories are slowly returning. Maybe more will come back as I type this story of mine, in hopes that I can receive closure, and move on.

I didn't know my father, was my father, until about the age of 6. Everyone lied and said he wasn't, and that he was just some guy. I called him by his first name until I was about 8. Apparently, he abused me, hit me, and shook me as a baby. But, after seeing what he was really like, I knew this was false. I do not believe he did anything of those things. In fact, he is one of the most caring, kind, and thoughtful people I know. Selfess beyond compare. Yet, my mother tried to turn me against him.

My siblings, and my mother, all told different stories, and events, and none matched up. I had to learn at an early age to think for myself, and to be open minded, to discover the truth. My siblings even let me try smoking cigarettes, at the age of 3. And to consume alcohol. I hated both of those things. There we're so many lies between all sides (mother and siblings) that I had no idea what the truth was, no idea who I was, no idea what anything was or what anything meant.

My mom always abused me, except for when it benefitted her not to. Name calling, put downs, lies, making me feel worthless, beating me, breaking objects over me, and.....molesting me. I guess I developed stockholm syndrome, because eventually I actually justified the things she did to me. It was ""normal"" to me. She tried her hardest to make me hate my father.....and it worked. But later in life, I put the pieces together, and now I love him, and respect him, and look up to him.

My mother would twist stories around, and make me feel as if I we're the crazy one. The first time I wanted to kill myself was at the age of 8. She said I wasn't serious, and even made a joke of it, and I didn't get the help I needed, and thought I never deserved it. She forced me to always do things that I never wanted to do, things that I hated, things that I got made fun of for, things that made me feel like a real piece of shit.

And she got away with all of it. EVERY. SINGLE. FUCKING. THING. And she still does. To this day, get's away with torturing me and putting me through hell.

Making messes on purpose and forcing me to clean them, breaking things and making me fix them, even though I couldn't. Condemning me for poor school work, with no patience beyond a few seconds for me to get something right. Sent to bed without food, just because. Left outside in rain and cold. Threatening to have me ""taken away"" if I ever spoke of any of this. So I never talked to anyone about any of it. I thought this was going to be the way things had to be. The physical abuse wasn't all that bad, I guess, compared to the constant mental abuse. In fact, I'd prefer it if it we're all just physical. Maybe.

So I finally decide to talk to someone about this. An elementary school therapist/guidance counselor. I couldn't defend my position well enough, because I was afraid to say too much, that my mom would hurt me, or kill me. And she's tried killing me before, but we'll get to that later. She made herself look innocent, again, for the therapist, and that I was just a ""problem child"".

I even went to guidance counselors in middle school. Same thing as the previous block of text in this story. So I never really got help. Until high school, when I had my first mental breakdown. I forgot to mention, that at age 10, I held a knife to my chest, and almost pierced through, but I like to think God stopped me then. That was my first suicide ""attempt"".

High school was hell for me too. I was stricken with insomnia all 4 years, and 3 years after, from all the shit that has happened to me. I went to the hospital about 3 times during high school, for suicidal ideation. Even went to outpatient programs. All to try and help myself, to not let her (my mom) win, to not let her evil ways destroy me further.

But I went to the hosp another 3 times after high school, and the last time, was recent. January of 2017. Sorry, let me go backwards a bit, I'm skipping ahead a lot.

Because of her abuse, I took a liking to psychology. Her personality fits these almost perfectly: Borderline Personality Disorder, Sociopathy, and Bipolar. I studied psychology since the age of 14, as well as many other things.

The type of person I am......is the complete opposite of her. Do I have rage-filled outbursts? of course, but caused by her. Have I broken things? Of course, because of her. I am always putting others first. Always kind to others. I may have slipped up a few times, but who hasn't? I have no idea what I did, to deserve the treatment I got, and still get from that evil bitch. I must have fucked up in a past life or something. Or, maybe I fucked up in life, and died, and this is hell, and my punishment. Aside from her bullshit, the other events unrelated to her that happen in my life, make me question reality.

So many ""coincidental"" things have happened, that defy all reason and logic, I can't help but feel there is something out there trying to see my suffer and fail. These ""coincindences"" happen so often, I'd be crazy if I didn't think there was something out there trying to ruin my life. But, I still try to believe that it's all just coicindence. That I just have the shittiest of luck. But enough about that.

That evil bitch called my mother, denies everything. Even to my own face. How can you fucking do that? YOU KNOW DAMN WELL THE FUCKED UP SHIT YOU'VE DONE TO ME AND STILL DO. HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY SIT THERE, STAND THERE, AND LIE, RIGHT IN MY FACE, EVEN WHEN THERES NO ONE ELSE AROUND TO PRETEND FOR? WHAT THE FUCK.

She knows what buttons to push, and intentionally pushes them. She tries taking everything away from me. It's gotten to the point where I have homicidal thoughts about her, and almost killed her. But let's take a slight step back and call attention to how she's tried to kill me multiple times. The last time, and only one I wish to mention, was when we we're arguing. This was when I was in middle school. She at one point said something along the lines of ""oh you hate me? I'll kill you then!"" Of course, that statement isn't exactly accurate, but it's what I remember. And she grabbed a hammer, and chased me up the stairs with it to my room. I had closed my door and locked it, and she was breaking the door with the hammer, and eventually broke the door knob loose. I had tried pushing a dresser in front of the door before she got up the stairs, and by that time she was already breaking through, so I rushed to push my bed upagainst it was well. She was only able to open the door enough for part of her torso to fit through, and an arm with the hammer. I screamed for her to stop, and that I loved her. She was gone. And by gone, I mean her mind was gone, her only goal was to kill me, and you could see it in her eyes, as if she was fucking possesed. For a brief moment I stopped pushing my bed up against the door, and she got inside, but a hard knocking was on the front door of the house. The police were there. The neighbors heard the commotion and called the cops, and I'm glad they did. But, for whatever reason, in my fucked up state of mind, I helped my mom appear innocent. I've always had to lock my door and barricade it at night since then. Especially all the times she said ""I'll killyou in your sleep"" and ""you better sleep with one eye open"".

I fucking hate her. And I am disappointing God by doing so, and I hope one day I can forgive her, and that one day God can forgive me for hating her.

Now, she wants to take my dog from me. My beautiful, beloved, best friend, who means the world to me. He's like a child to me. He was gifted to me, and before I could do anything she licensed him under her name. I am now struggling to get him back, especially since she is also abusive to him as well.

My poor fucking buddy. Sweetest dog to ever cross my path. Always tear trails down his cheeks from his eyes when he's around her. It tears me apart, and fuels my homicidal thoughts towards her even more.

But I know that's what she wants. She wants me to snap, to lose control, and to fail. But I'm better than that, I'm stronger than that, I will not let her win. I will not give her what she wants. Karma will visit her soon enough, and she will rot in hell. I just pray that it's not her. I pray that she see's the light, and changes, so she can get into heaven. Because, I believe she is influenced by some kind of evil. Nothing else explains the way she is. Or, maybe I'm just fucked in the head and sympathizing with her. I don't know.

And then the people who don't believe me......I despise those fucking pieces of shit so much. I've held all of this in for years, and when I finally want to get help, and to talk about it, I get shit thrown in my face for it. So now I don't tell anyone anything, other than my therapist. Only the people who are medical professionals who actually have a functioning brain and try to help me. And I am thankful for them.

Maybe one day I will write a book detailing everything. What I've typed here today, doesn't even scratch the surface of the shit this woman has done, the harm she has caused me, and the damage to me physical and mental health. I just needed to get this off my chest, pubclically. In hopes that someone, other than the medical professionals, will believe me.

I just need someone to listen to me, to believe me, to connect with. Nobody understands me. I have nobody other than my father and my dog. Well, when I get my dog back, anyway. I'm sick of living like this. Going through this. I don't deserve this, I never did.

She even has the audacity to say ""oh what does the dog even do for you"" BITCH HOW FUCKING IGNORANT CAN YOU BE. THE THERAPEUTIC VALUE AND THE BOND BETWEEN ME AND HIM. THAT DOG HAS DONE MORE FOR ME THAN YOU EVER FUCKING HAVE CUNT. FUCK YOU.

But maybe people don't believe me because I can't find the words to tell them these things. I choke up, and don't make sense. But, typing it all out, allows me to get my thoughts across better.

I guess all I ask, is that whoever reads this, please pray for me. Please pray for my family, for my mom, for my dad, for my dog. Idk how much longer I can do this for.",29Jan2017,1
