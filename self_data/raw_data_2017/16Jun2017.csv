3,"First of all, I'm not looking to get redpilled out of cucktown. I'm good.

About 3 years ago I was doing fine, I wasn't some kind of smooth talking love machine, but I could flirt relatively easily and knew when to act. 

Since then I'm not sure what's changed, but I kind of freeze up when it comes to making a move, the flirting thing isn't a problem really, I feel like I can hold a conversation ok. 
I think it stems from two communication problems: 1) I can never tell if someone is into me anymore, and 2) I'm too worried about coming off like a creep to make a move and let on that I am into someone.

Occasionally (very occasionally) after a night out a friend will mention that I should have made a move on a girl and I'll either not know that they were interested and I had a chance, or I will know but was too scared/worried/nervous to make a move.

Any advice on how to improve on this. I'm in my early 20s and I feel like I'm missing out on a lot, so I want to improve on that, I just don't know where to start.",16Jun2017,2

10,"Hey guys, 

So on the desperate quest of finding a house to live in, my 2 friends signed a lease for a 4 bedroom house. There are four of us and only two on the lease.

Leading up to this I was hesitant about many things, many personal reasons but also on the idea that the price seemed 'too good to be true'. The first Google result when I typed in the address led me to the bed bug registry-- needless to say, I was extremely alarmed. The two reviews from 2015 were really aggressive, so when I showed them to my friends, they took it with a grain of salt and determined it must have been someone who simply had a bad experience with our landlord. 

My friend asked the realtor who showed us the home if the house ever had bed bugs and she brushed it off, saying 'no', but that it gets treated for preventative measures every year. 

Fast forward, I was the last one to move  into the house, 2 weeks into the lease. On my 3rd night, I am struck with the news that we indeed have bed bugs. My two roommates who moved in first had bites on their bodies and spotted several on their sheets. Because I was so new, I don't think they had made it to my room..  yet.

I left immediately, and now I'm living back at my parents home. I grabbed all my clothing and ran it through the dryer.. still currently living out of bags because I'm not sure what my next step is. There have been two fumigations with a bed bug spotting in between (read below)

*Also, the home is a duplex and only our side is being treated currently.

So my question is now two fold--

1.) This was certainly indicative of an existing problem because bed bugs take a bit longer than two weeks to hatch I believe. Because the home was vacant prior to us moving in, they must have been hiding in the walls waiting for a food source to come out (humans). No legal implications since the landlord took action promptly, but still seems extremely dodgy since we were lied to about the home never having bugs. Question here-- it's since been two weeks and there have been two fumigations. The follow up was rushed because a surviving bed bug was spotted in clear daylight. When do you know the problem has subsided? My roommates have finally begun to unpack their stuff, but I fear that it may be premature. I am not sure if that surviving bug was indicative of an infestation much more grave than we imagine. 

2. I am not on the lease, so I can legally walk away and find someone to take my place. I would have to wait 2 months since I've paid the next + last AND I'm sure no one would move into a home with such a recent bug problem. Is this problem sufficient reason to leave a place? I am nervous that these bed bugs are going to come back, and maybe I would rather cut my losses. I also fear that if I leave, and the bed bugs don't come back, then I'll live with a massive regret. 

Has anyone experienced bed bugs? How long was the timeline for you. If you had the option, would you have moved out?",16Jun2017,1

19,"Hi, Reddit. I'm 19 and this is the shortened form of my story.

I knew a girl from HS that I had a huge crush on. Problem: she's a twin with my best friend. Didn't confess to her because I didn't want to ruin our friendship. Went to different collegea, I fell into depression, social anxiety increased, didn't make many friends (this was a combination of her, coding, debt, finances, etc). Finished freshman year. Summer comes, finally builds up the confidence to ask friend for his sister's number. He gives it, I texted her and I can already tell she's not interested in me in that way: never initiates first in convos, never texts back at times, diction from her texts makes it seem like she's trying to rush and finish the convo. Fell into ANOTHER depression, and one of my college friends told me that I'm such an amazing person and hints from the past make it seem likes she (college friend, not HS crush) likes me. 

Now I'm conflicted because being alone intimately my whole life, I can't imagine being loved by another woman. I don't want to get my hopes up. Sure, I always get the same reasoning, ""BuT, cOmE oN bRo, YoU'rE sO yOuNg. YoU'lL fInD sOmEoNe..."" Fuck that. I know I won't have the courage or the appeal to get a girl to like me.",16Jun2017,2

27,"Do you think the ""friend"" who reported her missing knew the truth and was low-key trying to get her busted? Either way that sounds like the worst friend ever, damn. Clingy af. Gotta call her before you hit up the damn supermarket lest you be declared legally dead. 

For those who are out of the loop: 

A streamer known for being kind of an asshole went to an E3 mixer, got drunk, and disappeared with a group of guys. It was later discovered that she went to a hotel room to ""party"" with them all night long. 

Her friend declared her missing on Facebook which started a manhunt for this girl who was doing hoe shit all night. She then posted a video with an extremely sore throat (lol) from a hotel room, which she removed minutes later. She then posted another video with two strange women and a dozen tweets saying she was alive. 

The boyfriend said it's over with her but she still has yet to talk to him. 

Edit: apparently the girl is doing damage control, deleting old tweets and changing her story up again. She has a legion of white Knights now defending her, including some idiot who is going to stream a 20 hour poker game to somehow prove something? 

Honestly her delusional fans, including the two in this thread, are the funniest part here. She's not even a very good streamer, she's extremely generic and sounds very entitled. ",16Jun2017,216
28,"Since the mods at /r/lifeprotips think they know everything, and dictate what a LPT is, they removed my post without letting the people decide. So I'm posting here. Sorry LPT mods, that not how it works. Not how it should work anyway. You don't get to decide for other people what will benefit them or not, what the hell do you know? Nothing.

Anyway..

tl;dr: People who want to get to the top, or stay at the top, don't like you if you're also trying to get there. Also, people who are at the bottom with you, may get jealous and try to ruin you.

I'm one of the best workers I know (I rarely compliment myself, I hate myself, just lemme brag a lil for once, please) and yet I've lost many jobs.

You may be wondering, ""well, if he's such a good worker, why has he lost so many jobs?""

I'll tell you. It's exactly because of that, coupled with shitty bosses.

When it comes to work, I'm all work, no play. I get my solid work ethic from my father. Sorry, HE is the best worker I know. 65 years old and still get's more shit done than people in their 20s and teens, and healthy as hell.

When I work, I get shit done. ""If you're going to do something, do it right, or don't do it at all"" is what my father would always tell me. So, I made sure anything I did, I did right, and that's what I do.

I've received special recognition from employers, as well as awards (like little 5 dollar break cards and other stuff).

I started working at 12 years old (special circumstances). Lost the job only because business slowed down. I wasn't part of their family so I didn't get to stay. It was a family run business. Couple others got laid off too. I was okay with that, I had school and other stuff providing more things on my plate to handle. Worked there for 6 years.

I've lost a few jobs since that one, but never knew why. I always did everything right, well, and went above and beyond.

But one day, it started to all make sense. I landed a job at a restaurant, with a lady friend, and worked one day. I lost the job, even though my work was exceptional.

The reason why? Because ""I was too intimidating"" ............

Let that sink in for a moment.

No, really, I need to install that new sink upstairs so let it in.

Anyway, yeah. So, upon further investigation, I found out that the boss wanted somebody who he could boss around easily, and someone who wouldn't outshine him. Which was weird, because he bossed me around, and I let him. I didn't care, I needed money. Maybe it was because I didn't have the demeanor of being his little toy to push around? Idk.

So I started thinking, and thought back to other jobs I've had. Then it all started coming together. Woops, back track, another example. I'll stop after this one: working at a warehouse, worked so well and so fast, that I had free time to go and help other employees with their work. So I did. Guess what happened? I lost the job. Why? Because ""I was too slow for the process"" and that was the best explanation I got.

Too slow? Too slow? I got my work done, perfectly, and fast enough, to go help others, and you tell me I'm too slow? My bullshit detector went crazy. So, I took my loss and gave the dual-middle finger to the entire building and peeled out ripping a sweet donut and drift.......ok fine, I really just left like any normal person would.

So, I investigated further. And the reason I'm about to tell you may offend some people, but if it does, idk what to tell you, because it's the gottdamn mf'ing truth and I'm not trying to cause controversy here:

I lost the job, to get replaced by hispanics who got paid a little less. Yes. So much for that white privilege huh? But it's cool, idc, no sense in festering and dwelling over that. PS racism is not cool.

So, I decided eventually, to talk to others about this, and I learned a few thing's from my elders:

-When you're candle is burning bright, there will always be someone trying to blow it out. In other words, the better you are doing, the more careful you should be.

-If a boss tells you to do something one way, but you have a better way, don't just do it your way. This will piss your boss off and might make them feel ""threatened"" by your ""superiority"". Rather, suggest to them, your method, and see what they say.

-If you're working well, some salty people may take notice, and try to sabotage your reputation and make you lose the job, so they don't lose theirs.

-Don't be afraid to give all you've got, but test the waters and see what you can accomplish without risking losing your job due to a salty boss or employee.

I wish I was lying about all of this. But this is reality, and the world we live in. Everything is competition with everyone. I just wish I had learned this sooner. Maybe not, idk.",16Jun2017,3

Does not bother with his own interests

And does not despise others who do

And does not make a virtue of poverty

He goes his way without relying on others

And does not pride himself  on walking alone

While he does not follow the crowd

He won't complain of those who do

Rank and reward make no appeal to him

Disgrace and shame do not deter him

He is not always looking for right and wrong

Always deciding ""Yes"" and ""No""

30,"So my friend of a girl I went out on date with told me the reason there was no second date was because the girl thought I was a really bad kisser. Is it true? Probably, she's the second person I've ever kissed so I've had minimal experience. But for some reason I've been feeling really crappy about it. I think it's because at the time she told me she really enjoyed it and she wanted to do it again and scheduled a second date with me before canceling it because ""although she really had a great time she didn't want to start a relationship cause we were going to college in different states."" Fluffing things up? Probably again, but now I just feel like an idiot. Idk I really enjoyed the time we had and thought she was a really great person so it kinda sucks to realize that I lost a date because my kissing skills are subpar. She wasn't the better of the two kisses I've had either, so it really hadn't occurred to me that she might think I was super bad.

Not everyone in the UK loves the queen. Obviously I'm not speaking from a majority stand point but I'd like to make my point of view known to the rest of the world that, at large, I've seen thinks the opposite. Now I'm not well read on UK economics in this area and I'm not ready to make the argument of cost vs worth against the queen but rather take it from a more gut-feeling point of view (for lack of a better term.)

This comes most recently from the picture of the queen meeting with some of the firefighters involved in the recent disaster in London and most of the comments read among the theme of ""you're so lucky to have a queen!"" while any anti-queen (or monarchy in general) comments were buried in down votes so fast they don't get a real chance to give any reason. For me it's to do with the over all image of the UK, and knowing that there's millions in need of food banks and the NHS is stretched to it's limit, I just can't get behind the idea of the country having a figurehead living in a literal palace with insane amounts of wealth, only being there in the first place because she was born to the right parents. One example that pisses me off is the somewhat recent renovations to buckingham palace, costing about £360 million. Seeing that kind of money being thrown around to upkeep this position while passing an increasing amount of people begging on the streets just doesn't feel right.

It's also a question of the undemocratic nature of a monarchy. Now I know the queen doesn't have a massive amount of power but to me *any* amount of power handed to a person in this way is an offense to democracy. The UK just went through an intense election and at the end of it all, the elected leader has to go to the queen to check if it's ok to form a government.

Most of this is just a ramble, there's alot I'm missing out and I'm not going to bother checking over what I've written mainly because I'm almost certain this is going to be downvoted but I just wanted to get my voice out there however small - some people resent the idea of a monarchy.",16Jun2017,2

Bit of backstory: My best friend Mike has been dating Lily for around 3 months. Mike and I are from the same town, but Lily moved to same place as us to start college. The 3 of us get on really well together and they don't mind me ""third-wheeling"". Mike is clinically depressed and takes anti-depressants.

The other night, the 3 of us went to the pub and and we all went back to Mike's house to keep drinking after the pub closed. After more drinking, Lily told us that back in her hometown a guy at a party had sex with her on the side of a road while she was drunk despite her repeated pleas for him to stop. Mike and I were both shocked and angry. Mike told Lily that she should've reported him but she said she that it took her ages to get over and she doesn't want to bring it all back up again. She soon after went to bed and fell asleep.

As soon as she was asleep, Mike literally flipped shit and begged me to get on a train with him back to where she used to live to go and kill this guy (she told us his name). In my drunken state, I agreed that I would go with him because Lily is such a nice girl and it makes me really mad that someone did that to her. Mike is now on vacation for a few days but when he gets back, he wants to get revenge. Many of you may be unsure of whether he would actually kill someone, but his depression has led to some very erratic behavior in the past so I am unsure. Obviously I am not going to be any part of him killing this guy, but I don't want to just let him go there on his own and get in any trouble. What should I do to talk him down? I also personally believe the guy should be held accountable for what he did, should I persuade Lily to report him or would I undo the years of therapy she went through?

44,"My mum has breast cancer and next week she's going into surgery. I went with her to her doctor (male) where we asked questions about the surgery and what comes after that. The doctor kept asking if I had questions, looking into my eyes and holding the stare. ""You can send me questions through email if you want, if you're drawing a blank right now and I'll gladly answer them later."" He said that he will take part of the tumor and ganglion of my mother to do further tests, also to see if my brothers and I (male) are in risk of potentially getting breast, nipple or prostrate cancer in the future. He said that he could examine me immediately to see if I was in risk. I'm reaching my thirties, do exercise every day and eat healthy. But I thought that he was being a generous and very professional Doctor, so I accepted his offer, because why not, better safe than sorry. My mum left the room and he locked the door.  

I took my t-shirt off and he was two steps apart noticing my chest and said that it was symmetrical, that I had a nice body and at a first glance everything looked ok. Then he started examining my chest, he asked if this hurts or not, and started complimenting my tan. ""Your nipples look OK"" he said, ""though the left one is a little bit bigger, have you noticed?"" I answered that maybe I'm doing more effort with one arm than the other while exercising. The doctor asked if I ever had a hernia in my groin. I answered yes. ""Loose your jeans, please"" he requested. I did, he then pull my boxers down, examined my penis and testicles, he was gladly surprised: ""Oh, you also are well-shaved down there."" 
""Please lay in bed and turn over"" he requested while my pants were still down. He examines my back and goes again ""Oh, you look more than tanned in your back."" I replied that I still do apply sunblock every morning. ""You look like you need help to apply it here down your back. I could help you with that."" When he said that I immediately connected the dots: he was coming up to me. 

I was naked and very nervous and completely self-conscious. The doctor asked me to stand up. He ""examined"" my chest again and mentioned once more the detail with my left chest being a little bit bigger than the right, but that it wasn't a big deal. He turned me around and I felt very shy, I pulled my pants up. He sat on his chair with his legs wide open and a laid back posture. I had a nervous laugh, grabbed my glasses shook his hand, he hold it tight and asked when I was coming back to see him. I mumbled that next week, when he operates my mum. 

I left the doctor's office and immediately felt awful. He had crossed the line. He stopped being professional and wanted to fuck me. I feel completely stupid and abused. He then called my mother and asked her to send me to his office again for another exam. Very angrily I said no. I feel awful, my body is completely paranoid, I feel mad with myself and also feel violent.
