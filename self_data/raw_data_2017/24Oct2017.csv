1,"Until he just showed up here to visit her and looked shell shocked.  He's also friends with one of my partners, whose house I was crashing at this weekend. He's got a very secluded yard, but no curtains.  And when people drop by they come down the driveway and knock on his window. 

So here I am passed out butt naked Sunday morning in plain view from the window when this kid, (can't be more than 20) knocks at the window because he needed a place to warm up mid bike ride. I grabbed the sheet, woke up my partner to get rid of the guy, and passed back out. 
Totally forgot about it. 

Then just now the guy showed up to visit my friend (I live with a bunch of people) and I answered the door, all friendly, howyadoin, and his eyes went wide as plates and he just mumbled hey and ran upstairs to find his friend. Normally he's pretty social towards me, so my brain was like ""huh?"" Until I remember that morning. 

It's funny, because I'm occasionally a bit of a nudist at home, and for all the time he's been at my house, he'd never run into me naked. And normally I don't care if people see me naked, (see statement about being nudist) but somehow because it was when I was sleeping in bed with my partner, it makes it weird.

Tldr, slept naked at my partner's house, may have traumatized an acquaintance.",24Oct2017,0

However, I've known people to apologize for their actions and lose respect because of it (by both me and others).  Likewise, I know people who have done many things warranting an apology, but they don't -- and I and others respect them because of it.

I realize this is the age-old question of whether you'd rather be respected [feared] or loved, but I'm having trouble reconciling the middle-ground I need for my career.",24Oct2017,1
6,"It seems like history professors, ironically, are the only ones who haven't caught up yet. I feel like every history professor I've had a class with has made his students use exclusively hardcopies from the library and bookstore, what-have-you, to get the information for their papers, and it's ludicrous.

Most of the books you find on the obscure topics you're making them write about are outdated now that new information has been brought to light on the subject. Secondly, we live in the age of information because we live in the age of the internet; we should be able to get our sources from the internet, period. Most of these guys don't want you to use internet sources because they don't want to take the 1.5 minutes or less to see if it's a credible one, OR they're just so stubborn and anti-culture that they won't take the time to learn how to use the database to see if it's a credible source, most colleges and universities have such a database and it's not hard to use. These is made even more relevant by the fact that professors in general expect more from students now that they have all the information in the world at their fingertips, succeeding in academia these days is harder than it has ever been. With this in mind, do you know how long it takes to go to the library, look at the library's database to find if they even have books on the thing your looking for, go find them, go through them to see if they are of any use to you without a search bar to find keywords, go put them back when you have no need for them, and then check them out, read through almost the whole thing hoping to find something useful to your paper and then type whole quotes from them without a copy paste function? Not to mention the chance that you lose the book or have to get it back before the paper is even due.

Seriously, I know what a god damn book is, I know how to use it, I know the potential benefits of being able to research without the internet. But how often am I going to be without internet when everyone has a smartphone and there's a Starbucks and McDonalds on every corner? Learn to adapt and stop clinging to the way things USED to be done, you're causing your students more trouble than good. This is not a learning experience for them, they already know how to do it, it just takes way more time than necessary, and thats extremely inconsiderate to students with 12 or more hours of classes a week especially since it's not like they have a choice, most institutions require history as a gen-ed requirement to graduate. So please stop it, at least allow them to have half-and-half.",24Oct2017,1
7,"This is the long version of the account. Condensed version posted in /r/Vancouver

TL;DR: Friend got scammed in Kits roomshare. Police pulled out of sting operation last minute. We still managed to recover the loss by confronting the scammer.

Using a fresh account because the parties involved are under moderate threats of frivolous lawsuits, including me. 

This is a rather long story that was originally documented for the authorities. I decided to type up a version without the sensitive information to raise awareness, record keeping, and of course, for your enjoyment.

In my adulthood, I had lived in Asia for a few years where the English language is often taught, but rarely practiced. As a result, travellers coming out of this country don't always have the necessary language skills to survive elsewhere. In those few years in Asia, I met this friend, whom I shall refer to as ""Peter"" when we briefly lodged together in a dormitory-style housing. Peter is an adventurous person, having travelled to many other Asian countries on a whim, usually without proper preparation, and sometimes even without proper VISAs. As he recounted the experiences to me, we had a good laugh, but in reality, I was amazed at how he actually stayed afloat and not be in some kind of trouble after so many close calls.

Since my departure from Asia, we had fallen out of touch for a few years. One day Peter informed me on Facebook that he was coming to Vancouver. Peter was fortunate enough to have acquired a short-term working VISA. I was living a relatively laid-back life with gainful employment since my return so I offered to take time off to help him get settled into this wonderful city. Prior to his arrival, I began to confirm his flight and accommodation details and realized that he did not have any place lined up. I was a little bit surprised at first and insisted that he at least book a low-cost AirBnB for a few days before finding a proper room for the long term. Being Peter, he only booked his temporary accommodation while he was in the airport waiting to for his flight to YVR. 

Within the first few months, I helped him move 3 times when he first switched from a backpacker hostel in Downtown, to a renovated house-sharing property in Burnaby, and finally to his current accommodation in Vancouver. He had nothing but complaints against the housemates and the management, and perhaps all legitimate. After all, his budget of 500-600 / month for a room will only get him that kind of quality in this disgustingly-inflated housing market. 

About a month ago, he messaged me about having concerns about this new room he was looking into, that the owner was absent from Canada. I asked him to forward me the correspondence so I could at least translate for him what was going on. It turned out to be a scam after a quick google search with the details from the email. The advertised location was nothing more than some stolen photos of a property being listed for sale. The absentee owner’s photo turned out to be a profile picture form plenty-of-fish dating website. I stopped Peter dead in his track and relayed all the findings and a website that described the scam EXACTLY down to the words of the script. He was floored by the information because on that day he actually went to the location and checked out the building exterior. Even though he couldn’t confirm the interior, he was actually preparing to wire the rent and deposit to the scammer in order to receive the key and FOB by courier.

I take pride in being a Vancouverite, so I was happy that I was able to thwart the scam and patted myself on the back for stopping my friend from losing $1700. I educated him on the scams that typically goes on in Canada and asked him to be more diligent in his research. Although scams are not atypical in his origin country, Vancouver could easily be hell for someone of his tranquil upbringing. 

2 weeks later, I had gotten busier with some transitions in my life and only kept in touch via Whatsapp here and there. Now Peter had acquired employment and was earning a survivable wage. Although he still had a constant gripe with the housemates not being respectful in terms of noise and cleaning the communal space. He was desperate to move out ASAP and had already put in his notice to move before actually having found a new place. He asked my help in reviewing some of the info from a lease he is looking at. 

He forwarded me the emails and described his account:

A few days ago, Peter saw an ad on Craigslist for a Vancouver West side room share for $700 a month near Kits Beach. The location is close to downtown where he loves to frequent and close to his employment. He proceeded to contact the scammer, which we will refer to as “Scammy.”

Through email, Scammy requested Peter to provide a phone number and called him for a brief background check. It was then decided that they could met on in the afternoon at a Starbucks in the area. When Scammy arrived at the Starbucks, he told Peter that he needed coffee and extended the gesture to also buy Peter a drink. Peter had the orange juice. 

Peter described Scammer as an old man in his 60s, spoke with an accent, and was articulate. Scammy described himself as Italian, married, and living with his wife in Richmond. After the treat at Starbucks, Scammy proceeded entered the property with Peter using his FOB and key. Everything was checking out so far.

Now the building is a giant development that took on the shape of a “specialty Nintendo screwdriver bit” that housed hundreds with a spectacular beach-facing view near Kitsilano Beach. Scammy and Peter went up the elevator and arrived at the suite. Inside the apartment was a living room, and a bedroom. The living room had some garage piled on the side, as if someone had done some cleaning. The bedroom was meticulously tidy, lightly-furniture, although a bit dated. Scammy promised that he would upgrade the furniture inside the bedroom for Peter. Scammy asserted himself as the owner when Peter asked. They both understood that this was a room share lease, where someone would reside in the living room. Scammy told Peter that Peter could choose from the 3 candidates for future housemate – a Swiss girl, a German, or a Fin. Scammy also jacked up the rent to $750 for any lease shorter than a year, which Peter couldn’t do due to his VISA. Peter fought for $700 for 6 months as it was advertised and Scammy agreed that he would lower it only because he loves the ethnicity of Peter’s origin. Despite Peter’s language barrier, Peter was certain to push on the move-in date of November 1st, because any later would leave him homeless.

Right inside the apartment, Scammy drew up a hand-written contract and wrote a receipt for the deposit. Scammy insisted that Peter pay the deposit right away to secure the room. Desperate, Peter obliged, but he was lacking cash as his financials had been taken a hit with his excursion down south a week before. Scammy went as far as accompanying Peter to a TD bank to withdraw the $300 from using his foreign bank card, then to another ATM to withdraw another $20. Coupled with the $40 dollars cash on-hand, Peter was able to make the deposit of $360. Also on the contract, Peter was supposed to pay for the first and last month of rent totalling $1400, where $1000 was to be delivered in cash the following week, and $400 five days after that.

Now out of all his cash, with two illegible pieces of hand-written documents in his hand, and the impending deadline of $1000 and $400, he finally felt he was in trouble, but to the full extent. His next pay cheque of just a little over a thousand would only be issued to him when the $1000 installment was due and could only be cleared 4 days later.

Peter reached out to Scammy to question the unreasonable prepaid rent and appeal for an extension, and Scammy was not happy and replied with a lot of manipulative arguments on “trust”, “commitment”, and “credibility”. Scammy even offered to show Peter how to do payday cheque cashing. Peter felt distressed and finally asked me to review the situation.

The day after receiving the documentation, I finally had a chance to take a look at it and realized how everything was – for a lack of a better word – FUBAR. The receipt had virtually no information on it, to the point where the amount paid $360 was barely legible, because it should have been $350, but Scammy had no change, so had to alter the amount. The name was signed “Scimmy”, supposedly another alias he usually identifies with. The contract didn’t even contain the unit number OR the street number. Peter had to find it via Google map as he retraced his steps. However on the contract, after “Skimmy” was signed, it was overwritten to say “Scammy”. There was no ID information and not even a last name. The biggest insult was that Scammy wrote down “end of November” as the possession day, which would leave Peter homeless for a month.

As I questioned Peter on each particular detail, I could feel Peter shrinking smaller and smaller in shame on the other end of the Whatsapp conversation. 

The following day I called up a Google search result from the address of the building, which later I realized that Peter couldn’t find because he used BING. (life and death right here, boys and girls) The management company from the search quickly confirmed that there were only 2 units available in the property. When I asked about the particular floor, the lady hesitated and asked, “Has there been an issue with the unit xxxx?” She told me that there have been many complaints against this particular individual and it was likely a scam. When I described the situation and confirmed the alias, it turned out Scammy (or Scimmy) is middle-eatern and never married. We didn't even have the correct spelling of his nickname. He lied just about everything to Peter. She gave me the phone number of the owner/operator of the building who had been dealing with Scammy. The owner called back told me that the individual is a habitual liar and he had falsified a number of things on his rental application, claiming to be a PhD senior researcher at a local university. Scammy was only a problematic tenant that had been numerous complaints against him targeting international students, and particularly someone of Peter’s ethnicity. What the owner couldn't understand was that even if Scammy was able to lease it out for that price he advertised, he could barely turn a profit. The owner confirmed, there was to be no sublease within the building for security reasons. He had been living inside the living room this entire time, while peddling off his own bedroom. I inferred Scammy M.O was to actually rent out the good room and continued to stay in the living room, citing the European tenant candidates backing out and that alone was enough to weird out the new sub-tenant and drive them out, forfeiting their 2 months + deposit. They could only pursue him in civil course for the money, a 6 months process that short-term VISA holder cannot afford.

I drove over to Peter’s place and called into VPD non-emergency to start a case. Surprisingly after the case was numbered, VPD wasn’t really interested in hearing the details until an officer had been assigned. Now Scammy was still under the impression that he will meet Peter to collect the $1000 in one day. I was antsy to receive some instruction from VPD. After a few more phone calls to add case information in bite sizes, one of the officers agreed that they could look into a sting operation to recover the $360. The next day, an officer called me to let me know that he was well-aware of Scammy and they had been trying to arrest Scammy a few times, but he was crafty and evasive in his scams. However, the officer believed that he could look into getting some bait money and set-up a sting for the meet-up. He believed that he could get Scammy indicted if they catch him with the money in hand and put an end to this scammer.

I had some concern, Peter, being lacking in English, had not actually received a final confirmation from Scammy for the meetup. I wasn’t sure if it was worth all our trouble if Scammy doesn’t show. So I pressed Peter to inform Scammy that he had gotten the money from his boss and wanted to confirm the meet-up. Peter had once again fumbled. He basically hit reply-all to the email thread he forwarded me, which exposed my name and email address to Scammy. Scammy first called to confirm the meet-up and emailed back asking why the email was forwarded and who it was forwarded to. I had Peter reply, “To my friend, help me translate”. After all, it was a lot of money at stake and it would be reasonable to Peter to do his diligence. Lucky for me, I have a meticulous habit of tracking my own online presence. Outside of a single post requesting a referral code for a budget phone carrier, there was nothing else. It would appear that I am a young short-term stay guy who wanted to save money on phone plans, IF Scammy ever looked me up.

On the day of the meet-up, I decided to head to the Downtown location earlier and scout the surrounding just in case if we had to send Peter on his own with the bait money to reduce suspicion and nab Scammy right after he received the money. Sadly, about an hour before the meet, the officer from VPD called me and told me that he was unable to get the bait money with such short notice, and he had been reassigned to a different task for the night. There would be NO ONE to help us. He suggested that we somehow postpone the meet-up to Sunday evening at the Starbucks near the rental place. I believe the VPD had our best interest in mind, and was dreading that this ordeal had continued to drag on.

The meetup was to be in the evening at 6:30 and Peter and I arranged to meet latest 30 mins prior. Yet Peter arrived barely 10 mins before the meet-up. I explained the situation with VPD pulling out and asked what he wanted to do. It’s worth noting that I was informed by VPD that the individual is not known to be violent, and took pride in his ways of scamming. From Peter, I knew that Scammy was also old and had weak eyesight. His writing suggested he didn’t have good fine motor control. The meeting location had a stream of public traffic and very visible usually with police on patrol at this time of the evening. If things go sour, Peter and I could just escape on foot. I left the final decision to Peter.

Peter believed that the day would be the last we will ever see of Scammy and the only chance to get his money back. As we headed up the escalator to the ground level, I asked Peter in his native tongue to stand far back. We would be intentionally late. I asked Peter to email him, “I am almost there”. This would give us a bit more time to observe him and put us in the offensive with the element of surprise. Peter all of the sudden seemed to have become very assertive. When I told him to stop walking while he typed out the email, he kept on walking. I asked him where he was going, he said he wanted to stand at the pedestrian crossing with the other dozen people to see if Scammy was there. Peter said that he could blend in with the crowd very well. I told him that’s not cool and he needed to follow me RIGHT AWAY because I believed that Scammy would take the bus and the footpath from the bus stop would lead him right our current location. I wanted to move as far back as possible, so I made an angry gesture at Peter to “GET OVER HERE” and started to walk away. When I turned back after 3 paces, I saw Scammy standing with Peter. Peter stuttered, “Oh hi, I … I ..was message I almost there..then I cross” Scammy didn’t really notice me, possibly due to his poor eyesight and that I was facing the different direction. Our cover was blown and I had to wing it. I set aside my anger for Peter and went straight up to introduce myself to Scammy. I explained that I was there as the translator because Peter didn’t speak much English. Scammy replied, ""..it’s good to have a translator"", probably because he had also been frustrated with Peter’s English.

Scammy asked, “Have you got the money?”
Peter was still in shock and was unable to respond. 
I interrupted, “Yes, he has it” (which we didn’t)
Scammy quickly moved on with his plan, “Let’s not do it here. Let’s go to Staples.” 
Perhaps he was also afraid of getting robbed with $1000 on him in front of the Skytrain station. 

As we walked across the block to Staples, I attempted some small-talk to loosen Scammy up, removing some of his suspicion from the forwarded emails. 

As soon as we walked into Staples, I felt sorry for the store and the patrons for what was about to go down, but I was not going to hold back. There were about 5 customers waiting at the counter to for the printing service and about 4 service staff behind the counter. Things couldn’t possibly escalate out of control, I thought.

We stood just inside the door. Scammy asked, “So do you have the money?”
“Can you make a receipt?”, I delayed. 
“Yeah, I can do a receipt”, Scammy shrugged.

I quickly explained, “We are here today, because we found out that you are illegally subleasing your apartment. We would like you to return the deposit.”

There was a confused look on Scammy’s face. He turned to Peter, “….So you don’t want the room?” 
Peter looked at me and said nothing. 
“He doesn’t want the room”, I insisted. 
Scammy seemed not to be able to grasp what was going on and repeated to Peter, “You don’t want the room?”
“He doesn’t want the room, and I know you shouldn’t be subleasing your room anyway”
Scammy suddenly said, “If you don’t want the room, I can return the deposit to you. What is all this? Are you playing some kind of game? You could have just told me you didn’t want the room in the email. Why did you ask me to come out here?”
“Can you return the deposit now? ”, I asked.
“I don’t have cash on me”, Scammy still had his hands in his blazer pockets.  “How about you give me your bank information and I could do it tomorrow.”
I was unsure of whether giving that information out would do any damage to Peter, so I pressed, “You could an e-transfer with Interact to Peter’s email address, which you already have.”

“Because of my eyes, I can’t use a smartphone. I can’t do that”, all of the sudden Scammy muttered quietly.
I asked Scammy for his ID, so I know who he is, as per requirement for any contract, he flat out refused. When I offered to show him my ID, and he retorted, “I don’t give a fxxk who you are.”

“If you don’t want to give me the bank information, you don’t get your deposit. I have nothing more to say. Goodbye to you, FXXKER.” The expletive turned some heads in the store, although they had already been listening in on us since our grand entrance. 
Scammy proceeded to walk out the door.
There’s no freaking way that I was going to let Scammy walk out without leaving behind some paper trail. I followed him out. “So you will refund the money if we give you the bank information?” I was weighing the risk of giving out personal information against the benefit of getting the money back that night.

Scammy turned around and started to lecture me on how scammy I was that I had pulled a bait-and-switch on him and repeated that I was playing a petty little game. He said he knew something was up when the apartment owner talked to him yesterday morning and mentioned some “Japanese boy” He proceeded to tell me that he was suing the company TWICE. 

I basically ignored what Scammy said, and pressed for him to write an I.O.U to Peter for the $360. He said he wouldn’t do that, but he surprisingly agreed that he would write it on the back of the initial deposit receipt. I flattened the receipt on the concrete handrail ledge for him as he took out his pen. He could barely see in the poor lighting and after putting on his reading glasses and he still had to squint at it from a meter out. He quickly scribbled down “To be refunded on future date at 4pm, illegible signature” Peter took this chance and got a pretty good video footage of his face and him signing the note. 

“There you go, Motherfxxer. Now fxxk off!!”, but apparently, he didn’t want us to go yet as he had something to say to me and really got up to my face. He started to rant about how he was suing everybody. He was also very insistent that he could prove his prowess to me by emailing me the document he served the management company. I took the cue and told him that I could write down my email for him and took out my phone (and pressed record) but then quickly told him, “Yeah, the concierge had already told me that yesterday” and casually pointed the rear camera at him with my hand hanging down my sides. 
“You already know? Then you fxxking know I am serious”

He continued to rant about how he deserved respect where I had shown him none. I went on to basically compared him to a scammer without actually calling him one, asking him to put himself in Peter’s shoes and think about what he would do if he came face-to-face with a scammer.
That pushed him over the edge, a string of expletives came out of every sentence, and soon enough, every single word contained some sort of cursing. I placed my right hand up in front of my chest and smiled at him, left hand still recording, trying to redirect the conversation topic and get more video footage. From time to time, I would lightly tap him on his arm with my right hand. I knew I was half-trolling at this time. In my oversight, I was recording at 4k and only got a 5 min footage out of the whole tirade.

When he finally had enough and angrily said to me in a shaky voice, “If you call me SCAMMER again SIR I shall put my fist to your face.” His fist clinched and trembled from anger. I glanced down at his trembling fist with a smile as his face was within kissing distance.

All of the sudden, a man dressed in light purple shirt came out, possibly seeing that something was about to go down. He had a confused look on him and asked what was going on. Scammy turned to him with relief, and pointed at a camera at the entrance. “I am not afraid to show my ID to him, because I have NOTHING to hide. I am glad there is a camera here!” I took it as his consent to being recorded even though we were in a public area with no expectation of privacy. I had to be careful though. He likely will refund the money.

The man from Staple was confused about why he was being shown an ID. Scammy proceeded to walk away, as he was on the ground level, he didn’t stop with describing me as a pile of excrement. At least a dozen people walked by and did a double-take at us. I only focused on reaffirming that the refund WILL happen if we email the bank information, for which he always answered, “OF COURSE and I am going to sue YOU and YOU”, pointed at Peter and I. I smiled, as usual and gesture with my hand for him to simmer down.

After Scammy had left, the man in purples shirt gestured for us to enter the store. Scammy came at the door again, and held out his ID and said, “This is my ID, I have NOTHING to hide. You piece of Shxt, Fxxk you!” He flashed it so fast, I couldn’t get a good look. The man in purple went towards the door with his both of his hands in front of his chest and signaled for him to calm down as he soft-shoved him out the door. 

I took this chance to announce to the store, “This has been about a rental deposit scam and we’re trying recover the loss” A few ladies had an ""OH"" look and continued with their business. The man in purple came back, and I told him the summary of what happened and what info we had on Scammy from all the parties. He was stunned and mentioned that Scammy comes into the branch very often and he recognised Scammy right away. The man stood there rubbing his chin for a good 30 seconds without saying a word. Maybe that was why Scammy wanted to use the place, to produce more witnesses to aid his narrative. Only this time, he completely lost control and became the villain. 

We thanked the man as he went back to work and we headed out the door. 

On the SkyTrain, we received an email from Scammy saying that he wanted to finish the transaction that night, and wanted us to provide the bank info right away. We found the closet TD bank and obtained the banking information. The teller was hesitant but assured us that nothing could be taken out of the account with just those 3 numbers, although they could never recommend giving out personal information like that. At that moment, I had decided that it was worth the risk, since we could always close the account to prevent future activity. I got on the phone with VPD once again while I asked Peter to monitor his account online for the deposit. But he forgot his password and wasn’t paying attention to his emails.

When I grabbed the phone from Peter, I saw that there had been 3 emails from Scammy asking why we were so slow in responding and he wanted to finish this before the branch closes. We had 10 minutes left until closing. Scammy was also confused about how much the deposit was, asking whether it was $375 or $385. It was at this moment that I realized the transfer would actually happen for sure. 

Being honest, we replied $360 and asked Scammy to send a confirmation when it was done. 

Now you ask how did Scammy send emails while he was in the TD Downtown branch? Yep, a smartphone. The guy was full of lies.

At 7:52, the tellers were prepping to close. We camped out at the counter as the teller refreshed the account info. He told us that in-branch transfer would be instantaneous and he saw nothing yet. After 20 mins wait, VPD had just confirmed over the phone that they agreed with the teller, and advised us that we close the account if the deposit does not go through today. 

At 7:55, the long-awaited deposit of $360 came in. The three of us let out a squeal and did the hand pump. The teller printed out the statement and scheduled for Peter to close the current account and  re-open a new one as soon as he was available. 

This ended my long and strange night. I am still digesting the details of what actually happened and what was going through the scammer’s mind. I am still moderately upset at Peter, thinking perhaps he deserved to lose the $360. Before he left TD, he was able to take out some cash for food. 

I went home and lost sleep that night.

TL;DR: Friend got scammed in Kits roomshare. Police pulled out of sting operation last minute. We still managed to recover the loss by confronting the scammer.

9,"And to be honest, I'm not 100% secure in my race. I'm black, I have no shame about it. But I don't know that I'm at the level of pride about it that my peers are at.

There's a lot of good things that black people have done in this country. We've come a long-ass way. I'm proud to be a part of a race that's done so much. But my peers are very overt about it, and I prefer to be more lowkey.

But I think people are starting to think I hate being black because I don't talk about it very often. I don't go out of my way to make black friends, or consume black media. I don't go to protests, or go to bat on Facebook or IRL whenever some injustice happens to a black person. 

I feel disconnected from the black people around me as a whole. As individuals, I know some of them quite well, but on the group level I feel like they see me as just self hating.

 I've had people ask me why I don't to specifically black events, why I don't watch Dear White People or whatever that fucking show with Issa is. They tell me ""You should've been at Black Girl Meetup"". ""You should have read that book on African American History"". 

Say that to me again! Do it! Because at the end of the day you're really telling me that I'm self-hating if I don't do what you think I should. When you do that, you're no better than the years of laws and customs that told us that to be ""good negroes"", we had to hate ourselves the way Master wanted us to. Otherwise we were just uppity negroes that deserved to be dead.

There are black people among us that really do work contrary to us and openly dislike us. That's not me.

11,"tl;dr: Sears is making me realize how much it must have sucked before fridges were a thing.

My late father was a loyal Sears customer for most of his life. Whenever the family had to make a major home purchase (appliances, lawn care equipment, snow blowers, etc), Dad always went to Sears first. When my husband and I decided we wanted to upgrade our fridge last spring, we went to Sears.

Huge mistake.

Our fridge was delivered in July of last year. On October 1st of this year, it died. We first noticed it when we realized that the freezer was no longer freezing (and that everything in it had defrosted and most of it had to be discarded). On Monday, October 2nd, I called Sears. I had purchased the extended warranty on the Fridge so the repairs would be covered. I was informed when I called in that the earliest repair appointment I could get would be on the following Tuesday. I was shocked that the delay was over a week, but scheduled the appointment.

The next day, we realized that it wasn’t just the freezer part of the fridge that wasn’t working and I called back in to say that the entire fridge was now non-functional. They assured me that I was on the list for “emergency service” in the event of an opening, but that they couldn’t come out any sooner than Monday, October 9th. I rescheduled my appointment to take this earlier timeslot, thinking that the repairman would come out on the 9th, repair my fridge and I’d be up and running. A week seemed like a long time to go without a fridge, but it was only a week.

The 9th rolled around and my repairman arrived slightly early to the appointment (which was nice) and was very personable and efficient. He efficiently told me that the compressor was bad on my fridge (this model, I was told, is known to have this problem) and that it would have to be replaced. He did not have the compressor available, it would have to be ordered. My hopes of a single week with no fridge were crushed. The part, he said, would arrive at my doorstep in 3-5 business days and he would return as soon as possible to install the new part and test to see if there was a leak in the system.

As soon as possible, it turned out, was Tuesday, October 24th. Two weeks. Two more weeks without a fridge. But my warranty/extended warranty was covering this repair! That’s something, right? Apparently my warranty would have covered the purchase of a compact fridge (up to $160, but I wasn’t informed of this at the time.) So I bought one on my own.

So, my part should arrive in 3-5 business days, he’ll return in 2 weeks to install it. Easy peasy, right?

Wrong.

Six business days later, the part has not arrived at my door. In fact, I’ve gotten no communications from Sears whatsoever. So I call the number on the receipt for service that the repairman left me. Turns out the parts for my fridge are on backorder, there are two parts necessary for this repair and both are on backorder. One will ship on October 24th, the day I’m supposed to have my fridge fixed, and the other has no available shipping date. 

At this point I’m told that if the part remains on backorder for 15 days, they will declare that my fridge isn’t reparable and will replace the entire unit. So I begin to wait.

I called to check the status of my parts order this morning, one part to ship tomorrow, one part still with no date in sight. Now, I’m feeling pretty salty. I’ve already gone out and bought a dorm fridge, which my family (four people) is currently living out of. I’ve lost most of the contents of my original freezer/fridge because by the time we realized anything was wrong with it, it was already well below temperature. (Apparently I am entitled to reimbursement for those vanished goods, which would have been nice to know the first time I called in so I could have more thoroughly documented the loss, it has after all been more than three weeks now. But I found this out today, on a hold message, during a very long hold.) 

I called the warranty hotline to discuss replacement of my fridge, I realize that the parts have not been on backorder for a full 15 days (that would be tomorrow, I believe). I was told they would not discuss replacement until after the full 15 days have elapsed. Which would we fine, if we could expect timely delivery of the part and timely installation. About two hours ago, Sears called (the first contact they have made with me since the confirmation of my first appointment, they didn’t even inform me of the backorder, I had to call to find that out.) They have cancelled tomorrow’s appointment (which makes sense, considering that I don’t have the necessary part to actually fix my fridge.) They rescheduled my appointment for November 7th. Two more weeks.

Five weeks with no fridge. Now, my fridge is only about 15 months old. My 15 month old fridge has suffered a catastrophic failure leading to the loss of what was in it at the time and the inconvenience of living out of a dorm fridge for the foreseeable future.
Sears’ solution to my problem:
1 week before original repair visit
2 weeks between 1st visit and installation/repair (cancelled)
2 more weeks before installation/repair and test
If further parts are required how long am I expected to go without a fridge?

My solution to my problem: Come take this broken fridge away, replace it with a new fridge of the same make/model. Repair the old fridge on your own time and sell it as a refurbished fridge. It’s almost brand new.

I am beyond dissatisfied with the service I have received from Sears. I will not hesitate to speak about the terrible service timeline this company has foisted on me. I will not hesitate to discourage everyone I know (and strangers on the internet) from doing business with Sears if this is the quality of service that is offered by this company.

13,"Hi r/self, 

Originally I posted this in r/relationships, thinking that that sub would be more appropriate, but my post got removed and I was told to come here. All the responses I got from that sub were trash anyhow.

Ever since high school I've dreamed of having a girlfriend. And all throughout that time, I've had several girls come and go in my life, and opportunities to start a relationship with those girls come and go with them. In high school, a very pretty girl held an interest in me for all 4 years, and though we definitely grew closer by our final year, I didn't make a move despite her giving me many hints she wanted me to. I just never felt ready. I never felt confident enough in myself. I was afraid of what would happen if the relationship went sideways, and I just didn't trust myself enough at my level of maturity then to face all the good, and bad, that relationships entail. She ended up finally reconnecting with her ex and going to prom with him instead. That was almost 3 years ago.

Fast forward to this summer, and an older girl acts all flirty and kisses me at a wedding. I'm flattered and overwhelmed, but I don't know how to reciprocate those feelings. She flies home, and though we still keep up with each other, our relationship went nowhere. For weeks I was extremely disappointed, partly in myself, but I've come to terms with it now.

My experience with this girl made me more confident in myself. She reminded me that it's ok to live life, and gave me some important experience with being intimate with somebody for the first time ever. And I was left wanting more - how could I not?

I'm in college now and there's this one girl whom I see often in class. We're about the same age, and unlike the other girls I've met, she seems pretty down-to-earth. We sit besides one another about once a week, and there's been a lot of physical flirting. Though it may seem silly to some, we've said so much without actually talking. We've grown close such that she's come to sit very physically close to me every time we get the chance to (think lots of side glances, moving papers in a way that allows her to lean close to me to write something down), or making sure to get to that one spot early so that we can sit beside one another. And every time we sit with one another, when class is over, she and I will both linger after everyone's gone - hoping that one of us will break the silence and say something to one another. She's waiting for me to do something, and I know it. I don't want that window to close again.

I know I've been wrong before, but something about this girl just feels *right.*

Obviously, and my mom has already told me to do this, I must get to know this girl better first, to talk to her more, and to start by making a friend. But I've held back.

The thing is, at this age, I'm so ready for physical love and intimacy (this is what I want more than anything in the world right now) - I've taken care of my body up to this point, I take pride in my appearance and dress, etc. - but I don't know if my mind is ready. I've grown so much after all these years of observing these would-be relationships and I've grown to understand who I am more, but I still have many doubts. What if she finds me boring as we get to know one another better? Will I be able to pick myself up if things were to go wrong between us - can I handle heartbreak responsibly? Am I ready to open up to someone and show them what I'm really like?

I know in many ways I'm ready for love. I grew up in a household of women, so I feel confident that I know how to treat a woman right. I'm prepared to give a girl my all and to respect her, protect her, never hurt her (especially physically), and to make her feel valued and loved like never before. But I also don't know what that means, and I think that's what really holds me back.

It's fear of the unknown and of screwing up since I've never been in a relationship before and also, I suppose, me trying to get reward without any risk. Maybe it's just time for me to man-up.

Am I wrong to want this right now? I'd be grateful for advice right now.

tl;dr: I feel ready to have a relationship with a girl but have many doubts about myself entering a relationship. How do I know when I'm ready?",24Oct2017,1

I had been having a very rough day having to deal with my ex who I broke up with a few weeks ago, as well as my friends who never seem to want to talk to me when I need advise, so I was kind of a mess when I was driving to the gym and I didn't realize how fast I was going and I tried to take a turn going 80 when you should only take it going 45, I ended up rolling my truck 5 times and smashed it into a tree. I guess I am pretty lucky cause I only got a concussion, 4 broken fingers, 2 cracked ribs, and a broken nose.

18,"I may or may not have killed my own dog when I was little. It's hard to remember, and I think part of me is supressing it. It was sort of a accident, but when I think about it  my heart rate goes up and I start to hyperventilate and cry. My mom said that we never owned that dog, and I want to believe it, but part of me says it's true. We had Maltese and Yorkie (Berry and Zoey), but I think there was a another maltese dog named Baby that I may have killed by picking up and throwing on concrete outside our house multiple times until he was twitching and I called my mom outside and I said something was wrong with him while feeling worried I can't remember after that. I may have been 5 or 6 at the time.

I own a dog now and would never want anything to happen to him, but everytime I think about it I fight in head about whether I did or didn't. My Mom isn't the type to lie for my feelings and I think we didn't own animals until we moved to an apartment complex (I can only remember the 2 other dogs being at the apartments), but the memory takes place at the housr befor moving,  so it's a high possibility it never happened, but part of me feels like it did the memory feels real.

It’s just, my first instinct is to go out of my way to make life easier for those around me, or to help out wherever I see a need.

Is there anything I can do to not feel like I’m being used? ",24Oct2017,1
21,"I don’t know where to start or if somebodies actually going to read through this. I just got off a 20 minute phone call with my mother in which I might have hardly spoken for about 5 minutes. But the phone call made me realize that I’m actually worthless, useless and there is no point to my life. 

I just turned 17. I lost my father last year in November. The cause being illness. My father before that had gotten into alcohol and used to drink way too much everyday. So much that he lost that consciousness and would be very drunk almost all the time. That made him very abusive towards my mother and sometimes me. My parents have had a very difficult past, abusive and everything wrong that could possibly happen with a married couple. My brother moved out to study abroad in 2015. 

And since the moment he left is when everything started to fall apart. Because that’s when my mother started cheating on my father and he found out. That’s when he got into alcohol and days and nights for my mother and I became horrible. That’s when I failed to realize that my dad needed help and not the self defensive thing my mother and I were doing. That’s when it got too much and I suggested for him to go to the rehab. That’s when he stopped eating and drinking water and became unhealthy. That’s when all of the illnesses he had since birth took a violent turn and took his life. My fathers last word was the name of my mother. I’ve always known that he really loved her but didn’t know that over protectiveness was something I think my mother hated and she needed love which he didn’t know how to give. 

My parents had always been very abusive towards one another and somewhere it affected us, my brother and I. But my brother escaped and I’m left behind. I vaguely remember the fights. Because recently all I think of is how I should’ve told my father I loved him and how there’s countless ways to end my life. Because I don’t deserve it when all I’m doing it hurting the people around me. 

My mom always tells the people around her about me. She tells them everything about me. I’m almost like an open book on a coffee table in middle of the damn road so that everyone can just come in and flip through the pages. I think she did that with my brother too but since he’s gone away now all that’s talked about him is how well he’s doing and how he’s the better child. I’m told how worthless I am over the phone. I’m told I killed my father because I suggested the rehab and that’s where everything went wrong. I’m told to die and I’m told how much she wishes she wanted me to die. I’m told how much she hates me. I’m told that if anything were to happen to her now it would be my fault. The 20 minute call that happened just now was my mother telling me just that. 

I think my grades fell when I was in the 7th grade. At least that’s what my mom keeps telling me and all the psychologists and psychiatrists I’ve been taken to and all the times I’m the topic of discussion. I don’t know how or why but they fell and they’ve been like that for a while now. I can’t concentrate. I can’t focus. I don’t know what i want to do in life. I do want to get out of this I want to become somebody but it just can’t. I don’t know what to do because everything I do takes wrong turn. I don’t feel like getting out of my house sometimes. I’ve gained a lot of weight too and I feel ashamed of myself. I feel ugly. I’ve been told these things. My mother tells me how ugly and fat I am. 

In the country I live in there’s a choice you have to make before entering high school. You can either take the sciences, humanities or commerce. The first year of grade 11 I took sciences because that’s what I’ve been told I have to take since I was little. I found none of the subjects interesting and missed a lot of days. I could do it if I set my mind to it because it wasn’t difficult but I just couldn’t. I had to repeat that year and now I’ve taken humanities. Once again I’ve failed to motivate myself enough to do something. I’ve failed to do anything. A week or two ago my mom got a call from one of her patients saying the school she is in is taking admissions for kids wanted to go in the science stream. She asked me and I was confused so I said no I didn’t want to. She managed to convince me later about joining and we went to the school. It was the last day or admissions and I needed to give them my the original copy of my schools leaving certificate. I didn’t have that so I couldn’t get the admission and my mother fought with me in the middle of the street and refused to take me home. The school is about a 30-45 minute walk from my home. She told me to get lost and something else I wish not to say and I walked home.  It was my birthday that day and like the last one it was ruined. Just a day or two ago was my uncles birthday and she had got a cake for him despite her busy schedule but didn’t for me. I wasn’t expecting any presents since I never get any. 

My mother and I fight almost every other day and I never get to say what I want because everything I say will be turned against me. I feel like I might go crazy. The people she talks to only want to hear one side of the story and have always turned her against my father which is why my father never liked any of my mothers siblings. They never want to hear what I have to say. My mother tells me I’m introverted, I don’t talk a lot. Introversion is a bad thing in my family or the society I live in I think. As for not talking much I never felt the need to speak much. She can talk everything about me and expect me to recite a poem in front of the people she sings my songs to. 

I feel worthless. 

I have a lot to say but no one to say it to. The “friends” I have would not be considered friends. I feel like I’m missing a few things to say but then this post would be way to long if it isn’t already now.  And I have self harmed before and thought about doing it again but I didn’t. I like reading, writing, music and art. I like crime novels and reading about people that have committed crimes it’s all very fascinating to me. Somewhere I think I want to become a forensic psychologist or a lawyer. But that thought changes when I speak with my mother about my career choices. My mother is doctor and my father was too. My mother is also very demotivating and expects me to be motivated by all she’s saying to me. 

I want to get out. I want to make a life. A good one. I want to be normal and I want to do so many things. I just don’t know how to and nobody helps me. Nobody listens. ",24Oct2017,48
23,"So I live with 3 flatmates, my brother, his girlfriend, and a friend. Often my brother and his girlfriend are affectionate, to a point where I find it uncomfortable and generally annoying. I find general PDA annoying, but they take it to another level. They argue that it's not PDA because this is their home, and they can do what they like *in their home.*

They often do things I just find uncomfortable, like lying on top of eachother, kissing, and sometimes just general cheeky stuff like ass/boob grabbing and foot massages **in the living room.**

They constantly follow each other most places, randomly meeting in the bathroom if the other goes there, or the garage just before one of them is about to leave. 

I find this so annoying to the point where I always comment on it and tell them to stop, but my other flatmate has absolutely no problem with their ongoing affection.

24,"I had a bad day today. Among a few other, smaller things, I had to reject a girl today. As a guy that super-sucks because I know what its like to put yourself out there and it must be even harder when you're breaking the gender roles in the process. 

It was moderately unusual circumstances, and I tried to make it clear that she shouldn't take it as any kind of direct rejection of her attractiveness or personality. In short, I had thought she was 17, so I just never considered her as any kind of sexual option because I'm a legal adult. Turns out she's 18, but that didn't change the fact that I had never considered her as an option.

We had a nice long conversation, and I laid out my reasons for not wanting to go into a relationship with her in a pretty basic manner, and she seemed to understand them. She was very level headed throughout the conversation and multiple times mentioned how she has a history of being able to get over people quickly, so as far as I could tell, everything was going about as well as something like that can. We split and there was an amicable understanding of the circumstances.

Later in the day, she sends me a snapchat thats just black with the text saying something to the effect of ""You were really nice about it, and while I get what you said, I'm still confused."" Thanks? I being nice about a rejection is kind of an obscure superpower, but its something I guess.

We've been snapping each other every few hours back and forth. A lot of them are either black with text or a face shot with no text (I'm pretty much mirroring whatever she does).

I'm probably overthinking this, as I'm prone to do, but it just feels a little odd. A part of me thinks maybe I should have been a little harsher, which I hate to consider. The other part of me thinks this is still within the realm of 'normal' behavior, and she's just trying to retain an element of contact.

Our system has been nothing but a code of syntax and logic errors. For those who don’t agree or are skeptical with the notion let me just say, I know that what happened with Swartz back in 2013 was tragic and for some; disturbing but we have to accept the fact that Swartz was right, one way or another. ..

He was Right

I still can do something to make things better, i think, but it's really hard, even if i didn't felt this way.  ",24Oct2017,4
50,"By all accounts I have a great life. Married 20 years to an amazing woman, have two great kids, a fairly low stress but well paying job, and a good boss.  But... I just don't feel happy overall. This is a looong rant, but just feels like I have to put it somewhere. 

I grew up below the poverty line in a couple small cities, had a lot of troubles in school and ended up in a good bit of trouble. During school I was a not so smart nerd that got picked on a lot. A lot of people figured I was going no where, including my mother who said I would just be wasting money with university.  She was a dropout who got her GED and started community college when I was in grade 12.  Her study groups were people I went to high school with and I remember her telling me one day I couldn't come out of my room because she didn't want me to embarrass her in front of them. 

My family moved to a big city soon after highschool so my mom could attention university and she said that the only way they would support me in school is if I did a one year program she had chosen. I did it because I saw it as a way out (working part time to pay for it while they gave me a place to live) . I graduated and moved around the country for four years picking up contract positions in the field and saving some money.  I met the wonderful woman that is now my wife and we decided I would go back to school on my own terms. My social life was active but very dramatic, with me generally being the cause of the drama. With my wife's support, I finished my four year degree in computer science just as the dotcom bubble burst (damn). Still found a job, but it was lousy; I kept at it for a number of drama filled years though because it was still better than nothing, which is where my self worth was at. A friend from work gave me a good shake one day and told me to get out; he helped me find a temporary position elsewhere . When that ran out I had no choice but to face life and see what I could do.

I got a job in a good company and thanks to the health benefits I was able to access some help and was diagnosed with a mental illness (massive anxiety being a part of it).  My new boss was great.  He told me later that I looked beat down at my interview and he saw something in me. He knew I wanted more and encouraged me to go back to school part-time to expand my knowledge. I started classes again part-time a month after my second child was born.  I started getting help for my illness and things were good, just bits of drama here and there. One of my profs asked why I was doing undergrad classes and I was soon invited to the MBA program. The company announced they were closing down my office and offered me a transfer to head office where there is a slightly higher rated MBA program (both are minor league though). The wife was able to take a transfer and the kids hadn't started school yet so we went for it, saying 3-5 years to finish school part-time, then return home. 

Finished more undergrad business classes to cover the higher entrance requirements, took the GMAT, and got pumping on the masters.  Got a nice promotion at work and start working directly with the executive.  New good VP, he leaves a few months later; then got a good interim boss for a few months. New VP comes in, doesn't understand what I do and demotes me to reporting to a director. She leaves a few months later and good interim boss becomes new VP, things are good again. Reshuffle, get new VP and he is actually great. Unfortunately during all this and with school and family, my illness really kicks in hard, ended up taking some time off work after a few sudden dramatic moments. Good support from the executive except the CEO who just seems to think I am broken.  Got on some new meds and come back good and strong. Still doing grad school and finish up with honors grades. Started butting heads with CEO and he starts showing up in my cubicle on a regular basis. All my work is suddenly being questioned by him.  New VP steps in the middle and takes control, great guy but I know it's time to move on.

Just as luck would have it, a management position comes up at a sister company and the listing of requirements looks like it was based off my resume. I interview and nail it. 3 weeks later I am overseeing my new team. 

2 years has gone by. My boss is great (feel I got lucky this way for the last 10 years), the work provides a bit of challenge and my staff are awesome. Industry is boring but the money is quite nice. Having grown up poor we now make a very decent living and I feel content that way and don't live in debt. Kids have their own challenges in school, but we are actively dealing with them and it is working. Wife is still wonderful, sex is still great 20+ years on, lol. Things are good with parents after tons of counselling on both sides. 

I have made few friends since moving to this city, and many I have made were through school or work and just kind of faded into the woodwork over time. It's now 7 years since we moved here and we are unlikely to move back home as our careers have done better and the kids have settled in. 

My doctor and I felt I was doing so well that I could wean off my primary med (Abilify) but the withdrawal sucks donkey balls. Reports show that it can go on for months, yay.  Boss has been supportive and I feel good outside of specific withdrawal effects. Knowing what they are, I can deal with them. 

But... For a while now I feel zero interest in life. Since I finished the masters two-and-a-half years ago I have no energy. I get up, I go to work, I come home, watch TV,  take the kids to activities as required, and I go to bed.  Throw in a generous helping of sex as the only thing interesting right now.   Went to a concert I always wanted to see, felt meh about it, couldn't get excited. Feel lonely, but have gotten to a point where I am tired of being the first to reach out to friends.  I stopped texting first to see what would happen. I've only heard from one friend this month and he just sends memes every couple of days. Even when I do see them I am boring, with nothing to talk about anymore. 

I have everything I dreamed about as a kid. I am married to someone I still love after 20+ years, have two great kids and my family is not hungry.  We can afford to buy the kids decent clothes; our needs are covered and we have few wants. I proved to everyone that I could be something.  My illness has improved enough through therapy that my psychiatrist says I wouldn't receive the diagnosis these days. My family and I are fairly close now.  Tried volunteering, didn't do much for me except feel like more work. 

So what the Fuck is wrong with me? Why do I feel so empty with all of this? Why can't I seem to connect to people well enough anymore that they just want to be acquaintances rather than friends?  Should I start my crazy dramas again to make people like me? 

Would love to have conversations with anyone that wants to chime in. 

Tldr: middle-aged man has mid-life crisis.

51,"I've been on a few dates with a guy and it's been fun, but today I found out he's also been going on dates with other girl(s?). I'm not angry; I'm not thinking of confronting him or anything like that because we have only been on a few dates. But I'm wondering if it's worth my time? Because I was still interested in talking to him more except finding out that he's interested in multiple girls kind of turns me away. Should I just try to get over it since we're not even official or just drop him and let him date the other girls?",24Oct2017,1
52,"How is it we all have this ridiculous notion that we’re supposed to know everything that someone hasn’t told us yet? I see it so much within this “Gen Z” ht, we hold ourselves accountable to knowing information before it’s told to us to avoid the embarrassment of being uninformed. Especially within an environment where our level of mental capacity is now a deciding factor of alphas. We have gone from those who could chuck the most hay to now those who can recite Shakespeare’s sonnets without a stutter being more impressive. Which isn’t a flaw, just the development of structure in social settings. As a byproduct however, builds up a common policy around us that if you don’t know about something that your friends have been well informed about, you’ve been left out of the loop. Like you’re some mental outcast who hasn’t been working with society on with a common goal. You feel like the dumb*ss of the place because you missed an article. And in that, people feel isolated in a social gathering without other individuals even knowing it. It also makes those who were left out afraid to ask questions about society, because they’re afraid of the rejections of questions. I think that I’ve lost interest in this paragraph. Have a great afternoon. ",24Oct2017,1

I was very annoyed trying to quickly tell if I had any rare pieces. The sites jumble all the text in a block and you have to basically read every column to figure out if yours is anything. So here you go. :)",24Oct2017,8
