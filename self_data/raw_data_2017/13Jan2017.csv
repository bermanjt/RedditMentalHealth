1,"My sister has been dating her boyfriend for a few years now. They're both college freshmen and have been dating since 11th grade. Recently, a friend of hers went through a bad breakup, and she's been helping her friend through it. Her friend's ex has a new girlfriend who her friend totally antagonises. But my sister thinks that her friend's story is very similar to hers and is now beating herself up over it. 

The story:

Note: This part of the story took place in Middle School so really please take this with a pinch of salt. It's a lot of overreactions, hormones and inability to deal with emotions.

My sister (A) was best friends with a girl (B) and another girl (C). B had been crushing on a guy (D), for a long time, before A and B even met. D has a girlfriend who is not B. Despite the fact that he's taken, B is still obsessive and possessive over D. However, B and D remain good friends, albeit with several ups and downs. Months later, C develops a crush on D. B tries to protect C and tells D to be careful with his actions. D becomes frustrated with this comment as B is a very controlling friend and demands a lot from D. D tries to distance/end friendship with B. This part gets messy but basically they both handled the fight badly and bad things were said. B spirals into a depression, for which she blames D's distance. Naturally, D feels guilty and himself feels depressed. The two aren't friends. D becomes closer with C, whilst B and C drift apart. A and B remain close friends and B tells A about how shitty D is, the things he said to her etc. A is supportive, however A and D remain friends also.

Fast forward 6 months. A and B are no longer close friends, yet remain friendly and cordial. No fight took place, simply a drifting friendship. B no longer speaks to C or D. A and C are still best friends, however this friendship is short lived and A and C remain friends but become much less close in the following months. C is still crushing on D and the two are close friends. Over the course of the next year, D takes many actions that C perceives to be flirty/leading her on. She becomes upset over this, but nothing more than the sadness you feel over unrequited like in High School. Her crush is long standing.

A year later. A and B are friendly. A and C are friends but are not close. A and D are close friends. B and C are not friends with each other or with D. C claims to be over D but no one believed this. 

10 months later, A begins to develop feelings for D. She suspects that C still likes him and asks her if she does. C claims she doesnt and says ""don't change any actions for me, i'm over it"". C also proceeds to attend prom with another guy. Meanwhile, A and D at this stage are best friends and are attending prom together.

Another few months later, A and D begin dating. A once again talks to C about this, who states that she's completely okay with it. A does not talk to B as they have not been friends in approximately 2 years. 

Around a year and a half later, B brings up the relationship with A. B states that she felt ""betrayed"" by the relationship, as well as the friendship that was the pre-cursor, because A knew everything that D put B through and yet A still dated him. Moreover, C also liked D, so A screwed her over too. Yes C said it was okay, but A should have known she was lying.


My thoughts:
Now aside from B stating her thoughts, all of this happened a long time ago. You have no obligation to someone you haven't been friends with in 2 years. Also, just because they were mean to you, does not mean they are a bad person. My sister now knows D's thoughts on the fight between D and B, and still states that both of them handled it badly and were both at fault at different points. Also, A and D started dating 2 and a half years after the fight, and 2 years after the end of a friendship. And again, the fight happened in middle school!!! And C doesn't seem to play any role since she gave her blessing. If C was lying about that, how was A to know? And again, C and A were not close friends, yet A still asked. But then again, I'm biased.

2,"Posting here because there is no way this would be allowed on r/politics or political discussion.

Syria claimed they were just attacked by Israel, potentially accidentally. If some additional craziness went down right before the time of inauguration,  would Obama be allowed to not transfer power? I'm thinking something fairly extreme, like Syria and Russia full on invading Israel prior to the 20th.

I don't care about the likelihood or the realism the scenario, it is just an example, I want to know what legal authority the sitting President has to stay in power.

Thanks!",13Jan2017,1

8,"Hi reddit.  This is my first time posting here, as I was recommended to this sub after posting on /r/relationships.  This is going to be a long one (I'm so sorry), but I had to talk to someone about this, and I thought it was the best way to figure out any options I may have.  I'm at my wit's end.  Throwaway because it's pretty serious and while I don't know anyone who reddits, I can't be too careful.

Background:  I've always been pretty purposed - by this I mean, I strive to be successful.  It's not that I'm particularly motivated to do anything for myself, but I feel as though success itself means I must be doing well.  The problem with that is even through all of that, I still felt sad at the end of the day, sometimes having incredibly dark thoughts.

I have always had pretty severe clinical depression.  I was diagnosed when I was 17 and it started to make sense why I was sad all the time.  However, when I was diagnosed, I was also trying to get into a job field where I could NOT be on any antidepressants or any other prescriptions for mental illness whatsoever.  Long story short, I refused to get the prescription and never disclosed to anyone how bad my depression really is.

My freshman year of college, I was particularly sad.  Changing routines seems to mess with my mood, as I've noticed.  I quickly moved in with a girlfriend who ended up being emotionally and sexually abusive towards me.  It really did some damage to my self esteem and I felt stuck.  I felt as though I still loved her dearly and wanted to make things work no matter what.  She ended up cheating on me, several times.  Eventually I put an end to it, but we continued to live together due to our lease ending soon after the break up.  Closer to the lease ending, she started becoming apologetic towards me and told me she wanted to make things work.  More manipulation, and I fell for it.  Four days before the lease ended, my parents showed up to my doorstep saying that my gf called saying I'm suicidal and need to be taken to the hospital immediately.  Them knowing my mental health history, they did just that.  My ex, being the manipulator she was, convinced me it wasn't her so that I wouldn't disclose that she was also gay (her family is extremely Catholic).

After finding out more about me, that I am gay, my parents immediately cut me off.  They stopped giving me money for living expenses (I was on scholarship for academics) and since I was in student apartments, I had no where to go.  I ended up being homeless/sleeping on friends' couches for the majority of the summer.

I finally managed to find a decent paying job, but no benefits, and also landed a couple more scholarships/loans to cover books and day-to-day expenses, like food.  I was able to stay enrolled.

Long story short, I managed to finish college, get my degree, and I'm fairly successful in my job field.  I have a wonderful, patient girlfriend (long distance) and my friends &amp; family, minus my parents, have been incredibly supportive.

The only thing that has never changed was my depression.  These past holidays only made it worse, but I digress.

Now I moved many states away alone (2 years alone!) and have a fantastic job.  I am completely independent.  I also managed to (partly) mend the relationship with my parents and they are now completely supportive of the fact I am gay.  They decided to move closer to me as well.  My father, however, is a very ignorant person (for lack of a better term) and he commonly is very rude and blunt.  He also gets extremely angry. He told me that he realizes it's an issue, but wants to work on it.  I wanted to give him a chance.  Everything with them was on a good track until recently.  Both parents started making me feel equally guilty for not spending time with them and very unwelcome when I do see them.

On New Years, I spent the evening with my father and uncle.  My uncle is rather young, 18, due to my grandmother adopting a child at an older age.  He spends most of his time with us (story for another time).  Anyways, we decided we wanted to go out for dinner and drinks in the closest metro city (about three hours away).  I have the most reliable vehicle, so we drove my car with the premise that my uncle would drive home.  No problem - I wasn't planning on having much to drink but I never risk drinking and driving.  As the night continued, I was having a lovely time, and I drank a little more than I previously planned.  I also noticed that my father was incredibly intoxicated quickly and started asking rude, invasive questions but I would ignore it (not a huge issue, it's New Years so I tried acting like it didn't bug me too much).  Suddenly I received a call that someone broke into my apartment, but was caught and didn't take anything minus my Playstation 4.  I was on my phone for a good 45 minutes tops, and halfway through I let my father &amp; uncle know what was going on.  I stepped back out to finish the call and give my insurance company a heads up.  On returning to the bar, my father and uncle were gone.  I searched everywhere for them, and my phone was on 5% at that point after calling them both several times (unsuccessfully).  Nowhere to be found.

I finally decided I should try to track down my vehicle to see if maybe they were there.  The walk to my vehicle was about 20 minutes (and being somewhat drunk didn't help).  Again, nowhere to be found.  I finally received a drunken call from my father saying they're on their way home already, and they're not coming back.  He hung up and then soon after my phone died.  Here I am stuck in a city alone and I have no way of calling anyone.  At this point I'm annoyed and tired and my apartment was broken into.  It was well past midnight and I had no idea where the time went.  So I tried walking to a few hotels near me and they were all booked.  Finally, I found one and stayed the night.  I used the hotel phone to call myself a cab to take me home the next day (not cheap).

When I was back home, I found my car parked at my apartment with my keys in it.  I was pissed - so I called my uncle and asked what the hell happened.  He told me my father was irate and angry, so they just up and left (my uncle doesn't have much of a spine, he is supported mostly by my parents; also sort of close minded like my father).  My mother was on vacation, so she had no clue what had happened.  I blame my father 100% for what happened.  I never received an apology.  I told my mother the whole story when she returned from vacation, but supposedly my father had lied to her about the situation and she took his side.

I spent a little over a week trying to calm down about it all.  Eventually I decided that I needed to set limitations on my interaction with them.  I let them know that the situation and a culmination of rude and toxic comments/actions from my father caused me to want to restrict seeing them.  I sent them this in a text.  My father quickly replied and tried calling, saying I am overreacting and that I'm being a child about it all.

I never replied to him, and heard nothing from my mother for awhile.  My cousin, who I have not seen in quite some time, is visiting my parents.  I was best friends with my cousin growing up, and he really wants to see me.  Unfortunately, he doesn't have a car here and he has no clue about the situation with my parents minus the fact that I told him I'm not really on speaking terms with them at the moment.  We've talked, and he's planning on staying over a couple days during his visit.

Here's where the problem lies: my depression is getting incredibly worse.  It's starting to degrade some of the relationships with friends because I'm so sad I don't even want to leave home sometimes.  I also feel like it's causing me to act rudely or disrespectfully towards my girlfriend (she's been so patient with me, it's unbelievable).  I love her and my friends/family to death, but even that isn't keeping me happy.  I feel as though my presence in people's lives causes more issues than good.  My cousin has to tiptoe around my parents because of me, not to mention my parents basically act as though I'm a parasite.  My friends all usually have to travel long distance to see me (even when I get a break from work) so I feel like I take advantage of their friendships.  I know these feelings are probably just through my perspective, but they're all part of me feeling worthless and hopeless.  Even moving up in my job field doesn't interest me anymore.

I'm trying to focus on things that I enjoy, but I can't seem to get enjoyment out of any of it.  I can't eat much anymore, and I get anxiety attacks from simply going to the grocery or gas station.  The only things I look forward to are small plans I make here and there, but then they turn out to disappoint me anyways.

I'm to the point now where I don't even see a point of continuing on like I am.  If I were to be put on antidepressants, I would lose my job and dig an even bigger hole.  I can't talk to my parents, and my closest friends are too far away to do anything anyways.  My girlfriend is planning on changing jobs, so she's stressed out as it is.  I would hate for her to worry about me like that.  I'm stuck mentally and I have no clue where to go from here.  I have more and more frequent dark thoughts.  I'm not even sure seeing a mental health professional would do me much good - if I am hospitalized for those reasons, I lose my job.  This is strange to say, but I don't even feel suicidal in the common sense.  I don't want to put in the work and emotional fortitude for that.  I would rather just slip away in my sleep.  I know it won't come down to that or suicide, but I thought it was important to mention.

What do I do?  I feel emotionally exhausted.  I just want to be happy because of myself, regardless of the relationships I have in my life.  I want the depression to stop.  I don't even know what advice someone could have to help me.  I'm open to discussions.",13Jan2017,2

It just feels like things are not stable and something is about to boil over and I am concerned.  This is the first time I have ever felt insecure about the future.

She Is gone. My beloved lolove has left me. The pain can be overbearing sometimes. I try to forget her. I deleted all traces of her from social media. In case I stumble upon a snapshot of her life that she is happy with another man. I'm such a jealous man. Fuck I miss her. I really saw a future with her. And one night it all came crashing down on me. She left. I didn’t see it coming. She explained why, and I understand to a point. But my jealous nature is getting the best of me. I want to believe her reasoning. But I can't. She left me because she felt she was taking me down with her. But man. She was right and wrong.  
I feel love is when your there through the bad and ugly. I was prepared to be there for her. But she didn’t want me there. It hurts so bad. She saw the writing on the wall. She was more realistic about it I guess. I wanted, needed, it to work. She was the one. But life doesn’t play out that way. I don’t know what to take away from all this. I don’t eat, I don’t sleep. I don’t enjoy. I have small victories throughout the day that I just want to text her about. But no longer. I cling to the hope that someday we can reignite things at the right time and place. But I know that’s not what can happen. She will go to Carson brand new. Some guy will lift her up and make her happy and soon things will be ok for her. I want to wish her well thoughts. But god dammit she was fucking mine. I had to cut all communications with her for her own good. I want to be petty. But I cling to that stupid petty hope.  
 
I understand why she left. I really do. But doesn’t mean I like it. I just feel so stupid. Spending so much time and effort into her. But it wasn’t enough. And she played me. I tried to be transparent with her. What we were originally founded on. But it was too much and pushed her away. Why can't it ever be happy ever after? I'm cursed with this instinct to learn about the female intimately. And they always leave me. I know I have my faults, but what relationship is perfect? She fucking played me. She always referenced that day no one picked up the phone. So she called Logan. I never had the guts to ask her about the details. 
 
What difference does it make now. Every day is a struggle. I have flashbacks of memories with her and it hurts so bad. It comes out of nowhere. I try to suppress them quickly but the damage is already done. I just don’t understand why. I think I'm a good guy. Distance has always been a factor since I've been in the army. But it's such overwhelming odds. Im such a fool. I see people years younger than me happily married. I desperately want that. And I saw it with her. I tried so hard to keep her. But it wasn’t enough. It makes you question your compatibility. I gave her my all but it wasn’t enough. But she gave up god dammit.  
 
She was right though. So much has opened to me career wise since we split. I can go wherever whenever I want. But what's the point? I can't share these victories with anyone who would really understand. But I wanted to give that all up for her. Ive been down this path a few times. I just want a person I can trust to go home to every night. Someone to just hold and kiss while sleeping. Someone I know would be there in the morning to tell me. Hey, your going to do great today. Ill be here later.  I'm so sick of the endless cycle of meet, date, repeat. It leads nowhere. I just..... 
I want her back. Just to hear her voice. I hope that she texts me, but at the same time I hope she doesn’t. Just to know that she still thinks about me. But if she did it would hurt so bad. I'm trying so hard not to contact her. She wanted space to deal with stuff. She will never understand. My biggest fault is that I don’t truly open up until I'm at my breaking point. And then sometimes I lash out. Like I said no one is perfect. But this profession really doesn’t leave much space for you to talk about feelings and shit. We lead from the front. We have to be almighty so that in our darkest times they will follow. When all is lost we have to uplift and lead in the face of overwhelming odds.  
I want to be hopeful. But this profession makes you so cynical. It can't be. At the end of it all I just wish she would understand how hard I tried to make it work. It wasn’t easy. And I grew a lot as a partner, I think during the journey. I've been through quite a few break ups but this one hurts the most. She was the one. And she will never really know.  
I love you. I wish you luck. Maybe in the coming months I can recover and be stable enough to pick up small talk with you. Doubtful. But wherever you go, whatever you do. You will hold that special place in my heart. You filled that void I so desperately tried to fill myself. But when I was with you everything in the world felt so insignificant. We got lost in our own little world and briefly, forgot about our worries and troubles and genuinely enjoyed each others company. You are perfect. And regrettably, whoever you meet fulfills your happiness and needs that I couldn’t.  
Sweet dreams my beautiful lioness.

18,"Thanksgiving 2015 my step-dad was diagnosed with thyroid cancer but has been in full remission now for almost 9 months. Of course that's great. I wouldn't wish cancer on anyone, but I feel my mom, who has basically been his caretaker ever since his diagnosis, is being taken advantage of. 

In the 8 years they have been married he's always been somewhat demanding of her in helping with their small business and taking care of all the household responsibilities, but in the last 6 months that I have been living with them I feel like it has gotten worse. She does absolutely everything around the house (of course I take care of my own stuff, and help out with common chores) and goes out of her way to make sure he gets everything he wants. Whatever. But what bothers me is his reaction when things don't happen his way. 

Just today, a small example, I overheard him: ""Honey why didn't you bring my clothes up stairs?"" Dude they are in your hands right now and you are on your way up, why do you need to call it to her attention? To be fair I have never really gotten along with him (my two siblings and step-sister can't stand him and moved out as soon as they legally could) and they have sought counseling in the past. However, when the cancer was found my mom automatically assumed that was the cause for his behavior. But now it's like she feels obligated to do even more because he had cancer. 

It's been really hard for me to hold my tongue and watch him treat her this way, but idk what to do now. How are you supposed to treat a cancer survivor? Do they get a free pass to do whatever they want now? Do I confront my mom about her behavior? How? Or am I just being insensitive and unsympathetic? Thanks",13Jan2017,1

So... today's Switch Presentation. Watched it live at 5am. 

Was not convinced. Sorry. It wasn't all bad, not a disaster by any means. But it certainly wasn't all good either. And the things that were good more often than not came back-to-back with things that were not. 

---

First off, the biggest disappointment was of course **the complete no-show of SwitchVR.** 

There is no doubt Nintendo have been cooking something along those lines -- numerous industry analyst reports, leaks from credible leakers, established game devs and Nintendo licensees writing blog articles brazenly hinting at SwitchVR, and last but not least ***an actual Nintendo Switch patent*** are all testament to this. 

Now, I totally get why Nintendo may not want to make SwitchVR the focus, but not even mentioning it as a (future?) option is a **HUGE MISSED OPPORTUNITY**, and dare I say flatout ***weird for a system that supposedly takes pride in offering a wide array of 'play modes'***, including VR-style left-&amp;right-hand motion controls! 

---

--Further Notes--


---

**Also Sorely Missing** 

* **Metroid.** 

Even Emily Rogers had confirmed it's in the working for Switch. 

Oh well, maybe they're just keeping that for E³ 2017 -- along with SwitchVR... ***Metroid Prime IV VR***, anyone? T-T 


---

**The Launch Date: March 3rd 2017** 


Well, that was one of the more pleasant surprises. Previously traded as the most likely candidate was March 17th, but now it's coming out two week sooner even. 

However, even this by-and-large positive announcement leaves me with a nagging suspicion: ***Are Nintendo rushing it?*** 

They could have easily aimed at March 31st, no big deal. Almost one full month extra. 

Hmmm... 

---

**299.- Vanilla MSRP** 

Well: bummer. 

My pre-presentation prediction/expectation was $249 -- ***including the SwitchVR viewer.*** 

Okay, so Nintendo are heading for the upper limit there: $299 for the vanilla system, more or less. 

Would not be the least bit surprised about a 3DS-style early price cut. 

---

**Paid Online Services** 

Now, I'm aware a lot of people have asked for this to happen. On the other hand, paid online services have been hurting this console gen big time. 

So this one's highly ambivalent. 

---

**No Region Lock!** 

Well, what's to say about that other than 

*'YIIIIIISSSSS!'* 

One of the very few entirely positive announcements of the show. 

---

**The Battery Life** 

2.5 - 6 hours? 

**2.5??** 

Like, when playing BotW or other more demanding games? 

Ouch... that's pretty rough. Especially for a company that used to make portable game systems that could easily run 10 hours, full gaming.

**HD Rumble** 

So again I have to ask: you include a feature like that... and yet no mention of your VR option? 

.\_. The fungus?

**1 2 Switch** 

Ah, the casual bait. There it is. 

Like the visual design direction though. Too bad the players hardly ever get to look at it.

**Arms**

:sigh: 

HOW IS THIS NOT A SWITCHV.R. GAME?! 

YOU EVEN POINT OUT HOW IT CAN BE PLAYED WITH TWO TABLETS, BUT YOU CAN'T GET AROUND TO STICK THEM IN THAT $15 SWITCHV.R. VIEWER FROM YOUR PATENT?! 

WTF, Nintendo. 

What. The. Fungus. 

Anyway: the visuals look great. 

---

**Splatoon 2** 

Not 'Spla2n'? 

Why? .\_.  

---

**Super Mario Odyssey** 

Pro: Presenter said they're heading for a SM64-style structure, which is good. 

Con: **It looks like a P.C.M.R.-made asset-rip!** Clearly needs artistic (re-)direction. 

The more stylized sequences look fine and fun though. 

---

**Xenoblade Chronicles 2** 

Woah! Did not have that one on the radar. 

As a fan of the first game on the Wii, I should be happy about this, right? 

Two things though: 

1. The good bits look like a Wii remake. Which is okay. But not great. 

2. The character design is flatout terrible. Worst of anime otaku culture. 

---

**FOUR Dragon Quest Titles**

o.o'' 

--- 

**'Skyrim Switch'** 

Hate to admit it, but this one is actually the one game I felt most like having to play it. Looks gorgeous. The only game shown that appears to fully use its potential. 


---

**Breath of the Wild** 

So yes: it IS a launch title, confirmed! 

Phew. 

But then... the more character work they reveal from the game, the more it seems to lapse back to that dreadful Skyward Sword cheese... a stark contrast to the supposed 'return to the franchises dead-pan, Souls-ish roots'. Not convincing. 

---

So yeah... very much a mixed bag. Has not managed to retain the hype of the reveal trailer.

26,"Fuck your stupid fucking fad diet.  Fuck off with your juice cleanse.  Starving yourself does not make you healthier.  

Enjoying the small pleasures of the world is a key ingredient to a happy life.  You are not going to fuck anything up by having a cookie once in awhile.  If you add a creamer to your coffee, you aren't going to hell.  YOU'RE GETTING ON WITH YOUR DAY.  

Restrictive diets are complete bullshit.  Is a trending hashtag enough to make you submit to needless hardship?  Is that all it took to convince you?  Why do things the easy and enjoyable way when you could suffer needlessly instead?  

Only vulnerable people fall for fad diets, and the people who come up with these schemes know it.  You're desperate for someone, anyone, to tell you ANYTHING as long as it might make you better somehow.  They know that if they say, ""I know what to do.  Read my book and you can know too."" thousands of people will line up, money in hand.  Show me a single fad diet with anything other than anecdotal testimonials to back it up and I'll eat a fucking bucket of ghee.  

The answers you're looking for aren't going to come from cutting dairy out of your diet.  Your world is not going to change because you started eating your turkey burgers without a bun.  You ordered turkey instead of beef already -- but that's not good enough for some faceless nobody on instagram, and you just HAVE to please them.  

I understand that you have problems and challenges you face.  Yours may be worse than every one else you know, but they still have their own problems too.  Every. Single. Person.  These people you see around you, getting on with their lives?  It's not because they figured out all the solutions -- it's because they stopped worrying so much about it.  Get comfortable with the idea that you won't always have the answers to all the trials you face in life.  Sometimes things just happen, and you need to take in stride.  Don't feed the problem with more attention than it deserves.  Sometimes what's needed is to change the question instead of seeking an answer.  

Maybe you gained 10 pounds this month.  Fine, eat a little less and exercise a little more and see how it goes next month.  Or better yet, stop weighing yourself and go by how you feel physically instead of what that number says.  Maybe you're feeling lethargic.  Stop answering your work email at home after 8 PM and force yourself to go to bed a little earlier so you can get more sleep.  Lots of zits?  Sometimes breakouts just happen, it's a crap shoot.  It'll probably go away on its own in a few days.  Focus your energy on enjoying your life and the people around you instead.

34,"These come in all shapes and sizes.

I got a call recently saying I won a grant of 5,200 dollars. They wanted me to pay for FedEx shipping of some documents, about 3 dollars and some change, and knew that I was a visa card holder, as well as some other personal info.

I made excuses for them to call back, just in case it was legit....I discovered it's not, and when they called back, I talked for a little and then said ""Thanks, we've talked long enough forme to trace your location, and me and a couple buddies will be there shortly to put a bullet in each one of your scammers heads""

Immediate hang up.

**General rules of thumb:**

If you qualify for a grant, they will NEVER ask you to pay anything in any way, shape, or form. You do not put money out for a grant, that's not how it works.

Not to be racist, but it's a fact: if they sound indian/foreign, chances are, it's a scam.

They choose their words carefully.....manipulation at a decent level. Pay attention and use your critical thinking when speaking to someone like this over the phone, they can make things seem extremely legitimate.

If they make you go through a process, and require you to do anything extra, it's most likely a scam.

Anyone else care to add some to this list?

If you do get a call, urge them to call back, or not call again, as you go and try to verify if it's true or not. I've never had to pay for my grant, mine was delivered to me in the mail with an acceptance letter or something.",13Jan2017,2
36,"Admittedly I'm a young adult and not quite mature in emotions.

Due to how I grew up, I don't think I'll ever have the proper ability to process and handle emotions like a ""normal"" person. So my moods go in phases, and I've kept track of them based on points in my life and when my relationships start. I don't change on purpose, it just happens.

I typically fall in love in Spring, am very happy during the summer, focused in the Fall, and then during the winter... I lose all hope of everything.

When I was younger, I used to help alleviate my winter depression with self-mutilation or other assets of destructive behavior. 

I realize things run much deeper than that, and I do need help. I've been to therapy, and that helps a bunch. 

But this year, this time, I'm the opposite of depressed. Elated. This feels so strange. So amazing. Tranquil! 

Last night I realized it and started to get a little teary-eyed because I cannot believe I'm not in the worse pits of despair. 

There are many things that lead up to this. 

I'm a serial-monogamist, and have been since the 6th grade. I'd find someone that needed emotional help, the outcast, the weird guy, and I'd latch on to him. But of course, it is *never* okay to date someone who is unhappy and shifts the blame on others. Because almost all of my relationships were stressful and depressive. 

Right now, I'm in a healthy relationship with an adult that has graduated college and has a fulltime job. He doesn't have any emotional needs, he doesn't have a dependency on me. I feel free to express *my* emotions to him and he responds positively and lovingly. 

My relationship with my mother is rocky, but as I get older, I'm learning to properly express my feelings with her and easily forgive and forget and talk things out. Use my words.

I'm letting go of all the things and people that hurt me continuously. I'm realizing that some things just aren't meant to be, and I'm learning to control how I deal with that. I *can't* change people. I can't change how people feel about me. I cannot force love onto people that don't want it.

I seriously can't believe it. This is what it feels like. 

Every day I almost expect a tragedy, because I've never felt this *okay* during the Winter in a long, long time. 

This is what it feels like!!!!

39,"I mean, my boyfriend IS my best friend, of course, but I wish I had a best girl friend.

I had a kind of close friend from my previous job but she's younger and thriving, and I figure would much rather hang out with girls her age and her boyfriend.

It's so hard for me to find someone I can get along with. I take things too personally and I overthink a lot of things. I'm not girly enough, no one listens to the same music as me or likes the same movies (boyfriend included). I'm a temp at my current job in a office full of men. There are other women in the building but we don't talk. I see them walk by our office every day.

I used to have a best friend but things got weird. She lived right down the road from us in the city and didn't tell me the entire time until she needed a place to stay for the night. Of course I picked her up, she was my best friend. But the next day when I dropped her off and realized how close she was to me, I was a little hurt that she never bothered to hit me up. Knowing I lived so close. Also, she's close friends with my ex's girlfriend so that makes it weird. I felt like I couldn't trust her. She was the type who's everyone's friend, everyone wanted to be around her. She's so nice and smart, and funny. I'm negative, annoyed and angry. We'd been best friends since 5th grade.

That's another thing, I can't trust anybody. I always think a comment or look on someone's face is them being snarky towards me. I know when and how this started but I didn't realize how bad it was until my brother pointed it out. He said I have social issues, anxiety or something. I try really hard to not think or feel that way, be open-minded. But it makes it even more difficult when people actually ARE being assholes and I'm telling myself it's all in my head.

I have my issues, but it's not one of them. I think it's ok to not talk to most people, if that makes one happy, even if those people did no hurt to you. I may be an ass for ghosting, it's ok to think that, but I do what I do. I myself choose my life's population.",13Jan2017,1
42,"I don’t mean that in a “I’m going to kill myself” way.  I have zero desire to self-harm.  Unless you think eating what I want when I want and drinking too much booze is self-harm.  Then, yeah, I’m doing that.  No, I mean that I’m tired of what my life has turned into and I don’t really have any choices left.

But, first, let me tell you who I am.  
I turned 50 years old this year.  
I am the eldest of 5 kids and all of us come from 4 different dads.  My father, after my brother was born, died.  My mom went nuts and we ended up being dirt poor nomadic white trash.  She went from fucked up husband to fucked up husband and her way of dealing with problems was to move.  

Needless to say I was left on my own for most of my childhood and really didn’t get any lessons or guidance unless it came from my grandparents; but that was too few and too far between.  So I didn’t see that much as my mom found them judgmental because they’d complain about the lifestyle she chose.

I had my very first girlfriend at 19.  She was a divorcee with 3 kids and fucked my brains out like she was trying to win porn queen of the year.  But I wasn’t willing to give up school to just get a job and take care of her so she left me.  I found out because when I called after I got settled into school a guy answered and told me she couldn’t talk because she was busy sucking his dick.

I had no girlfriend until I met my wife.  I met her and we got married when I was 29.  I quit my job and moved to live in the town she was in.  She was divorced with 2 kids and a couple of years younger than me.  Turns out, she was divorced from someone that was mentally, emotionally and physical abusive.  I had never dealt with a sociopath before until I met him.  Holy fuck.  He did a number on her and those two kids.  

I wasn’t really prepared to handle the shitstorm I got myself into and figured it out as best I could.  The kids were damaged and I tried to just be the dad that wished I had.  My wife got pregnant and gave birth to my biological son.  Not long after that the dad for my two step kids signed them away and I adopted them.  He was tired of having his paychecks garnished for child support and being forced to pay for “bullshit” like health insurance for the kids.  So he gave them up and I loved them and was ready to make sure they were taken care of.

Then when my daughter became a teenager all hell broke loose.  The only self-worth she felt she had was when someone bought her something.  She started stealing to get what she wanted and ended up stealing from everyone we knew, every job she got.  Until she found drugs thanks to a guy in high school.  She dropped out and became a drug addict.

My oldest son just didn’t do anything.  Nothing.  The only reason he graduated high school was because his mom did all his senior work.  The only reason he stopped living at home at age 25 is because we had to move to another state for a new job and I told him he wasn’t coming.  He’s still borderline homeless and is only 1 step away from not having a place to live if the people putting him up are tired of him.  

Things get a bit complicated.  When my bio son was 3 I got the most awesome job.  9 years later, when my daughter was a high school drop out drug addict, I got laid off.  It took two months to find another job, which paid less, and then my 1st grandchild was born.  My grandson was born addicted to drugs.  We didn’t know it at the time, we were in denial, but he was.  We tried everything but at 15 months we just took him and didn’t give him back.  We took pictures of the studio apartment she, the baby-daddy and the baby lived in.  She called the cops we showed them the pictures the called CPS and we kept him.

Then began our saga with Social Services.  We had to take parenting classes, get licensed to be foster parents, have countless home inspections, go through background checks.  My daughter got pregnant, my wife wasn’t handling the new baby very well.  He never slept unless he was being held.  And then he’d just scream as if touching him were painful.  I came home as much as I could to help her and take care of my family as my wife was slipping into a deep depression.  Then the 2nd baby was born, the state took him away.  I was there every day rocking him while he went through withdrawals.  She admitted to trying to kill him by taking drugs.  So much that he had a stroke while in the uterus.  The state gave him to us and we took him home.

Then we got a new social worker.  She made us do it all over again.  She’d do surprise home visits and after one time when we weren’t there she told us that “she can just have the kids moved to any foster home she feels is a suitable place for him”.  So we applied for and adopted them.  When we started the adoption track we got another social worker that was supportive and helpful.  The judge took away the parental rights of my daughter and the baby-daddy; which was easy as they never showed up to court.

Then we tried to make things work.  But my new job didn’t pay as much as my last job and we were selling off my retirement to make sure we could pay for what we needed and make the mortgage payments.  The kids had problems and needed support and we paid a lot out of pocket for it.

Then I got laid off from that job in 2014.  I actually had to train my replacement that was from India on an H1B visa and brought there **just to take my job**.  The company made me sign a gag order or forfeit my huge severance.  I was out of work for 6 months trying to find a new job.  Money was getting bad but I found a job, 5 states away.  The good news is it paid the same I had been making.  The bad news I had to move myself.

So I leveraged my already heavily leveraged ass and move my family across country to what was supposed to be my last job ever and our new life.  Then, 9 months later, the company outsourced all it’s IT work and I was out of a job.  Again.  There I was, out of work, in a new state, and out of money, and heavily in debt with two special needs kids and my own bio son that was now 17 years old.

I did find a job, paying me less than the last job.  I had to file for bankruptcy.  So all I have now are student loans that I can’t pay (I used them to get my MBA to try and make a better career for myself and my wife tried school so she could work but the nature of the kid’s needs means she has to be there for them – and now we can’t pay them back).

Here I am.  My bio son is 19.  My daughter is now clean and with a decent guy and has a new baby.  My oldest son is still marginally employed and housed but he’s on the edge.  The kids are 7 and 6 (they’re 18 months apart).  They have behavior problems.  The youngest has mental and learning issues due to the stroke.  My bio son is 19 and trying to make his own life.

And then, just last August, we lost everything in a flood.  We had no flood insurance (we were renters and not in a flood plain so didn’t even think of getting it).  

My wife now is in a deep depression.  Everyone in my family has PTSD as we had to be rescued from our house by boat.  Then rescued from the place they took us by boat.  And then rescued from that place by a national guard dump truck.  We were homeless sleeping in a parking lot for 2 months until I got us a house.  Kids now have beds, wife and I are still on the floor.  

Fuck I am tired.  The kids still don’t sleep through the night.  I haven’t had a good night’s sleep in 7 years.  I’m now a fat guy.  I never thought I’d be a fat guy.  But here I am.  I worked my way through college moving furniture.  I used to be ripped.  Not now.  Not the weight has just crawled onto me in the 20 years of my marriage.  It started when the stresses with our daughter started.  

I love my family.  I love my wife (we’ve been married 20 years now).  I love my kids.  Cuddling while we watch cartoons before bedtime is one of my favorite things to do with my kids.  But I am fucking exhausted and I now spend my commute time daydreaming about being single with no kids.  About being able to actually afford to go out to lunch with the guys at work instead of bringing left overs from home.

I have no end in sight.  It’s not like I’ll leave my family.  I love them and I am their sole support.  They need me.  It not like I can go “get a break”.  We’re broke.  We’re barely staying housed right now.  And my wife needs help with the kids.  They “burn up” her limit and I have to take over and let her have a break.

On the day it was supposed to arrive to my house, I see a notification on my Amazon page. ""ATTEMPTED DELIVERY, PERSON DID NOT RESPOND TO DOOR""  I thought, shit,  maybe I didnt hear the door. I called UPS seeing if there was any way I can either pick it up myself or the driver can come back. They told me to pick it up.

I went to their hub and waited around 45 minutes only to be told since the address did not match my license (I had recently moved) I needed a power bill. Ok I was a bit upset, but I still said okay and asked them if they could still ship it to my house. They say OK.

Great! So it's the next day and I'm off of work so that leaves me with the whole day to wait for this package. I have a little sofa right by door which is where I spent the whole fucking day and I heard no knocks the whole day.
