0,I wish I had some sort of guidance when I was younger. I ended up wasting a year failing at a major that I never even liked. the only positive thing from the time there is that I discovered what I truly do enjoy learning about. Now I'm failing my classes in community college. Everything just seems so mundane to me like I'm wasting my time here. I started thinking that I should just reset everything and move to NYC and take classes there like I wanted to in high school. Meanwhile I've been lying to both my parents and girlfriend about my classes. I love my girlfriend a lot and I've made her worry about me and school before as well. This isnt the first time I've lied about my grades to her. The first time created such a huge mess and I never want to cause that again. But I ended up slipping back into old habits anyway. And I worry when I eventually have to tell her she'll end up leaving me for good. I've talked to people about their own experiences it always makes me hopeful but I can't get this sensation that nothing will be the same after i make that first step and it scares me.,07Dec2017,1
1,"I just need to get this out there. I feel so out of place at my college since I don't have any social media at all. I hate constantly going having to go on facebook or Snapchat and see how much better everyone is than me at everything and I hate feeling like I was constantly being watched and judged by everyone who could see my profiles online. The only app I still use is reddit and only because its anonymous and no one knows my account name.

Last year I got fed up and deleted all of my social media accounts (except for facebook but I havent been on it since a year ago and I don't even know if they keep accounts open after theyve been neglected for that long). Now that ive moved to a new city the loneliness has set in and I have no way to reach out and make new friends. Everyone organizes events on social media and no one wants to go to the extra effort to text me about stuff. 

I feel so inferior for having this fear and I wish I couls just be a normal person with a normal social network online and in real life but instead I'm all alone with nothing and no one. Even if I sacked up and redownloaded all the apps I would be starting from nothing and anyone I tried to connect would see that I have zero friends/followers. I don't think I could handle that embarrassment. 

My social life is a garbage fire and at the only comfort I have is that I can isolate myself from the world and be invisible online so no one can see how much of a loser I really am.",07Dec2017,2
2,"I had a passion since I was 14 years old, I am now 23. I was very enthusiastic about photography and started doing it as a hobby with not so new camera. I used to travel to see places, I used to walk around and enjoy the moment, I used to look at the things around me and be grateful for what I see up until I got obsessed with photography. 

I live in a small town in northern UK, I am from Eastern Europe, but also lived in the states when I found my passion when I bought my first camera. It all started with taking any photos and enjoying it in AUTO MODE up until I started learning about the functionalities and tactics on how to get the perfect shot, but with that, it comes editing and I no longer use apps on my phone to easily edit a photo for 40 seconds and share it on my Instagram (at the time, with no more than 500 people). I started editing on Adobe Lightroom and photoshop, and since then, I am anxious, stressed and depressed if I don’t get the right shot.

Even when I am out without my camera, I am thinking: “oh this would be an amazing picture if I had my camera with me and shoot it from this angle”, or “this is amazing weather for some shooting”. I then take my camera and can’t enjoy the moment, instead I am worried about apertures, light and exposure. I can no longer enjoy my life and I became a very depressed person. 

When I add my Instagram profile that grew from 500 followers to 10500 I am now pressured to produce good content for people I don’t really know and it’s killing me inside. People tell me - you are talented and should focus on photography, but I am so fed up with it and at the same time I like it sometimes to take a good photo but it’s absolutely taking me away from reality and life as a whole. At the same time I have this huge platform to showcase my work and get it featured all around that some people are working so hard for. 

My meetings changed from “let’s have a coffee in the garden” to “let’s shoot around and exhaust ourselves”

I need to stop, but I don’t want to take my hobby away and I definitely need to get disciplined and start enjoying the things around me.",07Dec2017,1
3,"A couple months back, my older sister and I went to a party. Someone brought booze and we ended up getting drunker than we planned on. Long story short, during the drive home my sister lost control of the car and hit a tree.

I was okay, but my sister broke her nose on the steering wheel. Before we knew it, we heard sirens and realized that someone must've seen the crash and called 911. I felt so bad for my sister. She'd just turned 18 and would be charged as an adult. I figured she didn't need that on top of her nose being broken and her car being wrecked. So I told her to let me take the blame since I'd be charged as a minor.  She agreed and I was the one arrested that night.

Fast forward to this week. I was in court this afternoon. I pled guilty to DWI and vehicular assault (on account of her nose) and was sentenced to spend all of Christmas break (17 days) in juvenile detention. I report to start serving my sentence on the evening of the 21st and won't get out until the evening of January 7th. 

I know we shouldn't have been drinking that night and the decision to drive ourselves home was a really stupid one. My sister and I both caught hell from mom and dad, of course. I've lost my license. And my boyfriend dumped me because his dad found out about all this and forbid him from seeing me anymore.

I guess what I want to know is...did I do the right thing by taking the blame? I mean, my juvenile record will be sealed eventually whereas her record would've been permanent. Plus, she wouldn't have even gone to that party if I hadn't wanted to. And she only drank because I told her to loosen up for once. So, I feel like I'm more to blame. I'm certainly not innocent at any rate.

Also, I've never been in trouble with the law before and never been to a place like juvie before. Can anyone tell me what I'm in for and any advice on how to make the 17 days go by smoothly?

Finally, I just want to say I'm sorry we ever drank and I hope whoever's reading this will learn from our mistakes.",07Dec2017,7
4,"I understand that life can get stressful, sad or even depressing sometimes.

However we forget what life is really all about.

Do what you love. If you love your family, be with your family. If you love your friends, be with your friends. Drawing a passion? Do it. Writing? Get a pen and paper. I love my family, music, and good food. So I'll be damned if that's what I want to do for my life.

Stay close with your family. Call someone. If your life doesn't revolve around the people you love then you need to make that happen. The people you love are the ones that will give you the true meaning of life. It's what you care about. They will love you the same and then need you too.

8,"I grew up trying not to become another statistic. I had a lot of anger with the world when I was younger. I felt like the world was constantly picking me apart and using me. I didn't want to be another victim. I went to therapy to relieve all the pain of my past. It definitely helped but I don't think it healed me completely.

I got into the world of BDSM. I enjoyed it because I felt like I could release my anger but in a good way. Then somewhere along the line, I stopped doing it because I dated partners who weren't into it. But I would get emotionally abusive with them and say the cruelest things. Or I would purposely cheat on them even though I knew it was wrong.

I remember slapping one of my partners in the face and they didn't like it. They told me to stop and I thought it was funny. I laughed in their face and slapped them again. After all the abuse I would give them, I would ask for forgiveness and they usually gave it because it was unusual. Then after some time, I would do the same thing.

I was talking to someone new today and realized how much I wanted to tear them down. I had spoken to them on the phone last night. They were so soft spoken and nervous. It was like crushing an ant. I stopped myself before saying anything and told them that I wasn't interested anymore.

I just want to be left alone and depressed while I get my shit together, then I am fine socializing again. I want to keep passively losing friends until that point. 

But I get so conflicted. I miss people, I love seeing people happy, I love making people laugh and/or happy, I love getting through tough challenges with people. 

I just love humans and so many of my friends so much, but for the past while, I've been conflicted and I guess I am looking for social feedback from people that do not know me.",07Dec2017,1
11,"I lost my best friend of 8 years tonight. Because of something I posted on Twitter out of anger because I feel like she has a new best friend. I never deleted the tweet because it got buried so far down in my feed and I never thought about it. She found it and has basically told me to go fuck myself and said she’s glad she saw my true colors and that I never cared about her which isn’t true. I’ve cared about her for all the 8 years we’ve been best friends. My heart is hurting. It took her 2.5 seconds to block me off everything. Facebook, Instagram, snapchat, even my number. I feel like she was glad to be rid of me if she blocked me that fucking quick. Her parents or her new best friend hasn’t blocked me yet though. I didn’t even get a chance to explain myself. I don’t want you readers to think I’m one of those people who don’t want their closest friends to have other friends. I want my friends to have a large friend group because I don’t have that. But if I feel like it’s something I did I’ll immediately fall into a nervous wreck wondering what I did. I wondered the whole month why she was drifting away from me.

If you know me, you probably see me as an uplifting, happy-go-lucky idiot who doesn't have a care in the world. That image couldn't be further from the truth. Here's my current biography: 26, no degree, just lost my job as a sales worker (what the fuck, right?), moved back with parent, and now I'm stuck at home doing freelancing work that pays in straws.

The funny thing is, I *know* what I'm suppose to do to get out of it. I should either go back to school, or pick up a few certs that interest me. The problem is that I'm completely devoid of self-motivation when I'm pursing anything alone. I just need someone - anyone - to work next to me. It doesn't even have to be anything related to my studies, just being generally productive is enough. Is that weird? Because I sure as fuck think it is.

Due to my recent termination, I get almost no chance to meet with new people. Connecting and learning from others has always been an integral part of my life, and now that's gone too.

I've lived like this for two months. Two months without income. Two months of rotting away in my bedroom chair. Two months of having to look at my loving mother in the eye and feel her disappointment. Our conversations have been reduced to simple formalities. I feel I've turned the house into her personal prison, with no end to her sentence.

21,"  Was felling asleep and suddenly my heart was racing. I told myself to relax but still felt something was off. I felt all tingly all over and got up. I bit my shoulder to kind of relax. That didn't help. So I walked around the room. I felt dizzy then my ears started to ring. I rushed back go the bed to lay down before I pass out.  Called a family member. Helps me to calm down.

Feel better buy I gotta be up in a couple of hrs.

 Not the first time. Has it once then it lingered for a week because I had no idea what it was. Doc told me it was anxiety.

Got blood test and came back normal.

Recently Ive been feeling it lore often but now it feels more physical. I feel like I got something in my chest. Or esophagus. I usually go the gym after work atleast 3 times a week. For two hrs.

 This time I felt more tired and felt like I had a harder time breathing. That ""thing"" in my chest feels like something inside is choking me. And its tough to swallow and when I take deep breaths, sometimes I cant take it all the way in. I end up coughing. Its causing me to develop a cough. Haven't been eating as much because of it. 
Its like having phlegm that I cant cough up. I feel it more in my chest just under my collar bone. 
 
Feels almost like pneumonia. Hurts sometimes too. I did go to the doc last week for what I was feeling but they just tell me it's anxiety. 


Lost some weight aswell. But I been going to the gym so that might be it. Two hrs a session. Three times a week. Weights then cardio. 

 Lately been waking up with what feels like swollen glands. On my collar bone, shoulder, under the corner of my jaw and back of neck. Even hard lumps on my lower back which made it more harder to workout. Those lumps I felt for years. Feels like I have the flu with occasional chills.

Over the years, I've had treatment for some of my more visceral symptoms of PTSD- the hyper-vigilance, the nightmares, the taking cover when there's a loud bang, the inability to be near a fireworks show, the fear and anxiety produced while driving... but in my latest round of treatment I've finally reached a point where I can say aloud: I regret it all. 

What i did in Iraq, on a daily basis, was wrong. We terrorized innocent people as part of an ill-gotten and illegal war. Kicking in doors, tearing apart the homes of innocent families during random house searches, stopping people on the streets..

The guilt of being an occupier, an oppressor, is eating me from the inside out. I sit in my home and imagine myself and my squad, coming storming into my living room and what that would do to me, my wife, and my children.

Well for once I wish I could be 100% up front and honest. I wanna say how I really am and what I really want. So here goes.

Looks are a good 80-90% of things here. My future boyfriend needs to look good. No exceptions. I'm not that picky but there's certain facial features I like and don't like. I'm not gonna be attracted to most guys, just deal with that. If you're unattractive but still get me to date you (somehow), expect me to not want to even look at you, and to constantly look at other guys.

I'm extremely sensitive, so expect me to get upset a lot over people on the internet bullying me. Expect me to cry and wanna self-harm from it and make threats against people and have the police show up (yes this actually happens). Be ready to cuddle me for hours when I'm crying and upset, which will likely happen on a daily basis. 

Due to rampant SJWism, I don't feel safe around minorities. Don't be an SJW and be ready to spend all your time caring about *me* and paying attention to *me and only me*. You can have some straight friends but that's it. Don't waste time pandering to minorities who are just mean to nerdy white cismen like us anyway (cuz anyone I date is gonna be a nerdy white cisman, no apologies about it).

Don't be too faggy or stereotypically gay. Just don't. In fact, I prefer you be bisexual or pansexual since I can't stand fully gay men. They're full of personality flaws and most just aren't attractive to me anyway. Only full-gay I can tolerate (and only sometimes) is myself. And don't be too pervy or slutty either, that's gross.

I'm autistic and need things done a specific way or I will literally REEEEEEE. If I tell you to stop doing something, you better stop. I'm actually quite low maintenance, just most people don't have the basic decency to listen to me. 

I've been bullied, abused, neglected, rejected, and taken advantage of my whole life. I get extremely jealous when seeing couples (especially gay ones) or even just groups of friends. I will try to self-harm if I see pics or videos of them (trying to watch porn is quite an experience, I wanna fap and cry at the same time). I need someone who will give me all of the love I never got. Give me all the attention I've been craving (which is a lot, but it's easy). Don't pay attention to anyone else. It'll be just us helping each other, nobody else. Love me unconditionally. 

Don't be smarter than me and don't be too talented. I'll get petty and jealous. Be on my level, not above it (except looks wise, I want a cute guy). I prefer you not have a good job or career, don't go to college, don't have a social life, and if you work, not too much because I need you to spend time with me, not be busy.

32,"Tl;dr: She said we should let things playout like some kind of survival show with no limitations on what is fair for the consumers. 

I sent my rep an email about net neutrality and why, in my opinion, it should be left in place. and what do I get in response? This:

&gt;Thank you for contacting me with regard to net neutrality. I appreciate your taking the time to inform me of your thoughts on this important issue.
As you may know, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the Obama administration imposed rules that would regulate internet service providers (ISPs) like public utilities and require them to treat all traffic, content, and applications equally. I am concerned that this regulation, by forcing ISPs to provide equal access to high-bandwidth sites and content regardless of the impact on network infrastructure, harms their ability to innovate and continue improving broadband access across the country.
The internet has largely been unregulated since its inception, but the Obama administration was quick to use the heavy hand of government to control it under the guise of fairness. The growth of the internet demonstrates how innovation and our economy can flourish when the government gets out of the way.
On November 21, 2017, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced the FCC will vote in December on a plan to begin rolling back these heavy regulations on ISPs. I am confident the FCC will return to a less burdensome regulatory framework that for decades allowed internet technology to thrive and grow. I will be sure to keep your thoughts in mind when discussing net neutrality and ways to keep the internet open and innovative with my colleagues.

37,"Don't know where to start to be honest, but ill give it a shot. This post is mainly going to be about how I feel I am developing as an individual, as well as all of my inadequacies and the problems I am facing.

So I've always been quite a shy person (partly due to me being me, but also my somewhat sheltered upbringing) and started to realise around the age of 18 that being shy can be a hindrance in social settings. I'd always wanted to change but never really knew how to. I lacked identity, purpose, pretty much just following the path that was laid out for me. Fast forward to 19, I start university. I thought that university would be the beginning of a new exciting life. Turned out to be utter shit. I had no identity and was extremely insecure, alongside having a lack of experience for life outside my home. It led to me drinking way too much and the expectation of fun experiences being handed to me on a silver platter. It led me to a depression where I pretty much isolated myself for about 3 months.

That's when I decided to change.

I started working out again, started to listen to Jordan B Peterson (check him out if you haven't heard of him) hell, I even started no fap just to see some change. I started to face my fears, started trying to talk to and meet new people. I changed my ideology, not that I was possessed by a specific one, it's just my train of thought was just pathological and neurotic and self-loathing, so I had to change it into a more goal orientated and conscious mind. 

Because of the course I study and recent advents in my personal life as well, I started to really think about my mortality as well. I started to realise that I’m not going to be here for a long time and that one of the things I truly desire is to die a satisfied man.

I started to grow some teeth. Not that I had become more confrontational, but I became more willing to use the negative aspects of myself, or the aspect of myself I didn’t like in order to get what I wanted. So, for example lying when it was most suitable for me and social setting (not proud of it tbh).

I guess this lead to me becoming socially strategic. Any time I went out, it was to better myself and my social standing. I became a bit more of a yes man I guess you could say. I started trying to integrate more with the group and create a much more fun and relatable persona, because one thing I realised, is that if you don’t contribute to the group in some way, people will see you as useless. 

Because of these changes, I’ve become so much better socially. I have different groups of friends (still not as tight as I would like it to be, but I’m working on it) and I’m also having waaaaaaaaaaaaay more success with girls as well.
So that brings me to what’s going on now. I don’t know whether it’s over indulging in my urges for instant gratification, but recently I just feel demotivated. I don’t feel like doing much to be honest. I just want to eat junk food most of the time and ready funny stuff on reddit.

What really lead me to make this post however, was today when I was in class. I had a piece of group work to present to my class, and tbh I have been pretty relaxed with this work, whilst all of my other peers have been pretty stressed out. Part of our mark is a peer mark meaning; my peers grade the amount of effort I put into the work. What really shook me was not the idea that my peers would give me bad mark, it was the fact that I knew I didn’t put in all the effort I could have. It’s literally been like this for the past couple of years now, while being at college and university. I sort of coast along. 

I’m always distracted by life itself. Just trying to figure the best way to be, the most truthful and straightforward way. Trying to reduce the amount of suffering I endure. Doing all of these thing within my mind, I think this may have lead to my being more drawn towards watching how things are done rather in part taking in what I should be doing. To put it metaphorically, I’m more orientated towards observing the game of life rather than playing it. 

I really realised this with one of my peers that was peer marking me. I realised that he is pretty much the opposite off me. He plays the game of life rather than observe it. He does a really good job at playing the game as well. He’s really driven, goal orientated and capable of good leadership. One of the things I see from him, is how he strategises everything he does whilst playing by the rules. He doesn’t have to break the rules. He seems to have a really strong moral compass and he just speaks and is lead by the truth. So I know I got a bad mark from him, but I respect that. This is something I want to be able to do, or become like.

How do I become a better player, or at least more balanced and focused? 

Could you guys give me some advice on being more serious and being perceived as more serious as well? I’ve been having a lot of issues with this. I think it stems from me trying to avoid responsibility and therefore I think I try to create the image that I’m void off all responsibilities and or that i shrug off and avoid all responsibility, which leads to people not taking me seriously, and them seeing me as a class clown or a mess in general (which is easy to understand, I am a bit of a mess).

Thanks guys

39,"I have hated Christmas for about ten years now.  When I was younger, my parents told me that I would get my Christmas spirit back when I had kids.  I'm 36, and single, and that's not likely going to happen at all.  It's only this time of year that I am lonely.  The other 11 months, the other days, I don't care and I don't notice that I am single. 

Last winter I learned of a program that one of the bigger retail drugstores does, called Stocking for Seniors.  Senior citizens fill out a small card listing the items they would like for Christmas. I just started a new job and couldn't participate towards the cause last year, but promised myself that I would if I had the income this year.  And I do.  

I Went to the drugstore today and picked a card for a fellow named Daniel.  He asked for puzzles, magazines, a blanket and gloves and a toque.  I went around the store and grabbed the items requested and handed the items to someone at customer service.  She commented, ""That's so kind!"" 

When I left the store I felt good, but I had an overwhelming urge to cry. Even writing this is making me tear up.  

I think about these people who don't have family and likely wouldn't get anything for Christmas if it were not for this program and it breaks my heart.  I thought I would be happy for doing something nice, but I am so sad.  

I'm not drawing parallels between myself and these people - despite being single, I have family and friends.  I'm not alone.  Why am I so sad?
