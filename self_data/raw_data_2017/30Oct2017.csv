4,"So what if a Disney show has a gay character? The kid was obviously gay. I even said to my daughter during an episode last season “Oh, I thought he was gay” when he first started “dating” this girl. You’re just so pissed that gay people exist that you don’t want anyone to acknowledge they exist. The point of this show is to shine a light on real situations that kids go through. It is one of her favorite shows on tv right now and I swear to everything that if you ruin it for her by making her hate a character you will never see your granddaughter again. You talk all the time about how Muslims want to bring sharia law to the states but what you don’t see is that you are too. You use your religion to justify hate and want everyone to share your views. Fuck you dad. ",30Oct2017,47

8,"I broke up with my girlfriend of almost two years a little over two months ago. I definitely didn't handle it well at first, even though I knew it was for the best. Now, not only do I know it's for the best, I also feel a hell of a lot happier than I did when we were together. My drive to better myself has gone up and I'm gaining a lot of confidence. 

Only problem is, when my busy life slows down and I have time to just sit, I start to think about her. It's this strange inner bitter-sweetness of wishing we could have worked things out and been happy, but at the same time knowing that at this point in our lives, we weren't right for each other.  I harbor a lot of resentment towards her for many of her actions, but at the same time I fight with missing her. I obviously wouldn't even consider getting back with her(and neither would she, for that matter), but damn I wish I could just hit the crest of complete acceptance and stop thinking about her so much.

11,"My mom and I are having a lot of issues and our relationship is unhealthy. I just want to fix it, by doing the right thing.

Her boyfriend lives overseas. We live in the US. They're in a serious long distance relationship. He suggested that she come and spend Christmas with him and his kids (between ages of 18-22). 

I'm an adult so technically my mom doesn't owe me shit &amp; I need to move out anyway (which I will, next year im off to school), but Christmas I thought was supposed to be about family. 

Can't help but think it's my fault and because of our unhealthy relationship she doesn't want to be around me or my siblings. More so me. It's a long story but basically her boyfriend thinks she didn't raise us right. I'm in a bad place right now but my siblings aren't. My mom still thinks that she should've raised all of us differently despite my siblings not being fuck ups like myself. She was raised by a strict mother and her boyfriend thinks that we don't do enough for her. I'm not saying it's my fault for a fact but my siblings feel the same way (that she is sort of running away from us). One of my siblings actually suggested this before I realized that I felt the same but on a more personal level. 

My mom missed thanksgiving last year to spend it with him. So it was just me and my siblings for thanksgiving. It was kind of shitty tbh. Now she's missing Christmas. She told me to think about it and tell her what I honestly think but I don't want to be honest because I'd just say something selfish like don't go, but I want her to be happy. It just makes me sad that she wants to go. And I'm pissed off that her boyfriend suggested for her to miss Christmas with us. I doubt he'd miss Christmas with his kids but I don't know for sure. 

We aren't little kids anymore, we're adults but it just feels wrong you know? Am I wrong for feeling this way? Felt really really shitty after she told me and hours after we spoke she even mentioned that I was mentally gone hours and asked me if I was alright. I wasn't but I didn't mention it. Or maybe I'm just a selfish asshole?

**TL;DR** Mom wants to spend Christmas with her boyfriend and his adult kids. Me and my siblings are also her adult kids but I still feel shitty about it.

17,"Hey all,

Please let me know if there's a better subreddit for this! This seemed like a good place to start the discussion.

So... let's start with a bit of story-time. Ever since childhood, all the way until my late teens, I found it VERY easy to just... THINK, you know? Sit down, look back, reflect on the day.... heck, as a teen, there were times in the day where I would literally just lie down in the bat (long baths/showers FTW!), and not do anything besides just THINK about.... anything! Think about the day, about myself, about love, about what it'd be like if I had super-powers, about the future, about... anything! I guess you could lump ""creativity"" into this too, as there'd be many times where I would come up with random things worth investigating/spending time on later.

And yet... it seems like all of that went away as soon as I reached adulthood. I don't know if it was literally a side-effect of getting older, or if I just became too busy with work to sit there and be able to ""think"" anymore, but... it feels like I've completely forgotten how to THINK, you know? It feels like my creativity is completely gone these days, and whenever I get any time to myself, I'm not able to sit there and ""think"" as effectively as I could before. The best way for me to describe it is - either I think about whatever's most pertinent to my short-term goals (things like how to effectively deal with whatever's bothering me at work, etc.), and then if I'm able to find a way to stop thinking about those, my brain is... literally, BLANK. As in, I can't think of ANYTHING. My brain shuts down and I can honestly feel like I can't get anything useful to run through my head. It's a weird feeling! Does anyone here know what I mean?

Here's some things I've tried:

* **Meditation** - completely useless. Like I explained above, sure it helps to calm me down and ""clear"" my mind, sure, but then it feels like my mind isn't able to think about the things I WANT to think about - instead I'm sitting there with a completely blank mind.
* **Going to a bar** - besides the fact that I don't really like sitting at a bar by myself (I like to pretend I'm not COMPLETELY an alcoholic), I find that it doesn't really work - while the alcohol helps a bit, I feel like it accentuates all the random sounds in the bar, and I find myself unable to focus on my thoughts. I'm instead focusing on the conversations of other people next to me, or the music playing, etc.
* **Drinking/Drugs by myself** - Similar as above, the drugs help to clear my head, but I find I'm not really able to ""think"" when I do these things... I mostly find myself paying too much attention to the things around me, rather than focusing inwards.

Again, my main question is basically - is ""self-reflection"" and ""creativity"" something that someone loses the ability to do as one gets older? Or is there someway that you do it that helps you, that isn't covered by what I said above? (A lot of people have recommended the meditation/bar/drugs that I mentioned above, and I'm happy it works for them, but it doesn't work for me... I'm curious if there's some of you out there who this doesn't work for, and found something that does.)

At the very least, I hope it sparks some discussion on the topic - I feel like all of us could benefit from a little self-reflection every now and then. Thanks!",30Oct2017,1

If you haven't yet watched this stand up yet, you need to right now. don't read any further, just watch it. It is definitely worth your time

Not only was Patton hilarious, but about half way through the special, he brings up his wife who died a year before the recording.   The Audience isn't laughing for way longer than i'm used to for a stand up special, and he doesn't make any jokes. It was such a personal moment, that is now broadcasted to all of netflix. You get more and more emotional, forgetting its a comedy show, and then as soon as he cracks the next joke, its a different kind of laughter. This laughter isn't your run of the mill laughter from any stand up show, its a release. It's built up tension that is let out, and i think it perfectly puts you in Pattons position, because using humor was his way to eventually cope with the loss of his wife, and i feel like I just went through the same journey as he did. And its even more perfect when you take into account the setting, a comedy show, the last place you expect such a cruel story to be, just like Patton didn't expect to lose his wife so suddenly. The entire set is perfectly orchestrated to put you in a state of comfort, then grief, and eventual acceptance and finally a sense of moving on. 

I coudn't find any discussion over this special on reddit and I'd love to discuss it with all of you. Watch the special, it is definitely worth your time.",30Oct2017,0

23,"You fucked shit up. 

I say that for the first time in my life. I’ve had some four years with an iPhone. It’s my second year with an iPad. Never in that period I’d seen iOS become such a shitfest of bugs. My iPad Pro works like a $100 Chinese Android. Websites in Safari keep refreshing like there was no RAM. Battery life’s non-existent—one charging lasts half the time shorter—I have to charge the device two, three times a day. I can’t update—11.0.3 fails to install repeatedly. Safari takes 1.4 GB, and I can’t clean that up. Apps open with a few seconds of delay. They keep crashing. 

Fuck you, Apple. Fuck you, because I’ve always liked iOS. I trusted you enough to make my iPad my only computer—it used to be so good, and only that keeps me with you—because I know you’re able to make it so good again. ",30Oct2017,6
24,"First off, this actually happened Thursday. I'm alive (obviously) and please forgive the spelling and grammar mistakes as even typing right now is a real effort.

So, after years of breaking up and getting back together, begging for counseling and telling her I was unhappy, I finally broke up for real with my gf of 5 years. We have an apartment and a 3 year old so we were going to finish out our lease and do joint custody.

We made it one day. She has a history of mental illness and last thrusday I came home to grab my computer (I usually work from home but didn't want to be there with her for obvious reasons). Now she had lost her phone and swore up and down that I took it. I asked to be left alone and got my computer loaded up. When I came back in she was starting to break my things. Little stuff like sunglasses and what not. I began to film her. She asked me not to and I said I feel like I needed to film her for my own safety. She went nuts at this point. She hit me in the face with a sturdy metal basket and then grabbed a steak knife and put it to her own skin. She drew a little blood. Now she was done this kind of stuff before and I've always managed to get the knife away from her and get us calmed down. Not this time. Still filming I took a slow step forward and asked her for the knife and she stabbed me in the fucking heart. I was in shock. She was in shock. She threw down the knife and was begging me to call the police. I knew I wasn't far from the hospital so I grabbed some paper towels and pressed it in to the stab wound and drove off. I walked in somewhere on the third floor (i should have just gotten out at the ER but I didn't know what to do with my car and I didn't want it towed). They got me in a wheelchair and a few minutes later my mom was there. They hooked me up to a bunch of IV's and put a catheter in (easily one of the worst parts of all of it. Why couldn't they have done it after I was knocked out). They put me under and it turns out that (according to the surgeon), I had lost 4 liters of blood and my heart was not moving. For reference, the average person has 4.7 - 5.5 liters of blood in their whole body! They cut me open and pulled out a clot from my heart the size of a plum. I woke up a few hours later with a morphine drip and tubes coming out of my chest. I also couldn't breathe on my own and was hooked up to a machine and was doing it for me. I was told I was very lucky to be alive and that if I had been just one minute slower they very likely wouldn't have been able to save me. I'm not dead yet bitches! The knife wound itself is only about 2 inches deep but it pierced a major artery right next to my heart. So one minute slower or if I had been stabbed a half inch the right I would be dead right now!

I'm used to getting up early from my hospital stay and the detectives have my phone (for the video evidence). I'm going to upload some photos of the lung tubes and scars from where they cut into me. I will not be uploading videos of me getting stabbed. I still haven't seen them and frankly I couldn't even watch tv shows where people got stabbed since it happened. Something about it can be traumatic? Either way, I'm alive and I'll have photos in a few hours when my mother wakes up. Also I wanted to let people know that our daughter was at daycare when this happened and she is currently with me. My ex bailed out on only 500 dollars for attempted murder! I never wanted her to go to jail but I think she needs severe mental help. She's not only a danger to herself but to others as well. Thanks for reading! Also one last thing that has surprised me is the tremendous outpouring of support from people here. I live in a little old southern town (pop of maybe 40k) and I have been getting so many kind thoughts and prayers from people. I'm very grateful to be alive right now.

Also, if anyone is wondering, being dead wasn't scary at all. It was like being asleep. I never spoke to any beings or moved toward a light. There was no pain or anything. It was absolutely beautiful and while I'm not quite ready to die, I think that when it does come for me, I won't be as scared of it as I once was. Sure the build up to it was kind of scary, but I didn't think I was anywhere close to death. The last thing I said before I went under was, ""Don't worry mom. I'm not going to die. I'm just going to have a hell of a story to tell.""

TL;DR - got stabbed in the heart. I was dead for a bit but I'm alive again!

Edit: [Pictures!](https://imgur.com/a/OJfBa) I'm sorry that I don't have any of the surgery itself. This was Sunday and just a few minutes before they removed the tubes!

Also, I am NOT going for joint custody anymore. The ex is more than likely going to prison or a mental hospital. I have an emergency hearing today to get full custody. She is obviously nowhere near able to be raising a kid. She almost killed me!",30Oct2017,22
25,"It makes no sense. I'm a boy. I like this girl a lot. But she has a boyfriend from her old town. She's in a long distance relationship for a while but previously before she arrived to my town, it was a full on relationship.

Within 8 months of being a friend to her, she tells me more stuff and shares more of her feelings/thoughts than anyone else, even her bf. 

We haven't met a lot. 8 times max. 

It makes no sense. What's the difference between a boyfriend and a friend? 

Sometimes I get sad about this. Sometimes i want to shoot myself. 

Her bf is her world. Yet she shares more stuff with me.

26,"I realised that I was definitely going to die not long after my 39th birthday, in 2016.  There was a lot of death that year.  Said realisation has almost completely destroyed any capacity for happiness I previously had.  My attitude towards death is one of utterly inconsolable, hysterical panic.  It comes up regularly, but whenever it does now, I can only shove it out of my head and try and tell myself, ***""not today.""***

Death does not care what we think of it.  It is something that we are completely incapable of having any control over.  It is inevitably going to happen, and when it does, there are at least even odds that we will no longer exist in any form at all.

The only reason why I will tell you not to be afraid of it, is because being afraid does not change it.  Nothing we can do does.  You can be completely impassive to it, or you can lie on the ground and scream until you are hoarse, and neither action will make any difference whatsoever.  There is no escape.  There is nothing we can do to get away from it.

You are probably close to half my age.  Most of the people here are.  Sometimes I struggle to avoid misanthropy towards Millennials, and the rest of the time I honestly pity them.  Being Millennial, more than anything else, means not knowing just how truly and unavoidably ***fucked*** you really are.  Being Millennial means not valuing freedom or the ability to make your own choices, because you've never had that and you don't know what it looks or feels like.  Being Millennial means being utterly dependent on groups and group identification, more than any other generation in known history, and believing that you are literally not spiritually or ethically permitted to be alone.

The only advice I can give you is, ***don't end up like me.*** My definition of a good day is one where I don't start crying as soon as I open my eyes and remember where I am.

Apart from anything else, never let yourself be dominated by anyone.  Never be willing to pointlessly suffer for the sake of someone else, when said people are truthfully just psychopathic leeches who would be doing exactly the same thing to someone else if you were not around.  The only thing you have is time, and this planet is populated far too heavily by individuals who will tear your heart out and eat it over the space of years, all the while telling both themselves and you that the only thing they want is to help you.

Welcome to the Age of Aquarius.  Welcome to the period in which we sell our children and our organs to each other, because unlike any other time, in this one, love and everything else that was once considered worth preserving, is now viewed exclusively as a means of obtaining money.  Whoever dies with the most numbers on a computer screen, wins.

If you're lucky, you'll get seventy years of that, and then it's lights out.

41,"So Trump's former campaign manager (serving from June to August 2016), Paul Manafort has been federally indicted.


From what I understand, he laundered $18,000,000 in the past 10 years for an unnamed company (presumably the Podesta Group) and Tony Podesta just now stepped down from said Group amid the Mueller probe.

Manafort is charged with 12 counts: conspiracy against the USA, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false/misleading FARA statements, false statements to federal investigators, and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign banks/financial accounts from his dealings in Ukraine on behalf of (presumably) the Podesta Group.


It will be interesting seeing how the nightly news spins this info as ""WE GOT TRUMP FOR RUSSIAN COLLUSION #IMPEACH #RESIST"".  Now, I don't like Trump as a politician and I don't like him as a person much either.  I'm classically liberal and having to defend Trump in the name of logic and common sense makes me feel icky.  There are plenty of other things to go after Trump on besides this Russia thing, to which I have seen no proof of.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was a big juicy decoy on behalf of the Trump Administration.  The Left takes the bait every time, while the Right moves on with their agenda.

45,"Work has been destroying me. I'm stressed, anxious, on the verge of panic all the time. I'm a cook. I have been for 8 years. It was the start of me ""getting my shit together,"" starting a new chapter, all that good stuff. It helped me out a lot, for years, but now it's turning into more and more problems.

I've worked my ass off for years. I've learned, practiced, done everything I can to get better, make myself good. My employers and I split paths. They're giving me a bad reference, despite all the hard work and effort I've put in with them. They say they're giving me a good reference, but I know from other sources they're lying to me. If they have a problem, they've never expressed it, but I've been passed over for promotions so many times there must be something they don't like, despite all the sacrifices I've made, the blood, sweat and tears I've dropped to make this place run.

I wanted to go to a ""nicer"" kitchen, learn some new stuff and make my way, but it's just not working. Today, I was 2 hours behind schedule when service started. I was working my ass off the whole time. I was always busy, hands full, always moving. There's just too much to do. I can't. I can't take it, I can't do this much work. I've worked so hard, so much, I've pushed my limits so far. I know what I can do and this is unreasonable. I don't know if I'm just not cut out for this, or what. I've spent the last 8 years making this my identity and now I feel so fucked up about it.

I'm too slow. Too sloppy. Too disorganized. Too clumsy.

It wasn't like this at my last job. I was practically god! I knew everything, could do everything as good or better than anyone else. Now I can't even keep up with my own tasks. I feel so worn out, tired, broken. I don't even know what I'm doing wrong but I'm not making it, despite everything I've done to make myself better.

I took a pay cut to come here. I'll take another if I go anywhere else, most likely. Just to start over?

I wish I could hit the reset button. I wish I could just start life over and get another chance. I know it doesn't work that way, but it's become one of my greatest fantasies now that I'm old enough to reflect on my life. I feel too old, too overworked, too out of touch. I don't even know what I want to do. I've just been trying to ""get through this"" for so long I don't even know where I am anymore.

People don't understand, either. Fellow cooks are like, ""Yeah, shit sucks. Deal with it."" Anyone outside the industry is like, ""surely it can't be that hard! You're just cooking food! Why not just switch industries?"" I would if I could. Nobody wants to hire a 30-year old chef trying to start a new life. I'm socially maladjusted, awkward and nervous. I definitely don't interview very well, despite being a reliable hard-working person looking to learn and grow. I just get social anxiety and can't deal with it. I shut off, panic, say the wrong things, panic, all I can think about is getting the fuck out of there. Panic.

My anxiety is getting out of hand. I need to control it but I don't know how. I can't afford professional help. At least I'm making enough to pay my bills, but past that I feel like I'm just treading water.

I'm just trying to get to a comfortable point in life. I think I need to leave the restaurant industry all together, but where is a guy like me supposed to go if I don't want to make minimum wage? I'm all out of answers.

I'm stressed. Anxious. Paranoid. My self-esteem has taken a huge blow. I used to be a little full of myself, now I'm such an empty shell. I don't know where I'm going or what I want. I feel constantly confused. I'm angry at myself for not having the answers, for not being better.

I come home and cry into my hands because I feel so fucking worthless and stupid for sending myself down this path. Why couldn't I have just paid attention in college instead of fucking that all up?

I don't know what else to say. It's been a hard day. I feel the pressure, feel myself cracking and I don't know what to do to keep myself from breaking.

I know a lot of this is in my mind. Still, my mind is my reality. I may be paranoid, anxious, scared, whatever, but I can't help myself from feeling this way. I can't just smile and stop worrying about work because if I get canned, there goes rent and groceries. I can't fake my way through this because not being perfect simply results in failure. I was 2 hours behind today, working my ass off and doing everything I could as quickly as possible. What can I possibly do to bridge that gap? Coupled with the lack of quality in my work, there's no way they're going to want to work with me. I'm not like this. I work well, I'm quick and precise and a hard worker, but I just can't work this system.

I feel like I'm going to explode. Or shut down. Or just go crazy. I don't know. I don't know what to do. I want to retreat. I want to conquer this. I want everything to make more sense. I want to stop crying. I just want to feel okay.

Where do I go? What do I do? I need to stop banging my head against the wall. I need to figure this out, badly. I need my sanity back.

47,"So. Two weeks ago I suffered a mild concussion in a soccer game. The only symptoms I’ve constantly had are headaches. Headaches never stop. I can’t play the sport I love. I can’t watch TV. I have to suffer through homework. I was told it’d be almost gone two weekends ago. Then last week I was told it would definitely be gone by Monday (today). It’s still here, and I can’t play until I am headache free for 24 hours, then have to complete a return to play process for 5/6 more days. My possible final game is on Saturday. This sucks. I feel horrible, and I don’t understand why I still have a headache two weeks later from a MILD concussion. ",30Oct2017,1
48,"I've been going through wholesale changes in my life, some good, some bad. I had a flashbulb memory moment and put on a song that I used to listen to 5-6 years ago to help me sleep/relax.  I haven't heard it once since that time frame.   

For whatever reason I decided to put it on and felt very comfortable, in a way nostalgia almost never is.  I felt like it brought me back to that point in time without any longing or sadness.  

Don't know why I feel so compelled to share this, but I guess it's somewhat rare to not hear one of your favorite pieces of music for years on end, and I'm glad for the experience. ",30Oct2017,1
49,"I am unsure about my feelings towards my girlfriend and it‘s making me kinda sad. I don‘t feel the same sparks like i did when we first met (it‘s just been 3 months) and today she told me she feels like i‘m taking her for granted, that i don‘t appreciate her (we didn‘t see each other for 2 weeks until then) and that i never ask her to meet me.  And she‘s kinda right. I feel like i‘m taking her for granted, i feel like i‘m a bad boyfriend but i don‘t know what i‘m supposed to do. I don‘t want to break up because i‘m „too nice“ for that (sounds shitty but when i make others sad i feel very bad myself). She texted me that she loves me and even though i can‘t tell her face to face i just wrote back that i do too and she asked me whether it‘s really true. I don‘t want to lie to her, i don‘t know what i‘m feeling myself but it‘s just really shitty atm.",30Oct2017,1
