That is what America is like right now. That's the only thing on its mind.
The industry is BOOMING. Jobs are being created left and right, for programmers, engineers--the works.
If you're good at that stuff, now is a good time to be alive for you.

But....for those who are not so inclined towards STEM, all suitable jobs are just disappearing.
There is no financial future in liberal arts, or hard labor...all other routes are shutting down, and it is creating this deadly funnel. Many are pushed through it and few survive.

What is the sense in that? Are historians not just as valuable in these days? Well I think they are..I KNOW them to be valuable...me asking your opinion was merely rhetorical.

Perfectly talented, healthy people are gonna suffer, I think...once the technocrats create machines to do their jobs.

And so, I feel purposeless in a world where people are being herded like sheep through this selection process called society...and either you make it in STEM or you die.

Mainstream society makes me feel like I have no place.
I cannot past the test, so I will be tossed aside. That's how I feel.
I wish I had a place where I could excel at my natural strengths, and feel like I have something to contribute, but that is not an option. I feel disabled.

It makes me want to kill myself.


TL;DR: I do not excel in STEM fields. There is intense pressure to go into STEM in America, and the opening of jobs in STEM, coupled with the simultaneous disappearance of jobs in literally every other industry, makes me feel like I should just kill myself because I don't have any financial future, and I am not seen as valuable this society that some hidden puppeteers are trying to forge.",11Apr2017,4

I think I really need weekends off. The problem with finding a new job is that I am getting paid a rate that I won't find anywhere else in my field.

**Note that anything said here are my personal views and opinions. They do not reflect the moderation team of any subreddit. It is completely anecdotal and unscientific.**

&amp;nbsp;

**First some backgound:**

I moderate two very active but different subs in /r/videos and /r/sweden. As a user, I have always been very much for user freedom. I hate censoring opinions, and I hate rules that are there to protect users ego. I have a background on forums with the absolute minimum of rule enforcement, and to this day I'm still drawn to to that to some degree. These opinions were a large part in why I was interested in taking part of the moderation in the first place so that I would have a say about these things. Why is this important? Hopefully it will help highlight the change in perspective that comes with taking the step from being a subscriber and/or contributor to being a moderator. This post is going to about the friction between the moderators of large subs and their user base. We see it time and time again. Large uprising of users against either rule changes or specific mod actions. The thing that frustrates me is that no matter how hard I try, and I've spent incredible amounts of time trying to explain to users why certain things are what they are; but very very rarely feel like I can get the point across. 

There are a lot of very good moderators, and also I'm sure quite a few crappy ones. I've been lucky enough to be able to say I've never worked with a moderator I'd consider bad. A lot that I don't agree with on specific things, but that has nothing to do with it. The moderators I have worked with are all incredibly passionate about their subreddits, and as far as I can tell act in good faith for what they believe is the best thing for the sub and it's user base. After all, most of them spend several hours a day doing menial point and click tasks over and over and over again, because that modqueue isn't gonna empty itself, and that user in modmail doesn't know I've already answered that questions 10 times in the past week. Okey, enough praise, let's get to the point!

&amp;nbsp;

I tend to divide the users into types. If I remove a popular post for breaking a rule, I can be fairly certain all of the following users will be represented to some degree:

* The excessively affronted - this group of users seems to take personal offence from what has been done. They CAN'T BELIEVE that this happened. The fucking moron moderator who did this must be utterly retarded. 

* The conspiracy theorists - these are the users who tries to figure out the underlying reason to why the specific action was taken. They tend to draw incredibly fast, shallow conclusions and extremely far fetched and unlikely theories emerge as a result. Mods are payed. Mods want to push political agenda. Mods hates fun. Mods are power tripping. 

* The trolls - hard group to characterize, and to be honest I'm not even convinced it exists in any larger scale. I think it's more out of bitterness that it's just easier to tell yourself that there is no possible way this person is for real. No way in hell. He HAS to be pulling my chain. 

* The reasonably unhappy - users who for valid reasons are concerned with, or disagree with a decision. They tent to speak up, but keep it on a reasonable and civil level.

* The silent majority - most people fall into this category. They are either happy or indifferent with the action taken. Let's face it, how many of /r/videos 12 million subs care enough to write a comment about a specific rule or mod action? My guess is not many. This is an incredibly important group though, just because it is to hard to gauge it. On the one hand we have a minority of arbitrary size that are screaming opinions, while the majority of our users are simply silent. It is an important group to not forget about, as it is the majority of the users, but at the same time it has the fewest people speaking for them. 

Most users, in my opinion, falls into one or two of these categories when it comes to drama on subreddits.

&amp;nbsp;

There is a lot of valid concern in many of the comments posted by all of the groups above, even though, sadly, it is often hidden behind heaps of rude name calling, far fetched conclusions and worst case scenarios. It IS important that moderators listens to the user base. It IS important that mods are unbiased and don't let political or other opinions affect the moderation. It IS important that the reasons behind the actions are genuine, and not because we are getting payed (I fucking wish) or have company affiliations. This I think everyone can agree on, no matter what type of user or moderator you happen to be. 

Before I start throwing out opinions and personal conclusions I want to touch on the job of the mdoerators. It's important to understand our side if we are ever wishing to bridge that gap. (I also like lists)

* Subs have a set of rules that in my experience are voted through by a majority of the team. 

* Every single moderator won't agree with every rule, but it is always stressed that the team keeps a united front when it comes to enforcing. Debate is constantly going on in the backrooms, but moderators are expected to enforce the agreed-upon rules no matter what they think of it. If a user raises concern, I will to the best of my ability try to explain the reasoning no matter if I agree with it or not. 

* Day to day moderation will be something like 95% clear and 5% borderline cases. It's always those 5% that causes controversy.

* It is encouraged to ask the opinion of your fellow mods on the really hard ones. This is both to try to avoid making unnecessary mistakes, and to make sure the action has support with the whole team that later might have to defend it. 

* We make mistakes. Anyone saying otherwise are lying. We make mistakes daily. With the amount of content posted, reported comments, modmails and really really hard edge cases I believe it's unavoidable to ever achieve perfect moderation.

* Yes, we are biased. Who isn't? We all have our own thoughts and opinions on everything from rules and how they are applied, to what our sub should look like, to if Marx was the best political filosofer of the century or not. I think users tent to blow this way out of proportion though. I'm a 100% honest when I say that don't think any moderator, on any sub I moderate can say how I lean politically. In my history of mod posts I've defended all sides depending on the situation, and tried to judge it neutral to the best of my ability. I'm sure I've fucked that up regularly, but even when I do there is very little harm done. No matter what political opinion I have, I would be discovered and called out by the other mods in a heartbeat if I started letting through shit with obvious bias. The users would spam modmail and my plan would be blown. I know I would be extreamly upset with any mod that tried to pull that shit, even if it appens to correspond to my personal opinion. It's not how shit should be done. Full stop. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Time for the fun stuff**

So what are the problems?

1. One of the big ones is that the users often don't get the reasons behind the rules and actions. Most moderators have a picture of what they want the subreddit to look like - and what it shouldn't look like. In my experience a lot of rules are created to keep the type of content consistent with what the creators, moderators and hopefully a majority of the users wants it to be. This is one of the reasons bigger subs tends to have a longer lists of rules, and sometimes oddly specific ones. I feel users sometimes forget what the purpose of a subreddit is. The whole point of Reddit is to create specific communities for specific content, how specific varies from sub to sub, but generally a subreddit will have some kind of theme. Within that niche we do however want diversity: /r/videos were made as a general place to post videos, but it was never ment to be filled with page after page of the same general theme. Even more so with /r/sweden where we have always worked hard to keep the content as diverse as possible within our limited theme. What happens is that a group of users, or sometimes a trent can hijack a whole subreddit. See the United Airlines drama going on over at /r/videos right now. If that doesn't fade away after a reasonable time we will be forced to take action. Not because we love United. Not because we are getting payed by United. Not because the admins are ordering us to. Simply because it sucks to have 3 pages of the same shit day after day after day. The moderators doesn't want the sub to look like that, and I hope the majority agrees with me. These memes are fine and fun for a while, but after a point they have to go. This is the exact reasoning behind the total ban on politics on both /r/videos and /r/sweden. It's a subject that tends to overshadow everything. I was a strongly opposed to that rule when we implemented it on Sweddit since I love everything politics, but I can't argue with the result. And in the end, that's why reddit is great: when a specific type of content ""outgrows"" it's subreddit and start to shut all other content out, it is better to create a new sub for that specific thing and give more room to other stuff we want to see. It has nothing to do with what mods think about the specific subject. If I want to see videos of police harassment, I go to /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut. If I want to see people beating eachother up there are numerous subs for that. If I want to read about Swedish politics I go to /r/svenskpolitik. It isn't about censoring opinions, or users or topics. We CAN'T do that on reddit even if we wanted to. It's about what the sub is, and what we want the sub to be. 

2. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. This one is incredibly frustrating. There are a lot of situations where we as moderators simply can't win. If we have a rule, for whatever reason, we have to enforce it. No rule is perfect, and sadly it always has the effect of catching some really great content that we'd rather let slip past. Problem is this approach is a minefield. The users expects consistent and unbiased moderation, and rightly so. Because of this most teams strive to write rules as unambiguous and clear cut as possible. This is for our own sake as much as for the users. When you have to cast judgement on sometimes hundreds of submissions a day, the clearer the rule, the easier it gets. It is also very very hard and embarrassing to try to defend inconsistent moderation. We remove videos of police violence every day on /r/videos. Then suddenly this one particular video pops up that people are very passionate about. It is a clear cut case. There are obvious cops (says ""POLICE"" with big fat letters on their backs) remove a man off a plane by force, knocking his head as a result. Removing that video is 100% in line with our enforcement of that rule. But the emotions it causes, in combination with us reacting way to slow to remove it in the first place has now caused an enormous backlash. The user base instantly grabs the pitchforks and the circus begins. We are payed by the airline. The admins told us to remove it because they lose add revenue (???). One of our mods is a cop so we are doing it to protect the LEOs. It makes me wanna scream! So what are they saying? Should we let shit slip at our personal discretion? Isn't that the thing we are trying NOT to do? Wouldn't the same users then start another drama train when next time we do it and it doesn't align perfectly with what they think is important enough to ignore the rules? How do we win here? What do we do to not get shit thrown at us? We can't be both neutral and biased at the same time. Either the rules applies, or they don't. 

3. Damned if you do, damned if you don't version 2 (AKA communicating with the users). This connects back to the list of user types above. When all hell breaks lose the moderators have two option: communicate with the users and try to explain the situation, or stay quiet, don't stir the pot more than necessary and ride it out. If you ask a bunch of moderators I'm sure the opinion on what the right thing to do will differ wildly. I've always been in the first group, but with time I'm being pushed closer and closer to the second group. I still belive that communication and openness is the right way to go in principle, but at the same time there is only so much a group of 10-20 people can do against thousands of angry users. What pisses me off about this is that group one, two and three above ruins it for everyone else. They simply win by attrition. There are only som many comments I have the energy to write while at the same time feeling like I'm not getting the point across. It's really really hard to not get upset. I try to figure out if it me explaining it in bad way. Or is it because English isn't my first language? Is it because they WANT to stir drama, and won't give in no matter what I say? Are they really really dense and simply can't understand why we did what we did, even if they might not agree? Are they Trolls? I am simply so disconnected that I'm plain wrong and it's me that is the problem? 
I hate pandering to those groups of users. I hate it with a passion. Because you scream the loudest and use the worst profanity doesn't mean your opinion is more valid than anyone else's. Now a days I'm too jaded to care about 99% of the users in those groups. I try to save my time and energy for group four, while trying my best to protect and figure out what group five wants. You guys are the reason I'm still doing this. A civilized, constructive post is always greatly appreciated, no matter if it agrees with the action or not. I trying to make a point out of awarding those kind of comments, both as a fuck you to group 1-3 and because they are genuinely fun to respond to. 

4. Who decides what a sub should look like? I am definitely not the right person to answer this, as I'm very biased, but I'm gonna do it anyway because I want to. This is borderline philosophy. Who gets to decide what is right or wrong for a subreddit? Is it the original creator and top mod? The moderation team as a whole? The majority of the userbase? The best contributors? I belive all of these groups have some claim to that right. The problem as I see it is that there is an imbalance in power. The moderators, although putting up a lot of time and effort have nearly (but not all) the power. The contributors of high quality, original content also put in a lot of time and effort but have way less direct power. The user base in general is what makes up the subreddit itself, but is also split among themselves. There is a lot of balance going on here. The sub is nothing without its contributors. But the contributors are nothing without a general userbase to view and discuss the content. The moderators are kind of the arbiters that try uphold some semblance of a structure among all the shitposts, at the same time as they have a right to their opinion due to the work and effort they put in. This is dangerous for the mods. We so have opinions, and I belive we have a right to those. At the same time we are sitting on the most direct power. We are the only once that can actually effectively enforce our opinions, mostly because it's impossible for any of the other groups to unite behind anything at all. So how do we balance our opinions with the users opinions? How do we even accurately KNOW the users opinions? Group 5 above is the most important one, but also the hardest one to grasp and to discuss with. How do we guess what the users want, while trying to gauge how much of the uproar is a small vocal minority or genuine concern? We all know by now (at least we should) that upvotes are a terrible way to actually measure the opinion of the user base. Both due to the fact, again, that many users don't bother to vote, or doesn't see the thread and for the fact that there is no way of knowing how many of those votes are from the actual core users we care about, and how many are just passing by, seeing the post in /new or /all or even worse brigading from other subs to push an agenda. If you know the answer to this, please enlighten me. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Final words**

Okey I think that's mostly it. It's 4 AM here and I just typed this in one session straight out of my head, so I hope it isn't too incoherent. I'll read through it again tomorrow to fix any errors or remove anything to OT. I apologize for any mistakes. English isn't my native language, so be nice when pointing them out =)

Users, all I ask is to give the moderators of the subs you like benefit of the doubt. Most of us do the best we can to create communities that people enjoy. Please call out any biased decisions or actions you don't agree with. Keep it civil, both because it is more likely you will be listened and responded to, and because it's the right thing to do. Moderators, try not to become too jaded. I know I suffer from this, and it has caused me to lose interest in moderating lately (sorry everyone over at /r/videos and /r/Sweden). Don't defend shitty moderating. I'm convinced we have everything to gain in the long run to swallow pride and back down if it turns out we were wrong. Ignore the haters, they are not worth the time. Remember that in the end we all want basically the same thing, it's just really really hard to agree on the best way to get there.

If anyone has any comment or thoughts, please share them!

14,"So I've been going to a trade school for pre engineering since I was a sophomore. I'm a senior now. I go to a regular high school for half the day and trade school the other half.

17,"Hello. I didn't really know where to put this, so if anyone has an idea where I might get some help with it, it'd be appreciated.

There's a TL;DR if you don't want to bother with this wall.

But for now I'm here, and I could really use some help with getting some answers.

I'll try keep it short, but I'm 15, and since I was around 7 I've been ""homeschooled"". I say it like that because my parents, the people who were supposed to be teaching me, sort of gave up. I can't blame them, don't get me wrong, but it makes me pretty mad that they never sent me to public school when they didn't want to teach me. They think school is useless and doesn't teach you anything, and I can sort of agree that not all of it is necessary, but I don't think it's useless.

Anyway, since then, I've been pretty much teaching myself, but my motivation is extremely small. I know the very basics, reading, writing (although my grammar needs work), math (just the very basics). And because of this I'm a few grades behind. But I want more of an education, I want to be able to go to college or something and get an education and job in something I like, actually be social instead of secluded most of the time, and right now I'm throwing my time away. Some of that's my fault. And I know college and stuff isn't everything, but still.

TL;DR: 15 year old kid is behind a few grades because of being homeschooled by parents that didn't teach anything.

I just have a few questions:

Since I'm a few grades behind, what would a school do if I tried to go to a public school? I know there's an entrance exam, but beyond that, I don't know what happens. What would the school do when I inevitably fail it?

Would the school ask my parents what they've been doing with my education? Would they get in trouble?

Is there some other option besides school? I want to go because I need things to do and meet people, which sounds weird, but I feel like I'm missing out, even though it might not be a good experience..

Any other advice would help.

I'm just worried about my future, and school probably won't change that much, but I feel like it's something I need to do, that it might help my situation. I left out a few things, and hopefully the pity-party stuff, since that's not what I'm here for.

Sorry for the wall of text, and thanks if you've read it. It's a dumb question and I should just force my parents to put me in or something but it's worrying.

Anyway, it's almost 2am, I didn't sleep yesterday, so I think I need to now and I won't be able to reply to anyone until tomorrow (If anyone even bothers to). Bad time to post it, I guess. And if you're up at this time, what are you doing? Really, go to sleep. Or don't, a 15 year old on the internet's not the boss of you.

18,"You know the moment. The second when you're staring into the eyes of the person you love and you're bearing your naked soul for them to embrace. You're thinking about the future, about your future with them. All of the prosperous and exuberant times to come fill your mind with serenity and love. Finally it seems like all the pain and hardships in your life had a purpose. Despite all the rough paths in your previous life they were the paths that led you to them, to those gorgeous sparkling hazel eyes in front of you. It's like a huge weight being lifted off your shoulders. At last you can breathe again because you no longer have to fight. You are where you're supposed to be. 

Then those beautiful eyes drop from yours. The pink lips that you've traced with your tongue part, and the words they utter slash at you. This is the moment. The moment when the world falls away, when you can physically feel your heart being brutally ripped, shredded, and torn into a mush of pulsating bloody meat. You can't breathe. You can't feel your body. The sound of your own blood steadily draining from the open wound in the centre of your chest floods your ears. This is the moment when you lose everything. This is where the one fucking thing that you want more than anything in the world simply walks away from you. But that's not even the worst part. The worst part is that you can't stop it. You contributed and are now helpless to your own undoing. The thing that you have loved, cared for, and put first before even yourself is the thing that has destroyed you. 

You're alone now. There are bits and remnants of you on the ground. Try as you will to collect them all, but they will never fit back together the way that they did before. A piece is missing now, a very crucial piece. You will never get that fragment back and you will never be whole again. You plug the leak, you slice away the dead flesh, you cut off the limb, you do what you have to to survive. But in the deepest trenches of your mind you know that you can't do it forever. There is only one thing that will truly and permanently fix you, to get you back to your peace and tranquility....... and it does not want you.  ",11Apr2017,10
20,"So here's how it goes, I'm a junior in high school and I am apart of a video editing class. I am one of the 3 people in the class that know how to edit video very well. Not even the teacher knows the slightest bit about editing.

This whole thing started a couple months back while I was waiting for some files to transfer. I sat in a chair with my feet up talking to a friend and my teacher walks in and tells me to get to work. I attempt to inform him of my situation in waiting for the files, but he cuts me off and walks out of the room. Since then he always has seemed to have this view of me as someone who never worked. 

-The next things are what led up to the main event:

A few times in the next month he had come over to me, while I was editing video, like in the process of cutting clips and such, and he tells me to get to work, while I am working. 

I used to be a main part of discussion in the class, I was the main brainstormer for new segments and instructed others on how to edit and the processes one should go through before exporting(finalizing) their video. As usual I tried to discuss with the kid next to me on some of his video, but my teacher, who stood right next to him, said ""Hey why don't you work on your own work."" Or in similar situations, he has quite literally shoo'd me like a bug. I simply stopped talking in that class at all, because I just wasn't getting treated like I was helping anyway.

A couple weeks pass and we are producing our news show. We are shooting the show live and I am the one who 'produces it' (I switch the cameras around and such) we are running very low on time so I say that we need to do a practice run to make sure we have got it down. He immediately freaks out and yells saying ""You all just want to sit around and do nothing, just like you always do."" Now he is not only saying I don't do any work, but that everyone else, that works as hard as they can, does nothing at all. 
That was the last straw on my end, and I ended up snapping, in a rather calm voice though, ""I'm pretty sure I'm producing a show right now"" 
He stands up and starts yelling a lot louder now  ""don't you ever talk to me like that again...who do you think you are... you're not producing today..."" he turns my computer chair towards the door are tells me to leave.
As I'm walking out he says ""What do you think you're doing...""
I simply reply with ""work""
He then proceeded to yell ""Noooooo""

Anyway, time passes after this, there is a lot of tension between us. In this class, you are graded upon participation points and nothing else. Everyone's grade in the class is an A, because everyone tries their hardest as stated. My grade goes from an A- (which is confusing) to a B- (which is Infuriating) to a C- (which is worse than my pre-calc grade) 
At this point I'm still doing my normal amount of work I had done before, I am an avid editor so I tend to finish projects early but there's only so much to edit which at some point I run out of things to do. My grade is obviously influenced by bias because I was working with a partner on a project and I was doing the more work out of the two of us(because the other didn't know how to edit). My partners grade remained an A, whilst mine was now a C-

I confront my teacher about the situation, I inform him that I am doing work and tell him that I can show him the work I have been doing. He cuts me off and says ""Alright alright I'll give you an A+ in the class IF you start working"" he proceeds to give me an A-.

We are now much later, maybe a month or two. He pulls a couple of us aside and states that there has been a tradition. That he will set the juniors aside and let the juniors and sophomores take over. 
As he's explaining this to me I'm like ""Okay cool, I'll have more work to do, this is good"" (because I am a junior). But no. He says that I have disappointed him in my work output and that me(and the 3 others that he pulled aside) are a distraction to those who are working. 

He says that he will give us a B for the semester and that we CANNOT work in the usual things, such as adobe programs. BUT we can play cool math games and study for other classes. He says that he talked to the principle about it and that is was approved, which I find hard to believe. This just happened today. 

P.S. There is a back room, a sort of studio where the green screen and such is. Me and my friend usually eat lunch in there along with other people of the class. But with this new ""not allowed to work"" policy comes that I cannot enter the studio. BUT people who are not in the class are still aloud in there for lunches and such. Just thought I'd add that. 

Please HELP ME. What do I do now? Go to a counselor? Go to the principle? I don't know, is he in the right? I know I shouldn't of had an attitude with him, but I cannot just let myself be pushed around. Thanks for reading.

22,"It's a long story as to how it all came about but the guy is an ass so I am glad he's gone. I feel bad for my brother but even he admits that he's happy the guy is gone though he feels guilty for how it went down.


Anyway, a little info for clarification. I'm the youngest of three siblings and the only girl. I'll call my brother's J and D. D is the oldest. J is the middle child and the one I live with. He's also the one who was in a relationship with this guy... let's call him Dumb-ass.



Now D actually has been staying with us for a few weeks before moving into an apartment and J an I have been very happy about this because Dumb-ass is less of a dumbass when D is there.



Last night D went to hang out with some friends and Dumb-ass started being a dick. Getting mad at my brother for stupid shit. Of course I don't say anything because it's their relationship and I figure if my brother is willing to put up with it he must have a reason. Thankfully nothing really came of that but D was out all night and this morning I woke up to Dumb-ass screaming at the top of his lungs. I quickly realized he was yelling at someone on the phone. He's been having bank issues and I assume it was that. He was yelling and storming around the house. My cats were scared and even the bravest of them who is never scared ran into my room. I got up and shut the door.



I figured he'd blow off steam and as long as I knew my pets were safe I'd not worry about it as J was asleep an Dumb-ass was prone to temper tantrums.



I heard him go outside and after a while it got quiet again. My cats started scratching to be let out of my room so I opened my door and went back to my computer.



Next thing I know I hear Dumb-ass come in the house screaming ""JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!"" and slamming the door. He gets back on the phone and I hear him screaming at what must have been the automated system, ""OPERATOR! GET ME A FUCKING OPERATOR!""



Then I see D's car pull up. I can't tell you how relieved I felt. I heard Dumb-ass go back outside (probably got off the phone) and I just figured D would calm him down, he always does. But I guess not. Dumbass comes back in the house again and gets back on the phone but D stays outside, probably to have a smoke.



By this time I guess J got up because he heard the screaming and asked what was wrong. I (still in my room) hear, ""I don't get fucking social security anymore! Why couldn't they tell me this three months ago?"" Turns out he'd checked the mail while he was outside and there was a letter telling him he'd lost his SSI.



J told him to calm down. I heard the phone conversation, it seems that his renewal stuff was sent to the wrong address. Of course the first thing I realize is that this is something that can be fixed. I heard Dumb-ass change his address with them when he first moved in. I know he can go to the office in town here and fix it. Turns out that is was J was trying to tell him but Dumb-ass wouldn't listen. He started shouting that he wouldn't calm down, he was so angry he could kill someone.



He goes into the kitchen and gets a knife and starts screaming, ""Who wants to die?""



I hear him go outside and yell back and forth with D who was still on the porch but I don't know what was said other than Dumb-ass shouting ""Do you want to die? Who wants to die?""



D told me later that he told Dumb-ass to put the knife away and get back in the house or he would call the police. Well, Dumb-ass didn't listen. He ran down the street with a butcher's knife screaming ""Who wants to die??""



D came in to ask for the number to the police, I told him just call 911. That's when D and J told me about the knife. D told us to stay in the house so we stood in the kitchen looking out the window hoping for Dumb-ass to come back before he did something stupid. After a few minutes we saw him come back. 



D told him to stay in the driveway because he wasn't coming back in this house. He told him he called the police. Dumb-ass said, ""You called the police? Why would you do that? Do you want to die? I should kill you!"" He then rushed at my brother on the porch.



D just stood there, spread his hands apart and basically looked at him like, ""Come try it.""



I was scared to death. I saw Dumb-ass rush him, I saw him lunge with a knife a few times but never quite having the balls to go through with it. It really looked like he wanted to but then the police showed up and he dropped the knife.



He didn't really resist arrest, he let them cuff him pretty quick but then he started screaming and shouting that this was the end and the cops should just kill him. He basically had a meltdown on our front lawn.



I felt so bad for J because he was crying. It hurt to watch but at the same time Dumb-ass brought it on himself. The cops took some information and said they were going to take him in and process him and they'd be back in a few hours for our statements and everything.



We've heard nothing from them since. D seems to think that he probably did something stupid so they don't actually need our statements but it still seems odd that they have not called or come by and this all happened 11 hours ago.



I'm SO happy that guy is gone. I hope he gets the help he obviously needs but the cops not coming back just seems so weird. Anyone have any idea why that might be? Should I contact them and find out what's going on?



I've never had dealings with the police where they weren't very clear about next steps.

23,"A close friend of mine has ended the longest period in her life since the age of 9 that she has gone with harming herself. She stopped for 2 and a half months and I thought she was doing a little better. I found I was wrong. All it take to break your heart it seems in an apology. ""I'm sorry. I'm so sorry (turbulenttimbits). Please don't hate me if you see them."" I didn't have a clue. I try so hard to keep her talking openly to me. I god knows how many times I've stayed up until the wee hours of the morning, talking to her when she feels the urge, or comforting her and hoping it doesn't happen again. I thought she was ok though. She wasn't, and I failed my friend.

Sorry I'm not as good with words as most of you.",11Apr2017,2
26,"Alright, first off, I wanna say that this post might seem really silly to most of you. I know I'll get a lot of ""oh get over it""s. Just please bare with me as this is something that's weighing extremely heavy on my heart right now.

When I was 3 years old, Santa brought me this amazing gift. Of course, toddler me saw the bigger box behind it and went straight towards it. Finally after finding out the bigger box was for my older brother, I caught glimpse of a kennel. In the kennel was the most precious little thing. We opened the kennel and a little white puppy with black spots, and brown fur lining his cheek bones and eyebrows crawled out. ""It looks like rust on his cheeks!"" my brother said. So we called him Rusty.

Rusty and I grew up together. I saw him learning how to climb the stairs, and he saw me  learning how to ride a bike. Rusty would soon run the grass down while chasing the other dogs outside of the fence like an eager zoo animal in his enclosure. But once he was set free to run around the park behind our house, he was as happy and care-free as I've ever seen any dog. He loved to follow us around the house, just for the pure fact that he wanted to be near us. I used to lay on the floor and let him roll in my hair almost every morning. I don't know why he loved it so much, but he did, so I loved doing it.

When he had an accident in the house, I was the one he seemed to hide behind when it was time to face the music. Whenever my mom would cook, he came to me for comfort because he knew the piercing sound of the smoke detectors was about to follow. He saw me through the tears of trying to learn long division in elementary school, which turned to fights with best friends in middle school, then to heartbreak through high school.

He was there to offer up all the kisses and snuggles I could ask for when I was hyperventilating having an oh so common anxiety attack. He was the only being I felt truly loved and cared for me when I was struggling with depression. He sensed that I was upset from a different room in the house, even when it wasn't showing on my face. He helped me through it all when I was laying on my bedroom floor sobbing with no desire to continue on in life. I looked up and made eye contact with him as he walked over to sit guard by my side as I had always done for him.

He was my best friend. He knew me better than anyone else. He didn't even know what I was saying. But trust me, he understood everything.

One day, he struggled to get up the stairs. Not in the same adorable way as he did when he was a puppy, but in a sad, I-don't-want-to-acknowledge-that-he's-getting-old kind of way. He started to slow down, a lot. Every few days or so, however, he would bounce back and act just as he did when he was a puppy. Those were just the good days when his heart pumped enough oxygen-rich blood to his brain. After 16 long years on this earth, the bad days started to outweigh the good. He was tired, could hardly move, and wouldn't even eat the chicken we gave him, which says a lot.

The day before his last, I was laying on the floor, letting him roll in my hair as I did almost every morning since he's been a part of my life. Once he had rolled and tangled in my hair to his satisfaction, he looked me in the eyes and gave me a big lick right on the lips. Not knowing it would be his last night with us, I squealed with an ""ew!"" as I got up to wash it off. I wish I would have stayed on the floor with him.

I once heard someone say ""People are put on this earth to learn how to live a good, selfless life. Dogs already know how to do that, so they don't have to be here as long.""

I wish I wouldn't have taken advantage of every wet kiss, and every time he curled up next to me. I wish I wouldn't have taken advantage of getting to take him on walks and seeing him sprint to get a treat after he knew he deserved one. I wish I would have played with him more, or been home more to be with him during those last tiring days.

After everything he helped me through, I don't think I will ever love any dog the same. My relationship with Rusty was unlike one I've ever had with any human, and my heart will ache for a long, long time after losing him.

I would do anything to have you back and to be able to say a final goodbye. I love you Rusty-rojo-mojo-bobo

27,"I believe I got this from my non-N father (I live with him right now just over a month ago from Nmother).

He have a ""stone"" ego. Like it's a struggle to deflate it. He does it with his wife and children.

Like it's almost a struggle for us to say ""no"" and argue.

He's also a show-off and vane. 

He thinks he's very smart (he's a teacher) and people around him seem to look stupid.

He corrects everything we do which I find very annoying. Like every ambiguity that we say and do should be corrected. And he also tells you what to do all the time like a know-it-all person.

He's also selfish. It's a struggle for him to share.

Nmother told a story about him about how he didn't feel the love of his mother (I'm not sure, it could be both or either of the parent, it could be false). I think that's why. He also kind of not showing love that much.

No wonder she married this guy.

29,"It happened on a narrow two-lane road so when I came around the small curve I was right there. I pulled off the road and onto the side in a small ditch (I drive a Jeep) to get out of the way and and see if I could help. I saw the motorcyclist on the road and I knew the person most likely didn't survive. I had never seen something like that, or been right up on an accident and I saw a lot and it was bad. The victim looked to be a teenage boy and an older man was kneeled next to him and crying while saying he was sorry and he didn't mean to do it. I'll never forget that and I close my eyes and see it so vividly. 911 had been called so I pulled out of the ditch and around the motorcycle and truck that was involved and after I got up the road a bit I had to pull over and compose myself. I was still shaken by what I had seen when I returned home and was debating on Googling for information about the accident and victim when my daughter told me that it was not a teenage boy that I had seen; it was her cosmotology instructor who I also went to high school with, knew her casually then and more recently I know her as my kid's instructor. She had been out for a ride on her bike (cycle) and drifted into the next lane and in front of the truck who had no way fo avoid hitting her. Like I said it is a narrow scenic two lane road. So she is who I saw in that condition. It was the man driving the truck who was kneeling beside her and crying and telling her he was sorry. I cannot get this out of my head. The visual, what I saw, I can't unsee that. I worry about the man in the truck who hit her. He had no way to avoid hitting her and I wonder how he's holding up. I hope her family knows he was with her and beside her out there. I can't seperate what I saw from how I know she looked and how much she didn't look that way at the end. It's rattled me and I'm shook. I'm leery to get behind the wheel and I worry for my loved ones driving, especially my 19 yr old daughter. She and her classmates have taken food and baskets of supplies to her instructor's family. She (my daughter)  appears to be handling this well but when will I stop seeing what I saw on that road?

32,"hello everyone, i am not sure whether i'm posting in the right subreddit so i hope to be redirected if i'm in a wrong place. i am 23 y/o, struggle with bipolar 2 and anxiety. i've been in a depressive episode for over a year now. 

i've been dealing with angry episodes since i first started showing symptomps of BAP as a young teenager. i was always a feisty, stubborn child. i thought it would go away with puberty. i had epsiodes such as smashing things against the wall, filling pillowcases with rubber to throw it against the wall, punching my wardrobe and wall with my fist until it bled. i started drinking young, and by drinking i mean getting wasted and getting promiscuous. luckily, my substance abuse hasn't gotten further from using pot. also, i have been obsessed with my weight for as long as i can remember and have always been on the heavier side of the scale, since i use food as weapon against myself.

since the beginning of the ongoing depressive episode, i have been struggling to keep my self-destructive behaviour as low as possible because of it possibly interfering my newest therapy. i don't go out and have a drink every couple of weeks, i've stopped smoking cigarettes and smoke pot every few months. however, a few days ago i've had a panic attack and i don't know what triggered it. i started slapping my face as hard as i can. then i stopped, then i slapped it more until it burned and then started punching myself and banging my forehead against the door. my mom ran to me and stopped me. i couldn't help myself, i just felt the urge to do it and it made the crying and screaming easier for me. this is the first time i've done something like this since 2012 when i slapped myself only once, in front of my then-boyfriend, midst-fight.

i reckon it's connected to the feeling of helplessness and restlessness. please, if anyone has experience with this kind of abuse, please reach out to me. i scare myself and i don't know how to channel this anger. i don't have any past of cutting. ",11Apr2017,5
33,"I was 25 back then, less than a year after breaking up with a guy who was my first everything that I've dated since I was 15. I was in a dog show when I met this guy. We became friends, then lovers and it ended up with nightmare.

In hindsight, it was a parade of red flags.

*He always repeatedly said how he is MORE/better than men his age/generations. (Smarter, wiser, kinder, healthier, romantic, etc...) As if trying to emphasis how special and different he was. The truth was the only way he was more than other men of his age was: more insecure, more cowardly, more angry, etc.

*He dropped his hobbies and friends and even his job just to be with me...**without me even ever asking him!**.
This is for me personally the biggest red flag in men and women. I will not even entertain the idea of befriending such person.
The whole act of 'I will isolate myself so that I can solely focus my time and energy for you' is usually being followed with 'why don't you do the same for me!!!!' and 'I have sacrificed so much for you, now you must be compelled to stay.'

*Every kind gesture has some kind of hook behind it.
This one was what hurts me the most even to this very day and it even makes me hate humanity for a while. It makes you paranoid to the point of a simple act of him getting you a glass of water and you accept it, can bite you in the ass later.

*Putting you in pedestal, but dare you slightly move away from that pedestal. Critiques, so many critiques. He even said that I will ended up on the street even after he saw how much money I have in my savings...just cause I like to travel once in a while.

*The only trip is guilt trip. Nice guys also nice girls, I suppose, are masters of guilt tripping. If they feel miserable, you have to feel miserable too. They got ebola? Here, why don't you get some ebola too? What? You don't want ebola? I THOUGHT YOU LOVE ME!!!   

Thankfully it was only a 3 months relationship...but it has a bitter sequel of him trying to stalk and intimidate for 'second chance' cause I am his only destinyyyyy. Turned out to be he was wrong. His destiny was being reported to the police for stalking and getting some restraining order.

Learn from my mistake everyone. **Don't date Nice Guy/Nice Girl**, let these two psychos find and date each other.



**Edit:**Please don't confuse 'Nice Guy/Nice Girl' with genuinely kind guys/girls.

34,"Back a few years ago I used to care. About everything. School, social status, friends, girls. I'd care so damn much. I used to stress so hard over grades, wonder if people liked me. I spent all my school life always anxious about pretty much everything. I was worried I wasn't making the most of my youth in whatever way. I used to get myself down cause everyone would go out, party, drink, etc. and I'd be sitting hearing about the good times everyone was having. I was so desperate to connect deeply with someone, and I just knew if I could get more social that someone would get me and I'd find someone. I knew I'd be popular (I actually cared about this lmao), find a girl who understood me, and be the person I wanted to be. But I never got invited. I instead would focus on studying my ass off. It made me feel like shit just going for grades all the time but it was all I had control over.

In the last year of school though, something inside me started to change. I got the grades I wanted, and was just there to try have a social life. And I did. I put myself out there. I went to parties. I got drunk. I took some drugs. I'd have a good night and then in the morning I'd realise I'm back to square one. Nobody was looking for a deep connection at these parties like I was. To really get to know someone. It was just for the sake of being there. I can't really describe it, but the whole teenage idea of socialising just feels so hollow.

Now school's ended and I have a solid group of friends who I go out and get shitfaced with every weekend. Kind of like I always wanted. But while I love these guys, and I do enjoy going out with them, apart from that I feel like I've lost something. Like this is all I have now. While I used to care about everything, over the last few years I've kind of become emotionally numb and don't care. I used to worry about my future constantly, now I don't give a shit in all honesty. That should scare me, but it doesn't really. I go to uni, but I'm just scraping by. Sometimes I just don't go cause getting out of bed is too much of a task. There's no effort put in. I work at a fast food place, but it's just cause I'd feel useless without a job and in all honesty I'm pretty shit at my job and constantly fuck up. And when I'm not working, it doesn't bother me. If I could lie in my bed for the rest of my life watching TV or whatever I would do it. I sleep until 2 in the afternoon like everyday cause I have nothing better to do and I'm always tired. Often my parents ask me to do something, like go see a movie or something, and I just refuse because I can't be bothered. I just don't care about anything anymore. My life is just working/going to class and going out to a bar or club with my friends once a week if I get the chance. It's as if I got tired of worrying about things and now I just block everything out.

I have no aims. I don't even think I could come up with a single goal for myself. The only thing I find myself wanting is a girlfriend as stupid as it sounds. As if any girl's gonna want to go near a guy who has no aims, who's as lazy and boring as I am now. And as if that would fix anything. Hell, I can't even think of things to say to people anymore. When I have a conversation I feel like I'm on auto-pilot and not even saying things that fit with who I am. Like I have nothing to really talk about so I just wing it. I don't do anything. I don't experience anything truly interesting. I feel like I need to connect with someone who will snap me out of this shit and give me something to live for, to make me WANT to have goals. But I'm not gonna find that. Not like this. I just don't know where I went wrong or what I can change. In all honesty I'm content to just keep wasting away doing nothing and I suppose thinking about it it does kind of scare me. But not enough to snap me out of inaction. I'm just stuck.",11Apr2017,2
35,"Two weeks ago I was at this cool party thing and I locked eyes with this amazing girl, we barely talked as we both seemed shy but then got to talking and even dancing together. She's a yoga teacher and nurse and a solid 9 in my book. She was also 25 and I'm 18 so I was kind of shy about that one.

The party ended and we exchanged numbers and I texted her right after saying it was great meeting her and flirting a little bit. A week later she texts me at 10 pm asking to hang out which I didn't think much of. We never went out because she was too tired from work so we made plans to go to the art museum the next day.

Now I'm the kind of person who likes to be direct and know what he is getting himself into. So when we made these plans I didn't know if we were just going as friends or was this more of a dating environment. After going back and forth in my mind, I just did what I don't usually do...'just go with the flow' (bad choice).

The time was great with her as we hung out at the museum and she asked a lot of date-like questions but I still didn't know if to act on it because when I **know** I'm going to a date I'm great and always got the girls to a second one, but this not knowing threw me off.

We left the museum and were walking through a park together and I had a perfect chance to hold her hand as our hands brushed but again I didn't act on it. I know I should have gone for it and just take the risk of rejection but I didn't. We then went and had smoothies together where I paid for her as the supposed date was winding down.  At this point, I was still confused on where this was going or went at this point.

We walked outside to say goodbye (where I would usually go for that first kiss if I knew it was a date) and she awkwardly said  ""Well..er..thanks for hanging out with me"" I could hear in her voice that she expected more from this and I didn't deliver. I was subtly kicking myself the rest of the day for that missed chance. And after texting her the day after she just read it and didn't respond. Ouch

I know now to flat out ask next time if we are considering this a date or not because I see what happens when I don't. I want a second chance with her because she's a great girl though I suppose I'm at peace if that doesn't happen. I would love some comforting words if any but damn this really sucks.

My problem is that time after time, when these games fail to sell, or get backlash from the video game community, the publisher attacks men and blames them for the failure of their own business strategy, vision, execution, etc.

It's no secret that the majority of gamers are guys. You can argue women are catching up, but still, you should be clear-headed when you start a project and really find who your fans are and give them the things they want, even if its different from what the general female population wants in a game.

If they want male fantasy narratives, and you give them identity politics in their games, they are justified in not buying your game or voicing their dissatisfaction.

I already tried contracting the mods, but they have not giving me a reply or told me to contact the other mods which furthers my suspicion on why I was removed without any warning at all.

As of now, I cannot post or comment on /r/Gaming and /r/InterestingAsFuck (both subreddits having similar moderators).

My theory is the two subreddits are on damage control and do not wish to remove the powermod I was exposing because of his contribution to their subreddits through popular reposts that reach the frontpage of /r/All thus brushing the incident under the rug along with me.",11Apr2017,40

I have never petted a dog. Where I live, there are lots of stray dogs on the streets but people are usually afraid of them. There is a stray kitten who pretty much lives permanently on our doorstep because I feed her the leftovers of my cats.  
For the past month or so, when I feed the kitten, a dog comes and chases it away and eats the food. The dog used to wait until I left and would then chase away the kitten. Slowly she became bolder and would come up to me while I was giving the kitten the food. Now she comes with her pupper. As much as I wish, I usually don't have any food for them but I make sure to give them water because it's terribly hot.  
They both have become pretty friendly but I am still a bit afraid. I would like to pet them but I have seen a lot of people who have gotten bit by dogs and I'm not sure if petting a stray dog is a good idea.  

Oh, and my cats are absolutely fascinated by the dogs. They are indoor kitties but when the dogs come, they hang out near the door to peek at them. The pupper has even come inside my house twice but left straight away. I think I can try petting him but he seems quite shy and I'm afraid of petting the mommy-dog.",11Apr2017,7

59,"After my accident one year ago, I could barely walk. I am only 21, but my life tried my strength. I was kept in bed for half an year, I did therapy and I struggle with pain everyday. I started to walk slowly and for short periods of time a few months ago. 

Today it was my first day at the pool. I started to swim to recover faster. I did it. I feel exhausted, but amazing. Pain got worse, but only because my muscles got atrofied (i hope it is the right word) during these months with no movements at all. Now I will be ok. I am finally OK! I felt happiness. 


Edit: I really never thought I can become so emotional. It may be the isolation period, or I don't know, but all this support made me cry badly. I never thought I mayb be important to people in such a way. 

Even the slightest message in here is wonderful! Thank you SO MUCH! You motivate me to keep going! I wish I could bring such happiness into your lives as you brought in mine with this support. 
I apologize if I am being too emotional. It may be the pain I feel, or the lonleyness I feel, or anything, but it has been the best night of my last year. 

Thank you deeply! Stay awesome!",11Apr2017,407

Sure, the airline could have handled it differently, but when the police ask you to do something you don't resist.  That's civics 101.  Also, I didn't see anyone volunteering to leave their seat so that guy didn't get blasted by the police.  They just screamed, videod, and thanked god it wasn't them getting kicked off.
