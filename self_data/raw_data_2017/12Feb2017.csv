3,"So, my family and I are thinking of adopting a cat. We went to a local pet shop that has three kittens waiting to be adopted. One of them has only one eye. Perfectly happy and meowing ball of fur, but blind of an eye. It looks like a bigger cat wolverined him in the face.

We don't know if we're actually going to be able to afford a cat right now. What scares me is, I know that this particular cat has a smaller chance of getting adopted, due to his appearence. I want to take him in, but I'm the only one, and this is something that the whole family should agree.

If he doesn't get adopted.. what happens to him? He is still a small cat, not newborn, but maybe it has two months. They wouldn't put him down just because he didn't find a home, right? I swear I'd take him in a blink, but I just can't right now and I'm worried about what they might do to him.",12Feb2017,2
5,"What is success anyway... 

I've lived my life being pressured by my father into being successful. Having a career, making money and achieving highly. Following in what he thinks are his footsteps, not making any of the same mistakes he did. 

I believed this. For 25 years of my life I believed that success was what my father pushed me in to. 

His ideas of success pushed me into making many major mistakes in my life. Mistakes I could have learned from if I wasn't chasing his pressurised dream for me. 

I lost my career at an early stage of my life thought being a scapegoat for management. Instead of support, all I got from him was an earful that I hadn't tried hard enough at my career, that I hadn't shown the company enough dive and determination and that I didn't fight my battles. 

I lost my long term SO through a variety of factors. Factors which could have been avoided if I didn't follow my father's idea of success.
I remember telling my SO that I had ambition to be successful, to have a great career, achieve and make money. 
But that didn't matter when we were together because the greatest happiness I ever had was buying a ring to ask her to marry me. It didn't matter to her if I had a career, money or achieved. What mattered was love. 

We broke up before I asked her. (The full story is in a different post) 

I told my father today that I am suffering from depression following on from losing my job, my love, losing grasp of my future and that my only choice was to return to my mother's house back in a poor region of the UK. But somewhere I can rebuild my life and happiness. 

His response was short, angry and unforgiving. 'You are being an idiot, going back there is the end for you, what are you going to do in 5 years when you're living off your mother's sofa, claiming benefits and being a burden to society. You're pissing away all the money I spent sending you to university to get your MSc. You have to stay where you are and be successful, even if you are a little sad, you fucked up your life, relationship and career being lazy and having everything given to you'. 

For the first time in my life it hit me. He wants me to be successful, I want to be successful. But our definitions are completely the opposite. 

I want happiness, love and a family

He wants me to have a career, money and achieve. 

I calmly explained my ideas of success to him. He got angry. He's threatened to never give me anything anymore if I make the move back to my mother's. I simply replied that would be fine by me. 

For the first time since I've lost it all I feel happy, releaved, a weight off my shoulders. From now on I will be working towards my success, not his. 

I wish I had known this sooner, known to chase my own success and not the pressurised success I was being forced into. 

So, what is success anyway? 

Success is what you want, what you want to achieve, what makes you happy. 

Good luck Reddit and I hope you find success.  




Edit: suppose I better add a TL;DR, I didn't think the post would be as long. 

TL;DR - success is your definition, not anyone's elses. Don't chase their dreams, chase your own.

7,"I've never talked to anyone before about this issue, because I have a lot of shame (more on that later) so while I will absolutely be looking for advice, just the catharsis of getting this out there is nice.

I'll have to start at the beginning, so strap in. I don't come from a very ""open"" family, at least as far as sex goes. I don't remember ever having a ""talk,"" to be honest. My parents did tell me that they'd answer any questions I had, but I was a shy 12 year old, and so I was at once unlikely to approach them with questions and unlikely to even know what to ask. Naturally, around this time I started to become more sexually aware. My first memory of an attempt at masturbation involved me holding a playboy magazine in front of me as I (not knowing at all what to do) poked at the pinup girl with my flaccid penis (I find it really funny now, but it does illustrate my confusion at the time.) I vaguely remember wanting ""sex,"" but not knowing at all what that was. This came to a head when my dad found several porn sites in his search history. After a brief talk it became very clear to him that I had no clue what I was doing, and so he gave me a book on human sexuality, one that his dad had given him when he was a kid. I can't say I ever read it, even to this day. (Can you blame me? The thing's a freaking textbook, what 12 year old would bother?)

Fast-forward a bit. I'm up late one night, everyone's out of the house, and I'm watching a pornographic show on the tv. I start vaguely touching myself for what felt like a long time until - suddenly - I have my first orgasm. Took me completely by surprise. To be honest, I don't think anyone had explained to me what an orgasm was before. I was so astounded by this that my first reaction was to tell my best friend, Jake, all about it. He was unimpressed, basically told me ""yeah, that's what's supposed to happen when you do that."" He also introduced me to the ""stroking"" motion, for whatever that's worth.

The fallout from this experience was that I started masturbating like CRAZY. I'd say an average day was at least 3 times, and there were days when it went up to 7 or 8. I'd also do it basically anywhere. Restrooms, in my bed, sitting next to my parent's bed, anywhere that I felt was ""private"" enough. I even remember masturbating to a scene in American Dad, in full view of Jake, only covered by a blanket (I swear, in my head I felt like I was hiding it.) Obviously, this got to be a problem. I masturbated every morning when I woke up, and eventually one time my mom caught me. She asked me if I could get up and give her a hug. Seeing as I was still erect and had no pants on, I said the only thing I could think of, ""no."" A week later my brother (5 years older than me, so about 18?) comes into my room in the morning, says that mom asked him to talk to me. The conversation amounted to this: 
Him: ""Adam, how much have you been masturbating?"" 
Me: ""...A lot..."" 
Him: ""How often?"" 
Me: ""Like... 3 or 4 times a day.""
Him: ""It's cool man, but you gotta cut down on it.""
As I hope I illustrated, lots of shame, not much open communication as to WHY I was doing it. And perhaps unsurprisingly, this didn't cut down on how often I did it, just how careful I was about hiding it.

Eventually, I graduated from using the TV to using the internet. I may as well have been cracking open pandora's box with an icepick. Naturally I found lots of porn, but eventually I found something that I liked better: a chat website, called Omegle. (For those unfamiliar, it connects you with an anonymous stranger, and you can disconnect at any point.) This may sound silly, but I've always been a very literary person, so going from looking at still images and watching videos to interacting with another human being... Well it might as well have been a world of difference. Thing is, I found out quickly that lonely, self-conscious teenage boys didn't often get the time of day on Omegle, so eventually I started pretending to be a girl.

I'd like to stop the story here to assert that I have no issue with my gender identity. I am very much a straight, cisgendered male. I think my reasons for playing a girl were numerous; people actually talked to girls on Omegle, and with the right prodding I could get the guy to talk to me the way that I wanted him to. I wouldn't (and still don't) imagine myself in the girl's place, but in the guy's. Honestly, these chats (and there have been hundreds, maybe thousands) never amounted to much, and they're almost universally ridiculous. You'd be surprised how many people have six-packs, 10 inch dicks, and can keep going nonstop for 4 hours straight. Frankly, when I'm masturbating, this stuff, dumb as it is, just melts away and I still feel turned on by it.

However, I ran into another problem, and now we finally get to the title. People on any chat site are, as I'm sure you know, VERY pushy when it comes to pictures. Eventually, in order to appease them, I started finding random pictures of cute girls online and pasting those to the chat. By and large, they would buy it, and eventually I started feeling like it actually enhanced the experience for me. I especially would feel good when they'd compliment my (the girl's) body. It's gotten to the point where I go out of my way to ask them what they like about it. Not to get too armchair psychologist here, but I feel like that stems from insecurities about my own body. Anyway: Eventually I started getting bored of random pictures on the internet, and I started taking pictures from girls I knew on Facebook, even girls who were close friends, and using those. I won't lie, I have some cute friends, and I've had crushes on more than a few, and I feel like this activity just muddles all of those feelings. (Not to mention that I feel like it's incredibly disrespectful to those girls, even dangerous.)

And that's the situation I find myself in today. I've talked to a therapist about how much I masturbate, which helped me cut down. I have not, however, discussed this history of masturbation, nor this particular method, with anyone. I feel like I ABSOLUTELY can't talk to my female friends about it, even if I didn't use their pictures. I'd just be giving them reason to see me as some creep. I also feel like I can't talk to my male friends, because by and large they know my female friends, and I don't want to constantly feel like I'm being judged. I'm feeling more and more that I want to bring this up with my parents (they're divorced now, so I might want to do it one at a time.) However I'm not sure if I want to talk to them about some problems I have with how they treated my sexuality growing up, or tell them specifically what I'm doing today. I feel like it might be tmi, but then I've literally never talked to anyone, and I feel a lot of shame and guilt about this.

I feel like I grew up having to figure out a lot of this on my own, and it led to me feeling insecure and ashamed of my body and my sexual desires. Even today I get very uncomfortable when people bring up sex. That could possibly be because I'm a virgin, but I have to imagine there are virgins who are fine talking about sex, and I refuse to believe that having sex is some magical cure that'll make me comfortable with it. At the end of the day, I'm tired of feeling like a virginal weirdo, especially because I'm a rather well-adjusted person otherwise (I'm great at parties until everyone starts getting a bit more sexually frank.) I'm also tired of this masturbation habit I have. It takes literal hours, which is time I could be spending doing literally anything else, and oftentimes I do it out of habit, not because it feels good. Plus, it only adds to that perception of myself as a closet pervert and a shameful person.

My questions are: 1. Should I talk to my parents about this? When/if I talk to them, should I bring up specifically what I do with the chat site, or just keep it at the grievances I have with my sexual education? 
2. How can I start to feel more comfortable with sexual talk and sexual situations? I have lots of female friends but I don't think any of them see me as anything more than a friend precisely because I'm afraid to express myself as a sexual being. 
3. How do I deal with the guilt and shame I feel over what I've done? I really do feel awful for having used pictures of my friends for so many years in order to get off, but I can't imagine ever talking to any of them about it. Do I need to in order to feel better?

tl;dr: I use pictures of my friends and claim to be them on a chat site in order to talk to other guys and masturbate. I think this stems from a sexually repressed upbringing, and I want to figure out who I should talk to about this, how to stop feeling so awful about this, and how to deal with sexual situations in life more frankly and with more confidence.

I make people laugh and smile. I'm not shy or unresponsive. I'm almost always the one to initiate conversation. 



I am always the one to text someone or snapchat someone first. The only reason people even respond is because of this streak thing on snapchat. 



I always get the feeling that the only reason people talk to me is because they pity me or don't want to flat out reject me.

This whole 'wholesomememes' thing is ridiculous. Do you know what only ever being 'positive' does? It makes every opinion you give meaningless. You may as well not speak. You might as well always be negative. They are the same thing. You aren't transferring any information in relation to positivity of compassion of heart.

Anyone who actually considers your personality at any level will realise this fact. You will add a lot less to these people's lives than you would by simply being a kind and honest person.

Jesus was not always 'wholesome'. Zen masters were not always 'wholesome'. This entire trend makes no logical sense and it feels extraordinarily weird to look through the comment sections on this subreddit. Like a bunch of non-humans. And that's effectively what you are - you have very little true impact on the outside world. A cult.

Wholesemememes is meant to promote health and well-being. I see little evidence of it doing so, in terms of net effect - unless you include adverse effect.

Wholesomememes is meant to be devoid of corruption. However the users of this form are undeniably dishonest in their conduct. This is a form of corruption. - As an aside, the world wholesome itself is being corrupted.

Wholesomememes is meant to be conducive to genuine friendship. You could not possibly call the friendships that develop here genuine.

Wholesomememes is meant to display genuine human emotion.

I almost feel my mental gears grind as I think about it.  I have a mental illness.  I should just go somewhere outside of society and be.  I accept the reality that my entire existence is irrelevant to most, and will be, no matter what I do.  Those few people in my life that I know consider me of value enough that my death would be traumatic-I don't spend enough time with as they tell me all the details of their lives which I lose track of and quickly find the entire interaction overwhelming.


They say when you die, you face heaven or he'll or karmic retribution or simply some cosmic knowledge that your life was a et positive or negative.  I don't know.  I don't know that my current life is positive or negative or neutral in comparison to others, but it involves things I don't want to do so I consider it to be hell.

If God exists, He's a bastard for not having a chat line where we could just discuss things and get some kind of truly objective view.  How am I supposed to understand what is right or wrong or good or evil with this subjective view?

Socrates said that the pursuit of knowledge was a central part of the desirable good life.  Fuck that.  I know plenty.  I have a pretty good processor in my head and storage for days.  Knowledge hasn't done much for me, as I have no tangible evidence I have it.  Money may not be the key to happiness, but having money certainly allows more time and energy to go into pursuing it.

Then again, the time spent earning the money is time spent securing means with which to pursue happiness, instead of actively pursuing it.

Of course, what is happiness?  Is it just another concept we have to describe some reason to get up in the morning, consider whether death is better, go to work....

32,"I'm 26 and have never been in a relationship. I'm a very shy and reserved person and don't go out much, but with the turn of the new year, I felt I needed a change in my life. I decided that I would at least put myself out there, trying a bunch of different dating apps and sites.

After a couple weeks without any results, I was matched with a cute guy on Tinder. After a few days of chatting, we decided to meet up. We went out for pho, walked around talking, and eventually got ice cream. I really loved it. Even though it was my first date ever, I don't remember feeling nervous. He was such a nice guy and made me feel comfortable almost immediately. While we were walking around, I told him that it was my first date and he was incredibly understanding. We set up a movie date for a few days later.

The night before our second date, he asked me to come over to his apartment to cuddle. I feel like I probably should have declined and gotten to know him a bit better, but I threw caution to the wind. We cuddled on his couch watching Netflix before we moved to his bed to go to sleep. I probably should have left at this point, but I enjoyed his company. We were talking about random things when he crawled over and kissed me.

We started making out and fondling each other. Even though it was exciting and felt really good, I didn't seem to enjoy it as much as I thought I would. I don't know if I had high expectations or if I needed something more than just sex. We ended up cuddling for a bit before I decided to head home. He apologized afterwards, but it was really both our fault for moving too fast. While it may not have been very special, I don't regret what happened.

Even though I felt unsure about him, I decided to go on our movie date anyways. We held hands throughout the film, even though I'm not all that comfortable/used to PDA. I enjoyed it, but afterwards, I was still confused, and decided that we'd probably be better off friends. But after thinking over the weekend, I had a change of heart and decided to give him another chance. We ended up texting every day for about a week.

After resetting everything, things felt really good until last night when he asked to come over. He told me that he wanted to give his ex, who had ""given up"" on him, a second chance and that we should just be friends. Even though that's how I felt a week ago, I had a change of heart and now I feel really bummed out. I was starting to get to know him better, and felt like something more could have happened. I'd still like to be friends with him, but it might be a while before that happens.

And since I haven't had a job yet and everyone asked me about how it went with the interviews, and while I did not think I would get the job, I blindly said ""Yes"" to the job offer without really thinking it hardly through. - My friends and Family is happy &amp; proud over me. But the thing is that now when I know that I'm going to work at this place I realize that it's really not my thing at all and I'm not happy at all over the job and i really regret saying yes for it. 

I'm having panic attacks over this since I'm not quite a strong person mentally and I'm also having anxiety over this. A huge part of me just wants to call the employer and tell him sorry and that I have to withdraw my ""yes"" for the job (it has not started yet and no contract has been signed)
But my family is cheering for me over this in such way as in happy over this and I really don't want to disappoint them, but I also don't want to force myself to do a job I don't want to do. 

Should i call and say that I'm sorry for thanking yes earlier and that I can't start at the work and then make up an excuse to say to my family and friends (because i really don't want to just say that I didn't like the job and neither tell the truth that I'm having panic attacks over the facts about what the service is)

I really want to continue with my internship while looking for a job that really will fit me and that I will look forward to starting. Please give me your thoughts on this.. I'm sorry, also my grammar might not be the best but I hope I made sense. Thanks.

42,"I don't know why I'm bothering making this post, probably mostly because I'm bored or have nothing better to do. For the past few years I've been thinking I've probably got depression, although I've not actually told anyone about it or been diagnosed or anything. I've thought about suicide, but I'd never actually do it, just thought about it. I'd be happy if I just died in my sleep or something, but I'd never actually kill myself. I know a few people who have gotten cancer before, and I've always thought 'why couldn't it be me?' It probably sounds retarded to say I wish I had a terminal disease, but I don't know, it's just how I feel. 

I've always thought I had depression because I showed a lot of symptoms. I only ever showered when I had to, only ever did anything when I absolutely had to, really. Went through school and then sixth form just winging it, coming out at the end with mediocre (at best) grades. Never did any work. Never really had a proper social life (I'm 18 now). Never had a girlfriend. Funny because I'm attractive, I know I am, and I even had plenty of chances to have a girlfriend but I'm lazy as fuck. That's what I've always said anyway, I'm pretty sure in reality I've just got depression. I never did anything except be lazy. Since I finished sixth form last year I've not done anything. Don't have a job, nothing. I just go out now and then. Sleep 12 or more hours a day, struggle to wake up in the morning, zero motivation. It's funny, writing it down here makes it seem really bad, but in reality I'm very good at winging it. Nobody thinks I'm depressed as far as I know. I'm not entirely sure I do, since I've never been diagnosed. If you met me you'd just think I'm a normal guy. Funny, good looking, searching for a job or a uni course I'd be interested in, trying to figure out what I want to do in life. As if I want to do anything. 

I don't even know why I'm writing this to be honest. Well actually I do. My dog, which I've had since I was a little kid, as far as I can remember, is dying. It looks like he's gonna have to be put down, we have to go to the vets soon and find out. My parents have been crying, my brother has cried, but me? Nothing. It's happened before too, I've lost a couple of family members in my life, but I never cared. I made excuses for it like oh well I didn't see them enough to want to cry or whatever, but I saw them just as much as my brother did and he still cried. I remember being sat in a funeral surrounded by my crying family just expressionless, like a fucking So I Googled it. Why the fuck do I never cry? What the fuck is wrong with me? I love my dog. And there it was again- depression. This time I found something that sounded even more like me though, melancholic depression. I'm pretty damn sure that's exactly what's wrong with me. 

I don't really know why I'm making this post to be honest. Maybe I'm just bored of being such a fucking waste. Not like writing a load of shit on reddit to people I don't know is going to change that, lol. I don't know. I really don't know. I've actually made posts like this before but they just got ignored. A few times. 

If I can't fucking feel anything, how am I supposed to decide what the fuck am I going to do with my life. ",12Feb2017,3
43,"I made a post here several days ago about how I can't find anyone since I'm a shut-in, and I was told that online dating is a good idea.

I've tried tinder once with no luck, mostly because I didn't see many on there who are the sort of person I'm interested in (also a shut in).

The other reasons are that I keep hoping I'll find someone in real life even if it's super unlikely. I go to uni, but most of my classes have a handful of women at most and the only ones I've been interested in at all have already rejected me for various reasons (mostly already having a bf, no hard feelings).

The last thing that's holding me back is that I'm fairly young, and it seems like online dating doesn't really hold many options until you hit late twenties or so, is it worth my time if I'm under the age of 22 or so?

I'm not really in a rush, but as of now, the only thing I really want is a relationship. I've already found myself a small friend group, more hobbies than a person should have, and I enjoy my classes.",12Feb2017,3
44,"Its Sunday morning and I have one goal today, clean my apartment.  Laundry day so clothes are limited so I throw on my 10 year old high school hoodie and some gym shorts.  Throw on my comfy shoes, may have a hole or two...  I get in my car go to the dollar store to pick up some cleaning supplies.  Grab it all go to the cashier with a smile and open with ""hello how are you doing today"" and get the average response.  Pay. Walk away.  

Overhear the cashier say to a coworker ""He looked really lonely,""  BEFORE I was even out of the store.  Now for me, I don't really care what the cashier at a dollar store thinks but it struck a nerve for a few reasons.  Why?  Because I have struggled with depression on and off for years now and if I didn't have a beautiful girlfriend to go home to right before Valentines Day it's those kind of words that would send me into an anxiety breakdown of loneliness.  

I've worked in customer service my whole life and I know its hard not to talk about customers but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE wait until they are gone.  A simple misconception could lead to ruining someones day, week, or even life (bit dramatic but if things are bad all it takes is one small thing to tip the scale).

**TLDR- Don't talk about customers until customers are gone because you don't know what they are going through.**

I'm really tired of people blaming immigrants illegal or not for every problem. I'm really tired of people blaming the media for everything or the democrats or republicans... no one seems to talk about helping people with problems.

48,"I'm just feel so bad that I wanted it to write it...

I moved continents 3 weeks ago, 2 weeks ago I met a really cute girl who invited me somewhere past weekend. I invited a friend and they seemed to be into each other, so I just thought ""shit happens"" and tried to move on. We went back together since we live close and it seemed like she was trying to kiss me, so I tried it and she said no, that it was not ok and it would just make things worse.

Sunday morning she texted me that it was not ok to try to kiss her since she only sees me as a friend, I just thought it was obvious so while I felt a bit bad I didn't pay that much of attention. But we continued talking and she invited me to her place because she didn't want to go out since she was feeling sick. At the end we had an amazing time, I felt she was perfect, my same musical taste, same future plans, she does the same things as me... I mean, she couldn't be more perfect.

Since I was feeling hangover I was laying on her bed and she was hugging me, kissing my cheeks, my arms, etc. and after hours that felt like minutes I told her I had to go but first I needed to ask her what the fuck was going on, since that's not how you treat a friend. She said she was just feeling a lot of things and that she just felt so comfortable with me, like we knew each other for years (which I think it's true since I felt the same).

Then we saw each other Monday and Tuesday after work, we couldn't stop messaging each other, she started telling me how happy she was to found me and how perfect it was the we started seeing each other, both of these days she was always kissing me around my face and when it looked like she was about to kiss me she just kissed anywhere else, things like that, but for some reason she look conflicted every time.

Then Wednesday arrived... I went to her place again, and things as usual, telling me how much she loves my eyes, my smell, my skin, and we finally kissed... For a minute. Then she said how it was wrong because she only sees me as a friend, whatever, I got a big angry and started ignoring her just playing with my phone, then she started going from side to side to her room, looking really angry to herself or something, shouting things in her native language (which I don't speak) and then started passionated kissing each other.

After some minutes she just tells me how hard it was for her not to kiss all the previous days, that she wanted it to do it so bad but she just feel like she couldn't. Then things continued, I took her clothes off, she invited me to shower with her and then sex.

The next day she just messages me that she felt in heaven with me, and that she loved everything about me, but that it was really wrong, that she was sorry about doing it because it was just wrong. But she said she didn't want to lose me and wanted to see me every day. I thought it was weird so I went to her place before work, we talked a little, kissed more (ugh, I know), and then agreed either to stop talking to each other or see each other as friends only. I told her I didn't want to see her then since I would never be able to see her as nothing more, she said it was unfair because she did want to see me again, but it became late and we had to go so we agreed to talk later.

We continued messaging each other, I asked her if I could go to her place that afternoon and she said she had something to do but we could meet on Friday, then I joked about it and she stopped answering...

So, since I don't really want to get into details, I just started going crazy, since I had no idea what was going on, tried to see her but she didn't want to and we already had the plan to meet with my friend (the one that appeared to be into her the first night), I told him I needed to talk to him about it and she said she was seeing her since Thursday night, and that he was planning on seeing her after work, I told him what happened the previous days and I just told him that it was ok if he choose to be with her, I've done some shitty things too, so that it is up to him to go for her or not. Just that if he chose her then I just wouldn't be close to him anymore, not because of jealously, but because I really liked that girl and it would be awkward.

So we agreed I should talk to her first, which I did and I caught her after work. It was so hard, I was so angry because of what she did, but I was also feeling so sad because I really thought she was so close to be my ""perfect girl"", and she was actually an amazing friend (outside of all of this), so I just feel so bad... When I asked her why she did all those things with me and then with him she just said ""Because at first I knew I wasn't so sure about being with you, and I had an amazing time and was still unsure, and now that I saw him I know for sure he is the one I want"".

I felt so bad... But well, that's life.

Funnily enough, that phrase looks being taken out of 500 days of summer or something, and I always seem to end up in relationships exactly like her. I don't know if I'm only attracted to Summers, or if Summers become it when they meet me...

I don't know, but if anyone read the whole story, thank you for reading, at least I hope it was entertaining, I know I might be wrong since the beginning and should've backed off, but I really liked her... But I know I was stupid, maybe she was playing, maybe she wasn't, maybe she was just looking for attention or maybe she was for real. And we will never know.

So, I'm not only heartbroken because of her, I also lost my friend, and just having this idea on my mind on how she will treat him the same way she treated hurts a lot...",12Feb2017,2

52,"**EDIT: I found her! Posted this to Facebook and a friend saw another friends comment on a post made by a lady who runs a rescue. The girl who saved him contacted her about the dog. Unfortunately she wasn't able to keep him and he's already at a shelter **

**if anyone knows a better place for this post please let me know**


I was the girl in the red car who pulled over in front of you. I thought for sure I was about to see that little guy get crushed in front of my eyes. You looked as bewildered as I was once you caught him, I'd like to help you if you can't find a place to keep him. I hope you and the dog you saved are ok. Oh and a big old thanks for nothing to the CHP officer who watched all this happen, but didn't stop to help the three of us who were nearly killed prior to pulling over, all the people who almost wrecked as well as the dog. I  hope you had somewhere really important to be since you apparently ignored the immediate life threatening event taking place in front of you. 

**edit** 

Since I've been getting comments telling me I'm stupid, irresponsible, cocky, am not trained in public safety and that I'm ""bashing this cop all over the internet"" I'd like to include a few photos along with a list of my training and certs.

This  https://imgur.com/a/SUwig  is a photo of the spot where we pulled over. You can clearly see it was a fairly large (now grassy) area in which cars can stop during emergencies. This was an emergency. I've also included a picture of the dog (from the rescue who is keeping him now) since someone told me the dog could have been dangerous and aggressive (btw a dangerous and aggressive dog, believe it or not, is also an emergency)

Now here is a list of my training.You'll see that I've had extensive training in public safety, policing and emergency medicine.

Police Academy at the age of 21. OPOTA certified, reserve officer for almost 3 yrs while I attended college and received my degree in administration of justice/criminology. Moved to a new state where I became an EMT, and was required (once again)to complete EVOC training, that's Emergency Vehicle Operation training btw. Worked as a 911 EMT until I passed Paramedic school. I'm currently employed as an emergency room technician as well as a 911 medic in an ambulance. I rarely drive the ambulance anymore but it's practically all I did as an EMT. we respond to calls everywhere, busy freeways included. I'm trained to evaluate scene safety as a priority in literally every single one of these jobs.

How anyone who wasn't there when this happened and doesn't know my level of training can presume to know how safe or unsafe the situation was is beyond me.

I wanted to be a cop my whole life, I went to school for it and volunteered for 3 yrs, unpaid, as a reserve to prepare myself. Unfortunately, I was injured outside of work and was unable to work once I moved to CA, not sure I'd have been hired here anyways as standards are much higher. Instead I went in to EMS where I work with the police on a daily basis. I have nothing but respect and admiration for police officers and I understand the risks they take every day, in fact, my best friend was killed in the line of duty which is what inspired me to enter the public safety field to begin with. 

I do not appreciate anyone making sweeping judgements of my training, level of intelligence or stance on the state of policing in this country. I know what I did could have been dangerous but in my opinion, the dog on the freeway was a much bigger threat to everyone's safety, which I why I felt I should act. I find it especially amusing that some of you have said what I did was incredibly dangerous whilst in the same sentence, defending the officers choice to not act in any way (as I've said multiple times, THAT I KNOW OF). how you can point out how illegal and reckless I was acting while saying the cop had no duty to act, I'll never understand. 

I apologize for the rant but this is the one thing about reddit I can't stand. You know essentially nothing about the strangers here and yet somehow you are able to definitively speak about charactor/intelligence/training. What a talent!

So, with all due respect, please do not lecture when you don't know who your audience is. 
  

Edit: well it seems that those if you still commenting have either not read anything I've written, or just flat out refuse to acknowledge anything I've had to say. I'm not sure why everyone seems to be ignoring the part where I've admitted that what I did was dangerous. I made a judgement call, I stand by it, nobody got hurt, there were no accidents and the dog wasn't kiled. There isn't much more I can tell you. I'm guessing you all agree that the police officer should have intervened, what with how dangerous and illegal what I did right in front of him was....

I feel like I'm talking to a wall at this point so I'll leave it at that. I accomplished what I wanted to accomplish with this post, I found the girl. unfortunately it was too late and the dog was already taken to a shelter where he is likely to go unadopted.Thanks for the help! ",12Feb2017,486

60,"I(M16/17) met Melody(F19/20) from work around November, and she has just turned 19 at the end of October. She had a girlfriend at the time, and had dated her for four years, but it started going sour sometime in the first year, but it would be too much of a change to break up. She never had a mother, and only an abusive stepmom, and a druggy father, who besides the drugs, was a great man, and the father I never had. I talked to her a bunch after she introduced herself one day, and we really hit it off. Her girlfriend, Taylor, didn't really like her talking to me, because she thought she would lose her, and she was right to think that, because Melody was becoming attracted to me. We talked for about a month, and hung out when we could, but we would have to sneak around Taylor and she would have to delete texts of us planning to hang out. Within that month, I had made a few sexual moves, and she wanted them, but she had a girlfriend, and she didn't let it go too far because of that. 

One day, at my school, we grinded on each other in the teacher parking lot, and it was great, but afterwards she said it was a mistake and she is hurting both me, and Taylor. I was a horny teenager, but I did my best to understand, so from then on, I was just a friend who was there to help her through her problems, and she told me her problems, and I gladly talked her through them. Fast Forward to January 8th, 2016. She texted me and asked if she could come over, and I said ""Of course"", and she was on her way. We went into my room and watched a movie. I tried to make a move and move my hand from her shoulders onto her chest. I continued to do that for a few minutes and  moved down to her vagina and fingered her. We did some foreplay, and when it came to intercourse, she was scared at first, but I coaxed her into it. After all that, it was 11:54 PM, and she said I love you back to me for the first time. In that month before, I had said it twice, but she never said it back. 

She said she would break up with Taylor soon, but Taylor was a different story. She was emotional and depressed, so she wouldn't take it well at all, which made Melody rightfully nervous. One day she finally did it, and we were officially a couple, and everyone at work had already found out. There are many things that happened in between, good and bad, (mostly good), but we'll skip to the major turning points. 

Fast forward to month 8, to where I decided to have two jobs. One at Food City, and one at Subway. I hated working in food, but I took so much work and time to get the job, I tried to like it the best I could, but that job made me so stressed out and miserable, and I brought it home. 

Fast forward to November 11th, 2016, to where Melody tried to break up with me, but I broke down and wouldn't let her go, and even proposed suicide, pushing her into a corner, making her have to say yes. She had been hanging out with Jacob, from work, and they played Xbox together quite often, and enjoyed playing together. She didn't want to be in this relationship, so on November 14th, 2016, I saw she was sad at work, and asked her what was wrong, and she said it would make me sad. Regardless, I asked her to tell me what was bothering her after work, and she did. The break up took about thirty minutes, but then she was gone. 

I didn't know what to do, and everything was so different. It was my first serious relationship. All my other ones had no end goals, but I had planned on living with this woman, and marrying her one day, but then the path I had paved out for myself had crumbled before me. We had agreed to be friends, but they all say that. I texted her the next day, but I had later found out I texted her too much, so I had a limit on how much I could talk to her. I had also later found out she laid in a bed with Jacob on November 12th, but I don't blame her with how I talked about suicide. Fast forward a month, and I love her, but I'm also sad and lonely. In all that, I ended up calling her a bitch and that she was sarcastic and moody, and whether it was true or not, she didn't deserve to hear that, and the same things goes for the suicide. I was an emotional and horny teenager, but in two months time, I learned how to control my emotions and be truly independent, and happy alone.

Tldr: I met a girl from work and dated her for 10 months, but I let my emotions control me and pushed her away when she loved me.",12Feb2017,1
