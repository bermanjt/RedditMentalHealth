2,"In a few months, I will be married. That's a tad bit scary. 

I'm marrying the girl of my dreams and cannot wait to call her wife and the honeymoon sex. But, as I sit on a train, I can't help but re-think of my previous relationships. I've learned so much from them--what to say, what not to say. And now, I want to share the experiences.


I'm not flaunting my relationships, I'm just hoping that this may help someone find out who is the one for them.

#1. The High School Friend.

Everyone has that fling in high school. Its not serious, you have no clue what a relationship is, you might not even realize you are in a relationship. 


I met this girl in a sophomore year science class. I was partnered with the high school hunk and I guy who I used to call friend.


*I'm still cool with the guy. If I saw him at a bar, I'd probably buy him a drink and catch up. But it is just one of those lab partner friendships. You catch up on life, see how things are, occasionally talk about the new hot chick in class. But other than that, not much*


All of the girls would flirt with him. And, as cheesy as it sounds, he always knew what to say, knew what to do. I would always be amazed when we would hang out after class and he was talking up a junior or senior girl. The dude had game. 


He was also a great wingman. 

I wasn't good at reading signs, but then again, is any guy good at reading signs? 

Girlfriend #1 was a strong package. Slightly athletic, very smart and had a decent sense of humor. Every single movie about high school told me that she was a great girl. Somewhat attractive, she had a great smile and I always admired it about her.

My wingman would always talk me up, saying how cool I was or how I was quality boyfriend material. I didn't know why, I never knew she liked me. That was until she made the move and asked me out. And all was great.


The thing about high school relationships is that you have no clue what they mean or how they work. All I knew at the time was that she was my girlfriend and I had a phone number. I also never told my parents about this girl, which to this day I'm still baffled as to how it was kept secret. My family never knew her. My sisters never knew her. 


We did the typical high school couple things. Held hands in the hallway, went to the football games. We would sometimes go on ""dates"" where we'd stop at a high school hangout spot with four other people. It never felt personal.


Another thing about high school relationships is how quickly they end. It was less than three weeks into the relationship when I realized it was over. Homecoming voting was about to being and people were quick to toss out nominations, based on all of the couples. I never thought much of them, I would always vote for the signature high school sweethearts, who actually stayed together and got married after college. 


And then my name was thrown in the hat. 


Its weird how when people begin to notice your relationship, you re-think everything. What about the relationship is great? What do people see in it? What do you see in it? 


I couldn't get that out of my head. And when I drove her home from school on a Friday, I ended the relationship with the signature, ""its not you, its me. Lets be friends."" That never works. There is always an awkward tension, even if the romance was meaningless. You can never just be friends. 

...

You learn a lot in your first relationship but it rarely lasts. You are eager to build a connection but the first one is never the right one. You being to understand what you are interested, what qualities you like, who you are into. ",08Sep2017,7

10,I'm talking to a girl recently and I really like her. Yesterday I found out that she cheated on her boyfriend (dude a) with dude b and had sex with dude c at the same time.

11,"I know everyone will say of course it's not. If there is any response to this thread I'm sure I'll read some stories about a 50 year old man who changed everything about his life.

Unfortunately I'm not talking about some kind of fundamental environment change, I'm not looking to white knuckle my way through hurting the people who love me and moving to Alaska without warning. I'm looking to fix a problem that seems to get worse with every step I take down the paths that I chose to walk down.

If I may indulge, I'd like to back up.

I'm 23, I make great money, just bought a house near Seattle, it's on an island and I have 4 acres. I can drive my jeep around my over grown property and winch things up trees when I'm bored. I've captured so much of what I would have dreamed of when I was younger. Friends come over and we play D&amp;D on my dining room table. I have an upstairs office and sometimes when my girlfriend (who I live with) is gone, I'll drink scotch and smoke a cigarette while sitting most way out the window off the upstairs hallway. Sometimes some little critters will be making noise on my trees so I'll lean back and grab an airsoft gun and fire tons of plastic BBs harmlessly in the trees and scare them off.
I travel some for work and when I'm not traveling I'm working from home, managing newer employees and making sure they are set up for success.

In many ways I love my life, I love my friends, I don't love my job, but I like what it lets me do. 

I apologize for doing what I'm sure will be seen as either bragging, or just some blatant narcissism, but I don't see any way around it. I have a very romantic attachment to many of the moments in my life, and I've been extremely fortunate to get where I am.

But now I'm looking around and seeing so many things I missed along the way. I never got to be popular as an adult, I missed crazy parties, I missed getting a job that was my whole life, I never moved far from my home town, I never went to college, I haven't had that crazy instant intimacy with a girl in 6 years, the last one I had was with my current girlfriend of 6 years.

I never learned how to work hard, I never spent a week working with a single minded intensity on my music, I never got to make films, I never got to get good at writing. I never learned how to network, I never proved I was smart, I never got over my insecurities....

I realized when I was in high school that life was a series of doors closing. But I'm not sure I can handle that... There is so much more life has to offer, and I can't stand that I'm not out there living them... but the choices I've made, I've made so deliberately. I'm proud of where I am, I love my 4 friends and my girlfriend, my dad comes over on a lot of weekends and helps me work on the house, I chose my life and I've always been good at standing by my choices.

I've always been a melancholy person, I've liked that about myself, but I use to think that I might be able to turn it into amazing music, instead I ended up with an amazing life. What does life have to offer now? What, aside from kids, can I do? Am I done growing? Am I done?

I'm in a hotel room in Alaska atm, the flight gives me free drinks so I'm a bit..... drinky, but this isn't a new though, these fears are not manifestations of the drink, or the latitude, these fears have been with me my whole life, and every time I think I've fixed them, I retroactively redefine my fears to include the choice I have made, ostensibly to resolve those fears.

Anyone else know what I'm talking about? Any help?",08Sep2017,2

I'm seeing her therapist, and my first appointment was about 2 months ago.

I don't know what's happening, up until recently I was a /r/foreveralone, now I'm not, suddenly everything is fucking changing before my eyes.

For the first time ever, I'm not just one person, I'm two people. She's like an extension of me, and I'm an extension of her. I don't always understand it, but there's no turning back.

A year ago this time I was probably getting drunk by myself and cutting my wrists as some sort of silent cry for help to the world. Tonight, I'm getting drunk just because I can't see her for another 16 hours, and I'm bored. Spending time with myself can be nice, I've learned, but it's boring in comparison to spending it with her.

It's only been on the market for a week and already there's two showings booked so I'll probably have to deal with this a lot over the next month and a bit.

My roommate is disgusting. His room is disgusting. It smells really bad. The smell permeates the apartment. I have anxiety and I'm paranoid that I'll end up with a bill at the end for whatever reason. He's on the lease too but I'm the responsible one so I wouldn't be surprised if they came after me for any charges.

18,"I am wide awake writing this in a new room the hotel just put me in.

At approximately 3:30 am I woke up in my hotel room with all of my clothes on by a girl yelling at me to give her money. In all honesty, it felt like 20 years ago and my mom telling me it was time for school, while I lay groggy in my bed. 

It all happened so fast but she threatened to have someone kill me and before I knew it she was out in the hallway banging on the door. She left her phone in my room; it was on the dresser. 

I called the front desk, they sent security and then they came in and told me I was probably drugged and raped. I checked my belongings, everything was accounted for. I checked my bank statement and saw I withdrew $404 dollars from an atm around 2am. I can't find that cash. 

I have zero memory of anything past 9pm. The hotel gave the girl her phone and let her go and put me in a new room. I feel embarrassed, violated, affraid, and angry. I am not sure if we did anything and if did, then I think I could be arrested. What should I do?",08Sep2017,507

25,"I can't feel close to anyone. well there was one, but she's gone. I'm always in my head to the point of normally needing someone to repeat themselves when they start talking to me. I think about her a lot but I know she doesn't feel the same. how do you work every day? working all day sucks. I had two days off in a row for the first time in months and it's making it even harder to get out of bed. I keep waking up in panic because of the stress of having to go there. I was working to get a new car but I really feel like I'd be happier having nothing to my name but never having to ruin my day for someone else. I have nobody to talk to. you know that, why else does anyone post on self. a lot of days I wish I could die. probably every day. I don't wanna do it myself cause it will hurt my family, but I've stopped swerving out of the way when people cross the yellow lines on the road. why is she on my mind so much? my hearts still pumping fast from waking up. it's like there's always something pressing on the back of my mind. it feels like tunnel vision. sometimes it turns into physical pain and I hope it's a tumor. I haven't told anyone cause I'm really hoping for this. I miss her. I'm not sad because of her though. she just was the only one that could make me feel better. so I guess I'm just more sad because of her. not because of her. because of me. but because of her. man she was pretty too. only 3 hours and 57 minutes until I have to leave for work. I already have a knot in my stomach. I really want to be done. with everything. why am I even going to work? I don't want to. I have to. I feel dead. co workers ask me why I look like I just woke up all the time. I smile  and they say ""oh you're happy for once!"". I don't like this. I wish they would leave me alone. or just say nothing. or if they wanted to say something at least be there to listen. I have nobody to listen. they can't help me anyways so I just keep it in my head. 3 hours, 52 minutes. days short, hours long. the most accurate saying. do you guys think I'll meet her again one day and we can be together? she really is great. it won't happen. wow that made me sad, I already knew that even. it's really hard living knowing I'm going to have to put atleast 8 hours a day into someone else's pocket for the rest of my life. I'm not smart or motivated enough to work a job where I wouldn't. fuck this sucks. I think a lot how life used to feel as kid. it was great. i wish I did more as a kid. I wish I had fun and didn't care about getting in trouble. I wish I did more in high school too. maybe I'd have some friends now. instead I go to work and I come home. I'm not even making a lot of money. it's not even enough to live off of and I'm  working two jobs with a combined total for 50+ hours a week. how does everyone do it? so people actually have motivating forces? I can't help but to see people and wonder how they aren't sad. why are they happy? are they happy? if everyone just miserable? if they are I'll probably kill myself cause maybe they'll understand. probably not. if anyone want to hit me with their car for all the money in my savings account dm me.",08Sep2017,1
26,"I know reddit is technically a forum but I was just wondering if they still exist in their previous incarnation.

27,"So my roomies, three friends and I were in the living room when things started to move. At first I thought my friend was moving my chair, so I look down and his feet was not near, then I look up and the lamp was moving, then to my left and a metal thing we have to put different stuff was shaking like crazy, then I guess my friend was looking at me looking things and she screamed ""earthquake!"" then everybody stand up and we waited a few before we realised it was not stopping, then we lose power and the lights went out. 



We got out to a passage between buildings outside of our apartment, and is hard to explain but to leave our building we also have to go through another passage under our apartment with 2 doors in the way. The thing is, we leave our apartment without the keys to get out to the street and we are ""trapped"" in this narrow space and if a wall or the whole building start collapsing we are fucked. But we froze, nobody wanted to go inside for the keys, my friend is holding my arm and I'm just looking up waiting for something to fall, then someone says ""this is not stopping, is taking too long"" and there we are afraid with everything shaking amid darkness. Then after what seems like forever the earth stopped moving and the lights came back and holy shit what a relief I felt.

What I get from all this is that you really don't know how you are going to act in an emergency. While we were apparently waiting for the building to fall, I was thinking ""why the fuck I'm waiting here with them, I must get out, they are just not reacting!"" but I didn't move, I remain there with my friends, for some reasong trusting them that we were safe there when we really were not.



The news says that —so far— 30 people from other states died because of the 8.4 earthquake. Maybe some of them also froze, or didn't believe that the earthquake was something dangerous, maybe (knowing mexicans) some of them were laughing at the whole thing before a wall fell on them.


Now I'm here regretting that I didn't act for my life.",08Sep2017,7

My parents however, are immigrants from Sierra Leone, and as such, they speak the lingua franca of Sierra Leone at home, which is a language called [Krio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krio_language). Krio is descended from English and was spoken by the freed slaves who founded the Freetown Colony. It has influences from regional languages of Sierra Leone, as well as other European languages. 

I used to think it was just a dialect of English, but when I speak it to my friends, they have a lot of trouble understanding me or can't understand me at all. I don't speak Krio fluently, but I can understand it perfectly.

30,"I don't think I deserve privacy so I'm using my account. Long story short, I'm a manwhore. A disgusting, insecure and unforgivable manwhore.
Backstory: After a long series of heart breaks, being cheated on, low self esteem and feeling alone, finally, when the first long term girlfriend I *truly loved* left me out of nowhere for her own reasons, on top of family related problems, I grew very bitter. 

So, at the start of the year, I turned very promiscous, I'd mess around with boys and girls (I'm bisexual) with meaningless sex to fill the void I felt in my life. Slowly I started realising that something was wrong. Then, a month ago, it hit me, all the havoc I caused, all the friends that fought because of me, the girls and boys that cried over me, the hearts I broke. Every single memory felt like one dagger to the heart after another. I don't deserve the friends I have, and the life I have. 

I hate myself. I self harmed all my torso and part of my legs so no one can see me stripped, I stoped doing the things I love not because I don't want to but because I don't deserve to get joy out of what I do. I said sorry  and I regret all of it but it's just not enough. I don't deserve to have the privilege of changing, even if I want, and I don't deserve to have a second chance. Who am I to help people and being a good person now?

I was stupid and did all of those things without realising the damage I made, thinking that, because I said ""nothing serious"", I was never to blame. But now I'm everything I used to hate, and everyone would be better off without me.

I thought of killing myself so I couldn't hurt anyone else, but I'm too much of a coward to even do that. But the thought has growed the last weeks or so. I don't think I deserve to die, just go away of everyone I care about and that's the only way.

I don't know why I post it here or what I'm trying to accomplish, maybe I just needed to let it all out.

37,"So I'm 18, my sister 21, 2 brothers - 23 and 12. My eldest brother is studying abroad currently. 

My family situation has always been difficult, my father is a typical egotistical, self centred male, who thinks he's God's gift. He is always having a go at my mum for something or the other, totally unnecessarily. It's quite unfair on my younger brother as he's grown up for years just watching my parents fight everyday, my father's mood swings, my mother's pain and being caught in between. 

My mother always relied on us, her children, as her support when he would shout. She'd always ask us to sit with her in the same room to lessen the likelihood of my father shouting at her, as he thinks she has turned us against him to make us hate him, but this is rarely ever. Most times, he doesn't give a fuck if we're there or not, he'll give her hell regardless. 

Now, all this mental abuse has driven my mum into a mental state where she has weird episodes which seem stress induced. We are also Muslim, and although I know most of you who read this won't believe in this, but learned men in these fields have said that a jinn (search wiki if you're not sure) has attached itself to my mother - hence the reason we say she's ill. She often speaks as though she is not herself and will speak as someone else speaking to herself. The ailment that has been given to us for her shows a notable difference also. She hates it, (it is only water that has been prayed upon that we regularly refill) often she calls it poison, which I believe is whatever is inside of her speaking. 

Now a few times, my younger brother has been alone with my mother at home when she has episodes of these things taking over her. She screams, speaks as though she is not herself, and does extremely hurtful things with her hands and fist and face. As any young child would, he gets extremely terrified, and has immediately called myself and sister to come home. He is more used to it now, as much as it pains me to say it as no 12 year old should have to deal with that, but one big help for him is the fact that he knows me and my sister are there. We usually try to calm her down, are able to force her have some water, and whatever else, such as sit with her or talk to get her to stop. 

Now tomorrow, me and my sister are going on a holiday with some other family (cousins) and I am so worried about my brother and mum. I'm at a point where I don't even want to go anymore, and feel like I won't be able to enjoy myself due to fear of my dad going crazy at my mum while he has the chance due to us not being there, and then my brother being stuck alone with my mum. 

I love my mum a lot and am so grateful to her for how she's raised me under such difficult conditions, so tough and how she's stayed strong but I feel as though I'm abandoning her. I can't stop crying and I have no idea what to do.",08Sep2017,3

I learned from things that were not able to teach, but I learned; I acted on lessons that imparted no wisdom, and I was not wise; I hated myself and those that made me. When I left, I detached myself from what I was and finally started to become what I could be: stunted and false, but something I began to see. I refined myself, looked into myself, and stopped; they were all around, every tormenter, every being, and I had to learn to cope. Life can suck; people can suck; you move on to what you can want. I think it's hard, but I have the capacity to want, and I am yet to look at anything I want and consider it easy. It's hard, that's what makes it worth it. I'm happy now. I've worked hard. I am finally able to love myself, to be proud of myself, and to want myself to succeed. I am reaping the rewards, but it's been a while, and it'll likely end. But good god is it good how it is, good god is it good how it could be. But don't love god, love yourself. I'm not sure what will happen but it'll be better and I know I can cope with whatever.

44," Daydreaming is something I've done since I was a child, I would reenact scenarios in my head and play them over and over and over again with different outcomes happening and I found it so gratifying. Music and pacing are the biggest aid in my daydreaming, I'll wear headphones and pace around my room for what seems like hours just playing out different scenarios in my head, and living out different lives. I will be studying for an exam then literally go back to my fantasy world in my head, everything I know I'm not is what I created in my fantasy world. The fantasies always pertain to real life, and they differ based on what I did or who I saw that day. The reasoning for it being so intrusive is because of the fact that it distracts me from my real life and I get so involved in the fake world that I tend to stop caring about the real world.

Whenever I'm playing scenarios in my head, I even reenact the emotions that go with them so if it's something upsetting, I'll begin to cry and if it's something that angers me..the frustration will be evident in my facial expressions. If I were to record myself when I'm day dreaming, I would look like a complete idiot..just imagine someone pacing back and forth in their room completely silent while making obscene facial expressions and gestures. I have some really fucking weird ones, like sometimes I have ones where I try to garner sympathy for myself, I'll envision going into class after having done chemotherapy and imagine all the people and the professor showing concern for me. I don't know why I find it all so self-gratifying so I don't mind my life being a shit show because I can always go back to living in my mind. I'm realizing that this is becoming an issue and is hindering me from dealing with real life duties, and I know it'll only get worse but I don't know how to stop it. ",08Sep2017,1
46,"This is obviously a troll account.  I don't use it that often, but sometimes I get bored, or too good of an opportunity to mess with people just comes up and you just have to take it.

&gt; Not arch linux.  Downvoted.  

LMAO!!!  For those who don't know, Arch Linux is a flavor of the Linux operating system.  It requires the user to be a little more advanced than other flavors of Linux do, so this naturally have caused some better-than-thou Arch Linux snobs to be born.  Here I pretend to be such an elitist, contributing nothing to the conversation while triggering people about my elitism.

&gt; /u/dwimback, I just thought I would let you know that you are my biggest role model.  I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I think the GOP is actually doing some great things for America and I thank you for showing your support by revealing how immature Obama is on the political stage.  

Okay, so /u/dwimback (formerly and again /u/dw-im-here) is a famous troll who I was simply paying tribute to.

Calling something out for being NSFW unexpectedly when no one cares, and when it's questionably NSFW?  Classic!!!

&gt; Except that Inglorious Bastards is probably one of the worst, most nonintellectual movies out there.  How could such a brilliant director be so delusional about how Hitler *actually* died?  

Not only insulting a movie that people like, but feigning to misunderstand the point of the movie.  Classic recipe for downvotes.  Also, it's hilarious when people think a troll comment is a joke or an honest wacko comment, it's just so adorable.  Also, [""downvote you out of peer pressure""](/r/movies/comments/2ucvhb/greatest_line_in_a_tarantino_film/co7gw10/?context=3)... ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS!!! And so honest!!!!!

&gt; Bad advice, that is a big risk to take.  As a cat owner, I have touched stray cats only to come home and transfer fleas to my cat.  Also, the first vet would see that the stray is clearly not his own, as he would not have identification for it.
&gt; 
&gt; If OP follows this advice, he **might as well just put down his cat right now and deliver it to the closest Chinese shop.**

&gt; Can we please not post content like this on Reddit?  Some people find it offensive.  Perfect example on what happens to sub's when they get deafaulted.  

Claiming something is offensive for no apparent reason?  Check.  Instructing people to behave a certain way on Reddit?  Check.  Circlejerking against default subs?  Check.  Easy to see how this baby racked up -210 points.

Okay, so let me spell this out for you if you don't get it.  /r/rateme is a sub where people post pictures of themselves and ask for ratings on how they look.  I carefully craft a title that would not stick out compared to the rest of the posts in the sub.  I then **BAMBOOZLE** the fuck out of you with a picture of an 18 year old dog, who is clearly getting older, as the title suggests.  Isn't this just too fucking wholesome?  I am quite proud of this one.  

Also, I [got banned because of this one](https://i.imgur.com/tBuH0yG.png) but I'm sure the mod got a nice hearty laugh out of it.

""Are you fucking *SUPTID?*""  &lt;--- LMAO!!!!! Too brilliant! I was ROTFL when I crafted this comment, it's just so fucking ironic.  I am very glad someone quoted me on ""suptid"", this is just far too perfect.  For some context, I was feigning to be a very Trigger McTriggered Redditor who was reacting to what was becoming a heated flamewar on the merits of astroturf on desert lawns.

&gt; Lol, ʟɪʙᴇʀᴀʟꜱ.  Honestly I am glad Trump is so old.  He might croak before he even gets inundated in Jaunary and then Mike Pence would get elected.  Everyone talks about how great Trump is, but Pence is the change America *really* needs.  
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, let's be real -- the ʟɪʙᴇʀᴀʟꜱ will just keep shoving evolution and climate change down our throats meanwhile ISIS is planning to bomb us.  Come on, people, let's get this country's priorities straight.  ISIS first, then we can fight about whether onions are gluten free enough for you.  

Blah blah, retarted and unpopular opinions, whatever.  But the **absolutely best** part of this comment is my use of sᴍᴀʟʟ ᴄᴀᴘs (special unicode characters, which are just uppercase glyphs with the height of lowercase ones).  I mean, just look how absolutely absurd ""ʟɪʙᴇʀᴀʟꜱ"" looks!  As far as troll comments go, it does not get more obvious than this (yes, other user, this was not subtle).

&gt; I went when the trail while the trail was closed for a few weeks a couple years ago.  The water was pretty cold, but it was a great chance to go swimming without having other bothersome people nearby.  
&gt; 
&gt; We were camping for several days in the region, so I also took the opportunity to take a quick ""shower"" under the waterfalls (with a travel sized biodegradable shampoo to the rescue).  A hot shower seems much nicer in retrospect, but honestly it just felt great to get clean after days of stank.

Okay so the context here is that I was pretending to tell a story about how I went swimming in a pristine ecosystem that you absolutely should not go swim in.  And of course I tell it in such a way as to sound clueless that what ""I did"" was a complete dick move.
