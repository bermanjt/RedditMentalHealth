7,"I'm getting really tired of the way that society expects people to always agree with the hivemind, and if you don't, you're considered to be an outcast and are treated horribly, even if you didn't do or say anything wrong. Because of my Asperger's Syndrome, I've always been more empathetic than most people, and I'm likely to sympathize with people who are being hated on by the hivemind, rather than blindly hating on them simply because the hivemind is doing so. I'm also somewhat of a contrarian and seeing things from multiple points of view (rather than just the most popular point of view) has always come easily to me. These things have led to me being hated on by various hiveminds more often than I can count, and has caused me to only sporadically use social media, since most social media sites have very vocal hiveminds who are not afraid to use their anonymity as an excuse to treat me like shit. 

As a result of all this, I have very few social outlets. My Asperger's Syndrome makes me horrible at making and keeping friends, so I only have one semi-close friend right now, and I'm also quite close with my mom, and I'm really open and honest with my therapist as well. That's it, though. I spend a lot of time alone, trying to distract myself from my self-hateful thoughts (which are pretty much constant these days after 30 years of being treated like an outcast), and for two weeks out of every month, the fact that I'm a female means that I have to deal with suicidal thoughts/urges as well. (I have [Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premenstrual_dysphoric_disorder) Lucky me.) I do take meds for my depression, but they only help so much, and it's largely up to me to keep it under control other than that. Oh, and did I mention that I also have social anxiety, general anxiety disorder, and a whole host of digestive disorders (IBS, acid reflux, and bile reflux)? Oh, and my digestive disorders are triggered by stress, and my stress levels have been skyrocketing lately since I've had to force myself to try to live a normal adult life despite my disability and my mental illnesses, so I've been struggling to eat enough.

Most recently it's been Charlie Puth and Lapsley to catch my attention vocally, but I hate most of their songs :( I feel like they have such raw, incredible talent that's wasted on crappy music.

9,"I'm a broke ass high school kid who's down on his luck searching for a job. I ran out of money from my summer job a couple weeks back, and have been coasting on my cash ""reserves,"" which was basically all the paper money in my wallet that I'd accumulated over Christmases/birthdays.

Every day I lift weights in school, so I have to change into gym clothes. Unfortunately we don't have a locker room next to our weight room, so we all just change in the bathroom and then set our stuff next to the bleachers (where it's in plain sight, which would hopefully dissuade people from stealing from you). Unfortunately, today I wasn't so lucky. I was having a conversation with one of my buddies while changing in the bathroom, and I guess on my way out I was so caught up in talking to him that I didn't even notice I'd left my jeans on top of his pile of stuff (which he leaves in the bathroom because he's got nothing to steal). So lo and behold, I figure out after class I'd left my jeans there, but didn't think much of it (it's been almost a whole semester and I have yet to be stolen from, so I figured I had nothing to worry about).

Fast forward to tonight, I'd gone to eat some buffalo wings with my pals, and knowing that my debit card was essentially empty I dipped into my cash reserves. Wouldn't you know it, every single 10 and 20 I had was gone. Mind you, I'm not totally sure how much that was (I don't like to count money, ignorance is bliss), but I know there was at least six of those 20s. All that remained were my singles and fives (presumably left in the hopes that I wouldn't notice a significant number of bills missing). So now not only am I out of money on my card, but all of the money I'd been saving to use on a rainy day like this is missing, and I'm sure some dumbass kid from my weight training class is about to have a shiny new vape because of it. Fuck humans, man. I've got an interview at Cracker Barrel tomorrow morning, so... wish me luck. Maybe tomorrow will be kinder.",09Nov2017,8
10,"Night before yesterday, a little black one. We took her to the vet, gave her antibiotics, vaccinated her etc. and she just vanished overnight. I can still hear her mom, crying for her around the yard and it's driving me crazy.


Today, a little chubby grey tabby was gone. She barely ever moved from my yard, she was my favorite. Those aren't my cats. They just live here in my front yard, we give them food and water and shelter. I live somewhere in the Balkans so there are feral and stray cats pretty much everywhere. I just get so attached to these bastards. I know myself and I know I will think about them for years. What happened? Of course, they are free to roam around everywhere. Maybe a car hit one of them, the other one roamed too far. Or they got stolen. I don't know. The grey one could be in heat. I don't know. It just sucks, but such is life I guess.",09Nov2017,9
11,"Well, this actually happened yesterday. 

She came over. He was working late again, and she was tired of eating dinner alone. She picked up a gram and I picked up takeout. I hadn't smoked since college, which was a bit longer ago for me than for her. After dinner and a smoke session, i asked if she wanted to watch some tv. She checked her phone and said she can stay a while. 

She sat close to me on the couch and pulled the blanket over us. Her hair smelled like coconuts. I could tell she wasn't in a good state of mind, and it took all I had to not make a move. Our legs were touching under the blanket. I knew that she knew I wanted to kiss her, and maybe she wanted me to too. But after some time, she said she should go. As she left she looked into my eyes in a way that could have melted me. I wanted to ask her to stay. I wanted to throw her on my bed and feel my skin on hers.

24,"I'm currently taking microbiology at the county college. My best friend is a lab tech there, we can call her M, and since I live with her, I know about a lot of the drama and ongoings within the lab. 

Recently my class has been doing an unknown project where we have to identify the microorganisms. M knows what my organisms are (but we are both very academically honest so she won't tell me and I don't wanna know). I described to her the morphology of one of my plates and M said it was very wrong, and there might be contamination, and to talk to my professor, D, about it.


I talk with D, and she seems very unhappy about the fact M has told me anything at all, and basically that an employee should not be discussing such matters with a student. D says it's not my fault but she's happy that she knows now what's going on in the lab a little more.


This obviously doesn't look good for M. Neither of us would have expected that reaction from D.

27,"I always knew it (or at least felt it), I wasn’t cut for the corporate world. But I always said to myself “Hey, everyone is doing it, it can’t be that bad, at least it’s secure”. As time passed, that argument started sounding like a lame excuse. A self-resentment started creeping in, and before I knew it. That started to be how I feel most of the day. Maybe it’s the age, the 30 effect as I like to call it, pretty sure I am not the first one to do so. As I approached 30 (29 currently), the arguments started sounding sillier and sillier. I look around at what a carrier can give in my bosses and the bosses of my bosses, and I always feel the same way. I don’t want that, I just don’t want it. Don’t get me wrong here, there’s nothing wrong with choosing a carrier life, and I have nothing other than respect and admiration for all my bosses and coworkers including the assholes of them. But I believe that it is wrong to choose a carrier when your gut is telling not to. The rule is simple, do what you want to do, pretty simple, yet pretty hard. That’s where resentment was coming from in my case. If you don’t like it, you should not be doing it because someone who does like it could be in your place and will be living their dream job. 

When I first moved to NYC from California, I ordered a new bed frame from Wayfair, it took me 6 hours to put that sucker together, an awful experience. I am pretty sure that many people can relate to this, you buy that nice Ikea furniture, you look at the instructions manual, it’s too complicated. So you try to use common sense to put it together. After 1 hour, you realize that your common sense, instincts, and your basic survival skills won’t cut it. So you curse the manufacturer or Sweden in case of Ikea and you go back to that instruction manual and with a defeated face, you follow the steps. 5 hours later, mission accomplished, ends up with extra parts, cursed 97 times, picked a fight with your significant other, and finished a wine bottle. 

That was my Aha moment (such a cliché), I said to myself, fix this and you will make life little bit better for lot of people. So, I came up with a name (Instuktionz; instructions was too expensive.), built a great team, kicked off our prelaunch campaign and we are launching our free IOS and Android apps in 3 weeks. What’s Instruktionz? Glad you asked, instead of reading product instructions, you download our free app , scan the product barcode, and voila, a video will automatically play with fun and HD instructions. The cool thing is that we cover all products, from how to make that perfect spaghetti to putting together that Ikea bed. 

This is where I stand as of now, which bring brings me back to our topic, why I decided to leave. I don’t know how it’s going to work out but I know that I am jumping off the cliff. The water looks cold, but I am super excited for the future. I will be creating following posts to share updates on my journey off the path, hoping it will provide other people in similar situations with an inside look, a tiny window to see what happen when take that leap of faith. Until then, “Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Do not go gentle into that good night.”

Upvote if you think I should keep posting updates on this journey.

28,"I don't know what triggered it. I just can't feel anything. I mean I get mad and I laugh and shit but inside nothing's changed.

I've even put myself in situations where normally I'd feel something, I've gotten rejected, ive worked dangerous jobs, I've gotten drunk and high and been sober and taken half day long walks and nothing.

It's like a switch has been flipped. I don't care about anything, and I don't know how to undo it. I don't know why I'm even here to be honest but I don't care enough to be suicidal about it. 

It's like I've become an outsider in my own body. Trying to follow social cues and act appropriately and just robotically living. I used to just go home and sleep and work and then home and sleep. Trying to fix this I've been doing more shit but it's all so fake feeling.


Like. We live to die and the inbetween is trying to forget the end. Just work for 45 or so years to survive and then die. Life just seems to have no value. I can't even build relationships because I have a hard time keeping track of people and remembering them, and to try care about them. 

And it's not like I'm selfish either, I always give people priority over myself because they always seem to have more to live for, and more capable of the life they have been given.

If I could sleep until my life was expired, I would. 

I am literally just waiting to die eventually and I know it's fucked and I can't stop it.

31,"So today a bunch of girls fought about something in the gym and it turned to a physical fight where they grabbed each others hair,the gym was full of students so every one turned to see what happened........some boys started acting like they are separating the girls from each other while sexually touching them, the two girls started to cry when they felt all those hands on them, thankfully a teacher was able to crawl through the students and the boys stopped when they saw the teacher, they were taken to the principles office where they explained why they cried, no one said who was touching them and no one was blamed, the even sicker part is how i heard the boys later proudly bragging about how they fucking sexually harassed the girls and the other boys saying they wish they did too, i'm a guy btw and i feel so fucking sick and disgusted

Tell me what you think about this and I'm sorry for my bad english

Edit: i..i think am gonna try to go tell the principal about the ones i saw touch the girls, im not sure if i should tell him about the ones who said they did because maybe they were just bragging to look cool without actually doing it so i would be blaming them for something they didnt do, tell me who should i tell about and how please i dont know what to say :(

there are a lot of signs that I can tell from her body language and I get the idea that maybe there's a door  that could actually open here, but I'm also realize that I'm not objective. and that maybe I'm interpreting things incorrectly from what they really are.

34,"So today I was in a situation where a person I work with was in a foreign country and has got issues. 

A part from doing my job and finding flights to get them back there is not much more I could do (admin). Every one was on the case and was being helpful but I couldn’t help but feel awful for not being able to do much more. 

They are a friend but also a coworker so our relationship is not strong. Yet I couldn’t even eat because I was worried about how they felt (I’m usually always hungry). 

Years ago I was told I could not work in humanitarian aid because I am over empathic, and in a way I get it. I really care way too much when I know someone is not ok and it would affect my capacity to work properly.

I’ve been living in a big city for 4 years and I have called an ambulance for random people on the streets (usually passed out drunk) at least 14 times because I cannot not do something. I also know most of the homeless people in my neighborhood by name and stop by to have a chat from time to time, which just ends up making me feel empty and raging. I don’t do this in front of other people I do it for myself/the person I am talking to. 

The thing is that it affects me way too much, and even if I like that trait in me I think it might also be a prejudice. 

Is there a way to stop caring? Is it an ok thing to do? 

I want to also specify that I don’t really want to come across as a savior, don’t get me wrong I just want to know your opinion whether I should just stop caring or caring less or keep going I guess.

37,"I'm still shook up by this, it happened maybe fifteen minutes ago.

I had just gotten off the bus and was happily listening to some tunes. I went to cross a four lane road, the first half of the road stopped for me and there was no issue. As I started to cross the second half, I saw a car coming off the roundabout pretty quickly.

It wasn't something out of the ordinary, people drive like that here, they usually come to a screeching halt to let pedestrians like me cross. Except he didn't stop.

I locked eyes with the driver and he moved his gaze away from mine right as he accelerated and flew inches past me.

Now, I am from a country where the car is the king of the road and drivers would never stop for a pedestrian. Because of that, I am very hesitant to cross roads, I wait until cars have clearly seen me and slowed down or stopped before stepping onto their path.

That habit saved me from serious injury or death today, if I had trusted the driver to stop, I'd probably be in the hospital right now.

Moral of the story, never trust drivers even if you live in a first world country and they usually stop for you, your life could be saved.",09Nov2017,1
38,"For many years on Christmas we barely spend any money. My parents didn't had any money to give us gifts, so it was always a tiny gift. Like a book or just 50€ (which was still a lot of money!) they are trying, though. I've moved out about 3 years ago and visited them on Christmas, and I still get tiny gifts from them and I statt to feel bad, because I want to give something back, and Christmas is a nice time. But I still don't have any money to give them something good and thoughtful. I know my mum wants something for her kitchen, but I don't know if my mum already bought it and for my dad... I am not sure. I kind of want him to get a camera for the car, in case of needed evidence. But I also heard it's a grey area in Germany and that it may not be allowed. Not 100% certain about it. 

And then my two brothers! So not sure what to get them! I was thinking about steam gift cards perhaps. But that sounds boring. 
One of them is into anime and manga and kind of learns Japanese that way it seems. Maybe a Japanese learning book?

But there’s *always* someone just *slightly* better than me. Why can’t I get a break? Why can’t I be the one that’s slightly better?

On the phone, the recruiter said it pained her to reject me and that they took the extra time to come up with their decision just because of how hard it was and that she’s going to try to get me another interview. Don’t get me wrong, these are all nice things to hear during a rejection but I’m just tired of hearing it over and over again. Even if I got the job, I’d be lying if I said I wouldn’t be at least a bit bitter or resentful. I’m well qualified for this position and, not to sound elitist, I’m more qualified than others who got this position. I guess connections matter...

Even college is something I had to beg for. I was rejected from my school but I then submitted an appeal and got in. There’s a ton of other stuff I could go into but I just won’t. The fact of the matter is that I’m depressed and broken but as an exhausted and dysfunctional human being, I have to put on the facade that I’m happy and eager to face these rejections and hurdles. I get that the end goal should be worth it - and it is - but I’m fucking tired of having to put in 110% (when it seems like others are only putting in 80% or even 70%) just to run into another fucking obstacle.
