0,"I came across this bizarre situation today on my bus to work that left me puzzled. About two stops from where I got picked up, a black woman entered the bus and approached the bus driver who was also a black woman, and said something to her about not having enough money then proceeded to sit down near the front of the bus. She got comfortable and started unloading items from her bag which the driver did not appreciate.

At first I wasn’t paying much attention and when I heard the driver raise her voice I got a little anxious. With her head turned back toward the passengers, it wasn’t clear to me who she was addressing. For a while the driver was trying to convince the woman to come to the front and pay up. Still confused I gestured at the driver asking, “Are you talking to me?” This of course made no sense because I had a bus pass that’s still good for about five months.

When I realized she wasn’t talking to me I immediately looked at the woman. She was staring blankly and looking confused. I don’t know if she was just refusing to acknowledge the driver’s commands or was as unsure as I was. The driver was quickly getting agitated, repeating the same thing again.

The woman asked me if I could spare a dollar which made me return the same blank stare we shared. The bus driver now furious yelled, “No panhandling on the bus!” The woman said she needed to get to the hospital. I wasn’t sure if this was a fabrication to gain sympathy and let her unpaid fare slide but it obviously didn’t do her any good. The woman asked me for a dollar again and I was just trying my hardest to ignore it.

The bus driver was now telling the woman to get off the bus or she would call the police. She acknowledged that everyone present had places they needed to go and that no one had time for this.

For minutes it seemed like the same sentences got repeated over and over with other passengers beginning to join in. A couple people were trying to get her to leave the bus, some saying that she should wait for the next one and another I distinctly heard shouting, “You’re going to jail!” She seemed to sit there in awe at all this commotion, seeming like she was unable to process what she had done wrong.

I was half feeling like I should have stepped up and just gave her the dollar in order to resolve the problem, as I believe some of other passengers must have felt but I was fearful that doing so would make the bus driver upset causing her to force me off the bus as well. Like everyone else I had my place I needed to go and I didn’t want that privilege revoked. Everyone seemed to be reduced to bystanders or just had to reinforce the driver’s wishes.

Eventually the woman left the bus. I can’t say that I was not relieved because it was an awkward position for everyone to be faced with. Throughout it all though I couldn’t help feeling that this scenario would have turned out a bit different if it was a woman of the same status except that they had been white. If you had to deal with a situation like this would you have done things differently?",04Feb2017,2

7,"I've been talking with this girl from online for a while now and we seem to be a great match. I've also been dealing with really bad anxiety and panic attacks and after I told her she was still really interested in me and supportive so that's a huge plus in my book. We planned to go see The Ring 2 in Boston sunday afternoon but now I'm regretting it for multiple reasons and I'm not sure they are worthy of canceling. 

1. My anxiety is still bad, even with therapy and medication, I'm starting to get better but I keep debating between if dating would help or hurt me right now

2. I'm sick my whole family has this awful cold and I have basically stayed home for 2 days. I really don't think I'll be feeling 100% on sunday and I don't want to get her sick

3. It's Super Bowl Sunday now neither of us like football or care but it's going to be a bitch and a half for me to get into Boston that day and parking will be impossible (public transportation is one of the things I struggle with anxiety)

4. I shouldn't have agreed to see the ring 2 because when I was a kid I saw the original and it fucked me up for a good month. I couldn't sleep and I was so scared of that girl. Now the second one looks so dumb so I'm not super worried but still I'd rather see literally anything else aside from this movie, but I already said yes

I really, really like this girl but I'm not sure what to do. I hate, hate canceling on people and I feel like if I do that it's all over. Then again there's a lot of reasons, aside from #1 and maybe #4 that are good enough to warrant canceling ",04Feb2017,1

10,"My mum is a dead weight, she's not motherly she's not instinctive, she's lazy but she's my mum and she's raised me, I have to respect her. 
My dad hates my mum, he's a mothers boy, which is fine. But grandmas two faced, not even gonna lie. Today and a few other times I'd ask if she had something like a chocolate bar, she says no, when there is some... I don't feel weird asking, I grew up there like wtf. Am I a stranger now? Do they not like me because I also side with my mum?  Because I see right and wrong? 
And grandma never points out the good things I ever to, which is a fucking lot, I do everything she asks. But she highlights everything I do wrong. 

Mum is so stupid she'll sell me out instantly, she'll drive me to kill myself. 
Grandma loves my dad and my brother because he's a boy. Dad loves his boys and his mum, just not me.. He might like my baby sister a little bit but she's no use to him. 
""I'm lucky to have been bought back and given a proper home and food because my incompetent mother could not have provided and I would have been a beggar""... Bless up. 
I'm just an inconvenience. Dad and grandma will never like me because I have my own brain and I'm a girl. Mum is as supportive as a wall. A wall is more supportive to be honest. 
My intentions are right, I'm not a perfect kid but I'd never sell anyone out and I stupidly put others needs before mine and I have to stop doing that (I mean my FAMILY won't even do that for me). 
I get good grades, I care for everyone a lot. I don't go out loads. I'm home early, I have had to do everything alone. But no one else in my family had to. 

I kill myself for other people and I have to stop. Just pieces of me given away, my hard work given away and no one can pay the same respect back. Had a stupid friend I helped, just sat here thinking in the year of knowing this friend, what have I ever gained. Nothing, like the bare possible minimum, where like I get a text reply.

19,"First off I understand how a lot of people have very bad situations that involve needing to come to a new country. But I would like to be a little selfish today as I just got an email saying I have been rejected for residency in the country I live. 

It's upsetting and heartbreaking. I'm living in Canada and the Canadian immigration has been very hard on me and throwing curve balls throughout this process that I started 2 years ago, I'm Irish, many people from Ireland come here and give up because immigration is so difficult for some. 

So, my visa expired May 17th 2016, I was fully prepared to move back to Ireland and continue my permanent residency (PR) application from there, but a few weeks before I had to leave I met a guy, a guy I had known of for at least a year as we work together, but we hung out and I fell in love, I applied for an extension on my work visa and that gave me 3 months of working, Then it expired, so I haven't been working since August last year. Thankfully I can stay in Canada on a visitors status so I live with my boyfriend, we have been together for 8 months and we have never spent a day apart unless one of us is away. 

I'm applying for residency to stay in the country I have built a life in but I want to spend my life with this man, we live together and he has been supporting me, we want to get married but not under these circumstances. 

So my application for PR was rejected about an hour ago and although I know I could have other options and everything will be ok in the long run, believe me I know that, I have love and support. But for something I have been working to get for the last year, getting it rejected today when the end was so close is such a blow and I don't know how to get through the next few days with a happy face and how I can explain this to my friends and family. 

This is a total rant. I don't expect anyone to 100% be able to give advice but if anyone managed to salvage some sort of sensical thought through my rambles. Please tell me how I can move forward, not even how I can stay in the country, but I mean, tomorrow... how do I feel happy, how do I snap myself out of this. I'm heartbroken. I've obsessed over my PR for just over a year and now it's all gone and all of my work is nothing. ",04Feb2017,39
22,"... an out-of-control manned-spacecraft returning from Mars. It had a great mission, some setbacks, but we were feeling good. The whole world was giddy, with a slow excitement building at their long awaited return. The public didn't know the truth.

They didn't know there was a problem. State secrets are, after all, secret. 

""We're on a need to know basis around here.""

*We* knew that it was going to collide with our atmosphere and there were no signs of any respectable braking systems. Many were proposed, but the MarsCraft explorers lacked adequate resources and were short on time.

3 months ago space agencies from the US, China, and Canada, as well as Red Bull and Elon Musk, attempted to deflect the MarsCraft into a safe orbit around the earth.

That mission ultimately failed. For the mission to succeed the crew aboard the MarsCraft needed to help with some maneuvers. Unfortunately they had lost all will to live and couldn't be bothered to stop drinking their own moonshine.

35,"My Dearest Ego

I know if you’re reading this we are broken, beyond repair. Your second chances run out many years ago but like a gullible teenager I was all in at my own expense with my only out card being the miracle card for which I held my breath and prayed. Turns out it was never in the deck. You held this in your own hands and denied it me whilst being witness to my turmoil and despair.

I am unable now or in my foresight to contemplate forgiveness. I was cannon fodder for your impending self-destruction. I love you deeply, and know you love me unconditionally. Unfortunately, for fear of my own demise I can no longer reciprocate the unconditional part.

There is greatness in you. You act selflessly in so many ways. You bring joy and wonderful insight to helping others but as the old saying goes ´those who can do, those who can´t teach´. You will never be accused of leading by example.
To watch you destroy yourself with tobacco, barely eating somedays and gorging the next and substituting alcohol with coffee and caffeine baffled me. It makes me wonder if your sobriety is indeed progress. How could I ever believe you care for me with such little regard and disdain for your own well being?

Today we died. I can’t watch the man I love self-destructing and procrastinate endlessly about changes that never see the light of day. You told me that hitting rock bottom was necessary for your sobriety, my fear my dear ego, my wonderful spirited ego is that surviving rock bottom once is a blessing, courting it twice seems like reckless abandonment at best, a death wish more likely. I never signed up for your cruel mind games. Part of me has already died for you. I want you to know that I resent what you have taken from me.

From this day forward I am never going to think on you again. I will however cherish the words you shared with me every single day, having with hindsight learned their true meaning. “Higher self, you are there and I am here. Clearly one of us is in the wrong place.”

I was a dumb captivated fool. You made everything look easy. You left me clues from the beginning. Your words were not to imply a sense of missing me. It was all merely a tug of war disguised easily with your brilliance. Now, I see that you are there and I am here and through death we are exactly for the first time in as many in the right place.

RIP my dear Ego.

37,"It's low self-esteem. I have a low opinion of myself, even when I have no reason to. I have lots of things going for me, the attention of attractive women, a really great job, lots of talents, friends and family that enjoy my company. And yet I'm hyperfocused on all my shortcomings, and I'm squandering all of these opportunities that I should be grateful for, that absolutely should make me happy.

&amp;nbsp;

Needless to say, I'm depressed, and I'm obsessing over the attention of a particular girl. She's unhealthy for me, seeing her happy reminds me of how unhappy I am. I am beginning to wonder if this tendency towards sadness is just a part of my personality, if I will always just take everything so seriously. If it's just a part of this depressive/anxious phase, then how am I going to let go of the shame of having let myself go this far?

&amp;nbsp;

I am veritably wasting away. I ignore my friends, I am hardly productive at work (to the point of potentially losing this job), I am letting some girl walk all over me, putting her on some pedestal as if she's the star in the movie that's supposed to be about MY life! I haven't learned to trust myself, and I see how others' lives and opinions so heavily influences my own to the point of paralysis, to the point of not knowing whether I'm actually doing anything for myself or just to get someone to like or love me.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't feel like I know who I am. The parts of myself I think I do know, I really don't like. I don't know where this dismal perspective on myself came from, but it's honestly like some disease that is slowly killing me from the inside. I'm scared that I'll be this way the rest of my life. Maybe I'll get better here and there, but it'll just be a respite from who I truly am. This loser, who doesn't believe in himself, has learned helplessness, and is wasting his life away.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, I know what you'll say. It's these very thoughts that are making me feel this way. I would never let a friend talk to me this way, so why do I permit myself to do it? I know I should change the langauge I use to describe myself, that I should think more positively about everything. But how does that work? Is it just vacuous positivity (vacuous because it feels like self-deception) until eventually your brain somehow catches on?

&amp;nbsp;

I'm writing this partly for catharsis, because I'm at wit's end. I just want relief, but don't think it'll be that easy. I'm also partly writing this wishing someone can give me hope that it can get substantially better. That I can forgive myself for feeling this way, and that I can actually thrive and be happy. Fuck, even just be content, smile here and there, and be goofy, like a kid. With peace of mind. Someone, anyone, please tell me that it's possible. That you've done it, or know someone who has. I can't share this with anyone because of all the shame I feel, and as a result I don't feel connected to anyone. This is not how human should live their life....

42,"I've never been good at anything. I got picked last for every sport as a kid. 

As a kid, I tried the following and was literally the worst out of the following:

Baseball, chess, martial arts, bowling, hockey, video production, drama club, school newspaper, fencing.

I can't dance worth a shit so I can't do that. I have severe social anxiety so I can't be charismatic. I'm horrible at any exercise that involves other people so I only exercise alone. I have no hand eye coordination so I can't shoot a gun. 

I've only had two sex partners so I'm probably not very good at sex. I went to film school and barely graduated and I'm terrible at that too despite loving that more than anything else. 

Sure it takes 10,000 hours to get good at anything but I was never physically strong and never particularly tall and for some reason everyone was always better at everything than I could ever be. I seem to be incapable of improving in any capacity.

So now all I am is an ugly 21-year-old with only two sex partners and a completely useless degree. The only thing I'm good at is being able to pay the fucking bills. I have no skills or talent in anything at all. I am not particularly funny, not particular social, not particularly attractive. People are only liked because of who they are as people but I'm an incredibly boring person who appeals to no one. 

I'm not funny, I'm not witty, I'm not charming.
I'm just a big piece of nothing. After six suicide attempts in three years I'm not even good at dying. I literally can't even die correctly. 

I've never been first place in anything. I've never been anyone's first choice to spend time with. I'm nothing but the last resort in any capacity, that really shitty fast food restaurant you eat at at 2 in the morning when nothing else is open.

Unfortunately, his behavior and mental health gradually got worse and worse. He started acting terribly, saying horribly abusive malicious hateful things. I would call him out on it, and then we would argue and argue and argue and yell at each other and scream at each other. it was exhausting.

Then he would be okay for a little bit. That he would start up with the really awful, horrible, hateful malicious crap again. I know it was a undiagnosed mental illness, most likely borderline personality disorder coupled with bipolar disorder. But he refused treatment.

Finally, for my own mental health I had to tell him to fuck off. It was 100% the right thing to do. There is no question about it.

But the thing is… I miss him. He's the only person I talked to about certain things. I don't have many good friends, and losing one that I knew for that long, really hurts.
