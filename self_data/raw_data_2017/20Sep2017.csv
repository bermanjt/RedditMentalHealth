1,"hey i am new at reddit and i founded this space to talk about a problem i had lately. you see, im from Argentina, that country at the south of America,Maradona,Messi,THE POPE (;)) .
I am in high school, and here we have something called centers of studients, that are basicly places where you can organize and defend the public education from this neoliberal goverment.
Now i am in a political organization as a candidate, and it sounds unimportant but it is stressful, right now we have taken our school and we kicked the authorities because they want us to go working for free in huuuuge corporations and cut out school subjects very importants, for example HISTORY. 
There are about 30 schools taken by different students and we dont know if we are going to win.
Nothing, that has me worried and scared, mostly because of my sister, i dont care about myself i am about to start university, but i dont want the next generations to go cleaning toilets at malls.

I made every post on here as a reflection of myself, so my future relatives can know me.

I know, I know....I'm a big-ass baby. It's weird because I'd like to believe my life is pretty normal. Great career, ton of hobbies/projects...but I can't sleep without him. And my fiancee is starting to get sick of him. 

I love him (I think its because my parents never let me have any pets growing up....so I got attached to tigger and had to pretend he was real/my pet) but now I think I need to face the fact I need to grow out of him....

8,"Isn't it strange
Family and society are so separated 
You are told to stand up for yourself, yet not against your parents
Your parents don't have the concept of the golden rule, or at least not mine
They dish out insults and punishments for reasons but can't take it back even when at fault 
If it's your fault, they yell at you. If you're actually right, they turn it on you anyway

They say they love you, but it is hard to see it

""If we didn't love you, you would be out on the street and starving"" yeah thanks I feel loved now

""Opinions matter"" f no they don't, not at home

Don't they see they are the reason I am a smart mouth, sarcastic and narcissistic. ""You used to be so kind and caring. What happened?"" You.

I feel I have something to say, I'm going to say it

I could give less fs if I get in trouble, might as well get it out of the way

And just like that I become the one person I thought I would never be, the disrespectful angsty teen that stresses out the parents and acts like a punk all the time

And when we argue I cry. I guess it works out because they think it's because I realize how stupid I'm being while actually I'm so pissed it hurts and it's all coming out at once

They treat me differently then they treat my sisters, and act as if we are all equal. BS. 

I even have thought about suicide. How pathetic am I. Have a life better then half the world, but because I think it's unfair death might be okay. I could never do it, ya know. I couldn't do that to my dad. Me and him fight a lot. But we get along the best in the family and he is constantly going over the top for me.

I am brutally honest, and I don't care if the colleges that I'm applying to see this. Might as well see the real me. People are so fake on college and job applications.

12,"For whatever reason, I'm really picky when it comes to girls I want to be involved with. Maybe it's the realization that a relationship will either end in heartbreak, or it won't at all, and I don't want to have to go through more hardship. 

Hell, I've never even been in a true relationship, despite being 19 and people telling me I'm attractive and a great guy or whatever. I've had ""things"" or ""flirtationships"" (I think I heard it called that once) with enough girls to make me think I'd be a good boyfriend candidate, but that never seems to work out. I've fucked up one or two of them, and I made sure to learn from it, but the rest just never worked out, for many various reasons. 

Last semester, I met this amazing girl who I couldn't help but fall for. We had a writing class together and since the class was really laid back, I got to talk to her quite a bit. Over the course of a couple months, it got to the point where it seemed like she was genuinely interested in me, so I asked her out. You'd think with me being pretty close with this girl and talking to her outside of class for many hours that she'd find a moment to bring up her boyfriend of 2 and a half years, but that never happened, and I felt like a fool. 

This girl was still amazing though so I made sure she stayed in my life as a friend, despite her worries it would be awkward (never was). For whatever reason though, I couldn't get over her. A week after asking her out, my feelings were still raging. That week turned into a month, then two, then before you know it, it was going on a year, and I still couldn't help but look at her as this perfect woman for me. 

Throughout that ten months or so, no other girls caught my eye. It's not like I was avoiding them or anything, but no one sparked my interest, until last week. 

Exposition aside, I was extremely attracted to this girl and in our short 5 minute conversation, she seemed really sweet, kind, and fun to be around. So I naturally asked if she wanted to hang out. Just casually watch some Saturday night college football. 

She came over and after talking for a little while, my arm was across her shoulders and her head leaned on mine. Through constant shifting over the next hour or two, she wound up with her head in my lap and me stroking her beautiful hair. And then she fell asleep. I couldn't help but smile looking down at her. Watching her breathe. 

I've never had a girl fall asleep with me, but man is that one of the best feelings. Knowing she feels comfortable and safe enough with you to fall asleep is just amazing. She eventually woke up, and the story continues to the next night. 

We hung out again, her introducing me to HIMYM, which is just a great show. We end up spooning, and she smelled absolutely incredible. We're stroking each other's arms, and our hands graze, but she doesn't pull away. So I lace my fingers between hers and we twirl our thumbs around each other, and I'm realizing in the moment this is the happiest I've felt in years. 

The night ends and I'm laying in bed, and instead of browsing reddit before I fall asleep like I normally would, I just smelled my shirt for God knows how long. It reeked of her, and I couldn't get enough. I was obsessed, and I needed to see her again. 

Two nights later, we get dinner together and hang out at her place afterwards, which as is tradition, consists entirely of cuddling. This time, the snuggle session begins with her grabbing my hand and holding it herself, giving me the biggest smile. A while later, she ends up falling asleep again with my arms wrapped around her and I follow shortly after. We both wake up and agree to sleep in our own beds because we have early classes the next day. 

The next couple days she acting a little strange. She blew me off twice, is texting me different, and I saw her in the cafeteria with another guy, which isn't a big deal or anything, but it's weird. 

A few nights after the last time we hung out, I went to get dinner at a sandwich shop, and she's there on the patio eating with another guy. My heart skipped every other beat, and I didn't know what to think. I said hi and bye, and was trying to figure out how to handle the situation. 

I deliberated with my close friends, and we came to the agreement to passively ask her where we stood. 

""John, you're a great guy and I really love spending time with you, but I just don't feel that way toward you. I'm sorry I know I should've said something sooner, and I know it's really unfair to you. But you are a great guy and I really want to stay friends with you.""

I don't get it.

I've always taken pride in being able to sympathize with anyone (often to a fault) and I've always been able to see things from other people's perspective. 

But I just didn't get it. 

She said she enjoyed my company, she cuddled me back, she held my hand, she fell asleep in my arms, but she doesn't feel that way about me? 

I'm lost. 

And all I can think about is the way she smells, with my arms wrapped around her.

I don't know why anyone would take the time to read this unorganized behemoth of emotions that have been stuck in me for far too long, but if you did, i hope you enjoyed my suffering :') ",20Sep2017,1
13,"Anyone ever got that mood?      
      
It occurs to me that I should probably talk to my circumstantial friends, or well, friends, but they're not my *friends*, and I know that doesn't matter and what matters is that they're just a pair of ears, but man working up the will to do that? That's,, that's just a lot.       
       
Moving on, stream of thoughts with no direction go: I've just been kind of like an ameoba or whatever lately. I can't really accomplish anything, I gained like ten-fifteen pounds, can't eat healthy lMAo, I have no friend group in the school that I moved to, and even though I've been running more and trying to get on that deficit or like do some ""health"" or to get closer to comfortable weight goals out of spite and personal want because some other friends have been doing ""health"", (one has close to an eating disorder, I must say, I'm envious. I near developed something close in the summer but I decided to stop and haven't put myself all in again so whoop), and my mom who always complains about being fat and buys 400 food and my family who doesn't manage food really, but yeah I binged on a lot of food today (we're talking 3500+ cal?) and only ran like two miles instead of lunch but then I cried and cut for a little bit. I'm,,, well I don't think I'm failing my classes, and to say that I've been would just be a lie for the sake of dramaticisation, but I just feel like I don't,,, I'm just lost. And it's not the same thing that I felt a few years ago, which (I think) was pretty close to depression where I basically could not give a damn in any direction and I didn't want to do *anything at all*, because I can still feel like little sparks of want and enjoyment in me, but I'm just so tired and I think maybe it's like??? life throwing a lot at me, but I know that's unreasonable because what just matters is your outlook on life?? I really don't know. I haven't done any of the homework that I might need to do and I haven't considered if I'd be able to do it in class and I know I have like quizzes or assignments due soon but I kind of just??? don't care? I might consider consuming coffee because that seems to help get rid of the emotions which is great but I kinda just,,, want life to stop. Not like my life to stop, but I just want things to be still and kind of go slow and I just want to rest for a very very long time, even though I know that I don't need to but I want to. I'm jealous(not really, more envious and sad that I can't do it) of my brother who gets to spend time learning enhanced programming since he was able to get into this prestigious program, and I know that I have the resources to do it and well all the information is at my fingertips, but I still just don't I suppose? I also should probably be studying for my language class that I skipped two levels to get into and I want to get better at that- point is, I know that I want to do these things, and these glimmers of want glean ever so slightly within me but I just???????? I don't know maybe today's a bad day? I know that I can get things done and I do but?? Man I really don't know. I subconsciously (yet I know it's unreasonable and dumb) want to blame it on my new school which is full of people who are middle-class suburban which is a dramatic shift from my former, generally-lower-class occupied school who all seem kind of dead inside and the same way, some kind of herd mentality shit maybe I don't know. Maybe it's the lack of friends, haha. My parents are still annoying (not in like an ""annoying way"" but like,,, so many things wrong with them), or it's probably me just being annoying, like for instance I just go mad at my mom for saying I couldn't buy a charger for the fitbit that my uncle let me borrow (he said I could keep it but my mom said no?) and I just kind of went off and cried and it was really dumb and I didn't know why I cried and I made a mistake and didn't buy fanta for my little brother because we ran out of money when we were buying things from the store, and every fucking day is so annoying because they keep reminding me to study for my language class and it ?? i would argue that it prompts me to not fucking study ?????????????????????? and now thinking about it, this might just be shifts in diet or something???? I don't know, life is just a lot and I just want to escape, I want to stop thinking about it. i dont even know if i want to get better, i kind of just want to wallow in non productiveness and i dont know maybe I just need someone to tell me something that I want to hear. I want to cry for a long long time and I just dont really care and I dont have a lot going for me.

You just got to admire the arrogance on these people after being like vegetarians about their religion, and the manner of how they look down on non-believers is impeccable, let alone so distant from the Christian archetype.









During lunch, I was busy with my food and keeping to myself, and silently mocking their conversation, when one lady co-worker started to drag me in...






&gt; *""Yeah, you know skylinepidgin's Christian, right?""*







&gt; *""Yeah...""*






&gt; *""But see how he almost always drinks daily and smokes like a chimney.""*




&gt; *...everyone laughs...*






Triggered, I took a deep breath, aimed at my target and said,









&gt; *""You see, religion isn't hereditary and it's not passed of on the blood. But I don't go around saying 'I'm a Christian, you're not' and look down on people. Unlike someone here...""*






At about this point, I felt the need to name drop. I just had to.








&gt; *...who goes to her cell group every Saturday, but has the potty mouth of a sailor everyday.""*







I added, *""Vices, particularly smoking and alcoholism, are not relative to one's morality, contrary to your popular yet skewed views.""*





One even shot back something about the body being the temple of the Holy Spirit. I said my body does not recognize the Holy Spirit as its sole proprietor and that I am my own god. LOL.





There were faint boos and hiss in the background, but I was proud of what I said.






Anyway, this could just be the spark of a long series of debates in the days to come, rest assured I'll be dusting off my books.








This is also particularly the reason why I don't come out as an atheist for fear of getting a stereotype. However, now that I am out in the open, I might as well live up to it and keep my chin up. I just can't come to terms with the absence of reason and that which cannot be seen can be reconciled with faith. My system just automatically rejects it. And as much as I love intellectual debates backed by facts and concrete evidence, however, there's just something about in engaging debates with Christians. No matter how airtight your arguments are, they just refuse to acknowledge these and that kills the debate in its infancy.







**TL;DR:** 





&gt; *Quick Chicken Nuggets*






&gt; *1. Heat oven to broil. Coat baking rack with nonstick cooking spray. Place rack over baking sheet; set aside.*





&gt; *2. Stir together bread crumbs, garlic powder and thyme in a pie plate; set aside. Stir together mustard and mayonnaise.*





&gt; *3. Reserve about 1/2 cup of mustard mixture for dipping sauce. Brush chicken pieces with remaining mustard mix; place chicken in pie plate with bread crumb mixture, spooning crumbs on top of pieces and pressing to adhere. Transfer to prepared baking rack. Broil for 10 minutes or until cooked through. Serve with reserved dipping sauce and green beans on the side.*

24,"I am an engineering apprentice working in the highways department of the county council. My manager decided for my apprenticeship I should move around teams in highways, not staying at one for longer than 3 months.  In theory this sounds great, give me a well-rounded knowledge of how the whole highways structure works and how different teams work together. However, every department I go to I feel like a work experience kid. I get to shadow my colleagues when they do interesting things, and get given boring menial tasks to complete sometimes – they don’t see the point in training me in anything important as I am not there long enough. But for the majority of the day I sit in the office on the computer with nothing to do, when I ask for things to do it is more small tasks which take a couple minutes. 

When I got the apprenticeship I thought it would be my foot in the door of a really good trade where I could make a career. I wanted to work in a team and make myself a valuable member of the team which would help me get the full time post at the end of the 2 year scheme. However, now a year in I feel far from this. I have gained a basic knowledge of multiple processes but don’t have any I could say I am proficient in. 

The College and coursework side of my apprenticeship is going great, haven’t dropped a mark yet. But I don’t get to put any of this knowledge to use at work. Which is the whole point of the college course – the information would be much more embedded in my brain if I had the chance to put it to use. Instead I complete the units then forget about them because they are no longer relevant to me in my day to day life. 

Overall I am very unsatisfied with my apprenticeship. I come into work most days and sit on the computer, completing the odd task which takes 5 minutes. If I’m lucky I will shadow someone on site or to a meeting. The days drag awfully. Part of me wants to leave and find a job which is more fulfilling, interesting and challenging.  However, I still have a year of my college course to complete – so leaving would mean I would not get the qualification I have been working towards.

28,"Hey, I am 14 years old, boy.  I have a kitten, Tonni, 3 weeks old, but, he is undernutrioned, he can't get to the moms breasts, he keeps getting pushed away. So he's really thin, basically holding a skeleton with fur.

So we would have to feed him with a bottle of kitten milk, but he didn't want to drink it. Yesterday I got him to drink it, not all, but a small fraction, it was enough to get him to crawl, which he couldn't do before because he is so weak.

This day, I fed him in the morning and went to school.  In the pause I wen't home to feed him, and I don't know how, but I could sense something was wrong. I walked into the house, filled up the bottle with kitten milk, and went up to grab him from where he was sleeping.  He's wrapped in a towel and I'm sitting in my chair with the bottle and him, wrapped.  It starts off smooth, he sucks a tiny bit of milk from the bottle, as always. After 5 minutes, he's getting insanely weak, so I have to squirt the milk into his tiny tiny mouth, but, it just stays in there. As soon as his head looks forward down, all the milk just falls out of his mouth, his heart was still pumping a bit.

At that moment I knew he was going to die, so I of course began crying, and he died a minute after the milk fell out of his mouth. It is so hard, sitting here, with him next to me, dead, on the towel he was wrapped in, just laying there.

I don't know how to show it to his mom, and siblings, I don't know what they're gonna do, I just know they're gonna be sad.

38,"hey I’m 30 now. Yesterday was my birthday. I was really grateful for the nice gestures my friends, family, coworkers made for me. Throughout most of the day I was pretty sad though. I just don’t have a lot to show for my 30 years. I’ve certainly got a lot of memories, but they are pretty fucking bitter sweet now. Pretty much all of the successes of my life have been equally off set by failures, and I’m left here at even zero with no immediate prospects for improving my life. That feels pretty shitty, but its important to remember that the only reliable ways to improve your life are pretty much never immediate. 

Like everything else, I couldn’t help but see it all through the lens of my break up. I remembered my best birthday ever, my first one with Megan. She threw a surprise party for me. She printed out a bunch of pictures of me and glued them to party hats. She had Kevin’s sister make a guitar shaped cake. After rehearsal she had one of my band mates stall me and we were going to meet up with Megan at the restaurant by our apartment we always ate at. I was floored. I don’t think I ever felt so special and loved in my whole life. Megan texted me  yesterday and said “Happy birthday! I hope you’re doing well” and I just replied thanks. I would have loved to say a whole lot more but I know that’s just a mistake. I’m 99% sure I replied in the best manner I could have, with nine tenths of a percent reserved for no response at all, and one tenth of a percent reserved for big dramatic romantic gesture. Sure it hurt being alone on my birthday and remembering how nice it used to be, but what really seemed to wreck me after I got that text during lunch yesterday was the fact that ‘thanks’ was the best response. That’s all it is now. 

Last night a had a dream that Megan was pregnant. But in the dream it wasn’t the first time she was telling me. It was something she had told me before but I had sort of forgot, in the way that it’s not top of mind but comes back when refreshed. What was news to me, in this dream, was that she was seeing someone other than who she’s actually seeing in real life. I can’t remember the guys name she said. It’s probably not a real name from real life. In the dream she had said he was from our home town and it was not a name I recognized, which has always been a bit unsettling to me because as a kid who is concerned with social status in a small town I had felt it was my duty to pretty much know everyone, or at least know who they were, so I wouldn’t be missing out. In the dream I didn’t know if she had began seeing this person recently or a long time ago, if the pregnancy was planned or not. Either way she was moving on with her life in a very real way. For me, in the dream, it was not devastating. It was not an explosion of emotion, like some of our real life conversations of her moving on have been. It was a defeated feeling. Like “well…”. When I woke up I remembered the dream pretty fucking vividly, and the resigned attitude I had in the dream was converted to an optimistic feeling that maybe I’m moving on. Maybe.

I dont want to take drugs to make me feel happy. I want help from REAL people who are there for you without getting paid. Please tell me how i can be happy again. I know its personal, sorry for that. I've also considered suicide multiple times but never had the guts to do it. I think its a good thing that im a coward and i back away at the last moment. I used to self harm because at the moment of pure sadness and lonelyness, i transfer mental pain into physical pain. It helped but it left me with scars on my chest, arms, and legs.   But 1 month ago i cut so deep in my leg that it kinda ripped open (kind of like when you pull rubber on both sides and cut a hole in the middle, the puncture hole just expands) , i had to get 18 stitches, and that was the wake up call to stop harming. Im sorry i got carried away while typing. But please, dear reddit. Help me",20Sep2017,2
42,"I'm writing this because I have a really hard time enjoying things long-term. I think this is due to the fact that I'm suffering from depression and anxiety, but that's another thing. I'm currently in treatment and I'm also on a diet that should help both my physical and mental state. However, the symptoms are still there, and the most annoying and upsetting thing is that I am getting bored/tired of things very easily. Literally, I can no longer watch more than 3 episodes of a series, even if I really enjoy the series. I will find a new band and listen to their songs for a few days then I will no longer find them appealing. Even worse, this costed me a lot of friendships because I literally can't stand my friends anymore. I know it's a bad thing to say and feel, but it's the way I feel it. And it's upsetting, it really bothers me because I have kind and empathetic friends and it hurts when I am literally forced to turn my back on them because I don't enjoy their company anymore. It makes me feel like I'm a narcissist. I know I will be told to ""find new, exciting things"", but this can't go on forever. I can't just chase the feeling of novelty and excitement for the rest of my life, because this way I'm never going to be happy with what I already have, I will look for new things constantly and my life will be a complete gold rush. Is there perhaps a particular technique I could use to reignite my interest in the things I used to love once?",20Sep2017,3

48,"I am a 25 year old virgin and out of curiosity I decided to set my Tinder to women and men. I got male matches exclusively. So one guy started chatting and we made a plan to do stuff later today. Do stuff as in sexual stuff. The thing is I've really only ever been attracted to women. I'm not sure if I'm doing this out of desperation/sexual frustration, or a genuine desire to experiment. I don't know if I want to even show up. On one hand, I don't want to spend another evening at home by myself jerking off and browsing the web. But I also don't know if I'm ready to get physical with a guy. I have about 3 hours to decide. ",20Sep2017,9

54,"Fox News is the bellweather because they are the propaganda arm of any Republican presidency.  In the build up to Iraq, all media outlets let us down, but Fox did so with an enthusiasm that was hard to match.  Every day now you are seeing the stories about Little Kim committing horrors.

58,"Ex-girlfriends, former friends, current friends, family. I can't remember the last time I've had a dream where I've been happy. Every time, it's an ex saying they love me still, and I'll either wake up immediately because I know it's a dream, or I'll go with it until they tell me that they don't love me. Or it's a friend I've lost that explains why they dropped me, and we both move on. Or it's a current friend telling me I'm shit and they never liked me, and leaving me. It's almost every night.

And during the day, if I think about it, I know that I'll never care about those people again. I really really don't. I don't love any of my exes romantically, I don't miss any friends that have left me, so why do I dream about it every night? It kills me inside. It makes me feel like there's some part of me that can't let go of the past, but it's the only thing I want. I want to dream about weird things, things that scare me, things that make me happy. Not things that make me sad all the time. It's been going on very frequently for the past year, but it's happened infrequently for even longer than that. I want it to stop. I feel like one day, it'll just be too much",20Sep2017,1

61,"Today I decided to change my number! No, it wasn't because of a break up or a crazy ex calling me! It was because I've had it since I was 10 (I'm now 25)! Also all of my family members has the same last four digits! 🙄 I just didn't want the attachment anymore! Oh and another thing! ☝🏾It was tied to a bunch of telemarketing stuff and crap! I was getting a lot of nuisance calls! 

Changing my number feels like a fresh start! Only the people I want to have it, has it! Along with changing my number I changed my email! I had so many emails that turned into junk email because someone or something is always asking for a email! I updated my contact information for everything I have ! I'm telling y'all this is such a good feeling! I feel free! It's the little things! 🤗",20Sep2017,0
62,"So almost 100% sure im depressed, ive got all the symptoms that everyone talks about (sleeping way to much, still tired all day, cant even fall asleep without melatonin, no interest in the sports i used to play, anything that should be new and exciting is just 'meh', cant even get interested in sex which is weird since im usually overly interested in it, cant motivate myself to be as productive at work, dont really get excited about stuff, everything is kinda just numb, etc cuz im sure im forgetting something), but im pretty sure ive done everything i could possibly do to alleviate these symptoms. 

I lift weights for an hour 5x a week, i go to sleep at 930-10pm every night (thanks melatonin), ive cut almost all junk food out, the only thing thats not meat, fruit, veg, are those flavored waters from walmart, but no dairy, and no super processed foods. Ive also stopped smoking weed (ran out) and i havent really been drinking (absolutely no desire to go to the bars, even though i used to go every so often). I started setting weekly goals and have been meeting them pretty consistantly, and ive even been chatting with coworkers as much as i think is approproate without looking like im wasting time. My apt is clean, and im pretty steadily improving how its decorated and organized, and money isnt really to much of an issue for me anymore since ive got a solid job in a LCOL. I even stopped watching as much tv as i replaced it with reading/music (and not even really sad music, just some hip hop and alt stuff). 

What else can i do? My appointment is like 1mo out assuming nobody else cancels theirs. Is there some food that helps?? Does anyone recommend church (used to go, am catholic, but havent been in a while)?? Please give me some tips, or help or something i hate just feeling like im in this 'funk'.",20Sep2017,2
