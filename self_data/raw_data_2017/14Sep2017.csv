11,"First off, I would like to say this is a very negative post and also that I am speaking on behalf of being fortunate enough to be raised and living in a first world country. I apologize in advance if I offend anyone who has a had a tough life from the get go. It's not you're fault. You didn't choose this life.

Where to begin, ah let's start with not existing. You're a little tiny sperm just hanging out in someone's body when all of a sudden you become life. You weren't even ask if you wanted to come on earth and live. If I had the option to understand and be explained what I was signing up for before being born and placed on this earth to live, I would pass it in to the next sperm and say have at her. Because IM NOT INTERESTED. 

So you're born and you don't know shit until you're 3 or 4 years old. Then you become a little person, grow up and start realizing you have a life. Yeah being a child is fun. You have no responsibilities. You just hangout and everything is handed to you. Food, water, shelter and transportation. Everything is easy. 


Then you grow up and become an adult and have to smarten up and figure out a way to get through this thing called life. You need to find a good paying job in order to survive. You need money to pay for EVERYTHING. Your car to get around, maintenance and gas. Your house and all the upkeep and bills. A roof over your head and a bed to sleep in. Your food so you don't die of starvation. Your clothes so you're not walking around naked. 

Everything you need in life comes back to money. If you have it, you're good. If you don't, you're fucked and you're going to have a pretty miserable life. 

Life is so pointless. To get a decent job, not always the case but most of the time you need an education to get you that good paying job. Then you have to buy a home and buy a car and buy food and do this every single day. Every week. Every month. Every year until you die or until you life a successful enough life where you can retire at a late age and hope you can enjoy what little life you have left to live.  

You do all this work and then you die. 
You're stressed out finding a job and saving money. 
You die and you're gone. 
You eat, sleep, work and then die. 
You work so hard for everything and for what?
To just die and it all just be a huge waste of time. 


Life has no purpose. I did not ask to be placed on this earth to deal with all this bullshit. I do not want to be here nor will I ever create life and have them try and survive. 


I am in no way suicidal because that shit is scary and selfish.  I have family and friends who would
miss me dearly. But that's their problem. After I'm gone, I have no more problems. No responsibilities. I'm gone and everything just goes away. 

Anyway; off to sleep I go just to wake up, go to work and make money so I can survive in this fucking life. 
Rant over. Goodnight. 

Ps. I'm having a bad night and I'm in a bad mood. ",14Sep2017,1
12,"School sucks, it's truly terrible. I have amazing grades, and I got into three top classes, I should be happy right? I should be, but I'm not. I feel like people hate me. My only three friends and I have been drifting apart, and it's hurting me. It's hurting me so much. I love them, they're so great, but I feel like everyday they hate me more and more. I can tell they're annoyed by me. I might just stop talking in school (unless it's to teachers) at this point. No one even cares about that I have to say anyway, and my voice is annoying. 

My mom has been working long hours, and I barely get to see her. She usually comes home when I'm about to go to bed. As for my dad, he died when I was one. I sometimes cry because I don't have a father. I barely even got to know him, yet I still miss him. I have this hole in my life that will never be patched.  My older brother has been working a lot too, so I haven't seen him for two days. I'm barely even seeing my own family at home anymore. 

There's been a lot of drama in the Baby Einstein fan community, where one person in a (now deleted) YouTube video told me, ""Raichu (me) should drink bleach."" Another person in the video with them agreed and said, ""Yeah, that's what she should do."" They have no idea how much that hurts. It still hurts me, and that was two months ago. The comment is always in the back of my mind, it'll always hurt. It hurts so much. 

I've just been watching IHE and JAR Media now, they've helped me so much. IHE is my role model, I look up to him. My brother got me an IHE shirt for my birthday as well, and I even wore it to school today. I'm glad that they're on YouTube, I'm glad I've found them. I remember when IHE responded to three to my reddit posts, I was so happy. It made me feel like I had a place in this world. /r/IHE makes me feel like I belong somewhere, and it's great. I love everyone over at that subreddit and everyone at /r/JARMedia too. IHE is a fantastic person, thanks for making videos man. 

Last week in P.E someone on my basketball team said that they ""hated me."" They said it right out loud. I already know I'm pathetic, I already know I'm worthless, I already know that I'm stupid. I already know I'm annoying, I already know that no one wants me here, I already know that I'm 'edgy.' I already know that I should die. Thanks for clarifying that, I already feel broken anyway. 

Sorry that I like PAW Patrol, sorry that I like Baby Einstein, sorry that I like Pok√®mon,  sorry that I like Sesame Street, sorry that I like Octonauts. These shows make me happy, okay? Just because I like a show with talking police dogs that save people, nd just because I like collecting Baby Einstein DVDs and puppets doesn't make me stupid. So don't treat me like I am.  I should've never joined back in the Baby Einstein community in 2016, I never should've. I'm tearing the community apart. It's all my fault. 

Everything that is happening is my fault. If I never liked Baby Einstein, I'd have more friends, and I wouldn't be seen as ""the weird quiet person."" If I had learned to grow up. If I wasn't still watching my Baby Wordsworth DVD every weekend until I lost it two years ago, and if I wasn't still watching my Baby Van Gogh DVD at least once a week, then none of this would've happened. I took a hiatus from the community in 2014, but I've liked B.E since I was born. 

I wish life was perfect, but it sadly can't be that way. I wish I was less annoying and that I was more likeable. I wish I had at least one friend. 

Sorry for the long text reddit, I'm sorry that you had to read this. I'm sorry for annoying you. Thank you for reading if you made it this far. Reddit is great. 

Your (Kind of) Friend,

I don't even know that I could explain them in away that makes since.
Anyways I've bottled up this stuff for so long and I really need to get it all out. I don't know that it would make them any better or ease the pain, frustration, and confusion that they cause me. (Don't worry I'm not suicidal just tired of keeping everything to myself). I figured this would be a good place to really talk about the things that consume my thoughts out. Everything from sexual fantasies to why the hell do I keep making these mistakes could finally be put out there from my brain to the world and all the while I'd be able to hide behind my chromebook with the comforting knowledge that I was able to do it without people ever knowing who I personally am.
I couldn't do it though. There was to much and each one required to much detail to detail to convey what the particular issue was. It would take me weeks if not months to do it if I did it in one post.

16,"I live in Chicago and I was on the train home after rock climbing just reading a book and some drunk dude in a nice suit sat down beside me and started talking to me. I could barely understand him because his words were so slurred, but eventually he got around to disgustingly and explicitly asking me to give him a handjob. I was like ""nah man sorry that's not my scene"" (I'm a straight guy) and he seemed to be fine with that, so I assumed he was just clumsily tryna get his nut and couldn't really hold that against him. I kept listening to him slur indecipherably at me because he seemed reasonably nice, and eventually he asked to give his mom a call. I was pretty reluctant, but eventually I just let him because, like I said, he appeared to be an ok human, plus I was in a position that I could stop him if he tried to rush off the train with it or something. He called his mom, slurred at her for awhile, then hung up and asked to show me a song using my phone. He played it, played another, and soon enough my stop approached so I asked for my phone back (I actually had to pry it from his hands, which was when I went from sorta nervous to on full alert). As I was getting off he followed me and said he'd ""make sure I got home ok."" I told him I was fine and knew how to get back but he insisted and kept following me and I really couldn't do anything about it, so I just went to the bus stop to wait for the ride home (only one other person there unfortunately, and they were very clearly consciously distancing themselves from the situation) and he kept asking me to play songs for him (I dunno why the fuck I kept playing songs for him, it was pretty clearly just a tactic he was using to keep my phone out near him, I'm an idiot for that). At one point he suddenly grabbed my hand and put it on his cock and I was like,"" back the fuck up, not ok, don't touch me dude,"" and he apologized and I was fucking disgusted by him but I decided not to go anywhere because it was late at night and I didn't want to go walk the 10 or so blocks home through the south side of Chicago (out of the frying pan, into the fire). So, I just tried to keep my distance from him but he kept talking to me and staying pretty nearby. Eventually he kinda slid outta my sight for a second and popped me in the fucking jaw!! It was sort of a glancing blow because he had a bad angle, so luckily it didn't break anything or knock me out or even knock me to the ground, and I was able to quickly regain my balance and fucking sprint as fast as I could to a nearby gas station. He was drunk and had nice, uncomfortable shoes on so he gave up chasing me quickly and went the opposite direction. I called the police to file a report, called my friend to pick me up, and now here I am, unable to sleep, replaying this jarring sequence of events in my head over and over again. I'm so fucking grateful I made it out of that situation fully intact (except for a slightly sore jaw). I'm an extremely trusting individual, and assuming the best of people has never really backfired on me like this before. I'm fucking shook. Thanks for reading, don't be afraid to disengage with people that give you weird vibes, and if they make you touch their cocks against your explicit wishes, just fucking run away, fuck ",14Sep2017,2

19,"It's been a little over a year since my house caught on fire. There was no home insurance and it has been a struggle to repair the damage. The stress of making phone calls after phone calls with no help. No real Family to help either since we're not close. In the beginning there was dark thoughts running through my head but I knew I had to get rid of them. For the sake of my son and family that were living there to all be together again in that house. But right when I think I'm taking a step forward I get knocked down two steps back. The other problems that arise is just getting out of hand and add on to the stress I already have. I just hope that things will get better but they don't. How can a family go through so many problems in much a little time. It doesn't make sense. We had our problems before but we kept to ourselves. I'll admit I blamed God and that was wrong of me to do even though I'm not to religious. I guess I seek answers from Him without knowing really anything about Him. I never put any time into all of that. Does that make me bad? All I want is to have peace again with my family and my son. It feels like a never ending story of problems and stress. I wake up every morning thinking I wonder what other shit will happen today. It just never fails. Another phone call of something else bad that I gotta fix. I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I see black, a black that just keeps going. I try my best to keep my head up and put on a smile for my friends and tell them I'm alright.

20,"Okay, to be real, people didn't date in their thirtieth year before 1980. Gender roles were still the norm. A man marries a woman, supports her, she has his children. That's the story. That has always been the story. We started challenging that story in small doses after sexual revolution in the 1960s. New family concepts started to arise. Now, in 2017, after we've revolutionized when people have kids (when they decide to) and if they have kids (if they didn't accidentally) Family dynamics are all over the place in a world where divorce and remarriage are the norm; Unheard of in our grandparents time. Where, if a woman gets pregnant, she's not automatically stapled to the life of mother she can pursue her independence like only men could in history before her. In a world where a man can openly love another man and a women can love a womn and a couple can touch other person and person can date people and LGBTQTA++++++ . Here we are. Mostly, still, man and woman have kids young, by 25.

 If you're older than 25 and single, you're city. No one is over 25  single anywhere else unless they are divorced or something else crazy has happened or they're agoraphobic or something else bad luck life. In the city, 25+ single is still empowerment. So many sexy singles to fuck. Crazy romantic adventures. 

30+ dating is very different. When people find out your age they expect you to be trying to settle them into your life. Or, you have seen their traits in others you have dated in the past and write them off. Shit son, it is near impossible to impress me on a first date now. When I was twenty buying me dinner was unheard of I would think you were the most generous person ever. Now that means nothing that I know every single man will pay, they will INSIST on paying like their whole pride rides on it. Okay. Pay then. Whatever. That doesn't impress me and in fact it almost makes me worried that you'll want to perpetuate gender roles (if you pay for everything what are you expecting me to do for you?) 

Okay so you're asking me out. You have just gotten out of a major relationship. Or, you're in a relationship you're trying to cheat on her. Or, you're in a relationship the two of you want me to explore being your sexual accessory.

22,"So I've never used reddit...I made this account to only post this.

About 3-4 years ago I was out of country on a trip and the hotel I was staying at had a balcony overlooking a street. My room was only on the third floor so I could make out the people on the street somewhat well.

I couldn't sleep one night and went out on the balcony, then I noticed this guy staring up at me from the sidewalk. He was wearing a dark puffy trench coat type of thing and kind of a shortish sort of top hat. He looked right at me for a few moments, smiled, then walked away. It wasn't exactly a friendly smile, but more of a slight devilish grin.

I didn't think much of it but fast forward to just the other day, I was over at my parents' house and my sister (she's 9) was drawing something in her book. I walk past and catch a glimpse of what she was drawing. It took me a moment to realize but it was a figure that looked exactly like the guy who smiled at me. It was poorly drawn but I could easily make out key features like the clothing which matched exactly...same face shape as well, everything was just the same.

I asked her about it and she told me he was in a dream she had the night prior. I asked her what happened in the dream and she described exactly what had happened when I was at the hotel: he stared, smiled, and walked away.

29,"Let's start things off with an ideal:

The reputation of the US was built upon the ideal of freedom; of liberty. Foreigners and natives alike were taught that this is what the US believed in. It was preached for a long time but I don't hear it being preached anymore. But the thing is, I still believe in freedom as an ideal.

I still believe that each sentient being is entitled to a lack of innate restrictions based on any particular characteristic of ""what"" they are. I believe that a person is who they make themself after discovering that they have room to grow. I believe that a nation which touts the banner of freedom has a responsibility to teach its people not just ""you can be anything you want"" but ""here are the fundamental mental tools that any person needs to thwart man-made obstacles that may impede your freedom as you seek to pursue it"". I believe that a nation such as this, which has gone to such lengths to spread such an image of itself should put its money where its mouth is and not just teach patriotism but individualism! Because what is a person if they are not free? What is a miner who knows not the options of his toil; to know that striking the earth isn't all that there is or that of all the things they could have, this is what they already wanted?

The birthplace of freedom should birth freedom in the place of former domineers. No longer should we be bound to the wills of people who serve no will of their own! Nor should any person be taught to seek bondage unless it's what they truly desire! All options should not only be on the table but known! 

In a nation which supposedly favors freedom, now should be a time of great excitement! Now should be when we look to the prospects of the future; at the immense bounty of the automatic age and see the possibilities of our people as innovators!

[And that right there is the proof. No matter what I talk about, I get caught up in it and become this speaker of ridiculous motivation. I end up getting this idea that anyone else could be as easily riled as myself. Oh, well. I wish there was something I could do with this. I mean, I could probably motivate some people for temporary bursts of time but eventually, when nothing happens, they'd look to my words and find that when they shine white in a pale light, other similar words would look the same. All I'd end up doing is hurting the cause by talking big words without action.]

31,"Typing during lunch hour. I need help reflecting on this.


I was friends with Steve since high school. We were really tight back then to the point people would joke we'd make a good couple. We both ended up going to the same university, but due to differences in who we chose to hang out with, we slowly drifted apart. By senior year, we probably only hung out a handful of times.


When he graduated, he moved to another state for 2 years. We stopped speaking pretty much after that, but about 2 years ago, he came back to my city. He ended up getting a job 10 minutes from where I work and would text/FB message me probably once or twice a month to see if we could grab lunch together. Looking back on it, I always gave the excuse that I was always swamped with work or had other obligations. Looking back on it, I don't think I even made the first move to ask if he wanted to grab lunch.


I don't know why I did this. I mean, if it was my boyfriend or a close friend, I would make time for them during the work week or weekend. Yeah I work a pretty intensive job that keeps me busy, but now I feel like I neglected him, just because I didn't know him as much as I used to.

A couple of weeks ago, he was killed in a hit and run. I went to his funeral, gave myself time to grieve, but I still feel like shit and can't get this unknown nagging feeling out of my head. When I was confided to a friend about how I was feeling, she essentially called me a ""douche"" for always making excuses to avoid him and that the guilt I was feeling was ""selfish"" in nature, because I chose to not hang out with him, and now I was looking for some sympathy.


I guess I'm all sorts of confused. I've had that vibe of ""You don't know what you got until it's gone"" for the past few weeks, and I really regret not seeing him once in the past two years. Looking back on it, I feel like I could've easily found time if I really wanted to.

So I go to a private high school in New York and have just gotten through my first 5 days of junior year. It's been hell. My teachers don't teach, they just lecture off arbitrary facts and supposedly teach us ""methods"" to do stuff. I got a 56 on my first test in English, a class I've always been good in. They assign us ludicrous amounts of homework ever night. Usually 4-5 hours of long assignments and 1-3 less than 30 minutes assignments. We use tech in our classes and the Wi Fi barely works, I can't download half my textbooks, and I have no energy, drive, or motivation to do anything. One day I came home and sat for 2 hours playing with a toy at my desk, when I could've done some actually fun things (Gaming, Reading, Watching Netflix) even though I should've been doing my homework.

I have a law degree, soon to have an LLM, and am a trained barrister in commercial and chancery law. Part of me is excited to represent these kind of people, knowing how they treat those who they consider beneath them - myself included; a big part of me hopes I smile at those I see wearing whatever the fuck they want, no matter the socio-economic expectations of the area, regardless of the socio-economic position I find myself in. I hate people, I hope they change. ",14Sep2017,7
40,"Jason,

I thought you were pretty fucking perfect for me. Smart, fun, kinky, bi...all the things I like. 

It's been a long time since we talked, maybe even two years.  I don't even know but I met you at a time when I was wondering if anyone was going to want me again.  I was newly divorced and not sure what the future held for me and we started talking and it was just what I needed.  

I loved texting you and giving you hard-ons while you were out with your friends.  I loved that you couldn't wait until you got home and the sex was fucking awesome.  It was the first time I didn't mind submitting.  The first time I didn't want to be the top.  And even though it never happened the thought of seeing you fucking a guy while he's fucking me....damn.  You were perfect.  

But there came a time when I wanted more than the sex and you peaced out.  Which is understandable.  You didn't sign up for that.  

I cleaned out my phone the other day and realized you were still in there.  You were still in my kik too.  So I removed you from both, which is why you came to mind randomly as I'm working.

Thanks for giving me a boost when I needed it back then.  I'm sure all is well for you and I hope it is.

Cheers,

41,"It's hard to precisely define happiness. If I define it as something, I may experience other forms of good feelings which are outside of the definition. So all I can really say is that it's a complex composite phenomenon.

Though there is one key measure of happiness for me: the feelings I experience in connection with my perception of the present moment in the world around me. This is probably more important than the internal feelings associated with ""I"", because those are mostly the result of thought drama.

Those external world feelings are also more difficult to affect. Like the internal ""I"" feelings can be changed by different focuses, like for example escapist excitement about something. But the external feelings are a lot more stable. They make a huge difference in my enjoyment and quality of life and improvements are associated with diverse benefits like improved motivation.

Sometimes I get flashes of memories of how the world felt better during my childhood. Those can be *extremely* impressive. Some mundane scenes felt so good that it's far beyond my enjoyment of anything now. I wish I could go back to feeling that way. ",14Sep2017,1
42,"I am an adult man, a university graduate, but on many milestones and character traits I am behind the curve.

For over a year I have been moldering in my family home. I have held no jobs in my life, but I lack any skills, qualifications, or experiences toward any occupation, whether it be strength and endurance (I am very weak and unfit), sociability (No), technical knowledge (none)...and for any menial position in the service industry, I lack those native talents that are the understood minimum to perform their duties. I lack the discipline or motivation for diligence. Mentally and physically, I am excruciatingly slow. I have great difficulty learning anything, much less applying or doing it. In particular, my visual and spatial cognition is at a low level, despite lacking any formal impairment. I'm not good with words in speaking, writing, or reading, and if you think you have come to a different impression let me point out that this is my inflexible pinnacle, and this is just rambling about personal shit, not an essay or a literary work. 

All these things I claim to lack also apply to the mundane aspects of living, where I have never had to maintain my own finances or be familiar with the corresponding structures, I do not know the basic mechanics of household systems nor how to maintain them, I have never used my hands to make or fix something for myself, I can't cook beyond ""boil/fry ingredients to safety"", I do not know how to shop for my own provisions and necessities, and I am barely able to maintain personal hygiene (my skin and teeth have been in terrible condition for a long time). In other words, I have no experience with or preparation for survival. 

My immediate family is not able to support my development other than materially *(again, I've always lived ""at home"")*. I have pursued a variety of mental health services for some years, and am currently, but these haven't proved helpful in any way. The Labor Dept. reps and social workers in my city pointed out that I need myself sorted for their services to be of any use. I have no friends or acquaintances to rely on. I have no interests or hobbies to motivate myself with or to develop. 

And worst of all, I don't really care about any of it more than superficially. I don't have any ambitions our outlook, or anything I want to see or do in the future. There's nothing I want to achieve for myself or for anyone else. I don't have any commitment to life. I don't want to deal with subsistence or people or myself. There's nothing I want out of life, and I wouldn't mind dying, though I don't have enough drive or self-efficacy to consider suicide an option. If it weren't for my family making existence relatively easy, I would do nothing to avert my own death by neglect. **So far I have spent my time anesthetizing myself on the Internet/computer, flitting between activities I least dislike at any given moment.**

**And I've always been like this, but in my hedonistic youth I figured everything would sort itself out in its own time. It's just more visible and urgent than ever, because of my life-stage.**

**So most generally my question is, what do I do?**

Here's a more specific question on something I'd like help with, and it should illustrate some of my deficits. Would it be possible to find free communal/volunteer support to assist me on learning the following skills, and if so what advice or suggestions do you have? 

For example: 

*tying shoelaces

*tucking and wearing collared shirts, pants

*wearing belts

*ironing clothes

*folding clothes

**Edit**: For the questions at the bottom of my post, I've already considered watching videos online. The problem is that I don't know what I'm looking at. ",14Sep2017,2

45,"Been watching the news during the last two hurricanes, lots of discussion about people who don't leave despite a mandatory evacuation. 

Several days after the hurricane the police and other officials are still not letting the evacuees return to assess their damage. Yet the people who stayed and rode it out are getting to work cleaning up and rebuilding. If I was one of those people being kept out this long after the storm I would be so frustrated and upset. 

Of course the mantra is 'It' not safe, there is no electricity or running water.""

People lived for tens of thousands of years without electricity or running water. Yes there is some increased risk, but if I lived in an evacuation zone I would certainly consider that if I left I might not be allowed to return for days or even weeks. I would bet my bottom dollar that this played into a lot of peoples decision to stay.

46,"Ok so I'm not sure what to do anymore and really need help from you guys. Girlfriend of 3 years has been getting depressed and it's Getting worse last night she tried to cut herself. 

When we hangout she's happy but when I leave I'm always getting upset phone calls. She tells me I'm the only thing that makes her truly happy. 

My problem is I just don't know how to help her, every time I give advice I sound like a broken record, either I need better advice or she needs more than advice

Background on Her two problems 

1) body insecurity. Would love female opinion because I know a ton of females have this issue too. Yes she is attractive but constantly compares herself to others, and very often she will get into a bad thought pattern or see some advertisement on social media with some perfect 10 girl, and that makes her upset and completely throws off her day where she doesn't feel like doing anything productive 

2). Being lost in her career. She is 21, just left college because she doesn't know what major she wants so is wasting time. She is very unique, she's not the kind of girl that would sit in an office or work at Starbucks, she's very creative and unconventially talented (great at things like writing etc) which makes it really hard to find your place in college and in the convential world. What makes this harder is everybody around her in her family is the opposite, all tell her go to college, get a normal job  just  stupid shit that shows they clearly don't know a thing about her. 

She's very smart but can't find her place or just where to start. Sitting around all day not doing anything just makes her problems 10x worse because she is left with her thoughts all day. I feel if she found a job that fulfilled her or found a tangible way to start making money writing or doing what she loves, she would feel more confident and positive, and probably the body insecurities would set themselves aside, I believe the main cause of her depression around that issue is the fact she sits around all day and is stuck in her thoughts.

I've told her to find something to do right now to make money because it will improve her self worth and at least get her out of bed and feeling productive, and even if it's a meaningless job as a waitress just consider it a stepping stone into your next thing. She only wants to do what she's passionate about but can't find any one to pay her. Currently she works once a week as an art model but that leaves way too much free time and little income.


What can I do to help her ? What advice do any of you have about either of the issues she's having? Many thanks Reddit! 

Also, have any  been in same situation with significant other ? As shitty as it sounds there are some times where I almost don't want to hangout with her because Sometimes the whole time is spent listening to her sob and talk about problems the whole time and even brings down my mood ...  I still be there for her all the time because obviously now she needs me more than ever but sometimes I feel like her issues put a huge weight on me and our relationship 

Thanks everybody ",14Sep2017,5
47,"I started a new school to try and make friends, I did, but they're all rejects. I lift weights to try and be cool and get girls but all the cool people don't like me and I've only had one girlfriend. I like a blonde girl with black eyebrows but I'm too scared to admit it to myself because I've only known her a week and I don't want to scare her off. I'm aiming to go to oxbridge but I know full well I won't. My mum is a mess but antidepressants and counsellors make her think she isn't. My sister is off at university and I don't miss her. I look ugly a hell and wish I didn't. I'm really insecure but I pretend I'm not. I secretly hate everyone but I act social to try and get friends. I want to die in a car crash, or more specifically on my bus on my way to school - not suicide because 1) I don't have the balls and 2) it looks cowardly. I cry a few times every week but I try come across as emotionally stable. I want people to accept me but again I really just hate them all. I think I'm better than people when I'm not. I mess everything up; relationships mainly. Oh, and my life. I'm too scared to be myself so I pretend to be somebody I'm not and even that doesn't make people like me.

48,"17 and found out I have ASD about 4 weeks ago. Still can't wrap my head around it. My diagnosis was described as 'high-functioning' but not far enough on the spectrum for an Asperger diagnosis, which I don't quite understand.

Either way, I've spent 2 months in a mental health hospital and I feel more alone than ever. I had goals and ambitions of art and storytelling and a little art studio with a seafront view; I'm clawing at those, they're my life line, but my nails are getting filed down and it's harder and harder to hold on. Not sure where that came from, that sounds dumb.

I feel I have no potential and nothing to offer to the world. No matter how many times I'm told otherwise, that mindset won't change. They don't mean it, I say, they're saying that out of pity, I'm being a burden to them by making them have to say that. Useless, worthless, talentless, unintelligent, and now I also found out I'm different since I have autism.

I really want to die, but I don't deserve to be selfish enough to leave my family to fend for themselves. I should save up for getting licenses to be a truck driver. Seems perfect for me, long road trips all alone, not talking to anyone for days, and the pay's decent enough to support my family. I have no one I can freely talk to so I'm writing this and chucking it into the void. My chest already feels a little lighter. Like writing a note in a glass bottle and chucking it in the sea. That also sounded dumb. Not sure what it is with me and awful analogies, I think it might be me wanting to base my emotions on something more physical to understand them better. Perhaps it's part of my autism.

52,"So, Im not religious, and while I dont HATE religion I dont particularly like it. Rather than be a Dawkins-esque edge lord I try to be respectful of other peoples beliefs, but I also dont shy away from making my own views on stuff known... Which can be hard.

So... How could I avoid being a dick and outright dismissing somebodies world view in this scenario?

So, talking about the ethics of eating meat and killing animals my view tends towards the idea that killing things unessessarily may not be ethical. I still eat meat, but I can acknowledge we dont NEED to. Which makes me a hypocrite.

A good friend of mine who is pretty religious said that god put animals on the Earth and made us their masters- Meaning what we do with animals is up to us. Including hurting them.

So... How would I win this dude to my side without outright saying that their religion is full of shit. He genuinely believes his god wants this for us, and that means there's no arguing it. God's word is law. Any argument I could give here would be sans the religious slant- So it wont work because that's not how belief works. But I cant in good faith argue that perhaps their god is wrong, when I dont think his god is real in the first place.

Just wanted to see what others think. Im fully expecting some edge lord responses, which is fine. I tend to try to delegate with people rather than attack them but this is just one example of something there can be no compromise on.

Another example might be the abortion debate. How can there EVER be a compromise when one side views abortion as ACTUAL MURDER. How can you meet in the middle with that on the table? You'd have to convince them that their ENTIRE WORLDVIEW is wrong!",14Sep2017,1

But I saw it on a very limited scale myself during Hurricane Irma. I live in the Florida Panhandle which was much less affected than the rest of the state. I know lots of people who were complaining about Irma evacuees taking all the gas and water as they passed through town; at one point you couldn't find gas in 90+ percent of stations in the county. And some of their comments were racially-laced too after some Latino kids from Miami were caught stealing from the local stores. Some people also stepped up to help those in shelters too - don't get me wrong - but the fact that an ""us versus them"" feeling was noticeable at all was troubling.

56,"Besides a reason for getting together with your friends and family, what is the fascination with and the reason for watching a football game?

I understand the athleticism and discipline needed for the sport is great, as with any other sport, but I don't understand the attraction.

To me, the game is boring. I went to a home opener for my college because a friend had extra tickets. We tailgated for 3 hours (thats always fun: friends, food, alcohol, etc.), but then we sat in the stands for 4 hours; most of it waiting for plays to actually happen. All the while enduring people complaining about bad plays or drunk people cussing at the opposing team's fans whose section happened to be near us.

If the game were more continuous like basketball or soccer, and end sooner, I think it would be far more exciting. I would venture a guess that there was 15 minutes of actual play time in the 4 hours. Is that just because of the rules of the game?
