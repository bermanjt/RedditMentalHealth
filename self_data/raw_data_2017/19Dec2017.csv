1,"She says she gets multiple calls a day from similar numbers to hers. So do I... but neither of us thought our numbers were being hijacked somehow. And for what? 

EDIT: OK. The number called me again, and this time I answered. It was ringing, and then her voicemail answered. I left a message. What would anyone or even a phone scam have to gain? I am even more freaked out, now. She is even more so, since she ""initiated"". We are currently texting about it. 

Any help or shared experience would be much appreciated. Let's make some noise about this, because it must be happening on a larger scale.",19Dec2017,7
2,"I developed epilepsy a few years ago and it fucked me up. I was in school and my grades dropped from a 3.6 GPA to 2.4. I got on medication that eventually stopped the seizures but made me very depressed and during the spring 2016 school semester I became extremely suicidal. I didn't pay for school with my student loan money and instead used it to sit around at home putting a belt around my neck hoping I would get the courage to tighten it up enough to end my life. I took out a life insurance policy so that I could trigger a seizure in myself while driving on the highway and give my parents enough money to pay off my student loans. The only thing that stopped me was not wanting to kill myself without knowing my dog would be in good hands.

I ended up seeing a school therapist and was able to make some massive changes in my life to pull myself out of the depression. I still owed my school $5,000 and realized that I could not pay it, so I told my parents that I would be able to get the job I wanted without finishing my degree. They were upset because I only had one semester left to go, but they trusted me and believed me.  

I could not get the job I wanted. I couldn't get anything close to it. I had another seizure in a crowded mall parking lot and 50+ people watched me shake and convulse on the ground for 10-15 minutes as paramedics and fire trucks blocked traffic to surround me and put me on a stretcher. I don't remember any of it except for waking up in the back of an ambulance believing I was teaching at an elementary school, which is what I had had been getting my degree for. I thought I was demonstrating how a breathing mask worked to one of my students when everything slowly fizzled away and a paramedic was pulling my hands down and telling me that I just had a grand mal seizure and most likely a concussion. I realized what happened, nodded my head and just started to cry. I didn't have my insurance with me, and after I left I never answered any calls or mail from the hospital, getting myself into more unnecessary debt. 

I pretended everything was OK even though I died inside. I started buying and abusing adderall so that I could appear happy at my summer job and around friends while I isolated myself more and more. I stopped cleaning, I stopped going to the gym, and I didn't take care of any of my responsibilities. I went into my school year job a mess and let it affect my work. I realized that I was not being the person I should be for the students and convinced myself to put in my two weeks notice to focus on my web design business. Right after that, I had a financial hardship that wiped out most of my savings. 

It's one week until Christmas and I'm 18 days late on rent. I have no money and I can not buy anyone in my family Christmas presents. My student loans started to be due 2 days ago and I can not pay them. My parents think I am going to go back to school next semester and I don't know what to say to them. I have bill collectors calling me constantly. I don't have friends outside of the job I just left. I don't take my dog out enough. I'm watching everyone graduate and I feel like a failure. Everything in the life that I thought I would be living is gone and I feel like the only thing left to get rid of is me. I don't know what to do with myself. I'm afraid of getting evicted. I'm afraid my parents will find out their son is a loser who has been lying to them for the past year.

I just want to be able to breath. I want to be able to wake up and have a normal day. I want to be able to sign up for classes and go to them and get my degree and get the job I wanted. I want to get my family Christmas presents and surprise them and make them happy. I don't know what to do.",19Dec2017,220
4,"My new manager is an insecure, lazy, worthless piece of shit who will abandon his employees to pursue his own personal interested without a taking a breath. I've decided that I'm going to call in sick tomorrow to show my value. The reason I am choosing tomorrow is because tomorrow is the  monthly managers meeting he is forced to attend. He only scheduled me and one other employee to open. This is a major inconvenience for him. Without me tomorrow shit will hit the fan. I've only ever called out once in 3 years and have not used any of the sick time I've accumulated this year.

10,"It seems I just have the worst luck when it comes to romance in my adolescence. Been rejected twice, accepted once only to find out I was being used as some sort of sexual outlet since his girlfriend at the time wouldn't have sex with him, and lately given hope that I just might have a normal, romantic relationship with a guy then watched it crash n' burn when he tells me he practically wiped out his own emotions and personality. He doesn't dislike me at all even after I confessed but doesn't ""love"" me as a potential partner or friend. 
I just hate looking at the happy couples at school and around the neighborhood and how normal and perfect they look. I try not to be jealous but seeing it all the time (especially on my friend's FB timeline where he constantly shows his love and adoration for his girlfriend to the point where I'm repulsed by him) is just too much. I want to cry b/c I miss having that feeling of being in real love and knowing someone genuinely loves me. The gentle kisses and hugs and fun dates.

23,"My mom's not that good with computers. Just basic internet surfing is all she does. So she has no interest in video games except spider solitaire. She been playing it for over 10 years ever since windows XP. It's a nice pastime for her and lets her meditate. 

But one day I see her playing an ad-laden crappy browser version so I ask her what's up. She says after the big update (from windows 7 to 10) she can't find it on her laptop. Indeed, all the default windows games are gone. Ok, I download the windows 7 version off the internet and install it for her and she's happy. 

A few months ago I had to reinstall it because it magically disappeared after an update. 


And now yesterday I find her sad, so she tells me her laptop had an update, and her spider solitaire is again gone. 

Yo Microsoft I don't know what tiny legal print in Windows 10 lets you think that its okay to mess with people's PCs and I certainly don't know how completely deleting people's programs constitutes as an ""update"", but I would really really appreciate it if you would just let my mother play spider solitaire in peace.

24,"He's a good friend but he's depression lately has turned him into an idiot. He seems to be in a toxic relationship as every time he talks about it, he's complaining about her and her messed up issues. He wont leave the relationship because he doesn't think he can do better, doesn't believe anyone could ever want him. I find that attitude very offensive towards his girlfriend.

He keeps making everything about him right now. He has noticed that I tend to keep my arms folded the last few months (in general, not just with him), and asked if it's something that he's done. There was something else that I did, don't remember what but he asked if it was about him. It wasn't.

He sent me a massive document detailing all of his lifes problems. He's said lately that everything is getting on top of him, which is fair. He needed to write it down because there is a lot. But everything he's written has a solution, it just requires work. He seems unwilling to actually do anything.

He's lonely, but his attitude towards people is awful. He's very negative, puts them down constantly and never makes an attempt to ask them about their day. Then he mentioned that I'm always happy around other people and joke around with them, but with him I can become miserable.

I've explained all my reasons to him as honestly as possible. I used to be nice about it, but that doesn't get through to him. I feel like his attitude is shit, I may just have to be upfront and say that to him soon.

I used to be really supportive. But the more I get to know him, the more my opinion of him just drops. He never used to be this bad. He's a smart guy, it sucks to see him go this way.

29,"When was the last time we had something go viral? When was the last fad? Why are there no more new memes? There's been one that I'm aware of in six months. No new TV shows that become talked about on the internet. Stranger Things was the last new one and that was last year. Rick and Morty started to become popular early this year but then it died down very quickly.

You guys remember when there'd be stupid shit that would get popular and we'd all get sick of hearing about it? Why is that not happening anymore? There used to be some new wild thing every other day! There was constantly something new in our culture. Have you not noticed that's changed?

There's been no new apps that got popular either. And no new consumer tech that made it big. No new subcultures. No new cultural phenomenona. No new anything.

Our culture has died. It's been about half a year since it happened and it was dying before that.

And there's no controversy when there should be. A man named Daniel Shaver was executed by police. They made him crawl on the ground for no wearing basketball shorts and when they started to fall down and he went to pull them back up, they shot him. The cops got away with it. A few people spoke up but there should have been mass outrage. It's not because he's white either. The alt-right should have been going on about it saying ""white people get killed just as much as blacks, why isn't BLM doing anything, etc."" And then people would argue against that, you know how it's supposed to go. There was no protesting about the repeal of Net Neutrality that I heard of. As many people cared about that, there should have been some uproar. Maybe not a lot, but there was absolutely nothing. Remember how much people protested when Trump got elected? There's not been any new controversy of the week for a long time. There was a bombing in New York a week ago, by the way. It was a Bangladeshi guy. None of the usual debate and arguing about Islam being violent. After the Vegas and Texas shootings, there should have been the usual back and forth about gun violence and mental health. There was a little discussion but not as much as there should have been. The Trump administration straight up banned the CDC and other agencies from using certain words and all people did was complain in the comments on the articles without much emotion.

I have it set up so I get emailed when a bill moves through the house or senate. I used to get several a week, now I don't get any. They've done nothing on health care and it's been a year. There's the tax bill, yes, but what else have they done? Congress has quit doing anything at all.

And why are our troublemakers not making trouble? Please don't think I'm saying that any of those women in #metoo should have been harassed or bothered, but you know that the alt-right would have made their lives a living hell last year. They should be spreading their hate and advancing their cause, but they're not. They were in the beginning of the year, what changed? Yes, there are a few that do but not as many as there would be if there wasn't something fucked up going on. Any movement that grows like they have and holds the views they do should not be so quiet. I'm not saying I support them in any way, but it's highly irregular they're not more of a problem. There was a growing pattern of violence at their events that just stopped. There has also not been the backlash against them that there should have been. The social justice crowd should be going apeshit.

We have been made docile. We have been made complacent. Our creativity and our passion has been stolen from us. I want to know why. We need to demand an answer. I'm not even saying that it's happened intentionally. Maybe there's some additive in our food that they didn't know had a psychoactive effect. I don't know, but we need to find out. Is it too late?

I think it might be something in our food, because I started noticing I didn't enjoy things as much and had no passion anymore in late spring/early summer. It got worse and worse until I was doing nothing but mindlessly reading AskReddit threads all day. And then I got where I wasn't eating a lot, and what do you know, I started thinking about things. Started generating idea after idea. Then I got back to eating normally and it went away. I had two days off in a row last week and I was thinking a lot, making theories about memetics and stuff. I did eat but I didn't eat anything processed. Then I went back to work and ate my meal, and after that I was back to being dumbed down. I know one anecdote isn't evidence but it's enough of a pattern for me to notice.

Please, please, read this and think about it. Have you noticed a change in yourself since about June? Have you noticed what I've noticed about no new cultural phenomena, no new fads, no new ideas?

Quit eating processed food. Don't eat meat unless you kill it yourself. Eggs should be safe, so are most fruits and vegetables. If it's something that you could tell if it's been tampered with, then it's probably safe.
And for the love of God, make noise about this. Copy and paste this post or write about it in your own words. Make people aware. Not just people on Reddit either. Go to sites that are majority other races, go to sites that have a majority of teenagers, put it on voat, put it on religious sites, put this everywhere. Put it in the comments on porn sites too, you'll reach a wider range of people there. And then we need to get off the computer or phone, and we need to raise hell. Protest until the truth is revealed. Boycott all producers of processed food. We need to get good food to food deserts too. Please for the love of God, don't let it be too late.",19Dec2017,4

36,"Hi reddit guys and girls!

So, I'll make it as short as possible.

In 8th grade I liked this girl, I talked to her for a few months and when I finally told her that I like her she was already with someone else.

Then, a year and a half later, I met this other girl and the same thing kind of happened.

During high school, whenever I liked a girl, I was just trying to get over it, thinking that the same will happen. And that's how I lived until a year ago.

A year ago I got my first gf (we didn't have sex). So yeah...
In october she left me because we haven't seen each other in 3 months due to summer vacation. That's when things started to change for me, a little.

Now, my problem is that I don't seem to like anyone. That toxic thinking I had in high school (not to like anyone anymore) isn't there anymore, but I still don't seem to like any girl at all...I mean I just think ""oh, she's cute"" and that's it. 

With this first gf it was different, it happened in 2 months or something like that.

I also am on nofap (2 weeks and counting), I'm trying to eat healthier and more (I weigh 54kg), I exercise and I hang out more. I also read self-improvement books, take better care of myself, got new clothes.

So, help me...I really want to be able to be...normal again.
I know there are people who can relate...I hope.

So please don't ignore me...

38,"Christmas used to be my mother's favourite holidays; she would put up the tree, cook great dinners, gift us with great presents... Until she died the summer of 2015. As an 18 yo I took it upon myself to try and keep the Christmas spirit alive, thinking for months about what to give my brother and father, only to receive an afterthought present. I know, you give presents because you want, but still, it hurts to receive some socks and a pajamas two years straight, like they don't even want to celebrate Christmas. This year though, the mere thought of having to put up the tree and decorate it makes me want to throw up or drown myself in alcohol.

40,"Hello, I’m a 24-year-old man. I think I'm very open minded and curious person and I'm constantly searching for truth and the best explanation. The more I think about myself the more I realize I don't really know who I am. I ask myself why do I like the things I like, what defines me, what do I really want in life, what makes me happy, what do I want from my relationships. I'm questioning my motives and trying to figure out how my subconsciousness work. Lately I realized the answers I give myself for the same question change quite often because of my momentary mood or after being influenced by other people. 
It’s almost the end of the year again. Yesterday I've seen pictures of myself from January and I was surprised how my body changed thanks to a healthy diet and exercise. Yet I see myself in the mirror every day and my body always looks the same as it did the day before. When I saw my old photo I was truly shocked. Was I really so overweight a year ago? I couldn’t believe it.
Today I thought: If I didn’t notice changes happening to my body would I notice any changes of my mind? How different is my perception of the world and myself than it was a year ago? How do I know it if there are no pictures of my mind from a year ago?
I think I should write a diary. But not an ordinary diary where you describe in details how you spend your time. I need a diary where I don’t describe events that happened to me but my own thoughts and feelings I had that day. What made me feel the way I felt and what made me think what I thought. Like a letter to my future self. Maybe a year from now he’ll be as much surprised about the mental progress as I’m surprised about my fitness progress today.

What do you think about this idea? Have you ever written such a diary? Did it help you realize anything?
It will contain my deepest and most personal thoughts, feelings and desires including the darkest parts of my mind no one but me should ever see. How do you keep such a diary from other people?",19Dec2017,1
42,I started working part-time at a small market about 3 months ago. I began working there because I was bored/lonely with my other job and wanted to try something new. I picked up on some things there quickly but I’m no rockstar in customer service - and I’m not getting along with most of my fellow employees/managers because of my lack of cs experience and my not so great social skills. I wanted this job to work out so I could be more social but I just don’t think it’s the right fit for me. I’m also finding it very stressful (especially this time of year) to make my schedule work between my two jobs. They both need me because they are both short-handed but I’m more loyal to my other job as I’ve been there a lot longer. So between just not really liking the new job and the scheduling I’ve decided I want to quit. I want to do this without giving my 2 weeks notice because my other job needs me more (and will give me full time again) and because I think it’ll be awkward staying with the market after giving notice. So what should I do? Quit without doing the 2 weeks or quit and very awkwardly stay there for those 2 weeks?,19Dec2017,2
44,"First semester was basically an extended summer for me. Started off good, was doing well in my classes for the most part, until I realized how much I hated college. Stopped going to classes, smoked weed with my friends like I had already been doing not worrying about school at all. 

Met a girl, she was nice and fun to hangout with. Started dating and two weeks in she dumped me for another guy she was talking to after we had met, what a short relationship that was. 

My best friend is moving cities in 3 weeks and I told him and my parents I wanted to go after this next semester. His grades were failing but he picked himself back up and now he is transferring. I ended up with a straight 0 GPA this semester and need a 4.0 to get the GPA in order to transfer to the college my best friend is going to. Also got put on academic probation so if I don’t meet a 2.0 next semester I’ll be kicked out of college. 

Amidst all of this, I caught a possession charge by agreeing to cops they could search my car because I believed smell is probable cause (it isn’t) so now I’m dealing with that (court tomorrow.) I feel like a fucking loser and don’t have a single clue how I’ll get to do the things in life I want even when I sit myself down and think about ways to get there.

Fuck marketing, social media, nonsense articles and dumb stuff on Instagram. 
I’ve realized that our brains are very limited and don’t really have that much storage. So the best option is use it for right information hosting.

And then puff, I put money on my mobile and bam, I was back to the old cycle of buzzy annoying infos and worried mind.

47,"Hey guys, I’m new to Reddit and just found this thread. I’ve been thinking a lot about this and have wanted to randomly vent on the internet to strangers about it and this seems like a good place to do it.

I’ve always been shy and lean more toward the introverted side. I also think I may have mild social anxiety, but it really depends on the situation. Parties are not fun for me if I know few or no people, and I feel awkward a lot when I make small talk. But I’ve always felt awkward in the workplace. I’ve had quite a few jobs throughout college and now I am a recent graduate and have had my first full time jobs. I currently work in a medical billing office, and I don’t enjoy it. I graduated with a degree in marine biology and love the ocean, but where I currently live is nowhere near the ocean or anything related to it (no aquariums). So I’m at this current job just to make money. My husband is in his last semester of his undergrad so hopefully when he graduates we will be able to move somewhere by the ocean 😎. So that’s just the backstory here: I’m at a cubicle job that I find brain-numbing and am a quiet, introverted gal. 

At my workplace I work in an office with about 8 other medical billers. They’re all very nice and helpful, but have all known each other for months or years and all seem like good friends. I am new and don’t know anyone and spend the majority of my days sitting quietly at my desk working, which I have no problems with. I actually enjoy working independently and being able to get lost in my own thoughts. People at my work ALWAYS (like at least once everyday) mention to me or about me that I am “so quiet”. One woman I sit across said to me “radical_spatula, the fact that you’re so quiet is starting to bother me! You need to talk more!!!” I found this annoying because I am naturally quiet and don’t really want to speak all the time like my coworkers usually do. Many people I work with are loud and love to talk, which is fine. But it’s just not me. I’m tired of being told I “need to talk more”. Also, whenever I do speak (i do talk occasionally- I’m not a psychopath), that same woman will mock surprise and will say something like “woah there, I’m not used to hearing you speak! You’ll have to ease us into it haha!”

Does anyone else have this? I just find it annoying that it seems to bother my coworkers that I am introverted and enjoy working in peace. ",19Dec2017,3
48,"Since watching YouTube Rewind, I realized I don't really know that much about, well, anything there. I tried ""branching out"" to try to catch all references, but quickly I've realized that I don't care about most of that stuff.

However, I still wish I could get **all** the references there. More so, I wish I could be a part of every movement in YouTube. And, all that made me realize I'd like to be a part of everything, everywhere on the world.

Obviously, that's impossible. Choice is inevitable.",19Dec2017,1

50,"I never go into the friendship thinking more then friends but my dumb brain always decides at some point , hey she actually cute tho and her personality is a perfect fit for your own you should totally fall helplessly for her and then probably somewhere down the road hit the platonic wall and end up hurt and then have to isolate yourself from her to overcome these shitty feels.

Like it's ridiculous. I don't want this. I want friendship that I can count on always. Not this shit always. ",19Dec2017,8
