1,"This is a question that gets posted on in various forms on Reddit almost every day. Often this question is tied to global climate change or some other looming ecological disaster.

A few examples below, don’t worry I only listed 4:

As a older Reddit user, turning 54 this next month,  I thought I might explain to some of you, especially the younger ones why we, and yes I'm including myself in that group, often ignore the facts that experts go to such lengths to inform us with. The reason is simple. The ""experts"" have a very long track record of being wrong, and not just a little long, but wildly wrong.  Experts have, since the beginning of written history, been prophesying doom of one sort or another.  

A thousand years ago it was the religious experts that were absolutely sure that the world would end with the year 1000. In fact here is a [list of dates predicted for the end of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dates_predicted_for_apocalyptic_events) on Wikipedia. If you look at that list closely you will notice something peculiar. Before the 1900 all the predictions were based in religion. But starting with the Camille Flammarion prediction that the 1910 appearance of Halley's Comet would snuff out all life on the planet, the predictions took a decidedly scientific turn.  Of course there was still a lot of religious predictions and the Wikipedia article focuses on those, but outside religion the predictions of a natural disaster or calamity destroying all life on earth seemed to be on everyone's mind. [Here]( http://1499.com/) is a list of some of the scientific predictions for the last 100 years. All of these were wrong, and many are spectacular failures. 

Look at this example:  **It is now pretty clearly agreed that the CO2 content in the atmosphere will rise 25% by 2000. This could increase the average temperature near the earth's surface by 7 degrees Fahrenheit. This in turn could raise the level of the sea by 10 feet. Goodbye New York. Goodbye Washington, for that matter. - Presidential advisor Daniel Moynihan 1969** or how about this gem **In ten years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct. Large areas of coastline will have to be evacuated because of the stench of dead fish. - Paul Ehrlich, Earth Day 1970** or this wildly wrong  prediction **An international team of specialists has concluded from eight indexes of climate that there is no end in sight to the cooling trend of the last 30 years, at least in the Northern Hemisphere. - New York Times - January 5, 1978**

People like me, the older generation, grew up in the 1950s 60s 70s with these dire predictions all around us. And this does not even include the always looming threat of nuclear war. Almost everyone in those days believed that nuclear war with the Soviet Union was inevitable. We grew up with that sword of Damocles hanging over our head. As we grew older we watched as EVERY one of the most dire weather predictions failed to materialize. And now we have the experts telling us that a [two degree rise will change the world](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/11/2-degrees-will-change-world-paris-climate-change). BULLSHIT is how we respond!

For a hundred years the experts have been saying we're all going to die, but we are still here.
The climate changes. The earth has been much warmer than it is now, and it has been much cooler too. Life, mankind, finds a way. Sure there will be changes in the future but this is nothing new, life goes on. 

There are two things that everyone of these dire predictions fail to address. The positive side of global warming and the ingenuity of mankind. The positive side of global warming you may ask?   How about fewer winter deaths; lower energy costs; better agricultural yields; fewer droughts; richer biodiversity. It is a little-known fact that cold weather deaths exceed hot summer deaths, not just in first world countries, but also those with very warm summers. Don’t believe me, how about [Professor Richard Tol of Sussex University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Tol)? There are many more, take time to research both sides of the debate.
 
And then there is the ingenuity of mankind. I am completely confident in the ability of mankind to make the technological and engineering advancements to mitigate the negative effects of global warming.

7,"Some sites only use Flash for video playback. You could write scripts that replace those with HTML5 video, unless the videos are, say, FLVs. But being able to write a ""universal"" covnerter may be unlikely, as there are different kinds of video playback systems.

But more often than not, Flash is used for vector animations. Usually with sound. Something like that will be really hard to replicate unless you know how the file is formatted.

Even today, Newgrounds and Kongregate seem to be pretty popular.

Then there's archives or abandoned sites. Legacy content. Especially in the former case, you can't just ask the webmaster to replace their Flash setup with something else.

All in all, as insecure and resource-consuming as Flash is, someone will still need that plugin for something. The only way to get rid of Flash completely would be to have never invented it in the first place (or have had native video playback sooner)",08Feb2017,3

I am 14. Dad lives in another state. Has bipolar meltdown. He is high on pills. Everyone though I knew he was like this. I had no clue.

I am 18, a new adult. Still in high school. I work for a church minister in the afternoons. I drive my car to a porn theater. Pay the ten dollars and go inside. Sit in the theater. Notice another man watching the movie. The volume is up. Ask him, ""What is your name?"" He replies, ""Henry"". I ask Henry if he wants a handjob. He comes over and sits beside me. As I am leaving the theater I can hear him washing his hands in the theater bathroom. I get in my car and drive back to my mom's house.

I am 23. I reconnect with an old friend. He will die soon, but I don't know that yet. We will call him M. He is a minister. He was like my father. My real father is a drunk and pill head. M accepts and loves me. He knows that I am a hard drug addict but asks no questions. He encourages me to participate in his church. I come to his services high on meth. He knows but never mentions it. M dies - car wreck - head on collision; he was in his mid 30's. At his viewing his wife says 'M really loved you'.

I am 25. Rehabilitation Center. West Coast.
I am grouped with 28 other men. We sleep four to a room. Nearby a wildfire burns in the mountains. Ash rains on us. The swimming pool is filled with soot and no one can swim. I tell my counselor that I am not an 'art fag'. He looks offended as he is gay. I tell him that I have been with men, but the drugs confuse everything. He discharges me from the hospital with a 'high future risk for relapse'.

Two weeks later. High again. I sold the amp that M gave me. The first place I went after rehab was my drug dealers house.

15,"This is quite embarrassing for me but I'm turning to Reddit for the first time because I want to have outside perspective. Please inform me if there are more details needed that would factor into my decision. I can be quite oblivious at times and might seem harsh but I'm going to explain it as best as I can.



I (26M) met Janet (24F) through a friend and became acquaintances for two years then turned into mutual friends with benefits for almost a year. I wanted it to remain that way because sometimes I didn't see myself dating her. A few months into being friends with benefits she starting being more intimate hinting at a relationship. I stated I did not want one and she was hurt but we remained friends. This is where I messed up because shortly after we continued our friends with benefit relationship. I can be quite oblivious at times and in hindsight, I thought she was okay with it but she interpreted it as a chance for me to change my mind.





I've gotten close to her and she's honestly a genuine person. She carries characteristics which I would find in a potential wife such as being selfless towards not just me but others as well. I honestly don't even know what a marriage would be like as I've only have experiences with 3 other past girlfriends.





I realized I've hurt her plenty in not reciprocating and it does hurt me to see her hurting so I drew the line a few days ago. Her being devastated would be an understatement.






The reason I wasn't completely onboard into a relationship was because of certain features of her face. She's not ugly at all and I do feel extremely shallow but I can't help but feel the way I do. I know it's something she can't change and I want to be head over heels about her facial features.







Lately, I've been having second thoughts if I'd regret in the future for not knowing how good I have it. The grass will always be greener on the other side of the fence? I think I'm still relatively young and I'm being extremely picky but I feel I still have time to date more people in hopes of someone who's just as caring but cuter? 






In a sense, I'm gambling to not settle for less for lack of better wording. I know I'm messed up for not being the better person before. I'd love Reddit to screw my head back on correctly.

45,"It really hit me today. I was in class in college and we're in groups for some project we have to complete over the semester. I got thrown into a group late cause I missed the first class. I was thrown into a group of girls who all know each other and seem to be friends. I kinda felt like I was intruding, but as a guy in a group of pretty attractive girls, I wasn't really complaining all that much. I've only known them for a couple of weeks, and we only have to meet once a week for our assignment, but they seem pretty friendly all round. Anyway, today we'd met up for class and things were the usual. Two of the girls who seem to be like best friends were talking non-stop to each other which left me and about 3 other girls kinda sitting there not truly involved in the conversation. I noticed one of the girls who I'd talked to a little before kept trying to start a conversation with me and joke around, while the others just looked at their phones, so I ended up up talking a bit with her about the assignment and how it was a pain in the ass.

Eventually we had to move onto computers, and I ended up sharing one with the girl I'd been talking to. At first things had that that feeling of polite tension you get with the someone new where you're trying to just be super nice. After we both failed to login to the computer for some reason we started joking around and a little bit of teasing started happening. After just like a few minutes of talking and realising we were kinda on the same wavelength humour wise things seemed really relaxed, and there was no awkwardness. We ended up getting on the computer eventually and making a joke PowerPoint about how pointless the assignment was. As class went on we were laughing at each other's jokes more and more and we ended up just talking about each other's lives and shit for like the full hour. There was definitely a little bit of playful flirting going on. Nothing massive, just that kind of faux-teasing thing people tend to do to each other when they're flirting really lightly. Her friends were at the computer next to us but we didn't even talk to them, we were too busy in our own conversation.

Anyway, what you need to know about me is that if I click with a girl, I inevitably start falling for them really quickly. My friends have made jokes about how I fall in love with any girl who gives me the slightest bit of attention. It would be funny if it weren't so accurate. It's pretty annoying to deal with. I really feel like her and I clicked with each other almost instantly after we got talking, it was so weird. I definitely felt interested in her, so after class I looked her up on Facebook. And then I saw it.

She has a boyfriend. I feel like this always happens to me man. I click with a girl and for some reason things never work out at all. The girl has a boyfriend. I wait too long to make a move. She isn't interested in me that way. She's just naturally flirty. She loses interest. Like every single girl I've ever liked something makes it not work out. The most I've ever got off a girl is a hug. Just once man I wish it would work. I'm not saying I even liked this girl in question, too early to tell, but it's as if the universe was laughing in my face for even thinking about it. It's so annoying.

Also, I am already making plans to work in a completely different field after I graduate, so it would seem that all of this was a waste anyway.  I find myself half-assing everything now, skipping classes, totally going through the motions and wasting my time.

Today I hit a wall. I have a big project due tomorrow and I've stared at the computer screen all day and have gotten nothing done. I nearly stressed myself out to the point of a panic attack and then suddenly I wondered - what if I just fucking quit??  It's not like I need a degree to work in my field anyway.  Why don't I just fucking quit?

This has been jumping around in my mind for the last few hours and the thought just quitting makes me feel so relieved, like I'm alive again.  I have 3 heavy duty months of this left but I'm already running on fumes and wake up every day dreading it and have no plans to continue this line of work a second after I graduate.

I'm not sure why I'm writing this, but I don't have anyone to talk to about this and just need a sounding board so I'm not operating in a vacuum here. I've tried to get an appointment at student health services and the wait list is so long that I gave up.",08Feb2017,5

In my non-expert opinion Trump has a [Cluster B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_B_personality_disorders) personality disorder, or at least exhibits the symptoms. It's a grouping of four personality disorders that often occur together in people: antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic. Cluster B runs in my family. I'm well acquainted with it. 

I tried honesty. I tried fighting back. I tried outthinking it. I tried fighting fire with fire. None of that works.

Here's what you do...

**1. Judge them by their actions.** 

Words are cheap, deeds aren't. Never assume just because they said something it means anything real. Never take their word for it, but don't bother to investigate every lead either. In fact try not to listen to the words at all. They are almost always pursuing an ulterior motive and use words to keep you on the defensive, responding to one inane statement or claim after the next, rather than focusing on your own thoughts and feelings. Which leads me to #2...

**2. Focus on yourself.**

Cluster B's need constant and meaningful attention, and if they can't get positive attention they will gladly accept negative instead. They need people focusing on them and will say or do just about anything to make that happen. They use people to satisfy their needs and the relationships are almost always one-sided. They will flatter when necessary and threaten when they think that will help. 

Don't get sucked in. As much as possible, keep your distance and instead focus on yourself and positive healthy pursuits. The best thing Trump's opponents can do now is start getting ready for the 2018 midterms and the 2020 general election. Be the loyal opposition, try to keep him honest, but the main goal should be focusing on your own principles and goals.

**3. Don't try to predict them.**

Cluster B's are impulsive and volatile. They could be happy as a clam one minute, and raging like a nuclear inferno the next. And because they are so cunning, they sometimes pretend to be moving on a whim or impulse when really they have some larger scheme going on in the background, or they do it to accept some decision without losing face.

You will expend all your brainpower trying to figure out their next move and rarely be right. Don't even bother. Stay flexible, adaptive, and expect to be surprised. When you expect someone to double cross you it doesn't sting as much. You keep a clearer head and make more prudent moves.

Because they are impulsive and usually living in the moment, dealing with various skirmishes and juggling several lies, Cluster B's can sometimes (but not always) lose sight of the long game. Some are really devious masterminds who do plan for the future and maintain their power for decades, but a lot are just hopping semi-randomly from one absurd episode to the next.

**4. Don't fight back.**

[“Never wrestle with pigs. You both get dirty and the pig likes it.”](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/43033-never-wrestle-with-pigs-you-both-get-dirty-and-the) Cluster B's love to fight. [Cluster is A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder#Cluster_A_.28odd_or_eccentric_disorders.29) is considered the ""eccentric"" group. [Cluster C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder#Cluster_C_.28anxious_or_fearful_disorders.29)s are the ""anxious."" Cluster B is the ""dramatic"" group, they are attracted to hysterics and grandiosity. And what is more dramatic than a big, showy fracas? 

It also gives them the opportunity to play the victim. Cluster B's are shameless. They will do something to you secretly and then publically claim you did the exact thing to them before you have a chance to say anything. If you defend yourself it just sounds like a petty 'he said, she said' situation to outsiders. Don't bite. Don't even give them the satisfaction of a response.

I've been hearing this 'is it ok to punch a Nazi' debate recently, and I promise you, it won't end well for the punchers. If the Nazis aren't Cluster B themselves (and a number probably are) they are what's colloquially known as [Flying Monkeys](https://goo.gl/OrQRFK), the enablers and agents of a narcassitic abuser.

Sometimes they are good people who have been duped or groomed, like the members of a cult who the cult leader dotes on, or children raised in dysfunctional families. Either way they have usually grown accustomed to substituting the leader's judgement for their own. When faced with conflicting information by a stranger a Cluster B will go on the offensive, but for their subordinates they merely need to ask: ""Who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?""

Cluster B's also have symptoms of borderline (black and white) thinking. Their enemies are totally and completely wrong and they are unequivocally right. Cluster B also contains antisocial personality disorder, which basically means they can hurt other people and not feel bad about it.

Now combine those two things and you have someone who will feel completely justified in hurting other people. Cluster B's have very fragile egos, they are constantly fighting the cognitive dissonance that results from trying to maintain an impossibly perfect self image in a reality that doesn't match up.

It's like something is constantly bothering them that they either aren't fully cognizant of or are actively trying to suppress awareness of, and if you say or do something that makes that pain worse they will rush to assume that you were the cause of it all along.

Sometimes they will vanquish their enemies. Win whatever conflict they created in some way that satisfies them. But, the afterglow never lasts. The pain returns and soon enough the cycle repeats.

Because every slight hurts them deeply, they will return the pain with interest on whoever they think caused it (or whoever is nearby sometimes). If you throw a pebble at them, they will drop a cinder block on you, and they will be willing to escalate any conflict further than anyone else. They will draw a line in the sand over anything. They don't pick battles, every battle is of life and death importance.

Don't fight back. Disengage, distance, cut off if necessary, but stay civil and try to keep your composure at all times. 

Lawyers tell their clients to never volunteer information during a cross examination. Answer the question asked as succinctly as possible and then stop talking. It's good advice here too. Don't lie, don't sink to their level, don't scheme, but don't give them anything to work with either.

Michele Obama had it right: [""When they go low, we go high.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu_hCThhzWU) It might not have won the election, but it's the only thing that works against Cluster B in my experience. The only way to subdue a psychic vampire is to starve it.",08Feb2017,0
71,"Ok so i am a black girl (18) getting ready to go into college and ever since middle school i've become very shy and quiet. I only have two good friends that i've known since elementary school and since then i haven't made any more genuine connections, the most i've done is lose friends since then. Truthfully i think that the reason i'm so shy is because all the negative stereotypes put on black women. I'd like to think that i am a pretty fun, easygoing person and i desperately want people to see that side of me but i'm holding myself back because i feel like if i even do one little thing people will automatically assume i'm ""one of those black girls"" that's really loud and opinionated, or ""rachet"". i have a problem with caring too much about what people think so I desperately DON'T want people to think i'm like this. In order to convince people i'm not like my stereotype i feel like I have to be the complete opposite, quiet, shy, unoffending but it kills me that i do this because then i don't make friends. I know for the most part i'm all in my head and i just need to get over it but i cant seem to shake it. I'm really hoping that in college i'll be able to act like my true self without holding myself back. Do you guys have any advice for me? will it get better?",08Feb2017,2

Imagine if we bred, say... ***domestic cats*** on intelligence! 

How far could we push it? 

Could cats at some point start to speak? 

Imagine your pet could actually tell you what they feel like, if perhaps only on the level of a small child? It would be a **revolution!**
