1,"I'm an operations manager for a major bank amd I get tasked with a lot of extenuating circustances that require breaking policy. Some of those tasks involve small businesses and nonprofits. Today a nonprofit animal hospital was sent to my desk to help. 

Despite my best efforts and staying well past close, the employees are not going to get paid today. 

I'm just sick to my stomach. I don't know what else to say. There's nothing poetic or profound about this. I failed 20 people getting them paid and it sucks. 

To be clear, they recieved a large donation at the last minute to help pay. The guy who donated the money even got involved, but there's a lot of red tape between banks and despite my best efforts I couldn't make it work.

6,"I loved my dog. He was as perfect of a friend as I could've asked for. He was a great companion always sticking by my side. My family adopted him from when he was half a year old from a local shelter. My friends and I played with him in the yard when we were smaller. He couldn't catch a ball for his life, but he was more enthusiastic than I could ever be, endlessly sprinting from the fence to the wall and back. He was my house alarm, my vacuum cleaner, and among my friend. I read him my homework when it bored me to tears, and he listened without question. More recently, however, he had been aging. At 13, he had been alive far longer than he should have. He was nearly blind and deaf, snapping at anyone who touched him, myself included. When he was taken in, he snapped at his handlers. It was the first time in his life he had to wear a muzzle.

I've gotten rid of his bed, food and water bowls, and anything else around the house that was his. I cried, more than I did when my grandpa died. I hate to say it, but rather than the profound sadness most people find in death, I found relief from his. He hasn't been himself for the past few months and it hurt me to watch him.

10,"Just a regular dude, trying to meet some people online who know a bit about getting in shape and dropping some pounds.  I've tried finding people here, but my friends that are into it don't seem to be willing to share their time.  It's extremely hard for me to get motivated, but I know that I have to start shedding weight.  Even my girl has said something about my weight.  When I asked her if she would like to start going to the gym with me, she was all about it.  But she's always too busy or has other things going on.  I don't know the first thing about counting carbs, or how to change my diet.  

I know this sounds like I'm just lazy, but I've never had to worry about my weight before I lost my job, now that I'm by myself and nobody around me is interested in exercising with me, how do I get into this?  Its pretty hard to just dive in by yourself it seems.

I live in Calgary so if there's anyone local, or even anyone anywhere with some advice, that'd be sweet.  This shits hard and hard to build a lifestyle around it.

And if I'm just lazy, you can call me out on it.  Maybe that will help.",07Jan2017,3
12,"It's a weird song although means a lot to me.

Starts out with a high pitch man singing just random noises like eeeeeeeeee owwwwww da da da daaaaa. Then it gets faster and faster until there is a mega, crazy bass drop for a while. Then I think it goes back to the man and then base again.

It's probably quite an old song, it's very odd kinda funny.

For some reason I think the word Gorilla has got something to do with it (Might be in the name or album/artist)

13,"Dear Beautiful Stranger

The night started off innocent enough.  We were all on a work trip and we were hanging out and we met through some mutual friends.   We were just alike and hit it off immediately.   You told me all about your son and showed me some pictures.  I told you all about my wife and three kids and showed you some pictures.   We were both extremely proud of our families.  We enjoyed just talking about life in general.  

I wasn't looking for anything and neither were you.  My wedding band never comes off and you did nothing to indicate to me that you were interested in anything but hanging out.  Then the drinks started pouring....and pouring.  And the shots were coming from everywhere.  And everyone got drunk....and drunker.   And everyone danced and had a great time.  Before we knew it, we shut the place down. 

As a night came to a close, I volunteered to walk you back to your room.  Again, I had no intentions of anything whatsoever.   I do things like this often with friends and such as I just like to make sure people get to where they are supposed to get safely.   As we walked back, we continued to make small talk, though at this point it was drunken small talk.  Then you realized we were lost.  As you turned to to try to figure out where to go next, our eyes locked and I leaned in for a kiss.  I could tell by the look in your eyes it was something you wanted, but you promptly turned away and we continued looking for your hotel.  

Once we found it, we met a homeless man down stairs asking for help.  We sat down with him and talked to him for about an hour, with you gently being stern with him about some of his ways but also wanting to help.   

Then the night ended and I walked you to your room.   I told you goodnight at the door and we both smiled and turned and walked away.  

I just want to thank you.  Thank you for not allowing me to do something that would jeopardize my marriage and my family.  In another time and another place, we could have maybe been something, but you were strong enough realize that neither of us are in that time and place in this lifetime.  

Thank you for allowing me to remain faithful to my wife.  She deserves that.  My father always has told me, ""Son, you are a man and we have desires whether we want them or not.  If you want to remain faithful to your wife, then never put yourself in a situation to be unfaithful.""   I didn't listen to him, and for some reason, you made a decision that let me get out of a bad situation.  Now I know my dad's words ring true, and I will never again allow myself to get in that situation.   Your decision enabled me to learn a lesson I needed to learn, but yet not do anything that I would have forever regretted.  

Lastly, thank you for being a better person than me in that moment.   Because you were a better person that night, I am now a better person, husband, and father, and this is something I will forever be grateful for. 

So thank you.

An Average Guy w/ a Second Chance",07Jan2017,2

Dear Past-Erin,

 If there is some crazy way that the cosmos delivers this to you, I need you to get up and do me a favor.

I need you to go meet a guy. I know, I know, you're happily single and you don't need the distraction and all that. But trust me, it's worth it. 

If my memory is still working right, you should just be arriving in Kansas City right now. I know there is a lot on your mind and you have a lot to take care of, but please, go find him! You'll know him when you see him. He has dark hair and eyes, and a wonderful smile! Just look for the sexiest man you've ever seen, that's the guy. He lives just a few blocks away from you right at this very moment! 

You'll think he is kinda goofy and maybe a little ditzy. He is good at hiding how smart he is, but you'll figure that out, just like I did.

I know it seems silly, but I need you to find him, profess your undying love, and launch into a crazy relationship right this very second!

If you don't, then you two won't meet until November. That's almost a year from now! And, trust me, this is not the time for patience. Because you guys are already on borrowed time. 

Sooner or later, you are going to meet this cute neighbor guy anyway. You'll decide on a whim to accept when he asks you out. You'll think you blew it, because you were so shy that you didn't say anything, but don't worry, because he is going to call you back anyway. You will fall madly in love. He will meet our crazy family. 

In time, you will move in together. It's just a formality at that point, because you're crashing at his place every night anyway. You'll love every day that you wake up next to this person.

So get up, and go find him right now. And when you find him, cherish every second. Don't blink. Soak in every word he says. Don't waste a single moment. Don't waste time with stupid arguments. And tell him every single thing you think of him, make absolutely certain he knows what he means to you every single day.

Because one day he is going to have to leave for California for just a couple months. And the last time you will ever see him alive is when you drop him off at the airport.

Stop reading, now. Go. Find. Him. Because two years will never, ever be enough. Tell him that, even though he doesn't know you yet, you need him to come out and meet you, ten months early. Because a time will come when you would give everything you own and every ounce of blood in your body to have those ten months.

So, please, just do this favor for me.

Love always,
Future-Erin",07Jan2017,5
16,"But on the major kink I have is creampies. In porn and in my own personal sex life. I feel very vanilla since it's mostly a biological desire (I think anyway). I'm wondering if think kink is caused by the taboo nature of it for me personally -- cumming inside much means an increased likelihood for children, which I don't desire. 

I saw on PornHub's year-in-review that searches for ""creampie"" porn has increased since the year before, and I personally believe that more of my generation (I'm currently 24) will choose to not have children than those of years past. Perhaps this search will continue to increase.

I'm so frustrated with the lack of adequate medical care that I feel it's not even worth trying to get help any more. Last spring I started gaining weight, inexplicably, and also started lactating at 48 years old. The fatigue hit. Then the pain started. My thumbs hurt, then my wrists and elbows started burning. Now it's in my shoulders and hips. Then my ankles. Now my neck. It's practically impossible for me to walk downstairs without watching and judging every step for fear of falling. It took me four tries yesterday to open the shampoo bottle. If my foot itches I have to do a cost/benefit analysis to decide whether the pain of reaching down to scratch is worth the relief from itching. . I don't want to live this way. My ana test shows I have an autoimmune disorder. The wait for a rheumatologist is six months in my county. Meanwhile I get sicker and weaker and less capable every single day.

24,"A few hours ago I was settling into my evening just fine. Sitting on my bed with How I Met Your Mother playing in front of me. I was comfortable. I had just gotten a comfy mattress for my new apartment and the tiny space heater in the corner was making it snug and cozy in the comforts of my Washington home. My new home. My old home was Illinois, where I was born and raised but hadn't lived in some time. Still, I missed it and all the people I left there.

I was halfway into my beer when I got the call from my sister. The call about my grandmother in the hospital. It didn't surprise me. At 90 years old and trips to the hospital seemingly every month, I figured it would be just another trip, nothing too serious. She'd be out in a few days. This time was different though. Not because of the doctors warning my sister to plan for the worst as that was normal. Not due to her condition as she had been through worse. It was different because of my grandma's attitude. A woman whose childhood was during the great depression, who had lost loved ones to war, her sister to depression, her husband to a heart attack at a young age, her kidney to cancer, and her strength to countless other ailments over the past two decades. She's always been a fighter, but according to my sister she was ready to put up her gloves. She was ready to stop fighting. Her attitude had changed from aggressively defiant, to peacefully accepting.

I got online and bought the next ticket I could. 5am out of Seattle, 6-7 hours back to Illinois. I threw together my belongings and got some stuff packed for the days ahead. And after I tossed in socks, a toothbrush, and a few books; I looked in my closet and saw my suit. My grandma is in the hospital alive as I type this in the terminal, waiting for my flight in two and half hours. But a lot can change in a few days. A lot can change in a few seconds. I didn't want to pack my suit. I generally don't like wearing them. Often once a wedding or fancy even is finished I loosed the tie and and untuck my shirt, maybe slip out to my car and swap for some jeans. I don't like the restricting range of the jacket, and the perceived look of sophistication that is implied when people wear it. But I knew I might need the suit on this trip. I knew I might have to suffer through it and slip my arms through the sleeves. I knew I might have to shake hands and keep tissues in the pockets for my siblings. I knew I might had to fiddle with buttons nervously as I wait for people to come, to go, and to say sorry to my family and me. I knew all this was close to reality. So I packed the suit.

I hope I make it time. I hope there is more time when I finally get there. Time left to laugh as we always like to. Time to talk about her youth and adventures in Chicago. Time to reminisce about when the days were younger and summers seemed longer. Time to go for a drive through the country and get ice cream. She's not the doting old lady who pushed mints into your pocket with a smile. She's the kind of woman who likes to rev her engine next to college students and gleam at the look of confusion in their eyes. She's a rebel. She's an outlier. She's a really kooky old broad.

If I don't make it I know I'll regret not making more time to see her when I was back in town. Not visiting more than I could have. Not taking the time just to check up on her. That's life though, you only start realizing these things when you're losing them. I still have a lot of great people in my life, people I often overlook or put on standby. People I think of but can't muster the energy to drag my fingers across my phone to create a message to send them. Good people, sad people, driven people, lost people...people very dear to me.

These gestures don't have to be huge. Sometimes they're a visit and other times there's just a text checking in. But let me give you some advice, don't want until a solemn phone call to do something nice. Don't wait til someone is in the hospital to tell them how much they mean to you. Don't wait til it's just convenient for you to check in on a friend who for all you know could use one this very second. Don't wait until someone is almost gone for you to tell them how you feel. Because suits are a tragic thing to plan on wearing sometimes. If there's someone you want to talk to, who might need some help, or someone you just sort of miss....call them. Call them today. Call them 10 seconds from now. Call them right now if you can. Because your suit might be in the closet just waiting for you to put it on and greet them, but you may not like the circumstances of your visit

I don't want to hurt anybody, but maybe I'm just pathetic and even my good friends then might have recognized that quick.

My grandparents are all very active people, and all 4 are still kickin it. They walk around, cook, my grandpa on dads side actually surpases me in energy (I'm 23m) as he wakes up at the crack of dawn and goes for a morning swim in the ocean. Anyways, I've never experienced death in my family, with the exception of my great grandma but I wasn't close enough to her to feel loss from it. I haven't lost friends either, luckily.
