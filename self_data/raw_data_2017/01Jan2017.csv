2,So I don't really know how reddit works but I'm pretty desperate at the moment. The last time I went out to bars with my friends I got unexpectedly way to drunk and made a fool of myself. I went up to two random girls who I've never seen before in my life and put my arms around them to dance with them. 100% looked like a lesbian and 100% cringeworthy. Since then I keep thinking about it over and over and it's actually making me depressed because I can't forgive myself. I haven't been eating or talking and I just feel so shitty. If anyone has any quality advice on self forgiveness I'd love to hear it ,01Jan2017,10

6,"I love him more than anything. He's the treasure of my life this past 4 years. And he broke up with me because he's questioning everything in his life right now and needs to be alone for a while to figure stuff out. He assured me repeatedly it wasn't my fault, but I keep thinking of all the things I could have done better.

Last New Year's we went to his parents' house and watched silly New Year's TV specials, then went home together and cuddled till we fell asleep. This New Year's I'm sitting here alone in an apartment half empty of furniture and entirely empty of love and companionship. He's probably either at the new apartment he moved into today or meeting his co-workers somewhere.

I'm dreading going to sleep tonight. I know I'll wake up alone. In the 4 years we dated, we never spent more than a week and a half apart at a time. I don't know how I'm going to get through the upcoming...everything without him there to love and be loved by. He's the only man I've ever loved. I hoped we would marry one day.

7,"I hate holidays.  I'm serious.  I mean I like having the day off for holidays, but I hate the actual holidays themselves.  Not just the December ones.  All of them.  Sometimes I hate that I'm the humbug, but, man, I just can't ever get into the spirit that everyone else seems to have.

I honestly can't remember a holiday or birthday that I've wanted to participate in.

I didn't want to interact with the neighbors.  I don't want to chit chat with family.  I just want to sit back and watch tv or play games.

All holidays are to me is a way for my wife to drain my bank account.  She'll buy me presents, but honestly, I don't want any.  Really!  I don't want anything.  I mean sure I'd love the winning lottery ticket, who wouldn't, but I mean I have no desire to receive gifts from people.  In all honesty, I kind of hate getting gifts, because now I feel beholden to people to say thank you for something I didn't want in the first place.

Man, just reading this makes me feel like an asshole.  I swear I'm not depressed or anything.  I'm not suicidal, or unhappy, or anything.  Well, no more unhappy than the next person I guess.  I just don't feel any joy from any of this.  Occasionally I get a little joy from getting my kids something they like, but I derive none of that same pleasure from receiving anything.

Maybe it's not the holidays I hate.  Maybe it's the gifts.

Happy New Year people.  Hope it all goes well for you.",01Jan2017,3

20,"There's a lot to it, but over the past few months I've been experiencing another really bad bout of depression (omg more depression posts in r/self why). It's been really bad over the holidays especially between not being with my family for Christmas or New Year's for the first time. I posted something about it to some of my social media pages, and I suddenly had a burst of a handful of people reaching out to me asking if I was okay and saying that they were there for whatever they could do to help.

It was interesting to see that because there wasn't really anyone talking to me before this. It makes sense, the holidays are crazy and a lot of people are busy being with family or friends or just not wanting to talk to anyone because they might be in a similar situation. But I digress.

After seeing these handful of people reach out, and a few lengthy conversations with some friends and family, I've started to feel a little bit better about humanity. The situation I'm in is still shitty overall in terms of my job, the environment with it, and the people there. But(!) I've come to a realization:

The change that I want to see in the world starts with how I see myself before I see myself in others' eyes. So maybe this is the start of something new for me. I sure hope so.

I think I'll start getting my poetry out in the world; not sure where to put that though where it'll get some exposure. Maybe even some of my music if I can do that. Maybe I'll pick up another hobby. Only time will tell I suppose.

Thank you, Reddit, for another year of entertainment and information that's done a lot of good for me. I hope everyone here (and everywhere else!) has a good new year, and let's hope it'll be better than this past one.

Cheers.",01Jan2017,41

26,"So I used to be one half of a pair of students welcoming freshmen into college. We set up this thing to be like a student information resource for them so they wouldn't be confused, and I used to set up random chat sessions and google hangouts so they could make new friends.

This wasn't too great an idea on my side, because of my staggering social ineptitude (that I'm sometimes not even able to hide online) so I wasn't too great at participating a lot myself, because my conversation sounded like ""hey guys im randommm"" or ""wanna do something this evening lol"" even if I desperately tried to avoid that. The attention quickly shifted to the other guy, and although I was feeling more lucky than bitter, I'd get a sudden surge in courage and reach out to a new student. 

I did that once with this one freshman. I saw her name, and I remember two friends who were from Nepal who had a similar surname. Ha! I found a great conversation starter. So as if I'm pulling a Troy McClure, I messaged her ""Hey! I'm Karold_Harradine from the facebook group. I'm one of the guys answering all those questions.""

*""hi!""*

""If you've got any questions, don't feel shy to message me with them!""

27,"Hello, friends!

My surname is **Li** (although pronounced *lee*), hers is **Hayworth**.

Should we make it as **Li-Hayworth** or **Lee-Hayworth**?

I feel the latter looks better in terms of writing and gives less confusion to people as sometimes they pronounce my surname as ""lie"". Only problem is I may feel my parents might not be happy with the minor change in spelling although it is pronounced the same. I am of asian descent and when written in chinese, the character is still the same both in chinese lettering and pronunciation.

Both of us agree that my surname sounds better in front, now we're just debating on the spelling of it.

What do you guys think?

29,"Been on reddit since 2012. Back then, it had a much different feel to it than it does now. It wasn't a complete cesspool like 4chan was, but it had a 4chan feel to it yet it also encouraged discussions on intellectual topics, while still being a laid back place where you could make usernames and be completely anonymous, or become internet-known by your username. 

I don't recall exactly how much moderation there used to be, but the fact that [test post please ignore](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/92dd8/test_post_please_ignore/) could be the highest post of all time on /r/pics shows that this site used to be a little looser and more relaxed.

It also had sort of a summer camp feel to it in a weird sort of way. It reminded me of those hangouts in 12th grade where inexplicably you'd have semi-popular kids at the same party as a bunch of nerds/neckbeards but everyone would put their image aside for a while and just chill and have fun. 

But now I really think this site lost much of its original magic, and it's only going to get worse. I don't think it's becoming facebook, but it's just apparent that the site is run primarily by the mods of the subreddits.

Nowadays, each subreddit has a long list of rules, and if you try to post something, there is probably a 90% chance it gets removed. And a lot of the time it's removed by automoderator, which is especially frustrating. The site doesn't really benefit from its upvote/downvote system anymore. It's moreso about the mods and how they want the subreddit to be. 

Another problem is mods of subreddits going on powertrips. Reddit is a very understaffed website, and there are tons of users. Without mods, this site would be absolutely run to the ground. Mods should really be paid for their services due to how much work they put into making reddit function. 

So why would someone volunteer their free time to be a moderator on Reddit for free? Well, the answer is that they love the internet power they have. This is like payment for them. It's a blessing and a curse - without them, this site would seriously fall apart. However, there is a point at which the mod powertripping just gets annoying, and I've found that it's reached that threshold. And there's nothing that the admins can do to change it because, quite frankly, it works for them perfectly. They can understaff the website and have a bunch of power-tripping mods slave away at moderating the site. Admins have actually struck gold with this arrangement.

I could rant more about Reddit and how it's changed since 2012, but this is a pretty big wall of text so I think I'll just submit it in the hopes that people actually read it.

Then I look at the like and the comment count and think ""Wow, I used to get those numbers too!"" and that's what made it suck for a guy who can get easily addicted. This seemed like some sort of a game and competition, and when someone's posted a picture of them, some random joke or a ""Here's what happened in my year"" and I see upwards of 80, 100, 200 likes I think ""does that really deserve that?"" and will probably try to spit some snark because I look at this as a cutthroat contest. I didn't want to be bitter anymore, and keep comparing every damn person's status with mine and ask ""what do they have that I don't"" repeatedly until I get tired of scrutinizing myself and whatever anyone else posted. And for a while the internet could do anything for me, and it was the world to me, and I didn't need to see anything or anyone in the real world.

I was addicted to Facebook for a fairly long while and it just ended up becoming a challenge to optimize the amount of likes I had for each post, I was pretty pathetic.

I left a message with the humane society, I posted a missing dog ad on Craigslist and another on a neighborhood app. I don't have Facebook but created one just so I could post in the local groups. They're private so I can't post until I'm accepted into the group but in a specific group for my neighborhood I saw a post advocating calling the non emergency hotline if they see animals in distress in my neighborhood (it's super cold right now). The thing is my dog is an inside dog and she has a doggy door. Ay night she likes to go out and get her sniffs in. She's old and doesn't go out much on her own so I doubt she left on her own. The gate was closed when I got home. All I can think it she was out for her nightly wandering and someone walked by so she barked at them (she has a tendency to get scared, especially at night, she's even barked at me on occasion) and whoever was passing by saw this little cockapoo in this snow covered yard and thought she had been left outside and took her. I really hope that's the case and that they will bring her back. She didn't have her collar on, I only put it on her when we go on walks. I don't know what else I can do. I'm alternating between crying and coming up with all the terrible scenarios she could be in. I really hope she ended up at home with some well intentioned person and is warm.

Then I got drunk at work and ended up losing my wallet and phone. I had very beautiful pictures on my phone.

I went home and celebrated a belated new years with my friends. After they had left I looked for my cat and he was nowhere to be found. I waded through the thick fresh snow in people's backyards looking desperately for my one eyes cat wbome Id found on the sreets as a little malnourished kitten with breathing problems.  since have grown attached to this kitten and the thought of losing an innocent and cute little animal who've I've given another chance at life and failed it to a freezing death was terrible. I was overloaded of emotions and felt a terrible disconnection from my body as I was seeing another's malfortune . I then realized I could not just mope and cry about losing a cat so I forced myself to get up. It was my brain literally overpowering my emotional side and taking the logical step. This force of initiative was something I've never experienced and I would imagine it's similai on a lesser extent to what a parent must feel for a lost child.

This force of will literally took command of my body and my logical brain. despite all the alcohol and marijuana consumed during new years. managed to make my body get up and look for my lost one eyed kitten. This feeling was like no other, and after I searched in people's back yards, ocasionally breaking down into a teary mess - I found my kitten huddled up in a tree in my backyard. When Ii found hiim he ran into my apartment and that is when I just collapsed on the floor and cried tears of joy for the first time.

  When I am brushing my teeth I have to pay much atention so I am sure that I didn't miss a spot so I don't have to start over again on a thar area. This results in me brushing my teeth so long that spiting out blood has become a daily occurance. 
  Now defecation. When defecating I again pay attention. I pay attention as to where has the feces ""touched"" my butt. I do not use toilet paper. I use the shower (which I gather is similar if not the same as the bidet) to wash my butt. I again spend a lot of time washing, which results in mild itching.

Hey there, I have been making piano videos and uploading them to YouTube for years now, but recently went into doing it in a big way (a video a week). Here's an example of my content: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGjjnZdK4HA (interesting parts start at 0:18)

I try to make everything the best possible quality with what I have, like making videos that are impressive because it has the potential to go viral. The thing is, nothing I do seems to ""catch"", even my best attempt at doing something outstanding. I've seen lots of videos that blow up because of some impressive element, but it doesn't seem to work for me despite trying.

So if you have any suggestions, what do you think would make piano videos ""catch"" on YouTube? Other piano channels have hundreds of thousands of subscribers and tens of thousands of views on each video. I'd love to do that too, but mine will get a couple of thousand views if I'm lucky. I'm thinking I have to resort to gimmicky things in order to get more people to watch my videos. Because the way I'm trying to do it, just good quality content, doesn't really have that spark that gets people watching.

Any suggestions on how I can accomplish this? Particularly if you think there's something that makes a video ""catch"". Thanks!

54,"Update: Finally got a hold of someone. Waiting for them to send back a bit of money so we can pay rent. Going to see if they can take only less next time. Our ATT services are going to get shut off tomorrow. Not a big deal, but theyre going to charge us extra to get it turned back on.. which kind of sucks and will set us back. We didnt get a lot of groceries and somehow forgot to get diapers (but we found some emergency ones lol). The loan agencies are a bit mad but we are going to get them wiped away come income tax.
Husband is going to start school as soon as possible but we hit road bumps. We have to put one child in preschool and one in daycare, but their shots arent updated. We have tricare, but since we changed regions the drs office needs us to pay deductibles to get their shots. We don't have the $47 right now for tricare prime or the $67 deductible for each child. I need to call Tricare because that doesnt even make sense but whatever. Still taking it all one day at a time.


So, my husband was going to ITT Tech but all the schools closed down. He was using his GI Bill. 
He just retired so we were transitioning from Military life to civilian life. He is a disabled vet so he gets retirement and we still have insurance.
I also just got a pretty good job to help out. We were just about to finally be in the ""clear"" financially. We moved twice since he's been out. We've had to use payday loans to get by and we were about to pay them back this month and next month, but then something happened:
My husband checked the bank account and it showed $3 from his retirement. We didn't think much of it, maybe it was from the raise he gets yearly, the VA sent a notice. He checks the eBenefits page. No, they garnished it from him using his GI Bill for ITT Tech. Since he never finished, because they shut down, it turned into a loan. But we never got a notice, no payment plan, no loan forgiveness since he never saw it coming. 
Now we can't pay rent, our car, utilities, the Internet, or get groceries. We have 3 kids and we only live within our means. We didn't go crazy for Christmas, but we do have bills from just moving. We've had to get a total of 4 semi-managable loans just to make it. We don't have a savings. We used to, but we had to use it.
I'm not even sure if this was even legal. I have student loans but they haven't taken my pay to pay for them. I was even able to defer it. Why wasn't my husband given a chance.
We've tried to call the VA, but I'm guessing we weren't the only ones. They're backed up with calls and just let us know they're disconnecting us.

WE WERE ALMOST THERE! UGGGH DAMMIT. anyway going to try and stay positive. This isn't our first rodeo. Going to figure out something and talk to our landlord and utilities and see if we can get an extension. The only thing that scares me is if they're going to take everything for the next 4-6 months.

As of now, I plan to see a psychiatrist. In the mean time, I've just been idling online since it's all I can do. My mom's car was repossessed a few days ago, so I'm stuck here. I tried meditating to make myself happier, but I put too much stake in it and it made me unhappy. Now I'm just looking for an outlet - something not too intensive like chess or competitive shooters - that I can pass the time in until my problem is fixed. Do any of you have any ideas?

63,"There have been many massive conspiracies that lasted years, even decades, before being exposed. There are likely many others that haven't been exposed as well. Here's a small sample of proven conspiracies:

- [MKULTRA](http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Project_MKULTRA.html)

(We almost didn't receive proof of this. Due to an error in the process of destroying all documents, a small amount survived and provided proof of the MKULTRA program. It was a multi-decade, international conspiracy involving top universities and hospitals. In Canada, it was run by the president of the World Psychiatric Association)

What about ""chemtrails?"" That's a crazy conspiracy theory, right? Yes and no. The people who believe that all/most planes produce chemtrails are wrong, but there have been many cases where the US and UK government sprayed their own populations with chemical and biological materials as part of a covert operation.

In 2016, I lost my virginity to an incredibly attractive girl, dropped 60 pounds, did better in school than I have since elementary, made a bunch of new friends on top of getting much closer to the old ones, stopped selling drugs, and finally got a real job. When I list it out like that it doesn't seem like a whole lot of things, but for someone who has been fat, lazy, anti-social, and unemployed my whole life, this year was life changing.
