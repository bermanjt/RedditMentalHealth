2,"We usually study together on Sundays. I'm a thousand miles from home at university and I like the distance from my family and close friends, but it leaves me with very little mental support while I am at school. I've gotten closer friends here and I feel comfortable enough to finally talk to them about what's going on inside my head. It was just about timing, and I wanted to do it today, but since they canceled I feel kind of lost.

My friends are still good people, they just had other work that is a higher priority tonight. I'm just not sure if I can work up the nerve a second time to tell them about it.

I don't need any help or anything, just a little bummed. Any of you guys had this experience?",16Oct2017,2
4,"I just found out I'm pregnant and my parents are forcing me to have an abortion (Keep in mind I'm in my early 20's). The way of forcing me to have an abortion is by threatening to kill themselves if I don't because the culture I was brought up in frowns upon pregnancies before marriage. I have also brought up getting married before the baby comes &amp; that still wasn't enough.

The baby's father wants to be a family &amp; is willing to do whatever he can as we are in a relationship with each other. 

I would love some opinions on this F***** up situation as I'm at a loss of what to do. It's either I sacrifice my child for my parents or my parents for my unborn baby. I do not mind having the baby, but I really don't know how to handle the situation when my parents threaten to kill themselves.",16Oct2017,7
5,"Two days ago, I was told that an online friend of mine was in intensive care in the hospital. An hour after that, I was told they'd passed away. I've been pretty out of sorts ever since.

To be honest, I'm not sure why I'm as affected as I am. I'm hesitant to even call this person my friend because we were not particularly close. We were both in a chat room of about 15 people where people played board, video and tabletop games together on weekends, with conversation being slightly infrequent other than that (it happened, but it was also common for days to pass in silence, at least during the 4 hours or so I wasn't at work or asleep.) We'd known each other for well over five years, and last week I'd have called them a friend without a second thought, but this week that seems to be inflating the relationship we had.

Maybe it was the fact that they were younger than me. It's humbling to realize that even someone in their early thirties can go from alive to dead in a single day. I'm not entirely clear on the cause of death, but as far as I know, it wasn't an accident or anything. I could be next. Either because of an accident, because my lifestyle isn't terribly healthy, or because of the fault in my stars, to crib a phrase from Shakespeare by way of John Green.

Maybe it was the fact that I never made a particular effort to have a closer friendship with this person. I just assumed they'd always be there and if they needed help, they'd ask for it. I have no idea if having closer friends could have prevented their death somehow - from the facts I do know, it's unlikely, in fact - but now I never will.

Maybe this is a perfectly normal reaction to a sudden death, even that of someone you weren't very close to, and I just feel strange about it due to the fact that no one else is publicly grieving. Because that's just not the kind of thing you do in an online chat room, really. I'm sure they're all equally sad, especially those who were closer to that person than I was.

Has anyone dealt with a situation like this before? I thought about putting this in /r/advice instead, but I'm honestly not sure what I need or want to hear - probably not concrete advice or anything. Just... words. Post anything you want, just like this subreddit is for. Funny jokes might help.",16Oct2017,6

7,"Throwaway.

College freshman geek here.

Myself and my 3 stupid friends had this idea to ""ruin"" his 22 year old sister's big party by streaking through it.

Naked.

During her party, we all ran out of his room upstairs, with nothing on.

""WOOOOO!!!"" hands in the air.

All 3 of us like 5'7, slightly chubby, white from the neck down.

Running down the stairs and through the entire house.

We expected his sister and her friends to be so mad.

Instead they laughed so hard and pointed. 

""Look at those little weenies, they are so cute!""

""Oh my God those adorable chubby bubble butts on all 3!""

""Nice freshman 15 bellies, boys, you all skip the gym this semester?""

Then they broke out cell phone cameras.

We all panicked and went from confident to covering ourselves with our hands and ran out the backdoor in desperation when her friend's blocked the stairway back upstairs. Her older friend said ""Enjoy the fresh air, virgin boys!"" and slapped my bare butt as I was the last one out the door.

His sister of course used that opportunity to lock us out of the house. After a few minutes of banging on the glass and apologizing, begging to be let back instead, we realized we had to run to my other friend's house around the block, at 8:00 pm in 30 degree weather, buck naked.

I can't think of it at night without tossing and turning.",16Oct2017,0

Have I done something? Have they discovered that I'm really not worth that much? The lottery ticket that didn't mean squat? Maybe this was always the case, maybe my winning streak ended and I peaked. I find reasons to hate people and distance myself from them these days, I'm more afraid because I've gotten used to having no one around. And maybe I'm no longer what was advertised, and they're distancing themselves from me because there's no other ways to hedge your bets otherwise. If I fall, it's all on me.",16Oct2017,1
12,"Some background:  I relocated for work and have been in town for the past 2 months.  I initially looked for rooms to rent and when I couldn't find anything suitable, I tried a few rooms in a bed and breakfast.  It was OK when it was almost empty but loud when it was full.  I met some interesting people, a couple were quiet that I barely heard in this old house without much sound insulation.  

However there were more unreasonably loud people like the gay couple who banged their metal framed bed against wall causing knocking sounds to the guy who was warned not to put clothing with heavy zippers and buttons in the dryer and yet did it anyway after the homeowner went to bed, even after 10:30pm and even 11pm! on a week night when people had to get up for work early the next day.  

Needless to say I've been looking for a new room to rent and made some visits recently.  One place was a cold and unfurnished basement room with a grouchy renter living on the ground floor.  Another one had potential - it was a single mom with a teenage kid and 2 dogs.  But when I followed up by FB messenger which we used to set up the visit, she ghosted me (I don't have her number).   I then found a new ad today posted by the FB group's organizer who urged people to call or text.  I noticed they checked in from out of town so I thought this was fishy and texted.  She explained she was on the road on the way back.

Here's our text chat:

Me:  Hi Lisa, this is Shhhquietplease, I saw your ad on the FB group about a room to rent in your house.  Can you give me more details?

Her bf answering for her:  Hello good to know you, it's Lee we're a quiet couple , I'm in (city on the road), we'll return to Alamazoo, I'll call you at 7 or 8 pm today ok?
Also we live on Main Street.

Me (I was still typing before they replied):  The info I'm looking for is the address, if you're smokers, number of bathrooms/toilets shared with how many people, which floor the room to rent is on, etc. 

Them:  We don't smoke, we're a couple in a 3 bedroom house. We provide internet, you can do your own cooking just bring your stuff and food.   We're looking for someone calm and respectful.

Me:  Thanks for the information.  I'm a non smoker, calm , in fact a quiet place is important to me and that's the main reason I'm looking for something else.  Sure we can talk later, by the way I'm from (my hometown) and I speak (language besides English).

Them: Ok what age are you, do you work or are you a student?

Me:  I work in (field and general area), for my age I'll let you guess once I visit your place, I have a story to tell about that (I was planning to tell them about the time I got carded at Vegas and the bouncer thought I was under 21 to see if they could guess).

Them: Ok good I'll call you around 8pm

(Fast forward a few hours and surprise, no call)

At 9pm I text them that I didn't receive a call but I'll wait for them to text me the address and we'll set up a visit this week.

Them: Where do you work, what are you looking for and what's your age?

Me: I'm seeking a furnished room, short term to start and long term if I like it.  

Them: So you're a worker?

Me: Yes.  I've been in town for the past 2 months.  For the other questions, I work full time in (the field/general location, didn't want to give someone I never met too much info too soon)

Them:  OK good , what do you do and what's your age?

Me:  I think that's enough info for now.  

Them:  It's as you wish but just so you know ,you're not the only one and that's why I asked you all those questions.   Good luck in your search, good bye.

Me (pissed off but I probably dodged a bullet):  That's the first time I've been asked all kinds of personal questions even before meeting someone.

Them (no reply).

So what do you think reddit?  Were the ad poster's questions about where I work, what I do exactly and what my age reasonable screening questions before we even meet or intrusive?   I wasn't too happy about being told they would call at a certain time, waiting an hour beyond that and getting the silent treatment until I followed up.  ",16Oct2017,2
13,"**Venting rant inbound** (just like the drones spying on us citizens and crapping out chem clouds  **):**

People are sheep. Sheep led by a scheming and evil Shepard, Barack Hussein Obama and his herding BorderKollie, that Killarly Klinton. No one is saying anything because the Jew-run media and Shadow Masters scream over your average-moe-szyslak and everyone else who knows a good GODDAMN thing about the reality of it all is vaccinated by “HIV” needles planted (BY OUR GOVERNMENT) in movie theater seats (Nice try, Corporate News Media! ha) tracked, and then brought to FEMA camps all around The United States of America where they are never heard from again. Fuck us, right?


Why the fuck is everyone talking about puppet-president Trump, #blacklivesmatter, “police” shootings, the National Anthem, and North Korea? Those are all false fucking flags to diverge our attention and divide us into blabbering, angry, brainless babies. That is what the fear-mongering monster we call “Media” likes to fill our heads with. Fucking hysteria implanted into our culture. Had they mastered the technology yet, they’d implement that brainless fear as a hormone released through the chips they put into our kids dicks when they circumcise them. YEAH. You really think circumcision’s purpose was for our health? That is what Jews would have you believe.


&gt; “Oh, you are crazy! Why would Jews lie about circumcision for two-thousand years when the purpose you claim it has involved technology that didn’t exist then?” 

Ha! Nice **Straw Man fallacy**. If you are asking me that bovine-shit, you must be one of *THEM* too. That, or the electrolytes emitting from your digital (government spyware) devices have fried what was left of your half-functioning-but-fully-failing, troglodyte brain. If, somehow, that doesn’t apply to you, I am not going to waste my time telling you about how it all works. To sum it up, **TIME IS NOT LINEAR**.


Want proof? First of all, check your pecker for that fucking chip. I ripped mine out a while back when I learned it was planted there and when I couldn’t satisfy my girl because *“shrimp dick”* or whatever the fuck she said. Not my problem the spirits of Xenu’s supposed spaceship crew decided to possess your weak upper-body-strength-having, inferior minded kind. **That** illustrates another point your questioning-ass might have. 

&gt; “If the Government is planting chips when they circumcise kids, that only affects men, so women aren’t controlled.”
 
**Wrong.** Inferior feminine minds are on par with the submissive circumcised male populace. 
&gt; “W-what about uncircumcised men?” 

*Pft*, what about them, Stanley? The chip is still there. Doctors are sneaky and find a way. Ever seen them vaccinate a kid? They can stealth-shot that syringe into them without the poor child noticing it (assuming the kid doesn’t shrivel up immediately after all the mercury they pumped into them).   


My parents were brainwashed like everyone else and had my baby-dick (dick name still relevant today. You didn’t need to know that, but I am an honest guy. NOT that is matters. Girls don’t go for nice guys.) mutilated and rigged by a “doctor” when I was born. Second piece of the pie to fill your fat, pudding-fixated Fuck-Hole: Gwen Stefani. *No Doubt*’s *Tragic Kingdom* (no doubt that we live in such a tragic kingdom, heh) -era Gwen Stefani is OLDER than 2017-era Gwen Stefani. Get off your boy’s dick and Google a fucking picture of her with your Zune or whatever the fuck you sheeple utilize now. You think she chose Ska because that genre resonated with her and her band? **You fucking idiot.** She knows a fucking lot about the game. It was her way of SKAffing at us worms. And then the government returns us to the dirt. No-fucking-nutrient-having-dirt. That reminds me that people are like dirt. They can either nourish you and help you grow as a person (if they know these **LIES** and see through all the shit) or they can stunt your growth (like “doctors” claim to counteract) and make you wilt and die. Dead, dirty little doctor-tainted mongrels.



Honestly, fuck all of you who are unbelievers. Ever seen a fucking **Rat King**? No, not Splinter, cuckling. I’ve seen three in my life. *THREE*. For the uninitiated, a **Rat King** is (falsely labeled a cryptid) when a ~~[insert descriptive word for the massive amount of cocks that fill the empty space where coherent thoughts are supposed to generate in your head]~~ refugee-boat-load(?) of rats get their tails tangled and their bile and shit glues them together like Jews to a shekel. One massive, multi-organism cluster. Writhed, diseased, dying. Bad fucking omen.


The first one I saw was presented to me during a bad-trip-gone-worse I had after boofing a live Colorado River toad. I was listening to *Paranoid* by *Black Sabbath* (I have since learned proper set and settings for these experiences, because what a fucked up song to blast while I chase Alice down my booty-hole) when some chinless water-person, giving me the ol’ *Stanley Kubrick stare*, lifted their hand revealing a **Rat King**. His or her voice was alien. Not taco-alien. But otherworldly-alien. It spoke in shrieks and drawls. Somehow I understood. One lazy eye darting to the rats and one placed on me 
&gt; “Look on my works.” 

I lost my balance at the sight of the rats and I could feel something going back and forth in my bowels. 
&gt; “Yee-yee!” 

it shrieked, and my shit reverse fell in me. 
&gt; “Despair.” 

Well, fuck.


The third **Rat King** was the game changer. I was taking my boyfriend out to a lunch date. Yeah, what? Didn’t think I was gay? I’m open-minded, fuck you. My pineal gland got a lick or two from Lady S.D. and the *Alice Cooper* album *Dada*. We were having a romantic, lavish lunch at the one place uncorrupted by the Shadow Masters. The greasy, undeserving-of-even-minimum-wage worker at Wendy’s cash-register was humming *Das Rheingold* as we strolled in. Weird, huh? Anyways, long story short, there was a **Rat King** in my chili. What made this the game changer wasn’t the fact that it finally dropped the anvil on my acceptance of Wendy’s, no, it was the characteristics of this bad omen. I spied eighteen *Rattus norvegicus* tangled in $2 chili. Poisoned, only three yet lived. All staring at me. 18 divided by 3 is 6. Three lived. 3, 6s. 666. Bottoms up, and the Devil wins.

I am finally getting around to permanently deleting my account, so I downloaded the data so that I could still have the photos saved to my PC. I must say, 2009 FB was really weird. Statuses would appear next to the name, so many of my statuses would say something like ""John Smith Is having a great time at the party!"" Instead of something like ""I'm having a great time at the party!"" 

It was weird because now the format is completely different, so it looks like a lot of grammar mistakes. I was 13 when I got my FB account, and another thing that seems weird to me was that I would apologize for not responding to someone's comment in time, or not ""liking"" someone's status because I was afraid that they would think that I was being rude. Not to mention all the farm town (a Farmville ripoff) screenshots that I also posted for whatever reason.


This just gets me thinking about how much the internet has changed since 2009. I don't like to get overly nostalgic, but I kind of miss when Facebook was just an innocent place for friends to share details about their lives, instead of political opinions and religious viewpoints. Especially after 2016, all FB seems to be anymore is news story after news story about whatever Trump or Congress is doing. I am glad that I finally decided to get rid of my account.

23,"Yesterday was the first snow of the year and it was busy everywhere. Our shovel broke so we were going to get a new one. We get off the highway and on to the service road and end up behind a car that is trying to turn left into the Tim Horton's drive-thru. The drive-thru is absolutely full and the car in front of me is blocking traffic.

I waited for about 30 seconds and then I gave one honk hoping they would turn into the parking lot (which wasn't full) instead of the drive-thru line and stop blocking the road. They didn't react at all. So I honked a couple more times and they also didn't react/move at all.

I normally never honk and am quite patient with other road users. The last time I honked was to prevent a collision when someone was drifting into my lane and about to drive into the side of my car. I would have passed this car but right after the drive-thru is a sharp bend in the road where vehicles exit the highway and it wouldn't be safe.

Now there are 2 cars behind me on the service road and the cars turning off the highway can no longer turn left into the service road and are blocking the way for anyone going straight or right (Walmart, Grocery Store, Gas Station, Car Wash). 

About 6 cars are at an absolute standstill because this person wants their coffee. The truck behind me honks maybe 3 times. No reaction. So I honk about 10 times hoping they will get the message and look behind them. No reaction at all.

It's only when the drive-thru finally moves and this person can turn into the line that they finally do anything. I also would like to note that not one of the cars they were holding up were even going to Tim Horton's. They all drove elsewhere.

This driver was inconsiderate and oblivious to 6 cars behind them that were trying to go places. It was rude and also absolutely not legal (there are signs). But here is where I feel conflicted. They probably think that **I** am mean and impatient and a bully. I just got frustrated by their selfish behaviour and wanted to get a message to them that they should be more considerate.

My husband says it doesn't matter and not to worry about things so much. He agrees that I should have honked because the person wouldn't know they were doing anything wrong if i didn't. 

I do tend to overthink things and hope that I always do the right thing. I still can't help but feel a bit guilty for honking. Thoughts?",16Oct2017,1

My problem is that I want to be someone, but these to grown men are insisting on getting me into trouble, by bumping into me in the hall of our mommas house, by trying to force my hand thru yelling at me and calling me names.

This is nothing new. It’s mental abuse and it’s been happening for my whole life while they’ve been around, but the last ten years have been hell on earth for me. 

My sister tries to maintain a neutral position in the family, but naturally she always sides with momma. And I’ve been broken by them on many occasions, but I’m tired of fighting back. It got physical once and I almost went to jail over it but now they can’t seem to let me be. Always waiting for the moments when I’m on my way to my bedroom, to walk to the kitchen so they can bump me into the wall. Or wait until momma leaves to start trash talking me and her. 

I wish I could keep quiet but I’m hurting both physically and emotionally. My blood pressure goes thru the roof around them and I’m done trying to understand why they’re like that to me.

I hang around with the same group of 5 guys every single weekend. I'm the only one at college, they're all in dead end jobs. I'm often the butt of jokes in the group, and while I know it's always never meant to be hurtful and comes from a good place, I feel like sometimes they just see me as a joke. They always joke about how I'm a virgin and girls never go for me, which I'm not gonna lie, I am insecure about. It makes me feel like some kind of joke or something. It goes kinda deeper than that though. I'm a small guy who's always cracking jokes. People always tell me I'm really upbeat. I don't think people actually take me seriously in general. They just see me as some little jokester or something. I love my friends though, and I've known them for years man. They're all I've got, and I know deep down we care a shit ton about each other.

We go out drinking every weekend, with coke thrown into the mix a lot and molly a few times more recently. A year ago I had never touched alcohol let alone this shit, and while I'm not worried about my personal use at all, I can see some of my friends get more dependent on it, insisting that 'you're only young once' and all that shit. And while I agree you should want to have a good time, it's leaving some of them with no money and a growing want for it. Most of them really crave coke if we're out without it now. It's terrifying. I feel like to some extent I'm doing it as well just to dull how shitty I feel sometimes, which I know is a slippery slope.

The subjects I do at college I do because they sounded interesting, but it's not as interesting as I thought and I know after it I'll have no career prospects and a shit ton of debt. I have no friends at college, everyone always seems so full of themselves at my college cause it's hard to get into. People kind of act like they're above you. But even then, I can't even socialise anymore properly. I don't know HOW to make friends anymore. It seems fucking impossible. I've become so anti-social with new people and I get worried over the simplest things when talking to people. It's pathetic.

The only person who consistently gets me through is this girl I know who I am really close with. I work with her, we go to college together, we talk like everyday from the minute we wake up until we go to sleep. She's someone I know genuinely enjoy a being around me, which is one of the only things that makes me feel good. Obviously, being the only girl who cares about me and one of the only people who never treats me like I'm some kind of joke and actually gets me, I've fell completely head over heels for her. And while being around her makes me really happy, it's also fucking painful. She has a boyfriend, and I'm all too aware how stupid I look hanging around a girl who doesn't like me that way like some lost puppy. I feel like I'm being a 'Nice Guy', just hanging around hoping one day I'll get with her and getting progressively more bitter. I don't want to be like that.

Today it really just hit how pathetic I've got. I met up with this girl at college, and she was with her other friends. I chilled with them for a couple of hours, but I felt really self-aware of how her other friends must view me when they know her boyfriend. Anyway, she was like constantly talking about her boyfriend to them for a good while, and I felt jealous as fuck. She seems so into him, and it just felt like I was getting punched in the gut with realising I'm not gonna get with her. This guy treats her like fucking royalty and I'm an aimless piece of shit with no prospects. She told me how some guy in her class asked to walk her to the subway, but she said told him she was in a rush. She joked about how she thought the guy had a thing for her, but didn't want to seem big headed by telling him she had a boyfriend. I laughed, but realise I'm basically doing the exact same fucking thing and somewhere deep down she probably knows that too. She was telling me about how some guy we work with was forced to admit on shift that's he's a virgin in front of everyone and how she felt bad for him. I laughed along, but I felt even more stupid for acting like I'm something I'm not in front of her. I mean I am too, I didn't want to just correct her when she assumed I wasn't in front of all her friends. I dunno, typing it out doesn't seem like a big deal, but I just kinda was getting hit with the reality of how I feel and how it's not gonna work, and all the faults I have that would stop it and it made me feel like utter shit.

So basically that got me thinking, and holy shit, I'm just not a good person anymore. Like for real: 

**(TL;DR)** I don't even try in college, I go out every weekend getting aimlessly drunk and high. I struggle to get out my bed and do basic shit, I have no goals. No prospects. My friends, hell probably a larger amount of people see me as some kind of walking talking joke and maybe I am to some extent. I'm a virgin who's never had a girlfriend. The one girl who doesn't really see me as a joke I cling to like a bad smell hoping maybe one day shit will change between us, but knowing it never will. And besides, I'd never want to drag her down to what I am now. She's got goals, a nice relationship, hopes and dreams. I want her to do well. I don't want her to be stuck with a piece of shit like me. My life honestly just sucks so bad and I don't like who I'm becoming at all. I just don't know where shit went so wrong.",16Oct2017,8
39,"Male, 22, american. Only had one relationship, and that was when I was 15-16. Tried starting another at 21 and she ghosted me out of nowhere. So, still a virgin at almost 23 years old. I have had depression and anxiety for most my life, was homeschooled through middle and high school, got an associates degree but dropped out of college while working on bachelor's. Employed, but not good enough to be a career. Living with grandparents. Below average height, 5'6. Raised in a Christian household but now atheist. Still, it severely limited the kinds of real world social interaction I got outside of pre-approved church-y events.

Anyway, with the laundry list of excuses out of the way, I need help. I've spent alot of time improving myself. Emotionally and mentally, I've got my depression under control and physically I've made improvements. Not toned, but fairly average weight, maybe a bit extra. Still self-conscious about it I suppose but much better than it used to be. Hair cut more to a normal length and ditched the ""emo kid"" hair that I had for so long. So while there's improvements still to be made, I feel I'm in control of my own life enough to venture out and meet people. Only thing is, I suck at meeting people. I can socialize with people I know, no anxiety and minimal awkwardness, but I don't know how to open conversation with strangers, don't know even where to go or what to do to meet people. The goal, of course, is women, but even just meeting some guys to hang out with would be something, help me get more comfortable in social settings if nothing else. I don't have coworkers my age, and didn't stay in contact with anyone from college, so I've got no connections to branch out from. I'm socially dead in the water.

I need help building a social life from the ground up. Sorry for the rant.",16Oct2017,6

43,"I worked for a little over a month straight without days off, saving and pinching every penny I could. I saved over $2800 to move myself into an apartment of my own. I couldn’t have been more proud of myself. I’ve been in said apartment for about three and a half days. Only to find out it’s roach infested. I don’t know what to do. I can’t live like this.  At this point, I’d rather take an eviction. ",16Oct2017,13
44,"I know it's a hard question to answer, but I just want to write my thoughts down. So I'm a kinda awkward guy who's a little shy (although it has gotten better over the years) additionally I'm 18 years old, average looking and I'm doing well in school. I've never been in a relationship because I was too shy to talk to my crush or because I turned others down. 2 weeks ago that changed and I finally had the balls to aks my crush out and well she turned me down. She is good looking, intelligent, very nice and just like me somewhat shy. The two girls that are most important in my life and that have a crush on me are my best friend (we've knwon each other for ~15 years) and another good friend who I've known for about ~1,5 years. My friend of 15 years is like a sister to me so I just can't imagine dating her. My other friend, now she's good looking and quite interested (and well read) in chemistry, which I admire (because I suck at it). So she's very open (and direct) about the fact that she likes me but I just can't see myself with her. Is it because I still kinda want my crush to like me back? Or because she said some borderline biphobic stuff and I'm bi (not out yet though)? Or because I think that it just doesn't fit? Like I don't know why exactly I wouldn't date her and it makes me think that I'm too picky and too fixated on my crush. I don't even know if this is just about too high standards. Thanks for reading all of it, sorry for the formatting (I'm on mobile), and sorry if the text is hard to read I'm dyslexic and I have problems writing down my thoughts properly.",16Oct2017,3

47,"I've lost 3 jobs this calendar year. I'm a crippling alcoholic, I sleep for hours and hours and starve myself. But not even because I think I need to. I just do. I don't remember to eat, or I just sit through the hunger pains because why the fuck not? I posted my naked body on GW subreddits(alt acct.) and not a single person up-voted my photo. I feel incredibly low and useless to the point where I don't even contemplate suicide anymore because I know I'd fuck it up. I just kind of sit around waiting for a car accident or house fire to start. My therapist has ""called out sick"" the last five months in a row the morning of my appointment. Honestly, I feel like he's avoiding me at this point. It's too many times for coincidence. Maybe if i drink myself into oblivion I'll just die in my sleep. Today I got my boyfriends ex girlfriends mail again at our house. She used to live here. Her body was incredibly popular on reddit. I just wanted to be better at one thing than her. At least she's on heroin now and her mail is mainly collection agencies. Silver lining, right? I literally hate myself. I don't remember the last time I looked in the mirror and felt happy to see who I was. And not even physically. I look in the mirror and see who I am, the things I've said, the things that have been said to me. I don't even know why I put makeup on everyday anymore. Or shower, or brush my teeth. I guess it's habit. I guess it also has something to do with not wanting people to find out, because being depressed just annoys people. No one wants to be around someone who fucking hates themselves. I feel bad for my boyfriend too. he loves me and lets me know all the time but I don't believe him or anyone else. It makes me feel even worse too because he tries to help but then get frustrated and disappointed because I don't give a flying fuck what he says. 

Sorry I guess. I just needed to get it out. I wish I loved myself but honestly I'd settle with tolerating myself.",16Oct2017,6
48,"Hey dudes! For the past eight or nine years I've made a living traveling the US having drugs tested on me. I live in my car for much of the year as I shift around the country in search of money, love, and warm weather. I'm a writer and have written extensively about travel and strange encounters. Here's a piece I wrote about living in my car in Austin, sharing french fries from the garbage with a topless and obese homeless lady, and trying to bang a bunch of Craigslist strangers.

51,"I'm not the kind of person that wants to hide from the bad things happening in the world, but it seems like r/news and r/worldnews frequently features the worst of the worst. The top posts are often made up of who has been most brutally raped or murdered in whatever corner or the world. When that's all there is, it's really fucking depressing just to try to read the news in the morning and find out what's happening in the world. Yes, I realize there's r/upliftingnews and that negativity is sort of the nature of news in this day and age, but I want to know what of consequence is happening in the world (good or bad). I'd just maybe like the first thing I see not to be how x number of babies were burned alive somewhere today. From now on I'll be sticking to my Google news feed and certain other news outlets.",16Oct2017,1
52,"When my now ex girlfriend told me that she will go for a few months in a foreign country I collapsed emotionally. The back story is that I was lonely for 2 years and this was my first time I've been so happy and with someone. My previous relationship ended because of my jealousy when she got abroad, and now everything was about to happen again. 

I didn't want to loose her, and I was so terrified of this happened again, I didn't know what to do about it, I just got very depressed. This resulted in the worst week ever. No calls, no texts, she didn't even saw my messages. The weekend I cried and got through this, until she called me and told me that this relationship was not going to work.

Worst of all she is right. I really killed that relationship because of my stupid jealousy because of which I panicked and closed myself in the deepest hole. 

I really want to be in a relationship, but I can't hold myself and that jealousy when someone is going to be separate from me. ",16Oct2017,2
