3,"I've known my best friend for over 12 years. I consider her like a sister in a lot of ways and I care about her very deeply, but I've long struggled with the fact that she is a massive flake, selfish, and also has problems dealing with her anger/self-entitlement. In the early days I'd tell her I was upset when she constantly bailed last minute on plans or just went AWOL for days, and her instant reaction was to snap at me - It's 'never her fault'. She is extremely stubborn and quick to jump to the offence if anyone challenges her so, being much more timid as a teenager, I just learnt not to bring it up anymore.

She's always lived at home with her parents in a small village outside of town, she got a job as a salaried teaching assistant straight out of college and has stayed there ever since. I left home after college, lived in town for a while, went between shitty retails jobs, then for various reasons I moved away to a neighbouring town. She said she understood and we promised to still see each other on a regular basis, and kept in touch by phone/online, and even though I've had periods where I was living on little to no income I've always been the one arranging plans or trying to scrape together the money to visit for a weekend. She always seems to lament that she needs to come visit me more often, but has done so approximately once in the 5 years since I've moved. 

We each live less than an hour from our main hometown, except for her it's a bus that costs £3.00 and for me it's a train that costs £24. More often than not she will flake out last minute or come up with multiple excuses why she can't afford it/meet me halfway (often when I'm already on the train) until I literally have to resort to coming all the way to her doorstep.

When I suggest making plans I constantly hear the excuse: 'Oh I really want to but I'm skint at the moment', yet I have never been able to figure out where all her money goes. Quite honestly, in her situation she only pays a little housekeeping and I've heard her talk about the running debt she has with her mum, who also cooks all her meals. She doesn't drive, has no kids or other life commitments, yet she always seems to be buying designer clothes, shoes and make-up (I'm talking Chanel, Gucci, rare imports from overseas, those monthly gift crates and God knows what else). She paid £800 for a freaking German Shepherd puppy without telling her parents even though they already had 2 dogs and can barely look after those, and I recently found out she hasn't even got insurance on the dog because 'it's so expensive'. She's constantly loaning money from her older brothers to pay back her multiple debts in some endless loop of negative balance and using that as an excuse for not being able to afford doing things. To top it off she even has a credit card which I've seen her use on nights out numerous times and I have no idea how she even got in the first place.

Anyway back to the friendship. These days she's been going through some depression so I try to be there for her as much as I can, I'll text her back as soon as possible, let her know my schedules if she needs anything etc. She knows I work 9-5 Monday through Friday and I only have a half hour lunch break anywhere between midday and 1pm but sometimes she'll randomly try to call me at like 10am or 3pm and there's only so many times I can take personal calls away from my desk, so I have to text back reminding her when I'm on lunch/finished and that I'll call her at that time. I've been in meetings before when she's called so I've had to reject it only to have a voicemail of her sobbing incoherently, which obviously makes me panic because she then often won't respond when I try to call her back and it turns out she's fine but just needed to vent.

As a general rule, whenever I initiate a phone call to her I'll 99% get her voicemail, even if she's told me in advance that she's free. The times I do get through she'll often interrupt me to have a conversation with someone else, walk away from the phone and leave me waiting, or she'll ask me when's a good time to call back and I won't hear from her again for days. Despite this whenever I see her she is absolutely glued to her phone, and she'll often be texting someone whilst I'm talking to her. 

I lost my phone over the Christmas period and put a post up on Facebook letting people know. We were supposed to be meeting up for New Years' but since I didn't have my usual methods of contacting her I assumed she would go through Facebook to confirm our plans - it took 10 days for her to think to message me, after New Years' has gone by, to ask if I'm OK. I didn't go to her first just to see what would happen, and I guess I found out.

4,"Following on from my [previous post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/5lp0ec/my_crazy_friend_pt_1/).

Late last autumn my friend told me she'd got involved with a boy much younger than herself, let's call him Boy, who is a friend of her family. When they met he was barely 18 (but very mature according to her) and because of her profession they had to keep it a secret from everyone. It's safe to say I personally don't like Boy. He is immature, lazy, cocky, and treats her badly - whenever I speak to her nowadays she always seems to be crying over him/in the middle of a huge fight/declaring they're over, but the next minute she's inviting him over to her house or arranging to spend time with him. She asks for my advice and I tell her I honestly think he's no good for her and she agrees, but then just carries right on.

Shortly after this all began was when she confessed to me that she'd started going to the doctor for depression. Now I've suffered from anxiety and depression for most of my adult life and she has been (mostly) there for me through the worst times so I felt now was my turn to step up and support her. By this point I'm much better off financially so I've been available to travel at short notice and be physically there for her whenever she needs me. She frequently talks about how much she wants to get away and spend time with me and our close mutual friend who we rarely see because she lives way up North, and I've tried multiple times since last Winter to arrange a holiday away for the three of us after I offered to research and book everything. First she gave me the age-old 'oh I'm skint until payday' excuse so we postponed it. The next time I brought it up she said she had plans to go to the beach with Boy for 3 days, and then all of a sudden she decided to go to Spain with some of her work friends for a week and 'didn't know when she'd have the money to see us'. 

Mutual's birthday rolled around in the Spring so we decided to plan a night out for the occasion, and think about a 'big' holiday later - she was unsurprisingly skint again and of course it's far too much effort for her to go up North even though Mutual offered to host us at her place, but she agreed to come down to our hometown and I paid for my friend and I to stay in the same hotel and have dinner and cocktails. Despite doing all this to suit her, the entire weekend my friend was texting Boy and barely looked up from her phone.

Fast forward to several weeks later we had arranged to meet up in our hometown, and on the way there she texted saying sorry but she couldn't get the bus to meet me and would I mind coming to her village. I got all the way out there and couldn't see her at the bus stop so I waited, rang and got her voicemail a couple of times. Eventually she called me back in tears and asked if I could just come to her house. Her mum let me in and I found her in her bedroom sobbing, surrounded by broken glass - she had another fight with Boy and smashed her mirror in a fit of rage. I helped her clean up and while we were talking she was on her phone non-stop texting again, then her mood did a 180 and she randomly asked if I minded someone else coming over. Apparently she'd been getting chatty with a friend of Boy's, same age as him, and she invited him over in some sort of twisted revenge plot. He ended up staying the night in her bed while she and I shared her older brother's room and during the night I heard her leave and not come back in. In the morning when I went to find her I walked in on them half-naked in bed all over each other. 

She acted like everything was fine and he actually hung around all morning, even getting the bus back to town with us to get breakfast. After he left I had a bit of a go at her and she broke down - I told her I was worried that she was only hurting herself, and she agreed she needed to sort things out. Not a week later I heard she'd arranged to go camping with her older brothers, Boy and *Boy's friend* - none of whom know about what's going on with the others. Not only that, but I know for a fact she has always hated camping and after the trip she called me to rant about how the whole thing had been a disaster and she wished she'd never gone.

It was my birthday in the Summer, and over a month beforehand I put the idea out there on our group chat that I was thinking of organising a lunch in London - my friend piped up to say she loved the idea and had seen a gig in the area that same night, so she was excited about the three of us going in the evening after lunch and then suggested staying in a hotel. I wondered how she expected to afford this and already knew she would probably wait until the last minute to say she was skint so one of us would offer to put up for her, but she at least assured me she was free that weekend and would put it in her diary so it was definitely open. The three of us used a shared calendar app at the time and about a week before my birthday I noticed she had quietly added a new event on that weekend.

She didn't show up on our group chat for a couple of days after and then out of the blue she called to say hi, but didn't mention anything about the weekend. I brought it up and asked if she was still available and she fumbled with some excuse about how Boy had invited her to Brighton but she'd got the dates mixed up so she'd 'have to check but will let me know'. I didn't hear back from her so I just went to the pub with another group of friends on my birthday instead.

In early December I had agreed to house-sit for my friend while her and the family were at her brother's wedding for the weekend. They have 3 dogs, 2 cats and chickens in the garden which needed looking after. One of the dogs, a little terrier, was extremely old - they had him since before I knew my friend and even then he was no spring chicken. He had terribly diseased skin and no fur, or fat on his skeletal little body; he was incontinent, totally deaf and blind to the point his eyes actually shrivelled up and all he did was shuffle around your feet, dribble piss and bump into things and whine. It wasn't pleasant to look at him suffering yet they didn't do anything about it, just wrapped him in a blanket to avoid touching him and put him in a corner in his basket which was lined with nappy pads for hygiene.

My journey plan was to get a train to my hometown at 7.30am in order to make a bus to my friend's village to get to her house before 9am, which is when her parents were leaving. She was getting a lift with Boy and had gone up the night before to stay at her SIL's house. (I later found out Boy didn't even stay that night in the house with my friend, he slept in his car on the street outside because she hadn't thought ahead about asking, and he waited around until the wedding was over so he could drive her home again. I actually felt really bad for him and ashamed at my friend for making him do that).

On the morning when I had got off the train to get my connecting bus I realised the timetable was different to the one I looked up online, and apparently a bus wasn't showing up for over an hour. I started to freak out and tried calling and texting my friend asking if she knew what bus timetable I should be going by, she didn't reply so I ended up researching a bunch of other routes and had to get a train back the way I'd come to get off at a station inbetween and a different bus which fortunately got me to the village in time for me to run to her house and only be about 10 minutes late. I was so apologetic and her parents were super grateful and thanked me for making the effort to come all the way. As they were leaving her mum mentioned that their old dog had not been well and was suffering from some diarrhoea, but he shouldn't make a mess and if I put him outside regularly he would go in the garden.

After settling the animals, about half an hour in I went to make a cup of tea and noticed I could smell shit - I walked into the kitchen and the old dog had got out of his basket and was stood in a big puddle of liquid diarrhoea right on the kitchen floor. It was the most horrendous thing I had smelt in my life and I had to pick up the dog and plop him outside without his blanket because I couldn't wrap it around him without dipping it in the shit, so he's out there shivering because it's a freezing cold day and I have no idea where they keep the cleaning products. I have to hunt around trying not to breathe in too deeply, meanwhile the other two dogs (a big boxer and a hyper German Shepherd) are fighting their way through to sniff the puddle and I'm trying to stop them from licking it off the floor. I manage to shut them in their pen, find a load of newspaper to put down, get the other dog in and stand him on the paper with his blanket, meanwhile I can only find a bottle of Mr Muscle and a roll of kitchen towels so that has to do for now because I'm about to pass out from the smell. The paper towels become saturated and disintegrate in my hand as soon as I start trying to mop up the puddle and there are no rubber gloves, so I get a black bag and invert it around my hand, then start grabbing wads of newspaper to soak up the majority of it. I spray the area with the Mr Muscle and use the balled-up newspaper to scrub it in, and the wet paper towels from before start congealing into a brown paste-like consistency that just smears around the floor. I go through an entire Sunday Times cleaning up the mess until eventually it's spotless, cram all the wet papers into the black bag and put it outside, wipe down the dog and settle him back in his basket.

Every 10-15 minutes I stick my head around the kitchen door to check on the terrier and put him outside incase he needs to go, and he seems fine - but **3 more times** he manages to get out of his basket, dribble piss for a few inches and then pass liquid shit all over the same spot mere minutes after I've brought him back in. I got so paranoid after the second time that I rooted out a bunch more newspapers and essentially covered every inch of the kitchen floor between his basket and the back door with it, which made the 3rd time easier but no less disgusting to clean up.

By the evening I'm convinced I can smell shit in every room of the house and it lingers with me despite checking every nook and cranny of the kitchen to make sure I hadn't missed any. The dog has settled in for the night and will probably sleep right through till morning so I finally relax and decide to put a movie on. As I'm getting up to get some snacks I hear the distinct sound of retching coming from the hallway where the other two dogs are penned in - I run out there just in time to see the big boxer standing in the middle of the hall, heaving, then vomiting all over the floor. Round 5 of cleaning and I'm exhausted so decide to call it a night.

In the morning I do the rounds with the animals, scroll Facebook for a while and go for a walk to the shops. I'm starting to wonder what time they'll be back, since no-one really told me and I have work the next day so didn't want to leave too late. It gets to the afternoon and I eventually hear from my friend checking how things are going. I ask what their plan is and after checking she says sorry but her parents have only just left and it'll take them about 2 hours to get home. I ask if she's with them and she says no, she got a lift back with Boy but if I want to I can leave before her parents get home and meet them in town to go watch a film. I said I'd wait and see because I feel bad leaving the dogs, and since the buses run less frequently on Sundays I won't be able to go anywhere for a couple of hours now anyway.

About an hour goes by and her parents and two older brothers arrive home earlier than expected, I chat with them for a bit, have a cup of tea and her brother offers to give me a lift back to town so I happily agree. He also says that he had my friend's handbag in his car with her purse in, so I call my friend letting her know that I'll meet them in town, and did she want me to bring her purse since it's here. She says great and asked if I can grab a few other things to bring to her. I'm like sure why not, what do you need? She lists off a bunch of stuff including a pair of trainers, perfume, her headphones, then pauses for a minute and says 'oh yeah and my medication, woops'. I tell her dude, seriously you haven't taken any medication, you really need to be more careful, and she just laughs and says 'I know I'm such an airhead, teehee!' I'm practically hitting my head against the wall from exasperation and tell her we're heading there now. 

I grab all her stuff in a carry bag and on the way her brother tells me she got so drunk at the after party that she passed out so they carried her to boy's car and he assumes he drove her home. He picked up her bag because she left it behind. I assumed they were on the way back when I spoke to her earlier, but he doesn't know anymore than I do. He drops me off in the centre of town and I thank him before texting my friend to let her know I'm there. 

After wandering around for ten minutes she texts me and says sorry they'll be another twenty minutes (surprise surprise), so I decide to go into the mall to do some shopping. As I'm paying for a new game that I've been wanting the last thing I need is for my debit card to decline multiple times. I start panicking because I know how much I should have in my account, plus I need to get a train home and no cash so if the card's broken I'm screwed. At this point my phone starts buzzing and I pick up as I'm rushing to the cashpoint to check my account, and my friend says they're in the mall carpark and could I hurry over to meet them there. Confused I ask why she can't just come to me, and she gets snappy and says 'I'm not wearing any shoes right now and you have my trainers, I don't want to walk bare foot'. I explain that my card isn't working and I potentially can't pay to get home so she'll have to wait and she begrudgingly agrees to come to me.

Luckily I was still able to withdraw cash which was a relief, my friend got her shoes and I went back to buy my game so all was well. I asked her what happened at the wedding and that I heard she'd got drunk and no-one knew where she went, and she told me Boy had driven her all the way back to his house last night which is *in town* and she'd spent the night there. She only had her high-heels and no change of clothes (still doesn't explain why she forgot her medication but whatever) and had left her handbag behind in all the mess. So even though she was literally 5 minutes drive away from town she was obviously too hungover to get up when she knew I was on my way, made me wait around, then snapped at me for not being there the second she needed her damn shoes.

When it got late and I said I needed to be heading off, Boy agreed and my friend realised she hadn't bothered to check the bus times back to her house. It turns out there wasn't a bus for another hour and half but Boy and I were ready to go in different directions, so she just stood there and said 'oh' apparently waiting for one of us to offer to hang around with her. Eventually he caved and said 'I guess I could give you a lift' and she gleefully skipped off with him. I just sighed and went home.

Later that evening I got a text saying that their old dog had died, and I still haven't gotten over the feeling that somehow it was my fault, even though she told me her mum knew he was about to go any minute. :(",03Jan2017,1
12,So I'm in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend and she hasn't been texting me or calling me though I have done so many times and she won't reply so do you think she's just not receiving my messages or she's ignoring me ,03Jan2017,1
13,"So around two years ago I decided to retire my then ~8 year old Toshiba laptop (Vista), and I bought a ""cheap"" HP 15-r132something.  The laptop came with Windows 8, and other than it having a lot of useless features the OS worked fine for me.  And then Windows 10 came.

Being the curious cat that I am, I decided to upgrade to Windows 10 before the free upgrade was discontinued.  After the upgrade, the computer showed some minor/annoying issues with the brightness settings being fucked up or the touchpad settings not saving after a shut down and such.  Annoying, but ignorable.

Then I decided to play Torchlight/Hearthstone on it.  The laptop tended to crash when playing any of those games and I just attributed it to overheating.  I did find it odd that the laptop would overheat so easily when I was running stuff like Portal/DS2 in my 8 year old laptop, so I opened the thing up and that's when I noticed that the laptop had no fan in it.  A ~$500 machine from 2014 has no cooling fan.  I didn't even know that was a thing.  I thought a fan was indispensable, kinda like how a car is expected to have a radiator fan.

So, no games for me.  I switch hobbies from playing games to just browsing reddit and looking at memes and then it happens again.  The computer hangs and no amount of ctrl+alt+del will budge the thing.  But since it only happens once every few weeks I choose to ignore it.  Until a few weeks ago.

The crashes increased in frequency to the point that it would happen 3-4 times in a single day for no discernible reason.  I finally get around to running the uefi component tests and the HD fails it.  Fuck.  In a bid of desperation I back up some of the files I've been using the most and decide to attempt a clean reinstall.  I mean, maybe it's just Windows 10 being a bitch?  Maybe the system files were corrupted since the time I upgraded to Windows 10?

Well after deleting/formatting all partitions, the Windows 10 installation spitted out an error about certain files not being available and then I was left with a fucked up HD and no OS installed.  Thankfully I had my trusty Toshiba handy and managed to install Ubuntu into the fucked up HD.  I ran the smart test on the disk again and apparently, the disk fails the Airflow Temperature assessment.  Well, what a coincidence.  

So now the question is, is the HD fucked? Or is the fact that the computer has no fan fucking with the HD? If I buy a new HD, will the computer with no fan fuck the new HD up again?  Why did my re-installation of Windows 10 fail when Ubuntu installed with no problem? And why the fuck are companies manufacturing laptops with no fucking fan when just browsing reddit will cause them to overheat?  

tl;dr - When buying laptops, make sure it has a cooling fan. ",03Jan2017,1

Over the summer he went to visit me and we had a sleepover, after that we usually kept in touch with each other on Facebook and talked less and less and by the middle of 6th grade we stopped talking completely. Ever since then my social life has been getting worse and worse, I kept losing friends and now I am one of the least popular kids in school. I have a few friends but they do not feel very close. You know how at lunch every table is usually occupied by a group of friends and everyone belongs at one of those tables? I do not belong in any, my grades are bad too.

It feels like all of this happend because of my best friend moving away, he felt like a brother. You may just think ""try talking on Facebook again"" but he deleted his account and has no other social media account that I know of and I cannot contact his parents because it is the same situation with them.

I can only get away from my emotionally-suffocating parents by working full-time or staying up late and waiting for them to sleep. Neither options are great for my mental and physical health, and I'm doing both.

I've also been contemplating losing weight, but the moment I make the decision to start slowly (replace snacking with drinking tea and go for more walks) my brain crunches down on me and I'm hit with intense anxiety: self-criticism that I'm too fat, claims that I'll look weird once I slim down, claims that I'd look better if I gained a little weight instead, thoughts that I'm just gross and any attempts are futile, and my mother's voice in the back of my head nagging me that ""I'm never going to be able to fit into my pants.""

My back is sore, my chest is tight, and every slight startle or irritating noise makes me feel like I'm about to experience some kind of internal nuclear meltdown.

My family (mom, dad, sister, and I) is poor. Not near poverty level, but definitely not even close to lower-middle class income. My parents are also immigrants from Asia.

My dad has been caught cheating with another person. He still lives with us because he helps provide rent. We can't move out because finding an affordable place to stay is difficult in Vancouver. But aside from that he doesn't interact with us and stays in the room the entire day (except for work).

My sister is 18 and graduated high school. She believes she is ""grown up"" yet doesn't have a job. She's been going out a lot with friends and her boyfriend and sometimes doesn't even come home until the day after.

My mom has been the backbone of the family for years. She mainly does the cleaning and groceries and I try to help out whenever I can. I want to provide a good life for her but I'm a piece of shit son.

***the problem***

Very recently, my sister and mom got into a fight. My mom was yelling at my sister about how she doesn't return phone calls or texts so that my mom can know where she is. The fight escalated to the point where my mom was calling my sister a hooker and that she should just move out. My mom is not the best at keeping her temper. My sister retaliated by flipping a table and telling my mom that she should just die. I should mention that my mom has some depression issues but hasn't gotten any help about it. After the fight, my mom just broke down crying and saying that she should commit suicide because she can't handle it anymore. I've tried talking to her and asking for her to get counselling but she wants to keep this an issue kept in the family.
I'm only 20 and my first week of college starts soon and I don't know what to do. Someone help me. I feel so helpless...

My mom wants to commit suicide because she is tired of dealing with my sister and dad",03Jan2017,10

32,"I'm 18. I grew up with the internet and had a pretty nice childhood of playing video games on the PS2 and on the internet. By the time I was fully sentient, it was the early 2010s, and most of the old internet communities were in decline. Now we have a handful of user-driven sites (i.e. reddit) and a handful of social media sites, and the community aspect feels like it's drying up with the death of forums.

But there's more than that. I grew up with the 2008 crash and my parents being unemployed. Trump will step foot into the White House before I step foot into college. Inequality grows, international politics gets worse each year, and political division has spiked with the rise of identity politics. On the artistic side of things, there's less now too. My favorite genres (Indie/Alternative Rock) were booming in the 2000s but are now much less prevalent. All the great cultural commentators and new authors faded away.

How will these years be remembered? Silicon Valley? Apps like Pokemon GO and Uber? That cold, minimalist aesthetic? Social media fights? Political uncertainty?

I know nostalgia clouds the mind, but it's almost upsetting that I have to grow up in such an alien and boring time period. Does anyone else feel this way? Am I wrong?",03Jan2017,15

We hooked up a few years back, while he was broken up with his girlfriend, and they got back together so that was it. Then they broke up again, and we hooked up again. But it's weird, because he's younger than me, and has been in a monogamous thing for years now, and is showing his oats, having hooked up with at least two of my friends. So it's not going to go anywhere, and I'm not going to compete with my friends over it, but I'm like, listening for him and trying to be around when he is.

42,"How much time do you have?

First of all, you don't try to make me be a better person, you just make me want to be a better person. This is a characteristic that I hold very near and dear to me because it means that while you accept me for who I am, you still motivate me to want to do better without making me feel like right now I am not worthwhile.

The most important thing in the world to me is that the people around me are sincere. From what I can tell, I have no reason to suspect that you have ever told a lie and if you are a liar, you must be an extremely good one because every single thing you have ever said to me just seems to sincerely compassionate, understanding and kind. I have never met someone in my life who so genuinly has so much love in their heart.

Speaking of compassion, understanding, and kindness, I believe you have so much to teach me about all of these things. These are all things that I know I lack very much. I suppose this is a synthesis of my first two points; it isn't just that you yourself are so loving - you are literally such a warm, loving person that you make me envious and want to one day be at least half as loving as you are. Every move I make and every action I consider, I wonder to myself what you think about it. I've been much less of a dirtbag lately because I always think about how would you feel if you found out I did a certain thing, and if I think it would make you feel negatively, I don't do it. No one else makes me feel this way about my actions.

Every morning I wake up and I lay in bed for half an hour to an hour wishing so desperately that you were right next to me, so I could be talking to you and holding you instead of talking on facebook and holding my phone. Every night before I go to bed I do the same. Throughout the day, I don't think I go more than 10 minutes without thinking about you.

Whenever I feel upset, sad, trapped, or anything else that someone would consider negative, I open up my phone and look at a picture of you and suddenly everything bad in life flushes away. I instantly get butterflies in my stomach and feel better about the world knowing that you are a part of it.

Whether we end up together or not, our friendship is very precious to me and I can already tell that I am going to cherish it for a long time.",03Jan2017,9
44,"This started a year or so ago with my friend Jake, Jake and I we best buds; played on the baseball team together, had a great time whenever we hung out, went to school together etc. But due to personal issues at home, I had to move and live with my father. We still kept in touch texting each other on how we are doing and all, and while I was gone he got a girlfriend he wanted me to meet. I was generally OK with it especially since it meant my friend was finally happy. Now when I first met her, I thought she was OK but at times rude, making fun of us( Jake's friends) when we said nothing to initiate this sort of behavior. I thought it was funny since she did it to everyone, but overtime it became only me who would be insulted. I once brought up how someone I knew had AIDS and she had the nerve to comment: "" [My name] you're a lot like AIDS only people actually pay attention to AIDS"". Completely uncalled for. Whenever he called me she would talk in the background with more insults and I would act like I didn't here those such as: "" Jaquelin would never fuck him! Why would anyone fuck him!"" Somehow she even knows about how I've had issues with my own self-esteem and how I've had suicidal thoughts, and made comments I dare not repeat about me within that subject
. And to top it all off, whenever Jake and I try to hangout, she is also there I never get to see my friend anymore basically because any conversation I try to have with him she just butts in with either a rude comment or something else to distract Jake from what I was talking to him about. I've told him about how rude she was before but whenever I'm with him I just go along with it because I'd rather him be happy than have him to myself. Is there something I should do?",03Jan2017,9

I want to know if I can become an architect.

I know this might be a missed opportunity but I have to ask either way.

I'm 28 in February, have a degree in computer science, work as a programmer in a design company, and live in London too. I was one of those kids who never knew what they wanted to do and kind of fell into programming. I'm okay but I don't think I can say I have a passion for it. However, over the last few years I've kind of had my eyes opened up and think I realise, if I could go back in time, I'd of wanted to become an architect. It's probably too late for me to be thinking about a career change like this, but I really have to ask to put my mind at ease and I don't know who else to ask for an honest answer.

Any advice at all is welcome (and thanks in advance).

TL;DR

I want to work as an architect. Is it too late for me?

51,"So I'll start at the beginning. The very beginning. I was a big guy, like 130kg big at my heaviest. This was tough for me as it make me insecure, shy and unconfident.

In 2015, my dad died from heart attack and this was a massive wake up call that I need to change my lifestyle. Still working on myself, I am now 88kg but still shy and see my self as unattractive.

I jumped on Tinder mid last year to help me open up and get out of my shell. Though my first encounter is one that I will always remember. Things got a little heated, I was still a virgin and I told the girl that. She said she will help out and guide me through it and not to be shy. Though when it came to it, I couldn't get hard or even stay hard. My mind was distracted by the world around me, what she is thinking, and if I would be any good. This truly fucked me up and made me super self conscious as I awkwardly left soon after and we never spoke again.

I decided to invest in some Viagra from online suppliers. My next few encounters weren't too bad with its help. I was able to stay hard though it would take me ages to finish. Ages, like over an hour. Though still my mind I wouldn't be focused and my thoughts would continually wander.

After some research I thought it was porn and masturbating so I started nofap. It made me super horny everyday though I still had the same issue.

After having a friend's with benefits for a while, things started to improve as I grew in confidence to the point that I didn't need to rely on Viagra.

This friends with benefits thing ended since she moved out of town. Now it brings us to tonight. I met this girl on Tinder. She's funny, interesting and we have been out plenty of times clubbing and for brunch. Tonight things got a bit frisky and I didn't have any Viagra so I thought I'd just risk it hoping that I'd be fine. I was wrong. My thoughts were racing, I couldn't even get it up. And it just brought back memories from my first time.

I said I was tired and she seemed to be okay with it. So hopefully we can still continue this thing. Though I fucked it up big time, and I don't know what to do. This memory of tonight and my first time are racing around in my head.

I can't sleep.

I've noticed this doesn't only happen with sex, but also exams, study and presentations. My mind doesn't stay focused and it betrays me by bringing up stupid thoughts. Self conscious thoughts.

I booked in to have a mental health assessment tomorrow. I hope I can find an end to this as it is destroying my determination to become confident.

TLDR: Couldn't get it up my first time, couldn't get it up tonight, my thoughts are racing, they always do in pressured situations, I can't take it anymore. Its destroying my determination to become a better me.

57,"I think I'm addicted to you.  I haven't been able to figure out what it is exactly - whether it's the way you make me feel when I'm around you, or if it's a dopamine thing from constant contact through technology, or if it's some combination of the two.  Either way, I hate what it's doing to me. Yet, I absolutely love it too.  It's made me feel more alive than I have in my entire life.

I don't understand how you make me feel so simply incredible.  I didn't know I was able to feel emotions so powerful.  I am full of vigour when you're around; and so unashamedly free to be wholly myself and genuine.  When we became intimate, I was able to lose my inhibitions with you and simply enjoy having you with me like that.  I felt so safe.  Then one fateful night, you held me in your arms and played with my hair and began singing to me while we laid together.  It was such a peaceful and intimate and loving moment that you were effortlessly inside my shell and you filled a part of my soul I didn't even know existed.  I felt complete right then and there.  It was as if I had found my emotional haven.  It was hands down the greatest feeling anyone has ever given me.  I can only describe it as 'sanctuary'. 

Yet now I'm torn.  I'm upset because I'm not the person I was two months ago.  That person was focused, determined, fearless, goal-oriented, and lived a very healthy, busy, and active lifestyle.  He excelled, conquered his goals and actualised his potential.  He felt like the man he was supposed to be, the kind of person adults tell children they can be when they grow up.  That man had never been more happy in his entire life. 

Then you came along and I haven't been the same since.  I immediately started losing sleep, getting up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall back asleep for hours.  Then my diet began changing.  I made poorer choices and noticed my energy levels dropping, and that less energetic and tired person went to the gym less, and exercised less.  I became more attached to my phone, constantly seeking contact with you.  Sometimes even foregoing social plans and even evening classes so I could stay connected with you.  It felt even better somehow.

And you returned my attention it in spades.  It seemed like we were attached through our phones almost every night we didn't see each other.  We would talk for hours.  It was so often and sometimes for so long that we had at least 3500 messages back and forth in less than three weeks.  And that's a conservative estimate.  Not even 5000 would surprise me.  Just the first night chatting alone went way over my 500 text message memory limit.  I don't think I've sent so many messages to all my contacts combined over the last 3 years.

I got used to it.  They say it takes 21 days to form a habit.  And in those three short weeks of spending nights with you, both in person and cozied up to my phone, you became a constant in my life, and my favourite pass time.  It was really nice to have someone there for me.  Its been many long years since I wanted to share myself with someone and I've forgotten how nice it is.  Unlike the other rare times in my life I would share myself, this time I had no reservations.

And now, whenever I'm idle, even if it's just for thirty seconds, I want a bit of you.  Just a bit, just for a second, just so I have have my synapses flooded with dopamine and oxytocin.  Just so I can remind myself of what your touch was like.  I am compelled to seek it out.  My body is betraying me by becoming this way.  It's self destructive and self sabotaging and I've felt powerless to do anything about it.  It makes me feel like I've been needy and smothering and I hate that.  I have a lot of love to give, but I realise that this is a poor way to express that.  My logic is no longer ruling the day.  My heart is.  It makes me sad.

On the science hand, I'm sad because I'm not getting that rush of dopamine from my efforts to reach out and find reciprocation.  It's leaving that place now used to fulfilment so empty and I'm left with a dreadful, sinking feeling.  I know we only really had three weeks together followed by holiday vacations causing two weeks apart, but the hormonal after effects of those three weeks are not just lingering.  They're raging in their utmost splendour.

On the feelings hand, I'm sad because I feel addicted.  I feel unable to control my impulses and desires.  My feelings are still so fierce within me.  They make me feel *so* alive, for both better and worse.  I get to experience the gamut of feelings, and I love it and hate the experience equally.

By writing this I'm hoping I can bring to light what's been going on with me and gain some insight into how to control and harness these feelings to result in positive outcomes and experiences.  I just want to be with you, but not like this.  I want to be with you on the terms my brain *and* my heart want, not just my heart.  It's too fucking dumb and short sighted right now.  My physiology is betraying me.  How could my body do such a thing?

Maybe it's almost 2 months. Anyway, the stress of not having income sucks. I don't like stress (who does?).

Especially regarding your friends/roommate.

I was trying to ""make it"" so to speak as a freelancer but I've got a lot of debt, no savings, it wasn't going to happen. I'm not sure if ""I failed"" because I didn't make it. I made the most amount of money in my freelance attempt this last month or so but it still isn't enough. Even my ""meager"" living cost requirements of like $800.00+/mo where I'd have to make at minimum $30.00/day. I couldn't meet that freelancing.

I've got an interview tomorrow for a dishwashing job. I kind of in the back of my mind think ""Ah fuck me... I'm a ""Full stack developer"" why the fuck am I washing plates."" but I know why, I'm not that great yet, no car, and this is immediate. I need to start making money even if it's slow piss dripping out per hour. I also targeted this for high-turnover/fast immediate hire. Indeed between first applying yesterday and today, I've got an interview, 1 for 5.

I'll soon be  back to (hopefully) the mindset of ""Fuck me I hate my life, this job sucks"" but I'm also grateful you know, peace of mind. I can pay my bills. I'll give up a big chunk of my time. I might think too ""Oh well that just means I'll be more efficient at getting things done to make the most of my free time."" but perhaps work sucks and all I'll I want to do is find a brief escape (watching tv) and not do anything.

I am looking forward to the human interaction aspect though, I've been in my room for a long time haha, it seems these last two years I've just been in a box, I was unemployed for several months for a while. Just like ""Bills? What are those..."" That ultimately backfired and was dumb, destroyed my credit but whatever.

I learned a lot though regarding the web tech this last month, so I'll work on some side projects on my spare time. I don't think I will pursue freelancing because I don't know. I'm not against freelancing, I'm also not entirely fond of chasing jobs/contracts, and trying to ""please the client"" I'd rather build something for me. Maybe release the code, or create a Saas that makes money, I don't know.
