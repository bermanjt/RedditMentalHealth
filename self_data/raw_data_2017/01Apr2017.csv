3,"So, I don't think this is normal. But, I'm not sure. I also want to know if other people have these same thoughts. 

Basically, when I have no stimulation, my drifts into a DARK place. 

I think of different ways I could start self-harming (I've had REALLY strong urges in the past, but have never *really* acted on them). Or different eating disorders, how I could develop them/do them without anyone else noticing. 

I also will think about committing suicide. Like, how I could do it, what I would I put in the note, where, etc. 

And this happens EVERY TIME I'm allowed to have 100% alone time with only my mind, and no other stimulation. 

This is starting to happen even to the point where, even if there is stimulus, I will drift off into this area of my mind. 

And this isn't really mixed in with ""normal"" thoughts, like normal intrusive thoughts. They are ALL of my thoughts. 

I also have fantasies of people I love very much being abused/hurt/depressed/etc. and I ""save"" them in some way. Like, I make myself the hero. 

Is this in ANY scenario normal? ",01Apr2017,1

I personally don't like the term transabled, because it comes with the ""doing it for attention"" implication. I used it in the title because it's a more commonly known term.

7,"My Indian parents always call me a failure, saying how I'm not ""prestigious"" or ""successful"" like my ""friends."" They point out how other parents' kids are at top med schools, rich engineers, t14 law schools, investment bankers, consultants, etc. They said I'm ""failing"" at life because I'm not making six figures or more like my peers.

The thing is, no one can relate to me, because from a different perspective, I am quite ""successful. I went to UC Berkeley, majored in History, got a 3.7 GPA, and then worked in Oracle Corporation as an enterprise software sales representative, making around $65,000 a year.

However, that's not good enough. I only got a 2150 on my SAT, not a 2300. I got into Berkeley, but not Stanford or any Ivy League like the other Indian immigrant kids. I majored in History rather than a ""real"" subject like electrical engineering or computer science. I'm a ""mere salesman"" rather than a banker or consultant. they are saying i need to get a graduate degree (prestigious MBA or law degree) bc a bachelors isn't enough. They say bc the median Indian income is 90k, I'm a failure at 65k.

I don't know what to make. Do you agree with my parents that I'm a failure at life? They're both PhDs in Chemistry, and are ""ashamed of me"" :(",01Apr2017,7

11,"I just wake up with watery eyes and turned on my computer to share this with you because I think it's important; had this very short dream, or at least that's what I can remember.

I was alone at home, with my grandmother -like it used to be 8 years ago- she was cooking for me, and I was just going to take a shower because I had just finished cleaning a room, I think it was the warehouse -stuff we don't use anymore-

Anyways, when I was heading towards the bathroom I heard her humming a song, I didn't know which song was but it sounded familiar. Then I got stuck, I freezed, an immense fear ran through my body, but at the same time I felt so empty.

Afraid, I started walking towards my mom -I still call her like that...-, the food she was cooking smelled delicious but I just couldn't enjoy that feel. I asked her who am I, and she said ""How can you ask that? You're my little grandson, whom I have loved and raised since you were a baby. I felt relieved, because it's something she would say, she's a lovely grandmother.
Going to the bathroom again, I asked her out loud, how old am I, and she said 15.

I... my body, my heart, I could feel how I collapsed from the inside, I started crying and went to my room. I sat down on the floor and I was full of pain and sadness, I am 21 and she started forgetting me.

31,"It would make my life easier for me. If I was asexual or aromantic, I wouldn't care if I was going to be forever alone or I would never have sex. When I was a in elementary school, I didn't want dating or relationship ever. Well, I dreamed of getting married and having children in the future, but the ideas of romance grossed me out at that time. In elementary school, few of kids mocked me and called me ugly. The older girl on the school bus always teased me and called me ugly. She also told me I cannot get married because no one wants to marry an ugly girl like me. At that time, I didn't care and I believed that men would be mature eventually. In 8th grade, my former friend told me that I can't get a boyfriend or husband because I am ugly. I explained to her that men will mature and I would meet the right man who likes me for who I am. She claimed that she caught some guys talking about me and mentioning that I will never find love because I am ugly.

Anyway, when I was in elementary school, I didn't want a boyfriend at that time and I wasn't attracted to anyone. It was the best part of my childhood. When I was a preteen and young teen, I wasn't attracted to anyone and I did not want to think about thinking who is cute because I felt that there was no point for me to think about cute guys or talk to my friends about them since I was not pretty. I just imagine that a guy would be unhappy if he knew that I liked him, so I liked nobody. You wouldn't want an ugly person to like you, right? That would be a big disappointment, right? I did not want them to feel that way.

I am glad I was a late bloomer, so it worked out well for me in my case. I could enjoy few more last years of not attracting to anyone. Unfortunately, my hormones kicked in when I was 13-14 though I tried to repress my sexuality and romantic desires. It was easy to do that when I was a young teen. I was not a very sexual person. I started to like romance fictions and enjoy watching kiss scenes from movies, but I wasn't a hopeless romantic. I still tried to ignore sex as possible. I still found sex topics very uncomfortable. When I was in 8th grade and my classmate asked me if I want to have sex. I felt paranoid, and I answered NO! I think I also said wait until marriage. He was like, ""I mean in the future..Do you want to have sex someday, right?"" I think I avoided from answering, or I still answered no. It was awkward... I don't know why the hell he would ask me that question out of the blues. When I was 15-16, my desires for romance and sex increased. I became a hopeless romantic and a very sexual person. I still am. Also, sex topics aren't uncomfortable to talk about anymore. Actually, I enjoy talking about them. Also, I finally enjoyed sexual themes in fictions since I cannot repress my sexuality anymore. My hormones just persisted. Yes, they just want me to suffer... I also envy other people for having sex meanwhile I never have sexual experience with a partner yet. It is so frustrating... I hate when people took sex for granted. They should be SO HAPPY they got to experience sex. It is IMPOSSIBLE for me to have one because I am unattractive so no guy wants me.

However, I still did not talk to my friends about romance or guys so much...I tried to talk to VERY FEW friends about guys, but I'd not continue any further. I feel like it is a ""taboo"" for me to talk about guys because I feel like I do not deserve to have a boyfriend since I am not pretty enough. I just keep my crushes to myself. Whenever I was attracted to someone, it is supposed to be feeling good, right? For me, it got me down because I was in denial and I thought, ""NOOOOO! Why should I be attracted to someone again!? I cannot have him because I am not pretty enough and I am out of his league."" I also thought about how he would feel if he knew that I was attracted to him. If he did, in his mind he would be like, ""Blah, I wish an attractive woman was attracted to me instead. How disappointing.""

Oh, by the way, I wasn't bullied so much in middle school. I didn't get bullied at all in high school, and I had no social hardships in high school. At first, I was confused when people treated me like a normal person, but then I got used to it. I realized that I should be glad since I wasn't treated differently at all. I just had to work on my social skills, but they eventually got so much better when I was in college. I still get socially anxious around guys, especially ones I think they are cute. I would never compliment a guy especially on his looks because I feel like it is a taboo for me to compliment him. I do not want him to get offended. I just still get ""not pretty enough"" feelings. There were many times I thought of having cosmetic surgery, but I didn't want to for numerous reasons. I also never had major surgery (except mole removal and tooth pull out), so I am reluctant to surgery. I am not attractive, but I have many great bodily features and I do not take them for granted. I am glad to have them. For example, I look like 14-17 years old and I do not take my young looks for granted. I am skinny, and I do not take my weight for granted. I am happy to have what I have...except my face. It is so annoying when girls are like, ""OMGGGGG! I AM SO UGLY!!!"" They should be glad they do NOT have my condition. They took their faces for granted! Someone should slap their faces, please.

My face is not deformed though. My face just has a very minor asymmetrical feature....thanks to Goldenhar's syndrome. The rest of my face is fine. If you googled Goldenhar's Syndrome and see images, they are NOT what I look like. They are way worse. I am very close to normality. When I was born, my parents did not notice a minor difference on my face at first until the doctor pointed out when I opened my mouth. My jaw did not open straight but to right side slightly due to short jaw on right side. I never have any treatment for my condition or I never get any surgery. I am a healthy Goldenhar's Syndrome patient, and I do everything normal people do. Also, I hate when someone takes a picture of me so my asymmetry becomes more visible than it actually is. In person, it looks more symmetrical, but it is still a little visible. I became good at taking pictures of myself so I could look more symmetrical.

Anyway, my condition was never in my way of making new friends or finding a job, but I feel like it makes my dating life or sex life impossible. I know many unattractive people, such as obese people, got dates and married...and even have sex. It makes me wondering if they could get a partner, it means I am the ugliest person in the world. Even if I wear nice clothes... Even if I am skinny. Even if I have lovely hair... Nobody cares about it if I am not attractive. If I was an obese woman with a normal face, it would be a different story. Someone told me maybe they are not picky, so he implied that I am picky about a partner. It may be partially true, and I try to be open-minded with different people and give them chances if I can. Nobody asked me out, so it never happened.

Well, I am not an emotional person or dwelling on my looks too much. When I am being busy, I just ""forget"" and I become confident. I was living my life...until I see a guy and thought of trying to talk to him so I suddenly got negative thoughts triggered in my mind. They told me that I am not pretty enough and that I would get rejected. They told me not to bother him otherwise he would be disappointed if he got approached by an unattractive girl like me. So I gave up and moved on. I didn't realize what several kids said to me and how they treated me in elementary school affected my mind later in my life so my mind is already fucked up. I'd believe that I am ""ugly"" for the rest of my life even if I know I am not ugly. Well, I am also not pretty out there. Even if my mind had been clear or I've been happy, negative thoughts would still run through my mind when I became attracted to a guy. My mind cannot be fixed. I wouldn't pursue a guy ever, so I just wait for him to pursue or make a move. Well, I was always not sure if a guy did flirt with me or he was super friendly with me so I chose to think that he was just friendly and enjoying my sense of humor or company. That was it. Few times, I got told that someone likes me, so I didn't know how to respond. I just laughed a little bit and said I am not falling for it. I thought that it was a joke, so they had to insist that it was true. I still doubted, so I said it is might a misunderstanding. Even if I suspected that a guy may be interested in me, I told myself not to get wrong ideas and it was just a wishy thought. Perhaps, I am right. I feel like guys were never attracted to me otherwise they would have pursued me. I prefer a guy to pursue me persistently since I wouldn't want to bother him or disappoint him if an unattractive woman like me is interested in him.

If I ever got a boyfriend, I would be concerned about what his family and friends would think of me. I wouldn't want him to suffer or get stressed because of me if they disapproved me as his girlfriend. I don't want to ruin any guy's life, so it is why I wish I was asexual and aromantic. It would be easier for my life, so I may never have depression and no guy would have to worry about dating me if they may possibly face disapproval from his family or friends.

By the way, I am not going to sign up for online dating site because I am afraid they would be disappointed if we met up. I mean I wouldn't post a worst picture of me as my profile picture, so it wouldn't work. Please do not tell me that I will meet the right person someday. It doesn't help because I know there is no way we can predict the future. I also hate when few stranger women called me beautiful because I feel like it is a bullshit. It is why I am sensitive to complimenting people and considering their feelings, so I wouldn't call them beautiful. They will know that it is a bullshit, and they would doubt you. Why can't you use another term which is true about them? If they got all straight A's in school, you can call them smart because that is true. If they have great sense in fashion, you can tell them that you love their clothes because it is true. Just stop calling them beautiful when they are not. It gets annoyed when women call me beautiful because I know it is bullshit. I am glad nobody bothered calling me beautiful anymore when they do not mean it. If they have known me for a while, it is okay if they call me beautiful because they see my personality through. I can tell that it is genuine. It happened to me before, too. Sometimes, I think that the person is plain-looking and I got to know them. Strangely, I thought they are looking good though they still look the same. It is like, their personality shined. If a stranger called me beautiful without getting to know me, that is bullshit! It is why I am careful about complimenting people in general so I am not a very complimenting person. I will compliment when I know it is safe and true.

Ah, I didn't expect that I would end up writing so long. Oh, well! I guess I wanted to vent out. I wish that I was asexual and aromantic, but at the same time, I do not want to lose my sexuality even if it is pointless since I never got a boyfriend. If I was asexual and aromantic, my life would be a lot easier. I'd be like, ""I do not have to worry about being pretty enough because I don't plan on having a relationship or sex so who cares?"" That would be great... I wouldn't have to deal with my inner voices when I am attracted to a guy. I would NEVER be attracted to anyone!",01Apr2017,4

40,"Im in college and I had a group of friends for months that I thought I treated very well. I accidentally hurt one of the people in the group trying to defend myself and then talking it out with them. It turned into something worse later on and I was the last to know so I apologized to everyone about it, gave them space, and owned up to my mistake when I found out. Because of it, I was essentially kicked out of the group but I was never given an apology for what was done to me. Two people said they were still there for me but havent really talked to me. 

Another was a girl I was seeing for a month, who kept going back and forth with me and I thought I did my best to be mature throughout all of it by talking to her and letting her be open if we ever had any issues. She never spoke up and always said we were fine but after this situation she said she had enough and said we will never be friends. She doesnt hate me though but we are not even friends at this point, we never were, and we will never be. I thought that is what she wanted, we talked about it many times but it seems there were other issues that I never knew about. She always threw an issue at my face that I tried talking to her about but she would just shut down anything I said and then come back and throw it my face another day. I couldnt even mention a girls name without being yelled at and asked who it was and yet we were never exclusive because she was never ready and I was never seeing anyone else when we were dating. 

I keep thinking back at my mistakes, maybe I was too available, or maybe I wasnt good enough, but why would she keep going back and forth with me if we werent compatible and if I was such a bad person? Why would she come back a month after the last time she ended it and say she may want to try again in the future? Why would she continue to talk to me daily after she said that isnt what she meant? Why does she hate my other friends, that are girls, that I talk to if we arent even friends now? Why would she hold everything in and say we were perfectly fine every time I asked her to tell me if we had any issues and then she says this was the last straw? Why would she pretend to be ok with being around me right before this situation happened and then tell me its pretty much over for us ever being friends?

The last person, who this whole situation happened to, told me they werent comfortable with me. But we would still be able to talk, we just cant hang out or be as close as we were before. We would just be classmates, like the other people we would casually talk to from time to time at school. They said Im not a bad person and they dont hate me but I just cant be around them anymore. They also said if I need help because Ive been distant and quiet lately, that I should get help. Ive been like that because the girl I dated kept treating me like I didnt belong and would ignore me even though I was trying my best to be her friend like everyone told me to and like how she said she wanted. Ive never told them to get help for any issues they had, and I was always open to talking if they needed it. No one ever defended me with how the girl I was dating was treating me and kept going back and forth. They just said that she may have her reasons and that I should be there for her as a friend no matter what happens. I keep thinking back at what else I may have done to deserve this but I cant think of anything. Maybe Im just so dense that I actually do deserve this.

The girl I dated and the guy in the group are really close now. She treats him the way she used to treat me when she first met me and tried getting my attention. He randomly told me they are just friends and that he would never date a friends ex, or someone a friend dated, yet it looks like that is probably going to happen or it already has. I never mentioned how I felt about it to anyone but its not easy seeing that. I dont know why he ever mentioned that but I cant handle it. 

None of them have talked to me since, except for the guy who said he was still there for me and it was just school related where we had to talk. Im stuck seeing them in my classes, I have to work with them on certain assignments, but I havent said a word to them either. Maybe I am the issue, maybe I deserve being kicked out, maybe I wasnt easy to date and I messed up everything so it didnt work out, I just dont know what to do about it. I just go to my classes and then go do my own thing. I see them on social media and I want to remove them, my counselor said its ok to do so after all of that. She says its not right the way they treated me and always overlooked my feelings in many situations. But maybe I am wrong and I will create issues for myself by deleting them? I dont know what to do and its so hard to focus with everything.

Tldr; I thought I was a good friend to my friends of 6ish months, I put up with being thrown back and forth with a girl I was dating and I tried being mature throughout it all and tried to be her friend like she wanted, accidentally hurt another friend trying to defend myself, I owned up to my mistake and apologized for it all, nobody defended me but was told Im not a bad person, told I need help, but was kicked out of our group because of this and became an acquaintance instead. Now Im alone, the ones that said they were ok with me havent talked to me, the girl I dated said this was the last straw and we will never be friends, and Im stuck seeing all of them in my classes.

41,"Yesterday evening I embarked on something I have been wanting to do for over a decade; participate in a game of Dungeons and Dragons. Growing up I was mostly a jock through High School, but I have a geeky side that I really needed to let out. I researched a little bit into D&amp;D but knew I needed to be surrounded by others who could help me out. 

A few weeks ago my girlfriend and I met a lovely couple who we learned were interested in forming a D&amp;D group. This couple was very knowledgeable and had been playing practically since the games creation. My girlfriend has played a couple games in the past but they only lasted short sessions because of terrible Dungeon Masters and uninterested players. It was exciting for both of us to be invited into their home and play with five other people. 

Everyone was kind, helpful and guided me every step of the way. They walked me through the basics of the game, character creation, imagery and every little detail to make the game fun and exciting. The Dungeon Master was amazing and kept everyone engaged. The night was filled with laughter, teamwork and adventure! We shared amazing food, mead and great company. I can honestly say that I have never been so excited to hang out with friends from 6PM to 2AM and then go to work at 6AM! lol 

We've already planned our next night to meet again and continue on our adventure. This game is absolutely amazing, I don't even care if people pick on me. It's fun, screw the haters!

**EDIT:** If you're unaware, munchausens is a mental illness where people fake having a disease.



I have an illness myself. I got diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis in my mid-twenties (a mild variant affecting my lungs) a few years ago. Since then I've had some other things go wrong with me which has pretty much caused me to develop hypochondria. I dont have a family as they dont want anything to do with me since I left their religion several years ago. I've been dealing with a lot of my issues by myself with some help from my bf. But he isn't so great with the emotional side of talking, and my trust issues haven't helped either.

Since the diagnosis, I was becoming more depressed and distant every year. I didn't even realise it was happening. I didn't know how to talk about my illness because I dont want to come across as attention seeking, but it was eating me up. Whenever I try to talk about a problem, people always seem to bring up how great other aspects of my life are and then I immediately feel guilty and stop. I dont like bringing people down either as I'm too sensitive to their emotions, so I put on a brave face and pretend I'm ok. 

I met this friend (I'll call him Tim) over a year ago at a new years eve party at his house, hosted by his brother (Steve). I knew from his brother that he had a tumour and couldn't work. He looked an absolute mess, messy hair and dressed in 'comfort clothes'. You know the type you wear when you stay at home for the weekend without showering? Obviously didnt care about the party but at the same time wanted company. He seemed really nice and I could talk to him really easily. He has no family besides his brother either, and his brother is a bit odd. Seems mentally challenged, with limited emotional capacity. It was pretty obvious that Tim didn't have anyone to talk to about his illness. I thought maybe I could eventually talk to him if I could build his trust.

My bf was friends with his brother so I could still see Tim through meetups with his brother. So over the next few months I tried to get close to him and help him understand that I'd like for us to be friends. At first he'd only come to our house with his brother. We all shared the same taste in music too so we went to gigs together too. Eventually, after an invite from my bf he agreed to come to our place on his own. That was a major breakthrough! He finally trusted me enough to feel comfortable. I know he has major anxiety, and seems to have a lot of the symptoms of avoidant personality disorder. Think I have abandonment issues myself as I've been clinging on to him every time he tried to keep me at a distance. 

The first few times he used to come over, he would need a lot of alcohol to feel comfortable. It got less and less each time. These days we barely touch the stuff. Feels like another breakthrough with him.

We've become really close. We've shared a lot of stories together about our past, issues with our parents and such. Talked about our diseases. I eventually came out about mine after a few months of knowing him and slowly started talking about it. Talked about my fears, shared a lot of tears. He helped me manage my anxiety the first time I coughed up pure blood. He's also helped me come to terms with the illness and given me space to talk about my family issues. His own family history is awful too. We've called each other family, and he has been there for me in ways my own parents never have. He knows how to make me laugh and cheer me up. I always enjoy our time together. I am an incredibly anxious person who has difficulty showing certain emotions but he's made me open up completely. 

But his own illness is another story and a very strange one. There's no obvious signs that he is ill. Doesn't seem underweight, he complains about pains and hallucinations mostly. He isn't seeing a normal NHS doctor, apparently he's signed up for 'experimental medication' that is keeping him alive. When he first got diagnosed 6 years ago, his ex-girlfriends dad knew a good friend who works on tumours. Tim was with the NHS at first, but the chemo didn't work and he agreed to take the experimental stuff. However it meant wiping off the fact that he even has a tumour off his records so he cant prove it. He says these meds arent legal, he's not allowed to talk about it but yet seems to happen in the same hospital I go to. 

The meds arent free either. His brother pays for them, and apparently his ex-girlfriends dad (who is super-rich and currently travelling indefinitely) sometimes pays for them too. And his doctor who cares way too much about his patients sometimes pays too. There's a dramatic story every month from him too somehow. He seems to have a very interesting medical life.

I believed for a long time because his brother told us first, I didnt think to doubt it. He lives with his brother, and barely has any money and has a very limited amount of possessions. I just couldn't imagine that someone could choose to live this way. He doesn't seem that stupid. He's normally very nice to me, but theres been a few occasions where he's turned into a jerk. I nearly cut ties with him at one point because he just became a jerk fulltime, he was suicidal and depressed. It felt like he had a complete mental breakdown at that point. I kept making excuses (I was very co-dependant for a while). But eventually I'd had enough and stopped talking to him. Then he apologised profusely, blamed it on his tumour messing his head up and went back to being nice. He explained to me how much he really cares about me, asked if I still consider him family and I told him yes. I know I'm too soft but I really do care about him. He feels ashamed to call me family. He's been on good behaviour since, although I've broken my co-dependency and doing my best to stay mentally healthy. No more excuses.

We went on holiday together with his brother last year for a week. He said his doctor gave him some meds that would let him be ok for a week. He was absolutely fine the whole time. My bf didn't think to question it, neither did his brother so I went along with it too. Whenever he visits me, he says he's been given meds to help him be ok. 

I've been talking to another friend about him a lot. I know I'm very naive, I've never understood liars and dont pick up on it too well. My friend alerted me to the fact that he is potentially lying. So recently, I thought maybe I'll try getting some details about this apparent tumour. I got as far as finding out its a grade 4 glioma (used to be grade 3). Then he accused me of thinking he is lying so I left it at that. He also had a ministroke recently, when I met up with him a week after the fact he seemed okish, just a bit quiet. He said he had to drink several cups of coffee to function. I know he had to walk into town to meet me and thats over an hour from his place, this doesn't seem possible? It's been about 3 weeks now and he's absolutely fine now. And I know a grade 4 is freaking serious! 



I know his story is ridiculous. I just desperately wanted to believe because he has been very nice to me and easy to talk to. I spent so much time worrying he was dying that I never really thought to question it all. I know he was messed up from the moment I met him and I'm ok with that. It's not like I dont have plenty of my own issues. I really want to help him. I feel like he cares about me, but when he lies so much it sometimes feels like even that is a lie.

I dont know what to think. I want to confront him. I've been reading a lot about compulsive lying and Munchausens. It seems difficult, if not impossible to treat.

There was a time last year where his mood really improved and he was trying to get a job. I dont know why he stopped, he blamed it on his illness getting worse but maybe there's a different reason. He's also told me before that he wishes he could give me a normal life, I thought he was apologising for his tumour but maybe its something else. He's told me that I'm the only real friend he has ever had and trusted. He hates what his issues are doing to me, but carries on talking to me about them.

He has really low self-esteem and I keep trying to help build it up. Maybe I'm just giving him everything he craves. I dont care if he is lying, he's helped me and I want to help back. I wish he'd be honest. I love him like a brother. He is soo sweet but so anxious and worrying all the time. I think its eating him up.

I dont know what I got myself into. I feel like I'm the crazy one.

**TLDR:** My friend is faking a tumour, his experimental meds story doesnt make any sense. I want to confront him and get him proper help, but I'm scared of losing him. I care about him too much and I know he cares back.",01Apr2017,1

I like to think of myself as a good guy, I try to be one every day but I'm sure the biggest douchebags ever think of themselves as great people so that's not a good indicator.   


I know it's perfectly possible to be all of those things and still get rejected, there doesn't have to be a specific reason but it's such a *consistent* trend I feel like it has to be something I'm not aware of.     

Maybe I'm actually a douchebag and they're just too nice to tell me. Maybe I'm too stupid to realize I am, maybe I am just ugly. Anxiety over constantly asking myself whether I'm being the first 2 has started killing me every time I'm in a social situation which I'm sure doesn't help.
