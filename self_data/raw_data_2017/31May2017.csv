1,"Things are amazing. We've practically been living together for a year and dating for three. We've always lived with her friends and for the most part had a full house. We recently just got our own place and was concerned about how much I missed her old roommate who is a girl. My immediate thought was ""fuck. I don't need these kind of thoughts."" But I realized that I don't miss her friend that way, but I miss having a house full of people. Our new place leaves me feeling so empty and lonely. I've talked to the gf about all of this and she was very understanding. I just needed to get this off my chest some more. 

TL;DR: Not used to living with just one person and it's bothering me. I know I'll be fine though.

2,"My dream job apparently is very bad at following up. Was supposed to have a 2nd interview this week scheduled last week, but never got a call. Followed up, but can't seem to reach my interviewer.

I called today and got transferred to sales and they said to follow up through email. I did but still no response.

3,"I have an estranged relationship with my dad's side of the family and my brother has come around to viewing it as my dad's fault. He is currently ""drinking himself to a .24 BAC every night"" to deal with stuff. A familiar place for me. I get to relate and talk him through this period I am very familiar with. Our dad made us feel belittled and failures and not worth existing. I came out the other side wiser and stronger. I know he will too. I'm just very thankful he's reaching out to me even after the multitude of bad PR our dad was put on me. I won't go into details about the abuse but it drove me suicidal. He is 8n that period now and I get to try to talk to him instead of sayomg goodbye. Equally scared and joyful for this opportunity.",31May2017,1
4,"And it's so frustrating. She was clearly not ready mentally to be in a long term committed relationship. I doubt she even thinks of me like that. She needed my attention, that's all she wanted. And then her interest went elsewhere. I feel stupid for investing so much, so fast, for so little.

All of my support system delicately and maturely tried to guide me away while it wasn't too late. I didn't listen and we went back and forth for a few months longer than we should have. I had been pining for her for years, and I didn't want to give that up easily.

Of course I tried to forgive cheating, and narcissism, and broken promises, and her selfish behavior. I'm not faultless, but I certainly gave everything I could, and she got scared when the feelings got deep.

I'm just so frustrated, sad, angry, hurt, and disappointed. It's been a few months since we officially broke up, and 2-3 since we stopped talking completely. I can't seem to sort out my thoughts and feelings. I feel emotionally healthy, not despondent and depressed, but mentally I feel more mixed than I ever have and I don't know how to cope. God I miss her, but I know we will never ever work out now, and I just never want to hear from her again. I keep expecting her to send an email or something, keep receiving nothing.

10,"Saturday I found a stray puppy by chance. took her home, fed her, all that stuff. was planning to call animal control on Monday and take her to a shelter. posted on facebook in a local lost and found page to see if anyone was missing her. I do this pretty often.

sunday i wake up to my computer being fried by a storm. i had it plugged into a surge protector. Wasn't enough. I'm out about 300 dollars. I also won't have a computer for about a month. This is going to sound kinda sad, but my computer is basically my only coping mechanism. that's worth mentioning. it's not much, but being able to tune out and watch a twitch stream helps me deal with stress.

Monday it was still storming. no internet, no power. verizon is fucking cancer and the person who decided data caps was an acceptable buisness model needs to be shot, by the way. Also it's momorial day so the animal control isn't open. whatever. i pass the day doing busy work and playing shitty phone games in airplane mode. Eventually my phone dies so I'm just sitting and drinking. 

Monday night my dad was stressed out. he and my mom have been fighting. I stay here to kinda help out and so i can take it easy on work while i deal with my legs. it doesn't really bother me when they fight because I'm an adult and it's not like it happens often, but they were both also going through DT's for thier pain medicine. Also, the pup has been sitting outside the door fussing all night. It was pissing down rain, but our porch is nice and dry so she just wanted to come in. it sounds mean, but we live in a place that's prime to dump dogs so we find a half starved, abandoned dog like 4 times a year. We don't like getting attached before sending them off to whoever wants them or humane society. We also didn't have enough flea meds for her and getting fleas out of a house is an ordeal. 

Anyway, my dad snaps from the noise and goes outside and shoots the dog. instantly regretted it, burst out crying. I did too when i heard the shot. We've never put down a healthy dog before, much less a puppy. I'm tearing up just typing this. Normally I'd watch youtube or something when I'm that fucked up about something but not an option. It was about 11pm so i just had to sit in the dark and stew about what happened. 

Couldn't sleep, obviously, Cranked the car, sat in the driveway and watched youtube on my phone using the car charger. went over my data cap in an hour because Verizon are human fucking trash. whatever. 

So i wake up this morning, remember the facebook post and go to delete it. Nope, someone commented at 5 in the morning today saying that;s thier dog. I had to tell them it got hit by a car and we put it down. Told them I'm so sorry and they thanked me for feeding her. 

I can't handle thinking about that fucking dog. My parents are both acting like nothing happened and i just can't get out of bed. I called in sick. 

it's my fucking fault for taking the dog up here. I should have just left it on the road. someone else would have dealt with it and that dog would be home by now. Jesus fucking Christ, man",31May2017,9
11,"Today was the very first time seeing the ocean. Living in a crapy river town my sound fun but there's nothing special about muddy river water. I went on vacation with my boyfriend's family to Hilton Head South Carolina. After staying the night at a hotel we decided to go to the beach. When I finally got close enough to catch a glimpse, I was amazed by how there is no land in sight. After the long walk there I ran straight in ocean. I felt like someone making love for the first time as I take my first steps into the ocean. I swam with my boyfriend and his sisters until eleven. We went back to our room to pack up and move to a vacation home they found us. After packing we ate at Poppies, we tried to go back to the beach but there was literally no where to park. Every time a space was available, someone took it like the last cookie in the jar. His stepdad decided to drive to another beach. The second beach was smaller than the last and there was hardly as many people like the last beach. His little sister didn't spray sunscreen on me as much as I needed. I had to wear my boyfriend's Tshirt because my shoulders were burning. I tucked my shirt under my bikini so I could get a good belly tan, (big mistake). We built sand empires using the to go cups from Poppies. When we went swimming his sister stepped thought she stepped on a shell, when she picked it up she found a live hermit crab. We went back to the shore and played with the crab for about twenty minutes before throwing it back. My boyfriend and I swam to the far parts of the beach where there weren't very many people, and we made out the whole time. We came back to hangout with his sisters until it was time to leave. As soon as we checked in our vacation home, I started to burn. I burned everywhere but my stomach, but the next day most of it healed. Now my back hurts so bad I can hardly stand moving. I hate having fair skin. 

Update: On Friday I started pealing. I haven't pealed in four years even though I burn easily. I let his little sister peal my skin off in big chunks and we would show her dad. I have first degree burns and now most of my back is pealed off. At least I'm tan now.

14,"If anyone has questions or whatever I just need to talk to people who aren't ""professionals"" or friends/family with agendas.

For those who aren't aware, bipolar is when you have severe bouts of depression and extreme almost superhuman highs, where when it's happening you think you are a God.  Obviously you're still mortal but the high is so intense you just aren't as aware of limitations.  Ie. You still need sleep but you can go days without it and not even notice, it all seems like one day to you (when I was younger this could go on for a couple weeks before I would collapse).  You can exercise far harder because all you feel is the pleasure, then after the high is over all you feel is stress fractures or even dislocations you weren't aware of.  Same goes for food, forget to eat and can keep going like an Energizer bunny anyway.  Sex well holy heck I'm going to get into that here shortly.

When the Sun finally starts coming out regularly with clear skies and warm weather, I always get a guaranteed longterm (more than a week) manic phase.  I think a lot of people get better moods when the Sun first comes out like this again (think it's obvious considering all the people that get glued to being outdoors) but being bipolar takes it to another level.

I should also note here that I'm on disability because of this and I also have assisted-living.  The shorthand of this is I don't have a lot of disposable income (obvious I'd think), but most of my time each year is like a permanent summer vacation during elementary.  No one will give you a job, you don't have a lot at your disposal, so you just have a ridiculous amount of free time.

So... uhhh... where I live the age of consent is 16.

I have had sex with more 16 - 18 year olds since I got on disability and assisted-living than I ever did when I was in High School.  Why?  Because of the mania.  When it happens, I get women my age and older.  I think this demographic knows something is up, but they know they sex is going to be intense (as men know with women who have mental health issues), so they encourage it and milk their heightened orgasms for as long as they can keep me around for.

The younger ones though they think it's all real and nothing is wrong.  Which is what I think as well during these phases.  I'm not hanging out at high schools or anything.  Just my abundance of time in public having no money, so loitering like a teenager in general spaces and getting teenage female attention... because of my bipolar, and all that energy you get when manic, I am in pretty wicked shape for my age.  I look better than a lot of teenagers.  So a horny 16 - 18 year old girl... see what I mean?

I only had sex with four different 16 - 18 year olds when that was ""age appropriate"".  Now that I'm well beyond that... well.  This year, I've already had 7.  The weird thing is for all other purposes they should know better.  Once the mania ends and I'm done tearing through women, or being used by women who know I'm easily taken advantage of but smoking hot + high energy + basically on call penis, when I reflect on it I never get it.  They talk about doing well in school.  They're always good looking and their boy problems are just because they find boys too immature.  Which I remember girls complaining to me about when I was that age.  So it isn't like they're unintelligent or don't have other options.  Maybe they're using me too.  I don't know.

All I know is every time I'm not manic, I want it to stop.  I seek treatment and do everything I can.  Early on I could selfadmit to psych treatment during mania, but now they don't take me.  Like I'm so old they don't care, or they're bored and want to see what I'll do this time.  I have spoken to psychs during manic episodes where teenage sex is being thrown at me, women are using me, I'm going into debt buying things I'll be returning later, etc., and they just tell me to enjoy the moment for once.

They know something's up and they want me to fester to create more social problems for them to solve.  These people are likely at least as sick as me, just in a different way.

The latest lay and this is what I don't understand.  I just go out when I'm like this and start getting laid.  It happens so fast I don't even know what starts it.  The latest one I went to the mall and I got lunch and sat down at a table next to what I knew was a younger girl.  She kept looking and I couldn't tell if it was nervousness (I dress like a man**** during this phase, I throw out these clothes when it's over to stop it happening again but when it happens again I just buy the same kind of clothes) or attraction.  I said something out loud about my food to no one, she responded to me and that's all I remember for conversation.  Next thing I can recall is making sure she was at least 16 (I always ask for IDs like I'm police which I think scares them but they rarely leave) and then doing the makeout/pet thing before she's asking if I have a condom.

The one prior to this was a woman younger than me but more than old enough to know something was ""off"" (mid30s likely) due to my behavior and midday.  I was sitting at the park and she sat next to me and I complimented her sandals.  Then she started complimenting me and wouldn't stop.  I ended up getting oral sex from her in the park, then we went to my vehicle and I parked it in a quiet area (I know a lot, again all this time I have) and had intercourse (protected) with her multiple times over a couple hours.

When I'm not manic I can't talk to women for the life of me.  When I'm manic I pull them in, being aware of what I'm doing as in I'm watching it, but otherwise feeling like I'm on autopilot.

I'm just now coming down from a twoweek long manic episode (during which I sought admission to a hospital multiple times and was refused, and saw my psych twice and he kept downplaying it - I get a new psych every year and this is par for the course now) and the lack of sleep, nutrition, and almost endless exercise and heavy sexual activity is finally aware to me.  All at once.  I do still get tested after every partner but I almost forgot a couple times during this episode.  I'm pretty sure I will one time.  I'm only getting older.  Shit's getting worse.

I'm very sore and very tired and it's very obvious psychiatrists and the medical system in general want to keep people like me sick and around to cause more drama in the world.

I also know the mania is over because women aren't responding like my first three words are the perfect key for their lock anymore.  I'm stumbling and everything's feeling forced.  Like I said it's basically a superpower.  I may get a second wind soon which is terrifying as well.  I just want life to be over.  There is so much pain behind this and I can't stop or be helped.

Ask or say anything I just need to communicate with other sorts of people.",31May2017,1
15,"Since college applications started I had trouble with my financial aid and it took me so long to get a stupid little error fixed, my counselor in highschool couldn't even help. 

After that I had trouble signing up for my university's orientation, I ended up missing the deadline because of that error despite emailing the people for help. I will most likely be rescinded because of that. 


I ended it with my girlfriend last Friday. Exactly a year after I first hung out with her in the yearly art exhibit at school. Although I still loved her I had to end it because of something called the hedgehog's dilemma

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog%27s_dilemma?wprov=sfla1

And incompatibility. 


Now all of the sudden I found out a guy had been trying to get to know her for a while now and my jealously has been through the roof. I had been told by mutual friends how they had been spending time together after school and I found out so late. My friend even told me how he has a restraining order for sexual harassment but I can't possibly know if its true.

Now, I came home today jealous and sad. Only to find that the cat I loved and slept with had been run over by a car while I was at school. It feels as if everything good in my life is being stripped away from me. There's lots of other things I can't mention now about my life but this month has definitely brought me to my lowest point.

24,"So I guess that I've had kind of a messed up childhood.  My parents were never together.  My mom occasionally held low level part time university teaching positions but has achieved most of her wealth through her marriage to and divorce from my brother's[19m] father who she has been at war with for as long as I can remember.

Her interests are now what could be called new age spiritualism.  She owns two very nice homes both furnished one of which she rents out and pursues spiritual retreats and connected social events.  She is income poor but lives very very comfortably with her assets.

My father has always been kind of a stupid opinionated drunk.  He wasn't quite abusive.  He never hit me but typically he likes to mess with people and lecture them and enter rooms and start talking about how he noticed the rug wasn't quite centered and why is that and you need to be more careful and if you don't learn to keep the rug centered how will you ever do anything else and it was pretty much always like when he was drunk which is always.  He's a beer drinker.  Typically, he would spend several hours at the bar after work.  I would go with him when I was younger but as I got older he would usually just pick me up, drunk, after being at the bar.  He used to be a carpenter who made decent money but lived paycheck to paycheck and is now a cab driver with no bank account.

My living situation was very unusual.  My mom's was the closest thing I had to a stable home in the sense that I felt comfortable there and I had a room with my things in it.  I stayed at my moms house Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday nights and spent the rest of the time at my dads. When I was 7 my mom married my brothers dad and from then until I was 12 we lived on an estate about two miles outside of town.  After that she moved to a very nice house on the edge of town.

My dad lived in various one bedroom apartments with the typical setup being PBR, summer sausage, and cheap cheddar cheese in the fridge, an unmade mattress on the floor and a TV somewhere in the room.  Then he moved into a dilapidated rental house with some rattlesnake woman who had a teenage daughter but felt that her daughter was ""better off"" in foster care and so she would only occasionally be there for visits.  Once the daughter let me touch her pussy.  I was terrified of the girlfriend.  She was extremely verbally abusive.  Later I heard that she had made accusations of sexual contact between my dad and her daughter which I find plausible knowing the situation and the people involved.  When I was about 10 he moved into a house owned by a woman who he knew from the bar.  She was a drunk and a mess but was in no way abusive other than in the ways that constantly drunk people always are.  In this living situation there was no marriage and my father had no equity in any of the bills he was paying.  At this point also I was now very physically isolated about 40 minutes from my mom.  I would have to take this commute to school on Monday and thursday mornings.  I had a room but it was kind of half storage and so was not home to me.  The things being stored were there the entire time I was in the room.

If you saw my parents together you would see my mom as a person to suck up to and make conversation with and if you saw my dad you would think he was trash and if he said hi to you you wouldn't like it.

I rarely got to hang out with other kids.  I was constantly commuting or out of town or parents who approved of me through my mom often very much disapproved of me through my dad and of course I had no idea about any of this at the time.  I read and ate organic food at my moms and I played video games and watched dish tv and often are hamburgers(no bun or condiments) and minute rice at my dads.

My appearance was very sloppy.  My mom refused to spend money on haircuts or clothes or shoes and would demand that I ask my dad who would say no it's your mom's responsibility etc etc.  sometimes my hair would get to a point where my dad would force me to just cut my bangs myself and that was really embarrassing.  I grew up in an affluent place and my mother was very stylish in everything.  I remember our dining room table costing $10,000.  I heave never had a long term best friend.

I rarely saw my brothers dad but I do remember him and my mother screaming at the tops of their lungs at each other, and I remember the violently bitter divorce that defined both of their lives into my twenties.  My mother felt cheated she got a large lump sum but a very small monthly payment and my brother was supposed to spend every other weekend at my dads.

I'm going to pause because this is getting really long but it would be really great to hear people's thoughts and opinions.  Feel free to ask anything.  I just can't take this to the present day right now but I will say that both of my parents have stolen large sums of money from me since I turned 18 and that they absolutely refuse to acknowledge any of this as being at all accurate.  Neither one has ever once apologized to me for anything

29,"The dewy-eyed, guilt-driven liberal courting of Muslim communities, with double kid gloves on, is the greatest gift liberals could’ve ever given to the far right. 

It’s alienating tons of people who're having justified concerns and worries about Islam and Muslim communities, and ultimately drives them into the hands of the far right where their concerns are not only not being rejected but furthermore used as a fertilizer for all kinds of racist, nihilist, cynical nonsense that the far right is known for. 

It is one of current-gen liberals' greatest failures to have succumbed to that knee-jerk reflex of always chanting the exact opposite of whatever comes from the right -- regardless of how much that opposite might be at full odds with liberals' very own worldview! 

Liberals ***sorely*** need to remind themselves -- as I have -- that protecting minorities, including religious minorities, is **not the only tenet of liberalism.** 

**Egalitarianism** is another. I.e., liberals must start to treat Muslim minorities with THE SAME skepticism and scrutiny that they have been treating Christian majorities with. **That** would be truly egalitarian. It doesn't matter if it's a minority or a majority: all nutjobs are the same! 

Again: Protecting minorities is not the only tenet of liberalism. 

**Laicism** is another. I.e.: pushing back religion -- ALL religion, and theist religion in particular -- with an iron fist to the point that it becomes mere folklore that manifests in superficial customs &amp; rituals that don't hurt anybody. (Which fortunately is what has happened with Christianity through most of the Western world... and it's also where Islam is lagging a good 500 years behind right now.) 

For example, liberals need to question wearing Hijabs with (at least) the same vigor that they've been questioning references to ""God"" throughout governmental procedures or using ""Merry Christmas"" as the default holiday greeting with. They have to oppose parallel societies that practice or push for a de-facto Sharia lifestyle with the same vigor they've been opposing creationism or abstinence-only sex ed. with -- instead of ogling at those things as some kind of ""cultural enrichment"". 

TL;DR  
The choice is simple, fellow liberals: you gotta sort out and understand what truly makes a liberal a liberal... that being liberal ***includes*** being able to take off the kid gloves and use those iron fists, sometimes even against minorities... *OR* keep alienating and sending people into the hands of those on the other end of the political spectrum who'll gladly accept them and re-educate them with their poisonous ideology.

It's approaching midnight and I have so much homework and studying to do and school tomorrow, but I don't think I'm going to do it. I've had depression since middle school and attempted to get by with occasional meetings with the school counselor and stuff. In high school, I built some resiliency, got a counselor, and was getting better until for some reason, I hit a huge slump and lost motivation to do anything. I hadn't felt like that in a while and my parents, who generally shun and hate my depression for making me ""abnormal"" eventually snapped last night. They raised me to be a high functioning member of society with a high-paying job and conditioned me to be an overachieving perfectionist (they're stereotypical asian parents) so when my grades slipped, they freaked out. When they came into my room to berate me about my bleak future, my mom saw some cuts on my arm because that's how I emotionally cope. I can't help it because my family doesn't like showing any emotion and it's just an outlet. She thought it was the work of the devil and immediately starting screaming at me to get up, yanked me up by my arm, and proceeded to ask me why I had to be depressed and told me it was selfish of me to be like this and to hurt her and the family with my depression and then she asked me if I was cutting for attention and that if it was, I might as well cut deeper and basically broke me down through a bunch of abrasive and violating questions and insults. My dad came in, already upset about the noise, and I hoped that he'd be rational and help me or something, and instead pulled me to the bathroom and shouted for me to bring out the thing i use to hurt myself. he uses this voice that shakes the whole house and i've only ever heard him use it when he is about to hurt me or my brother so I knew nothing good would come of it. Then they proceeded to corner me against the bathtub and told me to cut myself with it in front of them or else they would cut themselves and I was screaming and begging at that point to let me go and I was having an anxiety attack and then my dad just took the scissors and began cutting over and over again into his arm while telling me that it was what i was doing to them and told me that if I ever did that again I wouldn't be his daughter anymore. I thought they'd be sympathetic or understanding, but I guess this is what they really think of me. i really wish they'd know that my depression doesn't define me and that i can't control it but clearly that isn't the case.

41,"A little bit about me, I'm a 16 year old boy with a pretty bad, severely inhibiting stutter. Due to this I'm incredible shy and extremely quiet. I have a small group of friends but for the most part I'm relatively unknown in my school year.

I'm also petty smart. I'm not one of The super genius kids in all the gifted classes doing advanced maths and physics. I spend most of my day learning through reading, YouTube etc. I have a huge interest in history and I'm an avid reader. I would also say while I'm aware I don't know more than I do, I have pretty well developed political opinions. 

Basically I've always been one of the smartest in the class, I can usually choose to whether I want to try even a little bit and get and Top of the class or not try at all and get a B+. I get straight As in the advanced English class and was the only student to get an A in history in my School.

I recently made a friend who I would say is smarter than myself in many ways. He continuously says I act smug and has told me a number of my friends think I'm arrogant.

I'm a classic over-analyser and self obsess about the tiniest details. I can't believe how I would come of as arrogant. I barely ever talk about myself. I'm not an 'actually' person who constantly corrects people. As I've said I'm so very shy and introverted. 

I've come to the conclusion that people (particularly other smart kids) don't like being told their wrong, ever. Also my friends don't like when don't care about their outrage or something similar. But reading this seems like something an arrogant person would say.

Overall I would say I'm a more matured, well balanced, intelligent person who generally knows more about the world than most people in my year, I'm also very shy and quiet due to my stutter. 

I'm not sure what to think so I'd love to hear your input.",31May2017,3

Why am I seeing so many people fear mongering and acting like things are worse off nowadays - and only getting worse?

50,"Three weeks ago my girlfriend of 8 months broke up with me after a week break. When the moment came she expresses that she still loved me and missed but more as a friend than as a lover. She lost her feelings for me. She was mentally and physically exhausted from work and the relationship, and said she may not be ready for a relationship at all.

Since this was my first relationship, I was too clingy and took her for granted. I expressed this during our break up conversation, which by the way, was very friendly, no fighting. I said I realised what I had done and that I wanted to change. She had already made her decision though, as expected.

Here is the weird part, as a couple, we used to go to dance classes together every sunday. We broke up on Friday and next Sunday she texted me asking is I wanted to go anyway, saying we could always back out if turned out to be too awkward. Not knowing what to do (expecting No Contact), I agreed to go. Dance class was fine but afterwards we talked for about 3 hours about our entire relationship.

Basically, we both missed how much we used to do together and the memories we had. (She still wore the jewerly I gave her for Valentine's Day and Christmas). We decided that this could go one of two ways: either we wake up one day feeling happy alone, remaining close friends or we decide to try again after some dates in the summer.

At this moment, contact doesn't just happen occasionally anymore. She texts, sends pictures via snapchat, etc. nearly every day, to which I respond when I have time. Although it's never romantically charged (talking about school, both our lives, ...), she always instigates contact.

Last Sunday she proposed we have an extra night of dance classes together, on Saturday, to practice our moves that we learned when we were still a couple. She also sat down with me to discuss the next dance course, which would start late August. The reason why this bothers me is that these dance classes had a specific purpose: her oldest sister's wedding. We were supposed to go to the wedding together and to this day we have a hotel room booked, none of which has been mentioned since the break-up.

I want her back so badly but I can't seem to get into her head. Although the conversations and moments we share are very friendly and fun, something seems to be off about the whole situation. Since the break up, I have gone through some changes to show her that a potential relationship with me could be different (almost finished college, joined a gym, joined local pool, starting working more, hanging out with friends,...).

At times I feel very good but than complete fear overwhelms me that she may hurt me before (or after) the wedding of her sister. What should I do with this situation? Losing contact is nearly impossible with the dance classes, that we both want to do still. Should I just wait it out until the school year is over (we're both teachers, year ends in June) and then talk to her?

I want to give her time to feel better and to relax without completely losing me, because she seems to regret her decision on some levels. On the other hand, she made this decision that I never wanted, and now she initiates contact nearly every day. We have not talked about our situation in over two weeks and I sometimes feel uncomfortable not being in control about where this is going, afraid she wants me just as a close companion and dance partner.
I want to talk to her so badly about what the future holds but it's way to early for that, and waiting could end up even more damaging. Our relationship was awesome, without ever fighting. 

We supported each other and did everything together. The passion and the sex was amazing. What is the best course of action for me in the next weeks leading up to my graduation (1st of July) and the wedding a couple weeks afterwards?

60,"A bit of background:

Last night, me and my friend (his name is wolf) was ironically watching ""Lego Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu"". This was at 3 am, neither of us could sleep, so we watched it together on one of those fancy video streaming sites where you could watch the video at the same time with a friend.

Us having experience with Maya and Blender, wolf knowing how to model and me toying around with maya for a while has made us able to understand animation. Enough to understand the methods the show we watched where made. And we did nothing but tear it apart.

The rant part:

---

Good animation is not something you notice. The best animation is the animation that blends perfectly into the human brain and you dont notice its animated. Me, personally, when I play Overwatch (because I used SFM, I notice the animations in TF2 more then I do Overwatch) I dont notice the animations.

Its because the animation in overwatch is fluid; you dont notice it because of how fluid it is. There is a little (or relatively little; I dont know how many people know it exists) known game called Prototpye. Prototype is a game with good animation, but made for the ps3. Its problem is not its animation that makes you think about the games animation; but rather the main characters model in comparison to the world around him. 
 
Look up ""Prototype gameplay.""

Those are 3 pictures that essentially give you the feel for the games model of Alex (the main character). I want you to focus on Alex and think about how he looks in comparison to the world around him. His model does not blend in. And when he moves very fast with is abnormally bright model, it makes you think about how he was made, how something like that could slip threw the cracks.

The data (mostly scanned maps) was in batches of ~10 TB and our internal networks weren't built to handle that volume of data. Plus some of them were a wee bit sensitive.

Being the excellent problem solvers that we are, we started a full-out evaluation of available solutions: Dropbox/Onedrive/Google Drive/Amazon. I actually even made analytics! It took us a week to select and get budget approval.

Our receptionist, a lady with excellent people and management skills but not of a technical background, heard of the problem and asked us why we weren't just shipping the data through mail? We frankly had not considered that at all, 'cause we are all idiots. An initial enquiry told us registered speed post would send the hard drives in 2 days for the price of a lunch.

Politicians strip us of our basic needs, communities of people have no problem tearing a 16 year old girl limb from limb based on rumors of infidelety, 10 year old kids are being arrested for misbehaving at school, womens rights in America was just erased, extremists exist because the west wants oil even though we have found a better way......

 Ourselves. Not a government, not god, not a devil, not one regime. Want change? Stop the blame game and be productive. Stand up and say ""I'm fucking done I deserve better"". Otherwise shut up and embrace extinction. Cause it's happening. Right now.

There is no imginary foe.

Only us. Humanity. We don't have to do this to ourselves. All it takes is a little courage. Just enough to plant a fruit tree and give the sapling to an enemy.

Don't worry. They'll plant it. Food is food.

 My point is, all of us are scared and angry. Killing innocents will never solve anything.

War can not be ended with more war. If we want peace, we have to find it within our own hearts. It's been thousands of years now, it's time to stop. We don't need to control resources now, we just need to spread the knowledge.

So why are we still following ancient economics? The rich you say?

Eat them. We are Mother Earths guests, not her conquerers. She could shake us off like a dog with fleas at any given point. We need to demonstrate some respect, before we all become a statistic in some future aliens log.

Hawking says we've got 100 years. I'm inclined to trust his judgement. We can add time to that clock, but not without a collective effort.

""The only thing to fear, is fear itself' ~JFK

""Fear is the weapon of weak leaders"" ~Unknown

We don't have to be afraid anymore. We don't even need leaders anymore. If not for state red tape? Flint would have had clean water a year ago. And they know it. As a result, 8000 families are being forced to give up their homes.

It doesn't have to be like this. We have the tech, it just doesn't make the rich richer. It's time to stop idolizing what we see on tv. It's time to take care of our own. You don't have to be a Jesus or Siddarth to do the right thing.

Nothing will change until we decide to change it. Controling others is not the answer. The families we obsess over on tv? Useless. Not role models. We know how to fix this. We ""just don't feel like it""

67,"This just happened and I feel like I need to get it off my chest.   
So, a little backstory first. My friend, who's a diagnosed sociopath had work to 11pm and his parents couldn't be arsed driving him home. This is a regular occurrence as they're on pretty bad terms. Since it's a two hour walk, and unlike him I have a car and a driver's license, I usually drive him in their absence. The catch with today was that I start work at 4am tomorrow, and since he's trying his best to act ""normal"" and fair to me and his other friends, he said he'd just walk home so I could sleep. This is where the story begins.   
I care for him and I didn't want him to walk home in the dark on a traffickated road with no sidewalks, not to mention that even though it's the summer, it gets pretty cold here in Norway in the nighttime, so I showed up to drive him though it meant cutting my sleep short. This is where the conversation started.   
He was surprised that I showed, and re-stated that he could walk home as he's done it plenty of times before. I can be stubborn when I want to, though, so after a minute of insisting he got in the car. Ever since he told me about his condition a couple months back we've been pretty open about it between the two of us, so he wanted to know why I came, as he said it was something he would have never done for his friends. I explained that I cared more about him than I do a couple hours of extra sleep, and the conversation lead into me trying to explain that feeling.   
If you've ever tried to explain something to someone who's never experienced said thing, you probably know how hard it is. I know perfectly well that he can never care for me the way I care for him, but I've accepted that and tried to maintain a good relationship regardless. What really stuck to me is that when I tried to compare it to how I imagine he feels whenever something bad happens to him, he brushed it away saying that he never really feels bad about stuff, but just stops caring whenever he faces adversity. We discussed the topic through the trip and although he said I made more and more sense to him, I don't think he can ever truly get it. Just like how I can't imagine how it must be like to lack the ability to feel empathy, the contrary seems just as impossible to him. I don't know why I'm typing this or why it hits me so hard when we have these discussions, but ironically I just feel so bad for him. I know it's kinda stupid of me to keep treating him the way I do and always being there for him when he's literally unable to keep anything but what's best for himself in mind, but I want to maintain what we have and I feel like someone needs to be there for him. I guess this post is just my need to share our secret to get a bit of the burden off my chest. Anyway sorry for the rambling and bad formatting as I am on my phone. I don't know if anyone will actually even read through all this, but it felt good to type out.

68,"Hey! It's really late and I should be sleeping, but I was watching some of my old videos in my youtube channel and I felt like I really **had** to share this with anyone, and since the internet is my home, and reddit is my room, I thought this would be the best way.

I'd like to present myself first of all. I'm Jota, a portuguese guy who currently lives in Spain (will explain later) and has a little youtube channel. I'm 16 and my life has been something to really talk about. So let's get on.

Since I was a kid, I've always hated getting on with people, I've always wanted my own world. I have some mild personality bits that actually could be very little simillar to autism. I've always hated power and how people (mainly teachers) abused of it. And I've never had any problem to say what I think, to get on against the ones who were not fair and make justice. 

In primary school, my teacher was very bad for me. She used to blame everything on me, and she punished me all the time, she even beat me softly some time and what she used to do very often that I will always remember, she usually grabbed my hair hard and strong, and it hurt a lot. When I got out of that awful school, I went to secondary, or elementary, however you call it, year 5 and 6, I was.. uh... like 9 or 10? But I was one year ahead since I was 5 cause I behaved ""badly"" when I was little so I went to psychologists and they said I should be 2 years ahead, but my mother only let me advance 1 year, cause she said the other kids would be too much older. So those 2 years were fine, but hey! They were important, cause I started to watch youtube and play videogames. I was always a geek and a nerd, I remember playing GTA San Andreas when I was just only 6 y/o, and I used to spend entire afternoons playing or doing something in the computer. I discovered the whole youtube thing and I loved it. I gotta say that it was like 2010, very few people knew youtubers were a thing, and it wasn't a single bit like it is now. Then I went to a school professional music in year 7. Now that I think, I think I really didn't have any *friends* there. I was alone with my guitar and my pc, that by the way, was very bad, it could barely handle Minecraft at the time. But I was... *happy*, I guess. I just lived my life. My classmates fooled on me every time cause my laptop was bad, (fun story, they called me flipbook cause my fps were too low) and for other things, but mostly just because I was the weird kid. Like I've always been. However, I absolutely loved that school. Can't describe it, just loved it. But well I wasn't the best behaved kid there, so they... they ""invited me to go"". Yes, they kicked me out. Oh, important: **That year, I started my youtube channel**. I always had those kinds of problems, because I get angry very easily and do stuff that normal people don't understand. Sometimes I think because of that, added on the fact that I'm weirdo, I'm the *fool beast* of the class. But hey! My mother don't find job so we go to Spain! I spent that transition summer with my grandma, that I love. I absolutely love her very very much. I think she's the most important person in my entire life, probably. When I went to Spain, I had to learn 2 new languages (castillian and catalan) since I was in Catalonia. Everything was new, I was new to that so I could start everything over. But I was still me. Even though Portugal and Spain are right next to eachother, they are different worlds. So I go to the local high school and sign me up. But wait Spaaaain comes in! ""How old are you?"" they ask me. I say I'm 12. So they put me in a class with 12 year olds. My age, yes, but I presented all the documents that said I should be in a higher year. Man, that shit burnt me inside, it was too late and couldn't change it. I had repeated a year, even though I had **great** marks and I would have no trouble with a new country and new languages. But hey, it's Spain, the shittiest country in Europe and they do shit their way. So there I was, in school with people that were my age. I felt like everyone was dumb. I felt like I hated everyone. I felt like everything was shit. Plus, I had to share home with my mother's boyfriend and his daughter who I didn't like. A small house, 4 people. I just didn't have space. But it didn't matter because I had my pc :). I had my other world. When I was in the PC, nothing else happened. It's like nothing else existed. Only me and my online friends. And when nobody was in skype, I could just record a video, and if I couldn't, I would go and edit for hours. I just wanted to have someone, but not somebody, I hated people. I had my youtube, producing or watching. And I was happy. At least outside. My mother started to have problems home. At school, there was a girl that I liked. And she'll be important. She liked me too, but she was complicated because from day to night she didn't like me anymore. So next year we move to another house, just me and my mother. A fucking small ass house. Wooden. Bad electricity. Bad water. Bad everything, but it was what my mother could have for us. I hated it. In the summer, I talked a lot with that girl, but she ended up cutting the talking. Oh, I went to Portugal in the summer. The whole summer. Just as a note, people in Spain meet a lot, and I hated it, I thought it was just too ""social"", so stupid. 2nd year went normal, but I had my best friend who helped me a lot. He was like me. He legit seemed like my fucking lost twin brother. We shared everything and well... I can't explain how he is important for me. We are **always** together. Our tie grows to another level of friendship. I can say we're brothers. Actually, we were three, there was the other funny guy who we liked very much, but after that year, he failed so he stayed behind. So summer comes in, I go to Portugal, I had eventually returned to talk with that girl, and we talked a lot in the summer, until... guess what she said she wanted nothing with me again. And when I returned to school, I discovered she had a boyfriend, that then left her very stupidly. So 3rd year in Spain was really when the hard shit hit. I didn't have my girl, I didn't have shit, just that friend, so our relationship grew even more. Then I discovered Eminem, which is really important, it kinda helped me over everything, gave me strength and well, just helped me. Plus, I discovered Hip-Hop and since I knew about music, I started to do my little own things. Some rhymes and shit. Well and overall that 3rd year was just where I started to notice I wasn't well. Bad teachers, bad stuff at school... I ended up crying sometimes for no reason, random. But important, I kept making videos, and that's really important cause nowadays I can see me in those videos and I remember exactly how I was when I was making it. Some relevant shit, that year I also got a girlfriend during a month, an extremely sexual relationship, my first one though. I don't regret it, I think it was important to who I am now, but just something I don't admire from my past. Before the summer, after breaking up with that girlfriend, the girl from before starts to talk to me. And by that time I wanted to leave, to go to another country because Spain is so shitty, and I wanted to have proper studies and life. I fell in love again with her and just had to decide not to leave, even though everything was already planned out for me to go next year. I cancelled everything and I think this is the most important decision I've made in my life. I started to meet her and eventually in June we became more than friends. I decided to spend the Summer here and not go to Portugal. Plus my relationship with my father was very tense I did not want to see him. Since that moment, I started to get out of the black cloud that my life was involved in. I've became a better everything. Now I have my life. And I love it. My girlfriend is the most important thing that I have and we will be turning 1 year next June 12 :)

Now I see my videos and I can directly teleport to that moment. I can feel what I was feeling and I can imagine what I had around me. And I can only realise how much it has changed when I look back on how I was. Now, I do my Hip-Hop, my music, my videos, I play my games with my online friends, I laugh with my class friends, who are just 2 (my best friend has left the school, to another school, but he is still a great friend and we still play and talk). My relationship with my girlfriend is awesome and with my friends is very good, we joke around with everything. Something that I love is that even though when I was down as hell, I joked about everything, humor has always been around.

Damn, this post is large!! Sorry! Just really wanted to share it. I might make a song outta this!

To finish, ask me anything, anything, don't be afraid. I'm sure I didn't tell everything about me xD. But yeah, it's with ""Like Toy Soldiers"" by Eminem in my G230 headset that I finish this writting that I did with my loved G810 Oriom Spectrum. So I'm just gonna click ""submit"" with my G402 Hyperion Fury and let my awesome computer that I built that I ain't gonna bother saying the specs post it.

Thanks :D **Have an awesome day, you!!!**",31May2017,3
69,"Thanks for reading!! Long time, first time. 

Over the past year I was as depressed as I've ever been. I was diagnosed with testicular cancer, and had one of my testicles removed. Got dumped by the love of my life at the time (hence this username, I've curated it to well to not use it anymore) and was suicidal. I was drowning, I couldn't breath, constant anxiety. After crying every day for nearly half a year, and sitting on the website to buy all my supplies for an exit bag, I decided to get help. I started seeing a therapist. Huge help!! I would recommend anyone going through something to go to a therapist even for just one session. Therapy really helped me see reality rather than this false reality i was existing in. 

After a few sessions I decided to go to my hometown and visit my family and friends. This also really started turning things around. I went home in April, for three weeks, and before that from September to march I wanted to kill my self. Now I shower every day, started wearing my contacts again, brush my teeth, do laundry etc. After my vacation home I decided to start taking classes. Now I'm on track to become an addiction counselor to help people struggling. Several of my friends struggle with it and I know too many people dead now because of it. So now I'm on track for that. I gave my cute neighbor my number and we've been chatting lately! The thing is I decided to not be depressed anymore. I spent my twenties being depressed and I'm just so sick of it. I even went to the dentist today. I know that if I can pull myself out of the void that anyone can. Thanks for reading! I'm proud of myself!

70,I just went to eat at WH by myself and my waiter was so cute and his eyes were so pretty. I didn't say anything but I left a note on the receipt and now I'm just hopelessly thinking about him lmao. He probably has a girlfriend but that man had beautiful eyes. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh. ,31May2017,4
71,"For about two months during the summer I have to drive to work in the evening and the sun cannot be blocked because it is so low on the horizon. I have to stare at the sun and the road at the same time. 

FUCK!!!!

edit: regular sunglasses, sunvisors, and similar wont cut it. Needs to be something that detects the position of my eyes and the position of the sun and automatically puts a small black dot in between the two. ",31May2017,2
73,"Blunt language ahead. Long post. 

I have a fetish for the scent of dirty panties. I've had a fetish for dirty panties before I even knew what a fetish was. 

It was around puberty (and long before I actually had sex) that I was so fascinated about pussy and it's perfume. I sniffed so many pairs of dirty panties and raided so many dirty clothes hampers over the years (I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo) I eventually was able to articulate scents that were present in various areas of the fabric. 

I'm still so fascinated and contemplative about how such delicate folds of skin can transfix me and occupy so much of my thinking. I often think about the movie ""Perfume"" and how much the olfactory sense is often overlooked as being so primordial. 

Anyway, a few years back I wrote this copypasta about how much [I love the smell of dirty panties](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/225aox/so_my_friend_visited_japan/cgjo21t/). Eyebrows were raised, and it was generally looked at as just some freaky rambling. But I meant every word. Some took it as a joke, some were disgusted, some compared me to a wine connoisseur of panties (fun fact, I'm also pretty good at finding complex flavors in wine!) I was actually offered by several women to be sent their dirty panties to be evaluated for their zones! lol. I thought they were joking. 

Reddit gold was had, and I still occasionally post that copypasta just for fun. 

Well, today I was curious so I just typed ""3 zone scent panties"" into google. 

Mindblown.jpg

There are websites that use my evaluation of panty sniffing on their sites and FAQs about the 3 zones of scent. There are even YouTube videos that discuss these zones (they just slightly modify it). You can tell they're using my original copypasta by reading the original comment I wrote, and then reading or watching posts that were subsequently made afterwards. There are keywords and phrases they all use such as (peppery, refined panty sniffer, zone 1,2,and 3, time of cycle, diet, vestibule, etc.). 

It's amazing to me. 

Even here on Reddit, women will use the zones as descriptors of what to expect when you order from them. 

FYI for women that do this, a thong is obviously going to be Zone 3 heavy. Not all panty sniffers are ""refined"" panty sniffers, and the best zone 3 panties are not thongs from someone who doesn't wipe. It occurs naturally over 4-5 days on regular or cheeky panties. That is unless someone is into straight scat. 

Also, if you're looking for a way to drastically improve the look of zone two, you can take some mucinex. 

The scent of Zone 1 can be developed more by just touching yourself in that one spot occasionally throughout the days you're wearing your panties. Also, sporadically not wiping after you pee. 

I never knew until last night that what I wrote so long ago would have an impact on such a specific fetish community. 

I feel so honored!",31May2017,17
74,"　As is stated in the news below, President Trump sent out a tweet with the misspelled word “covfefe”. 

　This is a subliminal message to support the victims of the Illuminati, whose crimes are being spread around the world with such fury.

　This is part of the movement throughout the world to gradually take the risk and enlighten the world about the mind reading technology, organized stalking and electronic harassment crimes of the Illuminati.

　As President Trump is trying to expose the Illuminati, he is currently facing the vengeance of the entire world, and being placed in an extremely trying position. It can be said that President Trump’s face has actually turned pale on learning of their mind reading activities after his appointment.

　Everyone around the world should appreciate the bravery of President Trump.

75,"I know they are creepy and annoying sometimes but I've bought shoes, jackets, and other clothing I wouldn't have normally found because of them. Usually, I don't even buy the item directly from the site in the advertisement, but something similar from another site or even the same exact thing cheaper from another site.

I enjoy scrolling through and seeing something I'd like to own. Other times, it really sucks because I don't have very much money but overall, I like it. I know this makes me sound like a dumb consumer.",31May2017,1
