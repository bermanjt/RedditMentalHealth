1,"I had never thought about getting married and having kids. I was vehemently against having my own children. 
I met an amazing man and we are now engaged, but we were on the same page of growing old without our own children.

A couple months ago he woke up to me crying. I had decided that I actually did want to have my own children and I knew that kids cannot be a compromise so I prepared myself for him to leave me. Surprisingly, he had also changed his stance on being a father. 

Today we were taking a shower before we headed off to celebrate Mother's Day with his family. He rubbed my stomach and said that one day we will celebrate with our own child :)

It'll be at least 3 years before we start actively trying to conceive but I am excited and ready with my future husband by my side. We will make amazing parents and raise a phenomenal child together",15May2017,1
2,"My mom and I bought our phones at the same time, they're both logged into her itunes account and we're on the same plan, etc. Etc. Etc. We had a minor issue at first where we would both recieve each others texts, I don't quite remember how that issue was resolved but it was one way or another about a month later, it wasn't too big of a deal.

So for reasons that I won't get into here, in a moment of self exploration I decided to wear a dress, not only that, but I decided to take photos in said dress. (Despite my username, I have a dick) unbeknownst to me all of my photos were sent to my mom's iphone (and yet I've never recieved any of her photos) not but a week later cue the awkward convorsation with my mother that I simply did not want to have. 

&gt; ""Do you feel like you should have been born a girl?"" 


&gt;""No mom, no!!!!"" 


I flat out denyed it to her 

&gt;""well then I don't know why you would take these photos."" 

And I would keep denying it to her, but the honest fucking truth is that I don't know myself and this is not a convorsation that I am ready, willing or comfortable with having. I can't tell her yes or no without knowing the answer my fucking self! It felt like a serious invasion of my privacy. And every time that I think the incident is in the past, she'll bring it up a few months later and ask 

&gt;""you know that I will love you regardless of anything right?"" 


&gt;""No mom, fucking no."" 


&gt;""But are you trans?"" 


&gt;""Fucking no mom, leave it be!""


&gt;""I just don't know why you would take those photos then.""


 It's sweet and all that she's trying to be supportive, but I would hope that she would believe me when I tell her ""No!""

So immediately I tried to fix this by logging out of her itunes and making my own account, as well as any other account I could create for myself.

The next thing to happen was that every podcast that I had ever downloaded were downloaded to her phone, and I wasn't exactly listening to PG:13 podcasts either, so I won't really get into the details of that convorsation

So now with this incident long in the past, I have since moved onto a new phone and Samsung Glaxy S7 that I love way more than I thought that I would. And yet, I'm still having shitty problems with iphones, my mom just bought a new work phone that she claims she hasn't logged into any account with the way she describes it 

&gt;""I don't know why iphones just talk to eachother"" 

but apparently all of the notes from my *old* phone were downloaded over to her new phone, like wtf? And she inevitably found my old suicide note, so of course on today of all days she brought it up. Thankfully for me I was vague enough in the note that she didn't actually know that it was a suicide note, apparently she was under the impression that I was just planning to run away. So I reassured her that I wasn't and now I'm just hoping that she doesn't bring it up again. But I am tired of having awkward convorsations with my mother, next thing that you fucking know the two phones will start sharing browser histories, like wtf?!?! I don't want to share all things across all devices, like seriously, cut it the fuck out Apple! And I'm not tech savvy enough to prevent it. I hate this particular trend in modern technology just the over sharing of all information, the next thing you know facebook is going to post your nudes for you!!!!",15May2017,4

&gt;Balance of Power XV is a simulation of the world starting on January 1, 1990. Players may join as countries, parties, individuals, militant groups, intelligence agencies, or most any other position they can think of.

&gt;The game is played by sending a private message to the Gamemaster (aka GM, person in charge of the game, in this case Ismail) describing what you intend to do. ""Issue threads"" are created by the GM and dedicated to a specific issue. The messages players send to the GM result in him updating the thread as the issue develops throughout the course of days, weeks, months or years.

4,"So apparently I smoked a shitload of meth last night when I was blacked out drunk. I have not had a drink in years (not really on purpose, just didn't feel like it) and I guess I should have had more respect for the creature.  

Apparently I smoked a lot of meth through some fish bubbler thing. I don't know if the method of smoking matters. 

The last time I did speed was a handful of dexxies in like 1981 and it wasn't for fun, I don't know jackshit about any of this new stuff, not a fan, this shit has made me full on crazy. When does it wear off? 

I am 47 male 6'3 230ish. As far as I know, I only smoked, I don't go in for needles, but I don't fucking go in for drugs either usually so who the fuck knows. 

My mouth feels like I am on good cocaine. I am not. I also keep talking to myself. This is not good. I have shit to do tomorrow and being a fucking lunatic isn't going to mesh well with my workload. 

For what it's worth, the shit I smoked was probably extremely good, the folks I was with don't play around with garbage anything. I don't know if it being pure is good or bad as far as recovery goes. 
 

Is there anything I can do to get it out of my system quicker? I really don't want to do a bunch of searches on meth from my home pc, and I'd really like to be sane again if possible.

9,"Hi. My name's Kit. I'm crying right now, but that's not important. I used to put the backstory on these kinds of posts but I don't care anymore. 

I wish I knew what was wrong with me. By which I mean I wish that something was actually wrong with me and that I had some sickness that could be treated by a week of rest and drugs instead of mental illness. 

I had a normal life, dammit. I think back to the times I worked and smiled and daydreamed. The times I took small road trips to places out in the middle of nowhere. When my major motivation was to travel the world instead of just... get past each day. 

I'm twenty years old. I told myself I'd be fine when my mother went away for a day since my antidepressants seemed to be working. I wasn't. I shoved the anxiety down to my stomach but on Mother's Day, when she came back and we went out to eat, I broke down crying before we even got a seat. 

I see the psychiatrist on Tuesday. It shouldn't be a long time away, but for me it's 39 hours away. And when you live each day counting down the hours, that's an eternity. 

I keep noticing physical symptoms and hoping that maybe it's something else. I even missed my period this time around. But I've done all the tests: there's nothing. There's just nothing but my messed-up brain, that suddenly snapped from ""normal"" to ""this"".

It would be fine if it didn't hurt others. My crying and being down hurts others. My hospital bills hurt others. I can't do anything. I can't do classwork. I don't even work on projects anymore. I just can't. And sometimes I just get this... *rage*. Like I want to take someone's neck in my hands and snap it. And it frightens me.

I've already been to a mental hospital. It was complete hell and it only made things worse. I don't want to go to another one. 

I'm tired all the time. I just want to sleep. Forever. Until the pain goes away.",15May2017,3
11,"I am moving to a college far away from my current residence, come this fall.  This weekend I will be flying down there for Orientation for their Honors Students.

I never really went on many vacations before, but I've been to the College I will be attending a couple times already.

I'm sorta an Introvert bordering on Extrovert but I definitely havn't been as social lately, and I also have had a lot on my plate in the past year and I've been going non-stop until now.  I just wanted to ask if there are any tips or advice for making the most out of a College Freshman Orientation (it's a big school, for some context)?

Reddit has been a great place to laugh, read, and pass time. We saw a change in leadership with Ellen Pao stepping down, a cleanup with the mass banning of subreddits like FatPeopleHate, and now we're dealing with tD.

16,"Was in a party chat with some friends and one of them talks about front page posts consistently; We always chatted about them and what not whenever we played rocket league or xbox in general. Today he asked to see my profile and i agreed because i know i can trust him. I sent him my username in a private message and he began to search it. 

Once he found it, he began to read my posts out loud so the whole party could hear. I mean i don't post porn or anything but reddit is anonymous for a reason right? I asked him not too but i guess he didn't hear me and continued to do it. I said it a little louder and when he heard me he acted as if it weren't a big deal. He apologized but seemed half hearted. 
Not using a throwaway because i don't care if he sees this. I'm not mad, just venting. 

Am i overreacting? I mean shit, i have a history of being overly sensitive and i'm actively working on it but i don't know.

18,"its just so extremely sobering.

my mother passed away a few years ago, god rest her soul. so mothers day is always a bit of a depressing day for me and my family.

my lizard also died over the weekend, and i have a lot of guilt over it. i feel like i couldve done more for her and i didnt.

and lastly, today there was news that someone many of my friends knew or were close to had passed away. lover to a good woman for many years, beloved big brother figure, hilarious and good man. he lived in flint and as such suffered through the water crisis. i have not been able to stop thinking about him in particular. maybe its everything stacked on top of each other, but its just so incredibly sad to be. such a sudden death (like my mom). i believe he was in his 20s. from what i understand though he had a very fulfilling life and was surrounded by the people he loved. he kept strong through various hardships.

when my cat passed (she had been a daughter to me) my brother told me the most important thing was that she had a good life and we had been her loving family even as she got sick, and therefore her life was not wasted. i kept remembering that today. when i think of her, i only think of the support and happiness she brought me. i think thats the same image that young man left, and thats all someone could ask for when theyve passed on, is to be respected and celebrated.

i know this sounds very stupid, but please make sure to cherish the ones around you. pet, friend, family, no one you know is going to last forever. that is a very sad fact of life that all of us will have to deal with at some point. you never know when they will be gone. it could happen very suddenly, or over a long period of time. a lot of things in life are trivial, yet we make a big deal out of them. so please take a step back sometimes and you will probably realize that there are a lot of things you dont need to be worrying over or you are subconsciously exaggerating them when you dont need to. make peace with the people youve wanted to. life is very fleeting.

sorry for the dumb and serious post. ive had a lot of perspective changes since my mother died and i feel like those changes are worth sharing. she passed with many internal and external conflicts, and a lot of things in her life were caused by misunderstandings. so i think its important to try and prevent misunderstandings or conflict when its not needed. hopefully this didnt come off as too preachy either. and sorry for having it be all over the place, im just kind of typing as i think right now.",15May2017,1
19,"She told me she doesn't love me anymore  and the worst was knowing it was true.  I made mistakes I fucked up bad,  I don't cheat or hit, but I can't control my drinking or hold my anger.  I begged on my knees pleading for another last chance, I didn't deserve one or even being with her. I don't know where I would be without her support the last almost 3 years.

She might as well be dead being that far away,  because there's no chance to see her ever again. I was careless. I hope I could help someone else help remember  to show some love before they get their heart broken.

7 years of reasoned responses.  Last night I spent ~40 minutes on a comment reply in  /r/PoliticalDiscussion and ... insta-ban.   Poof! Just like that gone, oh and by the way don't come back for a while...

There are often no appeals, and when you do appeal mods act like no matter what they're correct, twisting logic into some absurd puzzle and you're some horrible human being.  OR This is a really hard job, I don't have time to listen to everyone's reply. 

I mean, my comment from last night went across the board into several point by point break downs to reply in-context to the original poster.

If the effort I expend to try to remain on-topic, and well stated just gets dropped like that, why should I continue? Why should anyone?

Is it a lack of mod tools?  Do mods need better tooling to be able to perhaps ""drop a paragraph"" from a comment while it gets placed under review? 

Why are we becoming 'word police' governing the things people can and can't say when they aren't even being used to ""hurt"" people.

35,"I'm 24 and I already feel old as hell.

I've been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, a diagnosis that bothers me a lot even though it's probably accurate.

A month ago I decided to make a bit of a change. I stopped drinking, I stopped smoking cigarettes and I made an effort to at least cut down on the ganja. I'm not smoking at the same rate now, bit I feel like I'm slipping back into the old routine. Maybe I'd smoke even more if I wasn't hiding it from people.

I don't fit in with my family, I'm not a 'Nerd's-nerd' kind of guy despite my diagnosis, I'm (sort of) depressed and paranoid but I hate staying inside all day. For me, an aimless stroll is better than sitting on my ass in front of a computer, at least once a day.

The place I live in is basically just a tiny room, I really need to get into some healthy activities.

I suck at sports, maybe I'd be good at long-distance walking but that's silly as fuck right?

Being bisexual isn't too bad now that I'm no longer a teenager but it still contributes to the whole awkwardness and dishonesty in day-to-day life that's always plaguing me. I'm not too crazy about signing up on Grindr or something, I don't wanna get PM's from ultra-muscular studs who think I'm either into their type or in denial. +Bars aren't really an option, unless there's a classy way of sipping water in a dim-lit corner.

I don't really get a whole lot of compliments, and I have a pretty bad self-esteem, so hearing this made my entire day. I probably smiled like a total idiot when she said that to me. I realize it probably isn't that big a deal, but it was the best thing anyone has told me in months.

40,"I'm only 21, but my parents had be old--at 43. They're in their mid 60s now. It's not something I used to think about often but now I literally can't stop thinking about it. I graduated in December and moved half the country away with my fiance. I just feel so young. I'm a late August birthday, so I was already one of the youngest in my class, and I graduated early and now I have this full time job and a cat and a fiance. And I love it, I'm doing what I want. I've made no (huge) mistakes. I even moved to the city I always wanted to move back to. 

But my parents both smoke, and they're getting older. I don't want kids--at least not for another 8-10 years--but I feel selfish because they might not know their grandparents. And sure we disagree on many things (I mean, look at that age gap!) but they're great people. I can't imagine not calling my mom or dad, or never hearing their voice again. I don't believe in God anymore, no matter how hard I try, so I also have to live with knowing that when they're gone, I'll never see them again. I'm also an only child, so while I know millions and millions of people have gone through losing their parents, no one has ever or will ever go through losing *my* parents. 

I can't stop thinking about it. Every time there's a death in a movie, I think about it. Every night before bed, every slow hour at work, every long drive home. I know in my rational mind that I probably have a good 10-20 years left with them, and that they likely won't die suddenly--it'll be a slow health decline and I can brace myself better. But my irrational mind feels like I'll never recover. I feel lost without them. I have a wonderful guy at my side and I'm just starting to make a life for myself on my own, but I still feel so lost.

Will it get better once I'm better established? Or when I have my own kids and more things to focus on? Is this normal right after college?
