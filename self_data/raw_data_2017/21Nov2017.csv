0," I had a circular patch of itchy skin that the doctor initially thought was ringworm. He prescribed me an anti-fungal cream and told me it's usually a 4-6 week treatment time. He also said at one point ""it could be something else, but you would have to fail treatment for it to be that."" After 8 weeks of no improvement and it suddenly getting bigger, he prescribed a corticosteroid instead. 

But the rash didn't go away, and some smaller ones started showing up, and today was my third appointment, where he said it looks more like psoriasis now, and referred me to a dermatologist. 

I just got done reading about psoriasis and I'm just so depressed by it. I don't want to have something that's never going to go away and is going to require constant treatment, but more terrifying is the possibility of psoriatic arthritis. It sounds painful, debilitating, and just plain awful. It also suggests that having psoriasis increases my risk significantly for several cancers.

Right now I just feel like I want to cry. This suggestion just happened today, but I feel like the beginning of lifelong issues that are never going to stop bothering me. I just don't know what to do. ",21Nov2017,0
2,"I can’t believe I ignored how much you loved me. I can’t believe I didn’t realize how I was the center of your universe. The way you made me feel, like I was the best that could ever be, but I pushed you away. I took you for granted, I thought you’d never leave; because how could you love me so immensely and then just stop? It didn’t make sense then that I could completely demolish someone’s love, until I did.

I never meant for this to happen, I never wanted to push you away. I loved every little piece of you, and I always will, but I misused the love you gave me. I fed my narcissistic ego with it. I selfishly filled every void within me with your love, and it was never enough. My soul was deprived of everything. It had holes from people who’d just left, and I used your love to fill them. I was needy and I kept asking for more, until I sucked you dry. Until you were incapable of giving and fighting. Now that you’re close to being gone, I feel empty. I am empty, because to me, you weren’t just you, you were every person who had ever left or betrayed me. You were every void and every piece of me. You were everything and everyone, but I never realized that until you had enough. I took from you without thinking about you for a second. I was selfish and I was ignorant to you and your feelings. I’d give anything to take that back.

I know you may never see this and I know that I’ll never have the guts to open my heart like that to you, but I want to apologize.

I sincerely apologize to you. I’m sorry I couldn’t love you the way you loved me. I’m sorry for putting you second when you should’ve been first. I’m sorry for making you wait all this time. I’m sorry that I never trusted you enough, but I’ve been through so much and I’ve seen too much that my walls couldn’t just fully come down. I’m sorry I lash out at you sometimes. I’m sorry if I ever made you doubt your love to me, because you couldn’t have loved me any better. I’m sorry I pushed you away, because now I’d give anything just to have you back. I’m sorry I made you run through hoops just to please me. I’m sorry I was ungrateful of you, but you are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I’m sorry I couldn’t love you the way you loved me, because now I know that if I spend my whole life searching, I’d never find someone who would love me half as much as you do. I’m sorry for not appreciating all that you’ve done. I’m sorry if I ever made you feel like a burden. I’m sorry I have a temper, I know you hated me for it. I’m sorry I took you for granted, when I should’ve given you the world instead.

But most of all, I’m sorry I couldn’t love you the way you loved me. If things could change, If you could let me love you again, I’ll never let you go. I’ll never break your heart, I’ll give you all I have, and I’ll love you with all my heart, unconditionally.

If only you could let me love you again, because, Jessica I do love you.",21Nov2017,1
3,"For a while now, I've contemplated leaving New York City. This place has just never been good to me, and I just can't make it work for me either. I never really made a plan to leave; I just knew I wanted to and continue to want to. I tease myself with adventures I can't afford to states I'd never been to. On one of my ventures I met a lovely woman that lives in the Midwest. I wouldn't have imagined, but we liked each other so much that we began dating...long distance. 

As you can imagine, that created more motivation to leave here than ever before. We see each other now and again but you don't need me to tell you that it would be way better to establish something more permanent. So what's the problem? It's hard for me to talk about this because it's pathetic but I'll try. I'm scared. I feel like I'd never been a functioning adult and that I'm living a lie. I just turned 29 years old recently and still have no idea what I'm doing. 

* I don't know how to drive. I can't even imagine myself driving. Could that ever be a thing? 
* Can I work a ""real"" job? Could I learn new skills that are more than just plugging in stuff? 
* I'm scared. I don't know what I should be considering when moving to a different state; like I don't even know if I should cancel my health insurance or...what.

An hour later, she won and said I had from her dorm, all the way across the quad, back to my own dorm...wearing nothing but my underwear.

I timidly stripped in the bathroom (for some reason it was really embarrassing to strip in front of her), and walked out.

""Oh look, he wears tighty-whities! I knew it!"" she laughed. The other 6 people (4 girls included) laughed too.

Before you get any ideas, she has a serious, longterm boyfriend.

As I sheepishly walked out of her dorm after losing the game, she grabbed the waistband of my undies, pulled them back and said:

""Just be lucky I'm letting you cover this cute, round bubble butt with your briefs. I could make ya run back to your dorm NAKED! hahaha""

She then let it SNAP back hard against my butt and laughed hysterically as my undies-clad butt ran off into the brisk night air wearing nothing but my white briefs, glasses and a pink blush on my cheeks.

I was with a very manipulative, abusive person. I wasted 8ish months of my life doing everything for them. I moved states and left my family behind. They'd sit on their ass playing video games and watching tv all day while I worked my ass off in a labor intensive job. Then I'd come home and have to cook and clean the apartment, I never got any help. 
They racked me up 1,500$ in debt, maxed out my only credit card and made it so I couldn't make the payments plumiting my credit score. 
They took my paycheck everytime it came and I could barely make rent and utilities, which got turned off once. 
They hit me, told me I was fat etc.
Don't ask why I stayed so long, I don't have an answer. 
They played the victim everytime if they didn't get their way and used various excusies such as mental illness as to why they couldn't get a job. It was bad.
I could go on for hours.

Sad that my state is so poor. So few jobs. People get educated and then they leave the state because there isn’t any here. Sadder part is delegates from my state came to speak in one of my classes and reminds me how unmoving people are about certain bills. Budget cuts to education being the last thing you want he said. “1 dollar you spend on education is 7 dollars you are supposed to get back.” He said... but not when our educated can’t make their dreams here he went on. The fact they know this pains me. 

Drugs are such a issue here. Sad that once I’m done with college I will most likely have to move away from family but that’s life. Maybe I’ll get a job that helps out with this fucking opioid crisis.

24,"Last may I was extremely suicidal, my girlfriend was in a mental hospital for extreme anxiety and duicidal idration, and my dad was on an opiate drug bender in a town in Northern California. I was also being heavily emotionally abused by my mom and extended family. I had only recently turned 16.

I went on /r/suicidewatch because my girlfriend had told me over the phone that she tried snorting benadryl in the mental hospital. This made me extremely upset because of my dad and how he'd snort pills even though obviously Benadryl is different from painkillers

I found a post from someone who was going to kill themselves and leave notes behind for their three children. And talk about how they fucked up and I forgot the rest but it mentioned evil. I remember feeling horrible for this person, who seemed like a mother, and I went to go comment to try and help them. Maybe that sounds ironic but it's why I was on /r/SuicideWatch. I found relief in helping others in my pure hell

I have the screenshot but I refuse to look at it right now I don't have the courage to and that's okay. 

I see someone offer the OP a last beer. And the reply was ""I'm in a middle of nowhere town in Northern California, [insert name of town my dad was in]""

Jesus fucking Christ, those MOMENTS are etched into my mind. The extremely momentary wonder of ""Hey, but that's where my dad is...""

And then the horror when I saw his username. The username we had found before when trying to find evidence of his opiate benders. The username he used to meet my mom on AOL in the late 90s.

I screamed, I screamed and ran to my mom and what ensued was pure chaos, we spent the whole night tracking his down to make sure he was alive. 

I read the top post on offmychest. And seeing someone want to off themself, being so similar to my dad... I realized as I read it that I was actually thinking they may be my dad.. because of the night that I had found his suicde note.

Claim /r/thathappened all you want. but every moment of that is etched into me and I am crying and breaking down. This is how I'm trying to cope

27,"I got kidney stones on Sunday and just passed one, what an odd feeling. My mind went to something I try not to think about on a regular basis but my stone was keeping me up and thinking about my childhood. Particularly the father of my childhood friend. Now I’m very uncomfortable with lots of attention, very anxious, quite depressed. All this is likely related. But i have this idea that I should do what I’m most comfortable with... typing to him. Just putting it on there and tagging him. I’ve ignored every single one of his messages but he goes through phases where he says hey, and I never respond.

I’ve been dealing with so much shit at work and with this kidney stone and somehow this still came up top. I’m not even sure it’s healthy to be dealing with all these problems at the same time without sleep. 

Here’s my memories:

I remember being asked to take off my pants in his pool and go skinny dipping with him and his son at night. If anyone was awake there were people who could see his backyard... but it was at night

This next thing is vague but I remember on more than one occasion being in the bathroom with him. I’m quite certain that during my shower he stepped in to pee regardless of there being two other bathrooms in the house.

He would sleep naked and walk around naked during the day in full view.

He was drunk a lot and seemed angry most of the time.

He had two sons.

I remember that he worked in a kids group home... and that’s where it all really fucking hits me.

For a long time I struggled to rationalize if any of those things were just innocent. Family stuff. Do other families do that? I wasn’t family but I was an only child who spent a lot of time there. I don’t remember if he ever touched me, I really don’t. 

It wasn’t until today where I just made it simple for myself. I asked would I do any of those things with someone’s child in the house. And it’s vehemently no.

I’m not over exaggerating right? Like I need to know what the right thing to do here is. This happened many years ago I was 12-13 when I left the neighbourhood, saw him twice since and that friend and am now 27 (28 soon)

Now some fucked up things. I’m gay and I’m attracted to older men. I often bring it back to this experience or “blame” it on this. Christian home. But I have come out and I have been dating an older man and I do love this man... who does not know about this past. I’ve decided this isn’t my reason for why I’m attracted to older men necessarily but do not consider it a bad thing anyways. 

Again I hate attention of this thing blows up I’m going to have some serious anxiety and I’m sorry if I can’t respond to you or whatever, some of my social hang ups still come in to play online, but I express myself better here (sorry for any weird auto correct mistakes) if it’s just one response I can handle that. 

I just really want to know what the right thing to do here is. I heard he isn’t working any more. The only people who I know could confirm this are his sons maybe his wife who worked a lot and was quite absent. If I go through with this I’m tearing all these people apart. Before I do something stupid I need to know I’m doing the right thing. Please help me out.

To be honest it did feel good having friends and social appointments. But today, 2017, i’m no longer ashamed of being a nerd. Maybe it’s not shameful to have social anxiety. Maybe it’s ok to have awkward moments, and not have to be charming and debonair. I hated my 2003 self for the longest time, wanted to erase all traces of it. You know what? That person wasn’t a piece of shit. That person was just quiet. So folks, make peace with the persons you were back then. Self hate can make you feel obliged to do totally unnecessary things.

33,"Hi Mr. Chairman,

I am a 21 year old computer science student and I have been hearing a lot about net neutrality lately; I am not so sure where I stand. Lots of people are telling me that the bill introduced in 2015 is extremely important and we could lose a lot of our rights on the internet if it is repealed. The internet is very valuable to me, and I think you agree that it is provides significant value to everyone. I wanted to ask you some specific questions about your policies. You seem like a very smart person with some good ideas, but there are some that I don't understand about what you have said in the past.

Firstly, I wanted to ask about the political motivations behind the 2015 bill. You have mentioned in interviews that the policy was heavily politically motivated. I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. Who is benefiting from this legislation, and how?

Secondly, I wanted to ask about growth in the industry. I think you and I both agree that the everyone would benefit from more ISP choice and a more competitive market. What parts of the 2015 bill make it difficult for a small ISP to start up? Have we seen a decline in new ISPs since 2015?

Thirdly, I think we both agree that privacy is a human right, including while you are online. Is there an incentive for ISPs to not sell my personal browsing data? If supply and demand says that goods cost whatever people will pay, how will a hidden cost in privacy affect that process? Will prices still go down if people don't understand that they are giving up their privacy? I understand that the goal is to incentivize ISPs to expand to lower income areas, but will I be able to find an ISP that won't collect my data? Is there another way to expand internet access?

Lastly, and sorry if this question is a little rough, but I wanted to mention about legislating problems with the internet before vs after they become problems. My simple suggestion is to think about the fact that the people of America have expressed their thorough disapproval of repealing the 2015 bill, and you have ignored their wishes and continued with the repeal. I understand this is because you believe that this is what is best, but how much trust do the American people have in you to legislate issues after the fact if you won't listen to them now?

I would love to hear back from you, I hope this message has been constructive and please don't think of me who would disagree with anything you say. I want to understand where you are coming from so I can better understand what is going in the country I live in.

Thanks for your time and all the best,

Then I stared having panic attacks and headaches, just blinding migraines and freak outs over nothing. All started in April. Freaked out that I'd get fired because I was freaking out all the time. Endless cycle.

I got myself into a decent enough place mentally and then my sister got pregnant, which was great! All on the upswing.
Then my great-grandmother passed, which didn't affect me all that much, but still sad. My grandfather was also taken very ill around this time, too.

I got a ring and proposed on the beach in July, and everything seemed okay for about a month.

Then, out of nowhere, my grandmother dies. Her mother had passed just a few months earlier and her husband was the ill grandfather from before. This might as well have kicked me in the chest. This loving old lady spent her life caring for everyone around her didn't get a fucking chance to be a great-grandmother or even know that her grandson was getting married.

Also, on the same fucking day, my fiancés grandfather passed and she had to fly home. So I was alone for a week. I'm still reeling from that day. It's getting closer to my wedding day and my sister gave birth to a healthy baby girl, so things are swinging up again.

So I played intermediary and when he joined the troupe he told me first, super excited.  So I joined the forum to support him, keep tabs on the show, be a fan basically.

Well he moved on but I stayed connected.  Well I made an innocent comment I thought was funny, was a rhyming word play joke that at the time I thought was cute, but was interpreted to be something else and BAM I’m now being harassed to hell and back by a group of pretty damned aggressive folks on this forum.  I tried to explain it was a joke, not intended as they took it, just an innocent word-play joke but, nope, I’m fat shaming someone who is transitioning based on my joke.  So, they’re online stalking me and harassing the fuck out of me.  Apparently a “I’m really sorry, I didn’t intend it to come across that way, I never intended it to be anything but funny” equals “I’m a lying piece of shit that deserves to have my job and life ruined”.

Luckily what they “think” is my job is an old business I use to run that is now run solely by my old business partner who is a good friend of mine, but also an asshole.  They got hold of him via social media and blasted me as the most hate monger, anti-homosexual transphobic evil human being that ever existed.  My old buddy told them don’t worry, he fired me when he realized I cooked and ate puppies and as far as he knew I was homeless only able to use the internet from the library to find work.

While, what he said was funny, it doesn’t actually change the fact that these guys are ALL OVER me for something that isn’t real.

When you’re painted as bad you can’t change anyone’s mind to the contrary.

I think this is pretty indicative of today.  People accuse you of a thing and there is no explanation, denial or apology that will undue the accusation, the belief that it’s true, and the justification of whatever hardship they are able to put you through.

Also: I have done this mistake earlier, and therefore I am afraid of how this will affect my resume for furure employers.

52,I blame both those India-based scamming cocksuckers as well as the retards who will actually give money over the phone to these fucks. Fucking idiots,21Nov2017,0

54,"If they want that responsibility, let's give it to them.  We already see protections for Google and others being degraded.  It seems like the ISP's have bought and paid for their little imp at the FCC, he will do whatever it takes, no matter how underhanded, to do his masters' bidding.  Let's make this a case of ""be careful what you wish for,"" and slam them with so many lawsuits, class actions, and complaints, that it becomes more trouble than it's worth.",21Nov2017,0
55,"Maybe ""friends"" isn't the right word because I don't really have friends, the closest I have is this girl in my class that probably tolerates me out of pity, anyway I've been having suicidal thoughts for a long time now, and recently I've started to self harm too (nothing too serious), and it's been weighing me down a lot. I don't know if it's appropriate to talk to her about it or if I should keep to myself (my heart says the latter). Anyway if nothing else at least I told Reddit. I hope your day is going well. Sorry for being dramatic!",21Nov2017,2
57,"You know, those people who are too ashamed to poop and fart while other people are in the bathroom at the same time. You can spot a shy pooper when it’s quiet from his stall with no sounds or signs of progression in his poop. He’s just waiting for the other people to leave before he unleashes a huge loud fart/shit. I on the other hand have no problem with releasing loud shits, but I’ll take my time in the bathroom. I’ll wash my hands twice, check the mirror. Walk around maybe. These guys are clenching their assholes trying to keep in whatever monstrosity is trying to escape. Sometimes I open the door but don’t really walk out and just stand there and let the door close. These shy shitters will think I left and let out a huge fart and finally relieve themselves. I give a low laugh/snicker, loud enough so they can hear, then I actually leave the bathroom.

59,"I am going to create a video to try and radically influence the general perspective on net neutrality by relating to the antagonism present in this repeal. We need to rally and get as many people as possible on the same page to understand that this decision is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the American people. It is an abuse to our government which has organized the infrastructure of our communication lines. It is an abuse to the customers: imagine if you had to pay different amounts of money dependent on who you tried to call on the phone within the country. It is an abuse to our freedom of speech, as this would give corporations control over who gets a voice on the internet, which is absolutely a violation of the principals we ought to fight for as free citizens. Please contribute any ideas that can help get the point across! Even go and make a video yourself about why net neutrality is detrimental to our freedoms!",21Nov2017,0
62,"This happens occasionally with negative emotions. It feels really weird like there's this glass wall between me and those emotions, and I can't quite get to them. I end up going numb.

Has anyone else ever experienced this? Or understand what it is?",21Nov2017,1

65,"We buried my uncle yesterday. A man whom words just simply can’t describe. And now he’s gone. 
I watched him die for the last year as he battled prostate and bone cancer, which then spread to his liver and lymphatic system. I’m grateful he’s not suffering anymore, but I’m left with a sadness I wasn’t prepared for.
I stood at the end of his bed as he took his last breath, his right foot in my hands, the only part of him I could reach with our family all claiming a spot around him. I watched as his wife told him it was ok to let go, and he did. 
I feel like I’m drowning. Just when I catch my breath and feel some relief, the pain and sadness drag me back under. I can’t stop thinking about how he looked, what his last words were to me while he could still talk, the flicker of a smile when he recognized I was at his side, the softness of his hair as I  stroked it one last time at his viewing. 
I think about happy times and the fact that he’s in a better place, but the darkness is never far behind. 
I’m tired of crying all the time. I’m tired of people looking at me like I shouldn’t be grieving this much. I’m tired of avoiding people because one wrong look will send me into a crying spell. I’m tired of feeling like I have absolutely no control over my emotions. I’m just plain tired.",21Nov2017,4
66,"But really? [this](https://i.imgur.com/5602aEM.jpg) I have my Frontpage set to popular in Canada. Why on earth does every single subredit need to have it's own post? I'd like to see it once or twice at most, would be a much more enjoyable experience.",21Nov2017,2
68,"From time to time I feel like viewing /r/WatchPeopleDie, but I don't want to subscribe to it. I get to it by going to /r/WTF, then in the ""Shout Outs"" I click on /r/MorbidReality, then in their ""Other Subreddits"" finally click on /r/WatchPeopleDie. Does anyone else regularly get to subs like this?",21Nov2017,2
