7,"I think I'd rather kill a million people before being suicidal or self harming ever crosses my mind but plucking my pubes out is SO addicting. That area is bloody and sore and it hurts afterwards (in a bad and dull pain way) but I get such a pleasant combination of pain and adrenaline when I pluck them. I like to just ""pull"" on them too to feel the sting for as long as possible until they get plucked out. Idk man. WTF is wrong with me?",11Dec2017,1
8,"3 years ago when I was 13, I was playing basketball and it was a home game... so our white uniform. My period usually starts at night and is very light. I was also a very important player on this team. Anyway, 3 minuets after the start of the game it’s timeout time and the coaches wife pulls me to the side and tells me my best friend noticed that I was bleeding, which obviously must have started during the game. So I go to the bathroom and she tries to find some supplies. I didn’t have anything with me because my period wasn’t supposed to start for another 2 weeks. I was basically panicking because my team needs me. At 13 I was 6ft tall and playing starter for Junior High, Junior Varsity and Varsity. I had a Varsity game an hour after our game and didn’t know what to do. I called my mom (since my dad brought us and he couldn’t leave because my younger brother had a game afterwards) who was somewhere else and told her to pick me up so I could go home and regroup and get cleaned up. But just a backstory, I had had my period for about 2 years. My mom only knew about it for 1 year, that’s how secretive I was. I never told my dad, I’m sure my mom did but I never wanted to. Well come to find out, my dad comes out to find out why the hell I’m not playing anymore because my team is losing! Coaches wife tells him why... I wish she would have told him I was just sick or anything. I don’t know why I didn’t want him to know, he has a mom, wife, and 4 sisters. I guess I just never wanted to be a “woman” you know? I always wanted to be tough, and bleeding out your vagina didn’t seem so tough to me. IDK. He was cool about, but I found out later he texted my mom “she left w/ coaches wife, i went and asked her, wife said she had her period! WTF!” I was mortified! Anyway. My mom picked me up, went to the store and bought a shit ton of pads and tampons (still hate those words) and new undies. We went to my grandparents, and my grandpa was there which was embarrassing, again, don’t know why lol. But I acted like it was no big deal, I happens, blah blah blah. I don’t really mind that my friend and coaches wife knew. I don’t know if they told anyone else but oh well. I don’t care about that, nobody has said anything further. But to this day it haunts me that my dad knew!!!! Again, I love my dad and have a good relationship with him. I was just mortified! To top off my day, my parents where joking about it with me (I was the only one that understood) and my 12 yr old brother said “yeah right before the game I spilled red gatoraid on my pants” 
Of course my mom adds in “oh just like your sister” 
The rest of the night he was asking “you spilled gatoraid on your pants too?” And I never answered him lol. 
I think that’s why I hated telling my mom stuff, because she told everyone else! (Sort of unintentionally. Idk) 

So yeah, that’s my story. It feels good to tell someone! Still, FML.",11Dec2017,1

11,"So I'm coming to terms with my depression, and I'm going back home from uni for Christmas soon. I've been debating on whether or not I should be honest about how I've been struggling lately. On the one hand I wanna be honest and I think it would help me to talk to them about it. 

On the other hand they have their own shit they struggle with (like everyone else). Feel like it's selfish to come home crying about my life. I know it's like a chemical imbalance or whatever but I still feel so narcissistic, I just wanna be their strong rock like always, maybe they need that more than I need their support.

I have a girlfriend, and she love snad i love her, but she feels i never get better, i dont achieve anything, im not independent. this goes to what ive always been, and why my first girlfriend broke up with me.
My mom created me like this, always doing everything for me always helping too much, and so this is the result.
Even though i do achieve things, and want to d things, never get around to it.
I'll try, and I know what you're going to say.
I just feel like i can't change, and even when i do, everything will keep on beeing shit.
Since i have no friends, and sometimes my girl feels like she has too much to deal with me and doesnt look up to me, i really wish i could kill my self, but i wont because of my parents.

13,"I feel silly. I was so angry. I was fighting with my SO or whatever he is, I felt just so much bottled up rage from everything else going on in my life right now and I just needed to hit something. But I don’t like lashing violence out to people,  so instead I started slapping myself in the face so hard it was beat red, and I ran my nails down my neck. They aren’t even that long, but I almost ripped my mole off, it’s hanging by a thread and won’t stop bleeding. 

There’s also scratch marks all on my neck. I look stupid. His friends just asked me “who fucked you up?” Oh it was me. Because I’m fucking stupid and so fucked up in the head. The anxiety won’t go away and it feels like it’s killing my brain. I feel like I’m about at a breaking point.",11Dec2017,3
15,"My (23F) parents were abusive. We were (are in their case) part of the Christian Fundamentalist community, but on the fringes for the most part (my mother did not want to home school me and my sibling along with a few other things). My mother especially so with my father just not caring or willing to protect me from her. They made sure I spent my life with few friends and no skills to speak of. I fell through the cracks in high school, and think I probably graduated with a 2.8 GPA. I wasn't allowed to go to college, and the only job I was allowed to have was the local grocery store in the same parking lot my mother worked so she ""could keep an eye on me"". I had my license, but was only allowed to drive to work and back.  

I was able to get out thanks to someone I had considered one of my best friends. She paid for me to come live with her in another state, and put me up rent free for a good bit of time until ""I was on my feet"". I was, and still am, grateful for her, but she's not the person I thought she was. I didn't expect her to be the same person she was when we were teenagers, but she's a stranger now. She's happy to sit in the apartment with her girlfriend and do nothing but smoke weed and complain. Neither of them clean, and they're content to let dirty dishes mold where they sat them, let their dogs pee everywhere, and just otherwise be filthy. Her girlfriend doesn't clean at all, because ""its gross"", but she's the one helping make it this way. 

She made all these grand promises about how great things would be out here and how much she couldn't wait for me to be out here. Only once I got out here I'm stuck feeling like I'm the biggest burden she has. 

I'm not going to lie when I say I don't have very many skills. I'm socially awkward, and my parents made a point to keep me as sheltered as they possibly could. I don't understand budgeting or communication, and a lot of things people consider common sense seem to go straight over my head. 

I want to learn, but when I have no idea where to start it seems impossible. 

Especially when my roommates make me feel like I'm an idiot or a child. I feel belittled and condescended around them, and I can't really speak up about it considering just how much I owe them. 

I'm not happy where I'm at, and I don't really know how to change it. I can't really seem to save up the money I need to to move out, and its hard to find roommates here. I never went to college, so I can't really get a job that pays the sort of money that would make things like that simple. I would love to go, but besides feeling its too late for me I have no idea what I would do. I don't really know what my interests are or even what I'm good at. 

A part of me just wants to go back ""home"", and beg my parents to bring me back into the fold of the family. At least there I knew who I was, what I was expected to do, and what my worth was. 

Right now I just feel empty and worthless.",11Dec2017,1
16,"  Unfortunately I can’t write too much in the way of a detailed post right now; I’ll do my best to put my thoughts to paper though. I’m a senior in high school now, and while most everyone I know is cruising through the year and waiting for the day that they can graduate and go on to college (and eventually a bread-winning career). Where am I? Struggling to piece my life and character together. 

  To be honest, it’s probably not that bad. What I’ve done is that I’ve spent the whole of high school sort of coasting through it. I took on challenges every now and then; I joined JROTC for a couple of years, and took a couple of AP classes (and did fine in those). However, I’m failing a number of classes, and I have to make up a couple of others. I won’t say I regret it though; to say that would imply that all the great and magical experiences of these past few years were all mistakes. Of course, I do wish I put in the hard-work that I *could* have put in. Writing this now, I definitely get the feeling that I’ve disgraced my myself and potential (as all people have potential). 

  I can’t seem to shape up. As I write this now, I’m genuinely trying to improve myself in every metric. However, over these past few years, I’ve shirked responsibility for things. Maybe because I still feel like a kid (I certainly look pretty young, now that I mention it). 
It could be, as Theodore Roosevelt has put it, that I’ve allowed play to vastly outweigh work (which he says is a dismal life). Even now, I have an essay that’s more than 2.. maybe 3 weeks overdue for Christ’s sake! There has to be something wrong with me. 

  I feel like a loser. People warned me not to make the very mistakes that I’ve made, and here I am haha. And yet, no amount of grim humor can alleviate the soul-crushing feeling of realizing that you have self-sabotaged yourself and thus made yourself inferior in character to others. The chickens have come home to roost for me, it feels. 

  But then again, I could be acting over dramatic. People have told me that what happens in high school isn’t really a big deal, but how can I believe that? Rambling aside, I admit that I’m not sure what to tell. Even if I get my act together now, it feels like it’s ultimately a lost cause. 

  The reason that I write this, is because I think I *need* to have a dialogue with someone who knows. Someone who can relate. Someone who is wise. I don’t know anyone who I feel is truly wise; anyone that I admire in that sense (not anyone that I can talk to anyway). So, there it is - my dilemma.

(Also, looking at this post now, it feels like a crazy person wrote it. Sorry.)",11Dec2017,3
17,"Long story short, I cut both flexor tendons in one of my finger about a year ago. I had to get surgery and months of occupational therapy to regain most of the strength and flexibility I used to have. It's good enough, because I can do the things I used to do and it doesn't hurt too much most of the time. But it's a huge source of sadness in my life because it's changed my life in so many small ways that other people would brush off but I just can't seem to...and I can't talk to anyone about it because they wouldn't get why it matters.

I've had plenty of other injuries before (broken bones I didn't know about until months later, concussions, plenty of bruises and scrapes and sprains), but they were always things that would heal and I could forget about them eventually. With this, it's the kind of thing I'll always be aware of until the day I die...or have something more major and long-lasting happen, I suppose. I can always feel it, there's scar tissue that's built up, it doesn't bend as much or straighten as much as my other fingers, it feels stiffer/slower/less precise/clumsier than my other fingers, I don't have as much sensation because I damaged a nerve when I injured it. When it gets cold it aches, and sometimes it aches for no reason. It's fatter than my other pinky because of the scar tissue. And when I hurt myself, I had to take months off of one of the only athletic things I've enjoyed the past few years - when I came back, I was much worse than I was before the injury and even though I've been back to training for months I get pains that I shouldn't and I'm not back to where I used to be. I feel I never will be as good as I once was.

I don't know how to get past this. While this doesn't seem like a big thing, there's a lot of issues I'm dealing with in my life that are causing me trouble, and this is one of the things that feels like it's so silly I should be done with it already but I can't seem to shake it. I just want to get something off my plate.",11Dec2017,2
18,"So I work at an office with mostly girls from a higher class,and my social status is pretty much similar to theirs,but there is just one annoying girl who flaunt her wealth and it makes me feel...well...
depressed.She flaunts how her parents bought her a fancy house,she rides an 2017 Audi and so is her teen brother (he literally even picked a color).Their *permanent* house was in the richest place ever.
All the girl in the office call her rich.Even our boss is getting all excited of her possessions,which are technically her parents.
Who wouldn’t want to be rich,honestly?
I once was happy with my own car and house,but now I’m not sure.It’s as if the whole office put a neon sign saying ‘Look at __ she’s rich!’ 
If kind of makes me depressed a little.She was born into that wealth.

Jealousy? skepticism? existential crisis? annoyance?
Not to mention most girls in our office are vain and have a toxic energy/aura aboht them.It just makes me feel things.

19,"Obligatory throw away account

I have PTSD and TBI from military service.  Medically retired 3 years ago.  

The problem is that I’m not able to have a job and I have no idea what to do with...anything.

I used to work on drones, I’d rather put a bullet in my head than do anything relating by to them.  

I tried taking classes but failed out of 3 of them...which sucks because I had nothing but As in the first half of 2012, everything went to shit that fall.
There’s no way I could become a teacher at this point.  I don’t see how.

25,"I'm in my 30's and I've spent most of my life getting used to a certain lack of doing. In high school, sure I went, but I was half asleep during my early classes, couldn't wait to get home, and sometimes dozed off on the couch before dinner. Homework and studying was never a huge thing. I got away with it because I'm smart, but by 11th grade it had devolved into doing 1st period homework in homeroom, 2nd period work in 1st period, etc. and studying for tests the period before too.

My SATs were good and I got into a good college, but flunked out, which is what happens when you don't go to class. I went for an associates degree, then a few years later got the bachelor's, and my GPA was decent, but again, I did it without huge amounts of effort, and barely worked while doing the degree.

For work, I teach music, math, and SAT prep independently. I'm good at it, it's easy for me, and the hourly rate allows me to sustain myself (barely) on not major hours. In between I've constantly tried to psyche myself into practicing music 8 hours a day, starting some project I'd have in my head, and a few other things, but I never really did. It's always been simply not enough time or effort.

So, like today, what did I do? I woke up around noon, took an hour getting ready, went out to teach, grabbed dinner, came home at 5:30, ate in front of the TV for an hour, and then sat at my PC...until now. It's now 12:45AM. No games, just browsing reddit news sites and youtube, and thinking and going places in my head. I can burn through free time like this and look up and 6 hours is gone. I might do some laundry soon, but this is my day to day.

Last year I tried adding a 40-hour day job to things, and it was a nightmare and a disaster. I felt like it took up ALL my time, I was having PTSD from high school of being stuck at a desk while minutes crept by, and I couldn't keep my eyes open.

I dream, and really, have some super-ambitious NEED to achieve big things in life, but the actual day to day reflects this not at all.
I want to learn programming, but what do I actually do? I watch an hour of video, do 15 minutes fiddling with code, and then after a few days of that I get bored of it and stop for a while. Pattern repeats. THIS IS NOT GOOD. I have a gym habit going, but if I do gym AND my work I come home and crash like the day is done, when really I need to be doing way more than that.



I really don't know how to fix this. I fear a certain set in my ways has worn in, and I might be doomed. I'd appreciate any advice anyone could share.",11Dec2017,2

Almost 5 years ago the mother of my child left me. While I'm completely over it, I was left with some really nasty depression (not quite suicidal) that I've never really been able to shake. Coupled with my existing anxiety and shyness around new people..well I don't get out much, if at all.
  
Shortly after the breakup I get a new job and actually manage to make a couple good friends. One of them had a girlfriend (Sarah, for the sake of anonymity). Beautiful woman, smart, funny, amazing cook, the works. But she's my buddies girl so I immediately rule out anything outside of a friendship with her. And we really did become good friends. 
  
About 8 months ago, they breakup. He moves back to his hometown and breaks off all contact with everyone. Well fuck, so much for that friendship. My other buddy and I make sure Sarah knows we weren't just friends with her because of him and to let us know if she ever needs anything. I lose touch with her, mostly due to work, until a month ago. Text out of the blue, asking how I'm doing. We start hanging out and it's great. It was the happiest I've been in a long time. And sure enough, I realize I'm starting to have some pretty serious feelings for her. She's everything I could want in a woman. So screw it, I ask her out on a date and she says yes. Fuck yeah, right? 
  
Date comes and it goes great, ends with a kiss and I'm on cloud 9. I honestly thought this could go somewhere. Obviously it didn't , or I wouldn't be posting. So I text her the next day (today, fuck the whole "" wait 2 days"" bs) and get nothing back until I'm about to go to bed. 
  
"" Sorry I've been really busy today. I had a great time last night and I really enjoy your company but as friends""
  
Fuck. Me.  
    
I ask why she agreed to a date if that was the case and she says she wanted to give it a chance and see what happened.
  
I had my hopes so high and they've just come crashing down around me. I can feel a crushing weight in my chest. I'm fucking heartbroken over a relationship that never even happened. I just can't understand. I'm a 27 and I feel like a damn child right now. I don't know what to do with myself. An adult would move on, right? I mean, she was never my girlfriend. It was one date. But now I feel like I've not only lost my best shot at being happy again, but I've also lost one of the only friends I have. I couldn't just leave well enough alone and I fucked it all up.

38,"I couldn't find a subreddit to post this question so I am trying here. I would appreciate if you give me some keywords to research about, ideas or suggestions. I understand anything you may or may not say are not to be taken as a medical or any sort of binding advice. PS. English is not my native language.

TLDR: I feel sad. I know what can make me feel joy after I do them (things like cleaning, organizing, talking to family, shopping) based on experience. But I don't do them. Why is that? How can I do the things that can give me joy?

Details: I have not been feeling emotions generally except I sometimes feel emotions intensely. I discovered last week that I have been suppressing my emotions for most of my life. I've read few dozen articles and seems like it effected every part of my life, and it seem to explain a lot about myself. [These](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18KNpTc2X356lv94jV7Oa98zGjH2VJ7Kz-JMoMoOyVVU/edit?usp=sharing) quotes from articles that are related to me. I might have emotional childhood trauma as well from parents fighting, and being treated as an extension of parents instead of individual, and lacking validation from parents about my basic abilities. I have almost no friends, I avoid intimacy, I probably feel alone, I don't know who I am among others, I don't know what I want, I have nothing to say. This is the case for a long time. I have always followed what others said. God, education system, parents, people I thought who knew what is there to know. Several years ago, I quit following and my life has been getting worse due to me not going after anything. I had some savings which enabled me to afford to not get a job to pay the bills. I am now 24. Finished college, without learning anything permanent, without getting an ounce of 'college experience'. According to a sibling, I started to be sad when I was like 10 years old. My childhood pictures are happy. Then I avoided getting pictures. When I am around others, I fake some of my positive emotions. 

I have read about descriptions of emotions and I am trying to imagine and feel them. I am journaling that I have proof that I can trust in my abilities. But like, it is all the same thing more or less. It doesn't lead anywhere. In my natural state, as far as I can tell/guess, I feel mostly sad, mixed with grief, anger, guilt, anxiety. I don't do anything that will make me feel joy. For example if I spend 15 minutes to clean my room right now, I know I will feel joy afterwards. But I don't do it. Maybe sadness became a part of me. 

I know I am doing life wrong and if I get 3 of these things, I will probably be as willingly functional as a healthy person: intimate relationship, friends, routine/job, physical exercise, leisure activities that i like. I have no routine, no friends, no job, no physical activity, no drugs/alcohol usage (cuz i start, i'll prob end up bad), no hobbies (tried somethings but nothing sticked). I know there is little chance I can be healthy like this because I learned it from a psychologist. But I don't even do something that will give me joy (except fast internet usage, food, porn). I also eat a lot with exception days, and consume more than normal amount of sugar. ",11Dec2017,7
39,"A little background first : I am 21 years old, I had (still have) possesive/negativist parents, didn't live my childhood as any other normal child (used to watch tv and play games the entire day without hanging out with other children), bullied when I was a teenager, only had 2 crushes who broke my heart a few years ago.

Last year I got my first gf who broke up with me because we haven't seen each other in 3 months. 2 months since the breakup.

Also, my parents never taught me anything about sex, my father never taught me how to shave and stuff. 

I'm still a virgin and I only kissed a girl. This is really bothering me because I feel like I didn't live my life the way I should have. I'm very frustrated because I want a gf, I want to have sex...

I have started doing some things to try to improve myself : I started eating more and healthier (I weigh 54kg), I started exercising before breakfast and before dinner, I started NOFAP about a week ago (no porn, no masturbation at all). Now I do feel like I have more energy, and it seems I'm a litlle more confident. Oh, and I got some new clothes and shoes, new haircuta. 
I also made an appointment to see a specialist (psychiatrist) to solve my issues.

*A few days ago I almost cried in train because in front of me there was a couple and they were kissing and hugging and stuff...and I felt so lonely, envioes, ashamed, abandoned...

Now I want to ask you something.
How do you even get to meet someone? To like them? To estabilish a connection which is going to lead to a relationship? It all seems so difficult to me. People seem so cold these days. It feels like if I'm going to approach a girl, she is going to turn me down and stuff.

I also tried to talk to a girl at University, but she only responds with one word, or simple answers. If I'm going to talk to her more, is there a chance she is going to...I don't know...change? What do you think?

Please, I'm looking for some answers for a long time. And I want to become a better person.

TL;DR :21 yr old, fucked up childhood, virgin, trying to become a better person. See these questions : How do you even get to meet someone? To like them? To estabilish a connection which is going to lead to a relationship?

41,"Put simply, even though I still live with my folks I live for myself. Doubt they'll help with goals I have or find an answer to my life's problems of late. So I'm not close &amp; even chatting to them feels like a chore. My life is hidden as I'm paranoid that they're manipulating me. Probably not but I can feel judgement in a lot of my actions.

So I'm lonely. People I actually want to be around in my life aren't there, and trying to find some people I find draining at times. I *know* a lot of people through work &amp; sport but I've never had any deep relationships with anyone. What does it feel like? At large gatherings I feel alienated - even when familiar faces are there.

I have tried a psychologist but most of the time it was just a chance to vent for an hour. It kind of worked, I felt pretty chill afterwards but the effects don't last as long as I hope. Even on a mental health plan they're not that affordable. ",11Dec2017,2

48,"I'm a 22 year old female, I work hard, I keep in shape, I'm kind, people say I'm good looking (my confidence isn't the best so I don't believe that), my biggest passions are animals and caring for others. That's why I went into the nursing route

My childhood led me into many problems growing up I was abused n stuff by my mum but I tend to try forget It, I was bullied and told guys are only after sex with me, I live with controlling family members but I'm moving out next year. Basically my life was a mess, my family still are. It's caused me deep problems when it comes to dating. First ever relationship from the age of 15 to 19, we were serious and he was my first love and boyfriend. Thought I'd be with him forever, nearly had a baby.

He was abusive, physically and emotionally Although I think my vulnerabilities caused It, he knocked my teeth out and beat me. It ended and my whole world came crashing down because for me it was my life for four years Obviously I knew it was abusive but that was all I knew from a young age.

I went off the rails, drank a lot and tried the dating game, whilst that was happening I came across someone I had a strong connection with and it told me I had to sleep with him because that's all I'm good for, he liked me even after it We didn't speak for a year and we got together after crossing paths again, we fell for each other pretty quickly but his career got in the way, he also pursued other woman, so it came crashing down.

Been single ever since and been on a few dates but nothing ever came of it.

Here's my problem I finally met someone I had good chemistry with

He pursued me, was never away from me, he would pick me up and take me on dates. Always wanted to see me, told me he really liked me and I felt he did.

Something happened to make me doubt myself(in my own life) and it went downhill. I made myself sleep with him too quickly, started discussing exclusivity (he said he wasnt ready for commitment) he made it out like he wanted it because he was complaining about guys talking to me and stuff and how he doesn't like it. I started pushing him away and talking less to him Maybe because I got attached, and I felt he didn't feel the same This happened so quickly

But now it looks as though it's ruined.

My relationships only last 3 months and they seem to get bored or leave quickly. I'm 22 so I've plenty of time to meet the right person but how can I not scare them off and just have a normal loving relationship

(Also getting counselling for the trauma I experienced as a kid)

52,"I used to feel that I was really ugly dude. I used to think I was so ugly that no will girl would ever like me. I was fat, covered in zits, yellow teeth, like it was bad. I would post my picture of things like r/amiugly thinking people would tell me I'm not as bad as I thought, then people say I look worse than I thought I did. I used to look in the mirror and look away because I saw the truth in front of me. Especially when I was naked, I really hated how I looked naked. This was about a year and a half ago.

I just got out of the shower a little while ago, and I was looking at myself in the mirror, thinking wow I've turned into a real good looking guy. I started off by losing 115 pounds. Went from obese to healthy weight. Went from fat hanging out everywhere to a 6 pack trying to poke through my stomach. I see my chest has built some muscle, I finally did away with the ""man tits"" and am starting to get the big upper body look. I finally gave up smoking and my teeth have whitened. I went to the dermatologist about 6 months ago and got put on a prescription cream and an antibiotic. It's still a work in progress but oh my god it looks so much better. I finally stopped having girls tell me what to do with my hair, and I grew it out to about shoulder length and styled it in a way that fits me. I get complimented for it all the time at my cashier job. It feels really nice being able to look into the mirror with confidence.",11Dec2017,253
53,"I have a broken relationship with my mother, it’s usually not very good. Today she is over at my house and getting along with everyone, which is not very normal, and we had our first properly nice discussion since... well... so long ago that I can’t even remember.

She decided to give me a reminder that I have real worth in the world, and that she respects me, and that is not something that I ever thought I’d hear from her.

And I heard it today.

And I’ll probably never hear it again.

But I’ll remember it for the rest of my life.",11Dec2017,3
54,"So I was debating on posting this but the post depression of the event and feeling like total shit has got to me. So yestserday I was using the service road of a highway and was going 60 (in a 55) through a green lit intersection. Some blue honda odyssey cut the person off in the left lane and decided to stay in mine. So im going 60 and this person is barely going 20, and not seeing the people to the left i tried to get over and they honked to let me know they were there so my only other option was to brake. The van also breaked and I had to slam on mine which led me to spinning out and sliding off the road and into the side of the highway. The car almost tipped over and slammed into the wall but luckily it didnt, it just slammed into the wall soun around again and hit the wall for the 2nd time and finally stopped.

Everyone on the road slowed down and thankfully 2 other cars stopped to help me one including a nurse. The blue van who cut us off fled the scene. All I thought was its done and Im not standing up out of the car, but I was surprised when i didnt have a scratch on me. I almost broke down crying in her arms because i was so scared. The cops said they were going to check the cams for the van since nobody got his plates and were putting him at blame for the accident and my evasion as the cause of the accident.

That car is done for and I thought I was too but thankfully mike and pam who stopped to help me and the other person.

58,"I've worked in IT from the age of 19, deadset on building a career in that field. I spent time working and going to school full-time throughout my 20's not giving myself much room for learning new things and growing as an individual. 

I can't say it's been the happiest of journeys, or that fulfilling really.

An opportunity recently presented itself in the form of teaching people how to do something that I've become fairly passionate about; Snowboarding. This past weekend I spent two full days on the snow with a few people and a snowboarding legend, learning how to teach the sport and kinda getting some personal lessons as well. I met some wonderfully awesome new people and gained experience seeing a different side of the snowsports industry.

Today I walk back into my dayjob riding the wave of good vibes from the weekend and the feeling starts to hit me that I really don't care about working in IT. Tired of the people, tired of the same 'ol problems, and toxic management. No wonder I've been unhappy, I don't enjoy much of my job -in fact I find it kinda boring-. I don't think I'll spend many more years working in IT unless I find a really good reason to stay (like find a better place to work or whatever).

I just wanna play and teach others how to as well... My heart thrives in the powdery white snow covered hills. It feeds my soul.",11Dec2017,1

62,"I might ramble. I apologize beforehand. 

My husband and I started dating at 16/17. I was a year above him in school. We had been together in highschool about a year and a half. When I graduated hs, I was nervous because we weren't going to be spending all day in school together. In the summer he started working at a fast food place. He broke up with me. We were each other's first for practically everything I was devasted and heartbroken .he broke up with me with someone he worked with. 

From that point on, we were on and off. When we were off, he was always with that one chick. No idea why I stuck around. But I did. 

He graduated hs and shipped out to boot camp a month later. He had me write him and I would ask him what we were. We were off when he left. He said he didn't know. I told him I wasn't gonna write anymore and he begged me not to stop since I was the only one writing to him (not including family). For 4 months I waited for him. He came home and he didn't call me for two weeks. He finally came around on my bday. The next two weeks we were inseperable. But alas, he left after his recruiter assistant thing was up. 

He was in another state for school. It was hard. We didn't last. Fast forward to me being tired of playing on and off again and felt by being with someone else, he would leave me alone. I had a baby with someone else. It worked. He left me alone for a year and a half but then we got back together. We got married after not talking all that time. He said he loved me. He said he couldn't be without me. 

While I've been with him, him being with that other girl bothers me. I think because he broke my heart for her. Turns out he had her writing him too while in boot camp. It bothers me a little. Even after almost 10 years. 

Today it came up and I don't even remember why. I then asked him if he slept with her or not. Do I need to know? (We don't talk about who we've slept with and all that. No idea why) he looked straight in my eyes and said no. But he did that too when I asked him after boot camp if I was really the only one who wrote him. But like my thing is why me. Why did he pick me? Like I don't know how to feel about this. I dont know why after 7 years of being married, this is still bothering me. He says that he doesn't feel this way towards my oldest daughters father. But I never left him for someone else. I met him while he had left me for that other girl.

I don't have trust issues. He's never done anything for me to question him. We have a rock solid marriage. I just don't get why I can't let this go. 

Edit. While we were off, I talked to other people. But it was never the same person and I never got serious with them because I knew him and I would get back together. ",11Dec2017,1

She can't see how dirty the towels get. I clean my own and she blames me for keeping towels from her (she has three, plus a bathrobe??!) cause  apparently responsible for the bathroom and therefore I should clean everything.
I try to keep things organized by telling her to put cutlery and such in the right drawers and she calls me insane.
I yell only when necessary. I don't do it for fun cause I do it because I'm mad at her for not understanding easy tasks! Or remembering when I have friends over even when I've written it down and texted her!
If I don't yell and talk normal she tells me I have an attitude. I can't win. I'm not allowed to win because if she doesn't get her way she calls our parents who threaten to make me take the train from theirs to the city where I go to uni.
I can't be too much of a pushover. It's crazy how much I actually love being in charge of something like my own house right? I can't believe these things still happen!!!

71,I'm developing a community outreach and inclusion program for our city's annual pride event - which despite what it is has never had any sort of program or coordinator before. I'm looking for advice on how to lay the initial ground rules for the role and set up processes that can be used this year and for the years to come. There is a lot of tension between different groups within the LGBT community and pride and I am hoping to create a program that can unify everyone so that everyone can participate and enjoy the event.

76,"I’m a student at UC Berkeley, where students are ostensibly proud of their “Work Hard, Play Hard” mentality. After being here for a few years, I'm not sure whether that pride is much more than a lie we tell ourselves because we need to think we love it in order to get through it all.

I look around at my friends, as we go into finals week, and their sunken-in eyes, pale skin, and nervous ticks express a whole range of emotions, none of them that I would describe as “prideful” or anything positive. 

I find catharsis after a 14 hour study session by relating to my fellow peers in how our amphetamine dependencies and daily withdrawals affect us — it’s reassuring to know that everyone else I know wakes up in a cold sweat a dozen times per night too, only to wake up and stuff our faces before our adderall binge sessions leave us with no desire to eat and with the ability to study all day without needing a break. 

We love that we can intersperse these miserable study sessions with our weekly binge-drinking sessions, jogging back from Moffitt library at 10pm when it closes each Friday so that we don’t miss taking ten shots with our friends and going out to party. After all, this fun isn’t a choice; if I, and many others I know, didn’t have this fun every Friday from 10pm-1:30am and every Saturday at the same time (except game days, when the drinking starts at 9am, and you study afterwards, when you’re hung over) then we would all collapse under the immense stress of work and lack of release. 

“Work hard, play hard” sounds wonderful as this oft-romanticized concept: you get the most out of your life, maximizing your fun and maximizing your knowledge intake.

Well, it’s not that that’s not the case; I do learn more in a semester here than I could imagine learning anywhere else. When I graduate with my degree in Computer Science and a minor in Logic, with a specialization in figuring out the most logical way to maximize my adderall intake without destroying my body, I’ll be more than prepared to go into the real world and work.

I also don’t know if I’ll want to. 

Students here are tired. I’m tired. This system doesn’t work, and there has to be a better way. I’m barely keeping my head above the water to try to maintain my 3.95 and everyone else I know who wants A’s is doing the same — at some point, is it not worth it to just stop with the unnecessary grade deflation? Harvard doesn’t do this bullshit, and you can see in statistics that their students are way happier and more successful than here. 

Kids I know at other schools with similar mentalities are in the same boat. No one likes this system and no one benefits from it, besides maybe the pharmaceutical companies and the psychiatrists near schools that can perscribe this legal meth as a study drug. 

Our lower GPAs and higher drug tolerances don’t make us more hireable. 

They don’t make us more qualified for grad school. 

They just fuck us up.
