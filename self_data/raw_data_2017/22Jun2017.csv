1,"I went to a private school. Recently, I've found a part-time in a region with not that many affluent people. I work at a dance center. 

When I was there, I bumped into two girls who go to the same school that I went to. It wasn't long before I realized that many of my coworkers put them on a pedestal (they are wealthier than I am). I can understand why everyone else is doing that (given how there is a big wealth gap), but I can't help but feel a bit uncomfortable. I just see it as part of my upbringing and the kids as my peers yet so many people at my workplace seem to be putting them on a pedestal. Some people developed the same fascination with me when they discovered that I went to the same school as them.",22Jun2017,2
3,"Hi Reddit
I am a third year RN working in a large teaching hospital in a big city. The unit I work in almost exclusively takes patients with an acute form of leukaemia or lymphoma, who are receiving aggressive chemotherapy +/- bone marrow transplants. Lots of these patients die as a result of the disease or from complications in their treatment.  

It is a stressful environment, and my specialty area is notorious for high turnover and burnout. This in turn puts more pressure on remaining staff to pick up the slack while new staff are brought up to speed. 

Earlier this year, I was involved in a major incident, where I was the first on the scene and had to give CPR to an elderly woman who I found unresponsive and in respiratory arrest. She had fallen and smacked her head on a porcelain sink in her room. 

Since then, Iâ€™ve been having a hard time managing the stress of the job. I thought I needed a holiday, but I am going back to work today after 4 weeks off, and I am nearly in tears. 

I want to know, how do you manage the demands of a job like this? At the moment, I feel like I canâ€™t continue, but I donâ€™t want to start all over again somewhere new. 
Any advice on managing stress or even stories about successful transitions into other areas of practice would be appreciated.
 
Thanks

15,"I HATE IT. Especially the sound of telephone. It's annoying. Why not text instead?

Whenever someone calls it would just leave me in a bad mood until the evening. The problem is, I get a call EVERY FREAKING DAY. My family, my work, etc. These days instead of just texting my sister would just call to ask how's everything at the house and what we have for dinner. My mom would sometimes call too to ask if I did something etc. The lady that I am working with would call me everyday these days. I temporarily stopped there working 2 months ago. I told her that I would be on a vacation so she can't expect a call from me but she still calls. I even told her that I would just text her when I am already available but no, SHE STILL CALLS. Sometimes they would just call me on the most nonsensical things.

I am not a social person. I could live a decade without going outside. I also have my days scheduled that is why I hate it when someone would just call me in the middle of my study. I just recently had a major change in my life so I am busier than ever. I had a big project that I worked in for almost 2 months. I worked for it day and night. I would sleep at irregular hours. The day it was over I was freaking relieved, thinking that I could already have my rest. I almost lashed out at my sister when she called me at the middle of my sleep.

I learned my lesson, so I refuse to give my number to my friends or any new acquaintances. I get angry when they try to call me on through fb sometimes, but I could live with that. Could just make myself offline or turn off the wifi. I would like to remove the telephone, but my family would not like that. My family already hates me for being so disconnected.

Sometimes I think they just call me to avoid the stress of the work life for a while. My sister called me one time, told me she was on the bathroom stalling for time.

What I hate is that they would tell me things like, ""What's the use of your phone?"", ""You are just at home right? You aren't doing important.""

Am I too petty? Too antisocial? Maybe. This is hell for me. I just want to do things alone. I want to be alone. If I want to talk to someone I would message them, and I won't expect a reply. They could reply as long as they want to, or maybe not at all.

Sometimes I feel guilty. Some people aren't as antisocial as me. Maybe I am the one who is annoying on their perspective. But.. God. I just don't know how to deal with this! I just want to have peace, that is all.

17,"I come home from work, and the first thing my wife says is, ""Let's go to Soi Cowboy."" I play Coy Cowboy and ask, ""What's that?"" She explains that she wants to see what the hooker scene is all about. Okay. Damn, do I love this woman.  

It was a spectacle, I will say, but sort of in a sad way. I don't mean morally sad. I don't ride high horses. It was sad to me because it seemed grossly inefficient in a capitalist sense. The supply so severely outweighed the demand, I was mostly concerned for the Thai businessmen and women. All this choice is good for the buyer, though, so maybe I should just be happy for these middle aged, chubby white men. Also, I'm surely missing something because this street has been thriving since well before I was born.  

We drank cheap beer. We laughed at the clearly lost family of four, including a wide-eyed 11 year old who probably started and completed puberty that night. We smiled at the beautiful men and women who kept their distance from me, presumably because of my wife's presence.  

But the highlight of the red light district wasn't the ladies or the lady boys. There was this oppressive perfume smell in the air, and we couldn't figure out what it was. Finally, I realized it reminded me of my great grandma. ""Mothballs!"" my wife yelled. Yes. The whole place unexplainably smelled like mothballs. Several beers later I go to the bathroom in some seedy place, which I'm literally sharing with two women, and what do I see in the urinal? A huge pile of mothballs. Budget odor control comes with the added bonus of all the hookers reminding you of Gram.",22Jun2017,2
18,"I was put in special ed because a couldn't read well in primary school when I was about 7yr (but could somehow write). Turns out the teachers were just shit and didn't bother teaching in any way other the bare minimum necessary. My mum taught me to read in about 2 months &amp; got me a student tutor. I went from the bottom of the class to top quarter in a year.

Did well in high school and sixth form but alas depression sucks and I should have waited a bit before going to university :(. Though weirdly after dropping out and the world NOT coming to an end I feel more positive than ever, even have a plan to study a subject am both good at AND enjoy, rather just what I *thought* I would enjoy.

19,"My optometrist is a past middle aged, not quite elderly asian gentleman. He has had this office since my first visit to this city and will have it after I'm gone. After a pleasant conversation the receptionist he calls me into his office. Typically dimmly lit room with a chair that looks like it removes eyes rather than check health. He instructs me to sit down.

We go through standard medical requitsites. 'How is your general health... Are you allergic to any of these medications...When was the last time you were here?'

'Years ago... Are you the only doctor at this office?'

'Yes, I always have been' responding with a hint of akwardness and pride. We continued on with the exam for a short time. 'You know...' trailing off like an old man about to begin rambling, 'My family was dirt poor. We lived nearly pay check to pay check off east side the Mississippi River.' 

'Oh that's cool. Were you a river fishing kid?' 

'Oh, nonono' he responds. It's at this point I start picking up on his repressed accent. 'Too poor for that. Everyone I knew was a sharecropper.' Typical boring conversation tokens were exhanged before we continued with the exam. 

He picked up again after the first projector test. 'The interesting thing was...'  pausing to adjust the eye removal chair, 'we lived on the border of the racial lines. Blacks didn't like us, and niether did the whites' 

At this point I'm struggling to grasp the proper response to his statement, and I can only respond with a dumb 'That's terrible'

'It was bad.' He tells me snippets of prejudice he faced from both sides. He seemed intense about his former black friend 'You see he was a strong black kid, and as you can tell I wasn't a large boy myself. So he would ride my bike, and I'd ride on the studs in back. One day he tells me we can't be friends anymore.' Pausing and starting in his habitual fashion, 'I asked him why not and he responded with my family is part of the Nation of Islam now'

I listen intently now. Piecing together earlier tangents about Mohammed Ali and his distaste for politicians, realizing he has been leading up to this story for some time now. 'Oh *those* guys' I said with moderate distaste in my voice. 

He continued, but his voiced sounded different 'So here I am with someone who had experienced prejudice like I have. And they are putting it back on me.' Through all the filters, his professionalism, his decades on earth, his slight drawl, his voice sounded different. ' So I went over to my friends house and demanded an answer. I wasn't satisfied with what he had given days before. He told me again our people don't like eachother and that's why.' It was pain I was hearing. I heard a dulled but echoing pain through this entire part of the conversation. He paused again. 'Now why would he do a thing like that?'

I realized the question was not rhetorical. Keep in mind I'm a twenty-something that doesn't know his asshole from a hole in the ground 'What if it's just human nature to be against the other?' I am trying my absolute hardest to match to this man's earnestness. It's obvious he found my answer unsatisfactory. 

We kept talking for while he did the exam. Similar subjects; Is it the responsibility of the law to end racism, or the responsibility of the culture? The last guy was supposed to fix this and the doctor thinks it has gotten worse. This went on for the duration of the exam. He thanked me, I awkwardly thanked him back. 

The reason I typed this out was to just process the intimacy of the conversation with basically a complete stranger. I am glad it happened. I never really considered the race relations between any other groups than black and white.",22Jun2017,406

21,"I'm currently a music student at a state university. The program I'm in is good, but not one of the super elite schools people want to be in. My problem is I have the huge complex of ""I need to be the best trombone player in the school or else I'm nothing"" and I can't get that out of my head. Normally this would be a good goal for any musician, you want to be the best. Except I keep getting horribly discouraged on a daily basis, basically whenever someone else in the studio does something really well. It's horrible because I have a really good friend who's a year below me (I'm a junior and he's a sophomore) and there are times where I hate him and wish he would fail or quit or go away or something, just so I could be the best. It's really unhealthy and it makes me feel guilty every time he or anyone else does better than me at something. It also doesn't help that I'm behind my class in terms of age (I just turned 22 and most of my classmates are 19/20) it just makes me feel like a big loser overall. I get really upset at myself very easily and it hurts my drive to keep practicing and improving. It's a really unhealthy obsession and I don't know what I can do to help myself. I keep struggling with the ""do I buckle down and devote my life to getting as good at trombone as I can? Or do I give up on myself and just live in disappointment?"" Usually when I try really hard I get discouraged and end up giving up but I can't keep doing that. Maybe I should see a therapist about this but I don't know, this is just something that has been bothering me for the better part of a year. It also affected me to a degree when I was in high school too, kind of the same situation just less severe.",22Jun2017,3

26,"Kindness is not a commodity that can be bought or sold

It is given freely from one to another

It is not earned, nor is it owed, but it should be expected

Kindness is more powerful than anger, more fruitful than jealousy.

And you who take up a grudge, and you wear it on your sleeve,

and you leave it to fester and rot,

you have no kindness, since you are always plagued by your anger.

And you who would use kindness as a means to an end,

who would fool another by its way to produce your will,

you have no kindness, since you are a liar.

True kindness is fresh and new always, and

true kindness never feels wrong;

Since kindness is the child of love.",22Jun2017,0
28,"Before I became a mom, I had lots of hopes of living in Santa Barbara as an EMT, and eventually joining the Peace Corps or WWOOF . I've always wanted to travel and work small jobs to get by. I know that the relationship I am in, is amazing now. We had lots of downs and when I found out I was pregnant, it ruined me mentally. I stopped listening to music, working out and slumped for the past 2 years. 

Fast forward to today. I've been practicing Yoga for about a month and a half, no longer taking long naps and ready to take classes at a local college. My 15 month old son is loving and hilarious. He is filled with curiosity and has our humor. I'm in a better place now.

The universe, society, the fucked up world we live in, the true meaning of life, the afterlife... just anything and everything in between. I'm tired of the small talk bullshit, basically. There's much more that meets the eye and need to be talked about. There's so much out there... Yet to be discovered! It intrigues me and terrifies me. How do I not know these things exist?

38,"I'm almost 17 and I go to high school. I'm rather a mediocre student. I never put much effort into school, except the subjects I'm interested in. 

I befriended some of my classmates that also put as little effort as possible into school, just so they can pass. And i started to notice that I keep competing with them, like, who will have the best marks with the smallerst effort. 

I started to get a mad satisfaction from being better than them in the most subjects and we were making fun of each other, because someone really sucked at some subject, but we were obliged not to learn at home beyond school breaks, since it's like a challenge. 

I was fine with all of this, because I could feel like I was born the best. But then some more distant classmate, but still a good friend, who is also putting very low effort into school (he just keeps copying), but has far greater marks and abilities at maths and just manages to copy and cheat so good, that he has better marks than me. 

I became furious and confused. I kept talking with him how small of an effort I'm putting into x and getting rather good marks, but he always resonded with ""ok"" and carried on. 

Now, I know that I can become better at school if I study hard, but it would feel like a failure to me, like I am worse than someone and need to study something when the other person is fine with it. It would make me feel worse. I know noone is equal, but if I once started studying hard and getting good marks, it would not be impressive for me, since it isn't a sign of my intelligence. 

I know it all feels stupid, but I'm really confused and need a sound of advice.",22Jun2017,2
39,"I taught myself to do the 8-step baduanjin qigong movements and it has really helped me feel better and stronger. It's sort of like Tai Chi, but a bit more focused on healing, and much much older. Tai Chi is a derivation of qigong, in fact. I also have been doing workouts that I follow from videos of Shaolin masters. I really recommend people to just start doing these crazy stretches and start trying out high kicks, or stand on your head, or whatever you feel like you gotta do. I had all this pent up energy and didn't know where to channel it, but now I do. Just do it in the park, who cares who is watching.

41,"TLDR; I have quit doing hard drugs, smoking cigarettes, eating meat [vice? I'll let you decide], and now drinking all because of how it effected the people around me, not me directly.  I had not desire to quit these behaviors for myself and would not have if it were only effecting me.

I don't really hold any resentment but I do wonder if the fact that I am motivated by the well being of others more than my own health will lead to some resentment later in life.

I quit drugs when I decided to get engaged because my future bride had some self control issues and I was worried she would over do it.  I quit smoking so my wife would have an easier time when she was pregnant and breast feeding.  I never started up again so that our children wouldn't grow up having to smell that.  I stopped eating meat because my family decided that it was wrong.  Now I am quitting drinking because in addition to the health concerns [not mine but of me] I have teenagers and we fear there attitude towards drinking is effected by knowing that we do and we have decided that hiding it and lying about it would be wrong.

43,"At some point you just gotta accept that you're not worth much and ya had your run already. At this point it's just the struggle of accepting that I'm going to live a boring life of desperate, futile attempts at fleeting happiness and then I'll die alone, unmourned, and unremembered.

I got a degree for nothing because the only job I could land didn't need any degree at all and is on the wrong side of the country for me. And even they only took me because they took literally anyone - any job that actually required so much as a formal interview decided immediately afterwards I wasn't worth the time.

The few friends I've managed to cling onto have better things to do with their time and will inevitably drop me altogether, the few relationships I've had with girls I've tricked into having anything to do with me physically or romantically have not just failed but failed spectacularly. And these days the only girls even vaguely interested in me are roughly three times my weight and despite several optimistic attempts I can't seem to force my body to acknowledge that I need to lower my standards, so I can't even settle.


I couldn't even work up the nerve to off myself properly and have accepted I'm too much of a coward for it, and I can't even blame my failures on some external factor - I had shitty-ish parents, but not nearly so bad as it could have been, was middle to upper-middle class, did well in school, and despite definitely not being attractive enough to get by on it even I have to accept that I'm not so hideous that I can blame my social and romantic failings on anything other than my being a shitty waste of a human being. 

I don't know precisely what the point of posting this is other than to solidify it in my mind. Hope that by putting it out there, not just out there but on a public forum, I will have no choice but to finally acknowledge and accept that I'm going nowhere but down instead of pointlessly, foolishly pretending that I still have some potential at being happy. Or maybe I'm desperate for someone to tell me that's not at all true, but then you're really just enabling this pathetic, whiney behavior, aren't you? So I wouldn't recommend that.
