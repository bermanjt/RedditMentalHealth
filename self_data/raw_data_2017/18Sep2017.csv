0,"I'm 21 years old, my fourth year in college. I still have a few semesters left after this one. 

Anyway, it's my third year at my particular university. And I haven't made any friends. For some reason I just don't like most of the people I meet here. Some of them are alright people, but trying to interact with them feels very robotic and unnatural, and there's just no chemistry. A lot of people aren't interested in talking because they already have their friend groups sorted out. And obviously, some of them are just assholes. I feel very alone here, I've never really understood the college lingo or the social dynamics surrounding it and as a result I've been unsuccessful in making friends. I've also never had a girlfriend, or had sex. 

This past weekend I was hanging out some old friends of mine. The one is kind of nerdy, a little shy, not the type of person you would imagine getting laid all the time. Anyway, he spends a lot of time on his phone. I asked him what he was doing, and he showed me this huge conversation he was having with this super hot girl he met at his college. He also scrolled down through pages upon pages of sexually suggestive pictures she sent him, there were probably hundreds and they've only been talking for a couple of months. Apparently she also sends him nudes on snapchat. I asked him a few more questions about if they had sex or not and he casually says ""no. She wants to fuck, but she also wants a relationship"". And I just thought wow. This insanely hot girl actually WANTS to fuck my friend. He makes it sound like its so easy to get to that level. I felt such shame inside, knowing that I've never been successful in getting ANYWHERE with girls, let alone knowing a girl who sent me constant nudes and wanted to have sex with me. 

My other friend has kind of the same personality, not someone you would picture getting laid all the time, but he does. He was also texting/snapchatting this girl he had sex with last week. Both of my friends were helping each other with the girls they were texting, talking about having sex and getting laid, different types of girls they fucked, etc. I feel so awkward in these conversations, I never know what to say because I've never had sex. I usually just laugh a few times to look interested and like I know what I'm talking about, even though I don't. 

Whenever I hear about other people's sex lives, and how normal and commonplace they seem to be, it makes me feel like shit for never having any type of sexual experiences. A normal 21 year old male should have an active sex life, as literally every other 21 year old I know does. I can tell my friends feel so much better about themselves knowing they can get laid whenever they want. It makes them feel like a ""man"" whereas I feel like an incapable loser. I just feel like shit for not being able to make friends or get girls, especially when I see so many people who can do it so effortlessly. Is this normal? ",18Sep2017,14
1,"I used to be a bully, I was always one of the cooler kids in high school, and there were a handful of kids in our friend group or outside our friend group who we did not like. I can name them right now, David, Peter, Adam, Moe etc they were typically right at the fringe of our friend group and often we met them through friends of a friend. 

Right away, if they couldn't keep up with our lingo, if they were too weak or soft, if they tried too hard to hang out with us when we didn't want them, a sort of process started. It would always start with the group meeting at the local hangout spot in which someone mentions ""I don't really like that kid that much"" and someone else will say ""yeah! holy shit I thought I was the only one"" and then someone will say something mean possibly about them. After that initial moment, the floodgates open, and the dehumanization process begins. What was once an unsure positive now becomes a unified negative. Even if you liked that person, there will be enough negative talk there to convince yourself you don't. 

Then it starts, the ditching, the not meeting up with them, the subtle insults. And then there is always the one or two instigators who take it too far, who begin actually saying things to their face. It started with David when someone said they look like someone hit their face with a frying pan, then again when someone openly called them fat. And people wanted to step in, but nobody wanted to be the person that David relied on as a friend to defend themselves. It was all rooted in this sort of ""I dont know why I dont like them, i JUST DO"" that usually comes from that first conversation. 

It is a sense of dehumanization to them. You don't even see them as humans with emotion, and you can't resist laughing at their torment or bad fortune. Someone took davids bike and threw it over the lake, and he didnt even do shit? What a pussy, that is hilarious. Seriously, this is how we felt, even the 'good people' who were nice to 90% of people often went through the dehumanization process through their friends. 

Being a popular group means a lot of people you don't like will try to hang out with you guys, and you often have to put up that tough exterior to keep out people who you feel would emotionally snitch on you. The people who would be the ones to say ""thats fucked up, dont do that to them"" often aren't invited due to fears of exposing us. Not exposing us to other people, but to ourselves, making us feel bad. 

And the worst part was that we knew it was bad, but it was literally IMPOSSIBLE at a point to look at them and say something nice. It felt unnatural, it felt almost wrong. I remember in senior year I got grouped up with Peter, a kid we didn't like, and I had to be nice to him in front of the teacher and we both felt such embarrassment. It wasn't just trying to prove something to my friends, it was that it was literally impossible for us not to be mean, it felt cringey. 

I cant fully explain it, and obviously today I look back with disgust at how we treated people. I actually want to vomit right now thinking of some of the shit we did, and realizing the reasons were even worse. There is no justification, we all came from good homes, but we bullied and did horrible things to people who just wanted to be our friend. 

Its something I've been thinking about a lot because there are bullies at work who I can tell are leading up to do the same thing to me, and I am terrified. But at least I can identify that it is happening.

2,"So I've been at college for a year, and managed to make like no friends. It's a mix of me commuting there everyday instead of living there, and a lot of people being kind of full of themselves. It's a hard college to get into, so a lot of people there are really full of themselves and shit. Also being depressed makes it hard to just branch out and shit. I just do the bare minimum to get by.

But this girl I have a massive thing for is starting at the same college and it's kind of giving me a dilemma. For a start, she has a boyfriend, so it doesn't seem like anything is gonna happen. I tried to distance myself from her since she started dating, before that we were pretty flirty and talked all the time. I knew it would be hard to get over her without some distance. We work together though, although it's rare we have the same shifts. When we do though we're like always talking to each other non-stop. It sounds stupid, but being around her is one of the only things guaranteed to make me happy. I'm pretty damn depressed a lot, but being around her I kind of forget it for a little while. But I realise another person can't be the basis for your happiness, especially when your depressed and this person is in a relationship, so I don't want to get too close.

Anyway, soppy bullshit aside, today we were talking and she mentioned she was going to the same college now. She kept mentioning how she needed a friend there, and how she'd have so much free time over and over again. I knew exactly what she was hinting at but I tried to ignore it. I know if we hang out all the time I'm only gonna like her more. Then she just came out and asked if I'd hang out with her in between classes. Of course I said yes, cause she's still my friend. She suggested we go find somewhere to grab lunch and shit.

Now if she was single I'd take that as a massive hint. Like she kept mentioning it and she sounded really excited about it. But she has a boyfriend, so basically I'm just going for lunch with a girl who's already dating someone else. And who I have a massive thing for. All while I'm trying to distance myself. And it's not impossible that it becomes a regular thing. So what do I do here? I feel like shit not being able to be a good friend to her, but honestly being around her isn't good. The last thing I want to do is get in the way of her and her boyfriend. As much as I'm into her, that's just unfair.

**TL;DR:** Massively into this girl. She started dating some guy, but before that we were really flirty and talked all the time. Now not so much. However, she starts at my college soon and suggested we hang out in between classes and grab lunch together and shit. Should I keep distancing myself, or just try be her friend, even if it's hard for me?",18Sep2017,18
3,"This happens a lot of times with me, I get to know someone, become their best friend, and then when we fall apart I get afraid to try to get back with them.

Particularly right now, things fall out between a friend that I really care about. Part of me wants to just text her and say ""I miss you, we should hang out, I hope things aren't awkward between us that kinda stuff. But I just never have the courage to do it. I guess cause Im afraid of getting rejected and that the other person doesn't feel the same way?

Anyway just wanna get that out there

5,"Sometimes I question why I have been given more time on earth than others.  I've seen one of my friends pass away due to illness and one of my parents neighbors passed in a tragic accident.  My friend was ill all his life and I and everyone else was aware that he would have a short life.  My parents neighbor worked in landscaping and passed in a tragic accident where the mower flipped over on him and he was trapped under it.  

I know illness and accidents happen, but why am I given more time on earth than them or anyone else?  I work a couple part-time jobs and I'm working on my second college degree.  I'm just the same as my friend or parent's neighbor, but luckily I'm not ill or have had a tragic accident.  I guess it's a reminder to make the most of the time I have.  Smile at others and make someone's day when I can.",18Sep2017,9
7,"I don't know why I'm posting this, I just don't want him to be forgotten. Maybe because I now have the strength to post this.

He was my best friend, he helped me cope with depression and anxiety. I had a reason to leave the house. I had a reason to get up. 

We did everything together and then in may last year he began having seizures. The vet told me he was epileptic. My world crumbled. 

Looking back I think he had a tumor or something. He declined rapidly. Having up to 13 seizures a day, it was horrible. He was always present in my future plans, going sailing, to the ocean or the woods.

Non of this will ever happen again and it hurts like hell. By now people say I need to get over it, it's been a year! Why don't you get a new dog? 

Well I can't. It feels like cheating, a new dog could never live up to him. 

He was so beautiful, intelligent and happy.
Especially happy, although he was very ill he would always come for a cuddle, wagging his tail and kissing my earlobe.    

Here's a picture of him that I love

8,"I'm a new Reddit user and something happened to me this summer that I'd like to get off my chest. I can't even bring myself to tell a lot of people I know in real life but I want to just get it out there so I don't feel ashamed or scared by what happened to me. If I'm posting this in the wrong place please let me know!

A couple of months ago, I was waiting at a bus stop that's about a minute walk from my house. It's my go-to stop, and I've waited for buses there a million times. It's on a main street that's filled with cars during rush hour (I live in a large city). I was on my way downtown to grab dinner with a couple of girlfriends who I hadn't seen in a while. I had just graduated from university and started working full time so I was excited to treat myself with money from my first ""adult"" job. 

I was listening to a podcast and not really paying attention to my surroundings. Usually I don't do that because I don't want to be distracted when I'm by myself (I'm a girl and like many other girls when they're alone, take certain precautions), but it was 6:30pm and it was the middle of summer, so I let my guard down since it was still during the day. I was laughing at a joke made in the podcast when I felt something hit my leg. I looked down and I was bleeding profusely from the back of my left knee. I had honestly never seen this much blood in real life before. I was completely in shock and didn't know what to do. I looked around but there was no one around me to help so I called my dad. He got there right away since the bus stop was so close to where I live. I felt really numb as he called 911.

At the hospital, I got a lot of X-rays done, took antibiotics and talked to the cops. Basically, someone had shot me in the leg with a BB gun. Not one of those little pellet guns, but a gun that you can go hunting game with. The orthopaedic surgeon couldn't take the bullet out without compromising my knee since the bullet is wedged in a pretty nerve-y area. I carry around a letter now in my wallet that says I'm allowed to set off metal detectors.

A couple of weeks later, I spoke to the detective who was working my case and he delicately told me that they had nothing to go off of. There were no security cameras in the area, I didn't see the perpetrator, and there were no witnesses. The fucked up thing is that 2 hours after I got shot, another lady standing at the same bus stop got shot in the knee area too. The bullet grazed her and didn't cause too much damage, but I can imagine how scared she was.

To be honest, since I'm young, the healing process wasn't too bad for me. I limped around for quite a bit but my knee is basically back to normal now. What hasn't recovered is my brain. For 2 months after the incident, I refused to go outside by myself. I either had a friend or family member accompany me everywhere. I'm a lot better now and I'm fine going out and about by myself but I get random surges of panic if I feel sketched out in any way. I tell myself that there's no way I'll get shot again but I'm still scared.

13,"So I went to the local gym this afternoon, and on the way in, I see that somebody dropped their wallet. I could see that it had a good bit of money in it. Without even thinking, I took the wallet from where it was sitting just inside the door to the front desk and gave it to the lady working there, hoping that it would be returned. I thought that was that, until about an hour ago. I started thinking more about that money, and I feel like I'm kicking myself for not cleaning it out, even though it wasn't my wallet. I don't get why I'm dwelling on it even though I did the right thing by not taking the cash that was in it. I knew there was a decent amount of money in it because I could see the corners of a couple $100 bills sticking out of the corner. ",18Sep2017,2

You start to cheat on me and I try to do the same but I never get the chance. You start to drink just to be around me and you're always drunk when we fuck. Eventually you stay with me because you have too much invested. I'm afraid I'll never find love and you're the closest I'll ever get. Soon we're both about to move on in life and I'm afraid I'll lose you when you go to med school. I work up the courage to propose and you see it coming from a mile away.

You convince me to forego any wedding and we elope after about a year. I move with you and pick up a service job while you go to classes. We barely make rent even with your parents helping. We get pregnant and you say you want to get sober. You tell me we have to sleep in separate beds so the the baby can get its rest. It doesn't make sense but I go along with it.

The two of you get married. I get out and show up on you're doorstep. I seem drunk but I'm not. Steve gives me a ride back to my one room apartment. I cry in front of him. You calm our daughter down since I've scared her. I go back to work but I quickly get tired of cleaning toilets. A few weeks later I up my game and buy some rope. I hang myself.

I was very certain that if we ever met it would be very hard to hold back my feelings for him.
Now, that time has come, but I have a long term boyfriend of two years (I love him :-)). It isn't a huge deal, but I will always wonder what your voice, your accent sounds like, low whispers and laughs in my ear, wrapped in the covers with the sun shining through the window. ",18Sep2017,0

She was having a hard time understanding why her friend did what she did. My friend was confused, hurt, and searching for answers.

A dogfight is when one aeroplane tries to shoot down another aeroplane. Mostly WW1 and 2 stuff. Its not a dogfight if you fire a smart missile that seeks out and destroys the other plane while you have already turned back for home.

A dog fight is when one dog tries to bite, or otherwise attack another dog that retaliates.

Trying to get over the flu or other illness is NOT ""a fight"". Its another method of ""trying to survive"". ""Fighting off a cold"" does not involve overpowering an adversary.

I had to sink in my seat and listen to this nature guy yell at him that NO. ANIMALS GET EATEN IN NATURE. And if it didn't get eaten then the parents would return it to their nest. BUT NOW. THAT the bird was removed for like half a day cuz he wanted to post cool selfies and try to keep it as a pet, that it would be lucky if its parents were still even looking for it. So because my BF was listening to his emotions this bird was gonna die anyways now!! Most likely get eaten by a dumb cat instead of a natural bird predator and very unlikely that its parents were gonna even look for it now.

I was diagnosed with epilepsy at 18 (am in my mid 30s now). Had to stop working ""real jobs"" (jobs that come with payroll paychecks, benefits, etc., even part-time) in my mid 20s. 

To combat the lack of income I had, I started my own art business selling my paintings in 2008. I sold pieces to friends initially, then my sales grew to some businesses and companies across the US as well as donating pieces to charity organizations and fundraisers. While very cool getting my name out, these sales did not bring in enough money to get by. So I began selling in local art shows and got into a couple of galleries and have been selling that way regularly for the last 8ish years. 

This year I FINALLY hit my stride with sales! Though I do not paint as much as I used to I have absolutely found my jewelry design style and price points and have made more this year through show and gallery sales than I have in each previous year. I finally make enough money to help supplement my husband's income! 

This is 10000% huge for me. I feel like a human again, I contribute financially to our life again. My confidence has grown by leaps and bounds. This confidence has helped me start to get my seizures under control so I can apply for my dream seasonal job during my off-season for shows (I applied to work at a local ski resort--I even got an interview at the end of October!). I have also been able to get physically healthy as well, something I was having immense trouble with for years due to my seizures as well as depression and anxiety (which is clear in my posting history). 

All in all, I feel like I have a true future in my artwork, it's not just a hobby anymore. It took me years of hard work, more often than not putting 40+ hrs a week in at the studio, but I finally found my groove and am getting noticed for it. I feel like I could cry. 

Thank you for reading this if you got all the way through, I don't like to talk about this stuff on my FB wall because it seems too /r/iamverysmart or /r/humblebrag to me, so thank you for letting me boast a bit here. :)

37,Several years ago an exes dad took his own life. I couldn't help think how selfish it was to leave behind his own kids. I continued thinking that until I had a kid and started feeling suicidal myself. Your brain tricks you. It makes you think that your family is better off without you. I felt numb and life felt pointless. Luckily I got help. Suicide is not selfish. America needs to top stigmatizing mental health.  My awesome coworker who had two boys took his own life last night. He was a good man with many years ahead of him. Please reach out to those who seem off. If you need help please get it. I will gladly talk to anyone who needs to talk. You are not alone.,18Sep2017,2
38,"I have been going to the same family owned pharmacy for many, many years now. The service there is amazing and I am on a first name basis with the pharmacist and the tech. The pharmacist is one of the kindest people I know. She is always willing to go out of her way to help people out. She has even been known to give people discounts on things they need when she knows they can't afford it. One time a man came in and when she saw that he couldn't afford the $7 copay for his mental health pills, she gave it to him for free. 
   
Today I got a call from my insurance company (CVS Caremark), informing me that they will only cover my (very expensive) medication if I use a CVS pharmacy. I'm livid. Since when did they get to decide where I go to get my medicine? I can't believe this is legal. CVS Pharmacy isn't even a half-decent pharmacy. Every time I have been to one, it has taken days to fill my medicine and if there is a problem they are impossible to get through to. The worst part though, is that the family pharmacy is losing a lot of business this year because of this new policy. It's a blatant conflict of interest that CVS owns both a pharmacy and an insurance provider. It's scummy and corrupt and they aren't even trying to hide it.

39,I've got a mile and a half run in about 2 weeks time and need to get as ready as I can as fast as I can. It was sort of pushed on me really suddenly ,18Sep2017,0

42,I did 21 push ups today. ,18Sep2017,3
43,"ive been having a very rough both day and weekend. im in college and one of my friends offered to origionally invite me to a tailgate, but when i called him at the game he never answered his phone. i called and texted him a couple of times throughout but he still never answered. this isn't the first time he's done this to me and now im starting to doubt if hes a friend, or if i even have friends here.

then i had 2 exams today. in my one class before, i admit i screwed around a little in that class but still took my notes. the ta comes up to me after class and tells me ""get off of reddit, and netflix and everything else or im going to start marking you absent."" im flabbergasted because everyone slacks off in class, but  i felt it was targeting me and just unprofessional, but i don't know. I take my first exam and think i did ok on it. i get lunch and study for my second exam of the day. the second one was on a computer, and i end up with a fifty on the exam. i might need to drop the class.

I know im probably not being targeted but it just feels like it. I feel like no matter how much i do, im always going to get held down in some sort of way.

this has been a pretty shit month for me. does anybody have any advice? i know this might be the wrong subreddit, but i don't really know what to do.",18Sep2017,2
