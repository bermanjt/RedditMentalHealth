0,"I went for a workout class.  Im 38, overweight, and formerly in shape man.  

I went to a crossfit type class, and was easily the oldest person there by at least 5-8 years, with the class average seeming to be in the mid to late 20's.

I could barely keep up with the class, let alone the other people in it.  I used to be able to run 15 miles, do a dozen pull ups in a row, 50 push up and 100 sit ups without stopping.  Not anymore.  

I left that class feeling sorry for myself and like I was just better off giving up.  I have recently been though a few injuries, and found out that I have arthritis in my lower spine.  Nothing major but all things I need to take care of better.  By losing weight and getting stronger.

I decided that instead of giving in and giving up, I am going to start training properly again, and my goal is to run a full marathon when I hit 40.  I have plenty of time, but I need to start now.  I want to lose 40 -50 pounds (currently 218) by my 40th as well.

Not looking for pats on the back, or encouragement.  I wanted to put this out there for myself, and for those of us who feel that they have to give up and give in.  I am going to fight and push myself to be better, not because I want to impress others, but because I want to impress myself.",17Jan2017,10

We're going out now, but it feels like nothing has changed. We try holding hands and all, it feels awkward, and I really can't imagine us in bed and stuff. 


He's funny, and he makes me feel comfortable. But I'm not sure when it'll be before I'm madly(?) in love with him. I'm quite confused about how I should proceed now without fucking up. ",17Jan2017,5

9,"...the first few days were miserable. Splitting headaches for three days straight, getting suddenly sleepy, sick to my stomach. But,  now that I am past that, I feel so much better. My energy levels are even through the day, I sleep better, I am not nearly as hungry all the time.  My mind has cleared up, I can focus better. 

Of course I knew soda was terrible for me, but I hadn't realized just how dependent I had become on soda in order to feel ""normal"". It was a slow build to having three cans a day. Didn't help that they are free and readily available at my work. 

I wouldn't advise stopping cold turkey right when the school semester starts, but I'm glad I have stopped drinking soda. Best decision I've made recently.

11,"So my girlfriend's friend who I don't know well is having her birthday at this wine festival ($50 entry). I have zero desire to go but gf asked me to go with her so I told her I would. We each bought tickets. 

She knows I didn't really want to go , and told me I could extend the invitation to others. I did, and a friend of mine said she'd like to hang out with me and the gf and she also bought a ticket 

But now my gf found out there's a Womens March in out city at the same day and she feels convicted that she needs to go (the big one around innaguration day) 

Well that leaves me, who doesn't even want to go to this Wine event, having spent $50 I didn't want to spend and going with my friend who wanted to hang out as the 3 of us 

Obviously I support my gf and want her to go to this March. She feels bad about it, and says she's considering not going to the march (which she obviously wants to do) because she doesn't want to have put me in this position 

So basically. The only reason I was going was because I wanted to be nice to my gf. But now she doesn't even want to go. And it's not a huge deal except I've spent $50 i didn't want to spend in the first place 

I'm trying not to get upset with my gf because I know she feels strongly about the march. And even if she did skip it and do the Wine thing, deep down she wouldn't be happy (which is the whole  reason I agreed to go in the first place!) 

Anyway just looking for advice on what you would do in a situation like this ",17Jan2017,1
16,"Alright, we all know how hard a break-up is, especially when you still love them, but they don't love you anymore. I was in one of those relationships for almost six months. It was one of the best times of my life. I fell quickly, but when he left me, I was decimated. I hung around, like a stray dog, waiting and praying for him to take me back and love me again. I drove myself mad with the waiting, with trying to adjust who I was so that he would take me back, with trying to stop loving him, with trying to move on. We remained friends, with a few benefits on the side, and I kept stringing along, thinking after every time, he would feel the spark too, and take me back, but he never did. 

I did this for seven more months of my life, never considering other options. Never talking to anyone else. Never trying to move on. I would cry myself to sleep some nights, confused and alone and scared. For seven months of my life, I devoted almost all of my free time to trying to make myself lovable to someone who had hurt me so badly. My grades fell, my work performance fell, my mood fell, and my life fell. All the while, he makes posts about how horrible our relationship was, while saying to my face how great it was but that he just couldn't love me. It's taken me up til tonight to realize that if he would have taken me back, it wouldn't be now. Not after everything he's said So I sent him a message telling him I was moving on, and that's what I'm doing. 

You can't force someone to love you. You can't change yourself for someone who won't try to accept you for who you are. You can't waste your time on one person who won't give you the time of day, other than to use you for what they want. You can't change the past, and you can't change what happened. Accept it, spare yourself the heartache, and move on. It will hurt, like you're burning and drowning at the same time, but you will emerge a much better person for it. Don't waste your time on them. Spend your time on yourself.

Also if anyone would like to offer some advice for me or a few words of encouragement, it would be greatly appreciated

im 20 years old, have only worked at a few different places, recently had to quit my job at a skiing resort due to it being too labor intensive for me, even tho i used to play a TON of sports until i started gaining weight for what seemed like no reason (even tho i had a good diet and was still doing a ton of sports), now im overweight (235lbs) due to a thyroid problem (found out two months ago), which also makes it so my hair is thinning, a few months ago i biked like 6 to 10 miles a day for two months straight, i changed my diet completely (even tho it wasnt even that bad) and only lost like 5 pounds until i IMMEDIATELY gained that back for whatever fucking reason.. im half deaf in my left ear because i went to a super freaking loud concert a few years ago. my back is super fucked up and i have a hump due to sitting at my desk so freaking much.

i've been trying to grow a beard along with a friend of mine going on three months now and its gotten to the point where i enjoy having it but it just looks fucking terrible because i can only grow a neckbeard which i KNOW looks terrible despite my friends saying it looks good..

women are always kind to me and will talk to me but will never date me, on dating apps such as tinder and bumble i get nothing VERY unattractive women all the time which shows that i will never be able to find someone i am actually attracted to. which sucks because its basically all about my looks, im very kind, respectful and try my best to be fun and entertaining

i swear to christ i have a learning disability something, im great with computers, i try my best at music production, making youtube videos, i like entertaining people through comedy, i love learning about space and shit. but im absolutely horrible at anything that matters such a math, history and just general things you would learn at school, i was homeschool but my mother got super depressed and stopped teaching me and my siblings when i was like 10.. so any school education i have had stopped at age 10... i and everyone i know considers me/myself a very smart and a bright person but i have the education of a fucking 10 year old.. thats not TOO bad though because i love learning new things and have taught myself a lot about a ton of different things in my teen years. and im always looking for something new that interests me.

i live at home and cant even move out because of the job situation.. i love doing stuff with computers but i hate it as a career and cant stand doing it, i love doing music production but i feel i will never be great at it to make any money (same goes for my youtube channel).. i feel like i will never be good enough at anything to be able to live a good life.

i dont care if anybody sees this, i just want to get it out there and off my chest. i have no fucking idea what i am doing with my life... im depressed. not suicidal or anything.. i just have no idea what do to with myself at this point..",17Jan2017,2
21,"I'm an 18 year old female. I've had endometriosis since puberty, and for the most part, its only manifestation was excruciating cramps. Don't get me wrong, they sucked, but I would just use a heating pad and take some Tylenol. My doctor gave me birth control to treat it, and it helped, but the birth control caused too many adverse effects, so I stopped taking it. The cramps worsened and my endometriosis progressed. It has gotten to the point where having sex is extremely painful, so I went back to my doctor. They told me that my condition has likely done irreversible damage on my uterus. They said it is a very real possibility that sex will always be painful and, ironically, I may never be able to have children. I hadn't wanted children previously, but now knowing that it's not an option, I'm not sure how to feel. To be 18 and be unable to enjoy sex for, potentially, the rest of my life, is also a shock.

This past 2 weeks have been emotionally draining for me and to keep it short, I was seeing a guy, he went back to his ex but told me that he could see himself fall inlove with me but he can't give me 100% of him if his ex is still around so he has to see it through. So me, being the ""bigger person"" respected his decision and told him to go for it because if there was any hope for us in the future then he has to do this.

24,"I lay here awake at 2:30 am writing this because I've just had my life torn apart.  This is going to sound silly- I've lost two different 4 year relationships in the past, but today I lost a 4 month relationship that hurts worse than any pain I've ever felt in all my life.  Every day was perfect.  Comfortable.  Loving.  Happy.  She woke up next to me this morning and told me at least a hundred times today she loved me.  We were close.  We showered together.  She was intimate again with me.  We were making dinner and watching a TV show when all of a sudden a call is coming in from her ex boyfriend, who calls all the time like this- It's always ignored.  She always shows me the voicemails and texts on her own.  She ignores this call too, then gives me the longest 'I love you but I need to go' talk out of the blue.  Out of NOWHERE.  Promises she's going to stay at her mom's an hour away to think because she is confused.  However, her ex and her old apartment are 15 minutes away and she works nearby here.  

Back story- her ex was her first real boyfriend and they dated for 2 years before he started to become abusive.  I watched him slam a door on her and hit her head.  I've seen the things he has said to her, the voicemails, the texts, the names he called her.  He has threatened countless times with suing her about her lease.  He once chased me across the parking lot because I was helping her move her stuff out.  He's disgusting inside and out, does not keep himself or his apartment clean, doesn't seem to shower ever, and is overall just an awful person.  
I constantly had nightmares about him hurting her.  I would wake up, be calmly sleeping in her arms, and drift off back to sleep.  But it was almost daily.  

Tonight I was an absolute mess and my parents came and told me they would drive me to the ex's to see if she lied and went there to sleep.  Her car was there.  In the same day that she was intimate with me, and without showering again after- she's laying and sleeping next to him.  

I can't sleep.  I can't stop crying.  I'm a 28 year old fully grown male adult and I can't stop crying.  I've thrown up at least 15 times.  I laid and cried while my mom took care of me.  I loved this girl more than I have ever loved anything in all of my life.  I never, ever expected this.  It wouldn't have hurt if I saw it coming... But I never saw this coming.   She looked me deep in my eyes and kissed me before she left saying she just needed to regroup her life and that she was going to her parents to think.   I can't get her face out of my brain.  I feel so disgusted, so manipulated, so helpless. 

How do I make the pain stop?  How do I make this go away?   My first girlfriend like 8 years ago ended because she secretly was hooking up for a week with my best friend, who was also my cousin.  It hurt, but I got past it.  I felt like I could never trust again but I did.  I love my cousin so much still and I've completely gotten over it.  THIS, though.  This pain is so much worse than anything I've ever felt.  Just to see the genuine 'love' in her eyes as she kissed and hugged me goodbye, I wanted to believe her.  I believed she just needed time.    

I've never done this.  I've never posted my life or my story on the Internet for everyone to see.  But I don't know what to do.  I cannot stop crying.  My chest feels like it's collapsing and suffocating me.  I need help.  I'm sorry if I sound like I'm whining and rambling, but I'm in so much pain and I don't know what to do.   I know so many of you out there have faced much greater ordeals in your life- deaths, divorces, whatever.  I know.  It makes me feel even more weak and helpless.  My uncle died young suddenly last month before Christmas, and my cousins have been so brave and strong.   Their FATHER died, one of the best human beings I have ever known, yet they are still stronger in the face of loss than I am over this.  I don't know what to do.  I am completely helplessly lost.  I know I'm not alone, I know the world is full of pain and heartbreak.  But I'm in so much physical pain right now and I have never felt like this.  ",17Jan2017,1

38,"I feel like I've had a breakthrough here. Maybe it's obvious to all of you. But I've spent a long time in denial.

Why do something with my day when I can drink a few cans of Red Bull and get a buzz that way? Why do anything during the week when I just need to make it to Friday so I can go out and get drunk? Why put effort into my appearance and personality and getting my life together and meeting girls, when I can just jerk off to porn or some fucked up text conversation with someone I met on some shitty app? Why look for good new music, or learn to make it, when I can just smoke weed and any shit will sound fascinating?

These things, the reason I keep wanting to stop, is that they aren't real. They aren't the way the human brain evolved to be satisfied. Porn isn't sex. Reddit isn't social interaction. Junk food isn't healthy food. Alcohol isn't me having a good, interesting personality. Caffeine? Don't get me started. That's just flicking a switch in my brain to feel good, regardless of circumstances, regardless of whether I deserve it.

I'm cheating. I'm cheating at feeling good without working, without creating anything, without deserving it. I'm jumping straight to rewarding my brain without putting in any of the effort. And I've become a hollow, empty shell of a person. 

My teeth are rotting out of my face at age 27 because I neglected them for so long. I sleep on a mattress on the floor of my parents' spare room because I'm too lazy to get a job, and refuse to commit to anything.

I've filtered my friends down to a handful of people from high school who can tolerate my bullshit. I haven't made one new friend in over ten years. If that's not sad I don't know what is. One of them admitted today that I spent most of my life with a very abrasive personality and he's right. I'm insufferable. I complain about every minor thing. I make excuse after excuse for myself being so pathetic. Anything to avoid doing some work. I get furious with people when everything doesn't go perfectly my way.

I have no girlfriend because my life is a mess, and even before girls find that out, it doesn't matter because I can't hold their attention. Even when they approach me when I'm out, they're put off quickly by my boring, awkward personality. When I meet them I avoid questions about where I live, what my job is, how old I am, or what I do with my time. Because the answers are all pathetic.

I've completely fucked my brain up to the point where I can't enjoy anything without some drug - legal, prescription, or illegal. I'm doing better with this antidepressant, Valdoxan. AKA Agomelatine. In fact, it's working miracles. I love it. But I don't want to need it. It's opened my eyes to how fucked up I let things get. And I bet I only need it in the first place because I spent the last five years drinking, smoking pot, browsing reddit, and binging on junk food - destroying the reward centres of my brain. Not everyone who uses antidepressants deserves it, but I do. I put myself in this situation.

I know most people can use these things in moderation and that's fine. Not everyone is the same as me. But I can't. Actually I can, that's the thing. I don't even drink more than once every week or two. I don't have that much coffee compared to alot of people. But I let it completely get to me. I let them take over. I use these things and avoid doing anything else.

The state of my life is my own fault. I don't blame drugs. And I'm not going to go the rest of my life without a coffee or a cider or a joint, or looking at a funny picture on the internet. But from now on they're occasional things, not my life. These things will no longer be the primary way I feel good. I will no longer be dependent on them.

I'm gonna stick with the antidepressants until I have my shit in order, but one day I'm getting off those too.

If you read this, thanks very much. It helps to get things off my chest. And knowing that I told even one person helps me stick to it.

For now, I get a job, move out of my parents, and get my teeth fixed. This is step 1.

And then I'm gonna start creating things. Read some books. Learn to make music. Maybe save up and travel. Maybe return to university. Maybe finally do some acting. ",17Jan2017,335

43,"The FBI and DOJ have a history of conflict [1][2][3][4][5]. There is a pattern where the DOJ will block or stall an FBI investigation, and the FBI will leak to the press to ""get things moving."" It appears that this pattern manifests when the subjects of these investigations are wealthy or powerful.

Things were no different in the events leading up to Comey's infamous letter [6]. The DOJ had previously curtailed the investigation into Clinton's private email server using suspicious immunity deals and other means [4]. Since then, the DOJ had been trying to block the FBI's investigation into the Clinton Foundation [5], and some unfortunate circumstances and misunderstandings surrounding FBI deputy director McCabe might have given the appearance he had likewise unethically favored Clinton [6][7]. Reportedly, there has been sharp internal division in the FBI over McCabe and how to handle matters with the Clinton Foundation investigation [6].

When the FBI agents in charge of investigating the Clinton Foundation were told (apparently by Robert Capers, who had been acting strangely [5]) that these same suspicious immunity deals would block them from using potentially valuable evidence from the email investigation, and they tried to get around this by asking a more zealous prosecutor (apparently Preet Bharara, who has a track-record for high-profile corruption cases), McCabe shot down their attempts, saying ""you can't go prosecutor shopping."" [6]

It was shortly after this that FBI agents informed Comey and other FBI leaders about Anthony Weiner's laptop full of Clinton emails, and Comey sent his letter to the Oversight Committee.

Since it occurred following these events, and so late in the election, presenting the Weiner laptop to Comey appears to be an aggressive move by these agents. 

Their motive is unclear and we must speculate. They might have felt that Comey and McCabe had sided with the DOJ over them. It is unclear if these agents distrusted Comey or not, or to what extent. There had been a Russian propaganda campaign to paint Comey as covering for Clinton when he declined to indict her, and Rudy Giuliani, who supposedly has ties with some FBI agents, had repeatedly insinuated the same [8][9][10].

If they didn't distrust Comey's character, they might have mistrusted his judgement. Running up to election day, there had been widely reported concerns and plots of election day violence or overthrowing the government [11][12][13][14][15] if Clinton won, and this was stoked in part by rhetoric that we have a ""rigged system"" [16][17]. One possible motive is that these agents felt government leadership wasn't doing enough to address concerns that our system is rigged, and that they had to take matters into their own hands. The DOJ had been largely operating in coverups up to this point, but coverups are unethical and also risky, since the Russians had shown they were capable and willing to hack and release information that shows our system is rigged. Under these circumstances, the only way to mitigate the risk is to practice integrity and transparency.

Hillary's emails could have been another motivation. It has been widely known that Russia all but certainly has copies of all of Clinton's emails from her time as Secretary of State [18][19][20][21]. But these are the same emails the FBI reviewed in the course of their investigations. Because of Clinton's character issues [23] and history of unethical behavior [24], it's not unreasonable to expect that the FBI found something in Hillary's emails that would have guaranteed her loss if released by the Russians. If this is true, then the only way we could have stopped Russia from getting Trump elected would have been by convincing Hillary to drop out. The agents investigating the Clinton Foundation would have been especially aware of this, and they were the ones who had been scorned before the Weiner laptop was presented to Comey.

As with these FBI agents, we can only mostly speculate on Comey's motives for sending his letters. According to the Wall Street Journal, ""FBI officials were ... concerned that if they didn’t act, the information might leak out anyway, in a less controlled manner,"" [24] and ""Senior FBI officials decided that sitting on what they know would be a worse course of action than notifying Congress now while they undertake their investigation."" [25] Reuters also reported that ""FBI Director James Comey was driven in part by a fear of leaks from within his agency when he decided to tell Congress the FBI was investigating newly discovered emails related to Hillary Clinton."" [26] With the buildup of frustration, infighting, and aggression leading up to Comey's decision [5][6][27][28], he may have faced a situation about to spiral out of control.

After these events, Comey sent this letter to Congress [29]:

&gt;In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton's personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony.

&gt;Investigation connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.

&gt;Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.

If the goal of the rebellious FBI agents was to restore faith in a rigged justice system and slash the odds of election day violence or insurrection, Comey's letter would have been more than enough [30]. And if the extent of the story in the media was ""we found more emails we have to review but it might be nothing,"" the impact of the whole ordeal on the election would have been minimized. But moments after Comey's letter, someone leaked that the new emails were found while searching Weiner's laptop for child porn, that the laptop was shared between Huma and Weiner, and that the emails included correspondence between Huma and Clinton, sparking a media sensation. Hours later, Comey's second letter [31] was leaked, saying:

&gt;...given that we do not know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don’t want to create a misleading impression. In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter, and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it.

Whatever the public heard, they didn't hear it from Comey [32]. Clinton's email scandal was dragged with Weiner's sexting scandal with a 15-year-old girl to the front-and-center of national attention, while tabloids peddled rumors that the now sensational scandal drove a rift between the once inseparable Huma and Hillary. By fivethirtyeight's model, Hillary's chance of winning went from 82% before the scandal to 71% on election day [33]. If Comey was hoping his letters would stop leaks or minimize their impact on the election, it appears he did not succeed. It is unclear if his letters got buried by the media frenzy or if they added to it.

Still, we don't know what would have happened if Comey hadn't sent those letters. If rebellious FBI agents weren't satisfied after Comey sent his letters, it's doubtful they would have been satisfied if he did nothing. In this case, Comey could have seen growing insurrection in the FBI and an increasingly unstable situation, and so a greater risk of leaks from FBI agents. It's also possible that the leaks weren't by FBI agents at all. Further, if Comey hadn't forced Trump to say ""I guess the system isn't rigged after all"" (and made him look like an idiot flip-flopping), there would have been a greater risk of election day violence by angry Trump supporters thinking there's no hope our justice system can stop corrupt politicians. This could have compelled FBI agents could to leak even more.

Nor can we say for sure if Comey actually broke the policy of not commenting on ongoing investigations. The email investigation was closed after Comey decided not to indict, and he had agreed during his hearings with the oversight committee to be as transparent as he could with his testimony. When Comey sent his letter, the investigation was still closed--the FBI didn't have a warrant. This was a situation were Comey was keeping his promise to be as transparent as he could about an old closed investigation, while simultaneously breaking his promise by commenting on a future new one--there was no way to keep both promises. This doesn't seem like a common situation for the FBI.

It's also interesting that Clinton had called the previous investigation of her a ""security review"" [34] when it was a criminal investigation, but, in his first letter, Comey called this a ""review"" while Clinton insists it was an investigation.

Regardless, whether Comey broke the rules for commenting on ongoing investigations or not, breaking a rule once does not justify breaking it again.

There is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding Comey's decision and the events surrounding it. Maybe, instead of calling for Comey to resign, we should withhold our judgement for the results of a proper and independent investigation [35].

Claire, a quiet girl by nature, often found casual conversation to be a bit of a chore. So it was that, tonight, and quite to her delight, that her family was quite silent during dinner, the sound of her eating utensil echoing from the walls becoming the only constant source of noise that lent itself wonderfully to the overall ambiance of the room in which they dined. She finished her dinner in silence and excused herself from the table, taking the plate into the kitchen, and rinsed it off in the sink, placing it in the open dishwasher.

She had decided against announcing her departure, instead opting to simply open the front door, and head out into the night, breathing in sharply as the cold air collided with her face and hands. 

Her family had moved to this town a few years back. Her father, a real estate agent, had quickly found work with a local business, selling commercial property to prospective clients, and her mother, lacking the ability to walk, worked from home, blogging about different topics relating to physical disabilities. Her brother, who was almost a decade younger than she, attended the local High School, where he barely scraped by with a C average and spent his days writing short fiction and drawing; time, she felt, could have been better spent actually studying the topics in which he was enrolled.

She stuffed her hands into her coat pockets, and fidgeted with their contents. She could feel a set of keys, a pack of chewing gum, and some loose change, the latter of which was most likely left over from her purchase of the gum. 

She didn't mind living here too much. The neighborhood was like a quiet, slumbering beast, waiting for that right combination of people and events to bring it to life. She imagined the houses as sleeping giants, ready to awaken and destroy everything and everyone at a moments notice. She was so deep in her thoughts, in fact, that she had barely noticed that she was no longer even in her own neighborhood, but rather, the path leading into the woods that surrounded it. Darkness surrounded her and seem to envelop everything that it touched; she could not even see the steam of her breath as it rose out in front of her.

She had walked this path a few times before, but never in the depths of the night; always in daylight. Daylight felt like safety. It felt like comfort. It felt somewhat familiar. In the absence of all light, the familiarity that she had come to associate with the path itself seemed to dissolve into the abyss of her subconscious, just out of reach of her waking mind; even the soft echo of her footsteps from the pavement to the trees felt somehow alien now. 

Claire continued walking forward, a feeling of unease beginning to creep its way across her body. She wondered if she should turn back, however, against her better judgement, decided to push forward; forward into the known unknown. However, there was something different about the path this time. A strange light could be seen in the distance, coming from a source she could not identify. As she continued to walk, cautiously, she realized that the light was coming from a house buried in the woods off of the trail. She had never seen this place before, and her curiosity began to get the better of her. Deciding to venture a quick look, she turned off the pavement and began walking through the leaves and grass that covered the ground beneath the trees.

As she drew closer to the little house, she could see a large window facing her, into which she could see perfectly, as the light that she had initially seen was coming from a lamp on a table in the center of the room into which she now looked. Seated around the table were five people, or at least what she had initially thought were people, but something was odd about them. Their faces were distorted somehow; where there should be eyes, there were none, and where there should be mouths, there was nothing. As she came closer and closer to the glass, at this point, unable to stop herself, slowly, each face began to turn in her direction. Her feet would not stop themselves. They were all looking at her. She didn't know what she was doing, or how to stop it from happening.

One by one, the figures slowly rose from their seated position, the light in the center of the table flickering, once, twice, then darkness. Claire could hear her own heartbeat in her ears and her breathing was becoming faster. The sound of a door in dire need of oil opening slowly and the rustling of leaves as individual sets of feet crushed them individually. And the noise, coming closer, grew louder, and she couldn't make herself move. She screamed in her head for her legs to work, to run, to turn at least. ***To do something!*** And the sounds were now all around her and she could feel the presence of others from every angle and she knew that she was surrounded.

A thin, pale, ray of light cast itself through the trees from above, and Claire could, for a moment, see everything around. She was alone. The house which she had been looking into, gone. Somehow finding the strength to move again, she ran, as fast as she could carry herself, back to the trail, and, moments later, she was back in her neighborhood. The feelings of fear and anxiety were slowly passing, and she leaned against the trunk of a tree to catch her breath. Her lungs burned from the cold air, but the feelings of relief that were washing over her at that moment was more than enough to make her feel somewhat better. 

As she turned to walk home, she was stopped, dead in her tracks, by one of the faceless individuals. Her mouth opened to scream, but no sound could come out. Her eyes widened in horror, her hands instinctively going up to shield herself, and her legs began to feel weak. The figure reached his hands out and grabbed her by skull. A momentary blinding flash of light overtook her senses, and an impossible flash of imagery exploded into her mind. 

She could see them. All of them. ***Thousands*** of them. They were everywhere. The town was infested by them. They were pouring into the streets from the houses and the buildings and the surrounding woods. She couldn't see any people, just these figures, and they were seemingly without end. As she watched, the houses began to burn and the sky turned a blood red as the moon fell from the heavens and the clouds tore apart. And the sound of a song, one which she hadn't heard in years, echoed through the chaos. And a voice, whispering to her: ""*Find him.*"" It seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. It filled her entire being up with its noise. ""*Find him.*"" White static noise humming low in the background, its noise intensifying with each passing second, until her senses were overburdened by it as it hung heavy in the atmosphere. ""*Find him.*""

And, just as violently as it had started, the vision ended, and Claire was sitting in her kitchen, quietly eating her dinner. As she cut her steak into tiny pieces, the blood from within the meat pooled at the edges of it, and stained the lump of mashed potatoes sitting idly by it. Her father, clearing his throat, began talking to her. Or, at least, he appeared to be talking. All she could hear was the crashing of static, as it grew louder and louder in her ears. She simply kept chewing her steak, smiled, and nodded. ",17Jan2017,1
56,"Hello everyone,

I've been going to the gym off and on, but I've pretty much lost my motivation.

I've heard that the juice allows you to train harder and get better results.

Furthermore, I know guys who use steroids, and they get laid like tile. It seems women are really into well-muscled men.

Do you think I should start using them as well? How expensive would it be to do it safely, and to avoid any issues with law enforcement?",17Jan2017,1
58,"TLDR: Meet new girl, and we really hit it off, but I have gone back to Melbourne, while she's working in Dubai. Skip to below the line to see the pickle.

I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. I am a 23 yr guy, living and working in Melbourne, but I was in Dubai for two weeks (where my family lives) for a wedding. I had done my higher education (BA &amp; MSc) abroad, but I lived and worked in Dubai last year, tutoring for a company. When I went back at the beginning of 2017, I met up with 2 of my old colleagues (and close friends), and met three new tutors, one of whom I was very much attracted to instantly (call her L).

The first time we all met, we stayed in at their place and played a drinking game, and L &amp; I got to know each other a little better. I also ended up naked at one point (the rules of the game fucked me over basically) which was something I was pretty anxious about. She also had to take off some of her clothes, but asked to use my shirt to wrap around her waist. In any case, we all get pretty drunk and have a pretty great time.

Fast forward a week, and I've met up with the tutoring group a couple more times, once to celebrate one of last year's tutor's birthdays at the office. I'm invited to join them on a Thursday evening birthday bash + club do, but I have been roped into doing some wedding stuff (I was best man), and thought that the group having dinner for the wedding thing would be going out afterwards or doing something at all, so I had to decline. Luckily, the wedding thing ended after dinner, so hit up my tutoring friends, and went over to get drunk.

We play a drinking game, and again, people have to flash or whatever (sounds so fucken stupid when you say it out loud), but L seems to be on top form, enjoying herself immensely. One of the other new tutors (call her G) has been flirting with me, but I'm not interested (I mean, I made polite conversation with her but that was about it). G then proceeds to very indiscreetly ask the other tutors if it would be ok if she could sleep with me. At this point, my internal cringe speedometer has hit unprecedented levels, since I am not really used to girls being into me (#unrequitedlove FeelsBadMan). In any case, I try to gently let her down after she is turned away at the club for being super obnoxious to the security guard. I'm not sure if L is even interested in me, but I don't particularly care. I just wanted to get into the club and drink myself into oblivion.

We all get to dancing (bar G, who's gone home to have sex with some rando on Tinder), and drinking and we're all having a great fucken time. But L keeps doing weird things, like licking my elbow after accidentally spilling her wine on me (who drinks wine in the middle of a dance floor is what I want to know). But, don't think much of it, and eventually we get separated, and I buy her a drink. We stand in a corner of the club, just recovering and trying to communicate. Then we start to look at each other silently, smiling, and all of a sudden all the pieces fall into place and I realize that she is hitting on me, something I'm not really used to (see para 3). So we kiss, and we basically dance for another hour or so, by ourselves, just going at it. Anyways, some other stuff happens that isn't particularly relevant to this story, but we go home at the end of the night, and stuff happens, and we stay up until 8 AM talking and spooning (which I had forgotten how much I had missed!).

I'm completely stunned by all this, and so can't sleep. I leave at about 10.30, and she's still asleep, so I write her a little cute note (which she still hasn't thrown away although how important that is, I don't know). Riding a high of emotions for the rest of the day, have the bachelor party that day (Friday) and then have the wedding on Saturday (didn't sleep much on Fri because I was still in awe of Thursday, and Saturday evening I was super wasted by the end!)

I invite all the tutors out to dinner on Sunday evening, because I am leaving on Monday evening (a tradition among the group when someone is leaving), and things aren't that awkward between L and I, but it is a little. Finish dinner, the tutors invite me back to theirs to talk for a little longer, and we do. Pretty great time, and I can't help but keep staring at L when she's not looking. Evening winds down, and everybody leaves one by one, except L and I, but then I get super autistic, and panicky, and say bye and just leave. I can't really read her expression, but I'm kicking myself for not telling her how I feel. Sit on the porch outside, and decide to message her for a bit, and she returns the messages, and eventually I just ask her if she wants to just talk in person. She replies by saying yes, I really need a cuddle! And I feel like a fucking rockstar at this point. She opens the door, and we go upstairs, and again stuff happens, but neither of us sleeps at all that night, and we just talk and spoon and cuddle, and whatever. In any case, she escorts me out, and we kiss a couple of times just before I leave. 

******

The point is: I have a really strong set of feelings for this girl, but she currently lives in Dubai, and probably will ship out by July, to god knows where, and I'm stuck in Melbourne at my dream position. I haven't been able to stop thinking about her since we met, and I haven't felt this way about someone ever (not even the two girls I had previously seen at one time or another). There isn't a question to this story, but I just needed to get this off my chest. I am both immeasurably happy that we even spent any time together at all (optimist in me), but also harrowingly upset that I don't really get a chance to explore what could be, if it could be at all. If you read even the 'highlights' of the story, thank you very much!",17Jan2017,2
59,"I was a sheltered kid. I didn't learn any social skills until high school and because my family lost everything I ended up dropping out and getting a GED. I never hung out with people, aside from the one girlfriend I had, and I frequently get depressed because of the experiences other people had in their teenage years that I'll never have.

Last month I met a girl on okcupid and we got coffee at a place I know. We hit it off really well and got dinner a few days later, then the next week we ended up making out in my truck in a parking lot. She went back to school on the other side of the state, but we kept talking. Nonstop texting for two weeks, so much in common, same music, same movies and shows, just everything. 

I'm originally from the part of the state she goes to school in, so I decided to make a trip home for the weekend, and she wanted me to spend the night with her. I knew we'd be having sex, so all week I worked myself up about it, and since I've only had sex with one other person I was really nervous about lasting long enough and satisfying her.

So I was at her place, we're spooning in her bed watching a movie, and she put my hand on her chest and we started kissing. It was amazing. We took our clothes off, I kept thinking ""ohmygod ohmygod it's happening, it's finally happening"" and a psyched myself up so much that I lost the boner. Fucking ruined the mood and she said it was okay and we'd try again later. After one more failed attempt later we had sex and it was great (or so I thought), and when I left the next day we hugged and kissed and made plans for when she came down to visit family this weekend.

Then I left and...nothing. I've been ghosted before so I know how it is but this time I just... It feels like I finally met someone who was perfect and I blew it in such an embarrassing way. I want to meet people, and experience as much as I can, and learn things I should have ten years ago, but it's so discouraging to be doing so well and then have it be derailed by my lack of experience. 

My truck broke down on the way home and I'm completely broke now. I haven't been this depressed in years. I'm typing this out because, even though I feel terrible, I'm going to keep going. I'm going to save my money, get a second job, and go back to school in the fall. 

Life sucks sometimes, but sometimes it doesn't. If I die poor and alone at least I gave it my all. ",17Jan2017,10
60,"My depressive thoughts seem to get worse bit by bit. I moved away from family for work with my girlfriend &amp; after we split up I had a panic attack a few years ago. I saw a counsellor for a little while but found it hard to open up to a stranger without feeling judged. Our time ended &amp; maybe I was lying to myself that I was better &amp; done with that weird anomaly in my life. Still had chest pains, constant headache &amp; couldn't get more than 3 hours sleep without waking up for about 2 years. Slowly things got better &amp; back to normal for around a year. Last year I saw myself becoming very emotional &amp; my thoughts were only negative.  Parents are both having some health issues &amp; I'm only thinking what things are going to be like when they're gone. What is it going to be like going into their house after or going through &amp; getting rid of their things. Do I have any recent photos to remember them by.  My dog is getting up in age, his last few years I know &amp; I'm going to be lost without him. Where am I going to bury him. I'm going to be a wreck throwing his toys &amp; bed out.
I went back to the counsellor but find it really difficult to get this stuff out sitting there with a person staring at me &amp; can't get deeper into my head. Only lasted a couple sessions, I'm breaking down crying &amp; she says that this is the last one there's nothing else she can help me with. I've been together with a girl since just after that &amp; things were going well, back to exercising, no chest pains or headaches, getting good sleep, not having many negative thoughts if any. But in the past few weeks I'm back down in that hole.  Had another panic attack &amp; I start distancing myself from people, afraid I'm going to start crying out of the blue.  
I'm scared that this is my life now, that it's never going to be gone for good.  I might have periods of happiness &amp; living my life normally but I'll keep getting drug down by my own thoughts.  Most of me thinks I should move back closer to family but that will mean saying goodbye to the gf. The other part of me thinks that I am running away from life &amp; going back to what's familiar &amp; comfortable. ",17Jan2017,25
