0,"3 ways to have sex.


Relationships
Rape
Red light district (prostitution)


2 of those are currently illegal.


I'm not interested in a relationship. Girls are turned off by me anyway because I'm lazy and also don't put them on a pedestal (For example, I don't believe that men shouldn't hit women).


I believe friends with benefits is a myth. It is not in women's nature to want to have NSA sex. For women, there needs to be an emotional connection. They aren't like men, who will fuck anything that walks, crawls, slithers, or flys. Sex isn't a big deal for them and [the slightest of things will turn them off.](http://thestir.cafemom.com/love/132222/35_brutally_honest_reasons_women)",19Apr2017,0
2,"Dunno why. He's been dead as long as I can remember. Offed himself before I was even a year old.


Yet sometimes I think about how life would be if I did have a dad. Would life be a bit more stable? Who would I even be right now?


I feel like the wort part is that I can't tell if it'd be for better or worse if I had a father figure.


I dunno. I just had to get it out for once.",19Apr2017,3
3,"I've had a lot of crazy stuff going on in my life recently so it's very possible that it's just nerves. It's exam time of the semester, there was the stress of travel for family Easter dinner, and worst of all, my grandfather passed away on Sunday morning after suffering from Alzheimer's for five years (rest in peace grampy).

But I'm also wondering if I could actually be sick. I've been vaccinated and no one I know has had the flu but I have very flu-like symptoms: frequent nausea (haven't thrown up yet though), loss of appetite, occasional headache, etc.

I've been considering making an appointment with my family doctor but like I said, I'm not sure if I'm sick or just stressed to the maximum.

All I know is it's getting harder to fall asleep which sucks because I have my last exam in 8 hours...",19Apr2017,1
4,"I've been running and running and running and running all week. I have 2 tests coming up (one for American Government and Politics and one for Biology). I had a meeting for a trip I'm going on so I got home at 9 which totally threw off my sleep schedule (but not really because I've been on my phone until 11pm-12am lately). I feel like I could be doing more but I don't know where to start. I just finished printing out the Quizlet for my Biology test and it's memorization, but I suck at remembering. Of course I left myself one day to do all of the studying. I can't wait until this week is over. I feel like all my weeks have been this same way for a while now. It's hard to sleep even though I need it, it's hard to study even though I have the time, just not the motivation, and it's hard to enjoy life when I have to worry about these upcoming things. I feel like whenever I put something off a little bit, it becomes a train wreck. But somehow I've managed to do everything this way, considering I have a 3.9 unweighted GPA. I try to motivate myself to study by telling myself I _can_ be better than that one really smart kid, even though everyone in my class thinks I'm that smart kid, but I'm really not. I'm not even sure if it's luck or if me paying attention in class just helps a lot. I've managed to BS my way by for 7 months this school year. Anwyay, going to sleep now. (11:13PM)",19Apr2017,1
6,"As many of you guys probably know, earlier today a man shot and killed three men in Fresno. The man is black, his last name is Muhammed, and he shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" when he killed them. I saw the post in /r/news, and, like I often do when I see important or interesting posts almost anywhere online, I went to the comments section to see what people were saying. I had a general idea of what it would look like, but I was honestly surprised by how disgusting I found the comments. There was little to no sympathy for the victims. Instead, most of the comments were comparing this tragedy to a hate crime that received traction earlier in the day, where a Sikh man was accosted and had his turban knocked off, the allegation being that some kind of sick agenda was covering up the Fresno shooting and somehow trying to make the case that the earlier incident was being considered a worse tragedy. I haven't seen anyone say that, and it strikes me as incredibly callous to use discussion space for a tragedy like what happened in Fresno to go back and delegitimize the experience of a totally innocent man in a totally unrelated incident. 

The other theme running through was the main reason I wanted to write this post; the idea that Muslims aren't doing enough to combat radical Islam, and the idea that radical Islam is some kind of special problem that we need to reveal and examine in a way that we aren't already. I don't expect anything to come of this, but I spend a lot of time on this site, and things like this make me increasingly uncomfortable with that. Because this discussion isn't happening in a way that demonstrates any kind of compassion. There's no acknowledgement of the fact that Muslims are, by far, the number one victims of Islamic terror attacks. Or that Muslims are mounting, again, by far, the biggest defense against ISIS and other coherent radical Islamic threats. There's no mention of the fact that most Muslim communities in America are on a constant lookout for radicalization; instead, there's just this creeping implication that they're standing by and watching it happen. 

Most of all, though, the idea that radical Islam is some kind of special radicalization that we need to recognize in order to combat is just incorrect. Radicalization is far more connected to other conditions than it is to ideology, and just about anyone who studies radicalization will tell you that. There is radical Communism, radical hate against Communists, radical religious zealots of all colors and creeds, especially throughout history. By far the most significant predictors of radicalization are not related whatsoever to ideology, and the whole ""we need to say the words ""Radical Islamic Terror"""" thing completely ignores that truth. And it kills me, too, because I know that often these are people who would be enraged if someone were to say something like ""men are by far the most significant perpetrators of sexual assault; why aren't they doing anything about it?"" or any such similar sentiment about atheist school shooters or, god forbid, the actions of Christian and secular Western nations abroad that have led to the deaths of thousands and thousands more than Islamic terror has. And let's say all us sheeple wake up, and call it Radical Islamic Terror, and stop ""pushing our agenda"" and all that, then what? How does that help us actually solve any of these problems? I've never been able to grasp what Step 2 is, what happens after we *finally* acknowledge that terrorists are often Muslim.

I'm not Muslim, or any kind of person of color or anything like that, so in that sense I'm not personally victimized by this hate at all. But I have Muslim friends, and I know Muslim people, and it sincerely hurts me to see these situations used to reveal some imagined conspiracy that Muslims and a Liberal Agenda are concealing the fact that people are committing terror attacks in the name of Islam, and to then run with that assumption to indict all of Islam and all those who might defend it. I know this is fairly incoherent and rambly, but it just makes me so sick to see people use these tragedies to throw large, diverse groups of people different than them under the bus, and it grows harder and harder for me to be on this website when discussions like this are the most visible and upvoted in huge default subs. And I'm a straight white dude; I can only imagine how difficult it might be for those less in line with Reddit's user base to come on here and see this kind of stuff thrown out with such abandon and met with such approval. Whatever, maybe I'm a liberal cuck, or in the pockets of ShareBlue or whatever, but I just had to say something at least to make myself feel better. I hope I'm not the only one, and more than that, I hope we can be more constructive and respectful in the wake of tragedies like the one earlier today.",19Apr2017,0
8,"I know you're worried about a lot of things right now. All I had ever done is try to help and make things easier for you, if I could. I know we don't know each too well, considering we only just met 1 1/2 months ago, and I really thought you weren't the type to behave this way, but now I see that whatever is happening in your life is probably just too much for both of us to handle. 

All I wanted was for you to have one less worry on your mind. So when the condom slipped off last night, and I fortuitously received a phone call the next morning from my doctor telling me my STD results were negative, I thought it would only be considerate to let you know. 

I guess I was wrong. I honestly thought it would be a relief, not just another concern. I don't know what I did wrong, still. 

I'm a little hurt, to be honest. And I realize this isn't about me, but I drive an hour every time I go see you, pay for the things we do because I know you can't afford it, lent you my expensive speaker so you can listen to your music, bought you weed so you can relax, told you you don't have to commit to anything with me because I understand how stressful your life is right now, and even offered to buy you a desk so that you can be more productive while looking for a job. I've never asked for anything in return, but now that I'm being treated like a villain, one request comes to mind: can I have the benefit of the doubt?

And that last text you sent, that was hurtful. You lashed out at me, and for what?  Updating you on your sexual health? Giving you some positive news? Trying to help? 

Apparently, whatever I did was enough for you to think bad things of me, even though all I've ever done is be patient and give *you* the benefit of the doubt. Like when you texted me 10 minutes before arriving to our first date to tell me you had to cancel. Or when your canceled our last 2 dates, but then changed your mind again. Wasn't I patient? Didn't I say not to worry about it? That I knew your were going through a lot and I wasn't expecting anything, except honesty and communication? I guess I should have said understanding as well. 

It doesn't matter. As I sit here and type all this out, I've realized I'm putting more effort into this than its worth. Too bad. I guess I just thought you were different. 

Good bye, Natalia.",19Apr2017,1
9,"I was too desperate. Too desperate for someone to love. You were so beautiful to me, I wanted to believe that you were someone that I could trust, someone that I could love. But the red flags were there from the beginning. After the first time I slept with you, I asked you who that was on your phone. You told me it was your boyfriend that you met while you were traveling in China, but you brushed him off, saying that you weren't that serious with him at the time. I believed you. But I didn't want to make things serious with you until you broke it off with him. So I begrudgingly accepted the fact that you would continue to text him with affirmations of love while you cheated on him with me, thinking that what we had was special. But then you hurt me with the fact that you were sleeping with yet someone else even while you told me that you loved me and told me that I was special. I found out while I looked through your phone while you were asleep. All those times you didn't text me back, you were with this other guy. I was ready to end things with you at this point, but you insisted that I was the one you were planning your future with all this time, and that this other guy was just away for you to get a job since you had a felony on your record. I should've trusted my instincts, but I allowed my desperation to make my decision for me because I didn't think I could find someone as beautiful as you to ever love me as I thought you did. So I told you I forgave you. I told you that I'd believe that you could change. We traveled together. We spent so much time together. I thought that I was happy. But that was only when I was physically with you. When you weren't with me, my mind was formulating all the ways that you could have been cheating on me, all the ways that you could have deceived me. I don't know if you did, but the mere fact that you could have, coupled with the way you so casually cheated on the guy you were supposedly dating with me, and the fact that you decided to put what we had aside to fuck some other guy while we were dating, made me decide to end things with you. I used our political differences as an excuse to end things, but that wasn't the real reason. And when you texted me weeks later about how you were still angry about how things ended, I eventually gave in and apologized for how I broke up with you. I even told you the real reason I broke up with you. And you told me that it was never too late. I took those words to heart and decided to try again with our relationship. But you let me down yet again. I wanted honesty. I wanted the truth from you. But when I drove to your house to confirm whether you were telling me the truth, I found out that you were yet again dishonest. You told me that you were at your house, watching TV with your family. But your truck wasn't there. Yet you insisted you were there and that you couldn't see me from your window. I told you that I wasn't bluffing and that I was actually at your house. In response, you hung up the phone and blocked me. I talked to your mom and her boyfriend about you that night, since you weren't home after all and they were nice enough to invite to inside to talk and even sip some beers and smoke some cigarettes with them. After I told them I was gonna go home, I didn't. I wanted to wait for you to give you a piece of my mind. So I did. I didn't even have to wait ten minutes before you rolled up in you stupid truck. You stupid lifted truck that probably got like ten miles to the gallon. I rolled up to you and gave you the finger and told you what a piece of shit you were. I turned around and called you a liar and whore, which I believe were not untruthful statements. You decided to serve me with a restraining order. Thanks for that. Thanks for your dishonesty and manipulation. You thought that you could get away with your actions by getting me in trouble with the authorities. But I know you lied under oath. I never threatened you or even got out of my car when I drove up next to you. Maybe I was verbally abusive. But you deserved every bit of what I told you. You are a liar. You are a whore. And I hope that you get every bit of what you deserve. Because I'm going to fight this. I'm not letting you lie under oath and get away with it. Because I actually give value to the truth. Unlike you, who lies to get what they want. Fuck you. Fuck you and your dishonest ways. I hope you rot in hell. You're the worst kind of person. No wonder you've never been able to keep a real relationship for more than a year. You're a former drug addict and you've had sex with more that 75 people at the tender age of 21. Most of them in order to get something you wanted. You're also a thief. You shoplifted right in front of me, shamelessly, and your justification was that the grocery store should have had better security. You're the type of person who would do whatever you could if you could get away with it. I'm sorry that I ever trusted you, but I'm not sorry that I tried to verify what you told me. Trust but verify. I don't know how long it'll take for me to trust someone again, but I'm not going to let you ruin the rest of my life because of you shitty actions. Again, fuck you. I hope you rot in hell someday. I won't let my desperation to find someone to love distort my judgment ever again.",19Apr2017,0
10,"I'm 100% convinced I'm shadowbanned from /r/hiphopheads and I have no clue why or how to have it resolved.

I noticed about 3 months ago that my posts weren't being responded to or voted in either direction.  I received no message from the mods (thinking maybe I broke a rule??)

I have repeatedly tried messaging the mods over there to no avail.  I also have tried digging through Reddit's site-wide guidelines and it appears that subreddit-specific shadowbanning was not in place anymore.

Anyone have any way for me to get this resolved and be able to post over there again normally?  I'll buy you gold or something...",19Apr2017,1
11,"I have noticed that I mostly think as if I was telling someone what is happening, or writing it later about it. 

For example, if before I fall asleep I remember a negative high school memory, instead of just thinking about it I imagine as if I was telling it to someone, or mostly, as if I were writing it on a reddit post. Sometimes I not even make a post I wanted because after I ""thought"" it over it almost feels as if I had already written it down.

I have done this for as long as I can remember. When I was younger I would think as if I was telling an interviewer what happened, as if I would become famous one day.

Is it normal? Sometimes I realize what I am doing and I feel bothered by it.",19Apr2017,7

13,"First of all, I am getting annoyed with my friend's fiancee, who is also my good friend. Before they started dating, I knew that his fiancee has issues she has to work on. The number one issue she has is probably insecure. I try to avoid from hearing about their relationship because it is none of my business. It is their own business. If I heard about their relationship often, I would feel like I want to give them a lecture on how to have a healthy relationship.

His fiancee always got paranoid when he looked at another woman. He didn't check her out. He just looked around. I know he is faithful. I get it that her ex-boyfriends cheated on her, but it doesn't mean all men are cheaters! She has to grow up! It is not fair to her fiance. If he did cheat on her, know what? She doesn't need him at all. If my boyfriend cheated on me, I'd dump him for good. Who the hell wants to stay with a cheater? I'd be glad I got to see his true side rather than working hard to make sure he is not attracted to any woman and asking him NOT to be attracted to anyone. It was what she asked him after he proposed to her. That doesn't sound like she is trusting him 100%. What if his feelings changed? She has to fucking accept so hard! If my boyfriend changed his feelings, I'd be devastated of course, but I would want him to tell me and end the relationship rather than keeping him in an unhappy relationship and being cheated on. It means it would provide me an opportunity to find someone else I deserve so much better. It is way better than getting divorced in 20 years later.

When we talked about a woman with huge breasts in one video game, she said, ""I am glad [his name] didn't see that."" I mentally facepalmed. Seriously!? It is just a fucking video game! She even prohibited him from watching porn. I asked her why? She said it is so WEIRD and she didn't want him to look at other women. So? They are just porn...as long as he didn't get addicted to them. She could join him watching porn just to get to know his inner fantasies and what sex acts he would like to try. I am not going to argue with her because it is not my relationship.

Now you get the idea how his fiancee is... I know she sounds so fucking possessive and insecure. I hate insecure girls! I am sooooo glad I am NOT insecure. Anyway, my friend and I planned on going to the festival somewhere this month. He wanted his fiancee to join us, so I agreed Then he told me that he had to check on her to make sure if it is okay just in case if she couldn't join us that day. Basically, he asked her for his permission if he could hang out with his friend. She should know me well because I did NEVER touch him. I wouldn't be so close to him. We never held the hand or acted like a couple. We were friends before I first met her. I felt like I wanted to give them a lecture. Instead of giving them a lecture, I told him that he didn't have to tell me about his relationship policy because it is his and her business, not my business. In my personal opinion, the relationship shouldn't feel like a prison at all. You are still allowed to make your own choices as long as you're still faithful to your partner. Later, I told him I didn't want anyone at the festival to think that we are a couple because I want guys to acknowledge that I am not taken. He replied, ""That is why [his fiancee's name] didn't want anyone to think we are a couple."" Oh, please... She is overreacting, and she shouldn't care about what people think. It is not like we're going to see them again. If they asked us, we could correct them. He could say he already has a fiancee and even show a picture of them together. I know people to automatically assume that you and your friend of opposite sex are a couple, but who cares?? We weren't lovey dovey at all. We were just hanging out as friends. We didn't even hold the hand or sit side by side. In my case, it does matter a little because I want guys to know I am not taken. Anyway, do you think his fiancee is overreacting? I think she is, and she is also very insecure. She is the kind of girl who thinks she needs to have a man to make her happy. She is fucking 27 years old, and her perspective on relationship is similar to high school girl's. I am two years younger than her, and I feel like I am mature with dating and relationships than she is.",19Apr2017,1

My name is Ben. I'm some random American mid 20s guy. I started a twitch.tv stream out of spite a couple weeks ago and it's been going surprisingly well.

Part of my stream is sharing about the importance that food plays in terms of self expression within Jewish culture. I have compiled a list of my absolutely most delicious food pictures and have set up a strawpoll via my stream for people to vote. It would mean so much to know that strangers are looking at my favorite foods.

Real talk I don't even have a donation button. Just love sharing food with new people :]

Being able to confide in someone when I'm feeling down. I miss being able to share my experiences and thoughts with someone, who even though they may not be super interested in the topic or know hardly anything about it, will listen to me ramble. I miss sharing a comfortable silence with someone, the kind of silence where nobody needs to talk because the both of us already know what the other is feeling.

21,"Been dating a few months things felt great. I knew I loved this girl after two months. Like it wasn't wanting to fuck her it was ""I know I just want to wake up next to you in bed and cook you breakfast"". 

I fell in love with a girl who has some other issues, just the same type of Depression/Anxiety/ADHD type shit that a lot of people out there deal with. 

The first problem happened when she told me she wanted to make some money and didn't want to get a job, she wanted a sugar daddy. I'm busting my ass 48+ hours a week and taking a full course load and she wanted to do that shit? I just told her no and she got over it after a few days.

A few weeks later I found out that she was pursuing what I wanted to think was just one sugar daddy. She tells me it was just because I am away a lot she has shit to deal with and craves feeling like something is shitty because of the depression. She doesn't feel comfortable with things so good and just does stupid stuff. She's sorry and loves me it won't happen again.

Recently I had her phone and found tinder and that led to a lot of bullshit and emotional cheating and all that Jazz. We reconcile it and she deletes it all for good and I know for a fact (have to be vague as to how) that she did delete it all and has stopped communication for a week.

Today while I was doing some work while hanging with her, I found the old convos she forgot to delete on other places today, she's met with and has sucked 3 dudes dicks, two of them for questionable things. She had told me before that she had never met any of these dudes in person. She has lied to my face for about 2 months, knowing she would be caught but not thinking about that, only focusing on the depressive feelings of being a bad person. I caught her red handed and she gave everything to me right there.


Tonight she finally saw me just break. I saw her break. I had known there was something in the background and I didn't want to believe it. We just both had a full on 2 hour long emotional collapse and rebuild. She gave her all and completely lost it emotionally before finally just collapsing there with me holding her. We just both gave it all out there with what she was feeling, how I felt about it, how mad I was.

There was one thing that whole time that I kept thinking about. I saw the messages, slammed the computer and stood up ""You've fucked other guys"".   But I didn't walk out of that door. I still love this girl. I spent two goddamn hours holding her and making sure she knew. 

As broken as she is and as hurt as she made me, I have to still love her. There is something special inside of this girl that is somewhere buried below and I can feel it. I can't let her fuck this up this easily, she is going to learn how to love herself the way I love her. My heart was completely torn, and mostly mended but the wound is healing and it's just time that I need to invest in myself and her.

I'm a fucking idiot I know. I'm a goddamn lunatic to even think that this is a fucking good idea but I love her too much. I am 100% confident in my decision to keep her with me and move forward to the good times when the stress of school is over and we have the summer and days and nights of being able to spend time with each other.

She knows at this point that I can tell when she is lying to me, it's easy, she has tells. I will know when something is up and I'm not gonna let her fucking break me down again. I'll build myself back up if I get burned. I'll learn from this whichever way she decides to let the relationship go. The success of this is honestly out of my hands as I'm putting my full effort in, and I'm waiting on her. 

I just love her.",19Apr2017,2
23,"I'm seeing this is the only really meaningful thing to do in life, i mean whatever the fuck you think you got going on in life is worth a shit, your business, your family, your relationships it's not worth anything it's all meaningless, it's all a lie that your living in, it's just a story your constructing because you've never actually experienced the beauty and joy of existence itself,  nothing can compare to it whatsoever, it's completely off the charts off the charts by orders of magnitude, so if you actually have the taste of that, then your priorities in life will shift, the problem is that you don't really buy it, you see, i could talk about it for years and you wouldn't get it, when i talk about enlightenment first half of the people will just right off the bat ignore it, even if you say you'd pursue, you'll just do it with a weak and half hearted matter, it's difficult to mobilize yourself for it because your not even sure where it'll lead you to, maybe it's all bullshit your mind will whisper around and you'll follow it, what's worse than that is you failed to realize the significance of enlightenment, this will throw your entire way of life into the garbage can, when you look at your life compared to an enlightened life, your life, your regular life whatever you love right now, whatever your trying to self actualize now your ego, it looks like a stinky pile of horse shit and this thing here looks like heaven, but even when i tell you this it's not enough, even when i had my awakening moment, you don't understand because you don't even have a frame of reference you don't even know what it's like or fathom it, because if you did fathom it you'd be doing the work, it's not enough to agree with me, that's not enough, your entire fucking life should be devoted to this because everything else is a fucking sham, but see you don't like hearing that, because your doing all this stuff, family, business, work for money and you think it matters you think it's bringing you joy and happiness, the only reason you think that is because you have nothing else to contrast you with, imagine that a human being a baby was born and was raised in a prison cell for it's entire life, you can imagine that someone who's used to their cell all their life would have it's fondness for it's prison cell and when the door was open they wouldn't even leave because what else could it know, it has no idea what's out there, it has no idea there are trees or plants or anything, (similar to Stockholm syndrome)  it has no idea what freedom is,  it has no contrast for it, your clueless your ignorant, your ignorance is so deep that i lack the language to communicate it with you, i have to be a fucking poet to communicate it to you, it's so deep, and that's the challenge of it. how do i communicate the deepest thing is possible for you? that if you experience them they would be so profound that they would bring you to your knees and tears, and yet when i tell you about these things you will not really listen to them, you will not grasp them and you will certainly not grasp them and you will die, die to your ignorance that your living in your prison cell your whole life and all the beauty in life wasn't touched, it has to be blunt, it has to be obnoxious to a degree because what else will arouse you from your fucking ignorance? what else? this is the situation it might seem like i'm exaggerating the situation, that i'm being bombastic here, and from a certain point i am but also the actual reality if you did the work to achieve the things that i'm telling you to achieve mainly no ego, non-duality, absolute truth, your true self and your true nature if you had that,  you would understand that every bombastic thing you have to say is an understatement since that's the reality, that's the depth of your ignorance and awareness at your current state of illusion, no one's going to tell you that, because if i do you'll just get defensive over every attack on your family or business or career how dare you rob me of everything and my meaning of life, that's how addicted attached you are to your nonsense, but see i mean that's a fucking farce what you call a meaningful life is a fucking joke and that's the bottom line truth, so i mean for someone to honest about these things they have to talk the way i talk they are not being honest, like go to a zen master, he's going to be silent and detached and he's experiencing the bliss of existence but he's not going to tell you that, he's not going to tell you about your ignorance, he'll just tell you sit and stare at the wall and ask yourself who and what you are, and from your perceptive that's a complete understatement, an enlightenment person doesn't really want to sell enlightenment which is kind of regrettable, i understand why they do that, why bother tell an idiot he's an idiot? why bother if the idiot doesn't listen? this challenge of humanity has been there since the start of civilization and that challenge is ignorance of what the truth is of enlightenment. there have been so many hardcore sages,yogi's for thousands of years this goes back five to ten thousand years ago, but when they come and share these insights with regular folks, regular folks are so deeply in a trance of what we call life that they can't comprehend what's being told to them, they don't hear they don't grasp the communication they dismiss it, they put it off till later they distract themselves and go back to their trance, that's all human history is in a nutshell even up till right now, and this will continue for the next years until we get some technology that will fix this problem, so yeah that's your situation with your petty life, but hey i gotta tell you how it is. the greatest gift one could have is enlightenment.",19Apr2017,0

Lost in thought, I didn't answer him right away. Three or four steps later, I realized he'd asked me a question and was probably waiting for a polite response. I answered with ""I'm doing well. I had to double check.""

28,"I'm in my first relationship (2 weeks now) with this amazing girl. We have so much in common, we laugh and get along great, and we share some similar interests. If someone said ""hey what's your ideal girl to date?"" it would look like her. I also just lost my v card to her

The thing is I have pure-o OCD (I go to therapy and take medication for it) and something about her sexual past has my OCD firing on all cylinders. She was up front with me about hooking up with her roommate (girl) last year when she was drunk and a few other girls. She claims she's not bi and that there were no romantic feelings, and that it's different between [girl] friends. The normal side of me understands this isn't an issue and that she's with me now but the OCD wont stop thinking about it for some reason. We talked about it today, and I talked about it with my therapist, and she was very open and honest with me and my therapist gave me some advice but even still I can't stop thinking about it. 

Why it bothers me? My therapist and I tried to discuss this today to not a ton of avail. Maybe because I grew up in a very Catholic home so the idea of same sex sex is kind of taboo to me, even though I'm trying to be more understanding of it. Maybe it's because the roommate is still in the picture. 

Will I ever get over it? Anyone else ever been in the same situation? I really don't want this to ruin a perfectly good relationship 

EDIT: holy shit [Chasing Amy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlYZnd7dEPw) sounds 100% like me except I don't want her to feel bad about it, I want to get over it and be happy with her ",19Apr2017,2

33,"My father once told me that my grandfather, at the age of a small boy; was playing in his openly grassy field of a yard they had surrounding their house. While out on a sunny day playing alone a bit of a distance away from his house in the grass; up drives a limousine into their property. It begins to turn closer towards him and pulls up just a small distance in front of where he stood. A man in a business suit gets out and walks towards my grandfather, he proceeds to pull something from the breast pocket of his suit and says, ""are you *insert gdad's name here*?"". The boy nodded. The man grabs the item from his pocket and hands it to him. A gold business card. The gentleman then says, ""call this number if you ever want to know who you really are"". 

Like how cool is that?

The guy gets back into the limousine and drives off. As my grandad stares at the card and the car driving away, his mother had been sprinting towards him from the house. As she approached the kid and the card, she ripped the card right out of his hands. ""Do not ever speak about this again"". She then proceeded to go back into the house with my g-dad and burn the card in the fireplace. 

Now the story gets kind of weird.

When my g-dad was much older (70's), he finds out he was kidnapped and that he had a real mom who was still alive at the time. So he writes her a letter and she reponds! They meet each other and become penpals and end up having a family reunion between the two families which I had attended without being old enough to remember why I was meeting so many new people, other than knowing I was related to them. 

Even with all that he never looked up the name on the card. He remembers it happening but never pieced the two together until much later. All he remembers on the card is the words 'Von Reeberger'. So if any of you awesome people have a cool story about how your grandfather drove a limo back in the day and worked for or is a von reeberger or any close spelling with a similar story; please share it haha, I would love to know ""who we really are!""

Many thanks for any help or comments or even that good ol' up arrow out there! ^-^

(Btw the family that he contacted was not the VRB's so I've never even met that side of the family)

35,"So last night I made plans to go to dinner and library with a friend of mine, we were to meet at 9:15. I get out of bed from reading  and begin to pack my backpack to take to the library, I took out a folder from by bag and two notebooks from my supplies drawer. I then go use the bathroom two doors down(I live hall style so we share a community bathroom) I shit the door but don't lock it like I always do. I come back not even 90 seconds later and my notebooks and folder are nowhere to be found. I looked everywhere then gave up around 9:20 to go meet my friend. After dinner we come back and look again and we find nothing. Only my folder and notebooks were taken not my laptop,  phone, wallet, kindle or anything else. I filed a report and this morning talked with the campus police. Since it was personal belonging and not a laptop and because of the timing they think that maybe someone was watching me and waiting for me to leave. I'm devastated all my notes from the semester for 4 or my 5 classes are gone and I have a test Friday and finals coming up. I'm asking peers for notes from class and teachers to see if I could get copies of the quizzes and test but I'm still upset. I honesty do not know how to deal I feel violated and the timing couldn't be worse. I've been to the counseling center, talked to people and I don't want to think about it but I have to because  I have class to go to. Idk why I'm posting but it felt good to get it out. ",19Apr2017,1
36,"I wasn't to sure where else to put this, so here I am. lol.  


Anyway, this happened a while back. Me, my brother and our parents went out to a restaurant for (I think) Mother's day. The point is that it was really crowded that day; the hostess even told us that the wait might be like 20 minutes at the most. So as time drags on, dad starts to complain (to be fair, dad's not a patient man, but this is still ridiculous). He looks around and sees that there's plenty of other empty tables to one side. So dad complains to us first.  


Dad: Look at all those free tables, why can't they sit us at one of these?  


My brother and I try to explain, saying things like:   

""Those might be reserved seats that they use for parties""   

or  

 ""They probably don't have enough servers to go around to sit us immediately.""  


Even more time goes by and dad starts complaining that we could have gotten our food faster from a cheaper fast food restaurant, and they would treat him like a king (dad has a superiority complex). He eventually gets mad enough to ask the hostess why we can't be sat at the free tables mentioned before. She mentions the shortage of servers with a polite apology.
Dad gets annoyed and steps out for a bit. It's at this point that my bother and I apologize for our father's behavior. I can't help but feel bad because the server was nothing but nice to us, and other people were waiting too. Eventually, dad comes back in and (either being ballsy or not wanting to stand up anymore) sits at the free tables until we were called to be seated.",19Apr2017,10

41,"I don't even know where to begin.

The only reason I'm posting this here is because I'm not even ready to write this out in my journal, because I know that I wouldn't be able to write another entry without reading and rereading it over and over and over again.

I don't have anyone else to talk to. All of my friends are her friends, and the only one who knows is the one who rescued her from herself while I was busy with my phone turned off.

To think that the last thing she would have ever sent was ""I wish you would had answered."" To think that I almost had to walk into our house to see dead next to a bottle of cheap vodka, unfinished homework, and an almost illegible note. With my guitar chord wrapped around her neck.

Fuck.

I am so lost. I've been so depressed my entire life. I am in constant pain that only grows worse with every passing day. I have somehow worked past my own suicidal tendencies and self-mutilation and done some amazing things.

I don't even know how to be the ""not depressed one"" in a relationship.

We can't even talk about it. I don't know how long pretending that nothing happened will remain feeling like ""the right thing to do.""

I could barely contain my anxiety attacks as it was. Now I wonder what's going through her head every second of every day. And I wonder what might be happening every second that we're apart. I took two days off of work to be with her, now I've spent my lunch break hunched over in my car chain-smoking cigarettes and asking myself how the fuck someone like me is supposed to make someone feel happy, like life is worth living.

How can I do the right thing when I barely know how to take care of myself? How can I spend the rest of my life with someone who is (apparently) more depressed than I'be been in years? 

How can I figure this out if I have no one to talk to?


Edit: Neither one of us can afford therapy at the moment. She is going to free counseling at the university, but this is a very conservative state school that does not hesitate to involuntarily commit a suicidal student. I'm sure other people have had different experiences, but I know enough people who have personally been committed for this kind of admission.

I would like to thank everyone for the kind words. This was mostly just a way to vent/prevent an anxiety attack in my car at lunch. I am not angry or resentful with my wife, and I do not love her any less. This is by far the worst thing that has happened to us, almost every other aspect and event has been an amazing experience.

56,"So recently my life's been through many changes pretty quickly. Not that I don't like them, but it'll take time to get used to the new tempo. 

One of these changes is finishing high school and going to a relatively tough university; which I have exams next week. I have my best friends with me but the fact that we have to study kinda closes the windows for celebrating tomorrow. Moreover, finishing schools means that meeting with other friends becomes more difficult; and, as an introverted guy, making new friends is not my sstrong point. Though I did make some new friends, it still isn't a strong friendship. 

One of the other changes is the fact that about two moths ago I broke up with my first girlfriend; a relationship which lasted a year and a half. Though I'm feeling better and most of the time I have something else in my mind, I sometimes get ""aftershocks"" where I feel somewhat sad. Breaking up with my girlfriend also meant a change in social circle; which is also one of the reasons for mt bittersweetness regarding tomorrow. 

In literature and stuff birthdays symbolize the passage of time. They are a reminder that time is a thing and everything changes; and mine surely does. I know these changes are positive and in the long run things will be great. But, right now, I'm feeling somewhat *(...)*.
