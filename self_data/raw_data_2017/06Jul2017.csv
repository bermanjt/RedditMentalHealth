1,"For reference we are 19 and 18 respectively. She had her last period around three weeks ago. 

I know this might not be the best place for it, but I don't know where else to go. 

She's on the pill and I pull out every time, the catch is that I found out she has been keeping her pills in the car, and is on her third month of using it. 

(For reference it's summertime in our Michigan town) I've read about heat causing them to be ineffective, and for the past week she has had nausea and she spotted a bit before that. 

Her period should be on sunday, but I need some peace of mind before then. I'm freaking out. A child is the last thing we need right now and she is highly against abortion.

What are the odds she's pregnant?",06Jul2017,4
5,"About 2 months ago my girlfriend broke up with me after about 2.5 years. She was one of the first girls I met in college and as soon as I saw her I realized that I wanted to be with her. Since then, she has been through a lot of hardships, eventually leading to her becoming depressed. I've always done my best to help her through her problems,  but now she wants to try to figure them out on her own. I respect her decision since I know what she's been through, but it just tears me up inside knowing that I can't be there for her anymore. 

On top of the breakup, my parents are in a lawsuit over my college tuition. They got divorced when I was pretty young and have since been remarried, but they have always been best friends for the majority of my life. Now it seems like they hate eachother and I feel like it's my fault. My mom also texted me today telling me she had some moles removed that tested positive for melanoma, which she had before I was born. She got them removed before they became a problem, but it's still not a good sign.

My entire life I have been happy without any effort until now. I go to a great college on an athletics scholarship, my grades have been solid  throughout school, and I have a great group of friends, but somehow I just haven't been able to be happy myself. And I feel so guilty about it because I feel like I am do lucky to be where i am, but the more i think about it the worse it gets. I don't know if I'm depressed or not, but I just wanted to talk about what's on my mind. I feel like if I talk to my friends about it they will get overwhelmed, and I don't want to put my problems on their shoulders.

Any way if you've made it this far thank you for reading this wall of text.",06Jul2017,17
9,"I got strangled by NERD THIGHS.  I got sent to the ER for going into cardiac arrest and dropping unconscious.  I am still recovering right now.  I survived the heart attack and the strangulation! Yay me!

I want to get strangled again.  This time I want it to end in my death.  I want to be *murdered* by an effeminate nerdy man.  I want him to kill me using his creamy feta cheese thighs.  I want him to have full control over each and every breath of mine.  I want him to fully take away the ability to breathe and then I'll die.

I want to take my hands and put coconut oil on my hands and rub the coconut oil on the nerd thighs.  I want to rub lots of oils on the nerd thighs (oil 'em up!).  ",06Jul2017,0
10,"I've been thinking a lot about the future and what it means to be with someone for a long time. Me and my current boyfriend have been together for over a year, and I am head over heels. I am crazy about him. We are young and in love and figuring life out together. It is an exciting time. 

I always worry for what's to come, though. How long will it last? Forever? Less? How are we supposed to know? How hard are we supposed to try? What does it mean if it doesn't work out? 

But now I am thinking, maybe it's not about knowing. It's not about being sure. It's about deciding to take a chance on someone. It's about feeling happy enough to be thankful for every day without worrying about forever. 

I find myself truly happy in this moment. I am going to be thankful for now instead of worried for later. ",06Jul2017,20
14,"21 y/o skinny male here.  My chest has been hurting for the past 4 months or so.  It's hard to describe, but it's a relatively numb pain with intensity that ebbs and tides yet is fairly consistent in it's presence. It sometimes becomes sharp and extends to my back/shoulder.  I also cannot run or exercise intensely any longer, which is disappointing because I really enjoy hiking/skiing/other sports.  It started shortly after I smoked marijuana for the first time, if that makes a difference.  

I visited the ER 3 months ago convinced that I was having a heart attack or something, and an EKG, bloodwork and chest x-ray all came up negative. The doc just told me that I'm not dying and to follow up with my primary care doc.  

Just thought I'd post to see if anyone experienced anything like this.  Obviously, I am still going to see a doctor.",06Jul2017,2

24,"My roommate and I are both in recovery from drug and alcohol addiction. He went to the doctor for mental health issues and they knew he had addiction issues. Still, they prescribed ativan(a barbituate) and now he's taken the entire 30 day script in two days. He's in the hospital now and I'm watching a friend slowly kill themself with the help of a doctor.  I hate addiction and am so upset with doctors who don't get it.

26,"I have trouble with arousal - it's hard and often just *doesn't* happen. I suspect I'm like this for a number of reasons: being on the same hormonal birth control for six years, the convenience of living with my partner, lack of romantic gestures, work stress, etc. Sometimes I get in the mood but only just barely.


Well, thanks to my day off recently, I was able to just luxuriate in exploring myself and now my libido has risen a ton! It feels so good to feel sexual, I'd forgotten what it's like to look at my husband and think ""I want this guy!""


I know this feeling won't last forever but now I know that I'm not some weirdo robot incapable of lust. I feel more liberated and happy!",06Jul2017,209
27,"I'm not going to rehash all the debates about politics and the incessant polarizing debates, but instead I'm going to focus on the attitudes and behaviors of those who identify themselves as the ""alt right"".

Succinctly, they're pussies.

I mean it.  They put forward a 'strong' face, talking about all the things they hate, calling everyone they disagree with 'cucks' and other 3rd grade playground nicknames, and then whine and whine and whine about what others are supposedly doing to keep them down.  

To which I can only say, shut up already!  You're embarrassing American men.  Probably European men too, but I'm not that so I'm sticking with my own countrymen.  

""Wah-wah-wah, my life is soo hard because of cucks and libtards and women!  I'd be soo great if I weren't being held back by globalists, foreigners, black people and jews!"" Egh, I can't believe how stupid you all are.  You're all a bunch of fucking idiots and you're tearing up a great country with all your insecure prejudiced bullshit.

What's funny is, it doesn't even really need to be said that Trump is an embarrassment to us as a nation, it's obvious on its face.  The fact that we elected such a fucking all-thumbs grade-school educated chump shows how far we've fallen. Everybody out there in the world knows how weak we have become, and it's the end of a great era.

29,"Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, they did. My foster kitten fell ill a couple of days ago and the vet gave him some medicine for his congested nose. It's been a week since but he isn't getting better. I just picked him up and saw blood coming from his nose. I've lost 3 cats in 2 years from illness so I'm extremely paranoid about anything great and small that's not normal.

I've had a bad run of luck lately so I'm already assuming the worst. This is why I can't keep people or animals near me. They either leave me or die. I've now got to be at work and worry about this kitten, hoping that one day I don't come home to see that I need to put him down because he has something that can't be treated. 

I can never just save a life. No it has to die on me. I can't look after a creature until it's healthy. No it has to get sick and die. I can never win. ",06Jul2017,1

31,"Throwaway account just because that's what people do.

So I'm a summer intern  (hoping for part-time work once summer ends) working in IT at a place I interned at last year. This year they have me on a new project they're working on, and I'm the only intern on this thing, rather than the two other interns I was with last year.

The thing about this project is that it requires me to email users to find a time to set up software on their PCs. The process of setting up this software takes virtually no time at all. Most of my job time is spent waiting around for email responses or waiting until the time someone asked me to come set up the software. I've actually done nothing today but sit around, send emails, and schedule some setups for tomorrow.

They're paying me pretty well for an intern, especially given the fact that I'm doing nothing. In addition, everyone here in IT really likes me, especially one of the guys in charge. I impressed him in my interview last year. I know pretty well what I'm doing when I'm actually doing something. 

I just feel bad because they gave me this one project to work on (coupled with some side errands from time to time) and the majority of my time is just spent sitting around. I feel like I'm just leeching money in exchange for nothing and that this project will never get done. I'm not the only one working on it (just the only intern) and I have no choice but to wait for other people, but I still feel like it's my failure. My supervisors don't give me stuff to do when I'm just sitting in the office. I feel like I should find something to do, but I have no idea what because I have no idea what else needs to be done. They haven't even given me permission to answer the support desk phone, which probably has the jobs I'm most qualified for. I'm worried they're all gonna get pissed at me sitting around doing nothing, if they even care.

Maybe this is just the dream gig? Professional redditor, I guess. But it gets very dull and I worry for my future here.

I don't know what I should do. Any advice is appreciated.",06Jul2017,3
32,"I would like to be able to make $5-$10 an hour with no initial investment whenever I need it. For example, I might decide I want to go out for drinks one day so I want to be able to pick up some job for $5-$10 and do that for a couple hours then go and drink using that money.

36,"Ugh. 

Recently I've been really enjoying the gym. The endorphins work wonders, I feel strong, confident and just good. Something that doesn't happen often.

Until today. A girl uploaded a video of her form and I was in the back ground. I've never taken videos of my form before and the mirrors at my gym are only forward facing so what you can see is limited. 

When I saw myself I just thought I look like shit. All robotic and barely hitting parallel in my squat, with the bar barely balancing on my back. I just look clumsy and flimsy. This massive long bar trying to sit on a 5ft 3 girl just looked odd. It went against everything that I feel about myself when I'm lifting. 

Now I'm just sitting in panic. What do other people think of me? I bet they think that I'm just wasting my time. That I know nothing, even though I spent hours researching what workout routines to do and what works best for my body. Suddenly I feel like the one thing that could make me feel good has been spoiled. Now I don't even want to go the gym because I feel ashamed. I don't want to walk in the doors and for everyone to look at me and be like oh look there's that brainless girl. 

I know for a lot of people this sounds like a complete over reaction but I just can't ration with this paranoia. I feel it physically crushing my chest and I'm getting more and more distressed. It's building up and I just can't get rid of it. It's like getting a fail on a test you studied so hard for, I just feel so shit. I don't want to face anyone. I feel so inferior and small. My confidence has been knocked right down once again and I'm scared to go back to the gym even though that's what managed to finally build up some of my confidence in the first place.

The last time the anxiety got to this point was when I made a rash decision to leave school. I don't like the paranoia smothering me, I just want to be comfortable in my everyday life, is that too much to ask? ",06Jul2017,1
