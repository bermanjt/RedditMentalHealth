0,"Basically I've always been telling my two brothers how its nice to share, and people don't like when someone is a cheapskate.
I'm 22 and my brothers are 14 and 12. They should be at that age where they begin to develop their mentality slowly and I am starting to get worried because they have pretty much become what I was teaching them not to be.

Whenever they are sharing stuff like candy or something they split it to equal amounts amongst eachother, including me (you could argue that I'm a old fart and I shouldn't want it but I always liked sweets)

Now where the problem lies. Even though I like candy, I am not such a fanatic for it. They indulge into those sweets like a pack of hyenas on a rotten zebra carcass. The midbro is the most okay one, he is happy with his part and usually doesn't act like a retard. The lilbro is the biggest issue. He purely acts on impulse and if he likes something sweet he will try to manipulate you into giving him some, and making this face like you're the asshole because if you have them still that means he hasn't got any even though he ate his   share instantly.  If you leave your share unattended he will eat them all, like literally mush them all in his mouth at once so there are none left. He could have just asked some extra, we'd give him, but its better to just wait for an opportunity to SEIZE THEM ALL. Midbro doesn't like this as-well and usually starts fights with lilbro because lilbro keeps being an ass and always wanting more than everyone else. Lilbro cares only about himself, which is sad and worries me... also he is a topnotch liar, I actually don't believe anything he says on principle. Most of the time I go a long with it as a meme. But when you deduct the clues there could be no-one else but him. I'm having literal sherlock irl episodes because of him.

So what does this have to do with teaching to share? Both of them have become rabid dogs about who gets more and who gets less that its sad.

I want my brothers I to be a tri-unity. So that we care about eachother and that we can always be there for one another. I've always felt that way with Midbro, but lilbro outright keeps refusing all of my love for him by being a tumor. I love him very much and I hope things change with time. Ever watched *""Supernatural""*, well that kind of brotherhood.

I've had made deals with midbro to just try to keep giving everything he wants for weeks in hope that he realizes we got less, or nothing. But he just kept taking without guild or anything even after we were acting by being sad and trying to make him understand.

This goes much deeper. My grandfather from my fathers side is the most selfish, arrogant, scheming, narcissistic piece of shit that the world splurged out. And all signs point out that lilbro is going to be exactly like him and its driving me insane. Our grandpa literally almost destroyed our entire family. I believe that some people can be born like asshole genetically from another asshole. How do I know? Because I am like this. I have the most intense in-self episodes of Lust, Greed, and self preservation that are consistent with my grandpa. I can control it because of my life experiences and view of the world, but the feeling in my Thyroid gland never disappears.

Before I finish and ask for tips, emotional support, butterfly wings I want to say that I used candy as an *example*. Even though this really happens with candy, but it happens with a lot of other stuff. But wait, what are your parents doing? They gave up. I raised myself pretty much. Jk they are pretty old and tired and don't have time to emotionally build them. You're 22 but you live with your parents? - I'm disabled and I wish I could work atleast a min wage job. They're 14 and 12, shouldn't they be a bit smarter? - Idk that is a completely another worry.

2,"I'm chronically ill, I can't work, I'm not smart. I'm creative and artistic yes but I'm not talented. I have nothing going for me. I want so badly to have that charm that beautiful women have. They don't even have to do anything, they just have to put on a dress or hell even just a nerdy t-shirt and tight jeans, and they have that magic that commands a room and draws men in like flies, effortlessly. I want to be that woman.

I'm fat and shapeless and my breasts and butt are disgustingly misshapen. I'm trying to lose the weight of course and I'm trying to be healthier. But I'm fucking poor and can't afford any fancy surgery to fix those other things, and exercise can only do so much. It will not reshape my saggy pancake tits with orange sized areolas and it certainly won't adjust their mismatched sizes (right one is a lot bigger than the left). Exercise won't get rid of stretch marks or a cellulite-ridden ass. It can help me lose this weight, but my thinner body will still be revolting.

The best that will happen to me is I'll find someone who will settle for my body, IF the guy can get past my crippling mental illnesses. 

Sex is important to me. No one short of fat fetishists will even give me a second glance, and I don't want to fuck someone who only sees me as a release for their kink. I want to fuck someone who thinks I'm truly beautiful (doesn't have to be deeper than that, although I do want love too).

Movies and TV have lied to me, I'm sure. Life doesn't revolve around sex and beauty. But for now, it does to me. But it's a dream I'll never achieve. ",29Apr2017,30
4,"... how happy you make me, and how much pain you bring me.


I don't understand how you can all of the sudden start dating someone right in the middle of our extremely close friendship and say that ""it's only going to last three weeks"" because you don't feel any sort of emotion or commitment to it. And then, how can you tell me that he's a wonderful person, several weeks past the ""three weeks"" it was supposed to last, and say ""you and him are almost the same exact person."" How then do you tell me that you love me, come party with me and crash in my bed in my dorm, several times, and not realize what's right in front of you? Does your man even know anything about me? We hang out more than you see him!


You make me want to be the best person I possibly can and you've changed my life for the better in the five years I've known you. You've given me motivation when I was down, lifted me from my rut, and proved to me that my life has meaning. Someday I hope to help you realize your potential too. I want to see if maybe I can change your life, but you're too blind to see that feelings don't have a clock, nor do they need to rely on convenience. After I poured my heart out to you, you told me that you were hoping that I felt that way, and that you were happy because *you felt that way too* and that ""maybe sometime in the future things can fall our way."" And now, by stringing me along like this, it's absolute torture. 


I hope that something will make you see how much I care about you even though you cause me pain. How can you say you don't want to be in a relationship with someone, yet you've dated a ""better"" version of me for three months, when even you yourself were skeptical of the longevity of the relationship. You even told me that he ""talked you into it"" and it's pretty much ""a convenient relationship is all."" 


I just don't understand.

5,We'd been together a year on Sunday. I know it was the right move but I feel like a pile of shit,29Apr2017,4
9,"Yep this post will contain whining and self pity. So we have been married 17 years, our marriage was one born in turmoil and a death of a child from her first marriage. We have been through hell and back. We have withstood it. We have had hot and cold times. Sex life has been good when we are active, but is one of our core issues. We have a 6 year age gap, me being older than her. When we started living together she bitched lightly that we werent having sex often enough. When we did I was frequently told it lasted too long. 

I would have probably tried more often but for me getting things started with her has always been near impossible. She isnt much of a kisser, she just isnt into it. So that is one thing taken away from foreplay. She insists that foreplay is all my job, at least until I get her to the point she is unwilling to stop. Getting to that point fails better than 50% of the time. Even before other issues have come up. Over our first 10 years we discovered I was low in testosterone, so started supplementing that. That gave me extra energy and things improved, then like some fellas my age started having a bit of other issues in the bedroom, fine there are meds for that. Unfortunately they are expensive as hell $6/pill so its not something you just take every day (not counting the side effects of headaches and seeing the world with a blue tinge). Still, I would take a pill then make a pass, seduction success fell to about 25%. So with each failed attempt my desire to try fell. We were  down to getting busy 2-3 times a month, then the few times we got busy i started having more issues. I am fat and out of shape, no excuses its surely part of the issue. Over the past 2 years even attempts have become non existent because I take the pills and an hour later I hear she doesn't feel good or is tired etc. Now she doesn't know i am taking the pills when I do because she told me that knowing kills the romance. It just works out that way. So I dont even start foreplay. So sex life non existent. Then he comes into the picture, her Xbox.

We got the kid an xbox one, she didnt like it much so I started playing it, wife liked it so we both played it. Then she found neverwinter and poof, she is addicted. She plays so much I convince her to buy another unit. She plays 8+ hours in our bedroom on the average day. So much so that she shuttered her retail business. She doesnt just play the games she enjoys the socializing with others, thats the main attraction for her. She (imho) actively tries to hide me. If I tell her something about one of the games she plays she tells her friends and represents it as her info. She mutes the mic whenever I am around etc. I find it a bit offensive but wasnt something worth picking a fight over till lately. 

Now here play group has shrunk. She mostly plays with this one other married guy. She whispers to him. What fucking reason would a married woman have to be whispering to another married person. I know he has a fucked up marriage because I get to hear all about it. 

Then one month I am paying bills and notice one of her CC that I pay but dont monitor close, the balance ad payment have gone up. I see its an $84 charge from Amazon, figuring its our prime membership renewing I check her account and no, its a remote control pair of vibrating panties. The kind you can control from anywhere with an internet connection. Then last night when she was playing with her friend and she thought I was napping in the living room, I heard her getting off. Suddenly it all click s in place, why she hates me working from home and being home and god forbid I walk into our own bedroom. The shit looks I get..

Anyway wasnt looking for advice or anything I know its partly my fault, I just need to commit to doing something to change things, unfortunately between the two of us is a wonderful 15 year old girl... Ugh. We seperate or get divorced and it will tear her apart. 

Thanks for letting me vent. ",29Apr2017,338
10,"So my partner is on a megabus from Nyc to Washington DC. It was suppose to arrive at 1230am. It wasn't an ideal time but I really really want to see my partner. So she gets on and gets cozy. She then sends me a message that they are stopping in Baltimore. Well theta wasn't on the listing when we booked but it should only be a short stop. So they stop in Baltimore and the drive says there will be another driver getting on in about 10 mins. 30 mins go by and no driver. 20 more minutes no drive and a megabus rep gets on and says that don't have any drivers currently and they are working on finding another one. He gets back on 10 mins later and says it might be between an hour to two hours before another driver is there. People (including me from the D.C. Bus stop) are getting pissed as fuck. 15 mins later, a driver from the other bus that just pulled up gets on and says he will be driving them to D.C. and it's going to take an hour to get here. So now the bus is stupid late, my partner is crying from being tired and I still have an hour drive ahead of me when they get in so I can take her to where we are staying. I can do the drive. I'm not tired. But what I am is pissed. I have spent so much time away from my partner because of the navy and it seems every time we try to get together some company is fucking with us and making it Nth times more difficult. So today, fuck you MegaBus. From the bottom of my highly caffeinated body, go fuck your self with a goddamn nonskid dildo.

12,"Hi, I am in need of some advice regarding a possible hallucination induced by opioids such as endone and tramadol. I broke my leg and shattered my ankle last year in October and was prescribed a healthy dose of opioids to deal with the pain amongst some other medications. I think it is important to note that I was also smoking a medium to heavy amount of marijuana at the time and was a smoker prior to my accident. During this time I was immobile at home requiring my girlfriend to attend to me and be around pretty much all the time. During this time, something incredibly fucked up may have occured which I may have been witness to. 

To elaborate, I have a memory from that time that I am certain happened, but have been told that it didn't. My memory involves waking up in the middle of the day to find myself alone in my room. Now I have to stress that I can remember almost every detail of that day and my surroundings. Normally my gf would be there reading or entertaining herself as I would slip in and out of sleep because of all the drugs. She wasn't around so I decided to try and find her. Having a cast on, I could only get around on crutches at a very slow pace, also important to note. I checked the toilets of the sharehouse I live in (I live with 4 other people) and she wasn't there and not in any of the other shared rooms like the kitchen etc. After this initial search, I thought I would check with my housemates to see if they knew where she was. I knocked on my housemates door, let's call him Pete, and after being told to wait and hearing some rustling of sheets I entered. Pete had some friends staying at the time as well and they were situated on a couch and Pete was in bed with the covers pulled up to his chest. I noticed what could have only been a body curled up at the foot of the bed under the sheets. It was obvious I had walked in on some form of orgy involving some or all of them. After questioning who was under the sheets, they told me it was no one I knew and I shouldn't worry. I didn't accept this and demanded to see who it was. After some back and forth he agreed to show me the hair colour of the person who was there. He flipped to covers up a few times in quick succession giving me some view of the person's hair, which was long curly and dark redish dyed. This is the colour of my girlfriend's hair but the view I had was somewhat blocked and incomplete so I couldn't be sure. After being told that it wasn't her, I left the room and a horrible thought occured to me. 

 I still wasn't convinced so I re-entered and  asked again to see who it was. They didn't agree so I made a dive for the bed and tried to grab the sheets away, dropping my crutches in the process. I managed to grab the person around the waist and tried to wrestle away the sheets from this person. As this was happening, the sheet was pulled around my head to cover my eyes and was held around my head. After screaming to let me go they finally let go and I was helped back to my crutches. When I got up, only Pete and his two mates were in the room. The girl may have already left the room or be hiding in his closet. Important side note is that Pete has two doors in his room, one leading to the rest of the house and one leading to the entry hallway. At this point the guys asked me to leave and thinking she had left and quite distraught I agreed. As I was walking out the door I heard his other door open, the one to the rest of the house. I lunged forward on the my crutches and only managed to see the leg and shadow of someone running through the adjacent living area. I also remember the door shutting once I entered into this area. After a few tears and the realisation dawning on me of what had just happened, I decided to make my way to my gf to confront her. I found her walking up the hallway from the toilets, she was sweating and red faced. I asked what the fuck had just happened and she insisted that she wasn't in there. After some confused arguing I agreed that it wasn't her and that's sort of where the memory ends. This is my dilemma as I'm not sure if it was a dream/hallucination or it actually happened. At the time I was extremely zoned out on these drugs so I guess I was far more easily persuaded about the event hence my ability to disregard what happened. Also why I was so subdued with following it up. 

I have had dreams about this event which has fragmented my memory of it as well as other possible memories of people approaching me and telling me it happened. I have relived it a number of times in my dreams. I am now at this point unsure of what I have dreamt and what I think actually happened. 

I know the obvious answer that this was a paranoid deluison/dream caused by the excessive combination of opioids and weed. I have looked into this a bit and while they're is some anecdotal evidence of hallucinations from this combination, I feel this wasn't the case as the memory was a complete event not just a noise or voice. I remember every detail in my mind's eye including the light, weather and even the weight of the crutches. I have brought this up with her quite a number of times after the initial confrontation in the hallway and each time she becomes defensive, telling me I probably dreamt it and that I need to get over it. Each time we have discussed she has become increasingly defensive and has all the hallmarks of lying. He is the same way when I have approached him about it. I initially I recall him saying it definitely wasn't her and more recently he told me that he didn't have anyone over in that time frame. It feels like both of them are lying about it. Because of this drug combination I was on and the amount of time that has passed since then (4-5 months) I am having a lot difficulty remembering what happened.

I have become extremely paranoid about all of this and have had symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, depression and full blown panic attacks. My mental health has only detoriated since this event. I am now concerned that these symptoms could possibly be leading to some serious conditions and I'm a male in my mid 20s so this may trigger my promodal phase of schizophrenia. It may also be a psychotic break caused by opioid withdrawal. The event and what happened has become completely fixating for me and I have had increasingly an inability to differ my dreams from reality. 

The advice I need; 

1. What is people's opinion on this? What is the likelihood it was real or a hallucination/dream
2. How to approach her and Pete (if true) and convince her to tell me? 
3. I also believe they filmed portions of it, including me walking in, as I have memories of people telling me they saw it on Snapchat or elsewhere online. If anyone has seen an amatuer 3-4 person sextape involving a black guy, white guy with long brown hair,  white tall guy with long curly fro (Pete) and my gf who is skinny, white, big tits and  brown-redish wavy hair and possibly me walking in on crutches and being very confused about everything.

21,"Hi everyone, this is going to be an annoyingly long post, sorry in advance!!

I posted about my situation on r/relationships a month ago and got some great advice but the post was removed and I was told to post on r/self instead so here goes.

I'm 21, have been with my boyfriend for 2 and a bit years. I moved cities to be with him and go to uni a year ago. I have struggled with anxiety and depression since my mid-teens, and have yet to find adequate support for that (trying to find a therapist rn). I also grew up with a mother who had anger management issues and would sometimes verbally abuse me (sometimes, very very rarely, physically as well). 

My current dilemma is that I think my relationship is unhealthy but I don't know how to convince myself to leave and keep rationalising it as capable of improving and being too scared to walk away.

My boyfriend is caring and supportive - he surprises me with random gifts, helps me when I'm feeling down, supports me through my bouts of anxiety/depression, takes care of me when I'm sick, plans nice things for us to do together, has the same sense of humour as me, wants to eventually settle down together, possibly have children, and I trust him completely. In all these respects, and many more, he is the nicest guy and a great partner. 
Unfortunately, he has some difficult family circumstances and a history of depression which results in him having mood swings every so often (maybe fortnightly on average, sometimes more) which he takes out on me in the form of name-calling me (bitch, slut, disgusting pig etc), getting upset and making me feel like I'm not good enough over small things (not changing the channel quickly enough when he asks me too, forgetting to think ahead to buy him tissues for when he had a cold (we don't live together and he didn't ask me to do that but I should've remembered to)). In situations where he feels I'm not good enough he'll make comments like 'you just don't know how to look after me', 'you don't know me as well as other gfs know their boyfriends', 'you don't support me enough/do enough for me'. He also very frequently makes passive aggressive comments about my sexual history (I kissed 5 guys I met in clubs before him and dated one for a month) - whenever there's a 'slutty' character in a tv show he'll get upset at me because she reminds him of what he thinks I was like, if I bring up things tangentially related to sex/relationships he'll often spin it back to how I was a 'slut' (e.g. I told him my friend was engaged despite being quite young and he said she probably believes more in love than I do, because I can't have that big a belief in love if I kissed guys without caring about them/knowing them beforehand). This happens maybe weekly, and when I ask him to apologise he rarely does, because he says it's just a fact that I was a slut. He said he would stop saying these things if I apologised for doing the things I did, but I refused to because I did them before I knew him and they never hurt anyone so I considered it unfair that I should accept that I was somehow deficient or shameful for doing something quite normal. Also, he hates my mum because he always wanted to have a good mother-in-law and he deals with this by making mean/sexual jokes about her despite me telling him it makes me really uncomfortable.

Over the past week we've been having conversations about these issues and we kind of broke up for a bit because he said he's done everything he could to be a good partner and he didn't have anything more to give in response to me asking him whether he'd be able to find ways to cope with difficult situations that didn't involve taking it out on me in hurtful ways. After a night during which we were kind of broken up, he told me he'd been planning to do more activities with me that I liked and being more accepting of my mother (although he explicitly said he wouldn't stop with the mean/sexual comments that made me uncomfortable), as well as that he had been planning to introduce me to his parents and move in with me soon. Most importantly, he said he was going to find some ways to relax that would deal with his anger issues (he mentioned photography). He still refuses to seek out therapy. Being with him that night after not seeing him for two weeks reminded me of how good it felt to be together and how much I loved being around him, so I said we should try to work on our issues instead of straight out breaking up. He also communicated with me some things he'd been frustrated with about me - I have trouble apologising for things straight away, and he felt I wasn't trying hard enough to support him with the family issues he's been having. He said I should have tried to get him to do more activities and do fun stuff with him, but I didn't know he would enjoy that because he's always told me he enjoyed staying at home chilling which is what I did with him most of the time (at my place, and I would always buy him snacks he enjoyed etc). It seems that he's not very good at communicating his needs/wants to me in a clear way, because although I talked to him about his family issues and tried my best to do stuff he enjoyed with him he never brought up that I wasn't doing enough in his opinion. I want to try get better at doing this, and maybe if I get better at that and apologising and he handles his mood swings better, we can keep all the beautiful happy parts of our relationship (of which there are so many).

My concern is that he still seems to think that I'm ungrateful because I'm unwilling to put up with the negative things I described above in return for him doing lots of nice things for me. For him, it's a balance thing, and I'm focusing too much on the negative and being ungrateful by putting too much focus on those things. I think he has a deeply engrained belief that it's normal for long term relationships to descend into the kind of fights/issues I've described. But he also seems to be willing to work on it. However, I've been asking him to deal with these issues for over a year. I don't know whether he can actually improve it or if it's important to him. Also, I finally apologised for being a slut and said it was mistake because I was desparate to have him back. He says he won't continue with calling me a slut anymore, because he was only doing it to try get an apology from me. 

So I feel like maybe we've had these difficult conversations and we can grow as a couple from here? I really really don't want to give up all the good things about our relo, he always says I won't find anyone as caring as him and I'm afraid that might be true. A happy future with him is very seductive but there's a small voice inside me that says I'm holding out too much hope that he'll change. But maybe I should just learn to cope with the things he does and be grateful for the good things like he says? I do have a tendency to focus on the negative, and I'd hate for that to ruin a great relationship. 

Please let me know what, if any, advice you may have for me, and what I should do! I'm reaching out here because I've bothered my best friend with these issues too much and I don't have access to a therapist rn and I'm kind of desperate. I would be so so grateful for any help/comments you can provide! Apologies again for the length.

22,"my quality of life is being ruined by tics

ever since I was in fourth grade I had a habit of picking at the skin on my fingers, now they look disfigured and it's the first thing people notice about me

then when I entered college I developed a jaw clenching tic and developed TMJ. I stopped the jaw clenching tic afterwards but the TMJ stayed.

Around the same time, I developed an ear popping tic where I pop my ears every 20-30 seconds or so by widening the back of my mouth.

Now recently I've developed a hard blinking tic where I blink hard every 5-10 seconds, and occasionally clench my jaw while doing it.

I feel like a fucking mess. At any given moment I'm simultaneously blinking hard, clenching my jaw, popping my ears, and/or picking at the skin on my fingers. I just want peace of mind for a change. People around me think I'm anxious all the time but I'm like this even when I'm relaxed.

26,"So up until yesterday I worked at a daycare. The pay sucked, but I loved my kids (I worked with babies under a year) and my coworkers were pretty cool. Management was kind and helpful except for one lady but it turned out nobody liked her so after I told management that I found her very unhelpful and unsupportive, and she started bullying me specifically, and I complained of discrimination to hr, we all reported her and she stopped. 

But before that she hired the worst employee ever. Falls asleep on the job, flat out says she doesn't want to help when asked to do her job, refuses to listen to criticism because she raised two children. My relationship with her turned south when she lifted a baby by the arm and made her cry. She did it again with another baby shortly after, she grabbed him by the arm and yanked when I tried to take him with me, and though it didn't leave a mark he did cry in pain. 

So I informed mnagement, including corporate HR. They essentially did nothing. They said it was my word against hers and that she was going to stay in the infant rooms until they found a place to move her. I finally told them that I refused to be held liable for her actions, so if she was in infants, in danger of hurting my kids again, then I was not comfortable working and would be going home. They let me on day one, but when I said the same thing on day two (because she was still there) they called and yelled at me, said I had a ""bad attitude"" for trying to ""dictate who they put where"" and that I had zero chance of being promoted like I wanted because my behavior was ""crazy"". I told her that I didn't feel the kids were safe and she hung up to call HR. HR called and implied that with this and the manager complaint I was causing too much trouble, they said that it was my word against hers, they didn't see her as a danger to the babies, they didn't even think that what she did qualified as ""hurting"" him because t didn't leave a mark, and they said if I didn't show up and do my job they would consider that a ""voluntary resignation"" Then the district manager called and gave me a bunch of crap for not reporting this to licensing - which I had never been advised to do during any of this, and never knew I had to - and said she would do it and pull the video (up until now I was told there was no video, it's. LivestreM that doesn't record). I figured they were trying to throw me under the bus, so on Friday at the end of the day I told them I wasn't coming back. They tried to get me to sign a resignation and threatened to say I was guilty of ""job abandonment"" if anyone ever cLled for a reference, and that's I had already ""abandoned"" my job two days in a row; I refused to sign and walked out.

My question is, what now? She did hurt a child and yet is still there, I think I might be liable if I tell the parents that she hurt a kid, but I could call licensing. I think I have grounds for a lawsuit, but I'm not sure. Overall I just want the kids to be safe, and I'm not convinced that they are. What do you think, Reddit?",29Apr2017,2
30,"I go to Perkins a lot, but I've never had an experience like I just did. In the booth next to me was a father and his young daughter. The waitress came up to them and said the elderly man who just left (I never saw him) had already paid for their meal. The father was beside himself. His daughter asked if anyone had ever done that for him, and he replied no. She said they should do it too and lo and behold, he asked the waitress to pay for MY ticket! I picked up a crayon his daughter had dropped on the floor earlier, that's probably why! I, too, was beside myself and decided to pay for a random old man's ticket when I left. I don't know if anyone else did it after that, and I left before seeing any reaction from that old man, but I feel like I was part of a really good moment today. 

Tl;dr - someone paid for someone else's meal at Perkins. That someone then paid for my meal. I then paid for a stranger's meal and it's a good day.",29Apr2017,25

33,"My earliest memory is a dream. Well two actually, but let's keep it simple. I find myself, in the nightgown my Mom made for me. I am standing on top of the Earth next to a big metal pole.  Everything is 2d and zoomed out. The earth floats in sparkly black ocean. 

I'm on the top. I'm a freaking giant. Suddenly, the Earth begins to roll over, so I grab onto the pole. There is a second metal pole jutting from the bottom of this 2d Earth. Next thing I know I'm dangling from the pole I grabbed, but now at the bottom of the planet, instead of the top. The poles flipped. I couldn't hold on and fell into the pitch black.

Several terrifying seconds of free fall later, I land on a mirrored platform in the middle of space. On this platform is a very old woman on a rocking chair. She tells me a story and I wake up. Safe in my bed. This dream recurred every single night, from my 2nd birthday until my 21st birthday. I never could remember what story the old woman told me.

Around this time I ""met"" my imaginary friend. Her name was Loki. (I was a toddler in a hippy home. No tv, no crazy mythologies or the like.) she had waist length chestnut hair and huge dark eyes. She got me into alot of trouble. She vanished on my 5th birthday. Also the day my last remaining Grand Parent died. I mourned them both, though my pop-pop made a couple of ghostly appearances through out the years.

I was considered a musical prodigy, an artistic genius, a spiritually mature child. One of the first Star or Crystal children. Yeah no. It's all evolution and autism. I couldn't grasp time or read a clock until I was an adult. I still can not grasp even the most basic math. Yet I can learn any other language in a matter of days. Literally. 

So toddler me. Full of doomsday prophecy, but one hell of an ear/eye. WCGW?

Everything. Everything went wrong and that ball has just kept rolling. 30 years this ball has been rolling down-hill. We'll get onto those tragic course of events in the next post, detailing the bizzare existence I have called a life.

38,"Baby-Sitters. Nannies. Au Pairs. The old crack-head down the street. The crazy church lady. Whatever you want to call it. Early life, when my parents needed a break, it never went smoothly.

I never was nor ever will be anything. Ever. Anyone can hold a title if enough people believe in them.

39,"Here's a quick little story, and I'm open to any advice as my search continues. 

When I was in the 7th grade I was quite the social outcast. This would have been in the late 90's and I was super into bands like Korn and didn't fit in at my super rural redneck/cowboy school. That is until I met Richie. 

Richie was just like me. He wore metal band shirts, kept his hair long, and played hackey sack every spare minute he had. In all of our pubescent angst, we hit it off immediately and were best friends very quickly. 

Richie as it turned out was just recently adopted by his aunt. His father was long out of the picture and his mother was a decades long crack user. He often jokingly referred to himself as a ""crack baby."" After being a ward of the state and bouncing around the foster home system in Michigan, he finally found a family member to take him in. This was to be short lived however. His aunt had little tolerance for a boy that was already maladjusted by the life he had lived to that point. She gave up custody of him only after a few short months. 

But those months were long enough that he got to know my family well. He had stayed the night all the time anyway. My gracious mother decided to pluck him out of the system and legally adopted him. This wouldn't be really for the best as we were both negative influences on each other, but it seemed the good idea at the time. 

About a year passes before he gets into a fight with another kid in our neighborhood and pulled out a BB gun. He ended up shooting this other kid in the foot. The parents threatened to press assault charges and felt scared for their son (regardless of his own guilt in the situation) and forced the hand of my parents to once again send Richie back into the system. 

After that Richie went back to a life of bouncing between foster homes in the outer reaches of suburban Detroit. (Note: not the nice suburbs either.) We kept up correspondence for a little while after that between phone calls and letters. Once I was 17 and old enough to drive I even visited him at one of the foster homes. 

It was made incredibly clear to me, that life in this system was hell. He was one of many kids, nameless and faceless. I would say it's only one step up from being in jail. 

Shortly after that Richie became unavailable. No more phone calls, no more letters. Life continued on for me as I transitioned into adulthood. I hoped that he would one day get onto social media. There is no MySpace page, no Facebook, no online presence whatsoever. His full name is Richard Domogala, and fairly uncommon name for sure. Outside of a few pictures I still have it's like he never existed at all. I have zero contact information for any of his relatives or friends he might have had. 

I'm 30 now and I still think about him all the time and wonder what became of him. The only thing I do know thanks to Google, is that apparently he died on December 3rd, 2012. I have no idea what the cause of death is or how he spent his last years. Maybe I don't want to know. But if I never find out I will always wonder what happened to that strange kid who lived with me and dared to be my friend.",29Apr2017,522
40,"Now this is a strange story, and where a normal strange story would be expected to end this one truly began. 

The night started off with me playing tug of war with my Husky, he got the toy and I tried to take it back, and through a series of unfortunate circumstances (he wasn't looking at me when I tried to take it, my head was pretty close to his, and I was sitting on the floor), his bite, which I believe was intended to be a warning nip, like dogs do with each other, however when it made contact with an ear, it did a bit of damage. 

First step was to get to an urgent care, and there's one a little less than half a mile away, so I call an Uber. But the urgent care won't do stitches on ears. Also, apparently my ear needs stitches. 

Next step was calling another Uber to get to the ER to get stitches. I get there and get into a room in about half an hour. Someone comes in, cleans the wounds, and determines I'm not the highest priority in the ER right now and the wait begins. Someone brings me a warm blanket, straight out of the drier. Warm blanket man is my favorite person in that hospital right at that point. I was having a crappy night and he brought a warm blanket. 

Stitches go in without issue. Then the doc gives me:

* a set of forceps

* some tweezers

* an ounce of iodine 

* some saline 

All from the suture kit she used on me and she didn't want to throw them away and they couldn't just clean them and reuse them. Cool.

 I now have to call the Third Uber. This is where it gets weird again. My phone is pretty low, but I try anyway, and my phone died right as I got the pop-up about the Uber being called. Close call. 

He arrives in a sub-par car for an Uber driver, missing a headlight, smells like cigarettes, and has some trash. Shortly before we get to my street police pull my driver over. He doesn't have his license, he claims its at work and gives his name, date of birth, and social security instead, and they run it. 

The police come back and ask him to step out of the car, and start patting him down. Then put his hands behind his back, and cuff him. From what I overheard he had a warrant for his arrest, and his license had been suspended. Which explains why he didn't have it. So they arrest him, and while they process it and everything I am left thinking I'm gonna have to walk home at around 10 at night. After the night I had I'm not sure I'd make it. We're not far by car, but walking would have taken 20-30 minutes and my phone was dead. An officer comes up to my window, tells me what going on and he offers me a ride. Thank god. I just have to ride in the back of the cruiser. 

At that point I get home and internally celebrate the end of that insane night. 

Special thanks to Warm Blanket Guy and the Officer who drove me back.",29Apr2017,36
41,"I only ever knew her as Miss Mae. She was half Japanese and half Hawain. Before she came to America, she was a Doctor. After immigrating, she became a maid.  She decided she was too old to start over. The schooling too much. Already In her late 40s, it would be time to retire, by the time she was up to American snuff.

I always found it unfair. Especially in the late 90s, when the laws began to change. So what's it got to do with appropriation and magical trees that bloom lollipops?

44,"Hey. I'm weirdly anxious about this whole thing. I should be happy about it, but I also get shaky and scared, and I think it's because it happened way before I expected it. 

For context, I'm sixteen, (a sophomore) bisexual, and female. I get anxious easily, I prefer suits over dresses, and I have a crush on this girl Jay, who's pansexual and a senior.  

So here's the whole story:

We were on the fencing team together, and we got close during tournaments. We were flirting and joking around, but I didn't expect it to go farther than that. 

Wednesday after school, I was playing truth or dare in this big group of friends, of which Jay was in the circle. When it was my turn, someone asked me if I had a crush on someone in the circle. Without thinking, I say yes. 

Then on Friday, I see Jay, again after school. We get to talking about nothing in particular, but then she asks who in the circle I have a crush on. I try to dodge the question, but she isn't having it. Finally, I fess up thinking she'll let me down easy. But she doesn't. 

She doesn't outright say that she's returning the feelings (which I do need to ask about next time I see her), so I don't know what she wants from this. But she does say that she doesn't have anyone to go to prom with and would be happy to go with me. (which, I believe, is a month or so away). 

So she leaves and I'm flipping shit. I gotta figure out what I'm going to do. 

**Does she like me? Does she just wanna go as friends? Are sophomores allowed to go to prom?** I'll have to look into that. 

**Do I really wanna go?** I feel like anxiety is clouding my judgement about whether I'd like to go. I also dunno how much fun it would be. I don't think a lot of my friends are going to prom, and I don't want to smother Jay the whole time. 

**Would my parents let me go?** My parents are kind of strict about this. They do know I'm bisexual (or at least, they should. I told them about a year ago, they seemed to understand. They haven't brought it up since, though). 

**What's the dress code? What am I gonna wear?** I haven't told my parents that I want to wear suits in general. I think my dad already knows, but I doubt my mom knows (and I don't think she'd like the idea). I also don't know where or how I'm gonna get a suit that would look good on a girl. I'm not super curvy, but my body definitely isn't masculine. I don't think my parents are going to drop a lot of money on this. 

**What about my extended family?** A lot of them don't know that I'm bisexual, but that's easily remedied by saying we're just going as friends. I might tell my parents about the actual situation if I find that Jay likes me back, but any sort of relationship we might have wouldn't last long because she's a senior.

I just don't know. I feel a little bit better having all my concerns out, but I dunno. Of course, there's also the idea of just going out somewhere different with her instead of prom, which kind of puts me more at ease. Thank you for reading this far, if you did, and if you have any suggestions I'd love to hear them.

45,"So Ms. Mae. Middle aged, new to America and looking to pay the rent. My mother. Old school Scottish, a new mother with a husband on the up and up.

Not sure how, but they bonded. This is important for future events not related to the lollipop tree. However.....

I was now 2 turning 3. It was Halloween and my church provided pre-school was celebrating.

Nothing better than dunking for apples and a good ""witch effigy"" burning to get those Christian Juices flowing. Am I right folks? (Said the psychos) ANYWAY, my athiest Mother decided to blatantly thwart the church.

Using her ""genius"" toddler, and the soft spoken Japanese Physician she had just ""hired"" as a ""maid"" Fun fact: Mae tried to clean once. My mother insisted she study instead. Dust don't care and it's not going anywhere. Women doctors on the other-hand....

It was a nice dream. In the mean time, a girl from the Baltimore Ghettos had to guss up her toddler for Halloween. So the society wives would back off.  She was new to this, so she vented to the Dr. turned housekeeper. Who happened to have grand-daughter of the same age. With a multitude of donated traditional garb.

The only thing missing, were a pair of sandals. Which were stitched last minute.

Mae got hired, I went to day-care and my Mom won the neighborhood. But how about that Lollipop Tree? Never once mentioned except for the titles?

So. The Lollipop Tree. It was an ANCIENT Willow. Huge, gnarled, roots that grow up, branches that grow down, weird smells and ghosts if you're keen on that sort of thing.

The land it grew on housed the local church and pre-school. Our Pre-K teacher spent Moving Night, tying suckers to the multitude of branches on the Willow Tree. Thing is, halfway through she was violently murdered and carried out into the woods.

No one knew. My mom and her new friend dressed me up in tradional Japanese Ceremonial Garb. Dropped me off with the rest of the class. There wa a new teacher and we would be outside today. For every question answered, we got to pluck a Tootsie Pop out of the Willow. 

There were hundreds of Tootsie Pops hanging from this tree. Towards the end of the day men in suits showed up......
