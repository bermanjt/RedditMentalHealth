2,"From monday to friday every time I take the bus from highschool to my house i see this girl (from my same school) taking the same bus. After a long time I started to having a crush on her. I want to talk to her but I have a few problems to do it.
First, I'm 17 and i'm pretty sure she is between 14-15yo so I think the age gap will make my friends and parents not look at me with the same eyes, although i look younger than i really am.
Secondly, because I'm a introvert pussy, i find very hard to talk with another person without a reason and I think it would be worst in a bus with all the people listening what I could be saying to her.
What do you think? How could I start a conversation with her without looking like a creep? Do you think the age gap is really important?

3,"I just just can't conceptualise how they work in my mind at all. It makes me feel so *damaged* that I just don't understand how they can work. I know what it's like to feel desire for someone on either or both of a physical or emotional level, but I just have this huge mental block around how that would translate into an actual relationship.

It's all levels of them that I don't 'get'.

People around me in relationships seem to be constantly talking to their other half, which is something I don't get. I really struggle to talk to people over long periods of time - I just end up feeling like it's going in loops all the time. I just can't imagine what it is like to have someone talking to you all the time about everything - in my mind I just see them getting bored of the same conversations every day.

And then the 'standard' relationship involves so much physical affection. Realistically I'm probably some degree of asexual, or maybe just cripplingly insecure, or just a very passive non-assertive person in general, but I just don't get it - I just can't picture how I would ever go from  (say) not-kissing someone to kissing them. Like in my mind if I try and picture it now it goes:

1. Doing something unrelated
2. ???
3. Kissing someone

I just can't fill in the gap. It's not even really a lack of desire, it's just I don't understand how this is supposed to work. Nothing I can imagine fits in properly and it all just feels *wrong*, like it's not supposed to happen.

I just don't understand how everyone seems to just be able to do this, even people who are objectively less emotionally mature than me. Everyday you can go on here and other places and see the stories of people who seem able to just make it work despite any number of character flaws and I just can't. I know people IRL who are diagnosed autistic even and they seem to just be able to go along with a relationship somehow and I just can't even begin to imagine how it works

I don't think I'm (fully) asexual or that I'm the kind of person who is disinterested in having a relationship, I just don't feel I can grasp what it means to be in one. And I'm a sufficiently cautious and reserved person that I always shy away from things I don't understand I guess.

And part of me really does want to have one, if nothing else just so I can try and understand why everyone seems to have such a fascination with them. But that's a terrible reason on its own (imagine how you would feel if someone treated you like that!) And I can't tell if that's more of my motivation than, say, the occasional wistful sadness I get from going to sleep and waking up in an otherwise empty bed.

But, what's even the point of my life if I'm just going to die alone because my mind is just set-up to make the deepest human connections impossible? Do I just keep going to work every 9-5 5 days a week until I die without any real meaning to if all? Or do I just blindly jump in and trust that it'll all work out in the end?",08Oct2017,0
5,"This is my wake up call. I'm finished being passive about everything. I'm finished letting depression run my life. I'm finished hiding from my problems.

7,"So I kind of feel a little too easily discouraged at times. To explain what I mean I'll start with the fact I'm currently in school learning game development, with my main focus being programming.

I would like to get into art, mainly to be a bit more flexible in the field (and also to draw my own characters and concept art) but I've never been a good drawer, I always thought it was a talent you had to be born with, not something you could achieve with practice. But I still wanted to at least try to learn, I live in a rural area that doesn't have art classes (besides the college I'm at but I couldn't take any this semester) but my friend told me about art courses on Udemy. Him and I started the same course, because he was pretty confident in it and I knew, like me, he wasn't the best drawer in the world, so I purchased the course and one of the first assignments was to follow along with the video to draw an eye (it was basically meant to be a starting point, you draw the eye now as a beginner, then draw it at the end of the course to show how much you've improved) at the end of the video the instructor's eye looked amazing and mine was...well..awful. Naturally I got super discouraged and kind of wanted to stop, but I figured if my friend could do it I could too. So I asked him if how his eye drawing turned out and he sent a picture of..as happy as  I was for him..a bit of self doubt rose up in me when I saw that his eye was almost as good as the instructor's. 

When I compared my work to his as well as the instructor's, I felt there really was no point in me continuing on with it, it clearly was a talent and I didn't have it. But I soon began thinking a bit more positively, that maybe I could do it, I just shouldn't compare myself to others. The more I do the course though, and the more my work never turns out like the instructor's the more discouraged and disinterested I get, I always fall back into the pattern of comparing myself..which leads back to me bringing my confidence back up and trying again..which leads back to comparing, and it is just a constant spiral.

I know I'll never get to the spot I want to be at being stuck in a loop like this but I can't seem to pull myself out of it. 

Although I have a bad tendency to procrastinate too, like I always put off schoolwork until the last minute, I'm even worse when it comes to optional Udemy course work. ",08Oct2017,3
8,"I remember one time, I was on summer break in high school and only brushed my teeth about once a week for like 2 months. Never flossed. I went to the dentist and thought I was gonna have like 10 cavities and bad gingivitis. But nope, the dentist gave me a B on brushing (that I never did) compared to the D's I used to get. Said my gums were healthier than ever, and had little plaque.

9,"I'm not sure if this is the best place for this post, but I think it will work. Two weeks ago, my Mom and my siblings (one biological and two step-siblings) all found out our Dad has been cheating on my Mom and is now leaving her for this other woman. Apparently, my step-Dad had an affair with this woman three years ago and stopped. In Dec or Jan of this year, this ladies husband kills himself. So her therapist supposedly told her to get in touch with people who made a difference to her... so she reaches out to my step-Dad. My step-Dad started casually mentioning her to my Mom. One day my Mom came home and my step-Dad was on the phone with his now GF. My Mom was at their house for an hour, he was still on the phone. She left for an hour and a half, came back, and he was still on the phone with her. At this point, my Mom is pretty suspicious. He'd been going out every night and not coming home until late. He paid $60+ for dinners almost every night when he says it's ""just him"". So all of this shit goes on for several months... until 2 weeks ago on Thursday. My Mom finally confronted my step-Dad who said yeah, there's another ""interest"" and he's going to be with her instead. So things have been pretty awful. At this point, I don't feel like I can have a relationship with him. He betrayed us all. And he really hurt my Mom. So I'm losing a Dad too. It sucks. I just wanted to know if anyone else has gone through this. What was it like for you? What did you do? Do you still have a relationship with your Dad/step-Dad? Thanks, guys.

13,"5 years ago, I met my now-husband (26M). I (25F) had an almost two year old son from a relationship I had in high school at the time. He is now 7. My husband has always been extremely supportive of my child — until the last few months. 

My husband and I have been considering divorce and going back and forth on it. Every time he is angry with me, he speaks ill of my son. We have an almost two year old daughter together and he tells me I should not expect him to treat both of the children equally because he only has one child and that my son is, instead, his “friend.” 

I’m not really sure who my husband is anymore. This isn’t the person I fell in love with. If he can’t accept my son, it’s a deal breaker. He tells me that he wants the three of us (me, him, and our daughter) but completely disregards my son. 

I love my husband - but I cannot and will not choose him over my son. I am a crossroad. He is a great dad to our daughter and my son’s father is still in the picture. 

I’m not looking for “daddy’s” for my kids - but I just want hope that there are men out there that will accept both of my children and not treat them this way. ",08Oct2017,9

I've stayed indoors most of my teenage years and next year I won't be a teenager anymore. I feel like I've missed out on my youth and that I've got quite a bit of catching up to do.

I've only kissed a handful of girls and only slept with 1 person my entire life (my gf). My first time was just a few months ago. Meanwhile my gf has slept with multiple people, had countless crazy party experiences and even had a threesome. I feel that I can't measure up, whether to her or others my age.

18,"My boyfriend of more than three years just broke up with me. Excuse my grammatical errors but I’m still shaking and can’t seem to think too clearly.

I’m not trying to give an excuse of why I was toxic but it was painful to hear he could not handle me anymore. He’s had indiscretions and I can’t deny that I became angry from time to time and was jealous at certain girls he became friends with. Still, I can’t breathe and I feel like ending it. Everything seems so pile up and I can’t handle. I need him more than anything. But he’s gone. I keep thinking about ending my life. I’m not trying to win him back.

21,"I have seen so much people that don't actually need a service animal label them as ""emotional support dogs"" so they can bring them anywhere. I feel like this is making a bad rep for those who actually *need* an emotional support dog. 

I suffer from really bad paranoia and I have a difficult time articulating my words when I get in a bad state (which is whenever I'm in a crowded area) but whenever I see someone who brings their dog everywhere I always run and pet it (as long as it's not a service animal, but most people in my area let me pet their emotional support dog when they'd bring it into the movie theatre I was working at. But even if it's an emotional support dog, I still ask) 

It always makes me feel better to pet a dog and my whole mood switches around and I can talk a lot better for a little bit. I don't feel as scared. But soon I walk away from the dog and I start to feel bad again.

24,"I just want to shout into the void for a bit and get this angsty shit off my chest.


I've only ever been on one date. It was senior year of high school and I asked this girl out. All it took for me to consider that she might like me is her being around me all the time, texting often, her friends telling me she liked me and sitting on my lap at a school football game.



I remember being nervous because I wasn't sure what to expect. I've always been awkward and had no self confidence at all. I figured I'd fuck it up somehow.



 But we went out to dinner and talked about family and stuff. Conversation was flowing well and then we went to the movie. I remember about 20 minutes in or so I thought to myself ""Hey, you big dumb idiot. This is a date. This is the part where you cuddle up during the movie."". Well shit. How the hell am I supposed to do that.  I figured it out and went ahead and just put my arm around her. She leaned into me and we stayed like that for a minute. 



But then she pulled away. I thought I fucked it up somehow. However, she gave a nervous giggle and put the armrest between us up and then leaned back into me. 



I never felt so wanted before.



Things fell through and I never got a second date. (She was very religious and I'm not). That was 2 years ago. Since then I've gone without any sort of physical contact. Not even a hug. I felt like one of those /r/foreveralone types. I'm not sure how to describe it. It sounds so stupid but every now and then I'd think about it.  



""This is how you're going to spend your life. Alone. You're your only company you can keep around.""



I didn't feel sorry for myself. It just felt like a fact. You have to work to eat, sometimes bad things happen, I'll never find someone who's interested in me and finds me worth caring about.

I was recently dumped by the girl I’ve spent the last four years of my life with. We were no longer getting along or treating each other the way we used too. We broke up on good terms and have zero hatred between the two of us. 

I bought a house for us and we share pets together. Our break up was very civil and we still talk on the daily. We even hung out a few evenings ago and discussed what we are going to do if we get back together. The love is still very much there on both ends. 

Last night, she went out with a friend and some others for  the friends birthday. My ex ended up using cocaine  for the first time and had sex with one of the guys she was hanging with. She doesn’t remember the sex and said she only did the coke because she was very inebriated.

I am not mad by any means, because we are broken up, but I am sad. We had discussed taking things slow and maybe getting going again eventually.
