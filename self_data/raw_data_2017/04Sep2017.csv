2,"Today while watering I noticed a half dozen medium sized piles of dog shit in my pathetically tiny yard that weren't there two days ago, and then later in the day I noticed that my new neighbors have two medium sized dogs. Hmm, I wonder if it's a coincidence?

Whoever is responsible, they're not being good people nor responsible dog owners, and they're breaking the law. I love dogs. I think dogs are great. But one thing I will not tolerate is someone leaving piles of dog shit on my lawn! Especially considering the months of landscaping work I put in to create it and the flower beds in the first place.

I have a pretty good idea it's happening early in the morning, so I plan on being up early tomorrow and see who's at fault. It's not the best way to make an introduction, but they need to be reminded of their obligations under their lease (we have the same landlord, although we're in adjacent properties) as well as their civic responsibility to be law abiding citizens.",04Sep2017,3
4,"My 16 years old brother was caught jumping into a school with his friend and they are accused of vandalism, he might face a long juvenile detention and my parents are going into a break down.
My mom just became cancer-free recently and she had enough stress in her life, my dad has hypertension and diabetes 2 and also a smoker who was shocked by what my brother did and trying to do everything to avoid him going into juvenile since its his last year in high school and it will screw up his whole life.

We never thought he would do such a thing, my parents gave him everything he needed and always loved him. My family has no history of crimes or such at all.

I'm just terrified that one my parents will get a stroke or a heart attack, I don't know what to do to keep them calm and avoid stress.
I have no-one to talk to since I'm trying to be relaxed as much as I could in front my family to not make them stressed.

I'm really really stressed about everything and I barely sleep or eat thinking about what will happen to him and what will happen to my parents, I really don't know what to do.. I'm also starting my first year of medical school soon 

I feel like I'm the one who didn't take care of him and watch what he is doing since I thought he is a teenager and I should give him space to not stress him and get him into doing bad things..
Both my parents are older than 55 and I'm just terrified that something will happen to them",04Sep2017,11

8,"That just happened a few hours ago and I'm still traumatized. I think I have some kind of mental illness. I really don't know who I can tell this to but Reddit.

I'm a teacher and today in front of my class of 30 college students, I casually said ""eat shit"" aloud for no reason. 

The worst part was that it had no context at all. It would have been great if I had said something like ""If you don't study hard you'll eat shit"". But no. I just threw that out in the middle of a random sentence during my lesson.

Luckily I kept calm and carried on like nothing happened. The students didn't react but I think they all heard it.

But what the hell?

I'm the kind of guy who talks to myself a lot in my head, even when I'm having a conversation with another person. And when I do that I swear a lot. I think a lot of people do it too. 

But this is the first time something has automatically jumped out of my head like that and became audible. The weird thing is I was not thinking about anything related to ""eat shit"". It was totally random. 

Why did this happen? I feel so ashamed right now.

And I'm afraid that this will happen again. It can definitely ruin my life.",04Sep2017,50
11,"I can't think of any other sub for this, so here goes.

I was tubing down the Salt River this weekend by myself, drinking on some Yuengling. See, you can't get Yuengling out here in Arizona. But I brought some with me from my visit home, so I have this precious commodity at my limited disposal. 

I went through some rough waters, and my cooler tipped over briefly, causing a can of beer to fall out. The current swept it away a lot faster than it did me. The beer was no where in sight.

About 10 minutes after the incident, I notice a shiny spot in the water about 100 feet away, and to my left. I paddle over to intercept it. Slowly, slowly, slowly...the metal object gets a bit closer, and I see it is a beer. It's my beer! The only can of Yuengling Lager floating alone in the river, not even dented. I managed to grab it with my feet and then my hands, tossing it back into the cooler triumphantly to chill.

Unfortunately, no one saw this go down. But it was pretty cool.",04Sep2017,2

22,"I know it might sound weird to hear, but honestly, I don't know...
I was born male. For me entire life I have identified as a male. But for this past half-year, I have felt a greater and greater longing for being a girl. 

It started with me kind of tasting the idea, small things like day dreaming of another life. Then I considered the thought, that if I had been born today I would rather have been born a girl. Nothing ""serious"" though. I kept on living my guy life, and these thoughts didn't really bother me. 

Then I slowly started to wish for change. I wanted to be a girl (and I still do), but I didn't know if I really felt like one. Like I didn't qualify. But today on the subway train home, I figured ""fuck it"". I think I might be transgender. Maybe I just wasn't strong enough to admit it until now. 

I read a bit about the transition process, and was gladly surprised. Since I live in Sweden, I have it relatively ""easy"" to go through with it, compared to the one in other countries. Also (at least I believe) Sweden is a progressive nation when it comes to societal acceptance of trans. 
I have not yet come out to anyone, only briefly to my closest friend. I know now that I (probably) feel like a girl, and I think I want to progress on this path.

If any of you have any advice on how to go forward, I would love to have it. Also it would help if you threw in some things to consider regarding the subject, things I should be aware of. 

I don't know if there is much left to say now... It felt good getting this out there.

Someone who's composed and calm yet unstable

25,"okay so , the aim of this post isn't to spark debate. i want to show as many people as i can that this sub The_Donald is pure cancer for the public to be digesting. 

so for starters, i was browsing reddit as usual last night , when i came across this : https://imgur.com/a/aH5B4

a pretty scary looking post nonetheless , so i go to the comments and read just the most horrifying replies. https://imgur.com/a/EP0hp

just a few examples, but i commented in disbelief : https://imgur.com/a/xOGFQ

i got a reply . so apparently the picture used in the tweet wasn't from a muslim protest , it was a islam ritual that is a tradition to mourn the death of Hussein ibn Ali, a very highly regarded figure in the religion. 

finding this truth out made me physically sick. And my internet wits immediately gave me an idea to comment a second time: https://imgur.com/a/XlFr6

the article: https://imgur.com/a/nAQKQ (mind the time stamp)

i got a reply with an article , and it was outdated by over a year. i scoffed at the unbelievable reality that these people might actually believe this is happening. 

shortly after , the ban hammer fell. i only assumed i was banned because of my super vulgar comment , but hey . wishing a bus to go through a crowd of people is much more alluring than a few fucking insults at your community .

I only wanted to vent my frustration. i don't ask if anything , except for someone to tell me if i'm in the wrong . like am i taking crazy pills or is this something pretty alarming? with the rising tension against muslim refugees is steadily rising , and stuff like this if it really is a fake story , is making the problem so much worse.",04Sep2017,382

28,"There are a lot of examples I could go over here, but I'm just gonna go with the one that just happened.

I've been having random blackouts. The biggest one was 45 minutes. The one that happened today was about 22 minutes. When I say blackouts, I mean periods of time that I do not remember whatsoever. The only reason I know the lengths of these blackouts is because I was on Discord, and it constantly displays the time on every message.

Anyways, after this one I had today, I knew it was time to tell my mom about it. I held it off because I knew what it would lead to. But at this point, I'm starting to realize that it could be dangerous. So I told her, and at first she brushes it off like it's normal, but when I finally get it through to her that it could be dangerous, she reluctantly agrees to take me to the doctor then rants about how 1. I'm a financial burden and 2. Doctors aren't to be trusted because they are arms of the government and they could take me away from her and do experiments on me. I eventually just wanted it to stop so I told her she doesn't have to take me.

29,"I found an old article about this while trying to clean my browser's bookmarks, and I remember how much it bothered, even disgusted me when I first read it. Apparently people have used this technique to improve relationships with existing friends and partners, which I guess eased my mind a little. But for the most part, it just bothers me, the same way it bothers me when fellow social-incompetents say they learned social skills via psychology (my usual internal reaction to that is ""So you manipulate people, is what you mean?""). 

There's just something that disgusts me about conducting something so meaningful with the deterministic, mechanical contrivance of a checklist. Of possibly forcing people to like you for no reason other than you said the right things at the right time, regardless of whether it reflects *you* or not. That, and I guess I'm terrified of being used or manipulated like that. It sounds really really bad to say I don't want my relationships tainted with science, my fantasy stripped away by facts, even if that's just what I'm saying. Kind of like how it's easy to take emotion in stride, see it as valuable and even beautiful until you, as a layman, try to consciously think of it as nothing but chemical reactions (my sole comfort there is that apparently real scientists don't have this problem, that looking at the complex neurochemical interactions that make up emotion or social behavior actually inspires people in the field, rather than rendering it repulsive, base, and absurd). It's obvious that there are certain, general patterns to human interactions and relationships, but any fascination or value or beauty there seems to die once those patterns are identified and used to prescribe modes of interaction. There's something *inauthentic* about it, about trying to consciously exploit those patterns rather than allowing a situation to follow it without intentional direction. It's part of why I can't bring myself to look into that subject matter for any personal use - it just seems wrong and unnatural. I think I'd almost rather be lonely than affect anything more than usual to ""be sociable"" or ""win friends"". The most I think I could stomach would be picking and choosing and morphing it into something as effective but more...me, I guess. That is, if I had the courage to even look into it, knowing how badly it will affect me. ",04Sep2017,3

35,"**TL;DR:** Basically my issue is I feel like I have opened my eyes to the infinite world of hypothetical possibilities in this life, so I've been this whole year ""stuck"" or ""paralized"" by such an overwhelming stream of thoughts and potential opportunities. Now I feel the only way out is starting doing stuff, just doing. But I cannot find the proper, ""perfect"" one thing to start with.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a 20 year old guy. I've idealized myself so much for as long I can remember, I always thought (and think) I am one of a kind, I have so many skills, I learn everything so fast, I am so creative and arty and passionate about life. And yeah, I still believe all of that is true, because I see it on myself, and people tell me that. But the thing is I feel I haven't done enough about this. I kept going to school, high school, college, just blinded by all the educational system, and only kept my hobbies and aspirations as that, hobbies and aspirations. I always thought ""someday in the future I will be a musician, I will travel the world, I will have many friends, I will be loved, I will have plenty of girls, I will look great, I will be famous, I will do the things that I dream of"".

&amp;nbsp;

But years were passing and I kept going to college, which I hated day to day, without even hoping anything to change in the present. Eventually last year I dropped out from college. Last summer I probably awakened. After last summer holidays, my entire ""me"" didn't feel like going back to college, I just purposedly forgot to sign up for the next year course, my mind was enlightened with all the actual possibilities out there in this world and life. I suddenly realized I had control over all aspects of my life. I realized could make a living from photography, music, video, travelling, art, all the things I've always enjoyed doing in my free time. I realized I had been so blind to myself, believing that I was awesome because I was in a top tier physics degree, because I would graduate at only 21. Suddenly nothing of that had any value anymore, I literally felt like reborn to the light of this life.

&amp;nbsp;

This happened more or less a year ago, and now that this summer is ending I'm trying to put my life in context again and find my next move. I feel this year I've been driven by passion and urgency more than anything, since I felt so ""mad"" to myself and the blinding system, and I felt I needed to get back the time I lost in college. So I started a new music band, played shows, composed songs, got my first job, learned a lot about photography and started my own portfolio, traveled to several countries (Rome, Vietnam, Thailand, UK, ...), got rid of useless relationships, met new incredible people, read so so many books and articles about philosophy and lifestyle, got into buddhism, meditate daily...

&amp;nbsp;

This takes me until today. Today I am again in my hometown, in my parents house. I have no money and no clear plans for this year to come. And I'm starting to feel lost and hopeless. Because I can't find my next move, I can't be sure about music and photography being my true passion, I can't be sure about my desires of living somewhere else. I'm not even sure if I should keep finding my way inside the occidental system or if I should go straight to a temple and become a monk. Seriously, I've gone too deep on all this mess.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like my problem right now is money. Because I want to leave my home to live somewhere else, and I don't want to come back in a few months because I couldn't make it. I feel I have soo many options out there to make money that I don't know which path to take. I say so many options due to my capabilities, because I know I have an entrepeneurial mind, I am creative and prefeccionist, and I can adapt and learn anything fast. Since I feel I have so many skills, I feel overwhelmed with all the possibilites out there. And since all of them take a considerable time to start showing results, I'm so afraid of taking the wrong one and realising it too late.

&amp;nbsp;

This year I've kinda willfully lost myself to stop moving blindly for a while and ponder my life and life situation. And now that I got to the time when I lately thought I could start the new life (more or less after this summer), I feel like I haven't travelled enough, tried enough things, found enough interests and passions, haven't lost myself enough. I feel I need to get rid of everything that defines me, I feel I should give away all of my stuff, go to the forest and get naked, and start from zero in this world again. Make my new first friends, get my first new clothes, get my own first bed... I think it is a desire of taking all the material things off of my life, to eventually find what remains, which is my true ""me"" I guess.

&amp;nbsp;

At the beginning I wanted to get rid even from my own person, my ""self"", because I didn't like myself anymore, but through this year I've realized I actually like who I am, I don't want to get rid of me to be someone new, I want to only keep and improve the good things of me and get rid of the bad things of me. So this idea about going naked to the forest to start from bare scratch is not fully intelligent because why would I give away my guitar, my recording interface, my skateboard, my camera, my savings...? If I did, I feel I would be going backwards on my path... is that right? I'm honestly asking...

&amp;nbsp;

I've always dreamed of moving to London and starting there my ""artistic or whatever"" carreer. My actual life path. And now that I actually have the opportunity, the time, the proper contacts there (a professional photographer and a friend/mentor), now that is the time to buy the flight and go, I'm starting to find the reasons why I still mustn't go, blah blah... These reasons are that I still am not ready to settle down in one particular place, that I still didn't explore enough options, because probably my true passion is somewhere else beyond music and photography... if ""my true passion"" even means anything... do we really humans have ""one true passion""... I'm starting to doubt this as well...

&amp;nbsp;

As you can see, I'm mostly stuck in my own head due to this overwhelming infinity of possibilities and thoughts, and thoughts I know I still don't have but will, and all the possible life paths that are and will be, and.....

&amp;nbsp;

I've been reading books like The Power Of NOW and others about meditation and buddhism, and I truly love and see the value in all that, and love practising it, but now that I read my own words I see that is not fully working on me (althought I DO see a lot of improvement in myself thanks to it), I still feel so afraid and hopeless and lost without any guiding light... I doubt about everything, I doubt about the things that I always enjoyed the most. That's why I now feel I lost all my guiding lights... but I doubt in an irrational way, in a really deep and ""without-words"" way, a really intuitive and profound way, if that makes any sense. In a really dark and unclear way, that's it. In a not healthy way, in a not constructive and problem-solving way.

&amp;nbsp;

And now I'm going to ask for help, even though I know all the help I can find is inside me, and that no matter what I get from the outside world, eventually I myself will have to solve me... I say it but I don't know if I understand it, I don't even know if I believe it.. maybe that's why I can't apply it...",04Sep2017,1

My ex is dating this super beautiful, amazing girl I know.. Good for them. I hope he may never treat her the way he did me. It just makes me feel like there was something about me that caused him to do what he did. Like there is something unlovable about me. I've been single 4 months now and I feel like.. I'm older now, not as charming as I used to be, not as pretty.. Unwanted. 

I was warned I'd be lonely. I was warned this would be hard.. but it's the middle of the day on labor day and I don't have a single thing to do before work. A single person to talk too. A single spare dollar to do something other than pay bills or buy things I really need with.
