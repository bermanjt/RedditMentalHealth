He always told me ""The Band"" was the best in his opinion.  He got to bring his young daughter to meet The Dali Llama.  

I got to live there for a year.  Best year ever.  I had great friends who knew them personally.

If you can, watch ""The Last Waltz"" by Scorsese.  And watch ""Jonathan Demme"" Stop Making Sense.  Both are fabulous.

Thanks Mike, best big brother ever.  I LOVE you.

4,"I've been in bed for a while with depression. About 4 years. I dropped out of college and just checked out of life. gained about 50 pounds and threw away my life. 


Today I went to a temp agency to find work. I still feel absolutely awful but I need a job. I aimed as low as I possibly could. This place is notorious for just throwing bodies at jobs until one or two stick. they have a massive turn over rate and work the most soul sucking, low paying jobs around here. 

And guess what? they didn't want me. They basically told me to fuck off in much kinder words. I know it's my almost baron work history. I haven't worked since i got hit wiht depression and only worked a few jobs before that. 

I aimed as low as I possibly could and still got turned down. So I don't know what to do. ",20Jul2017,4
5,"So this past fall I uprooted my life and moved to a new city for work (will come back to this in a second). I didn't know anyone when I moved here and still have only met a very small number of people. 

Meeting people is tough for me since I'm very introverted. And toss on the fact that I don't like the bar/club setting. Not having friends has really brought a new addition of loneliness to the depression that I'm dealing with. 

The people I have met Ive built relationships with. I've started seeing someone and it's really great and I'm actually happy when I'm with them. 

My job isn't what I thought it was going to be now that I've been doing it for a year. It's way more traveling, paperwork/take home work, and again lonely as hell. I want to quit but I am unable to because of an employment contract.  

So to sum it up: I'm lonely, depressed, along with the fact that I hate my job. The one upside to the situation is I've made a few friends and am building an intimate relationship.

6,"So a friend's son's bday is coming up tomorrow and he just got a new PC.  I figure, what's a better way to start off his PC gaming experience than Fallout 3, one of my favorite games of all time (only behind NV)?

I'll just go to GoG and buy him a key, right?  Nope, because I can't pay with either Paypal, or with a credit/debit card until my account is 3 months old, and the only other payment options are super sketchy.

That's alright though, surely Steam will come through!  What's that, he needs to be on my Steam friends list?  That's just great since I don't have a Steam account either and he doesn't have Steam.

Perhaps Bestbuy or Gamestop have it in stock near me?  If by near me I mean 50 miles away, sure.

Maybe Walmart?  They're selling it for 2-3 times the price of everyone else, so I didn't even bother seeing if local stores have it in stock.  

Seriously people, how do you just buy a god damn game key for a friend?

I am a pretty healthy person. A little on the skinny side, but my weight is medically normal (BMI 21) and I am sporty. I am a good runner and have a lean body type. I have abs (sure, they dont count on skinny guys) and am generally fit. I guess i have the body type of a soccer player. 

The only thing is I dont lift. I dont take protein or shakes. Why? I dont want to and it doesnt interest me. I just dont care I guess.

Am i crazy or is there nothing wrong with this?

My line of work is dominated by gym bros. They constantly talk about lifting and clearly view self worth by bicep and chest size. One of them in particularly **every fucking day** comments about my body size  and sarcastically comments about how huge I am. It irritates the shit out of me but if I admit that and show weakness I will never hear the end of it. So i have to just ignore it. 

Three others i work with comment as well but 90% of it comes from the one guy.

Why do these people exist? Why are they so fucking obsessed with the body size of other straight dudes? It drives me up the fucking wall.

I have nothing against lifters and I am glad they enjoy a healthy hobby. Why cant so many of them show the same attitude to those of us who dont lift. I cant get through a day of work without having people comment on my leanness.

Do i have to gain weight and be obsessed with bicep size just to live in peace. Jesus.",20Jul2017,1
10,"so basically i have this pipe dream of becoming an indie pop star. it's dumb, i know.

i'm about to graduate from an Ivy League university with a great GPA in a highly employable major. for some reason, i made the decision that i might want to pursue a PhD, and now i'm putting myself through a hellish workload trying to catch up in my major and get research experience. when i graduate, i'll go on to work as an RA for a year or two and then start a PhD program. that's the plan, anyway. the only plan that makes sense to me right now. and yet i know that, if i go down this path, this will become my life.

i love music. i LOVE music. i've been producing music on-and-off for five years now. by on-and-off, i mean that university has been such a hellish timesink that it killed any claim i had of calling myself a producer.

about a year ago, i started listening to Grimes. i'm kind of obsessed with the idea of Grimes -- that an independent producer/songwriter could make an album that changed pop music. that *i* could have that kind of impact.

let's be real, though. i probably won't have that kind of impact. so many people try, and almost all of them fail. but if i continue to pursue this PhD, i won't even have made the attempt.

over the summer, when i'm not working, i've been putting as much time as i can into writing songs, but it feels so futile because once the semester starts, i won't have time to work on music until January.

a few months ago, i had an idea. stop worrying about this PhD shit, find a high-paying 9-5, pay off my student loans, make music in the evenings/weekends, and save as much money as possible. as soon as i have enough money to live off of for two years, i quit my job, move out into the middle of nowhere into a house with no Internet access, and make music all day every day. i know it's ridiculous and idealistic and everything, but i can't stop thinking about it and i had to type it out.

and it's not like i wouldn't enjoy pursuing a PhD. i'm just really uncomfortable with the fact that the decision to pursue a PhD would mean giving up on a dream, no matter how unrealistic that dream is.",20Jul2017,5

20,"I am now volunteering at an NGO. There is a bunch of us student volunteers plus two interns. One of the interns is an acquaintance of mine. We have only briefly met once during an event organised by our mutual advisor. I get the sense that she is a bit intimidated by what I know and I seemed a bit too ambitious to her so I tried to tone it down a bit.


I was chatting with the two of them about future job opportunities. I asked her if a lot of people from her grade is interested in a certain type of job (which is associated as being lucrative and the employers have a reputation of being picky in terms of grades) and she answered that the smart people will aim for it as usual.

I asked her if it is true that they don't always choose the smartest people. She said yes. I asked her if it is really that common that people with such awkward social skills exist (as mentioned to us by our professors) and if these companies prefer candidates with average social skills + really good grades vs someone with average grades + really good social skills. We then ended up talking about people with good grades + poor social skills vs poor grades plus good social skills. She then mentioned something about how our advisor individually said to her that it is who you know that gets you jobs rather than what you know. I then jokingly mentioned a mutual acquaintance of ours who has a wide network in the industry (as in his name). She then said ""He has bad grades?"" and I said ""No as in having a wide network is good as our advisor suugested"". She then asked ""She mentioned him to you individually?"" and I said ""Nah just be like them and find more internships"".


I am scared of offending her now. It all happened so quickly but I can tell she felt bad about not having the top grades and a wide network in the industry. Should I apologise?

I havent had a connection with myself seince october....i really dont feel like myself anymore. Life to me is pointless at this point. I wasnt enough for her. The one thing that i cared about more then anything else in my life, didnt want me anymore. I wasnt enough.....im never enough....

Im planing to kill my self. It will be a good time seince my family is on vacation and wont be home till saturday. I think im just going to hang myself from the sealing.

35,"Good morning/afternoon/evening.

I don't really know where to post this, I've been more of a ghost on Reddit than anything else, and I feel like this post is too unimportant to go into a more advice-focused subreddit, so here it goes.

A bit of background (true story starts at “here's where shit's up there…”, skip if you wish). I turned 18 a few months ago, study in an engineering school, and am currently doing an internship (it's a manual work experience, which is a part of the school curriculum). I'll add some things about my personality and physical appearance as it may influence some things. I appear androgynous (I'm actually a trans dude who should start hormones in a few months…), have a rocker/metalhead/punkish/goth/emo/visual-kei while still casual clothing style. I'm reserved, introverted, very calm, poker-faced, serious and polite, but I'm also that terrible provocative dirty-minded bastard who gets his rock off when he makes you react. Regarding my appearance, I suppose I'm quite attractive to some people simply because of I don't have too much of an ugly face and my clothing style appeals to them, otherwise I don't think people find me too nice-looking (or at least, my look) as I know I don't look very approachable or friendly.

Relationship-wise, I've been fucked-up from the get-go and I doubt it'll ever get all conventional. Just to say a very few things, I generally loath romance and need a kind of power dynamic (as in, “I provoke you, you provoke me back, etc, until shit hits the fan”), but cannot stand controlling someone's life or vice-versa. I'm gay, and a switch (as in, mostly a 'submissive' without a submissive attitude, given I'll never shut my mouth and will continue shit-talking you, provoking you, and wouldn't mind from time to time if you didn't manage to tame me, thus making me in control). I'm very sensual/sensuous, literally: while I generally hate human contact, I sometimes (depending on the person?) *love* being touched, caressed in a purely sensual – or erotic – manner and vice-versa, without it necessarily leading to sexual thoughts (it can though). I can't see myself doing one-night stands with strangers, or having sex friends. It didn't prevent me from screwing a guy only once, though I had hopes of more (in the end, the fact that I'm a dude and act like it despite my current body made him recoil after seeing me once). Three partners in total: said guy and another one with whom it was non-sexual a few months ago, and my *cousin* a few *years* ago (shit happens). I don't “date”. Either it's a mutual 'serious' relationship, or maybe I could actually do a purely physical thing (I don't have much experience, heh). Regarding my attraction, I'm very rarely attracted to someone, and they don't have to have a pretty face for me to be attracted to them. I know for a fact that certain physical traits immediately have me fawning, without caring about that person's personality, but I'm starting to think that maybe there's also a personality trait I'm attracted to…

I've started my internship last week, and still have two weeks left (not counting the current one). Everything's all good, I have to say I got it thanks to my father who's a close friend to the manager, and my parents know a few people working there (but I haven't told them, so I'm just a regular intern for them). I should add that most people see me as a girl there, the manager put me in the women's locker room when I arrived, and while I don't suddenly go into the women's toilets, speak in a feminine manner, or changed my first name to a female one, I didn't correct them (as it's work and I don't want to be a bother…). Also, I'm not wearing my usual clothing style you either love or hate: no accessories, old jeans and t-shirts that I don't care about (there's just my long and gray hair which is very much the same as always…).

Here's where shit's up there all over the fan and walls: I'm eff-ing crushing on a employee (who seems like he has a bit of responsibility in his job – it's a supermarket by the way), who's more than thirty years old, who's not that good-looking, who I haven't spoken much at all (I don't know, maybe three minutes in total?). Thinking about it, that's probably his kind-of provocative demeanor, or smirk I've sometimes (okay… maybe twice, haha) seen him address me. Once (only once!), there was a small box with some very random things in there, I remember there was dog's food (IIRC) for instance and other things you'll find in a supermarket, and he just casually told me “what's that, 's that yours?”. This morning, he asked me about some packs on the floor, if they should be put back in the storehouse, and answered me “all right, no problem, it was just to check :)” when I replied. *Anyway*, forgive the boredom, enough about my cheesy memories.

I know I shouldn't do anything, as he's probably not interested at all, maybe he's even married and has kids (I'll have to admit I don't get that impression at all from him), his age's the double of mine, I don't want anything serious (I mean, I don't see myself living my life with a guy who's like 14-16 years older than me. And as I said, I don't date or do one-time things, so being with someone should mean to me that I *could* imagine them ending up being my lifetime partner. It should…). He's never addressed me as either a girl or a boy, so I don't even know how he sees me, and he knows nothing about me, there's not my usual pretty flamboyant appearance clothing-wise to give people a quick look of my overall persona (and which can apparently be a seduction tool, haha). The first time I saw him when my manager told him to give me some work, he was very nice, ask me about my presence here, told me a bit about him (well, just that he passed a degree in 2001 (that's how I guessed his age)). At the beginning of this week, he asked me if I was fine working here, if that wasn't too boring or anything. He *is* nice.

Maybe I'll just forget about him when my internship ends. That's very likely, I reckon. I mean, that's how crushes usually end, and while it has happen very rarely to me, I'm no different from anyone on that regard. So why bother making a move, when there's so few chances anything could happen, and I don't even know what I'd want out of it. Just a one-time fuck? Yeah, fine (for other reasons, too. Having my first 'real' full intercourse with someone in an unconventional manner is what I want). A… physically intimate, sensual and sexual, relationship? Maybe. I only know that I want some physical contact.

I'm at a loss, for a change. Reason tells me to just wait until the internship ends, and this feeling will end with it too. Now, passion tells me to *do something*. If, by any miserable chance, he is at least a little bit interested, I doubt he'd do anything considering his much older than me, we're at work, I'm a young uni student who's got all his life in front of him, who doesn't look too bad and thus shouldn't be desperate. Consequently, if anything happens one day, I guess it'd be *my* doing. But what, how, when? After I'm done with the internship? I wouldn't want to jeopardize anything for me or him job-wise while I'm still working in the same place (though we're both over the age of majority). And what do I even tell him? “I want you/your touch” is what would work best, as cringy as it sounds, but it's not like I can actually explain what I exactly want as I don't even know, and as I could enjoy completely different things.

I hope it's understandable, it's difficult explaining stuff which is totally unclear in my own head. Feel free to tell me if something's not well-explained. *sweats* I don't have anyone to talk to about this apart from my best friend. I'll be very thankful for any advice, thought, reaction, whether it be a one-liner “let go” or a full paragraph of how I could make things advance in any direction. Also, if you know any subreddit in which I could eventually crosspost this, it could be nice as I don't wish to post that stupid idiocy in a subreddit where it would bother people.

Oh, I'm French by the way. Apologies for any mistakes English-wise.

**TL;DR:** I'm 18, crushing on a +30-year-old guy, he's an employee in the supermarket who took me on for a 4-week internship. We don't talk much. Do I make a move, during or after my internship, or do I just let go?

**Edit:** I forgot to say that guessing his actual age really surprised as I thought he'd be younger, and I'm not at all into older people (it's fine up to ~25 years old). That's a first.",20Jul2017,3
36,"My Husky is usually such a fucking angel. Then today he just lost his shit when I took him to the backyard to do his business. Ran into the woods and came out with a groundhog, fucking furiously swinging him around between his teeth. I was almost positive he was swinging so hard the ~8 pound groundhog was going to fly out of his mouth and into my face. I'm yelling at him like a maniac to let him go but he's just tunnel visioned. 

He runs down to the garage and finally let's go of the poor guy. We're now literally in my garage, 1 foot from my recently washed car. At this point I'm sure he must be dead, but he's still alive and standing. Groundhog makes some kind of growl/cry noise and stands his ground, and my dog is doing the same. Sure he's just a little critter but I could feel the will to live and it was just sad. I try with all my power to verbally stop him with phrases he 100% understands and he ignores them and goes back at him.

Again he swings this poor guy around my garage and spills blood everywhere (including a little on my car) till he dies. Watching the flickering of life was disturbing. Cue moving groundhog corpse out with my shovel, thoroughly cleaning blood off my dog, car, and garage floor, and calling the vet to make sure he has rabies shots and everything, and here we are now. That sucked to watch, idk why, I'm not particularly squirmish but that was just savage in the traditional sense of the word. I also am particularly sensitive to seeing animals get hurt so that's another thing, I'd never go hunting or anything. I know dogs are hunters and this is instinctual to them so I can't really be overly upset for him doing what he naturally does, but shit dude.

42,"Hello,
I have a dilemma. I have been married to a wonderful, kind, committed man for 10 years. He is everything one could ask for in a husband. The problem is that I don't know if I've ever been truly attracted to him. This feeling began when we were just dating and has nagged at me on and off during our marriage. I was attracted to my husband because of his sense of humor, his kindness, his love towards his family. I guess you could say we had and have emotional and intellectual chemistry. However, I have never been attracted to his body. In fact, I have always preferred to see him with his shirt on rather than off. This is not because he is fat or flabby... I've just never felt attracted to his body. 
This has been a point of shame for me for many years, even before we married. The truth is I never felt like I could let him go because he was such a wonderful person. I couldn't think of a better person to get married to, in spite of not feeling a real physical attraction for him. Now, unfortunately, I am beginning to feel attracted to other men...men who I feel physical chemistry for, not just emotional chemistry. I'm beginning to wonder if I made the wrong decision by marrying someone I consider my best friend in the world. Many people will say that the body changes with age so it doesn't matter if you're physically attracted or not. But my problem is that the things that made me feel unattracted years ago are only becoming more magnified. I'm not sure what I should do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated !",20Jul2017,1

So i kindof feel bad that she's putting herself in this position. I know there are things she can be great at, i just dont know what jobs to suggest. So as the title states, what are some good non desk jobs for women? Or both genders. Thank you for your suggestions. ",20Jul2017,1
46,"I was really close with her. And for various reasons I didn't talk to her for a while. But now I know that she is single. So I said let's hang out, but she said she had plans with this Adam dude (I actually know him, he's something between an acquaintance and a friend to me) 

I said sure, some other time then. Later she told me she is still going through a hard time because of the break up, and it was hard for her to talk to me, and I said that I would give her space. 

If she later on tells me 'Adam is my boyfriend', I'll fucking break down. I can't anymore.",20Jul2017,1
47,"So this literally just happened and I'm freaking out until family gets here to help. Not fixing errors I'm on mobile I'm so sorry in advance. For backstory my SO dad has terminal brain cancer and is on a LOT of medication and it makes him really spacey unsteady on his feet but for the most part as long as someone's there to keep an eye on him he's independent and gets around on his own. So I'm putting my two year old down for her nap and she goes to sleep. I'm browsing reddit and I hear someone knocking on the door to the sunroom so I go to see who it is. I'm halfway to the door and I can see ""dad"" on the floor so I run out there and open the door. I'm F, 120 pounds and 5""4. He's like six foot and easily 200 pounds. On top of that I have an auto immune disease that has muscle wasting as a symptom. He's coherent and told me the dog tripped him. He doesn't look in pain. There's a small cut on his arm but nothing serious. He's had two knee replacements though and he can't get back off of the ground by himself. I put my arms under his and try and lift him to his feet so he can sit in his wheelchair. I absolutely can not lift him. I'm seriously panicking at this point. He's facing his wheelchair so I can't just lift him into it. Id have to get him up and turned around. I text my SO and tell him to get here or someone here ASAP. He's not working far away. Then I call his wife and tell her to come home and am just seeing who will make it here first. I go back inside and can't handle seeing him on the ground so I pull another chair (even though it was higher than the wheelchair and I knew I wouldn't be able to lift him) and move it as close behind him as I can. I put my arms under his armpits and this time I wrap my arms around his chest and lace my hands together. I squat down low and I have no FUCKING clue how but I was able to get him up high enough that he was able to get himself in the chair. He rested and got back on his feet and is eating a Popsicle in his chair watching TV. His wife and son are here. I'm still freaking out. THANK GOD FOR ADRENALINE!!!

TL:DR lifted 200 pound FIL off of the ground despite being 120 soaking wet. Panicked Mom strength FTW. 
Update: When FIL fell he said he tripped on the dog but turns out he's been heavily over medicating himself. Going to see if he'll concede to his wife being in charge of his pills and hopefully this never has to happen again",20Jul2017,14

49,"So, after 9 months of no contact, she texts back. Last time I heard from her, she told me to ""stay the fuck away from her"", amd I did just that.

Apparently, according to a mutual friend, she wants to try to be friends again, and saw something in France that might interest me.

Still.

I don't know why I feel this way. Feels like someone injected me with a 9 gallon bucket of adrenaline. I used to miss her, long for her, but that ended months ago. I thought I felt nothing towards her anymore.

Then why do I feel like this? Help. Actually, its reddit. Help, like, comment, suscribe, pet a dog, slap my face with a 12ft dildo etc.

50,"I have a short lunch break, and had to run home to pick up a package that had been delivered (didn't want it sitting in the sun all day or stolen), and had a couple extra minutes on my way back to work. So I pulled in to my local convenience store near work to snag a candy bar and bag of chips.

So I'm stepping into my spot in the line and this old woman says ""excuse me"". I turn to face her and she looks right at me and then stands sort of near the woman in front of me in line. So, naturally, I figure they're together. The old woman hasn't brought anything up to purchase and she and the other woman are both black. I know that's totally racist of me to assume that, but it's one of those things that contributed to me thinking they might be together in this instance.

So the other woman rings up and gets her change and I expect them both to walk out, but they don't. The older woman hangs back and steps forward right in front of me, and asks the cashier for a pack of cigarettes. Okay, no big deal, I'm gonna let this slide since it's not worth it to make a scene and the moment to call her out is passed. Whatever.

But then she proceeds to take literally five minutes to search for cash in her wallet, and then her entire purse, before finally pulling out a bill and handing it to the cashier. And she did it all in that way that old people do that takes forever to do anything at all.

I started getting impatient and sighing, or something that she must have noticed because she looked at me like I was an asshole for reacting to her old crusty ass taking all day. Then she said ""sorry"" really sarcastically to me.

It took everything I had not to say she wouldn't have to apologize to me if she hadn't cut me off in line like that, but she was super old, like, at least in her 80's, and here I am, in my early 30's, a big intimidating white dude yelling at this shriveled old black lady? Nah, that doesn't look good. But man, I wanted to. I was fucking steaming.

Just venting. Thanks for listening.",20Jul2017,82

56,"Hi, I'm 15 years old and I met a guy from Internet when I was 14, he was a nice guy seriously, but he started to control me basically psychologically, he began to say that he would kill himself if I abandoned him, that he have several ways of killing himself, among many other things but this has already been months. The truth is that last year or so he is still alive. I spoke with close people about the case, they said to block it on all social networks and I already done but I only block the messages on facebook. Today he still leaving his like on my photos as if he wanted to talk with me. What should I do? Talk to him or ignore him? ",20Jul2017,3
57,"This story takes us back to February, 2009, in the northeast United States. It seemed the stars were about to align, and I, the awkward band geek had recently started dating a really hot cheerleader. She was a year behind me in school, I was 16 and she was 15. 

So we are at a local Moose Bowling Alley, for those of you who don't know what a Moose is, it is an old club like Rotary Club or Lyons Club, fairly common in North Eastern US small towns. They have a little smoky dive bar, a banquet room, and of course a dilapidated 6 lane bowling alley. 

A friend of ours was having her 16th birthday party in the banquet hall one night. My then girlfriend, let's call her Shayna, was a bit of a crazy girl, and I had just begun to crack the shell on that. The entire party she kept insisting that the birthday girl only invited me because she had a crush on me. This accusing other people of being into me was becoming a common thing. Years down the road it would become so bad it was abusive behavior, but as a guy with low self confidence, I saw it as an endearing ego booster. 

So we are at this Moose bowling alley, and my girlfriend is getting all upset because she thinks everyone wants on my dick. I'm still all pumped this hot chick thinks I'm like ""the sexiest guy in school"" as she would say, so I'm just all on board. 

Well, she gets so upset she says  she needs some air. So we step outside into the parking lot and begin to walk to my slick new ride. Sidenote about that, White 1994 Buick regal with the white walls. Red cloth interior, with a bench seat in the front. That baby burned oil faster than it burned gasoline, and that night, it seemd that broken in front bench was about to be the home of some real magic.

I'll skip a lot of details here and get to the point where we are both completely naked and she is straddling me. My left side is completely numb at this point, the seatbelt buckle found an uncomfortable spot, but I was not about to do anything that might get my penis further away from his mission.

Shayna looks at me, and I distinctly remember her doing her cute signature lip bite, and she says ""I'm ready.""

I couldn't believe it, it was about to happen. I don't have a condom. She doesn't care. I am seconds away from penetration when suddenly she says ""stop!"" and I naturally oblige. 

She then absolutely breaks down in tears and collapses into a emotional wreck in my arms. I took this opportunity to get that damn seat belt out of my ass. 

I ask Shayna what is wrong, and she says to me, ""Everyone just tells me I should do it. I have so many friends doing it, people our age do it all the time. Do you think we should?""

What I did next, my penis will never forgive me for, but my heart grows more thankful for each passing day. I told her it was okay, and that if she wasn't ready then I didn't even want to have sex. We put our clothes back on, and headed back into the party. For some reason Shayna wasn't so quick to point out the other girls that night as we danced and laughed and enjoyed ourselves, and for an evening I lived, a teenage movie fantasy.
