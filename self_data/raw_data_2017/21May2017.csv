1,"So there's this girl I work with who I've been pretty good friends with ever since I started just under a year ago. We always have a pretty good laugh together, always just seemed to be on the same wavelength about loads of things, and I always looked forward to working with her. It was purely friendship though, and while I did think she was a pretty attractive girl, I didn't think of her beyond that. But, like Rick says in Rick and Morty, a man capable of sustaining a platonic relationship with an attractive female co-worker is entirely hypothetical.

I don't know what happened but something just clicked in my head and I ended up slowly developing feelings for her. I found myself looking forward to working when she's on, which is fucking insane cause I kinda hate my job. She was off work for like a month or two there cause she had exams and I found myself missing her when I was working. We still talked a little over Facebook and stuff, but I honestly just wanted to see her.

Anyway, today she was back, and there was like some weird thing going on between us. I can't really describe it. We were hanging around each other the full shift, laughing at almost every single little thing the other would say. It felt like someone was kind of interrupting if they talked to us. Time just went so fast, I was having so much fun just talking to her. I'm trying to put into words what it was I felt between us but honestly I can't. It just felt like we were both energised by being with each other. Like we were both in on some massive inside joke that nobody else at our job know about. Kind of a shitty analogy but the only one I can think of. It honestly felt like the kind of joking around Jim and Pam seem to have together in The Office.

Anyway, it didn't go unnoticed. One of my managers was jokingly arguing with me about something and she jumped in to take my side of it, and he laughed and said she's taking my side cause she has a thing for me. There was like the slightest bit of awkwardness when he said it, but she quickly just played along and whenever she done a favour for me the full shift she would teasingly say 'I'm only doing this for you cause I'm so into you'. Other people were joining in on the joke and shit too. At one point I had to go to the other side of the store and she made an excuse to come round and sit and talk to me for a few minutes. 

Like I really can't say what was going on between us, we've always had fun around each other but tonight was something completely different. I managed to get sent home early cause the store was quiet, and honestly I didn't even really want to go home. I wanted to just stay and talk to her. I'm not working until next weekend and all I can think about is going to work with her. I feel like there's something definitely going on between us, but I don't know if it's that or it's just because we hadn't seen each other for ages and we were kinda catching up. I can't tell.",21May2017,2
2,"I'm kind of just typing out my thoughts as they come so I apologize if it's a bit unorganized. About 4 months ago my ex and I broke up after about 3.5 years. It wasn't even a bad break-up or anything; in fact, we've spoken since then and we're on completely friendly terms. The problem was that we'd become long distance about 6 months before the break-up and she just felt that she couldn't handle it anymore on top of focusing on residency (we're nearing the end of our first year now).

So now, here I am moving on, or at least trying to. I've gone on one date that didn't really go anywhere, and met up with another girl for coffee who I think is pretty cute. However, she's been pretty busy so there hasn't been a second date and she's not the best texter. I'd like to meet someone new/have things go further with this girl, but part of me knows that's probably just me being lonely, but it's hard to help it. I don't think I'm ready to see my ex with a new guy, yet I don't want to be alone. She posted a picture on her snapchat story today with a guy who I'm pretty sure is just a friend, but I still caught myself thinking ""who is that??"" I wonder how she would feel seeing me with a new girl.

So that's that. Just wanted to kind of get my thoughts out. Feel free to offer advice, ask questions, or just chat and help me not feel too lonely on a Saturday night.",21May2017,2
4,"I love both subjects and am an avid gamer and I also enjoy learning about the body and treatments etc. 

For those with a hand in game development:

Before you started school for it or your career, did you have any aspirations? 

What made you choose this field? Are you happy with this decision?

Were you a big gamer before you started and do you still love it just as much?

For those in medical:

Was it your love of learning about the medical career you chose or was it the money? 

Is it just something that came easy for you to learn?


For both careers, do you have any regrets or pros/cons?

I really appreciate everyone's time who respond or read this post. I've always been torn between the two industries and started and stopped the enrollment for both in the past.",21May2017,2
8,"I say partially because I was two beers into my liquid courage when I decided to do it.

My stepdad and I were at a restaurant after seeing Aliens: Covenant (meh movie) and when we first walked in I knew I was in trouble because the girls were in tied shirts and shorts shorts. I'm a 23 year old virgin with some anxietyâ€‹, so while I wasn't super excited, I couldn't help but look at whatever I could. They were selling sex and I was buying. They were plenty of girls to look at as we were eating at our table, but when I saw this girl (called R from now on)  at the bar I just knew I had to say something before I left. I told my stepdad that after we paid the check that I would pay for our beers if he just sat with me at the bar for ten minutes while I worked up the courage to say something to R. He agreed and while he went to the bathroom I sat at a seat at the bar close to R. After she fixed me my beer I started a conversation by asking about her tattoo on arm. It was her deceased grandfather's birthday and I told her I wanted one for mine, but hadn't decided after 5 years. She made a comment and walked off to serve others. When she can back near me I asked her about her job and her favorite part of it, to which she said the people, leading me jokingly asking what's the weirdest thing that she's had that didn't involve her uniform. Basically, a couple asked her to let the wife watch. Some more random convo and advice from my stepdad later and I left shaking her hand and saying that I hoped to see her later and we left. 

I can't help but feel proud of myself for putting myself out there and trying to just talking to a random girl instead of just making semi awkward eye contact for three seconds and thinking of what could be. I've held conversations with girls before but those were either ""girlfriends"" of friends and awkward convos with their frinde or co-workers, so I try to not out much thought into them, but this was completely different.

I plan on trying to visit the place semi-regularly to try to see where it goes, too.",21May2017,1

15,"If you still have grandparents, call them.

I just got word today that my grandma died after complications coming from a hip replacement.  Nobody saw it coming.  She was doing alright.  In general, her health was great.

She had the replacement a couple days ago, and I was going to call her today.  It had been too long anyway.  The reason I didn't call her yesterday? I went to the beach.

Now I'm sitting here on the opposite side of the planet from everyone I truly care about (I'm teaching in Korea) wishing that I had just taken a minute to call her before my oh-so-important beach trip.

That person/people you've been putting off calling? Do it now.  Not for me, but for yourself.  You might regret not doing it today.",21May2017,79

27,"Hello, I keep getting [this](http://i.imgur.com/AT0538P.png) error message.   
 ""response code error: 204,  
request headers: {}  
response headers: {connection=[keep-alive], date=[sun,21 May 2017 14:59:05 GMT], server={[kisa]}""

I just managed to screenshot it in time before it dissapeared, it only stays up for a few seconds. The date obviously changes to the current date and time. Sometimes I also get the message that ""it only allows downloading these types of files on wifi connection"" (paraphrasing, but something similar) 

Have a Google Nexus 5X on the latest update if that helps. 

It started after my friend sent me a picture on snapchat &amp; apparently you can now have messages forever up on your screen instead of the 10s limit. Anyways I kept it up without clicking on anything, started to get the same message (different date) but didn't click on the picture as it would go away. And now this has been showing up a few times every hour. Don't know if it is due to snapchat but since it started after this it would seem as if it was caused by this.   
If anyone knows what to do it is much appreciated. ",21May2017,1
30,"I have nothing else going on in my life right now but video games that have long bored me to death. There's nothing I want to do. No other jobs I want (I hated the one I had too). I just feel obligated to get another job and keep going because that's what I'm supposed to do. 

I wish I had dreams. When I've wanted things in the past, I was the type to never give up until I got it. Nowadays there's nothing I want, not vacations, not sex, nothing. 

I have social anxiety, and I am too awkward to get hired by anyone. I got lucky with the job I just lost and kept getting promoted from the bottom up because there was nobody else to choose from. I am 25. I am getting super old and I think this may just be my time to die. My left lung has been in pain for the last few days, and I've been having dizzy spells from coughing. I really hope it's cancer that will take me soon.  ",21May2017,0

52,"Something unexplainable, an unknown language, It's just a connection beyond our human interaction, I don't lust after you yet i do biologically, Can you feel our souls connect like i do? I know you can't, It's weird but why is it one sided? Perhaps my world revolves around you, Isn't that far off the manly traits society might give one's judgement to be little. I'm going beyond society so what if you are my world? Why should i let it bother me what others might think? I'm afraid you might think it as them as i am conditioned just like you and them. The realization of going beyond our conditioning is difficult. It's quite subconscious. Hey did you know my life is a lie? Just like yours. Isn't that sad? I still want to be one with you regardless of your lies as they are nothing but pure intentions of trying with what you have. Oh i feel like i'm going crazy about you, It's like a tornado in my heart that never stops. It's like magic. Just a sight of you and it's all i need to make my day. Just remembering your smile makes me happy inside. You are quite divine to me.. I wish i could keep you although i know you don't want to stay so all i have left is to cherish these memories before it ends as this life is temporary. ",21May2017,2
