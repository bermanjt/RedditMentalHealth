1,"In the end, all people want to talk about is themselves. Through life, we may be fooling ourselves there's a common sense to it all, but in the end, it's all about who's getting the most attention.

It's easy to feel you've built something with someone, only to be ignored all of a sudden.

It's easy to think you have a lifelong friend, only for him to treat you like you're just there, you don't matter, you are only there for him to project his problems on you.

I think I just don't really get all this socializing and life stuff. I just don't get how people can be able to care so little about each other, but at the same time, get through this existence being at peace with who they are in this way.

All this ignorance and carelessness..oh man, it makes me so cold, so broken hearted...like how I'm to find a girl for me, if I can't get anyone to be interested in my affairs, but I have to pay very close attention to theirs.

Sorry for the drunken rant, but it's so dark out here, I really hope there's a light somewhere.",12Jul2017,2
3,"About two weeks ago my [32M] girlfriend dumped me. She said she hadn't loved me in the last two years. Now she's met someone who she likes better, she's with him now. That part doesn't bother me so much I guess. The parts that bother me is how I blew my knee out about two years ago while I was working two full time jobs to support us since she didn't work. Months of physical therapy, and it hurts every time I take a step, a constant reminder of the sacrifices I made to support her. I supported her completely, I figured out once she took about 60% of my paychecks for her rent, food, and habits. So I spent tens of thousands of dollars on someone who didn't really love me, but it didn't bother me at the time because I loved her.

So now here I am, 32 years old, a bad knee I can hardly walk on, and a night shift job that I work alone at, so I never really get to meet any new people. I started online dating nine days ago, I'm on four different apps and must've sent out over a hundred messages...without a single response. I live in a small town, I work nights, I can't be nearly as active as most other guys my age...I feel like I've just thrown away my whole life towards someone who was just using me. ",12Jul2017,33
4,"I don't know exactly what I'm trying to say but just need to get this out here.  For about 1-2 years now I rarely get really excited about anything. I drift through life, mildly enjoying things at the most. For example, I enjoy movies but every time I watch one now, I don't get into it like I used to when I was younger (I'm 30+). Not a single movie has really left an emotional imprint on me, like some did when I was a kid or young adult. This also goes for other stuff I used to love. I play sports but I care much much less about winning than I used to. It's like nothing I do will elevate my happiness level above a 7,5 for longer than a few minutes. 

After working a lot (often 6 days/week) for 1,5 years, it's my vacation now. I used to always look forward to summer so much. Now the weeks just pass by. I can pretty much say the same for the whole year. It seems working all the time was partly an excuse to not have to make my own plans, actually having to think about what I'd like to do. Using work as a comfort zone to avoid contemplating my true passions.   

I've made some investments this year which have given sort-of-life-changing returns, which makes me feel just somewhat more comfortable. I should probably be ecstatic but I honestly barely feel any incentive to spend the money or know what I want with it. I could probably have millions and not feel truly excited about it. I know, traveling, experiences etc would probably be best but again, I can't say this fills me with any anticipation.  I've also lost a lot of my profits again in the past few days (although still up a lot). 

I recently dated a woman. For the first time in about 2 years  I felt like someone seemed to have more potential than just a short fling for me and not just physically. Unfortunately all those hours working hit me harder than I realized before. This probably dulled my interaction with her, she definitely liked me but I think was just missing a bit of spark. She was also potentially the best sex partner I'd had in years but I just wasn't feeling it like I should and I'm sure this influenced her too. It felt strange to have her lying in front of me and feeling horny but nowhere near as horny as I would have been a while ago. I felt like shit for a few days after she ended things because it was a missed opportunity, one I would have taken before. I'm bummed out that this might be something which I'll think about for a long time. So now my highs seem to max out at  7.5/10 (starting at 6), my lows however can still reach a 3. I have other dating options but I'm getting to a point where I'm tired of sleeping with women who don't interest me that much. I mean I enjoy the sex for the most part, but afterwards I'm staring at the ceiling in post-ejaculation clarity, realizing there have been women in my past who I liked more than the one I'm with at that moment. I'm also jaded with going through the same motions on every first date. I'm not great with women but when I put the effort in, I have reasonable success in the sense of getting dates and sexual partners. I rarely have long term relationships which is starting to bother me. I wonder if I'll be forced to date women I find 'pretty good but not great' or get dumped by the ones I really want. 

After a mostly sedentary lifestyle for the past year, I've pushed myself to the gym 3 times a week though and that does make me feel better. Deadlifting and squatting heavy weights make me feel more alive for a little while.  I also cheer up when I lie down in the park and it's sunny. Some YouTube hypnosis stuff (male confidence) slightly increases my mood too. 

I purposely cancelled a small job today to do some social things, making a conscious effort to interact with people more. When the evening was done, my bicycle was stolen. I felt like it was fitting for the past few weeks (girl leaving, monetary loss) and at the same time felt apathy. 

Don't know if anyone recognizes what I'm saying (or has bothered to read it all lol). Just wanted to write this down for myself. I don't know if I'm old for my age (my testosterone is apparently above average), need to find new hobbies  or maybe just need to work a lot less to truly feel excited about things again. I've questioned the point of being alive since I was a toddler (not the happiest child lol). I don't have or want kids, don't really believe in marriage either. So maybe I just have trouble finding a true goal in life other than making things comfortable financially and satisfying sexual urges. More importantly, there are few things I can think of that would have a big positive impact on my happiness. I don't want to spend more years just being either mildly content or sad. Would be great if someone experienced the same and has any ideas about this, especially what causes it. ",12Jul2017,1
5,"Hi everyone, im new here on reddit since today. I saw someone on google had posted a story about them feeling alone after a breakup, and they got a lot of positive responses. So i thought maybe doing the same would meake me feel better. 

So, me and my ex gf had been togeather for about 7 months and I absoloutley loved it! I had never been in a relasionship like that before and never felt so loved in my life. She was everything to me and I could do anything for her ust to make her happy. Life was better then ever and I was happy. But, then in October of 2016 she called me late at night and said se wanted to break up. My world shattered completley and all the happiness that i had felt was gone in a second. That really broke me as I still loved her so much. I fell into a deep depression and almost committed suicide twice. Ive never never experienced so much sadness and pain in my life. I usually dont get so effected by feelings but this really changed me. 

Its been almost a year since that and I still feel very sad and lonley. I dont know if I still miss her or if there is anything else, but something is missing. I generally never feel happy anymore and dont really see any point in anything. I feel very paranoid and dont do anything other then sit in my room and watch youtube.

I just miss having someone. I need someone...",12Jul2017,2
6,"Okay. So. I am still a teen at this current moment in time. However, I have feelings toward a woman that I am extremely close with. By ""extremely close"" I mean she is my step sister. I started have feeling for her soon after we met and to me she was gorgeous. But like, she was my ""sister"". But, after a family trip to Florida me and her grew close.

9,"Tonight at 830pm, I was showering and playing some music at what I thought was a reasonable volume when I heard a loud knocking on my door. I go answer the door and see a man standing there.

Man: ""Hi, would you mind tuning it down?""

Me: ""Sure. Oh, are you airbnbing? Because I live here.""

Man: ""Great, but even if I lived here I would tell you to turn it down.""

Me: ""Well, you don't.""

Him: ""Take it up with the owner then.""

Me: ""I will, have a great night."" *Door close*

Was I an asshole? I feel like airbnbers have no right to tell leaseholders anything. Maybe I'm projecting too, but it caught me off guard with how brusquely he started the conversation.

I wish I had done computer science or game design, or picked up my CDL, or done something with my life other than stay in this shitty town where my marketable skills are useless.

40,"So, ever since I can remember I have never really had real feelings or emotions, mainly the feeling that I feel ""love"" for anyone, due to bad shit happening as a kid. even though I've had multiple relationships(from a couple months to over a year) and I really enjoy spending time with a certain person, i just don't have this butterfly feeling everybody says. and now lately, I've been going on a couple dates with this girl and I really enjoy being with her, and I just want to spend every second with her, but I'm not sure if this is ""love"" or just first-stage attraction. I have never felt any ""butterflies"" but I have been very nervous for the moments before the date and stuff.

I was hoping you all would know a way how I can ""feel"" emotions etc again.
my parents divorced when I was 2, and I had always blamed myself for it(don't ask me why, I know its retarded) and this caused me to block out any emotions, I was a brick wall. 

been like that for a long time, so it just grew into me, now this doesnt mean I can't ""enjoy"" certain things, I can still have a ton of fun, can laugh at the most stupid things and have bad days, but I just don't ""feel"" anything besides happy, neutral and angry.

for example, when i'm on my bike(im dutch, figures) and its raining, I can just be on my bike not giving a single fuck about the rain while everyone else is just rushing to get indoors. it is almost like I don't care about anyone or anything.
I tried talking to therapists, which didn't help. so this is kinda my last place I can try since there is a pretty big audience here that might be able to help me out.

41,"I'm a little excited but a little scared. I got a job offer for a better paying position. This is exactly what I need to grind away and provide for my family. It's office work, I'm an accountant. I spend all day counting and reconciling money that I'll never see in my own bank account.


I sit behind this PC every weekday for 8 hours just to ensure that the hot shots up there are generating enough revenue to sit their fancy asses on a nice Lamborghini on their way home. I've got nothing against them. Their success is something they achieved with their efforts. I'm distressed because my own future looks rather bleak. I don't want to live my life as a drone. Just working away to make chump change, live day by day trying to feed my family and pay bills. I've got a four year old and by this path I cannot assure her the best of life. I mean, she will be clothed, have toys, tech, food... more than anything at least have a father because I choose not to slave two jobs and be absent from her life just to provide a little more.


What's the point of making a living if you aren't really living, know what I mean? I see people here working weekends, working from home and at work... then out of an entire week maybe have 2-3 hours for themselves. What the fuck? Is that what we are supposed to do? My point isn't that I want someone to give me money and feed me. I want to put forth the effort to generate more income than I do now in order to better provide for everyone and pay the bills and rent... but I don't want to be a slave. I mean, we exchange hours of our life for a few dollars. Money is time. Yearly or hourly. This time is being used to make the company money. Time I could have used to spend with my daughter. Time that right now I could have spent teaching her new things.

When I was in middle School, I was attracted to slight, feminine guys. Emotional and sensitive. Looks kinda like a girl. In fact, most of my crushes were gay guys.

I also thought gay guys together were really hawt. I would seek it out and watch gay porn.

Now, as a 21 year old, I do not find gay guys hot. I do not find *feminine* guys hot, whatsoever. In fact, it repulses me! 
If I even text a guy who has female mannerisms I'm like, ugh. If I see a guy wearing eyeliner, I'm like no. Talking to a guy whose bisexual is out of the question. ( I'm not a bigot, just not interested )  I like strong, manly men. 

I used to really like Asian guys. Now I don't. I went through a phase where I liked black guys, now I don't. I used to reaaally like Mexican guys. Now I don't. (In a general sense) 

When I was 16 I became sorta atheist. My mom catches wind of this and makes me attend church 3 times a week. A Pentecostal church. 
It takes a few months, but soon I am dressing like a Pentecostal girl, wearing long skirts and my hair in a bun. And convinced that almost everyone I knew on Earth was going to hell. 

I would message my best friend, with good intentions, and try to save him from hell. He told me to chill out.
 
I'm like, ""chill-out? This is your SOUL we're talking about!""

If I do not like something I say it.  I am not rude, as some may think.  If someone asks my opinion on something and I believe it will hurt their feelings I will refuse to answer on the basis that I do not want to answer.  If they insist however, then I will tell them my honest opinion(which usually ends the conversation).  When I am nervous I ramble, and make exceptionally lame puns and jokes as I have no clue what or why topics interest people.  I also go straight into a conversation, no ""hi"", ""how's the weather"", etc.

I do not understand why, but I am constantly aggravated by people.  My hair stands on end when I have to talk to people who, generally speaking, do not know what they are talking about, usually due to a lack of intelligence.  I have a low tolerance for rude people.  Many a time I have abruptly walked away from a person when I realized they were racist, etc.  However when I find someone I enjoy being around I have a terrible habit of schooling them in my entire personality, quirks, thought processes, etc. Worst part is I am aware that this is not how you make friends, yet I feel that if I do not lay out everything I am to this person, they may decide that I am not worth their time and this scares me.  

I somehow made a friend this year, despite the above mentioned method.  She is a few years younger than me, very shy, and will take any opportunity to hand the conversation to me.  I am petrified that I will lose her.  This is the only friend I have made in 6 years.  The friends I had growing up I got from pretending to be like them, and those ended fast after I gave up the act.  

Both my new friend and I have recently moved to the city and both barely know anyone, so at least we have that in common.  She lives with her sister currently, whom I do not like through some petty remark the girl had made at me due to my ""strange"" personality.
