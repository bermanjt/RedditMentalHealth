1,"They ruin my hair. Now I get it everybody's hair gets ruined from them but i have so many god damn fucking cowlicks on my head my half hour spent on my hair in the morning goes to shit. My hair fucking sucks. It makes my head look lopsided. It's going grey, and it's jet black so that doesn't help. Honestly at times I just want to fucking rip it out. I can't stand it, styling it is so fucking hard and I've been struggling with this for years. I have a cowlick on the top left of my forehead, in the middle of my forehead, on the side of my head, and on the crown. There isn't one hairstyle that works because either my hair looks all matted up and it grows in all fucking directions and it just sucks. I don't know how to deal with it, it's fucking ruining me.",25Nov2017,1
2,"When I watch TV, I've noticed that only African Americans and Latinos are allowed to keep their accent, across the board. I've seen more Asians speaking ""Standard"" than I have with even a slight accent. But I'm from small-city Michigan, and me and my friends all have almost-Chicago accents. If I want to act, I'll have to lose my accent. The same applies to guys from ""Up North,"" from Pittsburgh, from probably every city on the East Coast except New York and Boston. And southern accents are just a punchline, nine times out of ten. 

I'm not trying to be an asshole, but I went to see a production of 'Othello,' and the only guy who didn't sound at least a little like Shakespeare intended was the lead. Why the hell can't I keep my completely-understandable accent? It's not like I'm a Yooper who deletes words or whatever. I guess these questions are mostly rhetorical, I just want to vent.

NOTE: Some older Yoopers I've talked to say things like, ""You want see me later in day?"" No problem with it, but I can understand them having to lose it.",25Nov2017,1
3,"Right now I believe I'm having a partial seizure and I'd like to describe it if only for my own regard.

My mind is telling me that my heart is racing but putting my hand to my coratid, I know for a fact that it is merely fast for laying down, not even half what my brain is saying it is going. I feel as though my hands, eyes, mouth, everything is moving in slow motion. Speaking to myself out loud sounds distorted because even though the cadence of the words is normal, as I say them I feel labored and as if I am stretched thin, unable to articulate. I'm nervous to stand as turning my head makes the entire room feel as if it shifts even though I'm firmly on the couch. Writing this out is helping me gain focus possibly.

It has been almost a year since I passed out from a seizure but the partial ones are common. I don't understand them. It's like someone else holds the remote control to my brain.",25Nov2017,2

7,"I smoked weed for 8 years.  I let myself deteriorate while doing so - quit reading, quit thinking, quit *trying*.  It wasn't the weed's ""fault"" but it certainly didn't help.

I quit on 10/10/17, 45 days ago.  I'm trying to put my life back together and start trying again.

I don't know what I like anymore.  I used to like weed, and when I smoked I'd play video games or watch tv.  Those things feel like wasted time now.  I should read more, but my mind moves slowly.  I'm hoping with time and effort I can speed it back up, at least a little.

Happy Friday, friends.",25Nov2017,371

9,"(This is going to be long) So I am teenager (male) and I am in grade 11 now I would like to say I have freinds but I’m not really sure anymore. Ever since I was a kid back in elementary school I was picked on a little bit here and there, mainly I think cause I was kinda chubby and all my freinds were either tall or skinny. I always felt like a fat kid back then but I don’t think I really was, for sure I had a few pounds on me but I don’t think I should have been called flubber back as a kid, By my own freinds. It was weird cause I was freinds with them but then the would litteraly run away from me at school They found it amusing when The would run away. I knew I was doing nothing weird but for some reason they had this minor hate towards me. I was just another regular kid but I never felt like one.

By the way this feels kinda cringy typing on reddit this my first post ever but talking to my parents wouldn’t solve anything so here I am.  

Anyways when finished elementary I was actually really excited about high school cause I was stuck with my freinds that would just bully me for being fat. So making new freinds was a big thing for me. So on the first day of high school I had made new freinds and one really good freind. To remain anonymous we will just call him Greg. So me and Greg had gotten in 6 out of 8 classes together. We became really good freinds like around the first couple days of school and I was really happy cause he was a nice guy and didn’t seem like a dick to other people either. 

Now this is where I think I fucked up and I wish I could go back in time to fix. And I hate school more than anything, like doing work for grades just pisses me off. So I would go back and redo ALL OF HIGHSCHOOL  and all the work to this point to change my social life cause I hate mine and I feel like I could have done a lot better but I fucked up. 

So me and Greg used to hang out a lot and he was significantly stronger and faster than I was for the record. So here I am some short chubby kid best Friends with some hot shot new kid.  We stayed freinds for the hole year. 

And just you know my situation a little better there is a group of I would say 20 to 30 guys that we all hung out with. So I was in this group for around a while with Greg he was better at making freinds then I was. I more shy back then but I think it’s cause I was bullied so it brought down my confidence a lot when I was younger. And so as the months go by everyone is freinds with everyone and I was in a good place at this time in my life. 

Then one day I left the group just to hang with other people I knew but wasn’t very close to. These are like semi nerds (unpopular if you will say) and I became I thought at the time better freinds with them then I did with all the other guys. What I realize today is that they were better freinds and nicer to me because they thought I was popular and they were surprised I was even talking to them.
Don’t get me wrong I love these guys but I would rather be drinking out with freinds right now than playing video games with these kids. 

At this point I’m just rambling but what I’m trying to get across here is I’m a normal guy. I would say a 8/10 for looks and I’m being honest I have lost weight and gained muscle and I’m very nice like I’m never a dick to anyone st least if they aren’t a dick to me. And I feel like people think I’m weird for some reason. I always think I’m getting looks from people like I’m a freak. I’m not some kid that dies his hair pink or has a fucking peg leg but I’m just feeling excluded a lot. I don’t know if any of this makes any sense but I just wanted to let that off my chest.

13,"I’m a sophomore in high school and I moved to a new state just a few months back. It’s been really hard trying to adjust and move on because I feel so invisible at school. Every time I talk to someone and look forward to talking to them more, they just stop talking to me. Lunch at school is even worse. I have a couple friends, but since my school has 4 separate lunches, sometimes I don’t see them. I sit alone at lunch almost every other day, and it’s just so humiliating. I keep telling myself things will get better, but I’m starting to doubt it.",25Nov2017,5
15,"I was in class on my phone when I ran into a video of this girl making out with her chihuahua and she grabbed his tongue with her lips and sucked on it and the dog was trying to pull away when she finally decided to let go and it snapped back into his mouth, the poor dog. 

After watching this I had the need to show my friend, I don't know if thats just me or not when I find something but I just get the urge to share it with someone. 

Anyways, I showed my friend and he was also shocked and we just laughed over it and made jokes about it when the girl behind us asked what was so funny so I told her what the video was and she asked to see it so I handed her my phone jokingly I said ""Hot right?"" She laughed and said ""Yeah it is."" We all laughed and was interrupted with the professor starting his lecture. 

Once class ended I went and signed in in the front of the class cause I'm always a couple minutes late and cant do it before. So I'm walking out of class and the girls outside waiting for me it kinda threw me off and I stopped walking and gave her a look that anyone would know meant ""What the hell are you doing?"" So I just said ""Hey whats up?"" 

We start walking down the hallway and she smiles and says ""Nothing, I was just wondering where you got the video from."" I give her another look but this time it meant more ""What the fuck?"" And I just said I found it on Instagram. She was like oh and I laughed and joked and asked ""Why did it turn you on or something?"" And she just replies with a ""Yeah."" I didn't say anything after that I just kinda looked at her for a sec but just trying to maintain a good speed in hopes she would stop walking with me but grabbed my arm and it kinda threw me off again cause now shes really starting to worry me. 

She stops and says ""This one time I had my dog lick my pussy once I got out of the shower to dry me off."" So by this point there's two things I can say ""Get the fuck away from me"" or ""Are you serious? How long ago was this?"" So me being me, I choose the second option which in return I'm told that it just happened a couple weeks ago. 

I'm just so fucking dumbfounded that I'm like trying so hard for her to say shes just fucking with me but shes like no like deadass, it felt so good too. I wasn't going to keep this convo going any longer so I told her if it happens again to record it and she left me with an ""It will"" and she gave me a smile and walked away. I sat in my car and thinking about what just happened for a good while.",25Nov2017,40
16,"This just happened last night and I'm very confused. We were all at a pub after his band's concert and she was hanging out outside all lonely and sad because they broke up less than two weeks ago.

When I felt this way in the past nobody came to confort me and at the moment I thought it was the right thing to do, so I went to talk to her. We talked a bit and at one point we were hugging and she started telling me how she always liked me and then she told me she'd like to kiss me. So we kissed.

But then he somehow found out almost immediately and started shouting and telling me he considered me a brother and how I betrayed him. We talked a few more times and he calmed a bit, but I feel really fucking confused about this whole thing.

First of all, I wouldn't take things further with this girl, even though we both want to because I don't think it would be fair to him. So, it was only a kiss and I feel like it shouldn't matter so much. 

Second of all, I believe I should feel like the biggest asshole on the planet, but I don't feel that guilty at all.

And last, I would like to salvage my friendship with this guy because I believe we shouldn't fight and create distance between ourselves over a girl.

19,"I’m 27 year old guy virgin kissless, just getting ready for my 28th next week getting drunk and stoned alone and then the same kn xmas. I prefer to be alone as I don’t really like people’s company all that much, mainly out of fear of being judged. All year round I only go outdoors for 5 hours a week to work a little at a stadium and even that is torcher, even in that 5 hours I get Called ugly, like for example when I was having a smoke break a guy walking past trying to impress his girlfriend called me an ‘ugly cunt’ to his girlfriend and i oveheard him and she turned around to look at me while laughing hard, all I could think was ‘is that what gets girls? Nuggets like him?’, I have to remind myself that he has looks on his side albeit probably cocky about it.or when a guy at the stadium asked me here his seat was and I was helpful and polite and went out of my way to help him only for him to say to his friend ‘ugly fucker him isn’t he’and then his friend turned around smirking at me (my point is is 5 hours a week too much? Is it too much to ask just to get a few hours outdoors without being treated like sub human garbage) What really gets to me is if I so much as glance at a girl at work just trying to be polite and friendly (which is my job) and they give me a snotty look and dart their eyes away like it’s an insult to them. Everyone I know had looks and a life. Iv been in doors and alone for 2 years this week from leaving my job at a bar which I felt was like my second home, but in the end I got called ugly and bullied so much and because of it I am now where I am as a result. When I’m in doors I’m very calm mentally and can laugh and smile and play games, when I go out and be around people I come home breathing heavily and feel in so much pain and discomfort mentally, idk what to do, I even post a lot on here bothering people trying to seek approval, even if it’s just for one day it makes me feel normal.

27,"College freshman Dean’s List geek here.

I sort of have a soft “rivalry” with Brandon at my school. He’s a 6'5 frat guy who plays football, and I’m a 5'7 calculus nerd.

He mentioned that his best subject is history, and I said “Well it’s my worst, but I’ll still score higher than you at your best.”

He said why not make it interesting? Whoever gets the highest score on the midterms gets to make the loser do whatever they want that night.

I said “Are you crazy?! You’re on!”

I barely even studied. I got a 97.

My face went white in shock when he showed me his 98.

Okay fine, what stupid thing do I have to do?

He said “No big deal, James. You just have to run across the football field tonight at midnight.”

“Okay fine.”

“Naked.”

My face turned red and my jaw dropped as everyone around him laughed.

“Yeah, right. Haha. What do I really have to do?”

He said “You have to run across the football field at midnight tonight. Butt-naked. Not even socks.”

A cute girl said “Oh baby! I know my plans tonight!” and laughed as I struggled for air.

Even my friends Heather (just a friend, she has a BF) and Jason laughed.

Again, I am a huge geek. Obviously a virgin.

""You're not serious are you?""

And at midnight that night, there I was. With about 10 cheering students on each side of me, standing at the endzone of the football field. I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and dropped my fluffy, white robe to the ground.

I running across my own college football field.

As naked as the day I was born.

Wearing nothing but my glasses and the pink blush on my cheeks.

I am lily-white from the neck-down. Not fat but a “studies-while-eating-Doritos” belly shaking as I ran. My “bigger-than-you’d think” bubble butt jiggling behind me. And my…ahem…small package flapping in the breeze.

About a dozen students, Brandon's friends and a few of mine, screaming ""WOOOOO!!!! Check out that BUTT!"" and laughing.

The loudest roar of laughter was when I ran back past Brandon and he said ""Look everybody, it's the genius!"" and SPANKED my naked ass hard as I yelped out loud.

Not only was it LOUD, not only did he perfectly get me across both bare cheeks, but oh my goodness did it STING.

I just continued and ran towards my pile of clothes I stripped out of, with my bare, white butt stinging behind me and tears in my eyes from how much it stung.

I will never bet again.

QUESTIONS:

1. How old are you?

2. Does the idea of the main character being a virgin make this funnier, or no? Why?

3. What were the funniest parts for you to imagine and why?

4. Is it funny to imagine a ""genius"" get his comeuppance like this? Why?

5. Did you have a good idea of imagining his body out there? Was it a funny image, and if so, why?

36,"I've noticed a thing. I can't seem to stop crying when I watch movies or listen to music. Some songs trigger the tears, but others don't. Some movies start me quietly sniffling, but some don't. Some people have told me it's normal, some have told me it's just Winter Depression, and some have just told me it's my depression, but a few days ago it came to be an issue.

I went to see Coco with my brother, nothing crazy, and then the Olaf's Christmas short started playing. I was fine, in fact, I haven't been this happy in so long, and the line showed up, ""Maybe I should stay lost"". I was immediately wondering if I was going to need to leave the theater because I felt like bawling. I dug my nails into my palm, I bite my tongue, and I choked back sobs as my tears rolled down my cheeks.

That's when I noticed a trend. Justice League, tears. Murder on the Orient Express, tears. Listening to a cover of a Nirvana song, tears. I don't understand and I can't stand it. I'm sure that it's an issue with depression, I'm sure it has to do with my personality, but I hate it.

I don't hate my emotions, at least I don't think I do, but I think I just hate that I can't control them. They do weird things that make no sense, they sneak up on me at random moments that aren't necessary, and even worse, they seem to always be hard to deal with.

I think I just needed to talk about this and figured nothing better than to post it on the internet for a few thousands strangers to read. Thanks guys.",25Nov2017,6
