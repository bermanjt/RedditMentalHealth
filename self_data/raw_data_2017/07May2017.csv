3,"I've never met a woman I've clicked with so well before. I'm only 21 and she's 22. 3 years ago, we both met at the same university. At the time, all I was concerned with was how many women I could get with before I got my degree. We dated for 2 semesters, then I broke up with her over the summer. I didn't feel like I was totally invested, and young for a serious relationship. Spent my summer meeting women on tinder. I met some great people, but always felt sort of... uninterested? Eventually school started again and we met each other at a mutual friends party. I was completely overwhelmed, I felt like it was the first time I ever talked to a girl. Long story short, we spent all night catching up, and eventually had sex. You always hear cheesy stories about two people falling in love or hearing a song. I totally understand what they meant after that. This chick was my best friend I could do anything with, and someone I loved. Vice versa for her, she popped the L word in our 2nd year. Fast forward to now, we both were planning on getting an apt, but my parents convinced me it may be better financially to stay with them. She's moving in within a week. I literally cannot contain my excitement. I hope everything goes well.",07May2017,2
4,"Guys,

I am a software developer and I work 15 to 16 hours everyday. I don't get enough time to sleep and I sleep very late ( after 4 am). I want to join Gym but many people told me I shouldn't join because I don't have time and my routine is not good.

I think if I will join Gym that will boost my efficiency and we all know that healthy mind lives in healthy body.

Please suggest if you think I should join Gym or not.

Thanks for your help in advance. ",07May2017,1
6,"I work at a fast food location, the living embodiment of a shitty job, but you know, it gets me through school, and I like my coworkers, so I really don't mind. I just feel the need to vent what is probably my biggest pet peeve of the job, ""boy toys"" and ""girl toys."" Now to begin with I personally consider all toys to be both girl toys *and* boy toys. When I have children of my own if my boy points to a Barbie and says that's what he wants, I'll give it to them, and if my girl points to the hot wheels and says that's what she wants, I'll give it to her. Of course I respect those who chose to raise their children differently than I would, I would never tell them how to treat their children, but it silently gets on my nerves. When ringing up kids meals I always make it a point to ask what kind of toy the child would want even if I can see the child clear as day in front of me, in addition to that, I never say ""boy toy"" or ""girl toy,"" I always name the brand, ""would you like a Barbie toy or Hot Wheels?"" I always try to do so politely. You'd be surprised the kinds of reactions that I get with this simple little change of language, the most extreme that I've seen is probably one dad who grabbed his two kids by the heads, forced them to face me and shouted ""they're boys!"" and laugh afterwords. The most common reaction however is the simple and dismissive ""boy toy,"" or ""girl toy."" I've also seen parents bring back our unisex toys and ask for a ""boy toy"" or a ""girl toy"" because the toys were either blue, or they got a female character or they were otherwise seen as too feminine or masculine. 


One thing that I have noticed is that the parents of girls, mothers and fathers equally, are *far* more likely to turn to their child and ask ""would you like the Barbie toy or the Hot Wheels one."" And each and every single parent who does this fills me with absolute pride, and while yes the girl will blush and 9/10 say ""Barbie,"" it is awesome regardless, because she chose that, it wasn't chosen for her. Opposite to this however, I am disappointed to notice that parents of boys, mothers and fathers equally, are far more likely to speak for their child ""Oh he would like a boy toy."" ""Oh he would like hot wheels."" This isn't true across the board, some will ask their boys, however, most will not. We focus so much on how set back women are that we almost forget to notice how empowered they are (in western culture), parents will ask their little girls what kind of toy they want ""would you like a Barbie or Hot Wheels"" because they're fucking awesome, and I feel sorry for every little boy for whom the choice is made for them ""oh, he wants Hot Wheels."" For some stupid reason gender equality is seen as a strictly women's movement.

The point that inspired me to write this post is that this really saddens me, I am confident that this extends so far beyond meaningless and ultimately stupid little fast food toys, this in my mind represents so much more. I'm sure that parents are moderating their children's clothing, behaviors, other toys, and they are really molding how they view the world ultimately. This divide between genders is being passed on to the next generation, children so much younger than me, and they in turn will likely pass it on to their children and so on after that until hopefully eventually it fades out. But what saddens me is just that the divide still appears to run deeply and that I won't likely see it fade in my lifetime.",07May2017,3
9,"This is a pretty loaded question, I understand, but please read everything I have to say so that I can explain where I'm coming from.

I'm 21 years old currently, studying Computer Science. As I'm painstakingly preparing myself for finals, a certain thought popped up in my head about 3 days ago and I can't seem to stop thinking about it. So much so that I may actively research at some point on how to PREPARE for such a task, which I very well understand to be long, painful, and arduous. So, here's my reasons on why, for some insane reason, why I think I could make such a positive impact on the world by running for president (Again, I'm way over my head talking about such a subject, I don't know politics that well myself. I'm only seeing this in the sense that, with a certain level of passion and dedication, any individual could honestly achieve anything).

1.) I'm a first-generation Hispanic, born from 2 Colombian parents, in a ""ghetto"" suburb, the kind of town that's dangerous to walk around at 11pm. Even to this day, I don't come from a lot of money, and such a thing comes with its hardships. My dad works as a custodian and my mom's a lunch lady, so of course, I've had to get to where I am now on my own (of course, not without their help and inspiring me to work hard :) ). I feel that an important quality a leader should have is empathy and communication. Being a minority living in America, I feel that I have the skills in being able to communicate with both sides of my world. Being born to a different culture, I believe, speaks volumes when it comes to explaining your place in this country. The fact that I've been able to succeed with such limited resources, such as not coming from wealthy parents, not living in a rich town, experiencing the hardships of living in a community that is predominately violent and uneducated, tells me that I have some outstanding qualities of a leader that makes me stand out from others.

2.) I have a passion for Computer Science. Again, coming from a background where no one in my family understands science or math, and the fact that I've been able to preform well in this field on my own, also tells me something. In the regards of being a leader, another important/obvious quality is being able to solve problems, as well as resolving issues and finding the most optimal solution to a certain problem. I've studied a fair share of computer science and algorithmic problems that I feel can be applied a great deal in politics. Being able to abstract a problem out, and solve it using methods that I've learned in this field would give me an edge compared to other possible leaders. I can imagine that further down my career, I'll have a greater understanding of Computer Science and Discrete Mathematics. There hasn't been a politician as far as I know that has a background in such a field, so it would be interesting to see how knowledge of such a field can improve one's ability to resolve very complicated issues, set priorities to certain issues that need to be solved, and also have a very thorough understanding of modern technology.

3.) My personality. People seem to like me a lot. From what people have told me, I'm fun to be around, and I'm pretty smart when it comes to giving advice. I've been able to resolve a good amount of relationship issues that would occur with the friends that I've met in my life, such as a friend getting into a fight with another friend. I'm also pretty damn patient. As well as hard skinned. I've been dished out probably the worst insults and verbal abuse out of most people I know in my life, yet I'm still able to brush all that negativity aside and try to find peace with myself and other people. Then again, I can't really speak for myself, since scientifically speaking, I would be the MOST biased person when it comes to explaining who I am.

I don't want to come off as narcissistic or naive. I'm only so young to have such an aspiration. I already have plans in making Computer Science my career. Life is also very long, so I have all the time in the world to change my life at any point, maybe when I get bored of comp sci (if that ever happens haha). I also feel that, being in this field, I would have connections with tons of software developers and software companies, which would be a great resource for funding if I were ever to campaign, haha.

The main point I want to make is, I want to run for president not for the fame or power, none of that all. I'd like to run because I believe that the world truly is good, and it has the potential to be peaceful, and the ideal world where everyone is united DOES exist. All it takes is flipping the astronomical amount of 1's and 0's that exist in this system we call a country to create a much better world. Knowing exactly what issues in this country should be tackled is a problem I feel that a Computer Scientist with a vast knowledge of politics and sociology could efficiently solve.  I feel that I can negotiate and resolve issues with other nations, as I would not be influenced by money or power.

Again, I understand I may sound immature saying all of this, as I have but a vague knowledge on how the whole process works. Pretty interested to see what you guys have to say.",07May2017,2
11,"Hello, I'm not sure where to start, so I apologize if this post is a mess.

Throughout my life, I've always been a recluse. I really enjoy hanging out with friends and going out, but my alone time is incredibly valuable to me. I've never been so great with women, but since I've jumped into the dating world, I've realized that I may be kinda odd. After talking with women and having to do the texting and calling stuff, it's really exhausting. I honestly can't stand having to be in contact with someone so often throughout the day or so often in general; I will usually talk to my friends and hang out once a month, twice at most. I would really rather like to read or do something other than talk in my free time. I also really don't like it when people touch me, and I thought this sort of thing would fade with time or when I am very attracted to someone, but it hasn't. Cuddling feels very uncomfortable and I can't move much, kissing feels like a waste of time, and sex is a chore. I absolutely hate dating. So many women I have tried to date always do the ""dating game"" stuff and I don't have the patience for it (I would like to clarify that not all women are like this, I have just gone out with women whose attitudes towards dating do not match mine). At this point, it almost feels like I am pursuing a relationship because I am ""supposed"" to.

But despite all of these things, my biggest dream in life is to have a family. I often daydream about taking my future kids out and watching them see things for the first time or talking with them at home. I used to always imagine a woman with me too, but now it feels like that sort of relationship is not possible. Everyone I've talked to about it hasn't really helped, they've just asked if I could be gay and am denying it. I have questioned if I may be autistic to some degree, but I'm not very smart, nor do I have many behaviors usually associated with autism. I'm considering seeing a therapist, but I don't like opening up in that way all that much.

Does this make me asexual? I know for sure it makes it difficult to approach women because I feel like me not being interested in being physically intimate would doom a relationship with the vast majority of women. Idk though, seing as I've never actually been in a relationship.",07May2017,1

Sexual side-effects are also common with SSRIs, such as loss of sexual drive, failure to reach orgasm, and erectile dysfunction. Although usually reversible, these sexual side-effects can, in some cases, last for months or years after the drug has been completely withdrawn. 

I was lied to! I was told it wasn't possible there could be lingering side effects. 

In a study of 1022 outpatients, overall sexual dysfunction with all antidepressants averaged 59.1%. 

I was again lied to. I was told side effects are extremely rare.

30,"For example, you may have been brought up to believe that the role of a woman is a wife and mother, in partnership and service to a man in marriage, who is in partnership and service to her, however, growing up you had strong female role models who you looked up to, and ultimately you believe and assert that women and men have equal rights to self-determination, and moreover, marriage is not necessarily limited to one cisgendered man and one cisgendered woman, that there are all kinds of valid family structures...etc.

And yet, when you discuss this topic with people, you refuse to denounce traditional gender roles because as long as there is no coercion or manipulation of the situation through outside forces and both are of a sound mind, they should be able to form a traditional nuclear family where the wife stays home and takes care of the kids in a traditional and conservative way, and should not at all be judged for that.

40,"For comments on reddit, I really miss a ""look at this"" option.

From the reddiquette:

&gt; Vote. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.

I think we can all agree that nobody cares about that. I bet 99% of us will downvote if we strongly disagree. We definitely won't upvote if we disagree with something, even if we think it should be seen by more people.

I doubt this will ever be implemented, but what if there was a ""look"" option which is independent of the vote? The default ordering could be based on that, while the up- and downvotes could simpy factor into a positive or negative percentage that means ""agreement"".

For comments made before this change, the ""look"" counter could be set to be the sum of all votes, as if anyone who voted also clicked that. Or maybe just all upvotes, since it's probably more common that people who disagree with something also want to see it disappear. It's not ideal, but it would be more in line with people's intentions.

From then on, ""look"" is automatically turned on once you vote (that behavior could be changed in the settings). I would expect the following consequences:

* Upvotes and downvotes will be used the same way as before, but nobody needs to feel bad anymore about expressing their opinion.

* We can finally make a distinction between voicing our opinion and crowd-moderating comments.

* We get several new things we can express: ""I have no opinion on this, but it should be seen"", ""I disagree, but I want others to see it (and possibly disagree as well)"" and ""I agree/disagree, but this really isn't important at all""

* Interesting but controversial comments won't get hidden as quickly (it's two clicks away now), resulting in fewer people feeling silenced by an overbearing majority. That makes it easier to have a discussion with people you disagree with.

45,"Over the last few months I came to the realization that I'm satisfied with a really simple life. I don't like responsibility at all and have no ambitions. I'm lazy and introverted which results in no social life and me playing CSGO all day. But the thing is - I'm not unhappy. 

My family supports me and I know my parents love me. I think this plays an important role as this is why I'm not completely isolated.
Right now I'm almost finished with my training to a biological lab technician but I don't know if I can get or want a job in this field. I played with the idea of just getting a job as a cleaning person or something like that. I imagine it to be hard work but you go to work with an easy goal which you achieve everyday which gives you satisfaction. But maybe I romanticize that too much.   

I literally just need money for CSGO Skins except for the normal cost of living. I don't want a big house (I can't even clean my 20 sqm flat regularly) or a nice car or nice clothes because I spend my time infront of a screen anyway. Idk..

I would need to change a lot to make all that happen but I have no motivation to do so.

Idk if this can be considered an ok life because I literally don't even try at it and normally I don't think about this stuff or the future anyway.

48,"First off, I want to preface this with saying that I haven't had much luck in in any of my past relationships. Every time I let someone in, I end up regretting it. I'm all too familiar with that feeling of betrayal and the pain of being cheated on. I guess that's why this has been tearing me apart over the last year. I've found myself becoming increasingly isolated and depressed as I can't seem to find a way to move on. This isn't the kind of thing you want to talk about with family or friends, which is why I'm turning to reddit. Hopefully someone here can help.

We met a couple of years ago at work and became pretty close friends. We had the same sense of humor and had alot in common. I usually keep to myself and I definitely have trust issues so I don't connect with others, especially women, very easily. I knew she was married when we met and I can honestly say that in the beginning, the thought of her being anything more than a friend never once crossed my mind. I had been burned badly before, and I could never have even imagined being the kind of guy who would do that someone else. I refrained from talking about anything that I wouldn't want my own wife (if I had one) talking about with another guy. For instance, one time she brought up to me some of the problems she was having in her marriage. She said her husband wasn't around very much and he wasn't supportive of her. I told her she should be telling her husband about her feelings, not me. Not shitting you, I even sent her links to some self-help books on marriage that I knew my buddy had used when he was having problems in his marriage. She agreed and didn't bring it up again for the next few months. After a while, she was sent to a new location at work and I didn't see her for several months. We talked frequently via text and it was hard not to enjoy talking to her because she was just so damn funny and pleasant. While I was careful not to converse with her about her personal life, I did talk to her about mine, though I was extremely reluctant at first. This is where I first fucked up, I let her in. I told her about my previous fucked up relationships, the depression that came as a result, that I had been single for two years because I had a hard time trusting and connecting with anyone after, etc. I disclosed things to her that I hadn't told anyone. I trusted her deeply, and even then it took me awhile to get to that point. Ironically, I think the reason I trusted her was because I didn't think she could ever be more than a friend, meaning, she could never be in a position to hurt me. She also struggled with depression, and actually gave me some pretty good advice about managing it along with guidance about dating.

Several months past without seeing her and at the beginning of last year she brought up her marriage again. She had been married for almost two years and revealed to me that this was her second marriage. She said the first one ended after she caught her first husband cheating within the first year and that she met her current husband soon after, and they've been together for a total of four years. According to her, she had caught her current husband cheating on her the day after they were engaged. She said she forgave him and he's been faithful ever since. She said there were many problems with their relationship from the start and that it had gotten to the point to where they hadn't been sleeping in the same room for almost six months and rarely talked to each other in person. She told me that he was a good man, but he had Aspergers, which made him very hard to communicate with. Furthermore, that this led to him focusing on work while avoiding any other issues in his life. She said she felt like she had become his mother, rather than his wife, and that she felt that her marriage had been over for almost a year. Also, that she had tried counseling multiple times and that he wasn't cooperative with any of it and that he had blamed their marital problems on her depression. She told me she had been separated from him for almost two months now, and that she was in the process of filing for a divorce. She said that she was having trouble coping with a second divorce and that she hadn't been getting out lately. She suggested we go out for drinks one day and talk. Looking back, this was fuck up number two. I met her at an outside bar and we sat and carried on like two best friends who haven't seen each other in a long time. I had never seen her outside of work before and this was the first time I realized how utterly gorgeous my friend was. I was very guarded at first and I didn't know why, in hindsight this should have been a big red flag. One thing that was very special about her was that she could always read me very well. I tend to overthink things and plan for the worst in most circumstances, particularly in relationships. She was very calming in the sense that she had the ability to see when something was bothering me and put my mind at ease. Whenever she was around, everything seemed to be ok, regardless of what was going on. I never had experienced that sense of peace with anyone before. Things stayed platonic that day, but she was very open to answering any questions I had about her divorce. She seemed sincere in her answers and, stupidly, I left feeling assured that whatever she had with her now ex-husband was over.

We met again a few weeks later, I trusted her completely by now and I never felt closer to anyone else before. She was my best friend, and I felt myself falling and falling hard. We had a few drinks, went to the movies, and then went back to my place. I told her that I was catching feels and she told me she had felt the same way for quite some time. She told me she knew I been through alot and that she would never betray my trust or risk hurting me. She also said she wished we had met at a better time but promised me that once the divorce was finalized that we would be together. Everything felt so perfect, I kissed her for the first time that time that night and as you can guess that led to something else. Now I'm so ashamed to even say it, but the sex was incredible. We connected on every level imaginable.

She returned home, and in the months that followed things seemed to be going well. She would visit me pretty frequently, but she would never stay the night. We got into arguments like every couple does, but we could always work through anything and it seemed like we were stronger afterwards. It was us versus the world, ya know? Eventually, people at work started to catch on and it became pretty common knowledge that she was going through a difficult divorce. People knew we were seeing each other, and thought that it was ok because she had given them the impression she had been separated before she met me and was waiting to make things official once the divorce had been finalized. I became increasingly uncomfortable as time went by because she was still living with her husband. She constantly assured me that the divorce was still ongoing but that it was taking time because her ""ex"" was having trouble accepting it. She told me that his family did not approve of her and he hadn't been on good terms with them since their wedding day. She said that this was a tremendous sacrifice on his part and that she was his only family. She emphasized that she was taking time to make the transition easy for him, especially given his autism. One time, she went as far to send me a love note he had written her, as well as texts between them with him pleading for her to stay. I told her I wasn't comfortable with that, because that sort of thing is incredibly hurtful if shared with anyone else. She apologized and things continued on as usual.

I realize while writing this, that I'm making myself seem like the innocent party here. I'm not. During the six months of this relationship I blatantly let myself be deceived because I didn't want to be hurt and I didn't want to be the other guy. Life's a bitch though and that's exactly what happened. After six months, she went off with some of her old friends for a weekend. I didn't hear from her and I texted her asking if she was ok. A day went by and she texted me back saying that I needed to give her space and that my text to her made her think that she had made the wrong decision. She said her husband deserved a chance and that I should delete any pics I had of her along with any of our conversations. I was completely caught off guard, we had gone out the day before she left and had the amazing time that we usually do. She slept with me, told me she loved me, and that she couldn't wait to be mine. She used to share a facebook account with her husband before we met (yeah, like the ones where they combine their names). She deleted it a month before we got involved and made another one with only pics of her and no relationship status. She left it open on my computer the night before she left. I'm not usually a snooper, but I wanted answers. I saw she had changed her status to married and posted a bunch of her wedding photos. She had a conversation with her friend a month before saying that she was looking forward to her husband changing shifts so they could spend more time together.

I can't even begin to describe how hard this hit me. I lost my best friend and the love of my life that night via text. She even went on to say that she didn't want me to wait on her but that if things didn't work out then maybe we could still end up together. She also emphasized that her marriage was none of my business. She said that her husband knew about me and that he knew her and I had bonded ""emotionally "" but that ""he knows all he wants to know"" and that if I were to tell him the extent of our relationship that it would be unnecessary and cruel. Then she added that I, of all people, should know how that feels and understand that it's best not to know.

I wish this was the end but it wasn't. I'm a fucking idiot. I continued to remain ""friends"" with her after that. Even after she told everyone at work that I made everything up and went as far to say that I had just been stalking her all along. I even heard she told her husband the same thing when he found a picture of me on her phone. I didn't tell her husband, I really did love her and I wanted her to be happy, even though it killed me every day I thought about her being with someone else.

Hang in there folks, it gets worse. I should have cut contact with her, I have no excuse for this. Since then she has told me again she was leaving him twice and I've fallen for it. It seems like she's drawn to me every time I start picking the pieces of my life back up again. I've been intimate with her both times, and both times it lasted a week, and both times after she end it in the same way. The last time was 2 months ago. I've pretty much screwed up in every aspect of my life because I've let this take control of me. I haven't talked to her in almost a month, we don't work together anymore. She blocked me when I got upset with her and said that I felt like her husband needed to know. She said I just wanted to hurt her and that I would ruin his life if I did. I recently found out that she might be seeing another coworker of hers, that's just a rumor but the details sound very familiar.

Reddit, I don't know what to do. I'm angry with her and even more with myself for being such a piece of shit. Falling for this three times is beyond idiotic. I've paid for it. I've become incredibly depressed and isolated over the course of the last year. I'm done with dating, I was happy on my own once before and I can be happy again alone. But now I feel dead inside. I can't shake the feeling that if that was my wife, I would want to know. I still have all of our texts and pics together. Should I tell her husband? If so, How? What should I say? How much proof is too much? I've struggled with this for a while now, any help would be much appreciated.

TL;DR Fell in love with my best friend/coworker who was going through a divorce. Found out she wasn't going through a divorce, and it was just a six month affair. Left feeling Depressed, guilty, and wondering if and how I should tell her husband.
