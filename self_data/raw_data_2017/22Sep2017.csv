I like being up at night even if I'm not really doing anything, I think it's the peacefulness and solitude. Unless I am really overtired and can be asleep in minutes, I put it off as much as I can. Like right now it's 1am and I need to get up at 5 but it doesn't bother me because I like being up, and I find it hard to try to sleep. Anyone else get this? ",22Sep2017,1

3,"After ten years of trying to become one with this woman, I've decided it was time to let everyone know the struggle I've endured trying to wed the logic this guileful reticent effortlessly exhumes. Illuminated against a shiny backdrop, I chased and chased and chased a benevolence that I was never really able to, with firm jealousy, grasp and or control. 

She meticulously started with my finances, balancing her budget to straddle questionable financial decisions made until my needs were nullified, and my wants became her slaughter. Her first  personified victim was my best friend, a friend who also shared a bed with me. It didn't matter if time ticked for almost a decade with this martyr, she was going to eat me alive and get whatever the fuck she wanted.

She controlled my finances, made my significant others envy her, cost me more than I can repay and gallantly mollywhopped any enticeful motivational neuron firing that tried to persuade me otherwise. Without further ado, I present to you, the most graceful, exhilarating, delicate peccant to reach for the light while exhausting darkness to all that have known her. 

Farewell, you beautiful fucking bitch.

7,"Today was the first day in a while where I felt like I hate myself and I wanted to die. I usually just passively feel this way. You know, where you would be happy to go, but you don't want to be the one to do it. Not today. I just didn't have that will to live or succeed today. Every day is a grind.

I want to just be good enough and appreciated. I HATE how awkward I am and how I tend to make other people feel. I HATE feeling the way I do. Can't I just be normal? Can't I just be like everyone else?

I hear voices that tell me to do bad things. Not like your skitzo types, but more like an immoral conscious. I also constantly fight bad thoughts all day long. The only way I know to fight this is to try and do nice things for people and to donate stuff to charity. Maybe my fight is like other peoples fight and maybe my vice is other peoples vice. I guess I am glad that I have never acted on the stuff I think. I would rather die first. Maybe I just need a break.

Anyhow, too many deployments and too much loneliness is ruining me. Were I to die and kill myself I would be just another statistic. Another vet who had issues and wanted to end it all. I wonder who would care. It isn't the ideal way to go, but at least it is some sort of peace. I know I believe in God and Jesus. I just wish I could sit down, see my savior, and have a little talk with him. It is hard to feel this way when I know I am not supposed to, but I do.

I have always been somewhat musically talented, not much but I have been dabbling with the idea of learning piano lately

I have made a couple songs for those summer loves I've had but the idiot part of me tells me I should learn piano and make her a 15-30 min album just for her

I have the music in my mind right now, but I don't even own a piano

I already have the little booklet to put in the CD case and I know how i will sign  it as written, composed and played by me, and how on the last part I will write ""inspired by you""

Is it too weird?

I haven't talked to her in years but we got along very good

I somehow don't care if she says no, I just want her to know how I feel about her, but I can't just go and tell her that... I have to show her

I don't want to just tell her that I had always pictured her as the perfect woman for me, I can't tell her that I measure every woman I meet against her, I can't tell her how much she made me better myself just so I could feel a bit worthy of her love

I hum her songs everyday

Am I that stupid?

I don't want a day go by without her knowing that I think of her as my model of perfection

Is she my ""unattainable""? Is she just the inspiration of my music?

Will my love for her wither or will I just try and force it out pretending I can like other women like I have liked her so far?

I'm the creeper who stalks her social media and thinks of music to go with each instagram post...

I'm the one that fantasizes about her smile

13,"My mom's husband physically abused me for 10 years. When I was 16 and clueless with a boyfriend, I would go to his house after getting my ass kicked to seek safety. When I was bleeding, hysterically crying, terrified, and vulnerable, he would take my vulnerability as an opportunity to rape me.

I'm 21 now, and I'm still shaken by everything, the physical abuse, the sexual assault, feeling manipulated, everything. When I was younger, I told myself that I would grow from it all with time, but I was so wrong. I couldn't have been any more wrong. It feels like every moment I spend awake, I'm thinking about how much I hate those two guys and how it's bullshit that they didn't get any justice handed to them.

I don't want to spend every second of every day being hateful, but I can't just ""let this go."" I can't find it in any part of my being to forgive them either.

15,"I'm very much guilty of this myself, but I've noticed it a lot lately:

- The sudden growing trend of appreciation for imposing, oppressive, brutalist architecture.

- The rise of ""abandoned-porn"", ""dead-mall"" videos, the fetishizing of urban decay.

- The popularity of vaporwave, a half-satirical music genre that relies on false nostalgia mixed with the melancholic, decaying imagery and sound of 80s consumerism.

- The consistent popularity since the late 80s of the cyberpunk genre, depicting bleak, technological dystopias in literature, movies, and videogames.

Why do we like these things so much? Why is hardship so appealing? Why does it feel so good to absorb oneself in a fictional (or dramatized) misery?

19,"I've never been one to take an interest in many things, and in recent years it's only gotten worse. After going out last night and only wanting to go home all throughout, I really struggle to understand how other people can get interested in things that interest those around them but not themselves already.

Two main ideas I've seen on other forums were as follows:

 1. ""You're not looking into those things hard enough."" But why should I? A wall is a wall. Why should I care about the way it was made or the people involved in making it? The same goes for 99% of topics. You fought in WW2? Okay, sure, so what?

 2. ""You may not be interested in a topic,, but there people who are greatly interested in it. Try to understand them."" And, again, to that I say: why? Those people aren't me, so why should I care about them? If anything this is why I hate it when people around me talk too much about topics that don't interest me, and especially those I hate (such as fictional works I dislike), and I've actually been known to get angry over this. Other people like it when someone around them is passionate about something that they themselves don't necessarily care about, but for me it's an actual pet peeve and they're the people I dislike the most.

It's becoming a source of great frustration since I really don't get how other people are so different on this and it often angers me. The weirdest thing is that it mostly only applies to interests - when it comes to how they're actually doing and whatnot, and matters pertaining their personal lives, I can get a bit more interested (though it's still limited). Why would it be so different?

I've heard that I might be suffering from depression (potentially being bipolar too) and I'm inclined to agree, but after checking for a while I absolutely cannot afford to see a therapist right now as even with a decently paying job it's much too expensive over here (let alone seeing a psychiatrist).

Recently, one of the guys we know irl (who i'll call T) fell out with me (over racist stuff but that doesn't really matter rn). So the rest of the group came to my defense and T got kicked, and now our relationship is weird, bc he wants back in but at the same time doesn't want me and another person in it. So things are strange within the group and tensions are relatively high. More importantly, one of the extra guys (P) we added got kicked by 2 guys (who ill refer to as J and M) (M was the other one T wanted to kick, just in case you were curious) since they found him annoying. AND NOT ONLY 3 DAYS AFTER THE WHOLE INCIDENT WITH T. So now one of us (N) are pissed at J and M while I'm pretty sure the last two have no idea what's going on. Just in case you could actually tell from this horribly written rant (sorry reddit) the remaining 2 guys, me and someone ill call F, are stuck in the middle of this shitstorm with no idea what to do.

Edit:
So i just learned that P had apparently asked M for nudes (He apparently did it once and one side says it was a joke while the other doesn't. I'll try to get to the bottom of this) and that's why her and J jumped the gun and kicked him from the chat (J openly admits that he was too hasty btw). And N is pissed because she is sick of kicking everyone we don't like and just wants to stay friends with everyone (that and how J and M are essentially dictating the server in her opinion).

28,"As this particular memory haunts the sleepless night, I share a mundane lesson that I learned. 

It was during a middle school P.E. (gym class for those unfamiliar) class. In one of the rare moments during winter, when the sun shined and no rain clouds were in sight, we played capture the flag. The air brimmed with hormonal excitement with the perfect mix of unmistakable axe body spray. I gazed into the opposing field as I planned out the most optimal strategy. I was neither quick or strong, so brute forcing an offense or defense would yield no result. Then it hit me. 

Even their best offensive player has to stop in the small designated area on our side in order to pick a flag up! All we had to do, was mark whoever goes into the flag zone, and play a game of Mexican standoff!

Except I was an especially socially awkward loner, and kept this *genius* plan to myself. And I was so awestruck by how successful this plan would be, that I forgot it's just a fun P.E. class activity. 

So instead of inspiring my team to victory with my *flawless* defense, what happened was that I targeted one of the best players on the opposite team (read: the most enthusiastic 7th grade boy) and utterly ruined that game for him. 

From when he arrived at the flag zone to when the game ended 20 min later, I trapped the adrenaline pumped middle schooler, who only wants to simply run around on the field and have fun, in the tiny designated area at the back of the field where nearly no action happened. During the 20 min it took to end the poor kid's misery, I menacingly circled around the tiny plot of land, calculating the perfect spacing between him and me to stop any possible escape. All while I had the stupidest shit eating grin on my face. And all while being silent and brooding, since I was an awkward, socially inept middle schooler. I have not since seen someone go from such pure energy of excitement to a black hole of life in that short amount of time. ^We ^^won ^^^though

Anyways the obvious point, that probably does not need to be stated, is that sometimes winning isn't everything.",22Sep2017,2
29,"Sorry if this is a bit long, but its basically what has been continually going through my head the past few days.


I don't think I consider myself to be depressed because it's not like I can't get out of bed or anything, but I feel like I'm heading towards that way and I really want to avoid it.


I'm 18, male and I just started University (I'm in England now), arrived a week yesterday. I come from a decently small island off England, its not stupidly tiny but it has the population of a small-ish city. However I'm almost certain that my issues haven't come from making this leap, since they all also existed at home, I could just avoid them since I was around family a lot of the time and around some friends I've had for a long time.


I guess here's where I'll start explaining why I think I'm becoming depressed. Firstly, I just feel like I'm a really boring person. Its not that I'm socially anxious, I don't even think that its that I don't have enough hobbies or whatever the normal response to this ailment is. There's these people that are always joking around, having a laugh, pissing about and having a great time in my flat. I sit with them and laugh at their jokes, but never contribute anything. Its not that I have things in my head that I want to contribute and I'm too anxious, its that I literally don't know what to say. 


This means I've got the choice to either force myself to say something and it almost always ends up not being funny and kills the mood, or I don't say anything at all and just sit there, smiling at their jokes but adding literally nothing to the interaction at all. Why would anyone want to hang out with a person who adds nothing to the conversation, so they just don't. When someone finds a funny video on their phone, they point it to everyone except me to show them, even though I'm sitting right there. I know these people and I don't think they're dicks or anything, they seem like alright people, the issues are on my end. I went to Aiya Napa with friends from home in June, and everyone goes around playing pool, going down to have lunch, etc. Even when I tried to get up and play pool, nobody ever really wanted to play with me. People would ask by name if anyone wanted to go get food or something, I didn't get asked once. 


You can say that this is because 'everyone else is a dick', but to paraphrase the saying, 'if everyone around you 'is a dick', maybe you're the issue'. 


I really do try to be fun, but as I said before, I literally don't know what to say in order to be fun. I'm not sure if I've got something wrong with me, I haven't got the experience, I've never really had a best friend or anything of the sorts (I've never had a friend who was closer to me than they were to anyone else). The guy who I was closest to a long time ago, maybe I was one of his top 3 friends, moved into a druggy crowd of people and I wasn't willing to follow. 


I'm really rambling now, but its the complete lack of anyone to talk to at University compared to going back to my 'safe space' at home with my family. I couldn't have asked for a better family, my mum dying of cancer when I was 15 may not have help my issues but from what I can remember I was just as bad beforehand, but my Dad is honestly the best dad I could have asked for. He's the only one I've told about this, and I feel bad for doing that since its only going to worry him and there's no way he can have any idea of what to do about it, he's not a psychologist. He told me he was quite similar when he was my age, but he left school to work in a factory at 16 so he got out of his shell a lot in there since he didn't really have a choice.


So that's the main issue I'm having. And then there's other ""smaller"" ones, such as me not having any idea what course I want to do at University despite me already being here so I chose a broad course (Mechanical Engineering) in order to try and get somewhere, me always being 'the smart one' was my thing yet I only got BCC in my A Levels (Predicted AAA) and people with all of their other attributes being better also did far better in grades, me asking my dad to spend £1200 on a surface pro laptop for University when I don't even think I'll need it anymore and its not good enough to play a lot of video games so I can't even safespace with that.


I don't think I'm homesick since I had these issues at home, but knowing I can't just pop back home on a train (Gotta take 2 taxis, a train and a flight to get home) and I'm completely alone doesn't really help me. 


For fucks sakes I've never really told anyone this before, but its all coming up. I guess I'll stop with my stream of consciousness now and see if anyone has anything at all that they can say to help me. I'll do anything at this point.


Thanks.",22Sep2017,2
30,"I have noticed a trend in people throwing around all sorts of labels to describe themselves. And the same people forcing those labels are the ones complaining about unity and equality.  Yet, they don't realize that by throwing around labels; ""libfem"", ""radfem"", ""red-piller"", ""MRA"" they are just putting emphasis on your differences instead of focusing on your commonalities that are what make it easier to empathize with your fellow human.  

It is so much easier to get mad and name-call instead of showing empathy and talking it out.  Being patient and having a truly open dialogue from both sides of whatever discussion is definitely difficult at first, but the more you genuinely talk and LISTEN the more you can understand and work to resolve an issue.  

Momma always told me, ""if you don't like someone you should start asking them how they are everytime you see them.  And listen when they talk, doesn't have to be long.  Slowly you will find it easier and easier to empathize with someone you never really thought you could.""
It is amazing how much less pissed I get at people by doing this.

It is incredibly easy to take it personally when someone disagrees with you-  but you really shouldn't.  Would you take it personally if your favorite color was green and I didn't like green?(oversimplified, I know)  Everyone has completely unique experiences that made them who they are and we form our reality and opinions based on those experiences.  

I am completely up to changing my opinions on things-  if the alternative to my belief is logical and well reasoned, not just an appeal to emotion.  So many people want to attempt to appeal to emotion to sway your beliefs and that is where that side of a discussion breaks down.  You want to change someones thoughts?  Focus on what can be shown- studies are a big help when discussing things that are easy to set off an emotional response.  If all/most scientific evidence points in the opposite of your belief- it doesn't mean you are wrong for feeling you disagree- but you are wrong if you don't even consider a change to your belief.  You are never wrong for feeling a way about something.  You are entitled to feel.  You are wrong if you continue to push a false/unfounded agenda​.  

I just have read some super cancerous threads on reddit lately and I wish more people realized how to structure an argument.  

""I don't like X, because when X happens sometimes Y happens and I really don't like Y. So nobody should be allowed access to X.""

The problem here is that lots of people like X that never do Y.  So X&amp;Y seem to correlate, however the fact that plenty more people have exposure to X and never do Y than vice-versa shows that in all probability ""X does not cause Y"".

This is the most common argument form I see anywhere, especially on here.

That does not mean that reddit causes people to make these flawed arguments, it just means that people make these arguments and some people are on reddit.  

I hope I have made this clear if anybody even reads this.  My anxiety/insomnia/OCD have me up way too early obsessing over things that barely matter but I have to write it out.  Even if I delete it later.",22Sep2017,20
31,"I'm in my late 20's but I've experienced what it's like to lose a family member or friend many times.  Keep in mind that I'm not asking for sympathy, I'm sharing these experiences because death has taught me a lot and I want to share that with you.  I've lost grand elders in my family like a few grand uncles, grand aunts, and I've lost my grandfather on my dad's side.

However, I've lost younger family members such as my cousin who died from cancer at 17 then his mom, my aunt, died of cancer just a few years later.  She was only 48.  On top of this, I've lost a few of my friends through car accidents and other tragedies.  Like one of my best friends who died riding his motorcycle.  

I can go on and on about the people I've lost but what I've learned is what my true goals should be.  Let me explain.  When someone dies, the person's friends and family gather together to remember who that person was.  Every detail of that person's life is carefully examined and discussed.

Then that person's friends and family come to one of two conclusions:

* 1: The person lived a full, happy life.  That person spent their life pursuing what they wanted.  When that person's friends and family come to this conclusion, they become happy that they lived life on their own terms.  No one has any regrets.


* 2: Just the opposite; that person died before they were able to pursue what they wanted.  They didn't live life on their terms and didn't have a shot at happiness.  People think the person died too soon.  Then their loved ones are filled with regrets.  They feel they could have done something to help that family member pursue what they wanted.

What's especially interesting is people can have these feelings regardless of the dead person's age.  I've had old family members die and we lament that he/she couldn't pursue what they wanted, we think they died too soon.  I've had young friends and family members die but we rejoice that he/she lived the life they wanted.

My friend who died in a motorcycle accident died when he was just 22.  Yet, I admire how my friend did what he wanted to do.  His life was short but it was filled with joy and prosperity.  

But I've learned that true joy and prosperity has nothing to do with money or material things.  True joy and prosperity is the pursuit of **your** happiness.  Many people become lost and pursue six figure incomes, fancy cars, and large houses because they think that's the only way they can convince people that they are successful.  You may achieve this if you work hard enough, however, you'll be unhappy living a life to please and impress others.

The people who stick to their convictions and live consciously are the true prosperous people.  Your family may not understand what you want and who you are but in the end, they will respect it.  But here's where we become lost, when people question your lifestyle and choices you may succumb to peer pressure.  Peer pressure that will lead you to live a life they can accept and understand; a life that isn't yours.

I want to be a rebel, I want to live a life that meets my expectations.  So when I die, I want my grandchildren to say ""Grandpa i_stay_turnt was such a badass.""  What do you want your legacy to be?",22Sep2017,1

Basically, I am finishing up my second semester (of my first year) in Property and I applied for a Bachelors in Commerce in another uni (not as high ranked as my current uni). 

My parents are paying for my tuition fees (I’m an international student) and they are willing to do it, with some displeasure, but I’ve begun to doubt myself. 

Initially, I was certain about my change to Commerce because there’s a higher likelihood of getting a job and good pay, and I genuinely don’t mind the course (there’s really nothing else I’m willing to study because I don’t know what I want but I grew up around Commerce and did all the Commerce subjects in high school). And I chose my current course only because my results were awful so I didn’t have many options so I don’t necessarily love it. But a few family members think I should just stick with my course and finish it off because it’s a good course and I will have a better future with it and they keep asking if this change is what I really want, which makes me keep doubting if that is what I really want. I don’t know what to do anymore since I am worried about job prospects, income etc for my future.

35,"I screwed up.  I started to make a bloody Mary to help me get over the ol' brown bottle fever, but I am out of mix.  I swear I had tomato juice or mix somewhere, but nope.  Now I have vodka on the rocks with hot sauce, pickle juice, Worcestershire, bitters, and spices.  Do y'all have any recommendations for what to mix it woth?  I'm thinking beer or margarita mix would be ok.",22Sep2017,2

37,"I've had a very shit year. 

My Mum was diagnosed with cancer around a year ago, she went through 2 surgeries and a round of radiotherapy. I went home to help her get to her radiotherapy and she insisted I worked from their house so I didn't have to take any holiday for it. Work are really great and were fine with it. 

Also around a year ago my partner started having sciatic like symptoms. It took him a long time and my private health care to get diagnosed with a massive slipped disc. He needed spine surgery about 2 months ago. 

A few days before Christmas last year we got a letter  from our estate agent giving us two months to vacate because our landlord was selling. We moved right before I had to go to America for a week with work and was exhausted. Then we discovered we have an aggressive alcoholic for a neighbour who shouts and swears at his wife every weekend. My fingers have been over 999 more than once. 

My job was really getting me down among all of this. I was taking on more responsibility and doubting myself constantly, to the point of quitting. 

My Dad went onto antidepressants this year. I went back on antidepressants this year. My parents had a massive row just after I left home after a visit and my sister was still there. My dad stormed out for 2 hours and I woke up to 12 missed calls from my poor sister wondering if she should call the police. 

Now... In the space of a few weeks... 

My parents seem good. I spoke to them both on the phone today. 

My partner is doing really well and his latest MRI shows massive improvement, time will heal in the end.

My mum is looking cancer free, she has a final check up this month.

Our new house is fine and our nice neighbours who have heard all this before told the aggressive neighbour to shut the hell up. We haven't heard him since. 

My sister has a great job and is doing illustration in her spare time. We had gin and tapas at the weekend.

I've run several 70+ people events this year and done them well. I got given champagne at the end of one. I've won an award at work. And today I've been offered and accepted the content writing role I applied for internally. 

I'm still on antidepressants and they do me good. 

I'm opening that bottle of champagne tonight!

38,"And I got to suck tit. It was awesome. The best part was that sje was super into it the whole time. I have never had a girl this into me before and it just feels so great. this was right before class and it was classtime and she didn't want to leave the stall.  

Sorry, idk who else to share this with, im just hyper as fuck rn and just wanted to get this off my chest",22Sep2017,0
42,"And I have no one right now to share that with. My boyfriend and I are probably gonna break up very soon and he just left after a horrible talk. For some reason, after he left I put on Blink 182, specifically Always, I Miss you and Adam's Song. I don't really listen to music anymore and Blink were never a huge favourite, I mean, I adored them as much as any self respecting teenage girl who wore baggies and hung around skate parks should, but my true fangirl heart was for more emo bands.

It didn't make me feel better but it made me feel more than just pain. All The Small Things is on now.

I just don't know what compelled me but it's nice, it's just nice that I turned to them, and I wanted to share that.",22Sep2017,70
44,"Today would've been day 14, but I went to my apartment's front office to pick up a package, and they had a plate of cookies on the front desk (as they usually do). I absent-mindedly picked up a cookie and started eating it, and it wasn't until I got a little more than halfway through with it that I realized what I had done. Since it wasn't exactly an intentional slip up, I'm not sure if I should start all over with day 1?",22Sep2017,2
45,"I wanted to take this off my chest and see if there are any other people experiencing similar feelings about the situation I am in.

Like the title says, I am doing too many things on the side. 

I work a full time job, doing a lot of overtime and saving up a decent amount of money. I am on the 2nd place for efficiency and customer feedback ranking from 350 people. 

I have a bachelors degree, but I am not happy with my job since no one else has one.

Other than my job, I do the following things outside: 

• Looking for another more specific role in marketing or advertising/consultancy that will actually help me in the future with transferable skills.

• I do photography and have kind of established instagram profile which has more than 10K people. The good side is that I made a lot of friends through Instagram.

• I recently started working remotely with a company in the States as a ""recruitment consultant"" (it does not add to my resume and there are no work references to prove this, and no contract). The job is email marketing basically, pushing emails and making phone calls form the UK to the US.

• I want to change the place I live in, because I really dislike my current living situation (living with 7 strangers in an old 70s house in northern England)

• I constantly try to improve, but looking into the environment around me depresses me and I find myself in bed with anxiety and full head just scrolling through Reddit. 

• I go to the gym and run 3/4 miles almost every day. 

Today, I said to myself that I will cut some of these things and focus on max 2 of them in order to improve. 

I have been doing a lot of side ""jobs"" (by this I mean, some very specific roles like email marketing, content marketing, web developing, editing photographs, paid photography), but nothing adds up to my portfolio. Nothing is worth doing. I haven't been paid from this company since I started (I am just doing the 1st project now), but I have been doing content marketing stuff for the owner.

Last month, I wanted to apply for Canadian Immigration, calculated my points and I don't even qualify to apply. With all those things I am doing and all the different skills I have, I actually don't have any track record of things that can help me to better my life. They are all so different that nothing matches. 

If I want to make a resume, I only include one of these things. 

Not to mention that all of my actual jobs sound very sophisticated like ""personal banking consultant, operations supervisor"" when in the end, these were either internships or customer service jobs, which won't qualify me for anything. 

I wanted to take this off my chest and I hope someone has some advice to share if you have been in a similar situation. 

I am 23M graduated with a 1st Class Honours as an international student, working 1 job, but doing 5 things on the side, which doesn't help me in any way for my future in terms of having an official track record.

Apologies for the grammar and vocabulary. ",22Sep2017,4
46,"Everyone I’ve met thinks I’m weird. Socially I just don’t function like everyone else. I try to be normal and I still get labeled as weird. This happens within seconds of meeting other people. 

I’m about to graduate college and I’m stressed that this weirdness will prevent me from successfully fitting in to the corporate world or even land a job. I interned at a large company this summer and fairly quickly got labeled as weird and isolated by the 30+ interns that were there. I used to be the really quiet kid in high-school but I’ve made an effort to change that by talking to people. Now I talk to people and then just get labeled as weird :/. For example, today I was at an event a company was hosting and I sat next to a student from another school. I introduced myself and just made small talk. He moved to another seat during lunch and I heard him say that “he’s weird” as the reason for moving. I hate this about myself but I can’t seem to change it. I’ve actually noticed it get worse because people seem to label me as weird much faster than before. This also prevents me from making any kind of connection with another person. I have no friends and I’m alone all the time. It sucks....",22Sep2017,13

50,"I was warned as a child and as an adult I warned my children that a single decision can have lifelong consequences. Today it occurs to me that those consequences do not have to be negative.    

This is the anniversary of something that has changed my life forever. September 22, 1987, 30 years ago today, my Mom told me to get a job. She even had a suggestion she had cut out of the classified ads of the newspaper.  With no other goal but to make my mom happy I applied. I never expected that I would also be hired and begin work that day. I could've never imagined that I would work in the same field every day for the next 30 years and now even beyond.  I certainly didn't expect to meet the woman that I would marry as soon as I possibly could convince her to do so.  Like I said, my only goal was to make my mom happy I think I did that.  I never imagined how happy it would make me though.  We have raised three great children into adulthood, added an awesome son-in-law, and now we get to celebrate the day by spending it with our grandson.  I wouldn't change a thing.  A good reason to listen to your mom.",22Sep2017,26
