1,A month ago I just got my first full time job and I'm feeling a bit depressed. I just can't imagine living the rest of my life like this. I wake up early around seven. 45 minutes commute. Spend about 8 - 9 hours at work. Get home by 7. Off to bed by 10 or 11. For five days. The weekend just speeds past until I'm back to that same schedule. How do people do this? I think I'm just so used to the free time I had at uni that this kinda lifestyle almost feels limiting and monotonous in comparison. Its so weird as this how 99% of humans live and everyone just seems cool with it. How?,22Oct2017,2
2,"Fuck waiting around to start doing it.  I'm starting **right fucking now. Yep.  On a fucking Saturday night.**


I scheduled my GRE. I emailed professors for letters of recommendation, and I've got a post-it note of 6 schools that have deadlines in 2 months.  I'm gonna bust my fucking ass until it falls off and get this shit done.  I know I can do it.  I've just been too lazy. 

Fuck being lazy.  Two months of pain and I'm home fucking free. ",22Oct2017,34
3,"I hate how I look.....they told me that I will be ""better"" after taking my medication - they were right,  but I don't like it. I **want** to be ill and sick and thin. If I find I can't be anorexic again, I'll just stop taking my meds.  Maybe then I can be happy again. Right now, I feel a mixture of happiness and stability along with hurt, doscontent, and sadness. Even cutting doesn't feel as good anymore unless I constantly replace them with a sharp, new, blade. Unfortunately,  I am also running out of room to cut. So far, I've just beem cutting my stomach area near my pelvis; I find it bleeds more is more painful there. Also, I've found a better way to hurt myself: Purposeful bruising. I can just smash whatever area I want with something hard and I get that sweet feeling of writhing on pain. Words can't explain how good that feels! The only thing I need to do now is be able to do it harder or find a hammer of some sort. Luckily, I will be getting a job soon, so I can finally purchase what I want. Maybe if I earn enough, I can get a scalpel and manually remove whatever part I dont like! Maybe life really isn't that bad after all. :)",22Oct2017,1
7,"I'm laying here unable to get out of bed so I don't have to listen to my roommate and his gf fucking. It's just making me sad. Been single for over a year now and have only been met with rejection after rejection.

I know it's stupid to complain about only a year. I have guy friends (am a girl) that haven't been with anyone for years and years but still it sucks. I miss affection, i miss holding hands, i miss snuggling up to someone when it's cold out. 

I turn 27 in a few months and I feel like if i can't find anyone by then I should settle in and accept i'm going to be alone forever. I've only had one relationship and by the end of it, it was pretty clear he never felt any real love for me. I should just accept i'm unlovable. ",22Oct2017,72
8,"For a long time, I thought I was. To some extent, I still think I am. I think that when I really want something, I can push myself to do it. But there's nothing I want to push myself to do. The concept of being motivated and driven to be a great or even just good athlete, musician, photographer, or whatever just seems so alien to me. Even just honing a skill like cooking or calligraphy or rock stacking or DIY seems completely foreign.

I like doing things, but I don't love doing things. There's nothing I feel strongly enough about that I want to commit myself to it. I made efforts when I was younger to be appreciative and optimistic, to see the good in all sorts of different activities, cultures, hobbies. I feel like in my efforts to like everything, I never let myself fall in love with anything.

I feel tired of such mediocrity. I want to be able to be proud of myself for something. I don't necessarily want fame and fortune, I just want to be good at something. To be able to make impressions on others. I want to be able to say ""this is what I do"". It doesn't have to be for a living, just a hobby would be fine. I want to be able to dedicate myself to something. 

I've been thinking about this lately, and there's nothing I can do. Not that there's nothing I can do to solve the situation, but that I don't have any skills or talents. I don't draw, paint, write, carve things out of wood, take pictures, or garden. I don't know much about cars or programming or the outdoors. I'm not passionate about protecting endangered species or preserving nature, I'm not a champion for the destitute, I'm not doing research to prevent disease.

I have nothing I can take pride in, but I don't know how or to what to apply myself. I want this to change.",22Oct2017,26

11,"A few months ago I stubbed my pinky toe against some object, can't remember what exactly, and thought nothing of it. Now wearing ordinary shoes cause me serious discomfort. I'm assuming that the impact may have caused the bone to fracture or something of that sort but find it futile to go to the doctors since so much time has passed and not much can be done about it. Am I wrong to think so? Any advice on what I can do and how to find comfortable shoes?

19,"I'm in a pretty bad place right now, and for a while now, this last year especially. Some pretty terrible things occurred psychologically for me, and I moved to a new country trying to get a fresh start. Ive experienced intense social humiliation, which has been a disaster for me, and is something i'm still trying to recover from.  
 
I have been focusing on heath and the gym as a way of coping, and have got in good shape and healthy, but still have no friends here, and very few anywhere for that matter. I often spend whole days sat in my grim rented room, and regularly go without speaking to anyone. I work on my computer and apart from the gym and a one on one language class, dont do much beyond walks in the park. 

I realise this isnt good, and dragged myself out to a local bar for a quiet drink. I often go for one drink (no more than that) at night just to get out the house, and sit by myself. 

Last night there was a party in there and i got talking to some people. One guy and a girl who he was with were acting weird and kept pulling at the string on my coat. I asked him whats he doing, his friend then asks me if i was gay. I said no, as i'm not, the other guy said he (the first guy) was and seemed to suggest he was keen, i told him i like girls, but each to their own, people laughed and that seemed fine. 

Anyway people were laughing and being friendly and it didnt seem a big deal. i continued chatting to others and the bar staff and it was a good evening. I stay drinking at the bar and chatting to the others for around an hour.

Then i go out, smoke a cigarrete with one person, come back in and the guys there, i go to walk past him and pat his arm to say 'excuse me' as i was walking past, and he straight out attacks me. Pushes me, then hits me on the side of the head. I'm saying 'what the fuck are you doing', his friends push him away and tell me to go. I go out the door and say to the people 'he just attacked me for nothing', and the guy runs out the bar, charges into me and knocks me onto the ground. the others pull him off again, i say again to the barman who's come out 'i didnt do anything, he just attacked me for nothing' he says 'go go, just go'. So i leave. 

I wasnt hurt and it's not a big deal in itself, but compounded with the loneliness and depression i'm feeling right now it's really knocked my confidence and self esteem. It's the first time i've gone to a bar and been sociable for around 6 months now, and that happens. 

The guy is clearly a douche, and the whole event was triggered by him, but still i cant help feeling that this shit keeps following me around. He and the girl he was with clearly took some dislike for me, and then that continued and he drank more. I dont know. But i also dont know what he's saying to others about it, as i cant see WTF his justification was for attacking me like that. Clearly it's not reasonable and the guys an angry prick, but how do i know what he's tellling other people about it? 

Anyway i now feel more stifled, paranoid and anxious than before. I wont go to that bar again, but this is a fairly tight community around here and being a foreigner and always on my own i feel like i may run into them again. I dont feel under threat physically as i can take care of myself, but it's just the paranoia and judgement, and not knowing what caused the attack, or his motives. 

I feel disliked and toxic right now. Like everywhere i go people seem to take a dislike to me. I am self aware enough to know the textbook response should be to not let this get to me, but honestly it has. It feels like it justifies my introvert nature, and makes me distrust people and social situations more. 

I have zero friends here, and no one i can discuss it with. I speak to my parents once a week or so, but dont want to say anything to them about it as it may worry them. 

As i say the fight itself was nothing, no damage and i dont care about the physical side. It's just the psychological. I really feel like shit right now, and that's compounded it all. It feels like there's threats all around me - again not so much physical more alienation, judgement and being disliked. 

I'm late thirties and the guy i'd guess was similar btw. This is the first time something like that has happened to me for 20 years or so. The bar is a typical local place, a friendly crowd, not rough or anything special. 

Sorry if this is long and rambling, had to vent about it somehow. ",22Oct2017,95

I hope I get over trying to please people too, I get screwed over a bit and I'm not trying to screw other people over but yeah.

What made me write this post is that the Logic song about suicide came on and I hate it, I'm not saying it doesn't help some people but to me it's annoying. I feel empty, aimless, without meaning. Cheesy songs or quotes aren't going to help anything other than make 14 year olds act deep.

28,"I've always been quite lost in life but never as much as I am right now. I grew up with asian parents who made their way out of poverty through education. So in my house education was always considered important but my parents weren't as strict as other asian parents/the general stereotype that exists. When I was younger I wanted to be a vet or an author. As I grew up I started thinking about being a doctor because I wanted to help people using my knowledge. So thats the path I took and it has been a long and tumultuous one. I'm 2 years away from graduating but am struggling a lot and have no idea if its what I want to do anymore.

4 years ago I started dating my now ex. He worked in the 'creative industry.' Before him, I had no idea what this was. I didn't know these kind of jobs existed and I definitely didn't know I could do them. I slowly discovered this group of people based in the main city in my country that are all doing creative things and they ALL know each other. Anyone remotely successful is part of this group. They all follow each other on social media and go to big events together such as adidas or nike parties. They drive diversity and culture. You know how you have certain groups of people throughout time who are revolutionary in terms of art, music, fashion? Well thats these guys. Think the punk era but this is so much better because there is so much diversity and most in the group are people of colour. The whole premise is about being different not all the same. But its hard to be different when there's already so many different people already, wheres the niche? Its not based around social media, thats just the way that I access it - from looking at multiple profiles and seeing how they all know each other and also seeing the work they're doing which is amazing and I wish I could be a part of it. But I'm studying 3 hours away. 

I spend hours looking at these people and there work and I desperately want to be a part of it. But I don't know what 'creative' thing I would do. I've thought of being a stylist or photographer but I don't know if this is even what I could do and I don't think I'm good enough at it. 

I did some modelling but I don't even know how I got those jobs because I am NOT unique looking at all. I mean I wish I could be a model and I think if I actually was model material I could be quite happy doing this until I figured things out. Its a good stepping stone because you constantly meet people who are part of this 'group.' I recently did a shoot and met a girl who was part of this group and I vibed with her unlike anyone else . We had similar interests and thought the same way. But the thing is she's already in the group and kept saying how so many people suck up to her to get into the group and meet big fashion people that she knows. She already has so many friends so I wasn't able to make friends with her after. 

Everytime I feel like I'm good at something I look at the people who actually have thousands of people following their work and huge success and I realise I will never be that good. These people are superior and I don't even think I would be able to hang around them. 

I met all my exes friends who were also in this industry, one such friend was a girl (lets call her Sash). Sash is a singer but at the time I met her her music was not doing well. She was doing other things like modelling to earn money. I used to feel quite jealous of her because she just had this air of cool about her. She always dressed so cool but made it look so effortless. No matter how hard I tried to look cool she would always look so much better but like she hadn't even tried. She had this amazing energy and I wanted to be friends with her. But my ex told me she had no friends and even she said this sometimes. 

Its been a year and a half now since me and my ex broke up. Sash is doing amazing. Her music is doing well, she's instagram famous and she's friends with loads and loads of famous people. She's friends with people in this creative 'group' that I thought was impossible to access. She has loads of friends and I constantly see her in everyones instagram. She went from no friends to being friends with some of the most amazing people. I find it all so strange and creepy that I have been stalking all these people for so long and now someone I know actually is friends with them?! At the same time I do feel like I get it because she always was so cool. So its natural other cool people gravitate towards her. Her music is amazing and I feel so jealous of her. 

If I could do anything in this world I would do music. But I don't have the natural talent like Sash does. I didn't grow up on music like all these people I follow on instagram who have been doing it since they were kids. I can't sing I'd have to do rap. A part of me thinks I could do it but deep down I know I would be terrible. I just love the idea of music. Of someone listening to my music and it making them feel a certain way. Of people being able to share in my work. I also love the lifestyle that comes with it and the talent that really is not comparable. People respect a musician's talent more than anything because EVERYBODY can relate to music. Music is power over anything. 

I am passionate about clothes but I'm not passionate like these people are. Growing up in the environment I did made it hard to be creative. But then if it was my true calling would it have happened regardless? I've always been into clothes I just didn't know I could do something with that. I want to do all these things but I don't have the resources or at least I'll be passionate about the idea but never have any idea how to get it going and then I lose interest and do nothing. 


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I'm so lost in life. I have no idea what my calling is. A huge part of me wants to do music but I have no natural calling for it its just my dream job. I wish I had a talent or a huge passion for something. I don't know what to do and I don't know how to find out what I want. I have no clue what would make me happy and sometimes I wonder if I have a desire to be adored by others. How do I get rid of this? I don't know who I am or what I want from life. But worse than that I don't know how to figure that out. ",22Oct2017,1

41,"Hi Reddit. Just another guy here complaining about being rejected. Sorry, but I really need to vent right now, and some advice or comforting words would be really helpful.

So, I went on a date with a girl today. We met on Tinder a couple weeks ago and have been talking almost nonstop every day since. We've been clicking well and I could really see myself getting close with her.

We had a date today, our first in person meetup. I was so nervous. I stumbled on words a lot and I could sense she wasn't completely comfortable. When I dropped her off at her house, I knew it didn't feel right. The date seemed fun but...off.

I text her when I get home to tell her I had a good time. She replies, tells me she did too, but it isn't going to work. Basically, she doesn't find me attractive.

This hurts, reddit. Like I know I'm not the most attractive guy. I get few matches on Tinder, and even fewer from girls that are actually attractive. Few message me back. And only a handful keep a conversation. And none like the girl from today.

The sad thing, is I've actually felt somewhat good about myself the past couple days. I've sent a bunch of pictures on snapchat to people. I hardly ever do that, because I can't stand to look at my acne scars, but crooked teeth, my weird smile, my lazy eye, all the imperfections. I'm not overweight, reddit. Sure, I don't have a six pack and I have a little skin. But I'm not overweight. I'm short and I have an ugly face. I can't change that.

So much for feeling good about myself.

42,Last night we were having a bonfire after gameday and a cat appeared in the driveway next door towards the end of the fire. None of us there had seen a cat next door and know our neighbors behind us didn't have one so at first I was worried my cat got out and was walking around. I sent my roommate inside to find my cat (which he did thankfully) and went to investigate the cat. I get up and walk over to it while it's under a neighbor's car and it darts off to a tree near the road (we live directly on a main highway here). I get worried about it being near the road and start calling to it but it continues towards the road. I hurry to the edge of the hill to see it walk into the road and get hit. It's laying there wagging it's tail and gets hit again and I see it stop moving. I immediately just break down and start bawling. I just wanted to help it and see if it had a collar and now it's dead and gone. I can't get the visual and sound of it being hit out of my head. I cried for 3 hours to my girlfriend who was there. I feel like I just caused the death of this cat and it's killing me.,22Oct2017,4
43,"So I posted about this a while back but never got any responses ...and more recently just noticing an overall trend.  So the other day my friends pointed out that I seem to be really drawn to asian women.  Now I'm not one of those guys who fetishises asian women or anything, I just seem to be attracted to them more often than not.  Now in general I prefer to spend time with women more than guys.  Everyone was joshing me saying I have yellow-fever.

Last semester I had gotten to know these two girls who happen to be asian, but who were particularly shy, in our class.  I often feel the need to reach out to shy people because when I was like that, no-one every did.  I will admit I'm generally more biased towards women, I don't know why?  

One girl was really quiet and never really talked to any of us, but she seemed nice so I just started talking to her.  Nothing came of it because she was really too shy, and I couldn't get her to say much, even though she would try to talk to me.  The other girl I was paired with in a group project, even though she was just auditing the class, she was the only one of the three other people in the group who wanted to work with me.  I was just nice to her because I thought she was a nice person, tried to get to know her a bit.  Now I'm not used to getting attention from women, she started texting me over the next couple days to thank me for things, texting me good morning.  I probably should've asked her out but I've been so skittish lately I didn't think I should.  i just keep telling myself I can hardly keep everything else afloat right now, how could I ever manage to date right now?

TL;DR: A number of things...I want to date but don't really have the time for anything, I keep thinking too far ahead asking myself what might happen and where ""this”might go and it always stops me in my tracks.   I'll admit I'm attracted to asian women more than average, and more often than not that's who I end up with, even though sex has been a rarity lately.

46,"First of all, this might not be the right sub. I did my best to find the best one. Please let me know if somewhere else is better. 

I think I lack empathy for some things that generally people do have empathy for. This can cause me to get into fights with family members and makes it difficult to make new friends. 

I have a lot of empathy for animals and for my immediate family, but not so much for my extended family, friends, and people I don’t know. When they go through things or have problems, I think I can feign empathy because I feel more upset about how their problems negatively affect me, not that I’m upset they’re going through it. I’ve gotten better at pretending to be empathetic as the result of hanging around my boyfriend’s highly dramatic family and not wanting to step on any toes. 

There’s also some topics where people tend to feel a lot of empathy for which I don’t: children, rape, miscarriage, etc. I just can seem to understand why people get upset about those things. I’ve tried hard. I’ve tried to imagine being in their situation but I still feel nothing. This doesn’t mean I don’t take appropriate stances on these issues — obviously I’m against rape and such. Although I’ve gotten better at presenting myself as empathetic to these things and these people, it can cause making friends hard when I don’t react appropriately. 

What can I do? Can you learn empathy?
