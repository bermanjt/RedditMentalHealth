My plane got delayed because of mechanical issues, so I got to Newark 5 minutes before my next flight left, and then I had to run around to find a service desk, and I won't be able to get a hotel since I'm 16. Stuck here for the night alone. Until 2 PM tomorrow. With a splitting headache. Goddamnit.

4,"Hi!

This is the beginning of my rant post, of things that I want to take out of my mind, and get a second point of view. I won't really order this in an understandable manner, as I will write to clear stuff out of my mind as I go. If this doesn't even go in this SR, please let me know, but I just want to write this down.
Throwaway because i'm to ashamed to post on my real acc.

I'm 19, about to go on 20, and i've been living on my own since i was 17. I finished a programming curse last year, and this year I went to work at this startup. Since I was living in the suburbs (couldn't pay rent on the city, I was working as a waiter at a restaurant), I had 2 hours at least of commute - for each travel. 4hs just WAISTED on commute every day, and you couldn't even read or study on the train and bus that I took every day - as it was packed. So I start there, and a month later I start attending a night college. I woke up every day @6am, and went to sleep @1am.... I slept at most 5hs per day. Say goodbye to any social interaction, study time outside w/e, or normal sleep patterns.

This went on for a couple of months... until last month, where I got kicked out of work. And as I was on first year of night college, the shit that I saw there was really easy for me - and I considered it not even usefull. After getting kicked out, it felt like a kick in the balls. I moved to the city the week before getting kicked out to minimize travel time, thus getting better sleep. They didn't give a flying fuck, but it's not their fault. The boss had a thing for time, and if you got 10 minutes later than the time that you had to enter, ggwp, that's a late entry. So... mix that with a 2hs commute that changes every single day (one day it might take 1h 30m, and another day  2h 15m)... even If I got out of my house at the same time every single day, one day i'd be  30 minutes early, and the other day 15 minutes late. So, time passed by, and by the time I reached my 5th late entry, he fed up and kicked me out. I mean, I was warned, and told him that I was going to move, and that I was looking for places downtown to be closer to work... well.... fuck me. Moved to a more expensive place for absolutely nothing.

So, queue actual fuckup:

(Or rather, the moment where i'm right now.)


3 weeks have gone by. I only went out of my apartment to buy groceries. I still wake up early, shower, and take basic care of myself.... but nothing else. I've been sitting around all day playing video games, watching netflix, and masturbating. I've had more than 10 e-mails from companies that *actually* want my service, calling me for an interview. I know that I could get a job for next week if I even cared.

I have 1.2k whatsapp messages. I haven't picked up my phone to any of the calls I've received. My family wants to know what the fuck is going on. My grandmother rang my bell the other day and I didn't even bother to answer. I'm too ashamed to show what a complete utter fuck-up I am. I couldn't keep even a fucking entry level programming job at almost minimum wage on a fucking startup. And I think I won't approve college just because I haven't attended enough classes.


What the fuck has happened to my life. I used to have the **only** 100% covered scholarship on one of the best (read: most expensive) high school in my country. I was the only one on the history of the school that got both Academics *and* Sports leaderships. My (ex) HS gf was a model. I traveled abroad for the math Olympics, representing my country (argentina). My swimming times are *still* the record times at my hs. And all this while bearing with my shitty diagnosed ADD, without ever taking medication.


I'm lost. i've done nothing usefull out of my life in the past 3 years, and it is a trend. No, I won't kill myself, I'm not stupid enough. But I had such a great future, and I'm letting everybody that ever knew me down, including my family.

I need help.

50 more yards!
All right, let's go! Pick it up!
Let's go!
Yes, sir!
You're running out of time, Bryant!
Make it all the way around the track! Come on!
You want to be troopers? You better move it!
All right, next, get up here!
Let's hit it now.
Dean, come on!
All right. You've all completed the written exam.
However, you must now pass the obstacle course
to be admitted into the training program.
And remember, survive this,
and you're on the front lines of keeping New Jersey safe.
Yeah.
Sorry about the test, Dad.
We all have our crosses to bear, sweetheart.
Mine is named hypoglycemia.
Well, that's why you always have to have sugar nearby.
Are you gonna have pie?
Not tonight, Ma.
I'm just kidding. Yeah, I'm gonna want some pie.
You...
No, I meant now, Ma. Get the pie now.
Okay.
You said it,
and I just kind of got that stuck in my head now,
and can't really get it out. Pie. Here we go.
It really helps heal.
And, you know, not always, but sometimes,
you gotta do like the kids say, and just say, ""Whatever.""
Kids don't talk like that.
Some do, sweetheart. The older ones, okay?
I hear them in the mall. You know?
Peanut butter.
It just fills the cracks of the heart.
Go away, pain.
What?
Paulie.
Oh, no. Come on, Ma.
I'm not ready for this right now.
Dad.
Please.
We just don't want to see you go through another holiday alone.
But I'm not alone.
I've got you two. You know?
And besides, Black Friday's coming,
so my dance card's gonna be pretty full.
What? It's the busiest shopping day of the year.
Yeah, I should have known better than to try to explain it to civilians.
I wish I had a coworker here, like, ""Tyler, hey. You know, Black Friday's coming.""
""Gee, Paul, you don't have to tell me Black Friday's coming.
""Why do you think I've been walking around here
""with the eyes of an eagle?""
We prepare.
Dad, what does all that have to do
with being happy for the rest of your life?
You said, and I quote, ""If I don't have a girlfriend by November,
""I'll let you sign me up for perfectmatch.com.""
That was last year.
Okay.
Here we are.
Okay.
""What are you looking for in a woman?""
Well, your mother certainly had something special.
Yeah, illegal immigrant status.
She married you, got citizenship, and then she left us.
That's not entirely true.
We did have some good times back when she was still trying to trick me.
Well, I hate her.
Well, you shouldn't.
She gave me you.
I am pretty great.
You are. You are.
Okay, next question. ""Tell us about yourself.""
Let's see.
I know a lot about sharks.
Let me stop you right there.
Well-built and a great hugger.
Awesome, Grandma.
Not as awesome as this.
What are you doing?
Beefing up your profile with that nifty video that you made a few years back.
Ma, no.
I don't know. Don't you think it's a little too, ""Hey, look at me""?
Well, that is exactly what we want.
Eyes on the prize.
And don't worry, I will edit out the sweaty parts.
Dear God!
Hey! Back away from the vehicle.
Oh, dear God. Please.
Chompers, get down!
Hey, you know where a men's room is?
I do. You're gonna want to go to Lord and Taylor.
They got 12 stalls and heated seats.
Okay, keep the balls in the pit, kids. Kids!
Okay, my lip is numb.
All righty.
There you go.
Thank you.
Hey.
Yeah, I know.
That's not supposed to be here. It's a minivan.
... he can't handle it. The puck travels to the far board...
He keeps the play alive.
Paul!
Hey.
What is this?
That's my report on how to ease traffic flow from Macy's
down through the specialty shops.
How's that working out for you?
Actually, it's for all of us.
You see, if we could reroute the customers away from the food court,
it's gonna help the kiosks and cut down on shopper frustration.
It's your classic two-bird, one-stone scenario.
Can I ask you something?
Anything.
Why can't you just punch in, shut up and punch out like the rest of us?
Safety never takes a holiday.
Did your mom crochet that on a pillow?
Blart.
This is Sims. He's a new trainee. Let him trail you today.
Hey. Paul Blart. Ten-year veteran.
Wow. Veck Sims.
Well, Veck Sims, welcome to the show. Let's mount up.
Oh, yeah. That's the good stuff.
That's it. Treat her gentle, son.
Slap it, honor it.
So what made you want to pursue security?
I never finished high school. This is all I could get.
Yeah, I'm currently working on becoming a state trooper, myself.
Right now, I'm goose egg for eight. Hypoglycemia.
Confusing, right? Cut yourself some slack.
My first week riding on the job, I got lost behind the Sears.
They found me later in the fetal position, sporting a full beard.
I'm kidding. I can't grow a beard.
My uncle can. Stay snug.
Now, in the event that you approach an assailant,
here's what I want you to do. You're gonna pull up,
left hip forward, placing your right hand on your away hip thusly,
giving the illusion that you have a gun. Which, of course, we both know
you don't.
Okay? But you know what we do have?
Our voices! We have our voices.
If you remember one thing from today, it's this.
The mind is the only weapon that doesn't need a holster.
Right. Awesome. How long do we get for lunch?
Half hour. But I eat in 20, which leaves me five minutes for social time,
five minutes to get refocused.
We got a high roller.
Sir, I'm gonna need you to pull to the right.
Please pull to the side, sir. Out of traffic.
Tan jacket, red scooter, please pull to the right, out of traffic.
Sir.
Thank you.
Driving kind of recklessly back there, sir.
You're kidding.
I don't joke about shopper safety.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to issue you a citation.
Gonna need your first and last. Last first.
Sir. Sir. Sir, sir, sir.
Please don't make this more difficult than it needs to be, okay?
Are you able to... Sir. Sir! Sir. I am warning you, sir.
You're pushing it.
Sir. Sir. I am warning... Sir.
Sir. Sir. Sir.
Okay.
This is adding up, sir. He'll be back. He'll be back. He'll be back.
Hey.
Hi. Do you need something?
Yes. I'd like to welcome you to our mall.
Well, thank you.
Is there something else?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Just looking for some hair extensions.
Need a little more volume up top. Do you do men?
Do you do men hair? Do you do men hair? On the men?
Are you the guy that crashed into the minivan?
I don't think so. Which one?
Well, that one. That one right there.
Yeah. That one, yes. That... You know, that one was me.
Oh, wow. Are you okay?
Oh, yeah. Never better.
Although they're docking the paycheck pretty good.
Yeah.
You know what you should do? You should get the security tape,
and then, like, sell it to one of those shows, you know, where people crash into stuff.
Hello, early retirement.
Yeah, right?
Volume. Right, let me just see what I've got.
Yeah, this is Blart. If you need me, I'm over by the kiosks.
Who is this?
It's Officer Blart, reporting from Sector 5.
What the hell are you bothering me for?
Just a Code B check.
What a moron.
You know, I'll check in with them later. It's pretty intense.
Oh, right, yeah. Life of a security guard.
What, what?
No, it's just that you said security guard,
and it's perfectly acceptable...
I'm so sorry if I called you the wrong thing.
No, no, no, no. You did fine, you know?
It's just that there's a huge, huge controversy
brewing in the industry right now,
whether the title should be Security Guard or Officer.
I'm sure you heard about it.
I didn't.
You will. You're gonna.
But I'm sure I will.
It's out there.
So, you all set for the busiest shopping day of the year?
Yeah, right. And the worst day for a birthday.
This year, it falls on a Black Friday, which means I probably won't even get a card.
Everyone's too busy shopping.
You know what? Yeah. Autumn Ash.
Yeah.
I think that's your color.
I think this'll work.
It's a winner.
So that's $9.95.
$9.95?
Yeah.
Wow.
At those prices, now you got me thinking ponytail.
All right. Thank you.
Thank you.
Right. So there you go.
Okay.
And, there you go.
Thank you, Amy.
Thank you, Officer Blart.
Hey, Blart. Wow, nice shirt.
You went with a medium?
It's a bit formfitting,
but that's 'cause we're required to wear protective vests under our...
No. Not buying it. No.
'Cause I don't see any vest underneath here, so...
No, but it's a thick T-shirt. Basically like a thermal they have you wear.
Nope. Nope. No.
I don't understand why you're laughing. I just called you fat.
I'm not laughing.
Yeah, whatever. Amy.
Hey, everyone's going to American Joe's tonight, and I want to see you there.
Okay? We're gonna split some onion strings.
Wow. Wow.
Good.
Good hang.
Wow, yeah. That's great.
Hey, Blart, they need you at Victoria's Secret.
Okay, roger that.
Okay, I gotta go.
Okay. Bye.
I found it first.
No, you didn't.
Ladies. Problem.
What's the genesis?
She's trying to take the last push-up bra in this size.
There's gonna be a new shipment tomorrow. They'll be here by noon.
Well, I need this one now. I have a date tonight.
Really? Is he blind?
Whoa! Waterproof shoes and Baggies on the socks.
Not my first rodeo.
Okay, ladies, need to see some ID.
No, you don't.
Ma'am, I should warn you, I do have the authority to make a citizen's arrest.
So does anyone. I could arrest you right now.
That's true. She could.
Hey, not talking to you. Okay?
Can I see you for a second, please, ma'am?
Look, I understand your sensitivity.
I've had some issues with weight myself.
Are you calling me fat?
No. No, no, no, no.
I'm just saying I've been down that road.
I mean... I mean, I'm still on it. We both are, you know? Stranded.
Let's face it, we eat to fill a void, right?
But as soon as I started eating healthier,
I noticed I wasn't so moody.
And PS, your skin's gonna clear up.
Can you hold onto these?
Sure.
Ma'am.
You...
She's got tremendous upper body strength.
Backup! Backup!
She's biting my neck. She's biting my neck.
Backup!
Backup! Backup!
Look, I know you're new here and all,
but ""backup"" seems like a pretty universal term.
Hey. Can I give you a lift?
What, on that?
With an inexperienced driver I would recommend no,
but with me, you'll be as safe as the President.
I don't know. Couldn't that get you fired?
Yes, it could.
Okay.
Is this all right?
Absolutely.
And here you go. Safe and sound.
'65 Mustang.
Yeah.
Fun fact for you, a lot of people think the Mustang was named after the horse.
It was actually named after the P-51 Mustang.
That's a plane.
I didn't know that.
Well, thank you for the ride, Paul. That was so much fun.
No problem.
Listen,
if you ever, you know, need rides anywhere,
Dispatch, they can get me. You know.
Or we could just text each other.
Yeah.
Yeah, give me your cell phone.
My cell?
Yeah, and I'll punch my number in.
Left it in the casuals. You know what?
Just give me your number and I'll remember it.
Okay. Ready?
Yep.
All right. 555...
Not yet. Just...
Now I'm ready.
555...

...01... ...01...
...78. - Eight. Got it.
That's it. It's locked.
Great, so I'll see you tonight at American Joe's, right?
Yeah, I mean, everybody's going, so...
Yeah. ...why not me, too? I'll be...
Yeah, I'm there.
Great. Bye.
Okay. Bye.
Hey.
Hey! Hey. Glad you made it, Paul.
Good to be here.
Fun fact for you...
This place sucks.
You want to get out of here?
No.
I'm sorry, what were you saying?
No, I was just saying that
the first American Joe's actually opened its doors in 1972.
And most people, because of its service and theme,
think that it's derivative of Abe and Louie's, but it's not.
It's its own thing.
You really know a lot of facts, Paul.
Hey, Blart, I heard you got your ass handed to you by a fat chick at Victoria's Secret.
Well, I don't hit women,
so I don't even know what...
Yeah. Just minivans, right?
Hey, why don't you go over to the bar and grab yourself one of those girly drinks?
I'll meet you over there.
Okay. Does anybody else want a drink?
'Cause Stuart's buying.
No, no, no. They're good. They're good.
So... They're good.
Okay.
Hey, listen, I... We're basically already together, so...
I wasn't... I didn't even realize that.
And I was... I wouldn't... Doing anything.
Yeah.
I just want you to grab a hold of it, tight.
Okay?
I got it.
I mean, it's not like you really had a chance, okay?
Security guard? Really.
But you're a pen salesman, dude.
Yeah, and I just bought a Camry, so you can eat me.
All right, bro. Back off. You know, we're all just here having fun.
Okay, bro.
What?
Hey, thanks for getting my back there, brother.
Security blood runs deep between... Yeah, let's just go.
Round six.
Let's do this thing.
Gentlemen ready?
No.
Not yet. Now I'm ready. Okay.
And, go!
Leon, I can't give you the Heimlich, so you better chew.
I know.
Told you, boy. You better hurry up.
There you go. Nachos in my face.
Oh, my God. These peppers. The peppers are hot.
Oh, my God. Oh, that's a hot pepper.
Nachos are good, man.
Better inform all your friends, boy. Nachos about to be gone.
You're lagging behind.
Come on, Paul. Playing games.
I love these nachos, I'll tell you that much.
That lemonade is insane.
Yeah, Paul.
That's because it's a margarita.
No. I don't drink.
Twist it.
Feel the nub.
Hey, you want some? Here.
Yeah.
You want fruit?
Bye! You blinked! You blinked.
Time to pluck the grape from the vine.
Still got the Baggies! Hot jiggity.
Coming on the left.
False alarm.
Told my mom everything about us.
What are you talking about?
You're acting coy. Come on. It's natural.
You know. You so know.
No, I'm sorry, Paul. I don't know.
Snap. Pop goes the weasel.
So happy!
Yeah!
Yeah!
I believe in magic!
No way!
I'm sorry it didn't work out, dear.
It's fine, Ma.
Hey, Dad, why don't we check for matches?
Yes.
Yeah, I don't think so, sweetheart. I think I'm just gonna turn in.
Well, how about something special for lunch tomorrow to cheer you up?
I don't think so, Ma. It's fine.
If something's gonna work, it would be the sloppy joe.
But that would probably... You know.
You know, if you're doing the sloppy joe, do the sweet potato fries.
But it... W
Oh, no. Come on, Ma.

So, you all set for the busiest shopping day of the year?
Yeah, right. And the worst day for a birthday.
This year, it falls on a Black Friday, which means I probably won't even get a card.
Everyone's too busy shopping.

Yeah.
I think that's your color.
I think this'll work.
It's a winner.
So that's $9.95.

Yeah.
Wow.
At those prices, now you got me thinking ponytail.

Okay.

9,"**Some backstory:** A few weeks ago my first kiss/relationship/whatever started ignoring me after I slept with him, then ~10 days later he broke up with me. That was (and still is) tough, but a few weeks ago I decided to get Tinder with a lot of encouragement from friends (I jokingly said how much I like going on dates...).

Tinder was interesting, and I just did it to chat to random people if anything. If we got on, then cool, but I didn't expect anything.

**Main story (meeting Seb):** The fact that I didn't expect anything is why I feel so emotionally conflicted right now. Basically, the other day I got a match with Seb (name changed). Usually I just ignore Tinder matches, but this was after a stressful day of revision and I just wanted to straight-up talk to someone. Turns out as I was typing, he messaged me first - which was an unusually pleasant surprise.

Cue several of the most engaging conversations I've ever had with a stranger. We both took each other's blunt personas well and we had similar views on life. Then in came the flirty stuff like ""you're so attractive/cute/hot throwaway766916"", ""you don't say the same menial shit like others do throwaway766916"" and ""Why are you so perfect throwaway 766916?"". I believed it. Seb was blunt, debonair, smart and had aspirations. My type of guy. We added each other on Facebook and after a nervous half-hour it seemed we both liked what we saw - no red flags.

Seb had one insecurity which he told me about - he was a closeted bisexual. He was nervous that I'd care, but I didn't at all. However, I feel stupid for not considering this last night.

**Last night:** Last [Thursday] night we were chatting as usual, but then Seb made our conversation raunchy. I was down for that, so we both ended up pleasuring ourselves whilst chatting over Messenger. Turns out Seb is a kinky fuck and seemingly enjoyed the feeling of having possession over me. I wasn't really phased by it - different people have different fantasies and I enjoy going along with them. Besides, it was quite romantic. We finished, he said some nice shit and also said ""I'll be away from Friday evening to Tuesday afternoon - don't masturbate until Tuesday to prove your loyalty to me. Talk tomorrow ;)"". I agreed and would happily wait until Tuesday.

**Today:** He didn't send me a message, or read mine. I saw early this morning he viewed my LinkedIn. He'd also seemed to make most of his photos private. Late this evening I checked again, because it felt off. Couldn't find him. Checked Messenger, he still had his name but he was ""unavailable"" to message - meaning he'd blocked me. Also unmatched me on Tinder.

**The aftermath:** So now I just feel pathetic. I get so attached to people so fast. I tell them how I've felt used in the past and that I don't expect anything long-term, but closure would be fucking nice. So many times I've been left out to rot by lying sacks of shit. I can't help it if I get attached to people quickly, can I? What do I do?

The worst thing is I only knew Seb for a few fucking days! What the fuck is wrong with me? Even right now part of me is thinking he just got spooked by a major bout of post-fap regret and he'll come back soon...

I suppose I'm also disappointed because I've been against the generalisation that when it comes to relationships, guys are easily freaked out and run away without saying anything. However, all my experiences support that claim. Now I'm scared I have trust issues.

**TLDR:** Tinder actually gave me a decent-seeming match - loljk he ghosted me after using me for dirty talk.

Fuck you Seb. I'm going to masturbate now, so fuck you.",15Apr2017,8
10,"Ok so I'm a senior in high school but am currently taking a psychology class at the local community college. We had to write a summary of a peer review journal which I did just fine. I cited all the sources used (2) one was for a single sentence in the first paragraph and the other for the rest since I had to summarize it. In my second paragraph I fully listed all of the people with full names from whose study I chose along with the year and institution researched, along with this I put the research study in my works cited page. At no point did I directly quote or use exact text from the study yet she gave me a 0 that dropped me from a overall 97 to a 73 claiming I had plagiarized the whole paper because I didn't use an in text citation. Please help I'm not sure how to go about this. Also no rough draft to submit and she said she wouldn't help us with it any when assigning it. Personally I feel like this is very harsh.",15Apr2017,1
13,"As of Monday my 1 yr old son, my 23 yr old husband &amp; I (21) will be homeless until we are able to move in to our place. It will be a week but that wait is killing me. We ran through some trouble and got kicked out of my parents- my dad &amp; hubs butt heads a lot. He ultimately kicked my husband out but we stick together as a family, so my son &amp; i joined him. We were able to stay with some family friends &amp; then jump to another family members house. Which we are SUPER grateful for! But we have like literally $100 to our name. My credit card is over limit, my phone bill company decided to charge me twice &amp; caused my bank account to go into the negatives. My savings is gone. The only other money we have is for rent. We thankfully have enough food for the month &amp; clean clothes. But just knowing that who we can ask for help is limited, and then again how do you even begin that conversation asking for help!
I just started work this week, I've been a SAHM. My husband is looking for work as well, but we only have one car right now. 
I hate myself more for not being financially prepared for something like this. I hate myself for putting my son in this situation. I don't know what to do or what to even try to do.  I have failed as a mother, who can't even provide a safe space &amp; roof over her sons head. 
I don't know what to do, I don't know where to go. I just feel so shitty for not being able to get out of this rut.",15Apr2017,2

I'm a woman and in my late 20s. I get along fine with all kinds of guys but when it comes to women there's always some kind of tension. I know a lot of it comes from when I was a kid I had female best friends and one time I was hurt and backstabbed pretty bad so that left a mark. I've also had great friendships too so I don't know how much this plays into it. Anyway, I think it would be way too long to talk about how I interact with other women.

23,"I thought it was well established that zodiac signs (and, by extension, horoscopes) were nonsense. I'm not talking about the stars themselves, I know they exist, but the idea that because you were born at a certain time then you act a certain way. Recently, though, friends and family members of mine who are otherwise intelligent, well reasoned, and logical, are talking about zodiac signs like they actually exist and I feel like I'm going crazy. They don't exist, right? Aren't they just another flimsy sense of identity for people to cling to and use as an excuse for their actions?

I don't understand why I even used these social media platforms.  I don't need to know that you have a ton of money to spend and I don't need to know where you've been in the last 24 hours.  


I should find these things out by talking and having REAL human communication.  I did it...I removed negativity from my life to benefit my own health.  Well I guess, time will tell if this demon will slowly creep back into my life or stay where it belongs.",15Apr2017,27
25,"I'm doing a lot of consciousness work lately, highering my consciousness awareness of life. It's been quite a ride i finally feel like my life has meaning once more but it quite loops and shows me how meaningless it is at times. But atleast it's much more accurate than it used to be. But that is what i'm slightly afraid of as that's been my whole life thinking i know when i didn't. But it does prove a lot more deeper. So far i've finished a few books of conciousness work, I still have much more on queue will finish them and go for my 5month retreat of pure meditations. It feels like i'm about to be a prophet at times. Loving life unconditionally I kind of get it now when your clear it does feel like it even when you know nothing is true from all the labeling surprisingly the love emotions of just being present exists it's quite blissful to be free after being a slave for so long.

Sometimes I notice a girl will go out of her way to talk to me, but I'm scared it might just be her being friendly or leading me on to nothing. If I ask her out and she says 'no' then what will happens to our friendship. Please someone enlighten me.

I'm not sure why this triggered it but I was laying in bed with my girlfriend and we were being dumb and she started tickling me. It went from 0-100 just like that. I didnt immediately freak out but my heart rate immediately jumped and the intrusive thoughts started and they haven't stopped. This will be the third day straight. My heart's constantly pounding, every little thing sets me off and the intrusive thoughts won't go away. I broke down crying in my girlfriend's arms yesterday. I haven't cried in almost 4 years. I don't know what's going on and it's starting to scare me. I thought I had my anxiety managed and now it feels like it's never going to stop. I just want to die so it'll all stop.

56,"Mostly for my mother. She deserves better and I wish I was better at showing any affection towards her or anyone else in my family. I feel like a robot with a short temper, my mouth fires things before I can think, usually the things I say come from a place of hurt. I wasn't raised by my mum, I was raised by my grandma (dads mother) and she kinda just kicked me to the curb at 13 and then acted like she never knew me and now she hates me.. But pretends like she likes me. I hate my grandma, for pretending like she cares when she doesn't. My mum knows this, my mum knows how twisted my grandma is because my grandma can't stand my mum. My dad loves his mum and now his issues are with me and my mum. 

Today I realised that my grandma is the reason why I don't like my mum. I get paranoid my mum doesn't care, she's only doing it for show.. But she's got no one to show. I know she loves me, she cried when she thought I was dying. I love her so much but she still makes me angry for no reason. 

It's me vs mum vs dad&amp;grandma. And my mum has been alone through it all as much as I have, I do have younger siblings but I've become so disconnected to my family. I love them so much but I know I can't show it. I want to be there emotionally for my siblings and mum but I can't emotionally connect with anyone, I never have on a real basis, I just know what to say, what people want to hear. 

I wish I could be a nicer person but it never lasts for long because I get busy, I lose my temper, I'm tired. 
I try in small ways.. I try the way my dad USED to try, by always asking if anything needs to be bought, if anyone needs anything.. Basically just stuff money can sort in a second. I used to have a problem with him always bribing us with money and never actually being there when I was younger. Now he just doesn't do shit, I don't care though. I just want to be nicer.
