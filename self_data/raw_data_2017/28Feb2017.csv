2,"Our scumbag former landlords sold the property out from under us last week, without a word to anyone in our apartment complex. The following day, everyone in the complex got a notice to vacate by the end of April from the new owner.

Our big win is that we managed to negotiate with the new owner that nobody would pay rent for the remaining two months, and that nobody would get UDs filed on them!

This is such a relief, and I am proud of what we accomplished acting as a community.",28Feb2017,3
4,"I'm a young person (just out of high school) looking for an alternative path to college. I have access to funds (my parents say they are willing to help pay for things as long as they are good for my well being) but I am having trouble finding something that sounds like a good fit for me.

Things I'm interested in include science, mathematics, music (theory), language, programming (mostly as a hobby so far), hiking, nature, and gaming (board and video).

I am also very open to new ideas and don't mind hearing ones that oppose my own.

If you know of any programs I could attend or have any ideas for adventures I could go on, please post them even if you don't think they are applicable to me. The more options the better

10,"Brushing your teeth while pooping, while at first seemingly a wonderful, time-saving idea, is not

Imagine this situation

It's all going swimmingly and you're finishing up your brushing when the poop starts coming out

You want to get up to spit in the sink but there is stuff coming out your butthole and you need to remain firmly planted in this spot

Your mouth is slowly dying from agony as the minty taste stings you

You prematurely cut off your dump even though you could release more, and finish your teeth business

But now when you plop back down on that seat you screwed up your progress with your sudden stop

Now you have to earn that poops trust before it starts coming back out

Now you just spent more time than if you had just done them seperately

12,"Has anyone else noticed how pointless debating is when it comes to persuasion or dealing with what is actually *right*?  

""War doesn't determine who's right, but who's left.""  We all know that one, but is it the same if you replace ""War"" with ""Debating""?  

I can tell you now that I'm not a persuasive person.  I could have all of the information correct about a subject and still find a way to leave the ""debate"" or ""argument"" (though people who enjoy arguing don't like to call it arguing) feeling like I lost or that I still missed something.  

Having the facts or not, someone can always win an argument so long as they can think of ways to shut you down or pick out a minor flaw and exploit it to no end.  It's all about your stamina, it seems.

I'm tired of being right about somethings and still having it blow up in my face because someone who dares to be ruder or louder than me will eventually just wear me down.

36,"After talking with my friend about a recent date, I realized I am reaaalllly attracted to people with fucked up pasts. I don't know if this is fucked up of me, or like a protector thing, or what.

I know a ton of women in my life that have had really hard childhoods. Most of my closest female friends have had shitty abusive fathers or even been sexually abused. For the record, not saying that they were hurt turns me on. Hopefully what I'm trying to describe becomes more clear. But understanding this shitty dark thing in their life helps me feel really close to them, like they shared the worst part of themselves with me. 

If I am really honest, that probably validates me which is of course a turn on. But more than being shared with, I think I like to feel like some protector. Like her father was a monster, and she cried and hated her life and was ""emo"" in high school and couldn't relate to people and was kind of an outcast. She might not be exactly like that now, and she doesn't even have to be broken anymore (as in moved on), but that feeling of residual sadness that I can somehow fix and make better is so goddamn attractive to me.
At the point of rambling, I feel it adds some crazy intimacy. This ""us against the world"" feeling where I can make things better. 

Some examples:
First serious love: fucked up, depressed past. Eventually had to go to therapy.

Second serious love: shitty real father, divorce from step father who was good to her. Home schooled so exiled a bit, always moved around. Still has PTSD. This was my most recent ex (we only broke up cause we moved far away unfortunately). 

Tinder date from this week (this is how I realized I am attracted to this): artsy girl who used to be a punk and skip class and run away from home to get away from her verbally abusive and manipulative step father. When we were hanging out and she told me this, I felt like a crazy surge of attraction to her. To summarize, I feel like I need to clarify that I hate that these things happened to them. But thats a part of it! Like I like being this intimate person that makes it all better. But its the darkness that makes the good so much better, ya know?

Let me know what you think: I could actually be a shitty person. Will this fuck up me in the future?

tl;dr: really attracted to messed up people (or at least messed up pasts). Will this end poorly for me?",28Feb2017,21

Why am I feeling so stingy? 

This is the opposite of how poor people supposedly deal with a windfall. I just want to see the cash stay there so badly... yet I have bills I need to catch up on. It was a struggle to click ""Pay bill now"" even though I rationally know that I'm better off for doing so. I'm still working and have money coming in.

39,"I have been unemployed for two years (to date, actually). I have been applying to all kinds of jobs from grocery stores to retail to communications to marketing... And nothing. A few interviews, sure but then nothing afterward.

I live in a city where a lot of people are unemployed so there are dozens and dozens of applicants to every single role. Furthermore, our town has university and I am sure that those studying in a university or those who graduated (I am neither) have better chances than me when applying.

I am poor and have very little I can do for a hobby. I go to the gym, which helps with my anxiety and depression but other than that, I really can't afford anything.

I have no family and very few friends who live elsewhere. I cannot even remember the last time I hugged someone. I crave for belonging, I crave for human touch, of love. I crave to feel like I matter. I wake up every day and wonder why I bother when it does not matter to anyone if I do or do not. Every once in a while I am contemplating suicide when the loneliness, emptiness, and depression eat my brains.

Because I have no family or friends, I have nothing that keeps me here... BUT the lack of safety net also keeps me from taking risks. I feel very, very hesitant to apply for jobs outside my town because moving to a new place where I have no one to support me if I fail is terrifying. I know I could do it but wanting to do it, wanting to risk everything (and I mean everything because it is very little that I even have), feels like too much.

At the same time, I know this can't go on. I can't go on like this. I am under 30 years old, poor, not going anywhere in my career or my life. I have no future. I have nowhere to go. I have no one to talk to.

45,"Before I discovered actual masturbation, I learned to associate a high-risk situation with sexual pleasure. I think I must have been around 8 or 9 years old at the time when this took place. 

I grew up playing Super Mario World on the Super Nintendo. In that game, there's a time limit for every level. Failure to complete the level in the time limit results in Mario losing a life and having to restart the level.  I remember just having Mario sit in one spot waiting for the timer to tick down. When there's under one hundred seconds remaining, it plays a little tune to indicate panic, and the regular music for the level would speed up and play faster. 

By this time, I'd be there sort of rubbing the controller on the cloth of my pants above my penis and trying to finish the levels before Mario died (also hoping my mom didn't catch me; the console was in a high-traffic area of the house). I can still remember my heart pounding in my chest so loud I could hear it inside my head and the surge of the adrenaline I could feel in my veins like electricity. Droplets of sweat appeared on my forehead. My eyes were rolling toward the back of my head and I would get tunnel vision as I fought to keep them focused on the screen. It was overwhelming. The more I let the clock run down and the less time remaining to complete the level, the greater the pleasure. The panic and pressure were essential to the pleasure I received. I was risking it all for a few moments of brief euphoria. 

I can still remember that rush to this day, and I've never been able to achieve it again.",28Feb2017,14

65,"Hi, there. I'm a 22 guy from Argentina and this is my first time posting here, even though I've been lurking for a while. I'm just looking with a bit of advice regarding me and my friend.


I've known this friend for about 4 years now. We were part of the same forum that we visited a lot, and after that when it went down I contacted them on facebook and tumblr and we kept in contact, becoming good friends. We're pretty alike and I realized that lately I've been... kind of in love with them? I have a hard time distinguishing between platonic and romantic feelings but I feel very strongly about them.


We live only 4 hours apart and we've met once with other friends from that forum. And we pretty much talk a bit every day. Lately, we've been more... open about each other with our talks, helping each other with insecurities and stuff. And lately I feel that... maybe, they're flirting with me? Maybe?


The other day they told me about how much problem they have recognizing the difference between platonic and romantic feelings (like me) and told me they felt very strongly either way about all their close friends. And after that talk (which they told me they were happy to have with me) they've been saying more than usual that they would like for me to visit them when I can, and making plans to get drunk together and listen to sad music. They even told me yesterday they bought a cute thing for me that they expected to give me when I went there.


And just.... I'm confused because of all these things, but despite that we're kind of... shy? Towards each other, or at least I am. I have a hard time telling them they're really cute or beautiful because I'm afraid they might take it the wrong way, and the same thing happens the other way around (altough to me I feel like they only very ocassionally say that because I'm not very good looking and they don't want to lie)


So... I really don't know. I would like to go for it but the possibility of... me being wrong scares me because I don't want to make things awkwards. I'm just really bad at reading people.
Any advice? I would really appreciate it.
