0,"I've been through a lot in this last year. Surgeries, recoveries, depression anxiety obesity weight loss and so many things that I can't write them all. 

I've always been the  good person. Like, seriously, that stupid person who would neglect herself to help others. That stupid person who stressed so much for people who didn't give a shit about me. 

I've been educated to help people. Even in my family, they all neglect themselves in order to help others. They got sick from all that stress and i was close to do the same. 

After my accident, nobody gave a shit about me (except parents and 1 more person). Literally i wasn't able to help anyone for a while, i didnt receive a single fucking call from my 'friends' --- the people i did everything for. Nothing. They didnt even care. It's like I didn't exist for 8 months. They needed things, they asked and they 'heard' i am sick, but they didn't bother to call at least. 

Anyway, I can't care less now. 

I am a bit worried but grateful about the fact that i don't gove a shit anymore. About anyone. I only care about myself. I became selfish as fuck. Even with family. I stopped trying to help or impress others   I stopped being afraid of what they think of me. 

I don't even care what others do. I became seriously all by myself. I love myself and I do things for myself. I llst weight, i have ambition now, i track everything i do and i do it for MYSELF. FOR the first time in my whole life, i switched. 

I feel jerkish. I have always hates self centered people and now i became one of them. I feel really good but i am afraid it may not be ok to be like this. A small part of me has questions but I feel so good that I can't even care. 

There is no day without pain. There's no day without restrictions for me. But i fight this alone. I can do this without asking for help and I will only help others only if it is convenient for me, if i have time and if it doesn't affect my priorities. I became what I used to hate. But I feel better than ever. I evolved. And for me, this is the first time ever when I feel love and respect for myself. ",30Jun2017,4

12,"So last Saturday my sister was murdered by her husband. (We're doing fine, by a broad definition of fine). And her daughter was made an orphan. 

So I can't really talk about this on my facebook because people on my facebook are the ones saying it. But there are a lot of unhelpful things people say. Including:

""He was such a sweet guy."" No. Sweet guys don't murder their wives and orphan their child.

""They were such a loving couple."" Apparently they weren't.

""You can't judge him. We don't know what he was thinking or if he was thinking at all."" Well he was thinking 'I'll murder this person.' That alone is enough for me to judge him. I'm judging him hard.

""He never hit her or anything. It's just so strange."" I wish he had hit her. I wish he'd broken her jaw because if he had- we would have gotten her out of there. She can't recover from being dead. I would have taken just about anything shy of dead. 

""So. What really happened/Anything requesting the gorey deets"" Really people. Just no. Only trashy people do that. Especially considering my family has shared all the details. Like- all of them. We're not being shy about this.

So how can you avoid these faux pas? Stick to generic statements if you have no clue what to say. Don't just muse aloud. Seriously. Most of these are like- idle comments except the picking around for details. After a death is the perfect time to listen to someone, get quiet for a minute or two, and then speak. Just stop and wait a minute. 

There needs to be a pamphlet of ""Things not to say for all occasions"" when you graduate highschool. ",30Jun2017,4

17,"I’m divorced. I was married for 11 years and at the end she started believing I was cheating on her. She was encouraged by her friends, and nothing I could do would convince her. **I WAS NOT CHEATING ON HER**. 
We had a 100 year old house (hardwood floors) with a huge back yard. Fruit trees, hot tub, garden. 
After our first son (we had two) was born she decided to take time off from work. She decided part time would be good for her (24 hours a week). My parents lived one block away, and wanted to help us with child care. Her mom lived 1 mile away, and also volunteered help. Nope. She wanted to work part time. She wanted to go to school and I was supportive. I believed she could go first, and I would go second. I took a class here and there, she slowly continued in her pre-requisites. 

The time came for her to start the program and she couldn’t do it. She was petrified.  She *”would not do it”*. 

Ok. Ok. It’s going to be ok. I’ll go full time. I’ll work my ass off. I just need you to pick up a full time schedule to make up the difference. When I finish up, you can find something that you want, at your pace. 
*It’s for our family!*

No. She refused to work full time. What was I supposed to do? Force her?! It became another one of many ongoing conflicts. 

A year later I was served with divorce papers. 
Her mom bought an expensive lawyer. 


**ALL MEN DECIDING TO GET MARRIED...** 

**Do you know what happens when you let your wife work part time?**  Or if they **Stop** working at all so that they can be a “stay at home mom”?  When they divorce you, the care, feeding, clothing, etc of your children triples in cost. Your wife *deserves* alimony because she was **forced** to quit her job (or cut back her hours) to take care of your children while you were working. You want equal custody? How much do you know about raising kids since you’ve been working full time and had limited experience with the raising of children? 

I got the house. 
My parents moved in to help me keep it. I sold everything worth value to keep the payments up on the house. 
I became agoraphobic. Literally could not leave my room. *Even* to see my children. They were 5 and 3 at the time. I completely missed out on a huge part of their lives. I can already see how this has affected them. 

My children still visited every 3 days. I still visited them and picked them up from school when I could. 
I attended plays and soccer games, track and field. All when they were in elementary school.

I met someone new. My ex-wife found out about this. 

I didn’t fill out a piece of paper saying that I was unemployed, (and disabled) and right before I was going to be hired to a new job I received a notice that 50% of my wages would be garnished for back child support. I asked the bill collector how I could maintain my current bills along with the mortgage on my house that my children stayed at when they were with me. (Btw I make under $45,000 a year). 
She told me that it was none of her concern. “How would you like to contact us when you get your job? If you don’t get your job, we will garnish your unemployment.” 

I checked the cities websites for programs to represent men going through what I was going through. I found nothing. Women and children? Um, yes. Yes yes yes. 
I called the city. They told me they would get back to me. Can you guess whether or not they got back to me? 

I’ve decided I’m a feminist because all of the programs, social media presence, and empowerment that women deserve. I’m **sure** it will help me (a man) and my two boys in the long run. I’ll be in a better position to give my children a better life because of making the lives of women better. Right? **Right?** It’s all of the men keeping me down. 

*edit* - thanks for the kind replies and suggestions. I definitely have some bitterness, but not an augmented reality when it comes to the facts that happened to me. 
I’ll check out the suggestions you’ve made and take all the encouragement from your PMs to heart. 

I also made this account to just be my spill it/vent it account. My life isn’t all doom and gloom these days. I just wanted an account to let it all out every now and then. Maybe show my bad side too! 

Thanks again. ",30Jun2017,11

20,"I've had a very lonely life as the eldest of a poor family, a lonely life in the foster system, and a lonely life in college (which I dropped out of.)

I've lived....


* in a car
* in a hospital
* in bad areas riddled with crime
* in homeless shelters
* in a new place every year or two in my 25 years of life


But now I've found a partner for life, I've renewed old relationships, and set boundaries in my bad relationships. I'm finally stable enough to live in a house and have a dog. As much as I don't want to move again, my husband does, and damn it I'll do anything for him! So I'm making one final move - with the love of my life! - in to one final, forever and ever home in a great, quiet city AND I'M SO EXCITED! We're not moving for another couple of years but I feel so fortunate to be in a position to actually CHOOSE where I want to live and cast roots in to the soil.

23,"With high possibility of marrying a Muslim girl, I have to respect her wish if she want to cover her aurat and head covering. 

But... I like short skirts, mini pants, v neck shirts and many more. 

Short skirts are the best because of reasons. Valid fapable reasons. 

So, my plan is to have a 'In the House clothing that she can wear only when we are alone in the house'. 

My previous ex is fine with that idea since she only wear a round neck with short pants in the house but wear the full cover the aurat clothing when going out. 

So, a secret closet full of only indoor clothes.

31,"I think the reason I have always been so unhappy professionally is that I don't just hate accounting, or working for a bank, but that I just am not passionate about anything.  If someone asks me what I would do if money were no matter, I can't think of anything.  I like to think I'm motivated: I show up to work on time every day.  I don't call in sick.  I go to the gym 3-4 days per week.  I keep my home as tidy as I can.  I teach my children to be orderly, but try to have fun and play and let them be wild sometimes.

But apparently, I'm not truly motivated because I don't have a passion for anything.  Lots of people just work and don't love what they do, but I detest walking in the place.  I dislike my co-workers, and it's generally 8 hours or torture working for a bank every day.  I don't laugh.  I don't have ""good moments.""  I wonder how people even discover their passion.",30Jun2017,5
32,"Hey guys, not really sure where this belongs or even if this is a problem or just me being selfish. So I'm 22, started working 6 months ago for a software dev company as an intern before I go back to university (Paid internship).

So I get my money paid directly into my bank every month and at first, I didn't even realise the problem. I think it's first important to mention how this is working, I'm living at home with my mom and sister and recently her boyfriend of 10-15 years walked out on her/us so money for her is pretty tight to come by. Personally, I don't spend a lot of money and am happy for her to take a cut of my money towards whatever she needs it for and that includes things like letting me stay, food etc. 

However since I've started earning, I've made 2 expensive purchases and a few video games here or there (Expensive purchases being a Nintendo switch console and recently a new PC monitor. Both cost around €400). When I went to buy the PC monitor, I found out there's no money in my account whatsoever, and fair enough she offered to pay for it since she spent it but at the same time I feel like I've worked for 6 months and haven't saved any money at all. I'd consider myself pretty good at saving, I don't drink or smoke or anything like that so really my expenses come down to a few video games and general stuff such as food etc.

Am I right in being a little bit pissed about this? I don't even know what I should say or do, should I start earning from some freelance work and build up my own collection of money that she has no access to (This really seems to me like something that I shouldn't have to do though). It sucks because we get on really well and I'm not sure what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  

EDIT: Probably a good idea to mention that the amount is somewhere close to €1200 per month",30Jun2017,1

35,"I'm a 30 year old female. I don't think I'm a prodigy, but I'd classify myself as above average intelligence. I feel like I'm constantly being held back from reaching my full potential though due to my excessive daydreaming. I know everyone daydreams, but the frequency of my daydreaming is something I don't think most people can understand and it's almost like I'm in a non-responsive trance state.  I'm not exaggerating how much they've interfered with my life, either. It's been going on my entire life and I don't know what to do about it anymore. When I was probably 5 or 6, my mom took me to a children's psychiatry clinic because she noticed I would zone out while playing and just stare off into space. Usually it would take her saying my name at least a few times before I would ""snap"" back to reality and respond. The doctors never ended up medicating me and I'm not real sure what they eventually concluded was wrong. I went through my entire adolescence making terrible grades. It wasn't because I didn't understand the material, but I was constantly missing homework assignments that I never knew were assigned in the first place and showing up only to find out there was a test that day I didn't know about. My assumption is that I was probably in one of my daydreaming trances when my teachers were giving out these assignments. My mom chalked it up to laziness and wouldn't let me see a doctor about taking a stimulant. When I turned 18, I decided to seek out medical help on my own. A psychiatrist started me on 10mg Adderall and over the years my prescription has increased to 60mg daily, which is the legal limit here in Texas. Everyone I know who has ever taken Adderall gawks when I tell them my prescribed dosage is 60mg and say they'd be high as a kite on that dosage. Honestly, it just makes me feel more ""normal"" and like I can sometimes finish a complete a thought without being interrupted inside my own head. So while Adderall definitely improved the situation 10 fold, the constant daydreaming still happens. It's recently cost me yet another job because my productivity is so low. What a normal person could get done in a 40 hour work week, would probably take me 70 hours. My house is constantly in a state of chaos because I get distracted as soon as I start a task, which leads to a lot of half finished projects. I can waste literally hours laying in bed alone with my thoughts. Sometimes I play out hypothetical situations and conversations in my head. Other times it's almost like I'm watching a movie because the daydreams are so vivid. One thing that I find myself doing often is ""reading"" a page from a book or a website, but not actually reading it. I'll spend a little while in my trance-like state and then when I snap back to full consciousness, I realize that I've just been staring at a page for several minutes literally reading nothing. It's only after I snap out of it, that I even realize what I was doing. It's not like I sit in front of my computer and make a conscious decision to stare at it and do nothing. Just during writing this post I think I've had about 3 zone-out episodes and I'm on a stimulant drug at this very moment. It's even worse without the Adderall. My shrink has tried 3 other anxiety medications on me and none of them seemed to make much of a difference. Most recently, I started seeing a talk therapist and I haven't noticed any improvement. I've never heard of anyone else that daydreams away their time to the level of extremity that I do. There have been times where I'll skip or postpone meals even if I'm starving, or taking a shower when I need one, because I'm ""busy"" daydreaming. I also have a tendency to pick at things excessively and zone out while I enjoy that activity. As an example, yesterday I was using a cuticle remover on my nails and zoned in becoming overly focused on this activity which is normal for me when I do repetitive tasks. After I finally turned my focus away from the nail picking, I only then realized that I had just spent almost 3 hours doing it. I know this is not normal behavior and that functioning adults don't neglect their priorities to obsess over something like removing cuticles. I desperately want to be able to get things done around the house, stick to a schedule, hold down a job, etc. etc. It's at the point now where I don't know what else to do and 30 years of this has been exhausting. I don't see how I will ever have a ""normal"" life if I can't find a way to fix this. The worst part is the feeling that it isn't fixable. Sometimes I feel like my brain was just wired wrong and there's no corrective surgery for that.",30Jun2017,3

* My (gf) looks absolutely stunning the other day - I wanted to say something about it but I didn't, just because I was embarrassed about it. So I just complimented her earring instead. What?

* I kept bothering her about useless questions, and sounded like I was ordering her around

* I started eating way before her and mostly just sat and watch while she ate hers

* I wanted to take a photo with her, but she was the one who asked me instead. Even so, even though I wanted to look closer in the photo (like pulling her closer), I didn't do shit

* There was photo booth-ish kinda thing and I (think) we agreed on taking a photo there. After I went to the toilet her and all my friends just disappeared. I later found where my friends were but not her - I found out later that she was actually taking a photo at the booth with her friends. By the time I found her, the booth was already closed.

* She hugged a lot of people and seemed to really enjoy doing so; I wanted to hug her as well but I was too busy being a wimp 

* There was a concert and she invited me to go dance with her, but I didn't even know the song and just wasn't in the mood at that time. I really don't think she was having fun with me like that. She later excused herself to walk around instead, but I knew it was because I was ruining the mood

* She didn't look happy at all when she was around me, she only looked happy when she was talking to her friends 

I was actually really jealous and a bit mad, but then I realized it was all my fault in the first place. I don't  see how she could stand being with me.
