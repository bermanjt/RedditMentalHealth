1,"Me and my girlfriend just recently broke up after being best friends for 3 years . We always stayed close after short break ups.  And we would ALWAYS realize the problem and be sad that we wasted the time away from eachother. But this time I really think I lost my best friend.

There was apparently more problems with us than what I thought was going on.  I'm not saying I'm in the right with anything, or that she is wrong for doing what she did. But after 8 months of living together. And always wanting to be with her over anything. We had a 5 year plan. And where both excited about the future. We told eachother everyday, not only I love you,(a million plus times) ""but you are my love, and your mine for ever so get used to it."" 

Communication about how we feel was never our strong suit. And things started going south as living with eachother in her grandmas basement progressed. I was in an out of work. Away from my family. And overly stressed. I have terrible depression and I'm bi polar 2 (as I've been told) but I don't fully buy in to that... but I started being a little distant I would say, and we were going through a hard time. So she asked if I could go home with my family for a little while to work on us, who lives in Ohio and I was in Utah at the time... so after being caught of guard. I questioned what was going on... we were still very much together mind you, when my family said that I could just go up to Montana and chill with my sister and brother in law. So I unknowingly go with what she told me to do. ""It will just be for a little. Don't worry!"" So I go.. and  A DUDE THROWS UP ON ME 30,000 FEET IN THE FUCKIN AIR ON A GOD DAMN PLANE. 

And then a week later she calls me and says we are done.


WHAT THE FUCK. I thought we were just spending time with family and strengthening us?!? 
IM SERIOUSLY ABOUT TO LOSE MY MIND. 
trust me. I made mistakes. I'm not hiding from that. But how am I supposed to go on from here? 
After talking to her a few times in the last 3 weeks now, she has been asked out but she's not ready for that... yet. And that it's none of my business if she does date. She says other stuff like, ""I need to work on my self"". 
everyone around me is just as confused as I'm.
She begged to be on my families group message a few months before all this, and I jokingly said, well this will be awkward if we ever break up. To which she says, THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. 

Well guess what. It's awkward and it sucks. 

She is my EVERYTHING. And I just wish that I could talk to her one more time. But... I'm in Montana now, for the foreseeable future. 

I'm sorry this is so long. I just needed to vent to literally anyone.... 

I'm confused, sad, and looking for some advice. 

Most of all I miss my love. And I hate my self for all the pain and sadness I caused her. I can't live with this shit. 

Do I just forget about her the way she's forgetting about me? 
 
Thanks. ",25Jan2017,1
2,"I am traveling for work.  Got back to my hotel room with some delicious roast beef and mashed potatoes.  As I walked into the room, I noticed the bed was made.  Cool, the maid must have cleaned the room while I was gone.  

I sit down for dinner, take a bite and the door slams open against the cheesy bar they put for security.  Immediately I thought this is how I die.  I am in NYC, from Kansas, and someone just tried to get in the door.  I jumped up to go to the door and as I got to the door, something felt wrong.  Felt very very wrong.  I tried to breath, no air.  I open the door for the maid who forgot her bag in the bathroom.  Try to take another breath, no air.  It just happened about an hour ago and I can remember it like slow motion.  Try to take my third breath, no air, panic begins to set in.  Its the craziest thing.  Your trying to swallow to clear your airway because that is what you do and your body says no, its not going down, push it back.  For a few seconds you get caught in this odd cycle of swallow and nope, the whole time not  breathing.

I am a 40 year old adult male.  I have seen and done some stupid shit in my life.  Fights.  Submarine Service.  Even had a gun pulled on me.  I am telling you, nothing compares to trying to breath and physically not being able to.   I looked at the maid and grabbed my throat while I frantically tried to breath.  Nothing.  I started to pound my back as hard as I could while the maid just stared at me like a deer in the headlights.  Then in one quick second, it happened.  I coughed and threw up at the same time.  Cleared my airway.  I could finally breath, but uh oh, this might be the big chest grabber.

I had a pain across my chest like I have never felt before.  Both arms went numb.  I collapsed to the floor on all fours throwing up, over joyed that I could breath, and worried I was having a heart attack.  The maid who could speak only broken english grabbed her bag and bolted while I was on the floor.  It took about 20 minutes for the adrenaline to wear off and my chest to stop hurting.  I feel fine now and I am sure I just pulled every muscle in my chest coughing and throwing up the delicious roast beef.  

For the love of all that is holy.  Small bites folks.  Small fucking bites.  I have seen and done a lot of things in my life and I can assure you, there is nothing as scary as trying to breath, and not being able to.  I keep waiting for someone to call the room because surely the maid had to tell someone that I was possibly dying in their hotel room.  Nope.  You got to love the city.",25Jan2017,1

There were times in the past where she would text me and tell me it's mainly because she's mad at her boyfriend and needs someone to talk to. 

So I haven't spoken to her in 2 weeks and she just now sent me a message. I don't want to text her back because I don't want to be that person who she falls back on when her man isn't around. On the other hand I'm bad at keeping grudges.",25Jan2017,1

I've kinda been just thinking that if I don't need to say stuff in every convo, but in reality I need to get in them to fully immerse myself in the convo. 

Like I love my friend group and other groups we mingle with recognizes me as a nice kid, but I only become friends with people while in a class with them. If I just opened up a little bit then I might be more social and maybe a little happy I don't know.

12,"Man I love this girl but she doesn't even know it.
I think about her everyday, I just don't know how to show it. I just wish she knew I was committed. If all goes well hopefully ill put a ring on it.

Has life ever given you a second chance? I got my second chance. I still feel bad about what I did to her, but a part of me knows its for the better. I did get jealous, I admit it, I know she's the one because I can not stop caring. Ever since I met her I knew I was in love, I still feel bad for the mistake I had done, but she has a forgiving heart, its like nothing can tear us apart, I've had tears for her, and she had tears for me. I was a typical cunt to her, I didn't know what I had til I lost it, but now, I found it again. Its true love. She's different from most girls, I can't put my finger on it, but she's nicer than most, I really just want to make her happy. Because when I was with her, as long as she was happy, I was happy. It was like we has had this spiritual bond. I don't know what to do or how to say it, but I wanna confess my love like I once did. I know its going to be a heavy serious talk, because I know she's the one. Ever since we fought, every girl who I've tried to like, I've only ever thought about her. I feel like I'd be betraying her again and stuff.  I haven't been able to find what we once had. She's the first person who was emotionally able to complete me. She filled the hole in my heart, that I would fill with various toxic things like overeating, sexual depravity, getting high and other toxic ingredients. She WAS my high. When I was with her, she made my whole world. I didn't feel the need to gorge myself anymore, I didn't feel the need to get off all because the love and kindness she radiated. She gave me hope to better myself. She was the first to make me feel like that, and I want her to be the last, til death do us part as they say. Recently I've decided to get her into naruto and we've been watching over Skype, and I'm planning on waiting til [hinata confesses to naruto that she loves him or even until “The Last” where he finally realizes it.](/spoiler) I don't really know where else to go with this but, I love you.",25Jan2017,1
14,"i think my recent teaching excursion has left me with a sense of purpose. i  help out with homework at a neighborhood daycare and the kids there range from 2nd to 5th grade. the 5th grade girls are a ruckus. they have no respect for authority and realize that they will no longer need after school care once they enter middle school. it's bittersweet that this will be my last time seeing them. they told me they need help with choreography for their drama class. that night i went home and thought about moves i can teach them. i told them i would post them on youtube. it made me feel a sense of purpose. the younger kids annoy me by hugging me and it's a matter of bribing them with food for good behavior. i was at risk of being fired for not controlling them well enough but i think i can make it work. ive slowly began to grow attached to them as a big brother figure. they each have their problems to work on. the 2nd grader is an immigrant and has a poor grasp of both her native language and english. she also has a speech defect which makes her sound like she has braces. i feel very worried about her as for a second grader, she cannot form simple sentences nor understand spoken english. for her i will need to try extra hard to bring her at least to spoken proficiency. the 3rd grade boy is shy of speaking with an accent but i've coerced him to speak out more by playing pokemon with him. the older girls are split in terms of level. three of them are quite skilled with only problems in tense. the other two struggle a bit with english and one of them avoids reading period. i feel worried for her since she doesnt even care. english was my second language but i picked it up in sixth months after starting kindergarten. it's been some time since they've flown here but their progress is meager. one even refuses to speak english as if hearing it gives her a headache. she's on point with her copying but copying doesnt equate to mastery. i guess theyre too young to understand how much of handicap it is. but i promised them that if they improve their english i'll throw a party for them.

1) I know the tattoo is for me/inspired by me because it is a symbol I draw everywhere inside of the cartoon ghost I signed all of my notes/letters to him with, and only used for him,
1a) it is placed on his body under my favorite skeletal bone (clavicle), where we had discussed ME getting a  tattoo. 

2) we dated freshman year, casually, I ended it (twice?), and it ended okayish.

3) it is now senior year.

4) I only recently found out that he had gotten this tattoo, but it was definitely after we had broken up that it appeared, though exactly when is unknown.

5) He and I don't talk. I would be fine with it, he isn't, so we don't bc consent and all that. 

I just really don't know why he would have gotten a tattoo of symbols that I used AFTER we broke up in such a specific spot, and I am not sure whether to be flattered or creeped out. I want to ask him, but again, he doesn't want to talk to me. advice? thoughts? personal experiences?",25Jan2017,3

64,"My buddy and I were taking a flight together.  We purchased the tickets separately, but it was the exact same flight and we had adjacent seats.

I woke up the day of the flight to emails from the airline letting me know that doing an online check-in would make my boarding experience smoother.  I followed the steps, printed my boarding pass, and felt accomplished that I didn't have to bother with kiosks and lines at the airport.  

A few hours later, I meet up with my buddy as we were going to carpool to the airport together.  I ask him if he did the early check-in and he said no.  He usually just does it on his phone and shows them the boarding pass that way.  Fair enough.  I could have done the same, but I'm semi-paranoid of not having reception and/or my phone battery dying in these situations, so I felt good that I was prepared with my printed boarding pass.  Right before we left, I decided to check if there were any delays so we wouldn't have to be waiting longer at the airport than necessary.  My intuition was right and it was delayed by a whopping 2 hours.  We killed some time, got some food and watched some TV.  The flight was delayed another 2 times for a total delay of 5+ hours.  We still left the house with plenty of time to get to the airport and through TSA.  

When we arrived, TSA was checking boarding passes as they always do before you get to the line to check your carry-ons and x-rays.  My buddy checked in during the Uber ride over, showed his boarding pass to the Agent on his phone, and he was through.  I confidently pulled out my printed boarding pass that I diligently printed out about 8 hours ago.  The TSA Agent looked at my pass and noticed that the boarding time was many hours ago which obviously threw up a red flag.  I explained that the boarding pass was printed before the flight was delayed and attempted to prove it by showing the Flight # on my phone and it's current status of the boarding time.  TSA Agent didn't even bother looking and said she would have to double check with the airline.  Meanwhile, she asks me to stand off to the side and starts letting other people in the line through.  Finally, the crowded line is dwindling down and the agent finally gets a chance to call my airline and confirm the flight # and that it was in fact delayed.  I was waved through, but this whole situation took up a good 20 minutes of my time.  Additionally, my buddy and I had to wait alone in the TSA check line afterwards which took about 30 minutes.  Really sucked that something I prepared in advance to make things run smoother ended up costing me more time and stress.  ",25Jan2017,7

71,"This is mostly a vent, but it's political. Hopefully some of you out there have some advice or words of wisdom.

We're on day 3/infinity and things keep getting crazier. We've got the gag order on the EPA and USDA, the arrest of journalists, the false accusations of voter fraud, the reversal of citizen-affirmed laws with no vote in South Carolina that allows for bribes, the continuation of the pipelines, the possible permanent gerrymandering and split electoral college votes in swing states that ensure we never have another liberal commander-in-chief, etc. etc. etc.

What the hell do we do? The only kind of resistance I've seen was one lawsuit about Trump's conflict of interest, but it's small potatoes, and nobody has mentioned it since. It seems to me that   Trump and his empowered posse are twisting and breaking the law enough every day to be hit with a constant stream of lawsuits, but... nothing. His horrible selections keep getting confirmed with no fanfare. 

People keep saying ""We'll get him in the midterm"" but that's two years from now. Look what he's done in three days. Can we wait two years? What can we do right now? How can we slow this process of losing the republic? 

Thanks for any insight here, everyone.",25Jan2017,1

I have a weird memory of me staring at a girls boobs and her zipping up her sweater offended. I'm pretty sure this was a dream but i have no idea. Well, I have class today and i have so much anxiety, i hope i no one looks down at me especially my professor.",25Jan2017,1
