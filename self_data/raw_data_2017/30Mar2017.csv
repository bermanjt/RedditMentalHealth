0,"So I have a work laptop and a personal laptop which are very similar MacBook models.  I opened up what I thought was my personal laptop and went to an adult website, one of the front page ones, xvideos I think.

Anyways I was on there for about 30 seconds before I realized I was on my work laptop and promptly freaked the fuck out.  Now I'm terrified I'm going to get fired.  It was an honest mistake.

I was in private browsing mode on safari, and afterwords I reset Safari and deleted all cached files and cookies for safari and flash video cache in the library folders, and I tried to do what I could to do more sophisticated clean ups such as removing mDNSResponder logs etc.  I wasn't connected to a VPN, just my regular private wifi.

I have the sole admin account on my work laptop, and as far as I can tell there's no spyware or rootkits on it, but there is Trend Micro Security on it which blocks you from visiting what it considers to be malicious sites (which this adult website was not) and compiles temporary logs of these suspicious sites (I think), so I think unless someone literally runs forensic recovery on my HD I should be ok.

Yes I know I'm a horrible unethical human being for jeopardizing company property, but like I said I'm freaking out and have no where to turn for advice but to the anonymous denizens of the internet.",30Mar2017,3

6,"I see the same mentality in this manager as I did with school yard bullies. Not only the need to constantly have someone beneath them but to have other people know it. This person is a horrible person, he swears and verbally abuses staff, has gotten into fights with staff, lies, cheats, steals. Abuses customers. Abuses suppliers. The owner loves him. This manager has the gift of the gab and makes himself indispensable in the owner's eyes. Those who spoke up, like myself, always found themselves in more trouble.

So I'm ten years into this job. I love it. Everyday I'm in with a smile. I look forward to coming to work. I get on really well with the other staff and are friends with a few of them outside of work because of it.

But, at each meeting, the owner speaks to me directly in front of everyone saying attitude is important, we can't have negative attitudes, etc. Today it was said by name instead of just glaring at me while he spoke. Other staff were appalled. It turns out this manager is feeding lies to the owner in order to make himself look better - ...I guess?

Anyway. Instead of being upset I exercise what I learned many years ago when dealing with bullies. **They're** the problem, not you. You can't expect others to change, you can only change yourself. And I guess I'm kinda happy because instead of just crying and getting upset I'm really proud of myself for simply being capable to thinking: 'You always act with a good heart, help others whenever possible, have a positive outlook on things.' I've come a long way from being suicidal and depressed (something the manager knew which makes what he does so so so much worse).

Things can be overwhelming at times - even most of the time! - but it can get better. Being able to think highly of yourself takes a lot of time and honestly a lot of effort but it can be done, just gradually over time, probably many years like it took me. Find things you love doing, treat others in good faith even if you're feeling shit and you'll find your insides will start to warm up again and eventually you'll find that fire has reignited all on its own.",30Mar2017,188

He's the type of person that becomes an engineer or doctor or someone valuable and then there's me who spends all this time actively trying to understand the material and doing mediocre.

I've started meditating regularly 20 minutes a day (I wish I could do more but I got more school work and food and toilet to get to) because that will at least provide me with fulfillment later down in life.

15,"He left easly, with no problem. He loved me and hurt me. He lied he would do anything for me, but I was not even on the second place in his life. He loved work and fame too much. He loved attention and to flirt. He couldn't keep his promises. He was invading privacy, he would dig into things you told him to wait until you are ready to share that part of the soul. 
He would never apologize! He would just answer with a hateful remark as an answer. He was afraid to take me to his family. He was afraid of judgement. Judgement because I am other religion than him. With me, he had no complexes, he was strong. With others, he would change so much towards me. 

I used to hate him for that. He offended me many times and he left many times for days, then coming like nothing happened. Until one day, when I could not handle it anymore! I ended this! It destroyed me long enough!!!

I knew he would never change! 

I made him a man. I made him responsible. I taught him love, respect. I taught him to have no fear, to be ambitious. He just took all of these and left. Without looking back. 

I told him to stop hurting me. I told him I can't do this anymore! He just said 'ok' and left. Like nothing happened. Without keeping contact. 

But i know i did the right thing! I used to hate him for not showing the slightest remorse of his actions. But hate would consume me. I refuse to live in hate. I am at peace now. Deep down I have a pain for all the wasted time, but overall I know it was my choice and I had also good moments with him. I want to say that I learned something, but I just feel I taught him more. But I'm ok with it. I guess I hope he may remember me, the one who was supposed to be his wife one day. He will miss me deep down, but he will always replace my presence with other people. He has the ability to do it. 

I am at peace, I found better. I have better. I realized how much I neglected myself in the past. It is time to wash my wounds and hug my soul. My time has come. ",30Mar2017,1

It all probably started around the summer of junior year of high school. 

I got a job working at a donut shop, and I had to wake up ungodly early. Like 4 am. It being summer, all my friends slept in super late, so when I got off work (about mid day) I didn't have anyone to hang out with. By the time night rolled around, I was too tired to go out.

Eventually, I ended up feeling incredibly lonely. So lonely I would go home and cry. I had never been this emotional in my life. I had figured that those ""angsty teen years"" had caught up to me late, because I had never felt this sad in my life for this long. 

Then a shocking revelation had struck me. I was about 17 years old and had never even kissed a girl before. 

I started looking into being more attractive and picking up girls, because hey, what else are you supposed to do when you're a lonely, clueless, teenage guy.  

I was hooked on this idea of being cool, confident, and charismatic. I had always been a dorky dude, and this was the shit I needed to fix it. Unfortunately no matter how hard I tried to be cool, I was still a pretty fucking dorky dude, and not many more people liked me for it. 

Eventually I realized I was going way too far over the top, and needed to chill the fuck out. Good thing high school was over, college was going to be a new start. 

Around the time college started, it all clicked. I was the cool collected guy I wanted to be. I joined a frat and started meeting a ton of girls. Even made out with a bunch.

I even landed my first girlfriend! She was kinda cute and talented. To be honest I don't think we were that great a pair, but it was my first opportunity for a relationship so I took it. Soon I became my old dorky, needy self, and after a month she had enough. I respect her decision, and dont blame her for anything. 

But at the time I was livid. I was hell bent on self improvement and never being lonely again. I read a shit ton of PUA material, and started learning what it means to be ""Alpha"" (its all a joke btw)

This shit was like poison that kind of fucked up my thinking. I started micro managing every interaction determining if I came off ""alpha"" or ""beta"" (spoiler, this level of micro management made me feel and act like a dork) 

It even started to permeate into interactions with old friends and frat bros, and I couldn't get along with them as well anymore, and I felt slightly uneasy. 

Somehow I managed to make out with the first girl I actually really liked and thought was gorgeous. Crazy about her from the top down.

Things were going well and there were whispers from friends that she wanted to have sex with me, and didn't know what to think about me in terms of a relationship. I know that doesn't sound good but I figured I could swing it. Tons of drama broke out and she didn't really want anything to do with me. 

This was like the original girlfriend break down, but magnified 10x over. 

I had to change. I had to be better. I was tired of being alone and not being someone a girl could like and want to be with. The PUA material (shit) increased, the Alpha mannerisms increased, and so did the emotional damage. I could only connect with about 3 good friends and my dad anymore. Everyone else I got nervous talking to out of fear of coming across as a little bitch. 

I posted the best pictures on social media to convince the gorgeous girl I was the shit and that she should come back. And eventually she did.  But it turns out it was basically for attention after some other guys used her and left. And only when she wanted something from me like invites to parties. 

This fucked me up pretty bad. I started to skip the gym because I was afraid of running into her and being a ball of nerves (Ive started to get fat and lose a ton of progress I had made). Then I started getting nervous when I started seeing her friends around out of fear of them talking to her about me.  

I tried meeting other girls, but my nervous micro managing ass doesnt do to well and hasnt had a date or anything in a long time, despite me trying. 

For some reason I keep scheming on how I can make it happen with her again. 

**The Advice Part**
----

So if you haven't read the part above, essentially I have a hard time being happy with myself and not seeking approval from other people and girls I'm interested in. 

As a matter of fact, this probably makes it harder to get approval from said people. 

So what is it I could do that could help me achieve this sense of self confidence, and not be needy. Or make me more attractive?

Thanks and have a nice day!",30Mar2017,10
17,"It's been about 3 months that I broke up with my Ex. I have these phases where I just can't stop thinking of getting back with her and I'm starting to think that this must be a sign.


The reason I broke up with her is because I felt that it was toxic for both of us.


**I)** She went to go see this guy behind my back (who I knew was a douchebag and that she previously had a crush on. This guy who I had never met) added me on facebook and just sent me a photo of her with his thumbs up and then unfriended me.


**II)** I caught her texting him multiple times behind my back even after that happened.


**III)** She always put my friends down.


**IV)** she was on tinder texting +10 dudes super flirty when I was next to her (technically we were not together but we started seeing each other again and were just coming out of a break after having a relationship for a year and a half)


**V)** She went clubbing a lot with her girlfriends and knew a lot of promoters.


**VI)** I caught her in lies multiple times.


Thing was I broke up with her then and then once we got back together I can tell that she was putting a lot of effort by learning from her mistakes and not doing what she did previously. However, I just could not give myself 100 % to the relationship because I was not over the things that she had done.

Thus, I ended it again. The moment I ended it she went straight back on tinder and danced with guys in front of my best mates (when they were on vacation together we have the same friend group)

I know that all I am saying are negative things, but yea she can be an amazing girlfriend when she wants too. She can be super sweet and sometimes I feel as if perhaps I made her jealous making her do those things to deal with jealousy. I am far from perfect I will admit but doing the things I mentioned above would never ever cross my mind.

Every time I see her though I have these strong feelings of anger, anxiety, frustration for the things that she had done within our relationship. Last Friday out of coincidence we ended up going to the same club and I just was on edge during the whole night, I was looking forward the whole week to this event. I hated that she was having fun, I hated that she was surrounded by guys, I hated that was there.

I fought the need to contact her after that night but out of the blue, she calls me the night after wanting to check up on me and talking about how much of a coincidence it was that we were at the same club. She then texts me the day after saying that she is happy that **'we are on good terms..'**


I resent the things that she did to me, I resent the fact that she keeps on trying to get into my life, I resent the idea that she is clubbing with her friends, I resent the possibility that she is getting with other guys, I resent the possibility that she is doing all those things which she said were stupid when we were together, I resent her.

However, I do not want to feel this way, I know that it is destructive. I do not want to let all this anger and hate control my emotions, I do not want my healing process to be retarded because I can't let go of the past.

I just do not know what to do... Should I write her a message saying that I forgive her for everything that she had done, will that make me feel better? Should I talk to her and get closure for the things that happened between us? She completely shot up my self-confidence and trust; she was manipulative.

I didn't break up with her because I didn't love her, I broke up because I loved myself too much to let her hurt me anymore.
She literally just texted me 5 minutes ago asking &gt;""How r ya""

I want to get back with her, I want to shout at her, I want to never see her again.
I just dont know what I want.

Currently, I'm a junior at high school. Compared to the immense amount of drama-queens that attend my school, I like to believe I'm a pretty simple guy. Since the beginning of my junior year, I've had a crush on a very special girl. While this crush had started out as a small, insignificant, and meaningless idea, it has become, what I feel, is a burning desire to be loved by this girl. I know most people may feel I am too young to understand what true love is; however, if I can promise you all anything, it's that this girl is the one for me. **Let me explain...**

Before a couple of months ago, I had only spoken to this girl around school, mostly at Friday night football games or our school's band competitions. (She's the captain of the color guard team!) Slowly, we started spending more time together. Things really kicked off a couple of months ago. My best friend, who knew about my crush on this special girl, decided to plan something for all of us to do. So, at the end of that school week, we planned to head up to Raleigh, NC to eat at a small Irish restaurant and see a movie. 

That Friday, I picked up my best friend, my crush, and another friend of mine. *(We'll just call her ""my friend"", while calling my best friend ""my best friend"".)* Anyway, the 45-minute car ride was filled with my crush making a few witty comments that were aimed at ""picking"" on me. Once we got to the restaurant, she sat with my best friend on the opposite side of the booth. While we ate, when I went to talk, instead of being on her phone like my two friends were, she held my eyes while I spoke and had no trouble keeping the conversation going. After we ate, my best friend decided it'd be best if we stopped by the mall to buy a movie there to watch back at my house, so we did just that. Once we got to the mall, I pulled up to the front of the mall, allowing everyone to get out of the car; however, she refused to get out, saying she didn’t want me walking alone. As we entered the mall, she immediately pulled me off to go and try out this trampoline jump station. It’s worth mentioning this girl isn’t big on being all “touchy touchy”. As the trampoline was being prepared for her to jump on, she placed my hand over her heart, telling me to feel her heartbeat. She held it there for a couple of seconds before returning it to my side. After she got her turn on the ride, we met up with my two friends and went back to my house to watch a movie. While at my house, she cuddled up next to me during the movie, resting her head on my shoulder. She soon fell asleep within 15-minutes of starting the movie. When she woke up, she commented, ""We are way too close!"" However, she barely moved over any. After the movie ended, I took my friend home. Then, with my best friend and my crush in the car, I drove to take her home.
	
Over the next few weeks after this, we’ve talked more. We text, Facetime, and Snapchat! We’ve had serious conversations too! She actually opens up to me. Her best friend has even been talking to one of my friends! Her best friend has said things along the lines of…“Does he like her?”...“They’ve been getting along pretty well!” **Should I try and figure out from her best friend whether I have a shot or not?**

This is where things get complicated. My ex-girlfriend, who I dated for two and a half years, is also in color guard; therefore, they’ve been *casual* friends. My ex isn’t exactly over me at the moment, so she’s constantly trying to prevent me from spending time with my crush. For example, me and my crush were supposed to be watching a movie at my house a couple of weekends ago, but our plans were ruined when my ex-girlfriend sent a text message to my crush, stating she didn’t feel comfortable with just the two of us being alone together. In all, this frustrated me. Why should my ex-girlfriend have any right to intervene with who I want to spend my time with? Why should my ex-girlfirend have to ruin a potential relationship for me? My crush ended up canceling on me, apologizing and explaining we should have considered how my ex-girlfriend would feel. My crush hates confrontation. She can’t stand for anyone to be mad at her. She tries her best to please everyone, never putting herself first. This is one of the main reasons I feel as if I’ll never be able to date her. Eventually, my ex-girlfriend texted her, stating she no longer cared if me and my crush spent any time together. Still, my crush will never consider dating me until she knows it won’t hurt my ex-girlfriend.

Today, I’m happy as ever. She asked me to go get frozen yogurt with her after school, which I happily obliged to. We talked for an hour and a half, sitting close with our arms tangled together. We even planned to hang out Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday! Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday we have planned to attend our school’s play to support many of our friends that play a role in it! Friday, I convinced her to allow me to pick her up from her house, so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant (Her Favorite) and go back to my home for a scary movie! I’m glad I’m able to spend a lot of time with her this week, but I need advice on what I should be doing. **Should I embrace our flirtatious manner and push it a little farther than we’ve been? (Cuddling during the movie, hugging her before she leaves, etc.) If so, how do I go about doing those things?**

I know this is all a lot to take in. Most of it probably sounds stupid, but I’m tired of repeatedly asking my friends for advice. They’re just as confused as I am. I really want to make things work with this girl. I don’t have to be in a relationship with her by tomorrow, but I’d like closure knowing I won’t lose her to someone who’d be easier to date. I have to make things work. I want to take her time. I want to eventually call her mine. She’s been cheated on four times by a guy she really thought she loved. I want to be everything she needs and more. I could go on and on. Thank you all for listening. **Any comments or advice will be greatly appreciated!**

**TL;DR; : What should I do when me and my crush hang out more? Do I push our flirtatious manners a little more or try and just be friends? How do I lead this into a relationship? Does she even like me?**",30Mar2017,4

28,"For the record, I'm a heavily left leaning voter, now more than ever.

But I'm sick of the name calling and disrespect on both sides, especially by liberals because it's like, I agree with you! But when you act like an asshole to the people you disagree with, and then act like you have the moral high ground to do so, it actively TURNS people away from your ideology. When you call the other side stupid, racist, fascist, to their FACE, it's more likely they will double down on what they believe instead of consider your opinion. Like, you can say that shit to your friends who agree, I'm not saying ""don't be mad,"" but don't use those words in an argument with someone who disagrees, because in what fucking universe would they hear you out?

I remember during the women's march, there a popular image of a woman in a hijab that looked like an American flag. It's clear that the intent of the image was simply to promote unity with muslims in our country. The next fucking day people on my fb were sharing articles about how the image was 'problematic,' like what the fuck are you doing, you're driving moderates away from your cause. You read one fucking blog post and now you're better than the rest of us?

You can believe whatever you want, but think rationally for one fucking second: how do you draw more people to your cause? When you complain about ""white people,"" it makes white people UNCOMFORTABLE. That is a fact. It doesn't matter if your argument holds water or not. When you say shit like ""ugh this is the problem with white people/straight people/cis people/men,"" it's extremely alienating and polarizing. You're actively doing your cause a disfavor by turning the moderate majority away. How can you pretend to be an activist if you're doing your own cause harm?

I was back in the old church where my Dad was once the senior pastor. Now, I'm not religious anymore, and a lot of it has to do with that church. When I realized where I was I got very anxious. It was almost about to become a nightmare. I could feel it. For whatever reason I walked in the sanctuary. There were a lot of people there. But then I looked in one of the pews. All of my closest​ friends were there. It was so shocking. One of them pulled me to her to sit next to her. I sat down, we started holding hands, and gradually we just became intertwined. I remember I rested my head on her shoulder, and felt a huge weight on my chest disappear. I don't remember if there was anything going on, or if anyone was speaking, but the dread I had been feeling before just washed away.

It was a simple dream, but to me it was incredibly powerful. My anxiety has been a constant struggle in my life, and feeling that moment of it being lifted away made me so happy.

37,"I (26/M) guess I'm just a Californian neo-hippy after all. Last year I moved out from my parent's place, moved to Seattle, WA and became an Uber driver, clocking 60-80 hours every week while I paid off credit card debt and lived in a six-man tent hidden in a grove of trees on a farmer's field. This was the happiest time of my life. I saw so much of the city every day, chatted with so many interesting people, ate fresh fruit every morning, bathed in lakes and dried out in the sun, had a flexible schedule so I could always get coffee or read a book or go on a hike or sunbathe on the beach whenever I wanted. I was even going on dates. My life was simple, work was stress-free, I felt self-actualized every day.

I thought the account management job offered to me by a start-up would be a step up, and it is much safer and pays more, but I find working 60-80 hours in front of a computer and with much of that involving calling up busy people who don't really want to talk to me is SO MUCH MORE difficult than driving people around for the same amount of time. I'm gaining skills, building a network, yes... this looks like the beginning of a career to me, but I am miserable. I live in an apartment now and am no more happier than when I was in a tent, in fact paying hundreds of dollars for rent and utilities pisses the royal fuck out of me (I don't know how you all do it). My foam pad and sleeping bag were as comfy and warm as my bed is now. I guess it is true that I can wash dishes/clothes easily and invite friends over now, it's more socially acceptable. I am safer behind locked doors and with a fire alarm... but I am also much more stressed about money, even if I'm making more of it, because now I have these huge bills to pay every month. When I was homeless I only paid for food, my phone plan, entertainment, and car expenses.

Lately, I've been fantasizing just walking out of the office, and going back to my fun, adventurous life as a homeless Uber driver. But I know even that can't last since self-driving cars are just around the corner. I've got to develop marketable skills if I'm going to survive this cruel world. Ugh, but I really do not excel in an office environment... it really bores me to death, I feel like I'm rotting indoors every day.",30Mar2017,11
39,"It sucks. All the anxiety I have isn't from some unbeknownst source, it's from me choosing/not choosing to do the things I know are right and ought to do. 

All the depression I have is from being stagnant, not growing, and procrastinating: creating a lack of motivation, an endless cycle growing self-loathing because I don't do the things I need to.

All of my dysfunction and instability came from doing club drugs and drinking because I didn't want to deal with my problems.

All the relationships I've been in have gone sour because I don't have enough self-esteem=self-efficacy=self-respect to think I deserve being loved or some other subconscious reason.

I fuck my psyche because instead of choosing to be happy now, I always think the grass is always greener.

All of these aspects lead to indecision in a society that runs over people like me. 

Because I don't choose to make myself happy now, I look at the past and bring up all the nostalgic shit that eats at my core.

I escape. 

I've been diagnosed. I literally have nothing, just anxiety and a slight mood disorder because they can't fit me into any certain disorder. 

I am so impressionable. I just feel paralyzed sometimes, you know? Which is pathetic. 

Because I know all of the things I need to do to be happy and to succeed and to motivate myself but I'd rather sulk and steep in my own stinky fucking shit.",30Mar2017,38
40,"I posted a picture of a pie I made with a burnt crust on r/baking to get advice and almost immediately go a message from someone claiming to be a TV casting agent or something. Saying she was producing a show about people who try recipes over the internet and fail. 
She gave me a link to the imbd of the girl she was claiming to be. When I asked for further proof she acted like a link to imbd was more than adequate proof but offered to send me an email because her email address was the name of the person she claimed to be.
A link to imbd and an email address were her proof, even I could provide more to prove who I am. I never asked what sort of info she wanted from me in order to apply, but I'm guessing at the very least she would sell my email address.",30Mar2017,1
43,"So I kinda lost contact to all my friends (only had 3 to begin with), they all got girlfriends 2-3 years ago and slowly they started to ignore my messages.. I also never had a real girlfriend and have no idea how to approach one. I only had sex twice with some random girl, who had a boyfriend at the time I didn't know of.. 

I was a pretty slim guy so I started working out over a year ago. It's not like girls don't notice me, they smile at me in the train or subway but I'm way too shy to walk over to one and ask them (yeah ask them what exactly?). At college when there is a seat empty right next to a good looking girl, I just sit somewhere in the back alone, even tho they look at me interested. No idea what's wrong with me. I'm scared to approach new people and get rejected. If I want to approach someone new, I get pretty nervous and imagine the worst things, so I just leave. 

I don't go out at weekends because I don't want to go alone somewhere and don't rly know someone to go with. My weekends are pretty much just staying at home or going to the gym. I don't talk to anyone at the gym because it feels weird to approach some dude or girl there when they just want to workout in peace.

I have no idea what to do with my life,  I don't want be alone, I can't talk  just with my parents.. I want to talk to a friend about problems, I want to go out and have fun with friends. My life is just going to the gym, college and watching tv series.  I hate it. In my darkest days I think about joining a cult because there at least people would ""like"" me.. 

That was pretty long but I needed to get this off my chest, sry if it's too long.",30Mar2017,4

Are they crappy to breed? 

Do they just not make logistical sense to eat?

48,"It's a bit of a rant.

**Background**

I'm a Dad of two awesome girls aged 5 &amp; 7.   I own a business and I'm lucky enough to pick my own working hours now (after years of working like a slave 80+ hours/week).   I do this even though it means a lot less money in the bank because I really want to spend time with my girls while they are young.   My father was a workaholic who left for work at 4am and was asleep in his chair at 8pm each night.   I hardly saw the guy, and don't remember one family holiday with him there - Mum came along but Dad was always working.   Then he died way to young at 67.   When I had kids I was determined to be different.

My wife works a normal job that has her occupied each day so I take care of most of the normal duties looking after young kids.   Breakfasts, school lunches, I cook all the dinners, I do the school drop offs and pickups, I volunteer for the school trips, organise the after school activities, do homework with them etc.   My wife is great with the kids too but I like to make sure her time is spent having as much fun with them as possible and not doing the mundane stuff - I can take care of that.   In our marriage this works great (it's our 10th anniversary today!).

I absolutely love hanging out with my kids - hearing other Dads sitting back, not helping, and having a whinge about spending time with their kids at sports etc just drives me mad (but I'll get back to this).   These are the best times - I get to play with my kids until I'm too uncool to play with :)

**The Problem**

Today I took my girls to school and the youngest one had a school trip planned out on a boat to a marine reserve.   I had volunteered a long time back to help with the trip - driving kids along and helping out at the park afterwards with lunches etc.   I turned up to the school and was told that I was only able to take my own child on the 10 minute drive to where the boat was picking them up.   Other cars were loaded with kids - completely full - three child carseats over the backseat of a small car an one in the front seat - parents will know how packed this is.   But for myself and the other Dad that volunteered - just our big cars and only our child in them.   It was fairly obvious the reason why we had been excluded.   Driving to the boat my 5yo daughter asks me ""Dad, why is no one ever allowed to come in our car?   I really wanted Lucy to come in our car."".   What do I tell her?   Even she notices that it happens all the time.

And that's the problem.   This isn't a one off occurrence.   This has happened consistently from kindergarten with both my kids.   Every time there is a school trip, parent school visits, birthday parties etc it's quite clear that the men are considered dangerous people that can't be trusted.   Women are left alone with children to supervise groups - men are always accompanied by an adult female - and clearly can't be trusted to look after a group of kids at the beach, museum, or a park.   When people talk to me at these events they seem utterly shocked that I cook the dinners, make the lunches, and dress my kids - like these are completely beyond the average male.   It makes me wonder if these attitude contribute to the lack of male parent involvement I mentioned earlier.   If you are constantly told you can't or shouldn't being taking part in your kid's lives - doesn't there come a point where you agree and give up?   Our society that demonizes males is creating a culture of absent male role models.   My father was absent because he had to work all the time.   The Dads I see in our local group are absent because they are told they shouldn't be involved.

There are no male teachers at my girls school.   There was only one male teacher at their last school.   There were no male teachers at their kindergarten.

So yeah, as I said this was a bit of a rant.   Hopefully some people read it and consider that there are a lot of us good Dads out there.   We changed the nappies (diapers), we love the school trips, we bake the cakes for the birthday parties, and we have tea parties with our kids.   Just because a guy wants to hang around with his kids and their friends and have fun at the beach or park doesn't make him a predator - it makes him a good Dad.   

This attitude towards men is so similar to racial profiling that it should be talked about more.   Kids need men involved in their lives too.
