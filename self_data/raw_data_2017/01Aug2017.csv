0,"Hi

I'm 22 living with my parents, working a dead end job making 12 an hour. Jumping from relationship to relationship, heartbreak to heartbreak. My life sort of sucks and I can't see it going anywhere. I'm a real loser

On the bright side I just discovered Rick and Morty. It's pretty awesome and I've been binging. 

What are you guys up to",01Aug2017,1

Somehow the fact that he's a man completely passed me by until he was in Parks and Rec and I realized I had been wrong for like 10+ years. And everyone I tell this to thinks I'm crazy.",01Aug2017,1

5,"Man, I'm fucking fed up. I feel like fucking BoJack Horseman. Technically my life's completely fine, and I fuck it up. I can see the mistakes I make and why I make them. I have a constant need to feel liked by everyone that turns me into a fucking pushover and means I never just do what I truly want. Hell, I don't even fucking know what I want anymore. And yet I'm too crippled by depression, fear, laziness, whatever else to change anything.

It's just constant. I want to do something meaningful, but I spend every spare weekday I have wasting away in my room. The weekends I get drunk/high with friends and try find some temporary happiness. I go to college and can't tell if the course isn't for me or I'm just too unmotivated to try anymore. Either way I've made no friends after a full year there and I've considered dropping out multiple times. I would have by now if it wasn't for how disappointed people would be in me. I'd have literally nothing, apart from a shitty part time job that I consider quitting more and more everyday, with the only thing stopping me being a futile crush I have on a coworker that I cling onto for no reason (especially considering she has a fucking boyfriend). It's sad really; the person I'd be if I had things my way is an unemployed college drop out.

I'm given chances to change shit though and I just fucking don't. Little moments of potential happiness that I sabotage myself with. But beyond all that I think the thing I crave most is true human connection, I try so hard to just be liked by people. And 99% of the time people do really like me, but nobody really KNOWS me. You know? Apart from maybe one or two of my very closest friends, nobody has a clue what inside my head's like. I'm just a nice, approachable and funny guy.

But man inside I feel like I die a bit everyday. There's two times I'd say I feel happy; when I am out at the weekend with friends and have a night where I feel like I truly connect with them, and when I'm around that girl from work I mentioned. I'm just desperate for someone to 'fix' me, but nobody can. I push people away for some subconscious reason. I never truly completely open up with my friends; the closest I've got is making sarcastic jokes about hating myself and being depressed (which have far more truth than they would ever believe). 

And with that girl I'm 100% sure she liked me at one point. Like really was properly into me. I've never been that sure before. We were like best friends at one point. But I was too scared to take a chance and now she's dating someone else. That's tough to deal with man. Knowing that someone actually valued me that much and I just pissed it away. We still talk in work and shit, but it's just not the same. I think we both realise what happened between us. For a few weeks after she started dating this guy we didn't talk much at all, when before we talked everyday. She's recently tried to reach back out to me, even inviting me out with her and her closest friends for her birthday. I just joked that I have a busy schedule and I'd have to see. Plus we're not really in the same social circle. She really wanted me there though; she even told me I could bring a friend along. But again, out of fear and a bunch of other shit I just can't face going. I'm scared to go out without my friends there; I'm scared of saying something to her I regret; I know I'd get jealous of her and her boyfriend; I know I'd ultimately be fooling myself into thinking I can have a close friendship with someone I clearly want much more with. And the thing is if I wasn't so fucking scared of just being honest with people, I might have had.

Really that whole situation actually sums me up now that I've typed it out. I want some close human connection, but when someone comes along and smacks me in the face trying to be there for me, and wants to know me, I fuck it up somehow. I don't do anything, and ultimately I push them away cause I'm too scared and can't face people when I know I fucked up with them. I just want to please everyone, and in the end by trying I only push people away. I can't be honest about who I am. I want someone to be there for me, but it's impossible if I can't fix my own shit. I can't open up to people, and the minute I feel vulnerable about my feelings I actively try to close myself off. It's a shitty shitty cycle.

**TL;DR:** Life feels hollow, cause right now I'm unsatisfied/unhappy with almost everything I do. The only time I feel remotely happy is when I'm on the verge of some human connection, but as soon as I feel myself getting vulnerable with someone or have to admit how I feel deeps down, I withdraw, isolate myself and somehow fuck it up.

6,"They're in their 80's.  They're both sharp and active, but they've got problems now.  Neither of them has good balance.  My pop fell a few times yesterday.  He wasn't hurt, but he broke a faucet trying to pull himself up.

They still drive.

They've as much as told me than when one of them checks out, the other one isn't sticking around.

That call is coming soon. 

I'm trying to reherse it in my mind, so I'll be prepared.  It's an approach the Stoics used.  Frankly, my stomach drops when I go through the scenarios.

When they are gone, I will be alone in the world.  Utterly unmoored.  

This is the way of things.  My feelings won't change the facts.  

This is some very heavy shit.",01Aug2017,2
8,"I feel like a guest in my own home;
I left this house as a high schooler. My mother worked her ass off working a minimum wage labor job in a book warehouse. I worked my ass off at my part-time food service job and stayed out and over with friends on the weekends. I never spoke too much to my mother.

I left this house after recovering from leukemia. You were with me everyday in the hospital and I was lonely and depressed at night. I left for college. I needed to brighten my future and move my life away from bad memories.

The longest I've stayed home was 2 months;
When I returned home, I knew it was temporary. I knew that in a couple months I'd be back at school with my friends again. To be in the place away from the bad thoughts. Two years go by and I only stay home to visit my father in the shelter or to attend a family party.

The relationship with my mother was strange. I would give her updates. ""I have three exams this week. I'm really nervous about it."", ""Wow, I can't imagine how hard those college classes are."", ""Hey mom, how do I fill out this tax form. Hey mom, the financial aid people aren't giving me my full amount this semester and I can't buy groceries, can we go to the dollar store to get me dinners? Hey mom, I'm working three jobs now. I'm making sure that I have the money that I need to support myself."", ""Gino, I really like this Trump guy. He's going to kick all those Mexicans out."" 

Maybe I like this version of my mom. She feels open enough with me for the first time to listen to my struggles and talk about her opinions. I never correct some of the vile things she says about people. I just know that she's from a different time than me and there's nothing I can really being her enemy.

She knows I drink now. Still doesn't know about all the weed I smoke. 

Moving home after graduating college;
I moved the room from my house in college into the guest bedroom. My high school bedroom was transformed into a piano/study room. This room mimics my college room, so no changes to my productivity. 

Mother comes home and wants to talk to me. She now seems sad and lonely. It's not about her feeling open to talking to me about things, it's that she doesn't have anyone to talk to. All of her family is moving out and her children only comes to talk to her with personal problems. She doesn't have a friend. She doesn't have someone she can talk to face to face. It's just her and her computer and her distant boyfriend. She talks to me because she needs it. I can see the sadness she has with her life and I don't have the relationship with her to talk to her about it.

But now I feel like a guest in my own house. I make sure not to leave a trace anywhere I go. I make sure to stay quiet to not wake my siblings. I wash my dishes and do my laundry and buy my own food. She's not my mom anymore. Just a roommate.

11,"I'm now an 18 year old male, and early junior year of high school I smoked for my first time. Little did I know, my blunt was laced with Coke... haha. Well ever since, I have slowly began to smoke more than ever, day to day. I smoked at lunch during school every day and now that the summer has hit I've expanded. I've taken xanax, opiates, shrooms, cocaine, etc... I worry that this experimenting has changed me to be a less empathetic person in all aspects of my life... Dulles me. I pull away from family, emotions, and have become careless towards the well being of others. But at the same time I don't see a problem with who I am. It is easy to not feel, to be guarded, and people almost look up to me in a sense. Is this bad? And is this onset of apathy just me growing up? Or the drugs? I plan on taking a 6-12 month tolerance break from all of this when I go into college in a few months, as I was able to come out of HS with a 4.3+ gpa and look to do similar things in college after establishing a foundation and learning the ropes, as I did for HS. Are my changes in personality/loss of empathy because of smoking weed,trying psychedelics, and various other drugs? Or is this just me changing with age?",01Aug2017,1
12,"I'm a 21-year-old male in college about to start my Junior year and I don't know if it's just me personally or a widespread phenomenon but I've noticed I just don't really have much in common with people in my age group. I've always gotten along with people who were older than me better but I just feel like I should still try and put myself out there and associate with people in my group but I have trouble caring about their priorities.

What I mean to say is that we've always been told that college is a time of discovery and change and while I think that's true I don't feel that it means that the change is always drastic. I feel like I've already come to terms with myself as a person and I feel relatively comfortable in my own skin. I wouldn't say that I've stagnated because I'm still always learning something new but for the most part I'd say that my core personality is pretty much set in stone.

I guess what I feel sets me apart is that I accept myself for who I am and it feels weird to reach this point already in life. The only person I feel a need to prove myself to is myself and no one else. 

Now, do I have flaws? Of course, I do but I know how to manage those aspects of my personality so that if they do cause me trouble I know how to mitigate them enough to where I can still do damage control.

This is great in the long term but in the short term, I feel that although I can be a good listener and conversationalist it's a lot more difficult for me to be genuinely interested in people in my age group than it is for someone even 7 years older. 

I just honestly feel bored by people in my age group. I've made a few good friends but when it comes to dating I feel that a lot of the concerns girls have are non-issues for me. I'm not going to be pompous and say that I'm a visionary or something like that but it's legitimately difficult for me to care about things that are supposed to be relevant for my age group. Things like: what will I do with my life? Who will I marry? Does he or she love me? I'm not even trying to sound harsh or ""edgy"" whatever that means.

Honestly, this level of self-assuredness scares the shit out of me sometimes but I just feel so tranquil and have very few concerns.

15,"So, for the past couple of months I've had sort of a stress type of feeling. To cut to the chase, I can't help but feel that the reason as to why I am constantly stressing and worried is because I'm more aware/mature/knowing than I was before. A year ago and a half ago, I was your average teenager. Didn't really care much about any of the worlds problems and stuff, or at least didn't seem to pay much attention unless it was big news or something. Something changed and now I'm much more aware of the world. I grew an obsession with history, literature, philosophy, politics, sciences (That I otherwise only knew because of I needed to pass a test) and much more stuff I wouldn't have liked. I'm still into things like social media and such but I know use it less often and tend to care less about. Now, when I play a video game, I look at the deeper meaning, story, development and what not. And for example, when a video game doesn't meet those expectations, it bums me out. Whereas a year ago, I'd like it no matter how much of a cash grab it was. I can't help but feel like despite me being more aware, mature, polite, curious ETC, I'd probably say that I am less content now, than ever before even though right now, I have nothing that I should be worrying about. When other kids my age are worrying about mostly meaningless things that they actually can change and worry about, I am here worrying about World issues that are completely out of my control. I feel more enlightened but at the same time, I always have a constant worry about things like when the next economic crisis will hit, when will the Syrian civil war will end, Why are we so drawn to tragedy, What WOULD the world be like if china had continued its expeditions, What if Gavrillo Princip hadn't shot the ArchDuke ETC. Just a bunch of issues running through my head when I don't have the answers to them. I feel more enlightened yet, I also feel more ""Depressed"" about the world. I'm constantly seeking more knowledge but the more and more knowledge I feel I'm getting, the more and more down right depressed I feel. Is it because these topics are generally very sad or ""hard"" to find a fix?  I want to be at peace with myself and continually seek more knowledge about everything I possibly can, but I feel burdened by that very knowledge. One last thing I can't stand thinking, is that I'll Die one day without knowing the answer an issue. HELP ME. ",01Aug2017,2
17,"On woz.org he has ""Autograph inquiries"" then his email. I emailed him. 10 days later his assistant replied with the following email:

""Hi John,

You can purchase signed Wozniak memorabilia from:

www.SignedByWoz.com

A percentage of the proceeds go to a charity of the Wozniak's choosing.

Thank you for your interest in Mr. Wozniak.

Heidi""

Let me break down how exploitative Wozniak reveals himself to be in this email:

He tells me I can purchase stuff that advertises him.

""A percentage"" could literally mean ""0.03%"".

""A charity of the Wozniak's choosing"", so I can't even choose the charity, ""the Wozniak"" does! For all I know he chose Westboro Baptist Church.

That is not a typo. Heidi actually addressed him in the email as ""the Wozniak"".

He pulled a bait and switch. If he had been honest and linked to his memorabilia store, that would've been fine. But instead he tricked me into thinking he autographed stuff for free if I requested it by email, made me wait 10 days, then had his assistant reply with a link to his store.

Nowhere on any of his sites does he even provide proof he's donated anything to any charity.

Wozniak is portrayed as this good guy that was the moral compass to Steve Jobs. But when he has the chance to exploit Apple fanboys, he jumps right on it.

My question is: Do I express my frustration with how they've been having me drive all around and the lack of communication?
Or do I wait and if something similar happens again I tell them everything isn't on thei

How lost and confused the child most likely is, and how much their lives will change.

I know others would take the helm and raise my child. I would still anguish that I could not be there for him. As those police officers cannot be there for their children. There would be no watching his daily discoveries. Enjoying his bedtime snuggles. Relishing in his sweet smile and mischievous grin. 

I would miss the chance to talk about what he learned during his first day of school. Teach him the form of a basketball shot or how to build a tree house. Comfort him through his first breakup. Encourage him through his first job interview. I would miss that; miss his life, which may sound selfish. It may be, but I would not want him to go through it alone. 

I want to be there for him. Support and comfort him when he needs it. I am proud of him now, and I would always want him to know I am proud. I hope that those kids who lost their dads will always know that. 

We cannot change the fate of life. The next corner always brings something unexpected. Tomorrow was not yesterday, and forever never last. Enjoy the moments. Let those around you know they matter.

  Long time reader, first time poster. A first time poster to Reddit altogether actually. I've contributed little aside from my time previously so have decided to share with the internet this journal I wrote whilst travelling across Europe in the summer of 2016.


  As I write this, I'm spending my summer working minimum wage in a kitchen, finding paying the rent on my flat to be a squeeze let alone being able to set money aside to go on any form of holiday.


  However, I do have free time on my hands, and thought I'd reminisce on last summer. I spent the month of August in 2016 travelling across Europe by rail. Flying into Berlin on the 31st of July and returning home from Amsterdam on the 1st of September.


  I'm doing this, both for my own enjoyment and to provide an account for anyone interested in interrailing or in the experience's of other user's travelling experiences.


  It'll be fun revisiting my trip and perhaps it'll give others an insight into what to expect in different cities across Europe as well as of the interrailing experience in general.


  I'll answer any questions regarding costs, temperature, convenience, food, people or any other facet of the story that redditer's find interesting or have queries about.


  This was my first solo trip and my first real experience of 'travelling'. Previous holidays for me were resort and beach based and I embarked on this trip with very little knowledge about the different countries and cities I'd be visiting or the process of interrailing itself. This will become apparent in my journal entries.
At the very least, hopefully someone gets a kick out of my story, just as I did writing it and living it.


  **A few things I'd like to mention before beginning:**


  -I shall post my story, day by day, and in the exact form that it was originally written save for any grammar or spelling mistakes I encounter upon typing it up. I will correct those. (There will probably be a few that slip under the net, but if the internet is not for correcting the grammar of others, what is it for?)


  -The only other change from the original journal I will be making is the removal of any identifying characteristics of myself or anybody else mentioned within the journal. I will give aliases to everybody encountered so as to protect the identities of all included who may not have expected their interactions with me would end up appearing on a Reddit post some day. All name's of nightclubs, hostels, restaurants, etc, are however legitimate and remain unchanged.


  -I am Scottish, not an author by any stretch of the imagination and I was big into Irvine Welsh at the time. Therefore some of the journal entries will contain the use of phonetics and regional/in-jokey slang. I can clarify what was meant by any particular word or phrase if necessary. The whole journal is informal and rather conversational. I write how I'd relay the story face to face.


  -This won't be your typical tourist brochure entry. There will be several entries which are NSFW and give accounts of experiences with drugs, alcohol, sexual encounters and even prostitution.


  -It took me a few days to really get into the flow of writing a journal. It's not something I'd done before and I think the first few entries are relatively weak. I do genuinely think it improves exponentially after a few entries. It becomes more informative and well rounded. I didn't think I'd stick to writing the journal at the start of the trip. I didn't really know how I'd format the journal either and it took me a little while to become comfortable in my writing style. So bare with me, it'll be worth it.


  -Finally, all entries are 100% true and were written usually the day after. The title of the journal is ""You Can't Chib a Chibber"". The name came to me a month or so after the journal was complete, it was untitled previously. 

  Without further ado, I present to you:


**YOU CAN'T CHIB A CHIBBER: PROLOGUE**


  This airport is fucking at it. Goes to the Wetherspoon's for some food. Their school dinner yellow box menu has been marked up by 500% so I just get on the peeve. £4.75 for a pint! For one fucking pint! That's brutal. And it tasted toxic on my empty stomach.


  Have to cut the peeving short on this occasion or I'll not make it out departures with a penny to my name. I mean, fuck me, this notebook cost me near enough a fiver. You could swipe these from the student union for nothing!


  I've no idea what this book will contain when it's all said & done. I'm going to chronicle my journey and just be 100% honest. There's sure to be some fucking stories contained within. Or maybe not. I have no idea what to expect from the next month's festivities. I have no idea what I've signed up for.


  The flight's been delayed, here's hoping that's to accommodate the wee dirty they have seated next to me. The airport is rammed, there's more cunts per square mile than I've seen before.


  But I look around, thinking...""soon"". In a matter of hours, this all begins. Apologies in advance to anyone who's picked this up, I'll try keep it clean.


  **DAY ONE: BERLIN**


Fuck me. The fairy tale certainly has a beginning.


I arrive at the hostel, there's a boy passed out on a bed. Immediately the thought has taken over, what the fuck do I actually do? I don't want to wake the boy, but at the same time, he's all I have. That first human contact - my information desk, my portal of knowledge.


  He wakes up eventually, not a bad chap to be honest. None of them are. The sleeper is Canadian, there's an American and two Chinese. There was a wee Scandinavian chap, cunt would bring me water when I stumbled in at 10 in the morning. Sound chap.


  Right, fuck. So I went for something to eat. Grabbed this bottle of vodka. A 70' for like €8.50 or something. Brutal. No wonder the guy at the shop had marked it down. Starts drinking with the American boy. He wants to stay in. They all do. After about three quarters of the bottle I'm convinced to go try reception for new drinking buddies.


  Opens the dorm door and clocks this wee Ozzie cunt in the face with it. His pal thought it was a right laugh so I end up tagging along on their night out. I get friendly with the group. Right wee mix; Ozzies, Kiwis, Mexicans, birds and guys.


  We go to this spot called Suicide Club. The interior looks like an abbatoir and they've got sprawling outside zones that look like the gardedn departments in Homebase. I'm right on it and what do you know? This place is jumping.


  *Here, my memory gets a bit hazy*. I end up in the female toilet with this wee gay German boy called Frank King, we're doing lines of speed. Can't remember how we got talking but the boy has definitely taken a shine to me. When the night was done I had about six missed calls from the cunt. He kept throwing me compliments all night telling me I had a big cock. Haha, that cunt would be fair disappointed if he knew the truth.


  I'm just fucking on a roll in the club, getting over with so many different people. It's a proper belter of a night. I got off with this bird, she was nothing special, probably a wee bit chubby. For some reason I thought if I got off with her, I'd be more likely to bag her hot friend. Didn't happen, obviously.


  Nice place though. I stayed up until half seven. I set up this drug mule American cunt who was absolutely fucked with a middle-aged Polish bird. I told her he was a corporate lawyer, she totally bought in and they stumbled off into the night as one. Fucking Cupid, me.


  I goes back to the hostel and baby needs peeve. There's a fucking vending machine in the reception that sells Heineken! 2 Euro's a pop. I end sitting up with another bunch of Ozzie's. Fucking monkey see, monkey do; within 20 minutes I've got them saying ""peeve"" and trying to 'too sweet' the hostel employees. A right laugh, at this point I'm a fucking magnet to fanny. I'm giving a masterclass on how to approach birds. Honestly, the wee Ozzie boys are in awe.


  Sits up drinking until 10. Smashed a bottle at reception (accidentally) after telling some birds they had great smiles and that I would proper have a go on them.
Met some solid folk, had a mad one. Successful first night.",01Aug2017,0
34,"**~~Day~~ Night Two: Berlin**


  The fact that I've started dubbing these entries simply as 'night' is an indication of where my energy's being spent.


  Still getting used to this whole idea of Interrailing. Like, what do you actually do? I've spent most of the day times fucking passed out in bed. Been rough. Yesterday, I...I can't even remember much.


  I went to Lidl at some point. Things didn't really get started until that evening. *Ugh, I'm on a comedown. Memory recollection is not great, bare with me.*

   I had a few drinks in the dorm with Simon, the American guy. Nice guy but I reckon he doesn't really like me. Probably thinks I'm a fucking rocket, he wouldn't be wrong either.
He's a good straight guy. Send him in to start conversation with birds. Engineer graduate, quite observant of Political Correctness - he's not threatening to girls. After a while I'll introduce myself, knocking them for six. To be honest though, I've just not been closing very well at all. I'm great at conversation making with them but after a while I get distracted. And I know it's still early days but I thought I'd have certainly shagged by this stage.


  I digress. We're at the hostel bar; me, Simon and three birds. One's a wee ride, the other would get it and there's a fucking mass o' a lass that looks like Dawn French. If Juice Terry taught me anything, it's humour the hefter and you'll stay in the good books of the ridable girls. So I hold my tongue around her.


  Anyway, I'm leading them to Suicide Club again. But fuck me, it's closed. Naturally this distraction leads to me aligning myself with a bunch of Irish chaps and two Slovakian birds. We went on the hunt for clubs. At first I thought I was totally going to baw the wee dark haired one. Nope. Fucking useless.

   Anyway, some wee Swedish cunt starts leading the way and we're on a bus. It's like 4 in the morning. There's a wee girl about 4 or 5 years old that I'm making faces at in the bus hoping the birds lap it up. Who the fuck's got their wee girl on a bus at that time anyway? Public transport is certainly better in this country. It's everywhere.


  Anyway, we get off and keep walking. Must be about half way across Berlin at this point. He's taken us to this fucking ominous warehouse. I latch onto this wee ride and her boyfriend. And we're in. Place is massive.


  *I'm skipping a few hours here 'coz I've just remembered this.*
I'm high as fuck and no word of a lie I have a totally In Bruges moment. I'm speaking to two midgets in a dingy back stair case. They're talking about taking smack. Holy fuck. They were actually midgets. I'd bumped a pill of some boy, First pill in well over a year and it was pretty weak actually. Although, my ice cold resolve has melted. Probably for the best that I didn't get anything too strong 'coz I'm feeling it today. I'm shaking like I've got MS or something.


  The night consisted of me patrolling the premises making inane swedgy conversation with folk like we were lifelong mates. Left with this boy, solid enough guy, can't remember his name. I stumbled roughly in the direction of home with a gradually warming bottle of Desperado's that I'd dropped onion into.


  It took me a good hour to get home. I just followed the Berlin Wall. Eye's rolling into the back of my head cursing the lack of available maps. Came out to this wee river bitty with a floating hotel, where in full comedown mode I contemplated swimming with the fish. Had to have a word with myself, and then moved on. Actually ended up passing it again later on, or earlier today I guess, when I went to find out when and where to go to get to Munich. Lots of people gravitating to the spot. Funny I had it all to myself earlier that morning. Fucking douchey sheep-like hipsters, find the spot yourself.


  Aye, so I followed the Berlin Wall back to the Hostel, crashed out soon after. Feeling it today. Thinking about a quiet one. I've eaten nothing but kebabs since I got here, might go get something nice for dinner.


**Day Three: Berlin**


  *I'm on the Munich train. It's starting to pick up speed so my handwriting might get kinda messy.*


  Just had one of those Currywurst's. Here's what I don't get. All the Germans eat is fucking carbs, sausages and kebab variations. Why are they not all fat bastards? Like everything in this country comes in deep fried or bread form. And their idea of 'spicy' is quite funny. Spiciest sauce this kebab place has I ask for. The vendor guy's laying it on thick doing the whole eyes watering, ears steaming shtick as him and his pal chuckle. Must have been a rib, it tasted like tomato sauce. Gonna have to try harder.


  Went to this wee Vietnamese joint earlier on, and German menu; I can't speak German and they don't speak English. Hilarity ensues. Just pointed at a random number on the menu. Went for 16, not bad actually. It was like some sort of pork(?) breaded(?)sausage(?) type affair in a wee circle around the circumference of a noodle salad, which was fragrant. *You can tell I'm tired, that description is absolutely nonsense.* But for not being a kebab it was fairly pleasant.


  Tried to have a quiet one. Was looking for some cunt to peeve with. Ozzie birds are nice. They're always friendly and smiley. I was spraffing off with this bird in the lobby, Yvette. Shite name but an absolutely unreal girl. I don't think I've fallen in love quicker. Legit, I would happily commit to spending my life with this girl, right now! She's beautiful, got an amazing figure, faultless features (dark hair and eyes, soft as fuck skin and a godly smile). Never seen a better smile, honestly. She could make herself sneeze which for some reason wasn't as retarded as it sounds and was actually adorable.


  Thinking back on this, I feel like James Blunt on the subway. To be fair though, I at least had contact with the bird unlike that pervy Blunt. See when I found out she had a boyfriend, I felt physically sick. Or maybe that was the peeve talking.


   Some absolute belter of an Irish boy burst into the lobby, which I've turned into my personal clubhouse, and gave me an unopened bottle of red wine and this other weird bottled red shite. Not a fan of the latter at all. Turns out they didn't actually belong to him. Awkward when his pal come looking for them a wee while later.


  Ends up going up to their room. There's five of them. Some right weird cunts. One of them jumps on a bed and it breaks. Two of them claim to be DJ's and one of the disk jockeys is adamant that I'm holding back gear from him. Even if I had any, this belter wouldn't be getting any. Needs to lay off the gear if anything, he's real twitchy. The guy who was distributing free alcohol an hour or so before turns heel and goes into a coke-fuelled rage. Me, the DJ and the guy who invited me up leave for pastures new. The DJ's slabbering about his disdain for Jackmaster and is giving me shifty looks as if just coz we're both Scottish I'm in cahoots with the cunt.


  It's clear these guys are a bit higher up the totem pole of being fucked. I can't be this odd when peeved, can I? Anyway, I'm knocking back the wine and this toxic 15% liquor (the red one) and then it happens. The worst/most embarrassing drug deal I've ever witnessed.


  Naturally the DJ wants more coke. There's this creepy wee Asian guy in a pedestrian tunnel just outside the hostel. The Irish guys try to barter out a price while the Asian guy's giving it the ""my friend, €80 is a good price"". Me and this proper ugly German cunt, who appears to be the dealer's enforcer, watch on making small talk. He's not a big guy at all so chances are he's concealing a knife....or worse. I'm thankful for the bottle of red liquor shite for the first time 'coz if this cunt pulls a chib he's getting it right off his skull. Not even sure I'd have bothered to join the Irish in a potential scrap. The DJ is just as likely a candidate to take a bottle across his head. Annoying cunt.


  So the dealer runs away to get his supplies. Fuck knows what he supplied them with, but it wasn't coke. One of the guy's reckons it's novacane. It's weirdly yellow. Was not hard to decline a line.


  Only way you're getting me to do novacane is if it's with Yvette. She's a dental nurse by the way. ♫She wanna be a dentist really bad♫


  Aye so we go to get food. (I'm kayfabing that I have no money 'coz I didn't want any part of the drug deal and I've got to keep up the act.) Right so here's what I reckon has happened. One of them asks for a burger not knowing his pal has ordered two, one for each of them. Communication breakdown. The lad that's alright is eating his burger as the DJ is presented with two, Naturally, an argument ensues. A lot of ""my friend, my friend"" from the kebab guy but the Irish aren't backing down. It's getting quite heated, I reckon someone's gonna get hit.


  See, now I'm in a dilemma. I kinda wanted a burger at this point and I could have paid for the extra burger and probably enjoyed it. However, if I'd shown that I had money the Irish would know I've been lying to them and they're already of the impression that I'm holding back drugs. I let it go.


  The argument continues when the DJ grabs his friend's burger out of his hands in a moment of ""novacane"" fuelled madness and hurls it at the kebab guy. I don't know if it was the visual of the splattered burger or that the DJ decided to use the only actual accounted for burger as his projectile but I popped big.


  All the way back up the road his pal was not happy. He's telling the DJ he was really enjoying the burger which, in his opinion, was delicious. I was glad to see the back of these idiots when the night was through.",01Aug2017,0

36,"In life, some people are born with privilege. For example, cisgender, white males enjoy elevated statuses in society. However, other groups of people -- such as Muslims and transgender people -- do not enjoy the same privilege. As marginalized groups of people, Muslims and transgender people face many day-to-day struggles. Therefore, as citizens, it is important to understand these struggles, and help to minimize them.

One marginalized group is Muslims, who unquestionably face countless day-to-day struggles and hurdles. According to the [HuffPost,](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/husna-ibrahim/the-struggles-of-being-bl_b_11369988.html) the media inaccurately portrays Muslims as criminals. Sadly, this perception often leads to Muslims being called ""terrorists"" while walking down the street. Instead of generalizing Muslims as terrorists, people should take the time to learn more about the faith and its teachings, which promote peace, love, and tolerance. By understanding Islam, and getting to know Muslims, one will learn that Muslims are kind-hearted, everyday people like us.

Another marginalized group is transgender people. Like Muslims, transgender people face many unique challenges and struggles. For one, according to [TransEquality.org,](http://www.transequality.org/issues/youth-students) three-fourths of transgender children feel unsafe at school. Also, 59% of trans youth have been denied access to a restroom that coincides with their gender identity. Therefore, it is important for citizens to understand the struggles and difficulties of transgender youth and adults. By understanding the unique journey of transgender people, folks will gain a newfound respect for these people, and can contribute to safe environments in which trans people can play, live, and work.

Overall, it is clear that marginalized groups of people face unique challenges. As members of the majority groups, it is important to respect minorities, and understand them as people. By doing this, one can help to alleviate some of the struggles they face on a day-to-day basis, and help to brighten their world.",01Aug2017,3

40,"For instance, my uncle thinks that because I, someone who has her life together and treats others with kindness and respect, dated a guy who was irresponsible and unkind, that my value as a person has decreased and that I'm just as low as my ex now. I strongly disagree with this - being with my ex didn't turn me into someone like him, and in fact my character grew stronger and for the better throughout it. I don't think that my value as a person should be determined by one person that I, at one point in my life, chose to spend time with. 

Also, what about being romantically interested in someone and and moving along in the getting to know each other/dating phase at your own pace? My aunt (extended family is old-fashioned) thinks that spending a weekend together, intimate or not, is too much and too quick for two people who have only been talking for a couple of months. I personally think it depends on the connection and how close two people are, but I can understand why she thinks it's too quick. However, again, I don't believe my self-worth or my value as a person is dependent on how quickly I connect with someone. I've met many people and having a fast and deep connection is so rare for me, and I can probably count two times that it's happened and neither times have led to any mistakes or regrets.

44,"You lied to me for three years. You kept so many things from me, you lied to me about so many things. The last time we talked in person you admitted to keeping a lot of things about our sexlife from me. You admitted to lying about parts of our relationship. The last message you sent to me was basically a list of things you had been resenting about me that I had no idea about. I was completely blindsided because of your lack of communication. If you would've talked to me about it maybe we could've worked on it, maybe we couldn't have, either way it doesn't matter now.

You wanted to know what I was doing on pof? I reopened that account the night you broke up with me. I talked to a couple of people at first but things seemed to be improving with us and I stopped. I kept using it, looking at new people whenever you would become unexplainedly distant. But I stopped messaging people, because I wanted to keep you in my life as long as I could.

And how dare you bitch at me for my emotions. Excuse me for being sad when I found out you'd been lying for years. I cried a lot because of you over the years and you act like I was some kind of robot the entire time. I'm sorry I don't have a breakdown every time a dog pisses on the floor, or cry about how the world hates only me when my glasses break.

Which brings me to my next point, how I ""never gave you advice."" I gave you so much goddamn advice over the years. Most of the time you just said it was too hard, you couldn't do it, and you gave up. Like you gave up on everything. So I stopped giving you advice when you made it clear that literally everything was too hard for you to do. I would just quietly listen and consider what you were saying. Like I've told you before, it takes me time to process my emotions, sorry I couldn't give you instant gratification or be the father figure you wanted.

You know why it takes me time to process my emotions? So I don't blow up like you do all the time, or like I did in that message I was complaining about not having anyone. But I never get to be angry or emotional, for the millions of times you've blown up at me and been hurtful, and I wasn't allowed to do the same to you ever. I was mad about you finding someone, but that feeling of jealousy passed. I don't care who you're fucking or what you do with your life, it's your life you can do whatever you want. Now I'm just mad that you poisoned our relationship with your lies. 

Because we could've been friends. You were my best friend, and the only person I had to talk to. Now I spend four days a week completely alone and have no one to talk to, no one messages me, I have no plans with anyone. But as much as I miss having someone to talk to, I don't miss you. You lied about so many aspects of our relationship I no longer believe anything that you ever said to me. Not one thing. As far as I'm concerned every word that ever came out of your mouth was a lie. I don't even know who you are, and I'll never trust you again. And I honestly hope you overreacted and threw away every gift I ever gave you, just like last time. You don't deserve any of it.

As far as I'm concerned, you lied to me for years and pretended to be someone you weren't. You made me think that you were my friend, that you loved me, but you were just faking it for your own selfish reasons. Isn't that exactly what you were always complaining Ashley H did to you?

45,"So, today I volunteered to help a religious organization in the state of Texas lobby to defeat HB 46, aka The Bathroom Bill. I was feeling super great about performing my civic duty, meeting the most wonderful Representatives, their aides, Senators and other wonderful people in the state capitol of Austin and then at the very end I had the most disturbing conversation with a man I believe to be Muslim. I was offended by his general attitude of contempt.  Many have observed that there is a weird dynamic with followers of Islam, where they desire freedom for themselves but seem determined that some other group that is not them should be oppressed. I also don't approve of their lack of fight. My Muslim coworker who has lived in America for a decade was ready to flee to Europe a month ago, which when he told me made no sense to me. 

So, the thing that upset me the most was his strangely superficial interpretation of American principles and of American people [I am not saying this to suggest he was not a natural born American- I do not know that].  He suggested that white American people were running in terror of a hijab wearing woman just because. I thought to myself after the conversation why don't Muslims ever address their religions' dark side. No one cares about hijabs, but, I care about women being invisible in their society, or not being allowed to participate or being killed over the most inconsequential of behaviors. I don't think a girl should be stoned to death for not marrying some half dead douchebag. It also grated on my nerves when he started dumping on Christian, White ""middle Americans.""  For the record, I corrected him real quick. I have a zero tolerance policy for race b.s. regardless of who's mouth it comes out of.  His whole tone and attitude changed so fast, suddenly he didn't want to talk to me anymore.

So, naturally I was pissed that he would assume I hated white people and would participate in such race bashing. Plus, he spoke to me as if Muslims had stood on the line with Martin Luther King Jr. himself and took his bullet. In my recollection, Muslims generally hate black people and have always felt superior to them.  That was the premise of the movie Towelhead, for example. (Lebanonese father, marries white female, has to take care of his daughter and freaks out when she gets a black boyfriend- he thinks he's better, because who the hell knows.)  I have had exactly one good experience with a Muslim man irl and many that suggests they are just take the money and run types who have no interest in contributing to American progression. I have never really taken this position in my life, because generally I think everything on this earth is here for reason and everyone has an equal right to their shot but I think we should stop all this Muslim adoration and giving these guys passes like we're doing. They really have never stood on the line in this country in any way and still are not. I think Islam is a dead religion. One step away from being mythology. The basis of the religion seems to be rote memorization of stories that does not allow for adaptation of interpretation. It's a religion that literally expected humans to live exactly how they were at its inception and that's just bananas. Say what you want about the violence and weirdness of The Bible, but The New Testament is a living thing. It's so alive, we're still waiting for the Second Coming, that's right, sometime and somewhere there's going to be a third act, there's nothing comparable in Islam. All they have to look forward to is death.  I think that's why there is so much plague, violence, cruelty and evil in majority Muslim countries. I think the Muslims here need to start being held to the fire on getting in line with our American ideals or they need to go. Trump may be right on this one. I think we are being infiltrated. I think we might be in a holy war. I can not support anyone who would casually try to induce me to make war against my fellow American regardless of race. I would not let my black or white friends wrongfully disrespect Muslims but I will not stand for Muslims to try to play us against each other. Muslims are not cute little puppy dogs, they're human beings. Be careful about getting so excited to be inclusive with a community that has long been closed to the rest of us and has never fought for ANY of us. They seem to be piggybacking on our various idiosyncrasies to win a cold war against us. Muslims need to start acting American or GTFO. Wearing a hijab in 2017 does not make you a Civil Rights superstar, so stop it. True Americans do not hate, so stop it. Fight your battles or step. ",01Aug2017,0

47,"Hi Reddit,

I don't post very frequently but I thought I'd make a self post regarding North Korea as someone who grew up in South Korea.

I've noticed that there are a lot of articles lately discussing how NK's missiles are capable of hitting US states now. These threads usually devolve into arguments about how Japan must be getting antsy or how Seoul is (or is not) at risk of artillery shelling or chemical attacks. Not to mention, how China love-hates North Korea.

Before we get into any war scenarios, I want to make this point:

Even if we agree that North Korea has the ability to attack America, we must ask the more important question of whether they have a REASON to attack America or her allies. 

If NK was more powerful than America, maybe they'd attack us. But they're not. Not by a long shot. You know that. All that rhetoric of engulfing America in a sea of flames is FOR THEIR OWN PEOPLE - who by the way are increasingly ignoring the propaganda themselves. South Koreans and North Korean defectors are waging a cultural war in North Korea by sending in USB drives full of KPOP and KDRAMAS and KFILMS. If you want internal change, that's how you do it. You have to subvert the propaganda with proof of wealth on the outside, not meet it head on by upping our own militant rhetoric. That's playing into their own game!

If we as the public and you Media folks fail to parse out the fact that NK gov't prefers the status quo, we will only bring fear and greater uncertainty to the American public because we will continue to read headlines about NK's capabilities without factoring in their reasoning.

Import side note: calling Kim Jong Un ""crazy"" or ""unstable"" doesn't do us any good because it shifts our perspective of him. We need to interpret his actions carefully, not dismiss them arrogantly. Every  move he has made, from gaining weight so that he looks more like his revered grandfather to killing his China-backed brother, Kim Jong Un's actions are carefully considered to ensure his regime's preservation.

In the face of these facts we need to ask ourselves this simple question: Would he have anything to gain by attacking America or her allies with a nuclear strike?

If you've been paying attention the answer should be a resounding no. The second NK strikes first, they lose any and all moral authority as the aggressor and they leave themselves open to merciless retaliation and a sure end to the Kim dynasty.

The opposite would be true if the US were to attack. The second America strikes first, China and Russia would point an accusatory finger at us for disrupting the status quo in a region that has seen stability and growth for decades now. South Korea, should it not give consent will feel betrayed by her most important ally for going behind her back. You folks chiming in every so often saying it's ""time to do something"" without understanding any of this are only making the situation WORSE. You're giving journos clicks for inflammatory headlines. You're giving writers a reason to make that headline more scary and you're feeding the bias that comes from misunderstanding.

Believe me I'm no fan of the current administration but even Trump knows this. It's why he hasn't attacked. It's why he's been trying to pressure China. You don't think he'd have done something by now if he could when he's losing face over the NK issue?

China has been happily advancing its society for the last few decades and anything to hinder this progress will be stopped with great prejudice. As such a war in Korea would throw the world's economy into chaos. You're advocating a conflict between China, the US, Korea, and Japan and you don't think that's gonna be the case?

South Korea is not only a major trading partner, investor, and employer in America, it is now a regional power in Asia that should be given full consideration before any action is taken and as far as I can tell articles and comment threads don't give much attention to the South Korean perspective. 

America and her Allies have aligned interests. If you go America first at the sake of an ally's wishes, you're going to lose whatever faith our other allies have in us. It's why our guarantee of retaliation is so powerful. If we didn't retaliate against a NK strike on our allies, our guarantee of security to other allies will crumble. 

Sen. Lindsey Graham seems to think America wouldn't suffer in case of a war in Korea. Let me assure you if there is war American jobs will be lost (those employed by Korean companies), American lives will be lost (servicemen and civilians in Korea), and America may well lose favor among East Asian nations if the war gets out of hand and the repercussions echo throughout the region. That is to say, refugees from South Korea will flee to Japan. North Koreans will flee to China.

And you think Syria is bad?

A NK nuclear strike on America or her allies is out of the question. NK will not strike first with nuclear arms unless we corner them. You know what they say about cornering prey right? It's the dumbest thing you can do because they will go all out when there is nothing to lose. Always leave room to escape (de-escalate).

By getting suckered into the media narrative of a greater chance of war, our countries inch closer to war because of the increased fear among the public. Fear blinds us and when fear is founded on incomplete information, we make poor choices on top of being blinded.

We have missile defense systems in America and Japan. We are not without recourse there and therefore the threat is not really there. The threat is to South Korea who is a bit too close for most systems to be effective as I understand especially in an artillery barrage scenario. This is why the THAAD is so controversial. It's nice to have, but unnecessary considering the other threats it won't deter (artillery) and the political fallout it leads to (China retaliating economically against South Korea). Not to mention, South Korea already possesses America's retaliation as a deterrent to a nuclear strike as covered above.

It is true that North Korea is growing in capability and there are valid fears that even if NK never attacks, they could still sell their nuclear technology. To this I say increase monitoring and disincentivize those countries or entities who would seek to buy. I hear the Iran deal is working out alright so far.

Nuclear technology will spread throughout the world as a matter of time just as gunpowder weapons did. It will be impossible to stop the proliferation of information but what we can do is deter the USE of this information by not pushing each other into corners. What we should do instead is invest heavily in defensive technology to preemptively castrate any possible threats by proliferating wealth and trade relationships with ""problem"" countries. 

We also need to remember though that the Korean war was a proxy war between Stalinist forces and US forces in the aftermath of World War 2. Instead of dividing up Japan like we did Germany after the war, we divided up Korea who had been suffering from Japanese exploitation for 30+ years all because Korea is located in a more strategically significant location (next to China). We must therefore understand that NK's increased nuclear capabilities are also an extension of modern Russian and US relations. The two will avoid a direct confrontation but wherever they can they will try to top each other (see Ukraine, Syria, now North Korea). 

If NK starts rampaging through Asia, sure let's wipe them out. But NK has yet to invade a country since ceasefire in 1953 (save for a brief stint with the NVA, which SK was on the other side of). Skirmishes have occurred, but neither side wants it to escalate any further. 

To close, I want to emphasize the importance of building the relationship between the USA and SK, USA and China, and China and SK. The stronger these relationships are (read: better informed) the even less likely NK will dare to step out of line. China won't stop feeding NK behind the scenes so if the other relationships listed get complicated, we will have lost the long term war as China gets stronger by virtue of population and NK climbs out of poverty in the long run via the feeding tube.So long as America can align its desires for the status quo (as with China) by building up relationships with Countries around NK, we will continue to prevent war as we have the last 70 years.

Mr. President, please feel free to ignore the NK threat as there is none in the face of America's overwhelming advantage in every respect. America, don't entertain the idea of striking preemptively and you won't give China and Russia any political ammo to shoot at us. If NK goes postal on SK then yeah let loose the hounds of war but till then rest easy as we have countermeasures in place already.

TLDR: If America wants peace it has one option. Better journalism. Stop talking about what NK is capable of and start talking about what NK wants: the status quo. Also include what WE are capable of in defensive terms. Should the bald eagle bat its eyes when the bunny bares its teeth?",01Aug2017,20
50,"We were having trouble with our front door lock/knob. Our house keys were getting stuck and it was difficult to get the key into the knob/lock. The total cost of this experience was $390. My wife and I feel we've been overcharged. My wife contacted locksmith-pros.net and we both profoundly regret having engaged them. My wife has spent multiple hours on the phone trying to get anyone to get the tech who came out to keep an appointment. 
The level of customer service we have experienced is appalling, and doing a Google search of locksmith-pros.net brings up fraud reporting in the first couple of hits. 
The original tech has now yelled, YELLED at my wife about three times, we were told we could get a partial refund, but only one person she spoke with was authorized to do that and he was supposed to come tonight, August 1st. We were supposed to have someone come out Friday night, last night and again tonight and we've been blown off all three times. Now while on hold, she's been passed around multiple times, hung up on multiple times. As someone who provides customer service for a living, I would be fired SOOOOOO fast if behaved like this.",01Aug2017,4
