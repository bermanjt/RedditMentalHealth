0,"And I don't want to go see my ""friends"".  I only see them a few times a year, and they aren't exciting to be around. 

 One of them is having a birthday tonight.  I really don't wanna go.  I'd rather just cut off communication with them entirely.  I really never have meaningful conversations with them. 

 I don't know if I should tell them I can't make it for the next for months until I lose weight or if I should just stop talking to them entirely.

The thing is, I don't have anything else even remotely close to friends other than those people.",17Dec2017,1
3,I have a fever since yesterday. I felt the first symptoms in the afternoon. I was cold even though it was actually warm. (I live in Miami). I took some medicines and this is when I started to feel hot. I went to sleep and in the middle of the night around 2 Am I suddenly woke up and my heart was pounding and for no apparent reasons I felt fear. Like something bad was really about to happen. Was someone watching me or was it just panic attack? I never had panic attacks before so I'm not really sure. ,17Dec2017,2

9,"Being in college is terrible when you're a loser. I get to see all these attractive people having the time of their lives while I spend every day alone and miserable. Everybody is cultivating wonderful experiences they'll remember for the rest of their lives, filled with friends, lovers, parties, etc. Meanwhile the most fun I can have is smoking so much weed that I forget who I am.

I know it's my fault. But, I don't think I can change. I just can't connect to people and, to be honest, I don't really enjoy talking to them. It's ironic that the only things I really want are friends &amp; a girlfriend. Alas, my personality is too nonexistent to have anyone be interested in me. I'm ugly too, so I can't even get in with shallow people lol. It's honestly pretty selfish that I want friends, let alone a girlfriend. I have nothing to offer and I can't see that changing.

I don't even know why I'm in college aside from it being what you're ""supposed"" to do. If my life goes on like this and I end up working some shitty job every day to come home to no one, I'll just kill myself.

15,I’m good at nothing really and it’s making me depressed. ,17Dec2017,1
16,"I just decided I’d write this story down and perhaps it would help me, if only to get one nights sleep.
I’m 29 years old, I’m turning 30 in just over a month... I had a terrible childhood with severe trauma and the whole baggage that entails into adult life. After years of depression and self loathing and failed relationships and broken friendships I got myself in much necessary therapy, got diagnosed with a severe personality disorder, did my homework and decided to put all my energy into healing and self growth. With a few bumps in the way I did achieve some form of inner peace, awareness, better coping skills. 
I’m in a good place.
Over the last 11 years I’ve had one true friend. One ride or die best fucking friend. Partner in crime. She’s a sister, a family, a Roomate and a partner. She’s shown me unconditional patience and empathy, she’s been there with me through thick and thin. A platonic soul mate.
I moved away from our hometown about 1.5 years ago to solidify a romantic relationship. Even then our friendship was proven. She needed me.
Like I’ve needed her so much in the past she went through the most insane life events and I was glad to be able to be there for her.
It all started in Janurary, i woke up from a dream and had the weird premonition that she was pregnant. She announced it to me before anyone. She had met the man of her dreams and was so happy. Everything she had wished for was coming true. I felt immediately supportive, I wanted her close to me so I could help through her pregnancy. Her boyfriend mentioned that he was getting several job offers in my area with competitive salaries so I insisted they move in with me until they could get on their feet and afford their own appartement. 
I gave them my one bedroom condo to crash in and slept over at my boyfriends most of the time. Her boyfriend worked long hours and her and I kept each other company. 
They started to look for an appartment so that she could start nesting and prepare for their baby’s arrival. She and I trusted her boyfriend with the process. Everything seemed to get complicated as they wer constantly being jerked around by potential landlords. Then things took a turn for the worst. A routine ultrasound revealed that her baby may have a developmental issue. We spent months going from doctor to doctor only to end up losing her baby and having to deliver him still born midway through her 3rd trimester. At that point I watched my best friend go through the most heart wrenching depression and decided she couldn’t be alone. My boyfriend bought a house to replace his current one and we decided to rent them the basement appartment at a really low fee. They moved from my condo to there and slowly she was starting to feel better. Her boyfriend worked crazy hours but they had big plans to start trying for a second baby, get a place of their own,...
It’s now been a year since they moved in with me in the first place. 
2 months ago I discovered that 11 000$ was stolen from my personal safe. I have been a wreck since. I went to the police, hired a detective, installed security cameras and held a throughout investigation. 
I confronted my only possible culprit, her boyfriend. He swore he never took the money although he was the ONLY one with access to it. Then shit started piling up. He started disappearing, he couldn’t pay the tiny rent we asked, he said he got fired but never came home at night. My best friend continued to believe in his innocence and told me he agreed to take a lie detector test. I scheduled one. He kept promising her he’d take it for a month and the morning of the appointment he didn’t show up and basically vanished. Other things went missing in the process. I don’t even know wtf I feel anymore. One one hand I am betrayed to the core. I did everything for them. On the other hand my best friend is completely broken now. She lost everything this year. Her man, her baby. I’m raging for her and myself. She’s blaming herself. I’m consoling her... I don’t even know what I want to do with all this. I want my money back, or someone to pay for this crime, this betrayal, I want to avenge her too. I don’t sleep. I’m a wreck.

19,"I am a young man with self-control, i do stuffs that young people do, i have conflicts with my mom, i sometimes lie a lot. I have matured a lot since the day i went to high-school that i have a life and career ahead of me, so i tried my best to improve myself, to ensure that i’ll formed a steady basis when i’ve grown up. But there’s always this asshole, this pain in the ass, let’s call him T.

T has enormous ego, so much that he can almost be a narcissist himself. He always shout at me, insult me, de-elevate me. He called me a pig, a dog, a shame. He always joke cruel jokes that ain’t funny but offending. T always thinks that his idea and way of thinking is the best and try to assimilate me from back when i was a young child.

This morning he did what he always does again, and i ignored him. Did i do anything wrong? What should i have done?",17Dec2017,2
20,"I feel like such a loser. I’ve been trying so hard to make friends in college and it hasn’t been working. I think that I’m funny, and nice to talk to but I know I’m pretty socially awkward. On top of that I’ve been depressed for months. I attempted suicide in high school and obviously it wasn’t successful since I’m posting this now. I smoke weed to help my anxiety and it helps with my depression a bit. I used to take lexapro and trazadone but I stopped cold turkey a while ago. I think I may need to go back in meds or see a therapist again. Honestly the only thing stopping me from killing myself is my bf. I don’t want to hurt him and I can’t even imagine how much it would tear him apart. I know if he commit suicide i would be a complete wreck. I’ve told him how sad I feel and how disappointed I am with myself. I know he cares but he just doesn’t seem to know what to say. He doesn’t know I want to kill myself. I wish I could stop feeling like this though. ",17Dec2017,14
21,"I did the supervised IQ test and got 116 on the first one and 137 on the second one. I'm certain I must have guessed a lot of answers right on the second one and the first one is a much truer reflection of my IQ. Perfectly average math ability, absolutely suck at chess when I've been playing it for years, I am retaking this school year (I am 18). So nothing that reflections a 137 IQ or even 127 which is the average of the two. I think 105-115 is correct .. on a good day.


If I join everyone there is going to be too smart for me and I won't be able to engage with any of them properly, as in, I won't be able to play chess with them (for games more than 4 moves in which they checkmate me) or do other activities, I'll just be like an affirmative action type kid if you get me",17Dec2017,1

25,"I am currently in my last year of undergrad in college.  I have a very good GPA, will be doing research for graduation honors, and am in the process of applying to graduate school.  But I cant help but feel inferior to nearly all of my peers, and think that I should be much farther ahead than I am now.

I feel like I've managed to bullshit my way through college.  I know a lot about my field, yes.  But...I dont know.  I just feel like after spending 4 years learning about a subject I should know *a hell of a lot more* than I do. Maybe it's because I'm moving into more complex classes and learning about how fucking much information is out there that I don't know, just in my field alone.

I just want to be smart, you know?  I want to be like my grandfather, who could just rattle off a seemingly unending list of facts and history on a specific subject that I had no idea he was so fluent in.  I want to be able to do that and I just don't know.  I can barely tell you what I'm studying in school and not stutter and put the words together to try and explain.  I'd give anything to just have that much knowledge crammed into my brain. Maybe I should start reading again?  I feel like I could find a few minutes here and there to do that.  It wouldn't hurt. I used to read a lot, and know for a fact that he's read more books in his life than could fit in a small library.

MIL is mostly a loving and kind person, but she also has little glitchy OCD areas that she cannot fucking shut up about (e.g., the baby is cold [the baby is not cold]). This will be one.

So she will be spewing this utter nonsense into my wife's ear for the rest of her life, and because my wife seeks her approval, she'll suspect me slightly, even though she knows it's unreasonable to suspect me at all. It's not a huge deal, but this completely unnecessary garbage has made my life marginally more annoying forever.

I know what he’s gonna say. I know it. “We could get it if you get on my shoulders.”

No, no no no. Sigh. Look around. Odds of getting help are slim. No one around. Housewares is always dead during Christmas time in department stores if you need a chill place, btw.

She heard, she watched,  she was there all those times the cops came to the door to arrest him. I have irrefutable proof of the ongoing abuse I suffered by his hand AND his, now, ex wife. Somehow my sister didn't have to deal with what I had to. She still talks to him and maintains a relationship with him. I've asked her not to mention him around me because I didn't think it would be fair of me to make her choose. Out of nowhere, she starts telling me how much it sucks that she can't discuss their relationship with me. She's actually upset with me and says she was hoping I would ""choose her over love or hate towards him."" I don't get where she's trying to go with that and I can't believe she thinks her actions are acceptable.  I don't want to think about what he did or how fucked up I was for years after because of it all. It's devastating knowing she doesn't care one bit about making me re-live that nightmare.

Somebody joined with the username rd and started saying that his life was hopeless and that he was suicidal, because he felt he might be transgender but didn't want to be. Everyone immediately started telling him ""oh yes you must be transgender, just embrace those feelings and you'll be happier."" It was horrifying to watch this young man ask for help and immediately be told there is only one way he can feel and that any dissention from that is just him hiding his true nature. So he lashed out, started calling trans people disgusting and such. It was hurtful stuff but it didn't feel genuine, because I don't think it was; it was just a reaction to what I'm sure must have felt like an attempt to have a point of view forced upon you. But people just couldn't realise that and he got banned for it. We turned our backs on someone that asked for our help and the only advice we gave was ""you're definitely trans"". It sickens me, and honestly it makes me want to leave because it was so toxic.
