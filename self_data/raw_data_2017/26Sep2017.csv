0,"I just snapped at my roommate because she and her friend were making too much noise talking, watching tv at 3 am. And I had to wake up at fucking 7 am for class. I told them to turn it down but she told me it was a one time thing and I should tolerate it but no I yelled at their face and now I feel like an asshole. I just wanted to sleep and I was pissed off. I keep questioning myself bc I think I have anger issues that sometimes I can’t control it and snap at people. It has become a personal issue because most people around me think I’m cold and distant. Everyone blames me and my anger issues for everything. I hate them when they do it because they’re not fucking innocent and no I won’t be blamed. Is it wrong that sometimes I just don’t wanna be around people and just want to be left alone? Why call me “problematic” because I’m not like you?",26Sep2017,1

8,"I don’t know if this is the right subreddit to post this, but I am just looking for some advice. The title explains most of my problem here, but yeah I am 19 years old and my dad unexpectedly passed away in November 2016 from a heart attack. 

My dad was amazing and he was so intelligent and I admired him so much. He was such a huge part of my life. He truly helped shape me into the person I am, he was a very philosophical man and thought deeply about everything. He introduced me to so much music, movies, and books. I can never put into words how much I loved him and how much he meant to me. He was always so proud of everything I did, and put so much importance to even the smallest things I did. He was an amazing father, so proud of each one of us. He cared about his family with his entirety being, and was the backbone to our family. I hate to think of the future without him.  

Whenever I think of how I won’t ever see him again I really feel my heart break. I immediately have to stop that thought which isn’t healthy because I know I need to face this fact in order to continue a healthy/happy life. I can’t face this fact because I just don’t want it to be true, and I am so mad that he was taken away from me and I didn’t get a chance to say goodbye. I really don’t know how to deal with this feeling because my siblings are all in the same boat as me, feeling absolutely saddened by this thought. When I talk to my friends I get the same thing over again, and don’t get me wrong I am so grateful for their support but it doesn’t exactly help me because they just don’t have a clue what I am going through. 

Tonight has been especially hard for me and I just want to hear some advice people have. I just feel so crushed and want my dad back because he would have the best advice for me, but if he was here then this wouldn’t be a problem.

10,"I didn't know what subreddit to tell this in but I think this will do. ( 21M) It's late where I live and I was reminiscing about an experience that had happened to me a couple of months ago in the summer and I thought I would share it (it's not that long). I don't know how interesting you guys will think it is but maybe it could help someone and make someone feel good. We had just gotten back from overseas and we were at an airport waiting to go home back to our city. It ends up getting cancelled. There was another flight late at night to Philly and we arrived there at 2 am in the morning. We still had to wait 6 hours till our flight back to our home city. It was my mom, siblings and I. We walk to our terminal and just wait at the gates. My family decides to sleep at the gate and I decide to do some exploring at the philly airport. It's like 3 am and like nobody is there. It's so quiet and eerie but at the same time very relaxing. Now a quick side story. I came back from a middle eastern country with my heartbroken. The girl I wanted to marry rejected me. She was my first love and it crushed me (I'm doing better now thank god) So this was a good walk to clear my mind and think. Anyways as I am walking back to my gate I spot an older gentleman sitting alone and I don't feel like going back to my gate just yet as I still had like 4 hours till my plane leaves and I'm not even tired tbh. I go to the gentleman and ask him when the workers start coming and he tells me that he doesn't know. So I started talking to him more and asking where he is going and he told me he was going to Connecticut as he just found out his mother died. I told him I was sorry and I offered my prayers and condolences. He thanked me and then asked me where I'm headed and where I was. I'm starting to become comfortable with the guy and I sit next to him and tell him I came back from visiting family in a middle eastern country. And he's like ""that's really neat son"". And then idk why but I really wanted to let it out and then I told him that the girl I wanted to marry me denied me and that I loved her so much. I apologized a lot as I said how weird this must be. Telling a stranger that I've known for like 15 minutes a really personal thing. He just laughed and said to me ""kid don't apologize. I'm glad you told me and it seemed like you just wanted to talk to someone"". I'm holding back tears ngl. I never really got to talk to anyone about it and I really needed to let it out. I finally said ""any tips?"". And he goes on about how he's way older then me and he just gave me some really good advice. I don't want to get to much into it as it will be long but the last thing he said to me before I left to go to my gate was (and I'll never forget it) ""Listen son I'm 55 years old. You're 21. Trust me when I tell you this. Don't get hung up on this. You are so young and you don't even know it. You will have more chances at love and you will experience more heartbreak. You might not know it now but this may have been a good thing for you. Just hang in there and trust me when I say that 10 years from now you won't even be thinking about her."" I smiled and I said ""thank you sir. You don't understand how much this means to me. I'm so sorry about your mom but thank you for being at an airport at 4 am in the morning."" He laughed and wished me luck and told me to stop worrying so much. I shook his hand and we said our goodbyes. I was walking back to my gate and I was crying. That was just so refreshing to hear and I didn't expect it to be in a situation like this. I was kind of tired and pissed my flight was cancelled but that man really helped me out. Idk why I'm telling you guys this but I really hope you get something out of it because I sure did.",26Sep2017,8
11,"My bf is very attractive and it’s been hard for me ever since we started dating. Literally in the halls at school girls would just laugh at me/give dirty looks when i was with him because they thought he was too good for me. It was pretty obvious so it’s not like I’m making this up in my head. 

Think of the one guy “every” girl had a crush on at some point/thought was attractive at your high school, that’s my boyfriend. In college how i’m treated when i’m with him isn’t as bad. It’s more of dirty looks and acting like i’m not there.

So many girls would flirt with him in school,grab is butt, all this aggressive stuff a guy would get hell for doing so when we started dating obviously they hated me/tried to act like i don’t exist. Whenever I do things with him I just see people treat him different (better) because they find him attractive.

This usually doesn’t bother me bc i’m secure in my relationship and know my bf is only interested in me. But it just annoys me when people do things right in front of my face that shows an attraction to my bf. I’m just focusing on it so hard right now and needed to vent

12,"This is the chronicle of my worst flight ever, I am still confused about what happened. I am writing it here in the hope that you might help me find peace.
Three days ago, I was on a flight back from Europe to San Francisco. I would like to not disclose the airline name so I will not write the city of origin and the main language spoken in the cabin. I speak 4 other European languages but not this one.
I sit first in my aisle seat (15H) and then another passenger arrives, a lady with cat (LWC) which carries a bag with a cat inside. LWC has the middle seat. Third passenger arrives, another lady (LNC, lady no cat), which has the window seat but cannot seat next to windows. So LWC moves to window (very kind of her) and let the lady without cat sit in the middle.
Cat allows the two ladies to start conversation immediately. I tend to isolate myself in my movie world thanks to my noise cancelling headphones. But in the few moments before I can prepare my audio/video setup the ladies already went through a very strange dialogue. 
In short, LWC explains she is American and leaving the country because of lack of money/work permit and she is losing everything and everyone she likes including boyfriend and she is going back to nothing because she has no place to go. And she cries while telling this.
And LNC tries to be supportive. LWC is young and her face communicates in a great way all her pain. LNC is nice woman but older and might feel like a mother to the sad LWC.
But I was impressed by the almost unbelievable list of sad events/coincidences I heard.

Now cat episode number 1. LWC wants the cat to be under meds during flight to make him feel more relaxed. She needs to put a small pill down cat's throat. Cat is not happy to see her. Cats reacts badly to her opening of the small window in the bag and tries to fight. She succeeds but her nail is destroyed, cat bite it hard. She is bleeding. LWC says is nothing that we shall not call assistance. LNC offers wipes and band aid. Problem almost solved. But LWC was crying even more. I was shocked to see LWC did not prepare some food for hiding the pills and suffered so much for such a trivial task.

Cat episode number 2. LWC goes to the restroom with cat (maybe needed to be changed, but it wasn't smelly). She comes back after long time and looks devastated. LNC asks what's wrong and LWC (while crying) explains that she lost a gold bracelet in the toilet. That she looked everywhere, she emptied the whole trash bag but she could not find it. That it was a very important souvenir. LNC always trying to support and cuddle.

Cat friends. Cat and LWC attract interest from neighbors. People come to visit and say hello. Not all people, only old ladies that look like crazy cat ladies. Very overweight. My view of my screen is impaired by the visits but that's OK. I hit pause and wait a little bit.

Cat episode number 3. I don't know exactly how it happened but the cat was out of its bag. Maybe LWC thought he was stressed and wanted to touch it. I really don't know. What I found interesting is that the poor cat always treated her like they were strangers.... but this might be normal with cats. I am more a dog person. Anyway cat out, very loud noises and screams from both cat and LWC. She tries to keep him in her hands to avoid him running through the plane. Cat reacts badly. People jumps up and surround my seat (I am aisle), some brings the cover to try to catch it. I was feeling in danger because I was in the possible escape route of the cat. Too crowded around me so I released my seatbelt and went away. Somehow, they managed to capture the cat. LWC was bleeding profusely from both her arms and hands. And really desperate and crying (but now I can understand). One guy seems to go look for help and first aid kit but he is not coming back. I thought maybe I misunderstood (I don’t speak their language) so after a minute I decide to go look for help myself. Flight attendant was talking to guy, she responded badly to me saying that she is busy. I realize she is very stressed because she cannot find first aid kit. Not very professional honestly.

I decide to leave and not come back, I spend time in the tail eating snacks and talking to people.
It seems flight attendants were able to put bandages on the poor LWC.
I meet LNC and she explains to me that FA will sanitize our seats, LWC lost a lot of blood everywhere. Not a single FA talks to me about the accident that happened to my seat nor offer to me a different seat.

Cat is segregated into a bathroom and that door will never be opened again during flight.

LWC asks one attendant to look for her bracelet but with no success.

Sadly, I had to go back to my seat where I find LWC sad and crying drinking wine I think. She has her head in her hands on the tray. Last meal is served, I am not very hungry. LNC decides to take also the plate for LWC but there is no room so I share my tray to host third lunch. But it will not be eaten.
When hot beverages arrive, I wanted a tea. Unfortunately, LWC raise her head and I notice blood everywhere on her tray, she might have removed some bandages or hit some of her wounds. I decide I no longer want tea. She takes one. FA passes her the tea without event reacting to the presence of her blood all over the tray.

I am a very calm and zen person, but I care about others. The problem here is that since the beginning I had the feeling that LWC is a sort of black hole of pity and she somehow feeds on people empathy. I could not believe that she was just a regular person in front of unfortunate events. I tried to warn LNC that she might be victim of LWC attitude but her reaction was strange. She told me that she believed LWC was probably a person with issues but still she was very attached to her. She also said to me that she was very sorry many times. This is crazy, she has no fault but she says she is sorry. She clearly identified with LWC.
I realized how traumatized I was only when toward the end of the flight I played peekaboo with a baby. His smile started to heal me a little bit and I didn’t know it would have felt so good. I really wanted to get out of there but even now, 3 days after, I still think about those moments. I don’t know if I am more shocked about the lack of intervention from the FAs, the fact that LWC has probably a big mental issue but also can manipulate people feelings in a way beyond imaginable, or that pets in cabin are allowed.

13,"i don’t even know if these kinds of posts are allowed here but i suppose we will see. also wasn’t sure to put this here or in r/offmychest so both i guess.
i’m sad. i don’t know why. i have an amazing boyfriend who i love very much and who loves me just the same. my family is wonderful. i’m excelling in all of my courses in university. i have absolutely no reason to be sad. but i am.

lonely too, which is so weird for me to feel that way when i’m surrounded by so much love all the time. i’ve been feeling like this for a while now. i thought maybe i was just in a funk, having a bad day, you know? but then one day turned into a lot of days. days to weeks, and now weeks are turning into months and i don’t really know what to do about it. 

i don’t necessarily want to say i feel depressed because i haven’t been diagnosed (although i haven’t been to a doctor either) and i don’t feel suicidal or anything. i just feel like i’m stuck in a hole. and the harder i try to climb out of it, the deeper it gets. ",26Sep2017,1

17,"SO, I'm in college. I have to see and speak to a lot of women in my day-to-day, I think the male:female ratio where I'm going is something like 1:5 so it's rare that in group work or group discussion that there's a group of all guys let alone that I'm in it. I have no choice to speak to and work with the opposite sex, not that I'm opposed to that. I am a straight male after all. And with that I can transition into the beef of my...thesis I'd guess you'd call this.

I'm a generally accepting and forgiving guy I'd like to think. I get mad easy, but it never takes long for me to bounce back and forgive. I also like to think that I find a relatively wide range of body types/shapes and faces attractive compared to what most men I think realistically look for. I say ""realistically"" because contrary to popular belief men do not find classically ugly women attractive now, and they never will no matter what changes in the times people perceive, there's a reason you don't see mildly attractive men or at least normal looking men dating women who are overweight (be they chubby or obese), have nasty and/or severely crooked teeth, have acne all over their face, have strong or square jaws (because that's a distinctive masculine feature), or who have a saggy body or obvious jelly rolls (that’s the difference between a woman who is naturally thick and a woman who is lazy). That's just a reality that we as a society need to accept; if you aren't attractive outwardly that's unfortunate, and the ""appearances don't determine intelligence"" thing is bullshit, because they kinda do.

I find the nerdy girls(and boys) in high school that we all think of when we talk about the kids who were losers or ugly could be outwardly attractive if they just tried to be or knew how to. The reason the hot chicks in high school were typically not nearly as bright is because their natural appearance tis all they've got going for them (so they dedicate more time to maintaining it and improving it), which was seen as an easy target in primitive societies because stupid, skinny ""skanks"" don't have the strength or ingenuity to resist so they're conditioned by their peers to be submissive as a self preservation tactic, thus the reason hormonal immature teens find them attractive. In high school I saw a lot of friends turn to drugs or dropout and work at fast food places, and some even died with depression caused by their own stupidity. Do you know what a common trend I found occurred among these poor souls who didn’t make it to graduation or quit halfway to become drug dealers or parasites leaching off their parents? They liked or tended to date skinny girls with small tits that smoked, drank, did drugs or were just airheads (saying stupid things in the realm of “I’m bisexual because I like it” first of all, no you’re not, you’re a teenager with raging just now functional ovaries and your hormones are telling you to do and say anything that will make boys around you want you, and you’ve chosen the tactic of trying to being the “freak”, in the grown up world they’re called “sluts”). One of those friends told me “because that's just disgusting, all those stretch marks and it’s just fat you know…” and my response was “Yeah it’s fat, but it’s also tissue, and mammary glands that she’ll use to feed my newly born children if we have them. Big tits produce more milk, my sister-in-law is a perfect example of that; her boobs were huge and then she gave birth and she’s making enough milk to keep the baby fed at all times of the day and still have enough left over to donate to the breast milk bank. And stretch marks? What kind of macromastia/fake-tiddies are you looking at in your free time?” Granted a woman doesn’t NEED to make that much milk, but big tits before pregnancy is a sign that she’ll probably be able to produce enough to keep the baby healthy into toddlerhood.

Ugly, underweight, and overweight women just aren’t attractive that's the harsh reality. And most of the time it’s their own fault for not taking care of themselves, and that type of stupidity is inherited sorry to say. It's not misogynistic, it's biology; men subconsciously are attracted to women with better genes, which are typically associated with the traits we might call classically beautiful. To give you a modern day example, the trend ""thick thighs save lives"" in which men are attracted to women with full and shapely thighs and hips has a basis in science, it's a sign of higher evolution (stronger legs help you run from predators and move with less difficulty during pregnancy). SO I find a lot of women attractive because I generally associate sex appeal with outwardly visible signs of health and a good gene pool. I’m a generally accepting guy. Now I get to my main point. As I said, I meet a lot of attractive women everyday. And more and more of them I see are sporting nose rings. It hurts me mentally (not literally, but you get the idea) when I see this beautiful, well-rounded young woman of at least average intelligence if she isn’t above average wearing this nose ring or other tacky looking facial piercing. Now I have ADHD and a severe case of it (I even have a friend who thinks the vast majority of people who are diagnosed with it don’t actually have it and are undisciplined, and he points to me as a rare example of someone who actually does have it and needs the medication to put my intelligence to use), and I’m easily distracted, but I value meaningful and genuine conversation; I don’t like airheads, they’re boring because most of them are shallow and stupid. I think that eye contact is required for that when talking in person. And I find it an unreasonable expectation in a world where ADHD is on the rise (just look here https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201509/dramatic-rise-in-adhd-diagnoses) that I am to look you in the eyes when you’re wearing this unnatural shiny metal object less than two inches below them. Don’t tell me “hey my eyes are up here” in that scenario; because in that instance you’re the rude and insensitive one, I have ADHD sorry I have an attention problem that I cannot train myself out of. Cleavage (which mind you I am very attracted to, and most of my romantic and sexual fantasies involve my partner’s preferably sizable cleavage) I can deal with, it’s almost a foot below wear I’m trying to keep my attention. But nose rings, and just facial piercings in general make it hard for me to listen to what you have to say because they’re just distracting. I want to love and cherish my partner physically and for what she has to say, and since love is an action not a feeling I find it hard to love someone for what they have to say when they make it hard for me to listen with my full attention. I want to love her and I want to love her thoughts, and when I have a disability that makes me easily distracted she can’t effectively communicate her thoughts to me and I cannot effectively receive them when she’s wearing a nose ring.

I’m not saying that there’s no such thing as an appealing facial piercing, but I’ve never seen one. And what’s more is that she (the hypothetical girl mentioned above) isn’t necessarily stupid for wearing the nose ring, I just think she’s not matured or experienced enough to realize that it’s dumb, and it’s not as attractive and grown-up as she perceives it. I knew a couple a few years older than me who got married as hippy stereotypes, the girl wore a nose ring to her wedding; and five years later there is no semblance of the hippies they were getting married wearing a hemp shirt and jeans, and the woman doesn’t wear their nose ring or keep her hair in dreads, she just looks like a typical mother of three, and the man no longer lets his curly hair grow into an afro and just graduated medical school. I think this is because they grew up and realized that it makes them look immature like they need to prove how different they are from old people, and she doesn’t bring it up but she regrets wearing that nose ring during her wedding.

I know that I rambled, but I wrote this late at night and I wanted to post it asap since I typically don’t have this kind of time and probably wouldn’t be able to work on it anytime soon. Is there some kind of modern trend that you don’t find attractive or that you find particularly attractive? Could you explain why if you had to?",26Sep2017,0

19,"The earthquake hit me hard (I live in Mexico City). I'm physically fine, and so is my family, but it really got to me.

I posted a while back that I felt lonely, and many of you resonated with said post. I think many of you thought that I was depressed or sad, I wasn't. I think sadness is now creeping towards me, and I no longer have the will to get out of the way.

The appt. I lived in was deemed too dangerous to inhabit. A friend, my neighbour, has nowhere to go and has been weeping for her family's safety. She is the only one living there, currently. My mother, me and our cats have moved to my father's house. 

I guess I should be grateful, but I honestly hate every cubic inch of this place. Everything feels so... alienating, as if I was physically here but the majority of my emotions were slowly draining away; this place is slowly poisoning me, and there's little I can do about it. I hate this situation, I abhor how manipulative my father, who makes sure we only clash and never coexist with one another, is and how his cancerous ways have formed a malevolent tumor in my brother's head.

I said last time I knew what depression was, and that was because I was driven to suicidal attempts by the very same people. I've since worked towards getting better, and I did, but it seems, to me, that everything I loved has crashed and burnt. I love mixing and producing music, yet, since the quake, I've had an unbearable tinnitus. I can't focus, and everything I look at turns to a smudge, where once I saw clearly. I hear blurrily, if that makes any sense. I feel tremors and have to watch how some cables I hung don't shake to know an earthquake isn't happening. I hear the sirens blaring in the middle  of the night. There's this impending sense of relief as if there is something, a flash of blinding light, that'd immediately take me away. I know I should feel fine that I just got a superficial cut out of this and move on. Hell, my appt. is repairable, and I know many people died or have nowhere to go.

I'd given up on my relationship with my father, being the anti-Middas: everything he touches turns to complete and utter shit. I'm starting to realize that my brother has become one of those things. My father has implanted the seed of discord into my brother's head, and there's naught but disdain and resentment for us.

To contextualize this, I have to tell my story. When I was 15, a friend's mother got lung cancer. I helped her and her mother every time I could until I just couldn't anymore. I was just depleted in every sense. At the same time, I was ignored by my family, and dedicated no time towards bettering myself or talking with pretty much anyone else. I felt suicidal, and talked to my mother about it. There is something surreal in telling someone close that you want to kill yourself. 

We planned and took a trip, fueled by credit, to Europe with a friend of my mom's. Everything was so real, and I managed to see that there are more things to life other than being the perfect student for a subject you hate and living the life a full colostomy-bag imposed on you. That was my turning point and I 

So I sought and found an amazing opera singer who taught me all I know about spirituality and singing that I know. I studied under her tutoring for a couple of years and found a reason to live. In that time, I moved out of my father's place into my now-empty appt.

I loved for the very first time. I was loved as well. I finally remembered what not being empty inside felt. I knew I had cost my mother hundreds of thousands of pesos in debt, but it was all worth it. She was changed, too. There's a sublime satisfaction in changing someone's life for the better; turns out she'd tried to kill herself many times, since I was little, with complete disregard of how I'd be left alone with a leech who feasts on souls. She now had, as well, some motivation back in her life, helping me out and caring for her cats and me.

My brother, having formed a codependency with my father, stayed with him, and started growing a resentment towards us. I attribute it to me being in search of my happiness and well being. I feel he's struck mediocrity in every personal development sense. I felt, and still feel, saddened by his stunt in growth, but my mental health and potential for happiness is more important to me than anything else.

And that's what my place meant to me. It's a symbol of my will to get better; to find and value myself.

And I can't help but feel like that has just been taken away for me.

I feel like I've been stolen that, and that I've regressed all those years' development I put all my hard work into, and everything's terrible again.

I fear falling back into depression, and had to get all this ""negrura"" (blackness, I guess) out of my soul. To everyone who read this, I hope you've found happiness and can work towards it. I'll be happy for everyone who's working hard in bettering themselves.

To everyone who feels like they live in a black hole that consumes all feelings and will, you are not alone. I'm thinking of you whenever I work hard to stop feeling empty, and I hope you find your way in this convoluted maze that is life.

Note: many people IRL know my handle. Nothing of this is a secret, but many things are told in passing, and lack perspective. I'm sorry if you disagree with how I felt this, but this is my reality based on my perception. I may be wrong to how you see my story, but, to me, it doesn't get any more real than this.

I like idea of although being fragile, I am so hot and horny for this kink that I can't help myself.


Yet I have only 35 friends on facebook and many people think I have some problems (maybe I do idk) and even gossiped that I could be a virgin. I am not, but I was only with three guys in my life. 2 of them were long term relationships. I like being single for two years now.
I often fantasize about this, whether that I go to fancy hotels for a client, whether some nerdy virgin pays me to come to his comfy place and I charge him half (or third if he is skinny). Or maybe older middle aged bi curious woman? Or even younger woman but that is not realistic at all but fun to fantasize.

30,"Dear Father,
 
It's been months since you've passed, and it's been just as long since I've gotten my thoughts straight. I regret my failure to write since then, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Your passing hit hard; as if my heart was torn from my chest, and even though I tried to hold back tears as best I can. I constantly think of the world without you. Though you were absent from our home for what feels like forever, it seems as if you were just hear yesterday. Sitting on the couch, watching your tv crime dramas. Easily irritated by every little thing. But that was home to us, that was family, and love. You would get angry, maybe yell a bit, maybe we'd yell at each other. Although, looking back on it, I would give anything for you to just be mad, or frustrated with me just one last time.

I don't think anyone could understand this, but I'm sorry if I ever let you down. I'm sorry if at any point, you ever came close to no longer loving me. You didn't though. I felt as if I was a shame to the family, but in those last few months, you made me feel loved. I needed that, because in those last months, I felt nothing but hate in my heart. I was unloved, unwanted, my world was flipped upside down right in front of me. It seemed as if no one, not even my friends or coworkers would care. While I would try to search for someone to talk to about how I felt, everyone would turn their backs on me. I was left to drown myself in substance abuse until I was broke, and near death. Then one day, you were there. Laying in the hospital bed, and you couldn't say anything. Sure I could've just ranted to you, and it's not like you could tell anyone. But you were laying there, fighting. For two years, you fought harder than anyone else ever had. And you fought the hardest battle, the losing battle. You knew there was no way you would make it through this, and somehow be granted an extra 20, or however many years of life. But you still fought. The most amazing part? You made it look easy. Even when times were rough, when you were clearly in pain. During the year that I never heard your voice once, you made it look easy. As if you looked at the Lord himself and said, ""Not yet. I'm not done."" And you kept going. For the last few moments with your wife, your son and daughter, and your grandchild. You'll never see him grow up, I cry when I think about that. But he sees you, every time he looks at the photos of you, he says ""grandpa!"" With a huge smile, and a face full of excitement.

And in that moment that I watched you fight, I realized that it isn't so bad. My heart was broken by the girl who I was head over heels in love with, but that meant nothing now. I had my moments with you, and if they were in silence watching shows like NCIS, Hawaii Five-O, Miami Vice, or whatever just happened to be on at the time. Then it was worth it. Your fight was worth it.

I've never really accomplished anything, or finished anything. I'm the first person to ask for closure, and the last to give it. I've never been good with goodbyes, or endings. I remember one time I couldn't break up with a girl, so I ignored her for two weeks until she finally dumped me, then ran about a house party screaming I'm free. This time is different though. This time, I'm going to finish this. Simply because, this is not my ending, it's the beginning. A new life, where I've learned all things are precious, and that everyday is a gift from god. This ending is yours though, and you know what? It was the best final chapter to any story ever written. Although it was silent, it screamed one last ""Hooah!"" in the face of death. Anything and every thing except ""no."" So Father, when you get to heaven to be judged by our maker, do your son a favor. Give him hell.",26Sep2017,0

I Don't know why I'm making an update really, basically just to vent. The last week I felt pretty good in all honesty. I actually managed to fool myself sometimes into thinking that maybe I hadn't been depressed for years and I was just lacking motivation. I kept going to classes, kept talking to that girl increasingly more, hell I even tried hard in work which is something I never do. I started updating my resume to get a new job, I was friendlier, more happy, etc.

After I finished college (late) the other day I met a guy who I've known for years. Not really a friend, but we go way back and used to talk in school and shit. Always kind of on the same wavelength. It was night, he was drunk, I was sober. Dude was noticeably upset cause he thought his friends didn't care about him and he admitted to me he's felt depressed as fuck for years. He told me nobody listens though, and that he's thought about suicide before, but couldn't do it to his parents. I felt floored. I wanted to help, I wanted to tell him I relate all too well, but instead I just ended up giving him the basic 'people do care man, you just can't see it cause you're depressed' bullshit. I told him I at least care what happens. He told me thanks and that I've always been a really upbeat guy. I split a cab home with him, wondering how many people I know have really felt like this, and how nobody has a fucking clue how anybody else feels deep down.

I think that kinda impacted my mood, but yesterday I felt fucking exhausted all day. Like a walking zombie. I was talking to that girl in the morning for hours. We were snapping each other constantly, about random bullshit throughout our day. It'd been increasingly like this the last few days. Like both of us just wanted to talk to each other every minute all day, didn't matter about what. I didn't mention it in the original post I don't think, but the reason I've never told her how I feel is cause she has a boyfriend. Anyway, I asked her if she had a break during college, kinda hinting we should hang out. She said she was going shopping with her boyfriend. I just replied it's cool, and that she deserves a break from shitty college anyway. But then we stopped talking for the rest of the day, and I kind of wondered whether she doesn't want to talk to me while she's around her boyfriend, like she feels guilty or something. It's like bringing him up made us both realise we probably shouldn't be acting like this or something. Made me feel like an asshole for making such an effort with a girl who's taken. 

Anyway, I woke up today feeling fucking awful. Like worse than I've felt for ages. Every little thing has annoyed me all day. I don't know if it's the shit with the girl, or the guy I met from school, or just plain old depression. All day tiniest shit that shouldn't bother me has been frustrating me to no end. I feel like people are talking too loud and that I'm gonna snap at someone for some stupid shit that doesn't even matter. I felt exhausted when I woke up, it's a genuine miracle I got up. I've been snarky to my family all day and I feel like a fucking asshole for it, but even talking to people feels aggravating today. I tried to nap but I just tossed and turned like an idiot. I tried talking to that girl today but we had like a 5 minute conversation and it was over.

I dunno, it feels like I've woken up and realised in the last week I accomplished nothing. All I've really done is manage to drag my sorry ass to class, start hunting for a new job, talked everyday to a girl who has a fucking boyfriend and failed to help a guy who's just as depressed as I am. I feel like how I've felt today is closer to who I've really been the last few years and that motivation was just a phase. I'm just a moody, broody asshole who struggles to do the most basic shit right. Even when I think I'm doing better I'm just doing destructive shit, like potentially damaging a good friend's relationship. I feel like maybe deep down this is who I am, and that fucking scares the shit out of me.

**TL;DR:** After a week of motivation, I feel like I've come crashing down already. I've really accomplished nothing, and done some things even this week that are just fucking dick moves when I sit and think about them. Today I've snapped at people for no reason, been moody as fuck and feel like I'm never gonna get it right. Depression fucking sucks.",26Sep2017,2

43,"TL;DR for those of you who don't wanna read this massive post: I was diagnosed with autism a dozen years ago and over the past four days I managed to earn three nominations and an award for hard work and being able to relate to people from one job and get runner up for best scares in a haunted house that I just started working at this weekend.

So, I'm gonna start off with this: I'm autistic. I don't tell people about that... really, ever. It just gets weird if I do. I was diagnosed when I was twelve, when I was getting bullied for being weird and constantly getting mocked for having a really bad speech impediment. I'm talking like words slurring together, really fast mumbling, r turning into w, I think I even struggled with the ""ch"" sound. It was pretty bad. On top of that, I could not relate to people at all. I couldn't read facial expressions for the life of me, could not make eye contact, incredibly shy... I hated every part of being autistic and hearing the doctor diagnose me with autism for the first time felt like a death sentence.

Fast forward twelve years to the present. I'm working two jobs right now, one as a barista for a local grocery store and the other as a haunted house actor at a local theme park. Last weekend was the first weekend that I started scaring, this is important.

So last weekend I was up in this specific haunted house and on the first night I was in the seance room as a medium. This room typically has two people inside it, both the medium and a vengeful spirit. I was in it by myself.

Additionally, this haunted house can be considered one of the more complicated houses in the park (there are actually several houses that people can go to,) due to the fact that the actors not only cover the room they're in but also have to bounce in between adjacent rooms to provide additional scares. For instance, I was in the seance room but I could also jump through a passage behind a moving bookcase to go into the root cellar. The house is designed this way to give the guests the impression that the house is endless and that there are way more actors than there actually are.

So not only did I have to fill a two-person room by myself, but I also had to juggle a secondary room at the same time.

That night, my first night working as a scare actor, I got runner-up for best scare of the night. The winner honestly deserved it for handling like twenty wardrobe malfunctions and bringing a really stunning performance (she had this piercing shriek that can make anyone jump, and then she would start sobbing which creates this really complex horror-pity reaction from the guests. Goodness gracious.) But I was the next in line for my performance. That in itself amazed me.

Then yesterday came at my barista job when my department manager as well as the HR manager came up to the cafe to talk to me. Apparently they had this annual awards ceremony on Saturday for the employees to celebrate hard work and such. I couldn't make it due to the fact that I had to be at the haunted house for opening. The HR manager started off with, ""You haven't even been here for four months and you've wowed us so much."" I was nominated for three separate awards, one for being a role model of an employee, one for being reliable whenever things go awry, one for being a team player. And then I won an official award that reads as follows: ""In recognition of your creative, exciting, and attention drawing announcements. **You have the voice of a legend.**"" The bold part is actually bolded and underlined on the certificate. I won the Amazing Announcer Award for the year, beating out probably about a hundred other employees.

I managed to keep my cool when the award and nominations were handed to me and when the picture was being taken, but once they left I had to lean against my sink and try not to cry with joy. I still panic whenever someone asks me to repeat something, I still get scared that I misread people when I'm in a conversation, and I cannot for the life of me navigate a group conversation.

But, yet, I have earned multiple accolades and commendations for my ability to speak and communicate and scare and inspire. I even earned an award for grabbing the attention of uncaring customers over a PA system. I have a physical trophy, even, it's sitting right behind me in its cute plastic glory.

I've come so far from my days of not being able to have a coherent conversation with someone. I know these awards are so small in the grand scheme of things. They're so tiny. A local haunted house in a local theme park and a single store out of about a hundred in the chain of a local corporation. But still. It means so much to me, whether or not anyone else even knows.",26Sep2017,6

45,"Hey folks,

I recently found a new job and had to submit a drug test (mouth swab). They told me to come in last week to fill out some new hire paperwork. I was a little nervous on the way in and smoked a cigar on the drive there. When I arrived they told me I would be submitting my drug screen and they would call me back once they received the results. The combination of the cigar and my anxiousness caused me to have a really dry mouth. Me and another guy both did our drug test at the same time. He was out in about five minutes. I sat there for close to 15 minutes before the woman administering the test asked me to remove the mouth swab and place it in the tube. The test was sent off to a lab to be analyzed. I informed the woman administering the test that I am am prescribed a medication that will make me fail (Adderall). She said that they can usually tell the difference between an illegal drug and a prescription medication and I would have to verify that I do in fact have that prescription.
Yesterday, I received an email stating that my job offer had been rescinded due to me failing the drug screen. I called the phone number listed and spoke to a woman regarding the situation. She told me I had failed because of Amphetamines (Adderall) and marijuana.
I, like lots of other good folks here, partook in my fair share of weed smoking in college, but it has been years since I so much as saw a marijuana leaf. I was shocked. I told her that there was no way, as I did not smoke marijuana. She told me I could 'challenge' the results of the drug screen by paying $110 to have the specimen retested, but only if there was enough of the specimen to retest. I agreed and she stated she would verify with the lab that there were enough specimen left and she would call me back.
In the meantime, I went to my local pharmacy and purchased a urine drug test. As expected, I passed the drug test I purchased.
I'm not sure what to do at this point. The job is a really good opportunity for me and I have been trying to get in with this company for awhile now.
If anyone has any similar experiences or advice they could share that would be great.

Also, the only medicines I take are Adderall XR 20mg and Escitalopram 10mg. Outside of the occasional cigar (tobacco), I do not drink or use any kind of drugs whatsoever.

Thanks in advance!",26Sep2017,1

49,"Do the basic principles of this world that so many of us learn as a child eventually expire or become obsolete? 

Are they no longer required? Do they no longer work? Have they ever? 

Love. Forgiveness. Gratitude. Hope.
Humility. Acceptance. Peace. 
Mindfulness. Courage. Honesty. Faith. 

Do we persevere to uphold these principles or skulk in the inevitable shadows cast by their counterparts? 

Treat others how you would like to be treated. 
Think of others how you would like to be thought of. 
Respond to the darkness of hate not with violence and rage, but with compassion and resolve. 

Find your own voice and speak out... in the spirit of unity - not uniformity. 
Embrace the miracle of individuality and help others do the same. 
Be different, unique, and weird. 

Discuss ideas freely and openly without fear of oppression or condemnation.
Practice critical thinking and question the puzzle, for we are all integral pieces.
Open your mind and your heart. 
Believe there is more.
Learn.

Do these principles only exist in a certain time and place?

Do they crumble or diminish in value based on the scope or scale of a given situation or event?
Do they remain idealistic tales or can we put them into action right now, wherever we are, whoever we are, and despite the circumstance? 

Should they be cast aside in the face of adversity?
Because of potent emotion?
Because we are scared?

Should we be afraid of our fear or deny its presence?

Are these principles not universal?
Do they only apply to you and me, but not them? 

Is it okay to forget and then remember?
Is it okay to change your mind?
Is it okay to not have an answer? 

Who decides?

Is it good, bad, right, and wrong or is it just what we make it?

Are we on time? Are we too late? 
Who is making the schedule? 

Are we not measuring up? Are we not enough?
Who is marking the measurement? 

Is it safer to think in terms of black and white?
Do we think in absolutes for the prospect of absolution?
Does the importance of truth and sanity wane as time goes on or when times are tough?

Is dissolution an irreversible state of failure?

Is it weak to cry, to hurt, to surrender, to ask for help? 
To admit that we need each other… that we want each other?
To admit our fallible humanity?

To admit that we are not so sure anymore. 

Should we compromise these principles and what we know is right for our family, for our country, for any reason?

Are we fools to forgive and trust again… and again?
How many chances do we deserve? 
How many times are we allowed to change directions?

Do we shut our eyes and hide from the world, from ourselves - snuff out the often-quiet voice within our hearts that is yearning to be heard amidst the often-loud noise? 
Do we choose to listen when we hear it or give up the choice entirely?

At some point, are we better off killing, hating, and alienating rather than healing, loving, and uniting? 
Does death eventually become our only option for reprieve? 

Should we limit ourselves to the confines of dogma?


I wonder.
