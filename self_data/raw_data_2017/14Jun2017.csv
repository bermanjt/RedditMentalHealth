0,"I was kindly redirected here to share this story of teenage idiocy.

I've never told anyone this so why not post it on Reddit? 

I found out, at much too old an age, that Paul Revere and Paul McCartney weren't the same person. Growing up, I'd heard the famous quote about the British coming and listening to the music... and I knew it happened a long time ago. I just assumed with the whole ""British Invasion"" referred to both the music and Revolutionary War. 

Argued with my teacher on this who was in stitches by the time I explained this to him.... I had no idea until my teacher assigned me a paper on Paul Revere only to realize he was wayyy less cool than I thought. 

TL;DR- Thought Paul Revere and Paul McCartney of the Beatles were the same person, made a complete fool of myself and got laughed at. ",14Jun2017,4
3,"I'm freaking out right now and seriously don't know what the hell to do. I'm on vacation with my wife, her sister and her husband, and a few other friends. The four of us have a two bedroom suite. We were out drinking and having a good time last night. The women all went back up to the rooms and the guys stayed down at the hotel bar. After a bit it's about 1am and we are all having a good time (way too much to drink). I go up to the room to grab something. My wife and her sister are both in bed and I go in to check on her. I lay down in bed and just rub her back. She rolls over and starts kissing me and before long we're naked and going at it. I finish, get dressed, and I'm back down in the bar. An hour or two later we head back upstairs. Get to the room and I'm stumbling towards bed. My brother in law points me in the other direction. WTF!? At that point I'm trying the fuck to remember which room I was in an hour earlier. I swear I was in the wrong one but can't remember shit. I pass out while trying to figure it out.

I wake up today and I'm still trying to figure out which room or if maybe this is all a dream. I'm talking to my wife. I'm asking questions trying to figure out if it was her without coming out and asking it directly. After a bit I figure out that it wasn't her. Shit! I still don't freaking know if it was a dream or if I actually fucked her sister.

My mind has been racing all day. I really don't know what to do. I can't ask her sister. What would I even say? What if she figures something out or talks to her husband or something? How do I figure out if this happened?


Edit:
It's confirmed. We go out last nite. At dinner everybody orders wine but I order water. People make some jokes but I say I'm good. I wasn't in the mood to drink anything. Later a few people want to go to the hotel bar before heading upstairs. I'm still taking pot shots for not drinking at dinner but I stick with it. My wife and her sister and one of the other women are talking. Her sister yells towards our group ""you guys should take a lesson from Mike and stop drinking so much"" They're laughing, the guys are laughing, I'm feeling really awkward.

Flash forward and I'm talking with my wife. I ask her about that earlier comment. They were talking about the night before. Her sister said her husband came back so drunk that he didn't remember having sex. I give an awkward laugh while I'm freaking out inside. There is no way this is a coincidence. Then my wife tells me that her sister and husband are having issue, yada yada they aren't having that much sex and some other crap. So I'm like WTF!? I start thinking maybe her sister knows but I really don't think she does. She wouldn't be saying all that to my wife if she knew she slept with me. The conversation is a bit changed but its from memory and I'm just putting the important part.

Edit2:
This has turned into the most awkward vacation imaginable. I keep thinking that her husband knows and is going to punch me in the face at any moment. I'm over compensating on everything with my wife. I can barely look at my sister in law without thinking about the other night. My mind is running wild. I analyze every comment she makes trying to decide if she knows. I don't think she does. But how couldn't she? I didn't know. Maybe I did. Damn, did I do this on purpose? No way, I couldn't have. Stop staring at her tits. Did she see me looking? Is she looking at me? Does my wife know? Holy fuck, I'm going insane. ",14Jun2017,50

7,"I know I sound like a crazed supervillain when I say this, but I can't stand being human. I detest it. I don't know why this is. Everything is so disgusting to me. I hate myself, I hate my mind, my body and every aspect of being human. I can't stop this constant, internal rage against my existence. It's all-consuming. I want to be something more. I want to transcend this stupid, pointless, passive existence more than anything, and my inability to do so sends me into a downward spiral of more rage and hatred. People put so much value on everything it's sickening. I wish I were smarter than them. I'm exactly the same as they are; just as pointless and disgusting and unintelligent. The only difference is I can't accept it. I need to resolve this somehow. I'm not sure how to go about doing that, but it needs to happen. I can't go through the world staggering on with the burden of such complete discontentment with everything.

9,"Through a series of rather fortunate events, I was given a roommate at random. All aspects of my life are going incredibly well, except for my roommate. And I don't want it to weigh me down, in the rest of my life, so I take to the internet, where if someone reads it, so be, and if someone doesn't, so be it.

So I'll call my roommate Carl, changed name of course, and I'm sorry to all Carls.

When I first met him, he said, ""Hi I'm Carl, I'm a man of God."" I realized I needed to get to the bottom of it, and figure out fast what I need to avoid for my time with him so I asked him what he believed, and let him guide the way, while I just asked the questions. Very quickly, I learned that he hates gays, and doesn't believe women should be anything more than a homemaker. He also doesn't believe in ""macro"" evolution. Nor does he believe that any Christian that supports gay marriage is Christian. And throughout the past bit of time I've been living with him, I've found more and more outrageous things out that he believes. I found one day that he doesn't like tapwater, because people flush prescription drugs down the toilet and we are drinking those? Another conversation I found that he genuinely believes that he knows a guy that knows a guy that didn't have autism before a vaccine, but does now.

If you haven't visualized who this person is and related it to someone else you know, I'm happy for you, so long as you think he might be a bit of a nut...

I've found he doesn't like to be relatable and spends his time studying the Bible, church 4+ times a week, etc. But I occasionally talk with him, usually it's bragging about how ""righteous"" he is and how ""my heart is so heavy with sin that I couldn't ever repent and gain forgiveness,"" but I really don't think I'm that bad, for one thing I'm not going to ask a highschooler's dad in a month if I can marry her, but I guess pedophilia isn't a sin? I've always listened, and been curious, and asked guiding questions. Until tonight, I have very rarely done more than acknowledge his beliefs and rarely expressed mine in a way to show him my beliefs, never to convince him otherwise, and in general these were non-essential beliefs, though they were always met with, ""well, that's not what the scripture says, and the scripture is factually backed up."" Well, long story short, tonight I couldn't stand to here him talk about how the gays were oppressing him, and infringing on his rights. So I told him that he can believe it to be sin all he wants, but who is he to judge? Isn't that what God is for. This as you can imagine lead to a fruitful debate, that very quickly ended with him saying that he wasn't interested in someone just trying to catch him on a technicality and not actually trying to find God. I ended by telling him that I ask all my questions because I'm interested, and that it might lead me to God, and honestly, it's making me want to go to church (not nut church though). But the audacity of someone to think so highly of themselves makes my blood boil, love thy neighbor...

One thing he's repeated is that he's a true Christian, because he follows the scripture, and he believes he found God through the Bible. He thinks no matter how he grew up he would have the same beliefs, he genuinely think God brought him here, not through parents, rather just by holding hands with God. I asked him how I would have any chance in bring a true Christian if I was never exposed he never answered...

But what I've realized is how sad it is, he was brought up to fake curiosity, but really deny anything different, and to treat differences as a personal attack. And it's sad.

It's led me to talking with friends from small towns, and understanding how they accept gays. it's fascinating. I've come to respect my rural friend, before I thought he was behind times, and now I realize that the fact that he supports love, shows just how awesome he is. He didn't grow up with bigoted views, he grew up with curiosity. And he doesn't hold himself on a pedestal, looking down on all the sinners....

It's neat seeing the differences, but I'm pretty tired if hearing how good of a Christian my roomie thinks he is, despite his inability to forgive, live, or love. And while my blood boils, I want to understand him.",14Jun2017,15

16,"  First I would like to say that I'm not posting this to boast. I hate it when people do something generous and make it about themselves. It undermines what the act should be about: supporting our fellow man. The purpose of this post is not to gain recognition, but to start a discussion and encourage others to help those in need.

  On my way home, I met a homeless man and I stopped. He asked for some money. I sat down and we talked for a few minutes. I ended up giving him twenty dollars. He said he wanted something to drink. I know he was going to buy alcohol, but at least he was honest. I can't assume he is an alcoholic. It was obvious that he was struggling. The man was in poor health and told me he had recently gotten out of prison. He offered to get weed for us to smoke together, but I declined because I needed to get home and eat, and I have work in the morning. When I gave him the money, he seemed appreciative, and when we talked he was humble. I felt that he was a good man in a bad place.

  I'm pretty poor myself. When I'm out twenty dollars, I feel it. It's kind of a lot of money to me right now, but at least I have a steady income and I am young and healthy. I gave my money to the homeless man because he needed it more than I do. We are all in this life together. Recently someone gave me a hundred dollars. When I helped the homeless man, I initially felt guilty for giving away 20%, but I realized that's exactly what paying it forward is. I feel satisfied with my decision.",14Jun2017,3
21,"Apparently when you are banned from a subreddit it's frowned upon to use another account to use that subreddit. Even if your alt account existed well before you got banned on another account, you will be permanently banned for just looking at that sub.

When a ban is unjustified there is no recourse against lazy, corrupt, ineffective, tyrannical mods. Community moderation has become intolerably awful on this website. When I want to participate in a good community with bad mods that banned me, I get in trouble. 

It seems there is either a robot or worse a live person watching my IP address because my new account was permanently banned less than a day after it was made just for posting in r/writingprompts, who's mods are among the most incompetent I've ever seen.

38,"I was going to get married Friday.

The past month and a half have been the worst times of my life. It was so sudden. She has been hiding her depression so well and through the mountain of stresses she had recently, she just... collapsed. She left me, she left her family and she pointed her finger at me instead of asking me for help.

Every day has been a literal hell. She has cacooned herself into working 80 hour weeks and sitting in her room at her coworkers house.

She's been recently prescribed the highest dose of level 1 antidepressants you can do. She still believes she's gone too far and can't come back to me.

All this time all I've wanted to do is help her. I can help but she will not let me. She wants to completely remove me from her life to fix herself yet she's stagnating in a hole of depression.

She doesn't believe in counciling and I feel like I keep losing her everyday. Little by little this hell is pulling me further away from her.

I can't take this.

Friday is suppose to be my wedding. But now every day closer is a separate level of hell that burns hotter everywhere I turn.

42,"Over the past six months, my life has made a complete 180. I was studying music in New York for two years, working a part-time job as an I.T. Help Desk Technician, and before long, I realized that I liked working on computers more than I liked my lifelong pursuit in classical music. On top of that, my long struggle with mental illness had become too much to handle. After two hospitalizations from suicidal depression, I finally decided it was time for a change in pace. I moved back home, I got a job working as a computer technician at an office supplies store (not the flashiest job out there, but it's something), and I started pursuing a degree in computer engineering at a community college.

Now that it's the summer, I'm still taking a couple gen-eds, but I have more time on my hands. I'm looking to create better habits financially and nutritionally, and I'm looking to come out ahead once I finally have my degree. I'll be using /r/self as a sort of accountability platform in order to keep track of my goals. A few of the things I hope to accomplish over the next 100 days:

&amp;nbsp;




1. Use codecademy to learn html, css, and start learning the C programming language. (I won't be starting my programming classes until the fall, so I'd like to get ahead as much as possible).
2. Run a half-marathon
3. Spend less than $150 a month on fast food, casual restaurants. 
4. Practice guitar more frequently
5. Try to see one friend every week
6. Search and apply to more colleges
7. Discover new music
8. Work on a body-weight fitness routine
9. Read more
10. Travel to a national park

They confronted her and she stopped for a while, but just recently I saw a text on her phone from some random guy living in another state saying stuff like ""Baby I miss you"" and she would say it back.

My sisters have moved out but I'm still under the legal age, so I live with my parents. I know that if I confront her she'll either deny it or yell at me for ""assuming"" things. After I saw the text, I didn't know what to do and told my sisters about it and they already knew about it. Apparently she was questioning whether or not the cameras around their work place could record sound, where they were place and stuff. She also makes excuses to go outside into her car, and won't sleep in the same bed as my dad anymore. 

I think my dad knows too. The other day we drove by the workplace and saw her on the phone. He said ""She sure talks a lot, huh? Wonder who she's talking to.""

Because I'm young or something, I'm the only one who she still let's go through her phone. My sisters told me to write down her number and so I did and they said they want to call him and ask him if he knows she had three children?? or if he knows that she's still married???

50,"I've seen a lot of people condemning the violence that took place in Virginia today, and while I do not support the actions taken by the shooter, I disagree with the sentiment that we do not solve our problems with violence. This country was founded by people who used violence to achieve their goals. Our military uses violence overseas on a daily basis to achieve our government's goals. Our governments (Federal, State, and Local) use violence against citizens on a daily basis to achieve their goals. Our citizens use violence daily against each other to achieve their goals. Violence is the most effective tool available in the tool box to effect change quickly, it only becomes a bad thing when that violence is directed at you or those you support. When our elected leaders become more concerned with party politics and political power and influence than they are with what's best for the country, violence is the only tool available to the people to rip control of the country back from those wishing to do it harm.

This wasn't an incident of a mentally ill person shooting up a school, or a church, or a workplace. This was an individual who felt abandoned by the government that is supposed to look out for him and felt the most effective move he could make was to refresh the tree of liberty with the blood of patriots and tyrants...just as our founding father's intended.
