1,"I actually think that I may have bi polar disorder. Sometimes I feel super confident, and other times I feel so bad that I question why I'm even living. Somedays I can feel and others I feel dead inside. When will this end... I'm so sick of this.  I was able to feel so many feelings when I was young, and now I don't even understand my feelings, in fact I'm not sure if I have any. I try to better myself but I feels like I just can't. 2 steps forwards and 3 steps back kind of feeling. So shitty. Sucks how I have to feel this way on Thanksgiving. Heck I'll probably feel confident tomorrow anyways.",10Oct2017,1

6,"I love the fact that we can connect with millions around the world (including my friends and long-separated family members) with just a few clicks and typing.  It's like a mix of email, messenger and texting combined.  However, I'm starting to despise the broader Facebook community as a whole (well not really hate, more like a strong disdain).  It feels like just another YouTube comments section, except without all the trolls but still with a lot of the stupidity.  

I sign on to Facebook because I want to connect with my close friends/family without having to call them or memorize their emails.  But being on Facebook isn't just about that.  My wall gets a bunch of ""Suggested posts"", which are often incredibly intrusive and worse than YouTube ads.  I want to hear from my friends/family without seeing mindless promoted content that I could otherwise get from 9gag and YouTube Poops.  Some of it is okay, others not.

Next off are the comments.  They tend to be even more negative than YouTube, and they are full of sanctimonous keyboard warriors who often know nothing about what they are talking about before going on the attack.  Constantly looking the gift horse in the mouth and leaving nothing constructive.  It's like a mix of Tumblr activism and YouTube comments.  No anonymity may reduce the 1337spk and trolls, but it seems to have only a small impact on reducing the genuine vitriol and stupidity.  

Don't get me started on the activists there:  Much of the ""participants"" are just keyboard warriors who leave nothing but destructive and often hateful criticism.  Or posts on company walls like ""How could not not think my dog was cute?  I hate you and I hope you go out of business!""

For the record, I'm not going to stop using Facebook as it is a useful tool for connecting to friends/family and websites.  However, I don't want to participate in the cancerous broader community. ",10Oct2017,10
7,"I’m 20 years old now and most of my life I can admit I’ve been pretty immature, Immediaetely after high school I felt stuck in that childish mentality and I have been trying to grow as a person. Ever since turning 20 in July and finally getting my shit together going to a decent university now, I have started losing communication with a shit ton of high school friends which were bestfriends to me for many years. I feel like a majority of these people are still stuck in that high school mentality. I still have many good friends it’s just I miss these guys I use to kick it with on the daily, but me wanting to grow and change as a person while they are stuck in the past not caring about anything I just can’t go back to that stage. if anyone has any input or has lost communication with people due to the same reasons comment below.",10Oct2017,1

13,"I'm looking for something beyond just everyone is the hero of their own story so they only focus on themselves. One thing I've noticed about myself personally is that I get told I'm a good listener fairly often but the reason I ask this question is I'm legitimately curious/amazed just how little attention people actually pay to their surroundings. 

I remember one time in high school I was talking to this girl and she said she was going to have a party during the weekend, come Monday I asked her how the party was and she looked shocked like I had followed her around or something. 

She had just forgotten that she had told me, but still, I feel like half the time I get told I'm a good listener it's just because I actually remember something. 

Now, I'm actually interested in people and I'll make an effort to actually get to know them but what's funny to me is half the things I remember about someone are normally just surface level things if they're acquaintances and that's just me making a minimal effort on my part. When it comes to my actual friends I can name off their hopes, dreams etc. 

It just blows my mind that my minimal effort to pay attention/listen on my part is considered amazing to someone else. Like if that's impressive to you, you would be amazed at me remembering conversations that happened years ago. 

Has anyone else encountered this? This is something that I run into frequently so I'm super curious.

14,"I’m 23 male and consider myself quite stubborn. I’ve noticed my friends have stopped asking me to hang out because I usually decline. I’m quick to say no and have found that this response is prevalent in almost all aspects of my life. I’m also timid and unsure of myself when asked to participate in new projects at work. I’ve heard that “openness to new experiences” is a key phrase that employers are interested in seeing in their employees. Am I like this because of my low self confidence? And are there any exercises towards improving myself in this particular field?

15,"There are so many drivers in my city that I never meet the same one again, and when I realised that, I started to treat each one as disposable, a conversation I could bail on in 15 minutes if it started to get uncomfortable. Uber drivers seem to be more talkative than regular cabbies, I guess it's the rating system. 

I started with the typical, bitching about our days set ahead, our future ambitions, I grew the balls to delve into politics, issa bad idea, conversationally, but you mumble what's on your mind.

I met a guy who was a physics teacher, just doing this for the money. We spoke about mathematics. It just felt like one of the most satisfying conversations I've ever had. Everything flowed. I kept looking for that feeling, kept trying to 'read' each guy for things on their mind, talking about all sorts of stuff. Shit, eventually I didn't want to leave the car.

16,"I work three jobs. One is full time during the week, one is about 10 hours on weekends, and one is from home and takes about 20-30 hours a week.  

I got married a few months ago and I'm swimming in debt. We adopted a dog and she's wonderful but I don't have time for her. We moved into a larger place that's walking distance from both my workplaces and accommodates my dog but rent is 75% of my main job's paycheck.

My husband isn't working right now because of mental health issues but he's planning to start looking for work after his dad's memorial next week. His dad killed himself a few weeks ago and it's been overwhelming. He's starting therapy in a few days, and once he goes back to work I'll have some breathing room.  

I'm also taking two college classes that thankfully are easy and don't take up much of my time.  

Anyway, the reason I'm writing this is that it's Thanksgiving and I spent it all working because my from-home assignment is due at 10am and it will take me literally all night to finish it, if I even finish it. Usually it takes me 25 hours and I'm still about 20 hours from being done. 10am is less than 12 hours away, so do the math.  

I told my dad's family that I was at my mom's, and my mom's side that I was at my dad's, and we just stayed home so I could work.  

I can't even ask for an extension because they already gave me one because I was really sick last week. Even if I asked for an extension, I have no time to do it because I'm busy every single day this week after work - dog training class, four family dinners (two Thanksgiving, one pre-memorial, one birthday), and the memorial.  

So basically I'm not sleeping tonight, and I won't be sleeping for at least 22 hours or whenever I get home from the dog training class which ends at 8:30.  

The work from home job is thankfully a contract that ends in about a month, but I'm so tired. I'm so fucking tired but I can't do anything else but work.",10Oct2017,4
18,"Hey Internet friends,

So basically all my life, I’ve struggled with just being unhappy and feeling unfulfilled—unless I’m currently in a romantic relationship. It just seems to make me feel so much more gratified. It’s like I’m addicted to being in love or something...which maybe doesn’t sound that crazy, but it’s definitely inconvenient. I just recently got out of another relationship that was quite important to me, and I’m having trouble moving on, not just because breakups are hard (I mean that’s obvious), but because I just went from feeling complete to feeling unfulfilled again. 

And it’s not just when I’m dealing with breakups. I spent a long time single before this relationship, and that whole time I just couldn’t make myself happy. I’ve heard the typical advice, that I need to work on myself, focus on what I like, and keep close friends and all that, and I’ll be happy with just who I am. But it doesn’t work, I’ve done it all, given it my best shot, and I’m just never happy alone. Feels like a piece of me is missing if I can’t share myself fully with someone else. 

And I’m sick of it! It really sucks to be borderline depressive just because I don’t have a girlfriend, and it’s soooo draining to always be chasing after a relationship and seeing myself fail again and again. If I could be happy with myself, I so would be. I just can’t, it feels like, no matter what I try. 

So, how do I overcome this? How do I become a complete person all by myself? 

TL;DR: I’m lonely and feel incomplete whenever I’m single, and no matter what I do it still feels that way. Help!",10Oct2017,2

For context, this is college. I've been through this before (I was a stupid high school kid), and now I tried really hard to prevent this because I knew it'd happen. As soon as I started feeling things I thought that I had to stay emotionally detached no matter what. I can't invest emotionally. And then I did, with thoughts and fantasies. And now the thought of her not being interested makes my stomach churn.

We enjoy each other's presence genuinely. At the very least she sees me as an equal, as an *actual* friend. Not the delusional version where I'm just a nice guy trying hard to get her to like me. She's actually one of the coolest girls I've met, and one of the most compatible girls I've met. So that's nice I guess.

32,"I'm at a point right now where I really don't know what to do. Everything seems to be spiraling out of control, and I want to both gain a grip on the situation, work to resolve it, and turn my life around. I am seeing a mental health counselor on Wednesday. The following is the series of events that have led to my current situation and poor mental state.

### Background ###

I am a freshman, started college about 1.5 months ago. I started texting with a girl a few months back and things progressed extremely quickly once we got to college. She was my first everything after kissing. Over the first month of college, we were in some of a relationship. Things moved quickly, there were some issues early on that led us to take a break for one weekend. We were really really close, staying over at each other's place 4-6 times a week, sex almost every other day, and she occupied a significant amount of my free time. I became close with people on my floor in the kind of L shape of my hall that formed around my room (I am in the corner room). I have small groups of people I hang out with, but none that I am nearly as close with. They, school, the girl I was seeing, all occupied my time. It was the first time in a while that I had my shit together in life, and everything seemed like it was working out. There was a period of a few days where I had no worries, my first few grades were good, me and the girl were good, and I had a good group of close friends and some other friends, and I was sleeping pretty well too. My relationship with the girl was spotty, and somewhat unhealthy at times. It is good that things eventually ended, but it's hard to let go. 

### A little before the end ###
The girl and I had been going well with one problem, she had been getting rather close with another guy. During our short break (roughly 2.5 weeks in), she and this guy hung out a bit, and I saw another girl. Once we got back together, I broke everything else off, but she continued to hang with this guy in a non-sexual way. In the week or so leading to us ending things, she was pretty secretive about this guy, and assured me nothing was happening there. 

### Two weeks ago - the end ###
We sat down and had a much more serious talk about what was happening between me, her, and the other guy. She didn't want us to keep having problems. I posed her the question of staying with me, or going to the other guy (nothing physical had happened between them at this point). After a lot of talking, some crying, she decided she wanted to be with the other guy. *(I asked her then and more recently if I was doing anything wrong, and she insisted/insists that everything was fine on my end, she just had some weird feeling with this guy which attracted her to him.)* That was two weeks ago (Monday). As a result of the events on that Sunday and Monday, I ended up performing really poorly on my math quiz. I thought that the best way for me to cope would be to start having sex with someone else. And it helped. I saw this other girl multiple times over the past two weeks. During the weekend following the breakup, I danced with/kissed two other girls. I really thought that I was moving on then and things were going to start on the upward trend for me... then this past week happened.

### The past week ###
Sunday night: as I was falling asleep I started reminiscing on the past week, the break up, and how I felt towards the girl I was with for over the first month of college. I felt lonely, and my cycle of sleep deprivation began. I missed sleeping with someone else in the bed. I slept through my morning class. 

Monday: I made the decision to see/speak with her again, in person. In some ways this made things feel better, while making my nostalgia worse. 

Tuesday: my studying/cramming/preparing as much as possible for my math midterm Wednesday. More thoughts of the girl, and a significant amount of stress from the midterm. I end up being unable to fall asleep at a reasonable hour. The time keeps ticking on by and I realize that if I fall asleep (2~3AMish), I was going to miss my exam (8 AM). I pulled an all-nighter. 

Wednesday: the exam goes poorly. I can't sleep again, end up sleeping from 5-9:20AM. My sleep cycle is absolutely fucked at this point, I can't stop thinking about the girl and why she's with the other guy, and my math grade is now in a bad place. 

Thursday: I somehow end up in her room at 2AM watching Netflix. I really don't know what the fuck was happening, but we were just watching Netflix. Her drunk roommate comes in and starts trying to start shit with her. Talking about her new boyfriend and how we shouldn't be together at all. It was all fucked, I just sat there and left when I could. 

Friday: the girl has gone home for break, I'm in a really poor mental state, have barely gotten sleep. At least I had my friends, for now. At some point in the middle of the night, I was feeling really shitty. I went out to be with my friends but they were in a pissy mood. One thing led to another and we got in a big fight, and I snapped. No one in the L shape of my hall is speaking to me now. I've been back home since then, and haven't seen anyone. I suspect my relationship with them will be injured for at least 1-3 weeks... without getting into details it was a really really bad situation. 

### My mental state ###
I've just been feeling really shitty. Really shitty about the girl, my loss of my main friends, my grades, my sleep. I'm seeing a counselor when I get back Wednesday to talk about this more. I'm slowly working to piece my life back together. Sleep first, is slowly returning to normal times (23:30-7ish). I'm hoping to be back on my normal schedule by Wednesday. Next, friends, I'm in a position where I have decided to lay low for the time being from my hall neighbors. Not necessarily avoid interaction, but not make an initiative to interact. I have since apologized to them for what happened, and told them to approach me whenever they're ready. With that said, I now am in a position where I have very few friends and want to still remain social, or at least have people to talk to on a regular basis. It was easy to do during the first few weeks, but now it's harder to find a group of people I mesh with and are wanting to mesh with me. I'm going to be visiting my math professor's office hours, etc., I can fix school/grades on my own. My biggest problem is that I am very isolated now, and don't really know who to turn to or how to proceed. Do I just shelter myself in my room for the next few weeks while working on schoolwork all the time - probably not. I want things to return to a state of normalcy, be that with these friends, or another group. I want friends, I want to be with another girl, I'm just a fucking mess... 

### In closing ###

Any advice on how I should go on about my life would be appreciated. I know what I want, I just have no idea how to achieve or begin working towards resolving it. I yearn for the time a few weeks back when everything was perfect, because I feel like everything's all fucked up right now. 

tl;dr my life in college is a fucking mess because of friends, girl, school, sleep and I don't know how to proceed. ",10Oct2017,1

37,"I've been in contact with this recruiter for something like over a month, he specifically stated multiple times that XXXX company was very slow to respond and the process would take a long time...

He emailed me back multiple requirements for how my resume wasn't formatted correctly (over 20/30 times I've used this resume, now it's 'not right'?)

The issue was months/years and some overlap, I explained that I worked multiple contractor jobs/roles for many years.  Some of the precise details were lost to me, and that there was a lot of overlap.

&gt; I just heard your voice mail – I apologize for the delay.  I guess I’m a little confused because when we last spoke over the phone, you said that if XXXXXX was going to require specific years of experience, then you would just let it go.  Then I received an updated resume 2 weeks after that, at which point I had withdrawn your profile from contention.  It has since been filled.

I never said anything about experience... holy shit... I said ""If they are going to require me to get this down to a high level of precision I MIGHT have to let it go?  What should I do?"" as in... what's our negotiation space, talk with them, It's going to take some effort to make this work the way they want to see it.

So I spend like 4/6 hours making updates to my resume to fit their expected format (AKA I lied about months/days/times in order to not be ""weird"") sorted out many of the older entries down to days/mo etc..  And emailed that to him.  (about 48 hours later)

Then I call him about 2 days later, as I'm anxious to hear back from him.... FFS this is his reply to me, after ... 10 days of silence, the expectation is ""they take a long time to reply""

I'm fucking starving right now, sorting out how to get employed, sorting out jobs and spending the last 10's of dollars I have on gas to do a contract job, so I can get enough to not fall apart....

41,"These days, everyone's stressed-out and busy. They call it a sign of the times, but it's always been that way. Things change every year, and you're responsible for more and more of it until suddenly, you realize your kids stopped asking you for advice about their kids, and you're retirements all settled, and you don't know your neighbors and your friends stopped calling. Wonder if they're alive? 

I'm only 19 - oops - 23, but this sh!t is getting to me. But I won't let it get to me. I know how average I am, this generation is, the slow end-state decline of our first-world country  must be. But I won't let it get to me, because I got people, and they'll only know how stressed out and overburdened I am after the dust has settled. 

My people bought me a PS4 as a gift, which has turned into a huge headache as I can't afford an HDMI TV and I don't have internet to use it, so now I have to figure out some bullsh!t powerline/MoCA/repeater solution to make use of it. Whatever; I'll play Destiny 2 with my boy some day. 

My people offered me a job interview that is stressing me the fuck out. I don't know if I'm qualified for the position, but I know I hate the one I'm at, so I'm going for it. In one day I'll be respectfully thanking them for their time, or enthusiastically for the opportunity. Whatever; I still have this job (that I hate; whatever). 

My people are holding a huge multi-day arts festival, but it doesn't look like anyone can put me up in that city two hours away, and I can't really afford the gas/miles/tickets. Whatever; I've slept in my truck before, and if it breaks the suspension getting there, my parents will let me borrow a vehicle even if they hold it over my head (whatever). 
They won't hear me bitching, moaning, or begging - it's just more fuel for the fire I start from the stage. 

My people are finding love, but the drama is so bad I can't hardly stand to be around them anymore. And they think I don't know what I'm talking about because I can't hold a girl. Whatever; I could if I wanted to, but I haven't met the right one, and I got other priorities. They'll know when I finish this book like it's nothing. Like there was no blood, sweat, and tears, like it was easy, like it doesn't even matter to me. 

And it'll only be years down the line I vaguely allude to how difficult and stressful it was for me in those early days/decades, in a speech to all my old friends and new acquaintances. Because they don't want to hear that sh!t; they just need me to be on point. They need to see that I've got this and them, and the details aren't really important, because honestly, they're not like me. They just want to kick it. If you're on your goals, you don't need your role models to tell you how hard they work - because you know how hard *you* work. And you *got this*.

42,"Last Tuesday, a week ago from this moment I met an antichrist (has it may turns out -The Antichrist- is the one I met however there are many antichrist's and he was just The Antichrist because I could've have ended the world if I had killed this one). I am still pretty in awe about it all. Anyway, I have decided to just share my journal entry of the experience as oppose to punching it up. So, the story goes…”Upon coming home from work, I got on one bus after another and traveled in circles coming right back near where I started.  The first bus I got on a man was using profanity and then he said something I did not expect. “How could you choose them over us?” And he shouted out, “…so, how’s your progress going?” I thought, that’s odd, I was speaking about making progress in my attempts to learn to relax so I don’t scare away the angels calling on me.  I thought, because one of the women at the shelter talks about demons, oh, maybe now the demons are coming.  The bus stops and the bus driver is refusing to let a woman get on the bus which I have never seen before because she has fast food, so I immediately exit the bus and wait for the next one (I’ve actually already missed two buses previously.)  The next bus I get on takes me to a terminal and the bus driver explains to me his legs hurt because he misses his breaks due to his schedule being too tight.  We stay at the transit center for a while and he drives off.  I realize he is driving me back the way I came.  Upset and tired I get off grumbling and go to a dark bus stop with many men and wait.  My heart hurts and I feeling unbelievably spooked when I get on the next bus.  Immediately a black young man starts vocalizing, picking on a white man seated behind him.  I sit in the back and watch him indirectly.  He says, “Oh now a security guard walks right past me.”  He gets up and stalks towards the back of the bus –to the front of the bus and sits down and begins cussing.  I finally know what is happening.  I told him to come and here he was.  I felt fear of possibly having to kill him.  I decide to talk to him and see what God wants me to do next.  Strangely enough though it just happened not thirty minutes ago I am having trouble recalling the conversation. I call to him and ask him to sit and talk with me.  He accepts.  He (changed from says) asks, “You know the things I love, x…x…pussy.” I only remember that he said pussy and possibly he said money.  I said, please no profanity. He apologized and started boasting of his riches but then he would return to racist talk about white people. I would ask him to not speak that way and ask him questions about himself.  He said he was from Chicago and had attended college, (earning two degrees he said), he showed me his tattoo’s and asked me if I had ever seen a Lazo [? sp]. I told him I did not know what that was and he chuckled and said it was about my pay grade in which I laughed (in agreement).  He first said he had a son, I think he then became upset that he found himself having to ride the bus. (He expressed unhappiness with having to be in Austin.) He said he was rich, he said he was brilliant or he said another word but that he was really exceptional(ly) smart.  He said he was teething his daughter with hundred dollar bills then he got very sad.  He said he was a lion. He would say mother, he said his mother told him not to date white women; his parents collectively hated white people and then he became agitated with a neighboring white man. I said hey; No. (Getting him to stop harassing the other passenger.) He started talking about his hate of whites. I told him no don’t; I told him he has to let it go, let go the hate.  Maybe he said he can’t or maybe he said he didn’t know how but all the same he was choosing not to.  I realized I could do/add nothing more.  He asked my name and I told him Estell.  I asked him his name and he said Nobody.  I asked again, I said you have to be somebody, he said no I’m Nobody. I touched him and I said no you’re not, I know who you are.  (We were interrupted by his attempts to flirt with a Latino woman who had just got on.) A Latino woman got on the bus and he jumped up and spoke Spanish to her and then he returned to sit down next to me.  Order may not be right but I (shosh? Written) held his hand and he placed his head on my shoulder and I rubbed his hair.  He said your hands are cold than means you heart is cold. I said no, I’ve been standing outside.  He said no, your heart is cold I could not get into your heart.  I told him his hand was warm. I told him God wants him and to fight. He would not listen; I said pray with me, he said something about speaking to Jesus or Jesus saves and I tried to take his hand and lead him in pray(er), but he told me not to touch him and go ahead and pray.  I prayed a brief prayer for mercy, maybe forgiveness but he was dissatisfied; He asked, that’s how you pray incredulous and unimpressed, I said yep (yeah is written but I said yep). He said he didn’t care about what God thinks. He said he didn’t want to die.  He also scoffed saying, “Us Americans thinking everything is so easy.” Somewhere he then said I was the trunk and he was the hood of the same car.  He said packages are placed in the trunk but the motor was in the hood.  I asked him where the car was going and he said “I don’t know; to hell” and laughed. (I didn’t think that was particularly funny obviously.)  I told him it’s never over.  You have to fight. I know who you are and he said he could go everywhere (and anywhere- he said anywhere as well.) That’s what he could do. Anywhere.  I asked him about love; he said he had a white baby.  He said his white woman told him she didn’t want to be with him because he didn’t love her.  I may have asked him if he was sad but he (said) no, that was just some pussy but he said he missed the kids.  He said to me I am not violent maybe some variation that he wasn’t bad. I made him look at me I said you have to fight… (Told him I was getting off.)  I walked off the bus and called out his real name. And I walked glumly thinking of how when I expected to meet him and asked him to come I expected anything other than this.  I worried if I hadn’t done something I should but reminded myself that there are no second chances and I warned him; I have warned may if not all but this point and that my responsibilities had changed. I felt secure that God was both directing and protecting me and I beg God for Creator mercy, Creator forgiveness and Creator grace over me. I asked for Creator mercy for all of us humans.  When I walked past my actual stop he was on the corner proclaiming his riches to a woman at the bus stop, he will have to wander until whenever knowing who he was but being nobody; I walked past ignored and thought I got something very wrong, going crazy is not what happens to saints it’s what happens to antichrists. (end)
So everyone, guess who I just shared a bus ride with? Cain, yep that one exactly, reincarnated, I’ll let you play the anagram game and marvel.  Guess who almost ended the world, yep, that would be me. Genesis 4:24 “If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times.” Lamech is five generations removed from Cain.  I had just recently return to an old conundrum, I never believed in Twin Peaks Agent Dale Cooper would have ran from Bob, I never thought he would let his fear get the best of him in the Black Lodge. I guess after a week of reviewing the experience I think my take away is that you shouldn’t resort to violence out of fear.  Also, that yes that guy made a choice and he has to sit under the label antichrist forever more, but, we weren’t different. I’m not good or better than him I’m just lucky really. I have to tell you all, when I held him in my arms it just felt like comforting a little boy. The sadness I have felt for the victims of the Las Vegas shooting and those trying to recover from the various natural disasters has really shook me.  You have to understand, there are many things in our society, in our hearts and minds, in the world that has to change.  There’s a lot of work to be done and yes the devil remains with us plotting and planning against us but I think we’re one big step closer and he’s down a soldier. I have to tell you, God does not deal in punishment. I think with knowledge comes responsibility. Us humans, we could have had it easy and kicked it in the Garden of Eden but we would’ve fell eventually.  We require intellectual stimulation.  I think everything, all these generations God has been trying to get us back to Eden square. But God, who is our Creator does not understand us either and we of course do not understand Creator. The devil is always trying to break our bond and he only wants us humans because there’s a bit of God inside of each and every one of us. Hell, is a manmade invention.  We each create our own hell. My hell was being alone in torment forever.  Cain’s was being a nobody.  If you’re reading this and you’re torturing yourself over something stop it.  Find your strength, and face it whatever it is. Ezekiel 33 12-20 “Therefore, son of man, say to your people ‘If someone who is righteous disobeys, that person’s former righteousness will count for nothing.  And if someone who is wicked repents, that person’s former wickedness will not bring condemnation.  The righteous person who sins will not be allowed to live even though they were formerly righteous.  
If I tell a righteous person that they will surely live, but then they trust in their righteousness and do evil, none of the righteous things that person has done will be remembered…”
Please trust in God and have faith. We must complete the mission.  Also, I’m sorry if this is disappointing to a lot of people, I asked God specifically that I do not do miracles of any sort.  If you read your Bible I think you will see I am not Jesus (and not because I fear that or don’t want to be I mean exactly I am not –I’m in there you just gotta pay attention), funnily enough shortly before meeting the antichrist I was anointed so I guess I am a Christ. It’s kinda like Buffy and Harry Potter Celestial edition.  There are many Judges, there have been many Christ’s (yeah, if you remember my previous preoccupations yep that’s one) and consequently many antichrists. It’s the basic principle of Chemistry, all equations must balance and nothing created is ever really destroyed.  But I’m not Esther guys. It’s a good story but I am not Esther, my name is Estell.  I mean, look who didn’t punt us into nonexistence? Me. So I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed by the enormity of the responsibility I have been entrusted with. I am unprepared even if worthy. I am like your spiritual foster mother for all of humanity and there’s no Doctor Spock manual for any of this stuff. When I read the Bible it had never occurred to me that somebody’s actually gotta do the dirty work and in no way could I ever anticipate it would be me. But, thank goodness everyone is in the world and fighting and I am telling you, the future will be sweet.

44,"I want to die and I think I'm reaching a point where it'll be easier to just let that consume me. I've lost me best friend and I have no future. I've failed at everything I've tried to do, I'm not going to make it through college, and I'm mentally ill. I have nothing left. There's no one left to care anymore and I wish I had someone to talk to but no one is around anymore and no one knows me. Therapy isn't working. I want to die. ",10Oct2017,0
45,"Yesterday the best man at my wedding passed away.

Over the years our lives drifted apart, but I felt I was in touch because I am FB friends with some of his kids (same age as mine)...

He is now gone and I regret not making more of an effort. He was only 61 years old, a few months older than I.

Life is short and hard, we do bad things and have bad things done to ourselves, but don't ever lose touch. We do all really need each other.

Thanks for listening, please take what I say to heart, life is gone too soon.",10Oct2017,1

48,"Hi everyone. I was depressed for a couple of years up until earlier this year, dealing with eating disorders at the same time. I got back with my boyfriend of three years and began living with him and life has turned out great. I don't believe I am depressed anymore and don't have any bulimic symptoms anymore. 

However, I still occasionally have these feelings of ""wanting"" a sad feeling. It's really strange but even when I know my life is good right now, I have a weird sensation of wanting to be sad. I don't know if it's because that's what I was used to before? I'm also dealing with a lack of motivation in all aspect of my life and a part of me feels like I am seeking those depressive feeling and symptoms I was experiencing before in order to justify myself for wasting everyday not doing much.

Anyone else know what I'm talking about? It's a bit hard to explain, as I don't have a complete grasp on it either but wanted to see if anyone's felt the same way and/or could explain why this is. 

Thanks.",10Oct2017,3
