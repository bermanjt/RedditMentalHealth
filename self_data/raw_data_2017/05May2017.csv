But now that none of the channels really play music videos anymore, it seems like only 6 or 7 female pop stars do I ever really hear about anymore -- Beyonce, Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, Selena Gomez, Katy Perry, and maybe Gaga.

4,"Self Promoted Man 
(Ep.1)
My innocence was taken away at the age of eleven
And in a sense I should've known it was his time so I let him
A few cents in his pocket taught us a valuable lesson 
On how we shouldn't live in poverty, be the best in economy 
Never settle for less than what you can provide for your family 
(Ep.2)
How would you feel if you had no choice but to be raised differently?
And to look back and the past and notice things have changed drastically
And those changes would've determined who you would soon to be
And those events would traumatize you and demonize your childhood leaving the scar I felt mentally  
Out of all of the boys, I was the branch that stuck out from the family tree
My daddy taught them how to play sports and gave them his full support
Since they were born first they each got a fair turn to have their mentor 
But when it was my turn to learn, for all things worse, they would turn
My dad died of ""a lot of things"" before he got to me
...
So now I'm left with no skill, no thrill, no effort to try any harder, but worst of all... NO FATHER
(Ep.3)
Story of a young man named Robert Ortiz, who had lived in the streets, who did his labor for cheap. And When he'd want to eat, he never begged in the streets, he just used those streets to get to places he needed to be
...
But the ""hero in"" his mind betrayed him for what he thought was a high 
And the demons in his soul called for an angels support 
But who supports a druggy who lives in the streets with no money, looking skinny, drinking bubbly, criminal integrity, thinking ""this world has nothing for me""?
...
No one, that's who, that was the cold hard truth.
But who can you blame when your morals come loose? 
God? The person who gave you books and tools to help you make life more smooth 
Or ourselves,  for our selfless acts of wanting to a peruse false sense of comfort or achievement. 
But brain cells can't determine right from wrong when under demonic medical treatment 
So it's a burden when you have to learn to think with it... 
(Ep.4)
His mother had kicked him out at a young age
For he was the man who was crazed and bottled up multiple types of rage 
Multiple types of personalities from his various experiences in his psychedelic cage 
The man who held a man at gunpoint but only to disengage
He had seen no end to ""this"" chapter of his life, like if he was stuck, forever, on this page
(Ep.5)
Out of all the places he wasn't welcome, there was a little family owned restaurant that was near
After hearing ""get out"" for years he was surprised that his ears didn't pick up that familiar sound he feared 
The restaurant was called ""Mi Tierra"" and he was hesitant to come in even though from where he stood it said ""entra"" 
...
The costumer service served more than just his cup of tea, it was his cup of tea
He was approached by a beautiful blonde woman who he and never seen
Nervous excitement filled up within him because for the first time in years someone comes up to him 
""How can it be?"" Thinking ""Do I just ignore her"" 
Can't help but to shake his leg, you can hear the dimes and quarters
She finally stands in front of him, and she sees through the many years of pain in his eyes and the attitude he hides, the attitude you learn from living in the border
She finally speaks to him and says ""may I take your order?"" 
(Ep.6)
...during his young years as a rebellious teenager
Through the bad habits pressured by peers and strangers 
The gift of music came out from the depths of what the civility of the town considered a danger 
He was in a band that played classic rock with his friends around the block 
Once they blew up and started doing gigs around the clock for hours on end, his ambition for music never stopped
His fingers would fiddle like a flute player on the stings 
He was the talk of the town and the ladies would drown themselves when he sings 
He would eventually fall into the lyrics he would sing as a hobby but will later be used as his demonic preachings using symphonic melodies

7,"I've put off getting my license for a long time now because I have a hard time driving. I'm having one problem in specific and I'm not sure if it's normal or not. 

My problem is that I can't for the life of me keep track of the space that my car takes. This mostly makes it hard for me to park. Wether I'm backing in or doing it normally, I can't tell at all how close I am to the line. I also can't tell how close the passenger side is to the line. Like, at all. 

I thought it would be really easy to do. The first time I tried parking I was really confident but when I got out and looked at what I had done, not only was I parked slightly diagonally, I was roughly five feet out of the parking space and partially into adjacent space. Me and my dad tried again and again to get it right but it never got better. 

My parents seem to not even think twice about this. They just *know* how much space they're taking. I don't know how they do it. I don't like it, though, because I constantly have to be looking at the mirrors to check if I'm in my lane and that's a lot of time where I should be looking ahead. 

edit: I'm honestly considering biking everywhere lol. I like riding my bike, so why not? It'd be a lot easier. Maybe. ",05May2017,4

I worked my ass off for my final project, but the critique did not go very well. It was a shitty way to end my college career, especially since I poured every ounce of my energy into this project. And I won't get another chance. Soon I'll be stuck in an office as a CAD monkey, and any opportunities for true creativity and design will disappear.

12,"More specifically, I've never really had my own place, except for a few months when I was 19 and tried to be an adult with a friend of mine. We ended up getting evicted, and there was never a couch.

Lived with my girlfriend in a couple of apartments, but never in our name and never for more than a year. Been living with her parents for the last 10+ years, so we pretty much have our bedroom, and our kid has his room. There's a couch, but it isn't mine.

Have started the process of looking for a house. Rebuilt my credit from a shitty 300-something 10 years ago to a decent low 700s. Finally making enough money where I can walk into the bank and confidently know I will be approved for a loan. Pre-qualification was a breeze and it felt great.

Got a little money saved up. I'm sure it isn't nearly as much as /r/personalfinance would like me to have, but it will work.

14,"Lately, I've been ask more frequently, when are you getting married? When are you having children? 

Why do others think that being single is not good enough? I'm single, but that doesn't mean that I'm alone; I have companionship, friends, and family. Just like getting married and having children is a choice, so is being single. I don't appreciate when others try to impose their beliefs in this matter on me; if I wanted to be married with children, then I would be or at least working towards that goal. It's not like if I haven't thought of this path; but after serious consideration, I have decided not to pursue this path, I will revisit this in the far future, but for now, I'm happy being single. 

Don't get me wrong; I have nothing against marriage or children; more power to those who choose this path and work to make it stronger. However, I don't like the way society makes me feel about being single, like if something is wrong with me. Why must I have a child to be happy? Why must I be marry to be considered responsible and dependable? Why do some look and treat me with pity, as if I have nothing in my life? 

I am a hard working, responsible, and dependable individual; I have goals and dreams to conquer; I take responsibility for my choices and the paths I take in life. When am I going to...? When I am done living my life the way I want to live it; when I am satisfied with my goals; when I have traveled and visited the places I want. 

Marriage and children are a commitment; that requires devotion and hard work. Before I even consider that path, I need to have that same commitment and devotion to make myself happy, healthy and strong. 

When am I going to...? When I am good and ready! So stop asking me. ",05May2017,2

19,"About a year ago, I was obsessive over the game despite the competitive mode not being out yet—I grinded McCree in QP for hours every day. So here I was, playing as usual, when I get added to a group that was on my team. The leader messaged me saying I was a good McCree and they wanted to queue with me, and I was alright with it.

We start talking. The group leader is a girl, my age, soft spoken. We chat a little bit, but after a while of playing with these people I eventually stop talking to them, especially once my tryhardedness peaks and I'm too busy worrying about my Top500 ranking to play with people in a lower skill bracket. In due time, though, I burn out on the game and stop playing.

Flash forward several months. Going through old Discord messages, I find her again, and strike up a conversation. We talk a lot, and start casually playing games together again. We slowly form a really strong bond, as we shared a background of depression and anxiety. I had recovered from the worst of those feelings a few years ago, while she had just gotten through the worst of it and things were still looking bleak, so I gave her all the support I could.

One night, she messages me, telling me that she loves me. At first, I don't realize what's happening, and just reply ""thanks"" because I'm clueless. She asks if I love her back, and I reflect upon all that's happened, before finally saying yes.

Things progress, and I realize just how intense her feelings are for me. She is constantly telling me that she loves me, and I'm constantly doing the same.

Despite living 12h away from me, we make it work. Other opportunities are bringing her nearby for a day or two in a week weeks, so we're going to meet. I'm so excited, and it's been all I can think about.

24,"I guess from a very basic overview my life isn't horrible. I'm graduating from Berkeley this May (was under the impression that I'd be lucky to graduate from high school). I have a boyfriend who cares for me a lot and friends who like me. I have a roof over my head, food to eat, a bank account, credit, a minimum wage job just to make ends meet before finding a real job, family that is helping me by housing me. My family is broken, but we try and keep it together in whatever way we can. I used to go to church a lot, was even part of a lot of the undergraduate leadership. Now I'm not so sure. I have a lot of questions for God and holy shit why life even has to be like this at all.
beneath all of that, I lost my best friend from childhood because she felt that a lot of toxic stuff surfaced from our friendship. And long story short she felt that our friendship existed solely for me. She never told me during our friendship, until she froze me out and cut me out of her life after we went away for different colleges. I'm introverted so I never saw the need to keep many friends, as long as I had one good one. And I feel like no matter how I tried to mend the friendship, it was already gone for her. It made me question who I am as a person, maybe I'm so manipulative that I'm actually lying and victimizing myself -- which is all highly likely. My family tells me that all of the time. Which is why when I flipped out at my sister (who is housing me during the time I'm in my last semester in school and trying to find a job) because she doesn't think about my time and I felt taken advantage of. (she has a new baby, first time mother. I try and help her when I have time, i love my niece but all three of my finals are on Tuesday and I haven't had any time to work on my papers or anything because I'm always either working, or watching her kid or running errands/doing chores because nothing in life is really free). and she's broken down because she's not only supporting her own family, but my divorced mom (bitter, gambling problem, stubborn in the way that only old people are) and my black sheep sister (involved in an awful car crash, couldn't graduate high school, estranged and abused by our dad the most). I get that my oldest sister (the one taking care of everyone) has it rough. I know too fucking well. She climbed her way out of our shithole impoverished life of domestic abuse and poverty, put herself through school and lives the comfortable middle class life where me and my mom and other sister leeches off of her. I'm not exactly in a position where I can just take care of myself and have no choice but to be her dependent and I'm trying too. I make it a point to never ask her for more than the necessary (occasionally food, and shelter). Even when I have money or health problems I take care of it all by myself because I don't want her to feel like I'm another problem she has to take care of. As soon as I fuck up by not living to her standards (anally neat, but her house her rules), she reminds me that she has all this shit she's done for me and that I'm not in a position to talk back. I fucking get that. I already hate myself so fucking much -- I can easily be my own worst critic and I'm always trapped in my head. Of course her slamming me with guilt and her self pitying doesn't really help (we all have our fucking issues don't we?) I don't know how to let people in, and I feel like I have to keep people at arm's distance to keep myself from breaking so much that I don't even know who I am anymore. There isn't a single fucking day where I don't beg God to erase my existence instead of killing me because I'm a fucking coward (what drives me insane is that I found out two days ago when my oldest sister was 11 my mom asked her if she wanted a little sister. she said yes on a whim and later asked what would have happened if she had said no. My mom said she was going to abort me because she wasn't sure if she could handle another child LOL how ironic). And looking at all of this makes me cringe because I'm writing as my head bounces from one thought to another and it all makes sense in my head and I feel like I looked at this at all of the angles that I can see, but what if I'm missing something so glaringly obvious, or that because I feel like I get everything, and that I can analyze it in my head so well like clockwork that I'm not properly explaining it now, when all I really need is an outlet where people can just hear me with minimal fear of rejection. I oscillate between looking at one way plane tickets and emergency loans, and ways to painlessly kill yourself without burdening others (kind of impossible, but what is the most minimal way? I guess the people who succeeded wouldn't be able to say). i wish i could say the world is bigger than this 35 mile radius I kind of live around, but at this point I don't see why that matters.

31,"There is a great delusion in our world. Consider the case of a relationship between two persons, widely assumed to be based upon two persons experiencing each other. The contrary idea is that each of the two people is perceiving themself and the other person, so there are 4 perceived, or experienced individuals - Person 1's self-perception, Person 1's perception of person 2, Person 2's self perception and Person 2's perception of person 1.

I was hoping you could provide me with some advice on how to better handle a problem with myself that I encounter frequently, especially during conversations with my girlfriend.

If I hear something that might bother me or upset me, I begin to immediately close myself off and feel as if I'm shutting down and a  ""sinking"" feeling flows over me. I personally feel this is due to the fact that I don't know what to say in the moment as a response and to avoid saying something I would regret in any way, I decline to say anything at all and give off a very negative vibe. This in itself is often a lot worse than the actual situation itself and ends up making the situation a bigger deal than it needs to be. It isn't until sometime after that I am able to convey my thoughts and responses in a healthy manner, but by then I've often already upset my partner to the point where the situation seems too far gone. The worst part is that the situations themselves are also very trivial and appear so simple to me after the fact.

Has anyone else experienced a similar problem with themselves and come up with a solution? Does anyone have any helpful advice or insight? Is there anything I should say to her in particular? I've tried to explain how I feel to her, but it doesn't come out right or it's after we have a disagreement and she doesn't want to talk about it. I'm getting so frustrated with myself and I don't know what to do.

50,"This is going to sound weird or even sadistic but I can assure you that this isn't me REALLY wishing war or anything. 

As a child I lived through the siege of Grozny during the first chechen war, lost my mother and sister, and lived in the city during the siege. Anywhere from 50,000-100,000 people died out of 350,000 living in the city, it was a bloodbath. I can into detail after detail about how bad it was and describe events but that would just take forever. 

I think there are certain emotions and feelings of hatred and anger and misery which the masses of the developed world have never felt. There is a whole SPECTRUM of human emotion that is so extreme and so powerful, yet so much of this world has never felt it. The feeling of watching an innocent person die right in front of you. The feeling of realizing you are stuck in a situation with no hope in sight. The feeling of finding out your mother is dead or that your friends apartment was hit by a missile. When you people see something unfair, typically on a video or something, and you feel this... rage in the pit of your stomach. A video of an innocent person getting beaten is a good example, people often get that feeling from that. I am sure you know what I mean, that feeling of absolute disgust and rage and anger at the response to seeing such insane injustices. That is what it was like, but every single day. Just constantly feeling that, on a scale that people in the first world cannot comprehend. These are feelings that so, so many people around the world feel or have felt, yet in the first world they are pushed to the back of our minds, seen almost as a foreign concept. This doesn't exactly apply to those living in Americas violent inner cities, they have seen atrocities as well which would make the average europeans head spin. I live in NYC now, just for everyone to know. 

But sometimes, when I see people witnessing or even experiencing that level of pain it makes me happy. Like I really cannot describe it. It gives me a little rush of excitement to see a white wealthy couple witness atrocities in syria on TV, it gives me a rush to see some yuppie get robbed and mugged in a hood he shouldnt have walked through. I love seeing threads on reddit where people talk about how horrible war is on like a photo album or something. I watch videos of people reacting to 9/11 on the streets and it gives me this feeling of rush and excitement, almost like they are finally experiencing the pain and suffering and chaos that I and so many others felt. Hell, when 9/11 happened and I saw the pluming towers I felt that feeling, as horrible as that may sound. 

I am not sure why I feel these feelings. Its a very specific feeling honestly. I dont know if anyone else who has been through war has felt these feelings, but I know I feel it a lot.

51,"Spring/Summer is some real bullshit. I get my allergy shots, take my Zyrtec, eyedrops, and cough drops, but it's still terrible.


The weather is great outside after a week of non-stop raining and flooding where I live but I honestly can't even go outside for 10 seconds without breaking out into a coughing fit. It raises my blood pressure and makes it hard to breathe. Sometimes it's bad enough that I throw up from coughing so hard or my chest convulses a bit...


Tomorrow is my college graduation. I don't have a job and haven't started applying or studying for grad school yet, so I'm just stuck at home all day.


I really hate this time of year. Anyone else out there suffering just as bad?",05May2017,3
52,"I don't have a ton of time right now, but I am fourteen and going though some social/ mental problems right now and want to talk to someone who might be able to understand and provide advice.

Edit : Okay I have a bit of time now( I am on mobile so sorry for spelling and formatting). I am in 8th grade right now, and going though some things. First of all I am very ADD, and self diagnosed Aspgers. I aslo think I may sociopathic, but I will explain that later. I guess I have been going through some identity crisis stuff I guess. First of I am very smart. It's not opnion, it's fact. I often am scored at 99% in standerized test, many times getting in the top 100 people in the state for math, science and sometimes literally analysis. Actually, let's jump back to when I was younger. All though elementary school ( primary I think) I pretty much had only one ""freind"". I put the quotes because everyday when I would go to school, I wouldn't know if I would have one freind or one bully. But that was normal for me. I dident know any better. Cut to sixth grade. My only friend is still my only friend, but he is constantly my friend now. But I didn't like who he was associating himself with.(trouble makers). So when I started to semi diversify by finding a person who I worked well with, then pretty much forced them to include me in their group so I am not liked, and barely talked to if at all, I was still happier than I was in middle School. Que the beginning of 7th grade. I am better liked in the group but still distant. At this point I am in a new group and knew nothing on how to interact in social situations. I wanted to get close to them but I was so untrusting of putting my trust in people that it was hard. In the middle of that year I was in a study hall with someone named Isabella . From what I remember we clicked pretty early on, and we lived near each other so we would walk home together. This advanced our freind ship the fastest one has ever been for me. At the end of the year I kept getting more and more distant from my friend group, that I was adopted into persay. Or vise versa. One memory in particular is the school going on a field trip, and me counting the amount of words said directly to me. It was 7. Seven words over 7 hours. From my main freind group. At this point I still had a very small circle if one at all. Now the summer before eighth grade. I ended up falling for Isabella that summer, even with no interaction. Now eighth grade. When school started, I had a lot of classes with Isabella, and was starting to diversify more. I am still horrible in social situations. My friend group ended up splitting up, and I moved to a friend group where I had some connections, as well as some members of my past freind group. At this point I am still getting increasingly close to Isabella as we are still walking around. She was, and is the one person who knows the most about me. The thought that I was sociopathic started this year. It all lines up to me. I don't really feel happy or sad or anything like that. Idk how to describe it. But what I do know is that I can only feel really strong feelings. My love for Isabella faded for a while untill around Valentine's day, but I will get to that. So at about halfway through the year,  I switched freind groups again and moved to Isabellas. I am getting better at integration, but still very bad at everything social. Probably due to lack of experience. (I was typing while walking home, and hit save before I got to internet access so I may have forgetten some stuff) So anouther thing is I am a big snowboarder. I think it is such a big thing for me becuase it allows me to strip off the facade of my ADD medicie, and the facade of the calm laid back person that I am at school and home and allow me to go all out. It also allows me to get rid of massive amounts of stress. Stress that usally takes a whole year to be built up. I can normally tell when I am getting to the breaking point. It also allows me to be dangours, dance with death if you will. So back to the middle of the year. I am doing pretty well in school, I am in highschool math, and two advaced classes. I have pretty much all a's. At the begging of the year, I suffered a break down. I was getting so pissted off that I almost couldent controll my self. And if I ever get to the point where I cant control myself, people are going to get hurt. I am 150 pounds, 5'10"" ish, and have almost no fat on me, despite playing video games for at least 2 hours a day. I could probally take down 98 or 97 percent of the school. And that scares me. But anyway. Oh anouther thing. I have to run every night or else I cant fall asleep untill 2 or 3 in the morning. It has been that way since 7th grade. Anyway, valentins day. I end up buying a sucker or her (I know, gentalmanly) and just leaving it anoymus. To gauge her reation? IDFK why. Nothing happened from that. Cut to late march. We have gotten to the point where we will walk outside of walking home. It is a sunday night. That friday, I end up seeing cuts on her wrist. Now I have heard her say she did stuff like that, but I always took it as a joke. I shouldent have looking back, but I did. I confront her, she admits it. The next peroid she writes a letter talking about trust and stuff, and that it will take time to totally trust me and stuff. That satury she texts and says she want me to talk to one of her freinds, I say okay, and he doest text. Untill that sunday night. I have no idea what she told him, but I am assuming that it is that she likes me. So we walk back to our homes, and I am still texting her freind. I cant remember the conversation perfectly but I basicly said that I liked her, and shared that with her and shared that she likes me, with me. At this point I cant really remember what I was saying to both her, and him but we knew we both liked each other. So we sorta become something more. Not exactly dating, not exactly freinds. But close. Before now I had only liked one other person (that I know of. Like I said sociopath) and only for like 3 days before it faded. All it really was, was heavy flirting that type of stuff. But then a week later she said something along the lines of "" I dont like the way you like me"" or something. I'm like okay, understanable, I saw that I get pretty over protective of people I care about, and this is the first time I have really cared about someone before. Ever. Then spring break happens, and she and one other freind invite me to walk, and im like sure, I will try and repair a freindship that was the one I had put the most trust into. I end up not getting talked to, and that really jsut messes with me, becuase it brings me back to much worse times. I storm off. Now cut to a few weeks ago. I have sorta repaired our freind ship but idk. (Oh and also track has started 5 days a week so we arent walking home anymore). I am with my older brother and his fiance and for some reason end up texting her something about, how I am seeing them and missing human interaction or something like that, and it ends up kickstarting our conversation again. At that point we somehow get to talking about each other, and basicly say that we still like each other, but she says that... well I cant really remember what. Anyway we get back to the flirty stuff. A little later in the week she says that she doest want to hurt me, or lost me or something, and that if i knew all of her secrents I would hate her. (Which I wouldent, she is basicly the only person I trust, and could never) I took it a lot better this time, and were still freinds. This was very recent. Now over the past couple of days, both she and I have been sorta flity, and I really dont know whats happening. Serosly why cant people just say what they are thinking? So to the main point. Over the past couple of days I been having problems with who I am. I have built a wall around myself to block everything out so early, and built it so strong I am not even sure I can penitrate it. I know I am very good at what I do, but have been feeling like I am useless. I have been feeling like nothing is fun anymore. I have been making stupid mistakes in everything I do. I feel like I need to get out and go snowboarding, release stress. But I cant. Its spring where I live. Ummm. yeah. I am not sure where I was going with this.",05May2017,5
53,"I have been on an anti-psychotic for two months now and have not once thought that I hate myself or that I want to die.  This used to be a daily occurrence for me, not a single day did I not think this.  I knew they were delusions but it was always there, regardless of how much I tried to not think of this.  It has been gone, it is like freaking magic.

When I was young I was so anti-medication that it blows my mind how much they can help now. I thought mental illness was an excuse, that it was just a mental weakness. I was just in absolute denial there was anything wrong with me. 

When I was 5 I thought it would go away in time.
When I was 15 I thought it would go away in time.
When I was 25 it wasn't getting better.  I broke. 
I got an anti-depressant.  It worked okay but was never enough. 
 I got counseling and it was never enough.
When I was 28 my doctor realized my symptoms were that of bipolar II.  He started trying to find an anti-psychotic that would work.  We went through so many and nothing worked that didn't cause side effects that were worse than the thoughts. FINALLY two months ago we found one that works with no side-effects, besides headaches which I always get.  I can't stop thinking about the difference it has made for me.  I NEVER thought something would relieve the imbalances in my brain.  People would tell me it will get better and I would not believe it. And at last some relief!  

I am not telling you medication is the way or that this can be cured.  My mental illness will be with me the rest of my life, but with a little help I can let it not control me.  Yes, I will probably falter and have awful times again but I will do my best to not let them destroy me.  

I always think about the quote from Stephen Chbosky, ""please believe that things are good with me, and even when they're not, they will be soon enough. And i will always believe the same about you.""",05May2017,13
56,"I know she's fourteen years old. I knew this was going to happen eventually. But she acts so young and has so much energy that it had deceived me into feeling like there could be many more years.

An email from the vet this morning, with the results of her senior blood work, changed all of that. Stage three renal failure. I guess she has started peeing more, but really, she's shown very few signs that anything was wrong.

She's sitting by me, trying to comfort me as I cry. That's been her entire life. Me. She knows my exact moods. She's been my shadow for my entire adult life. I have never known a dog so good and well behaved and smart and gentle.

I don't know how to process this. I have a feeling the next few months are going to pass far too quickly. She has spent her whole life showing me how much she loves me, but how am I ever supposed to properly reciprocate that? I'm not ready for this. I'll never be ready for this.

She's such a good girl...

59,"So I did acid for the first time recently - ended up doing 3 tabs and had a lovely time staying up all night reflecting and whatnot - by 8am we find out that our ex stepdad died 

He was a man who hurt our mother severely: emotionally and financially; which led her to have a near drinking problem whilst she sorted out her life and due to the money he 'borrowed' and never repaid - had to work 3 jobs and do all sorts of hard grafting work to afford our house
As a result of him, our family friend (whom I was on the phone to as his child was born) tried to molest my sister: he failed but the police were never called and I'm sure it's something my mother feels guilty over constantly. His cousins lived next door and were violent cokehead dealers who smashed a woman's head on a car bonnet a few times. Their rivals tried to firebomb them but got our house instead: he didn't even ask for an apology due to his fear of them and escapist reality where he smoked way too much weed (I smoke habitually but the reasons he smoked were a crutch rather than just relief) 
His mother planned a sleepover for his daughter the same day as my mother's birthday: he went to the sleepover obviously. The man himself used to call me and my sister fat all the time, was a small minded racist/homophobe, and mooched off people - he also had a bastard son he rarely visited (I'm assuming because he's heavily autistic) 

Obviously though I feel immense empathy for the family, especially the mother who has to bury her son, his friends, his daughter - Christ I don't revel in his death either: but this is a point of immense closure and symbolic for my family and I as it shows how much we've gone through and changed 

I won't say I never cared for the man - because he was a father figure: whilst I rejected it on one level because I still know my father even though he lives upcountry - he was a part of my formulative life and even on a base level he cared. I tried to touch a soldering iron once and he screamed to stop me, so I won't attest that he hated me nor will I vilify him to an extreme extent 

End of the day: his idiosyncrasies were innately him and I won't lie, we now suspect he had autism because he was a very particular person and honestly I don't think meant any harm - just had a small worldview and was socially odd 
Doesn't take away that he directly and indirectly hurt my family - but I won't shit on his grave because I don't want to hold any malice there anymore 

 But today finally feels like closure from a part of my life that was challenging for me and my family, and pushed us back many steps as people 

That's all ",05May2017,3
60,"This probably belongs in r/leaves, but I feel weird posting this there for some reason. Probably because I feel like I have intentions to start smoking again and that's against the rules. 


I stopped smoking sometime in mid March...I completely forgot to write down when, and have a fucked up sense of time so I dunno when exactly. I've been smoking pot heavily for roughly five years with little to no breaks in those five years. My ex got me started and was miserable to be around unless he was high, so we rarely went without pot ever. I would have panic attacks when we were running out of bud and my sleep quality suffered because I stopped dreaming, even if we had really good shit that knocked me on my ass! It was awful. It stopped being fun and I started dreading it but that didn't stop me. Then one day after I started packing a bowl in my bong, I decided to stop smoking all together. I took one hit, instantly regretted it, and haven't really thought about it for a while. I cleaned all of my pipes and my two bongs and sewed little covers to keep the dust out of them and so I didn't see them very often. I think this is one of the only reasons I haven't smoked in so long. I think about doing it a lot but I haven't really wanted to until today! I was upset at first because I had just knit a new lighter cozy in black to keep on my bong so I always knew where my lighter was/so people couldn't walk off with it.


A few days ago, I broke down and packed a bowl and just stared at it for a while...before unpacking it and putting my bong back into storage in my closet. I'm afraid that if I smoke even a little, I'll stop having dreams again. But I still want to because I really enjoy smoking. Cigarettes make me sick so I don't smoke those, but also I have asthma so I shouldn't be putting nasty things into my lungs! Everyone I know is cool with pot and I feel they don't understand what I'm going through. I've been avoiding certain people because all we would do together is smoke. They haven't noticed.


Today, I really want to smoke. I don't know why, or what is is about today. It started last night, for some reason when I was cooking dinner I wanted to smoke while I was waiting on something to be finished. Sometimes I want to smoke because of how much it helps with my eating disorder but I don't think it's worth it. I want to be able to pass a drug test without having anxiety about failing, and I want to be able to have a clear head and just enjoy things without getting stoned out of my gourd first. But damn, it's so tempting to just try it again and see what'll happen this time. It doesn't help that my dad smokes and is constantly talking about it.


To replace the constant smoking and packing of bowls, I've started to knit again. It's so cathartic. A plus is my clothing and knitting projects stopped reeking of pot constantly, which has also improved my moods and my anxiety levels! Apparently, habitual use of pot can mess with your anxiety more than it can fix it. Been reading a lot about that. Plus, natural cannabinoids exist to regulate your body's PH level so I can't imagine the damage I've already done to my brain or body from oversaturating those cannabinoids with ones from pot.


Sorry for being so long-winded, I doubt anyone will read this but it feels nice to get it out there.",05May2017,205
61,"I woke up laughing out loud, and wrote down the dream immediately. I have used the exact wording and imagery from my dream, so in a way, I would consider this a non-creative work, more of a recording. Many of my dreams have a person narrating to me, explaining what is going on. In this case, it was a nondescript grand-daughter. 

Here is the dream: 

My Grandmother is not a very good person. One day, we learned that my Grandfather had refused to appear with her in public, or make any personal sacrifices that might advance her career. Grandfather is an extremely skinny, wrinkly, tall old man, and when angry he reverts to his foreign accent.

“I wanta sex change. A sexa change equal all da power. Alsways, I play the second fiddle, but now, I shalla be the queen too. Who say there can be only one queen?”

Grandfather sunk into his chair, kicked out his feet, and his wrinkled face imploded into more wrinkles. Maybe he had a point. Why shouldn’t he have a little taste of the power?

My grandmother had heard the whole rant. She was hanging out around the corner. Now she sprang out. She isn’t a very good person.

“I’ve had it with all of you,” she said matter of factly, pointing at me for some reason. “I’m disenfranchising you all. You want my fame, but it’s aaaaaallll mine.”

But could she do it? 

Yes, she had a plan. Somehow, she had got herself a toddler. No one knows how, but it was all completely legal. He was a little Mexican boy named Alfonso.

“I heard that Mexico is taking over America, and it has always been my dream to grab America, so Alfonso is worth more than all of you.”

“That’s horrible, Gran,” said William. Until now,  William had always hoped to be known as William the Conqueror, and everyone knew it. But as the saying goes: There can’t be two conquerors in one family.

“The only thing you’ve ever conquered was…” Alfonso zinged William a good one, and hopped on his bike and rode off. I guess Alfonso must have been four, I haven’t known many three-year-olds to take off like that without training wheels. 

You do realize, by the way, that my grandmother has multiple grandchildren, not just William and the soulless one. She had more than one child. Princess Diana wasn’t her only child.

Grandmother had her plans, and they all involved violence. She isn’t a good person. Mostly, I think her plan involved attack dogs. Mostly Yorkies. She’s gone off of Corgies, since one of the last ones peed on the Magna Carta. It was only trying to show its support for the divine rights of the monarchy, but the PR stunt went bad, and that was that.

Now, none of us have any money any more. Grandmother had adopted Alfonso, so he precedes all us grandchildren, in regards to getting the dough.

Last thing I knew, my Grandmother  was dressed up something like how a current pop-star imagines an eighties punk-rocker ought to look, and she was riding a tank over the Rio Grande. ",05May2017,2
62,"A few days ago I used his phone to get the free Uber you can get from using a promo code, to get the free trip you need to provide a working payment method so I used my moms paypal as I intended to log out so I didn't think it would be an issue and I didn't realise his phone was on low battery as it died just after we requested the uber

The next day he used the account for an uber and I spoke to him about it and he apologised saying he thought it was free because he gave out his code to another person and he thought that gave him another free trip. I accepted his apology and asked him not to do it again and he said ""yhyh""

I tried to delete the uber account but Uber's shit customer service replied with a blank message!

Today I had 2 more Uber's took out of my moms paypal and he is denying they were him despite the fact that one was to the same road he lives on and the other was from the same road he lives on

I'm 99% sure it's him however I don't really know what to do as I don't really have another group of friends and I'm supposed to be going on a holiday with them in a few weeks.

I really don't want to make a huge issue out of it as if I lose my only group of friends I'm scared I will fall into depression again (which happened last time I cut off a group of friends)
