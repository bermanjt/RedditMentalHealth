12,"Dear reddit,

I'm sorry I drove with my high beams on for so long. A couple weeks ago, when I asked you about this in /r/internetparents, you unequivocally informed me that this was not okay. Many of you told me that I was a threat to other drivers on the road, and a few of you castigated me, even going so far as to infer that I were intellectually challenged.

Since my regular headlights barely illuminated the road in front of me, I felt that I was justified to use my high beams. In my mind, relying on my exceptionally dim headlights was much more dangerous than putting on my high beams.

Regardless, I am sorry to tell you that I did not heed your advice. I did not lock away the keys to my vehicle and rely solely on Uber and public transportation for the next two weeks. I did not attempt to replace the headlights myself because, frankly, I know very little about cars and I probably would not have been able to figure out how to put my car back together. Instead, I waited two weeks for the service appointment at my dealership and continued to drive with my high beams on.

The service appointment was today. I told the service advisor about my faint headlights, that they hardly light up the road ahead of me. She was confused, then asked to enter the vehicle. I allowed her. She flicked the controls back and forth.

""Hm, well, your headlights are working just fine,"" she informed me.

""What? They may be working fine now, but it's broad daylight. If it were nighttime, you would see that it's patently unsafe to drive with those dim headlights! That I am required by circumstance to drive with my high beams on!""

""No,"" she said, chuckling to herself. ""You see, when you have the controls flicked away from you, it activates the fog lights, not the headlights. However, if you flick the controls *toward* you, then it activates your headlights. That's all you need to do.""

I thanked her very much and we had a laugh over how I had been driving like this for over a year, just because I didn't know there was a toggle between headlights and fog lights.

Lesson learned, reddit. But I wish you hadn't been so cruel and weird about it. There are a lot worse things you can do on the road than drive with your high beams on. The moral of this story is that people make mistakes, and that it's better to go after the assholes on the road than to go after people who are honestly just confused and unsure what they're doing wrong.

So one night in August when I just turned 15 and was about start my second week of freshman year in high school.  After a summer of warming up to the idea that being Trans wasn't that bad, with a growing desire to be female, it felt like a train of emotions hit when for whatever reason a trans joke sent me searching for what I would want my name to be if I was a woman. 

When I found a name, I went into the bathroom room and looked at the mirror and said to myself, ""Holy shit. I think I may be trans.""

The week that followed I slowly began to put together my transition plan. I originally planned to start a full transition in college. It would be perfect, I would be with new people so making a new identity would be easy and I don't have the burden of my family who have admittedly not the most accepting of views of trans people. If only surviving high school with a deep secret you couldn't take your mind off of was easy. A year I said to my self thinking that one year with a secret would be survivable. Then the depression came. 

I lost my motivation for school and my grades suffered. Whenever one of my parents would mention my grades I would nearly have a panic attack. I knew that I could wait. I needed to come clean. I slowly worked up the nerve to tell my mom about my desire. When it came time simply saying the line ""l want to be female"" was like trying to shit out a brick covered in chipotle peppers, but after a long internal war it finally came out. I was a little surprised with how my mom wasn't shocked with that news. As if she knew this day would come. 

My mom researched it a bit and saw that it is common for boys with a mental condition I previously had to have a desire to be female so she found me a therapist. (Let's call the therapist Doc). When I met with Doc he was really helpful in trying to go through the possible reasons other than mental feminization that I could want to do this. Even though I was finally getting help my depression continued to worsen. 

I still had appointments with Doc to tell him a bit more. Still I became more and more depressed. Last weeks dips where that weeks normals. It began to look hopeless. Then something miraculous happen. 

I began growing my hair out just in case so I wouldn't have to wait 6 months to have a female hair style. One day when I looked in the mirror I saw a female face. I was hit with another emotion train. This one was happiness. The depression began to lift as I finally had a break from school.  As the depression left my memory came back. I had major revaluations. 

I soon realized that since I was 8 I wanted to be a girl, but I never admitted to myself till that one August night. My parents made so many jokes about me liking girly things that I felt like I need to prove to myself that I didn't want to be a girl. When I learned that it was possible to change your gender when I was about 11, I became so excited, but I soon learned about the political side of it which with the previous self denial put me in check for 3 years. Throughout the time I always still felt like something was off about myself. When I was 10 I even once wondered if I originally was a girl. Along with this I went through every possible social problem that may cause me to want to be female and found none valid. There was no better explanation for the desire other that it just felt right almost as if I was supposed to be a woman. 

I was so happy to finally have an explanation for my desire and that off feeling that I had for the past 7 years my life. After review my life I could possibly see my life continue with me being male and I wanted to start the transition immediately. I feel kind of bad for my mom as I think she still thinks that I am undecided. Plus I doubt any parent wants to hear that they have a belated daughter. 

Now I sit hear in my bed after wearing a dress I made from a pillow case (best 15 minutes of my life) waiting to tell doc my final decision. 

I feel nice to write it all out and know someone will know the full story. Still building up the nerve to tell my friends and I can't wait for my day in hell when I go to school in woman's clothes for the first time. I would enjoy your opinion and what you think about my situation. ",15Jan2017,5

29,"We've been there for each other for over a year, when we met we both had gotten out of serious relationships. 
A few months after constant talking, we started seeing each other and have been doing so for like 9 months. We have this thing where we don't 'catch feelings' and it's become some pride thing. Whoever admits it first, loses. It's kinda stupid. 
I've been having a difficult time at home and I've felt like no one ever reciprocates anything I do. I go miles for people and they can't take two steps for me. Anyways, this lead to me getting angry with him. Since whenever we organise to meet up a little early, he's always late by two hours or so, or he's never ready. Yesterday I was excited to see him early and I did put a lot of effort into getting ready. And he wakes up two hours after we were supposed to meet. 
I didn't go see him. But met him later in the afternoon to get my stuff. He calls me shortly after asking what was up. And I told him no one appreciates the effort I put in and that I don't think I'd be seeing him again, he said he understood although it's pretty crap.
A few hours later I felt bad and asked him if he wanted to talk. He said yes. So we're speaking again. 
I just don't know what to do now. 
We aren't together but it's like I'm already committed to him (he doesn't know that I don't see anyone but him) that's just how I am, I only need one person to put all my effort towards. I have other options but it's just not the same. ",15Jan2017,3

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5o1ovy/with_only_days_until_donald_trump_takes_office/) is what prompted me to write this, but honestly I've been feeling this way for a while.

My family is very conservative, and specifically my mother has always said ""why should we be afraid of surveillance if we have nothing to hide?"" What really scares me is the fact that, if this had been 13+ years ago, I could be arrested for having sex (I'm gay). Until 5 years ago, I couldn't serve in the military.

Of course, if I keep it all private then none of that won't happen, right? Don't ask, don't tell. Except, if these laws exist in twenty years, I won't have the right to privacy. So who knows what else I will be doing in ""privacy"" that's illegal? The civil rights movement and the gay rights movement only succeeded because privacy existed. What will be the next issue in twenty years? Imagine how many more black people would have been killed if these surveillance laws had been in place back then?

33,"I live in the United states, I'm a working artist and my relationship with my fiancee is winding down. I feel it is, but I can tell he is kinda clueless.

One of the factors of my schizophrenia is that I can get so severely depressed that philosophically, I feel so low that I don't even feel like killing myself. Like I deserve whatever hell I'm deluded into feeling my life has become, so I'm content to sentence myself to still living, cause, heck, my friends are still here, the food is decent when I cook it and I live a bus ride from my favorite thriftshop to flip from and walking distance to my favorite makeup shop. Doesn't that sort of depression sound kinda paradoxical? Maybe like I'd been listening to too much Lana Del Rey?

I digress.

I studio with a wealthy middle aged lady who I admire greatly. We'd gotten rather close as friends, she is a major donor to my gallery. I'm also friends with her young adult musician daughters. I got invited to the older daughters deejay set at a restaurant where the food was delicious, but painfully rich and hipster. Think cereal battered popcorn chicken, sweet potato tots with everything, delicious Brussels sprouts made terribly unhealthy. I rarely drink, but I'd had like 2 overpriced, pretty creative cocktails and the shot everyone at our table had. I'd also made the mistake of having a couple of hits off a weed vape my gal gave me, cause I can get pretty socially anxious. 

I'd realized my friend the deejay, in her early 20's was spinning all 90s music from my childhood. 2 drinks in I'd started realizing I had at least a 12 year age difference with most of the restaurant goers. They weren't listening to or jamming out to the music as sincerely as I was. In fact, they seem to be mocking it. This kinda crushed me. Like I'm some kind of an eternal urkel cause I refuse to ""do"" sarcasm. It's confusing, and even worse, boring. I was also sad because the giant bewigged orange tantrum baby is about to take the mantle as leader of the free world.
I was also paranoid of taking too much of the shared food from the table. Having twice been homeless, I can rarely control how much I eat, sometimes resulting in stuffing myself to sickness.

The music is gorgeous, I admire the deejays selections, but can't help but wonder if she's mocking it too. Right then, despite my laughter and musical joy, I go depressed, but as always, I'm brilliant at hiding it behind too much makeup and lots of false bravado. I'm sad that we live in a groovy world full of nice, fabulous, unique, creative things. I got depressed knowing we may head towards a new dark age soon. I'm depressed knowing that I'm gonna have to go homeless again for a few months once I leave him, but I keep putting it off, because, well, let me just stay here and enjoy this a little longer? Right now I'm getting wistful just watching him sleep and knowing in a few months I'll be alone, right?

I can't relate into this, I'm the black sheep among them.

Then about two months ago I got depression bad enough that I had to take the year out of university and I've been at home for a while.

51,"I'm venting here.

I'm not happy with my job. I have only worked at this place since the week before Thanksgiving. I liked it the first few weeks. Now, I wake up every morning thinking of a reason to not go in. I always want to call out. It takes soo much for me to stay til 5pm everyday.

The first week of December I was sick so I stayed home for 3 days (had the flu and there was no way I was going in even though I had only worked there for like 2 weeks). The CEO gave me shit for missing 3 days when I just started the job. She even called me the third day I was out to tell me that it was ""unacceptable."" ...Like I wanted to be laying in bed sick...She asked for a doctor's note (she got it) and wanted to know if I was unhappy and job searching (I wasn't unhappy at the time and no I was def not job searching). 

Anyway, ever since then I become very turned off. OK, it may be normal for people's bosses to act that way but I have never had a boss give me a hard time about being sick and missing work before. In my opinion, wouldn't they rather have their employee at home and not spread the illness? I even offered to work from home those 3 days but the owner of the company doesn't allow that. Hello, it's (or was,) 2016! Get with the times.

There is a girl who started a few days before me and she went on a week vacation after New Years. She came back with a bad cold and the CEO let her leave early. Didn't give her shit about it. That really made me mad because 1. she missed more days than me and 2. the CEO coddled her and was like, ""go home, honey! feel better!""

There are other reasons why I hate my job that actually have to do with the position itself. I am a copywriter for an e-commerce company. My duties are to do their SEO, social media, content writing, and some marketing. This company hardly has any social media following. They ask me for ideas to get more followers and more traffic to the website. I took the initative to make a Power Point presentation for the CEO and Chief of ""E-commerce"" and Marketing Manager (I use quotes because this company is made up of only 10 people and the only person in the e-com dept is me). Anyway, I spent most of my Sunday working on this presentation with great ideas, explanations, and sources to present to them. I told them that one of the most definite ways to gain more followers is by paying for sponsored posts, ads, etc. They said no. Ok fine. And my other ideas? Ignored.

So now I spend my days doing freakin' DATA ENTRY on spreadsheets and writing product descriptions. Every facebook or IG post I make gets 0 engagement. OK I lied, the only people who like the posts are our employees.

I feel like I am wasting my time. I am a talented writer and have started job searching again. Plus, I am kind of living in fear that if I do get sick I won't be able to call out because I will get in trouble. Right now I am dealing with a shitty cold but God forbid I catch something worse (it is winter after all) I will be so afraid to call out.
