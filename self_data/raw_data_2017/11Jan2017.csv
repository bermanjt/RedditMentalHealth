0,I'm looking for a long excuse (paragraphs) as to why I can't catch up with friends on the weekend. So long that they won't bother reading it and I'm off the hook.,11Jan2017,1
1,"And I have a few questions.
I plan on running away because of my mom's retarded behaviour (which I will explain a bit further). I mainly want to know what my mother can do and can't do if I do run away **after** I turn 18 years old on January 30th.

As of right now, I am still in Secondary school but going to an Adult school can't be a problem considering my grades are high. If I do run away, I will have a proper place to stay temporarily and permanently later on.

The reason I say my mom's behaviour is retarded is because she just is. A few weeks ago, we called the cops because her ex boyfriend was stalking her and I as well as harassing our landlord to the point where he almost killed her. The cops *should have* told him to stay away from us and the household itself.

But. This week my mother's behaviour has been weird. She was being passive aggressive when I asked who was calling and was quite mad at me for not going to school due to my sprained ankle.
I woke up by a phone call, which was the one of her ex. She replied but *I think* she said something along the lines of ""He is sleeping, not at school, I'll call you later"". Earlier this night, the same number called and I answered, no one talked. It was the same number.

Normally, he shouldn't call here and I could call the police. But doing that wouldn't help anything. 

My mom **wanted** him to go in prison but now she doesn't want him to. In fact, she doesn't even want to go to the court for that case.

Just now; The same number called. No idea what happened.

Just now^2; I asked her where she was going. ""To hell"", jokingly but that is not her kind of answer.

EDIT: Just now^3; She just left, heading towards where he lives by walk. I'm not saying she's going there, but it's a possibility. 

EDIT^2: She knows I told her I was running away if I saw his face in our house again. Might be why she goes to him, if she does.

TL;DR I want to know if she can do anything *legally* if I do run away as soon as I turn 18 considering I live in the province of Quebec, in Canada.",11Jan2017,3
2,"So [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5n7rtb/his_first_entry_into_his_secret_diary_i_just/) is the number one post on reddit right now. It's cute and innocent and I understand why so many people enjoy it. But it brought back a really old memory that I've never shared in five years on reddit. The post is saturated with comments so I wanted to post it here. 

Me and my mother had a rocky relationship starting when I was about ten years old. There was a lot of arguing and fighting, but I never purposely wanted to hurt my mother and I really did feel bad when she felt bad. Around that age, she started asking for all my online passwords ""just in case"" something happened. Reasonable, but I knew she snooped in all my chats daily with my friends and such and so I moderated my online conversations accordingly. I didn't really have any expectation of privacy there. 

Growing up, I loved writing. I just knew I would be an author one day because of how much I just enjoyed writing. Around eleven, I started keeping a diary. I kept it very, very hidden under my bed so it would never be found. I wrote in that thing for months and months and months. I LOVED that thing. I felt like I could write anything. As time went by, I got sloppy and just began laying it loosely on the floor under my bed. She found it. But yet never said anything specifically. 

But as time went on, I noticed she began ""leading"" conversations. I think she thought I wouldn't catch on. If I mentioned a friend I didn't talk about much in my diary, the next day or two, she'd ask about that specific friend. Or if I mentioned a boy was cute, the next day she'd ask if I had a crush on that specific boy. I think I caught this kind of stuff fairly quickly and quickly became absolutely livid, but I couldn't accuse her because she'd deny it.

Shortly after, I came up with a plan. I took a thin string and wove it together like a very loose knot. Anyone not suspecting such a thing would open the diary and unravel the string and be unable to know how to rearrange it to how it was before. I memorized the pattern of the knot and I think I even drew the pattern somewhere. If you were careful, you could open the book without unravelling it. 

And sure enough, just a day after placing it, the string was completely 100% unwoven and just loosely placed in the diary. My final words in my diary were, ""I hate you, you stupid nosy bitch.""

All the fights we had been in before had come to a head in this moment. Any energy I had ever tried to put into our relationship would probably never be expended again. I loved writing. This felt like the only safe space to where I could be alone with my thoughts, and she ruined it. And there was nothing even ""juicy"" in there and she was reading it daily, and I knew it. I wasn't doing drugs, or making out with random boys, or anything that could have been remotely controversial for an eleven year old. 

I was just blabbing about my day for the most part.

That truly was the turning point for mine and my mother's relationship. After that, I decided she would get the respect a mother needs, but no more. There would be no friendship in the same way me and my father have. No desire to spend time together. That's it. I was done. 

As an adult, my relationship with my mother has largely remained unchanged from that day. Although for a accumulation of experiences through my childhood. I even saw therapy for it and my therapist agreed I did not ""owe"" my mother a strong relationship. To this day, she gets respect for being my mother, but she will probably never get the mother daughter relationship she always wanted, and that was decided the day she invaded my privacy.

This is a plea to all parents out there that your children are people too. They want privacy too. It is a reasonable desire as a human being to want to keep some thoughts to yourself. I don't think as a parent you have the right to know every single thought that passes through your child's mind. It is absolutely toxic to keep yourself bottled up, both as an adult and a child.

If you think your child is involved in things you don't want them to be in, I could understand the reasons for your actions more. But I was a remarkably boring child growing up, even had the nickname ""goody two shoes"" in school. There was absolutely no reason to be snooping to that extent. Over thirteen years has passed since then, but this event was so important to our relationship dynamic that I remember it like it was yesterday.

Please... please don't break your child's trust and privacy like my mother did mine. I really beg you.",11Jan2017,4

4,"It's not an unusual thing to find at my job (not for nefarious reasons though, they're just used to open boxes and do other everyday things at my office) and I'm sure nobody will notice it's missing.

He had worked all his adult life including time in the military. He got to the point to where working full time was just too much for him and asked to be placed on casual work. After a health setback and two weeks off work his job fired him.

17,"I was walking down the street on my way to class today when a guy sitting on the sidewalk asked me for spare change. He was dressed somewhat decently, not a suit &amp; tie by any means but I've seen fellow students wear worse to class, a little chubby too. I'm not one to make assumptions about people's life situations but he looked more put together than the majority of homeless people around here. I told him I didn't have any spare change, sorry. He then asked if I would buy him food, which I decided hey why not. I asked him what he wanted and he said the name of a gyro place really close by. I tell him ""yeah, sure, I'll buy you a gyro."" So we go there, and as soon as we get there he grabs two sodas from the fridge. I then ask him what he wants and he tells the cashier three gyros, two orders of fries, and the two sodas. I can tell from his demeanor he's been to this place before, and a gyro at this place costs like $8 and is definitely enough food for a meal on its own. So I tell the cashier ""eh just one of each please"", to which this guy who asked me for food gives me a dirty look. I pay for the dude's meal, which is a gyro, fries, and the two sodas. I tell him I have to run to class and to enjoy his meal, to which he responds ""whatever"" and walks away.

I'm not trying to get sympathy or acknowledgement for buying some dude food, I just feel oddly perplexed by the whole thing. My first reaction was wanting to tell him to fuck off and tell the cashier to cancel the order, but I decided to just leave. I was a bit pissed off because I felt like he tried to take advantage of me, I'm a student and the amount of money he tried to get me to spend on food for him without asking would have been like $35, which is a big chunk of my budget. After thinking about it more though I don't know if I really have a right to be pissed off at the guy. He might have a mental illness or some tough life issues going on that lead to him sitting on the sidewalk asking for money. I have parents who will just transfer money to my bank account if I really need it, he clearly doesn't. Maybe he saw me as some rich kid being selfish for not buying him more food. I certainly don't see it that way, I viewed it as him being a dick, but maybe he hadn't eaten in a long time and genuinely thought he needed three gyros. Maybe I was a doormat for still buying him food after he was a dick about it, and should have told him to fuck off. I dunno man. I just was trying to be nice and left with a weird feeling. I've bought homeless people food before and they just said ""thanks"", end of story. The unexpected moral quandary has left me wondering if I would do the same thing again.",11Jan2017,31

I didn't even make it a full semester before I realized I really didn't want to be an actress. Not knowing what I wanted to do and not wanting to waste money, I dropped out of college. After a few years in the workforce, mostly as a pca, I decided at 27 I want to teach special education. You know what? This is too much to write. I am 28 and I work front desk at a fucking gym.

I've never been approached by another woman. And I'm not ugly. Everyone I've ever known tells me I'm conventionally attractive. I realize that's not how the game is played.

21,"My lease ended and my friend is away so I asked her if she can let me stay in her 2B2B... her roommate knows me too.  She is cool with it (which I really appreciate!!), so things have been great.  However, two days ago I asked her if it'd be okay my LDR girlfriend (she has met her too.) visits me and we stay at her room too.    She replied saying she won't feel comfortable, so I told her okay then my GF will stay with GF's sister, and we will plan to have a trip on the weekend.  She said okay first but later she seemed to have a nerve breakdown so practically forced me to volunteer to leave for this week (had to hand the keys back to her BF, cuz I just learned that her roommate is also gone for this week.).

While I can understand that it is probably too much to ask what I asked, but why would she react so much to my question?  Is it because she is a neat freak?  Then why would she let me stay anyways?   I mean, she said no and it's understandable,   I also mentioned to her that we can use my air mattress, and would be very respectful at her place.  I didn't mean to put her on the spot, so I told her it's understandable if she says no.   was it WRONG to ask something like this?  did I break our friendship by JUST asking?

22,"Using an old throwaway account for this, as I'm gonna say some very personal stuff about people close to me.  I just can't keep it to myself anymore, though. 

Some background - I'm 21, and I've been dating my current girlfriend for nearly six months.  She's 20 and currently living with her older sister.

They both struggle with depression, as do I.  I've been doing *much* better ever since I started dating this girl, though.

Over the past several months, my girlfriend's sister has stolen *thousands* from their parents' safe.  They finally asked about it, and she fessed up.  This was maybe a month ago.  Since then, she's been dangerously depressed.  She hasn't had a job for nearly a year (my girlfriend supports both of them), and still doesn't have one.  She hardly does chores around the house - occasionally with much pestering she'll do laundry or dishes, but that all mostly falls on my girlfriend as well.  All the sister really does is waste time in Skyrim and on the internet.

So my girlfriend is basically paying for two lives, and doing all the chores and work for two lives, all while struggling with her own emotions and depression.  That alone is enough for me to seriously dislike the sister, but then, because of her guilt and depression, she starts lashing out at my girlfriend on top of it all.  She says *seriously* abusive shit.  Things like ""you aren't my sister anymore, "" ""you don't need me now that you have him [me], "" and ""I wish you'd just give up on me already, I'm just hurting you.""  I can only see my girlfriend maybe twice per week - the rest of her time is dedicated to her sister.  Even then, she often lies to her sister about hanging out with me.  If that's not an indication of a deeply abusive relationship I don't know what is.  My girlfriend is being abused and held emotionally hostage.  If she shows too much interest in me, then her sister will feel that she's right about not being needed, and who knows what she'll do?

This isn't a one-time thing, either.  They have these horrid fights probably twice per week, and my girlfriend always texts me discretely (so her sister won't notice) asking me to just tell her it's okay.  The worst time, last Thursday, she almost walked out into the snow (it was maybe -10F here at the time) with no plan she was so close to breaking.

It hurts me so much to see somebody I care about hurt like that, especially when the cause is so evident and the solution is as simple as her moving out.  I want that to happen with all of my heart - of course I want the sister to be happy, but at the end of the day I don't give a damn.  My only priority is helping my girlfriend be happy and comfortable.  She couldn't abandon her sister like that, though - she won't.

I know that I have the easy part in all of this - I'm not the one being abused, I'm not depressed to the point of possible suicidalism, but I'm still at my wit's end.  I just want to share a life with my girlfriend, for us both to just be happy and comfortable.  And we're gonna get there - I'm not giving up on that dream - but God damn do we have to fight for it.  I'm so exhausted from it all. 

Tonight, though, I swallowed my pride.  I texted the sister directly, played dumb (she obviously has no clue that I know about all of this) saying that I thought she seemed down the last few times I saw her and asking if something was up.  I totally expected her to just give me an ""I'm fine, I've just been distracted"" kind of response, but to my surprise she really opened up to me.  She basically said that she's just trying to live her life peacefully, but always seems to step on landmines and can't seem to get along with family or friends anymore despite only ever having ""pure intentions.""  She said some really nasty stuff about herself.

Nothing will forgive the horrible things she said to my girlfriend so regularly, and it boiled my blood that she still felt like a victim in all of this.  However, I kept my head and really tried with all of my heart to give her genuine advice and help her out.  I really touched her - she's deeply grateful for it.

Now, I really don't know how to feel.  The vindictive, protective part of me still wants to see her sent to in-treatment or an asylum, or anywhere that's not gonna hurt my girlfriend anymore.  The selfish part of me still really wants to sit her down one-on-one and really rip into her, scream until my voice gives out and make her realize how much pain and frustration she's caused, to hell with the consequences.  Another part of me feels guilty for not saying how I actually feel and think, and for lying to her about knowing about it all.  And yet, in spite of all of this, part of me really feels bad for her and genuinely wants her to be happy and fulfilled and for her to repair her relationship with my girlfriend.  I feel so conflicted, and I don't know what's right anymore.

Thank you to anybody who read it all - I just really had to get it off my chest.",11Jan2017,1

24,"I had a relationship with a psychopath for a few months until she told me that she was a psychopath. Then my anxiety grew and grew until I was debilitated and couldn't even talk to my family, and I stopped eating nearly as much as I used to, and basically just sat at home unable to think for a couple weeks. I broke off communication with her after doing research and realizing our relationship was a textbook example of what a relationship with a psychopath is: *amazing* sex, over-the-top flattery and agreement followed by over-the-top outrage over the tiniest of issues, insidious apologies, lies, secrets, holes in stories, manipulation, competition with exes, continued communication with exes, the ""manufactured soulmate,"" etc. There have been no problems between us, nor attempts made by her to contact me outside of the media I have shut down between us. But I am still in love with a fake persona that she created specifically to make me like her. I have had relationships of 3-4 years that have not affected me *nearly* as much as this one of 3-4 months. I was fine being single for over a year until she came into my life. Now that she's out of my life, I feel an utter emptiness that I have never in my life felt before. And what's worse is that I am completely aware that the emptiness is a longing for a person who never really existed, but was *manufactured* specifically for me. This resulted in seemingly-genuine connections between her and me, which I am now obsessively trying to cling to. I am completely infatuated with who she was to me, and I can't shake the feeling, even though I know it was too good to be true. And while I'm glad I got out before anything major happened, I feel I may have waited too late for my mental health. To make matters worse, I have always been somewhat of a loner and I have been going through this without being able to talk to any friends in person about it, only friends I have met online. I have reached out to old friends and have gone out with them recently, but I end up focusing on the fact that *she's* not there and I want *her*. Again, I realize that this is the mechanism used by psychopaths and I realize how unhealthy it is, but I can't seem to shake it. I am trying to date on multiple dating sites, even to just find some casual company or friends, but this moves very slowly.


The worst part is I have developed a paranoia. Multiple times I have worked myself into such a dark place emotionally that every noise is *her*. She's always there, but never there. She's always coming. Maybe she's within earshot. I wake up in the middle of the night to check that she isn't in my room. I can't tell anyone about this. What if she finds out? I am scared of some sort of abstract retribution that I am fairly sure rationally that she will never bring. I know for a fact that she has already moved on to (several) other partners. Why am I so stuck on her? This has never happened before. I was always the more rational one. I was always the one who moved on more quickly. I was absolutely *never* the dependent one.


Until now.


I realize how ridiculous and irrational my anxiety is, but I can't stop it. I realize that whatever connection we shared was fake, but I can't get over it. I don't even know what writing this will really accomplish, but I feel compelled to do it.",11Jan2017,6
25,"#WARNING: Super long post ahead. In all honesty, it's probably just nonsensical rambling and worth skipping over, but I'll post it around for some people to look at when they're bored/procrastinating. It feels good to put it into a place where I know it'll be seen, if nothing else.  
  
These kinds of posts are a dime a dozen, but I'll throw mine in. Maybe it's worth the .83 cents.  
  
Context:  
  
Male, in my twenties. She's in another state now. We're still best friends, and really important to one another. I'll explain in (probably) excruciating detail below, but that's all you need to know to get started.  
  
Flashback to my freshman year of high school when I first met her. I was the really awkward scrawny computer nerd, but also from a really traditionally southern family. I was always extremely socially awkward, but wanted to try and make high school a bit different, and I have a unique name so I used it to my advantage. I wanted people to like me, so I tried to make jokes. I made some decent ones and became a bit class-clowny but I was one of the smarter kids so it kinda worked really well. People would talk to me if for no other reason than I would basically do group work for them and occasionally make a good joke.  
  
Any to the who, I'm freakishly attracted to redheads. They've always been able to melt me from the inside out, and I've'nt the slightest idea why. This girl, let's call her Brit, is a redhead. She's also one of the more 'in' people. The kind who hangs out with the athletes but is also really smart they get are in with the cool popular crowd of achieving stars in high school. I'm sure it's easy enough to grasp the dynamic.  
  
My daily schedule at this time was simple enough. Wake up, get on the bus, go to school, come home, get on the computer, mess around on games with my online friends until I crashed, occasionally I would complete a homework assignment if I remembered.  
  
Meanwhile, this girl was the opposite. A well-kept planner, time slots organized from her morning routine to what she would do after school that day. No, this isn't going to be a Nicholas Sparks ""oh from the moment I saw her"" sort of thing, although I admit she *is* strikingly beautiful and I knew that even then, but lots of people can be beautiful. I didn't interact with her my freshman year that much, as she seemed one of those people I'd never talk to.  
   
Well this girl I guess liked my humor or maybe it was just my weird name, but she made an effort several times to try and talk to me in our class together; it was Geometry, not that anyone cares. I didn't really have any friends at the time. My best friend from middle school moved to a different state, and the people who knew me the most were all online. I spent most of my freshman year trying to hold back sweat when I saw her red hair, and otherwise furthering my braveness in the face of society. I really wanted to *not* be awkward.  
  
Sophomore year was where my life truly changed, and luckily it was for the better (I mean... generally for the better.) We got placed in the same English class by a stroke of computer-generated luck. The stars decided that instead of the 4 other English classes at that level we could've been placed in, we would be placed in one together. And as the universe would have it, our last names happened to be very close alphabetically and our teacher was one of those who just assigned seats in order of last name.  
  
So I got to sit right in front of her.  
  
The year prior in Geometry, I was about as far from her as I could possibly get. This year, I was right beside her in my very first class of the day. We hit it off quite well, talking about how we remembered each other from Geometry and other random high schooler talk about teachers and what we thought our teacher would be like and such. We got on the topic of schedules, and what do you know: we have another class together right after this one! I was pretty excited. I'd made a friend to spend the dreaded 'break' time with!   
  
**Aside**  
My high school had a 'break' after the first class which was about 20 minutes long and was the equivalent of social torture for those of us who had no friends.  
**/Aside**   
  
Anyway, we luckily had this in common: we both hated break/class change and both just ran straight for our next class and then read or did nothing for the rest of the time. So we could run to the next class immediately together.  
  
Time goes on, and we become friends. As a final act of defiance against my prior awkward self I decide I want to ask this cute and interesting girl out. The issue being: I wasn't old enough to drive, had no job, and was one of 2 kids in CURRENT YEAR who didn't have a cell phone. I wasn't quite 16, but I VIVIDLY remember her asking me one day before we parted for her to ride home if I had a cell phone or anything so we could talk outside of school. I just stuttered and stammered because I had no idea how to respond to this, my awkwardness shining through. Eventually I managed to say I didn't have a phone, and she told me she'd just add me on Facebook. Well, I didn't have a facebook. I told her I'd make one and just add her! Perfect! Except my (traditionally southern, remember?) parents forbid me to have one until I was at least 16.  
  
So I went behind their backs and made one anyway! Promptly was grounded, but so worth it. Thus began a series of shitty events that made me relapse into full socially awkward mode. A few days into talking to her, I see the only Facebook post that, to date, has ever caused my heart to drop: she went from being single, to being in a relationship. Don't get me wrong, the guy was a really good guy: smart and caring, mature considering the age and athletic with a decent body that puberty blessed early. He treated her really well. He was also in our English class.   
  
I am a loving guy, and want nothing more than to see smiles left on the faces of everyone I come across, but I don't think I've ever felt the... *envy* or *jealousy* toward someone that made me just illogically angry as I did when I saw him, but only in the sort of petty high school kind of way, I actually genuinely liked the guy. So I decided oh well, I'd get over it. It was a crush, there'd be more in the future, I'll continue talking to her because she was the first friend I'd had in high school as was again appealing to me.  
  
This went on for several months, and I was finding my love for computers proper. I stumbled into some luck: my school was throwing out old PCs/PC stuff. I begged my computer engineering teacher to let me go through the truck before they hauled it off and he let me. I scored so much that day that would eventually help me learn about computers: included some awesome retro stuff like vintage iMacs! The truly important part of that though, was I had a friend who offered to trade me an iPod touch, 2nd generation, in exchange for a computer that could play minecraft on any settings.  
  
I played the best damn game of scrapyard wars you ever seen to put together the scraps from that truck into a monster that could run minecraft in 720P at 30 FPS on the lowest settings. He accepted the trade and I had myself my first piece of property that was truly mine. And it let me talk to Brit without having to be at my family computer, aka all the time when I was home.  
  
This is when Brit and I made a blurry transition into being best friends, I feel. She began telling me more of her life, the things she liked, her dreams for the future. I did the same. She began to tell me about her boyfriend. I remember specifically once in her car as we drove past the baseball field (she was taking me to a nearby school my sister was studying at so my sister could take me home) where her boyfriend was at for practice and told me a story of how he bragged to her about pissing on the fence and she was upset because he had no class and was proud to be a manbaby. It was then I had my feelings for her come back, as I wanted more than anything to give her the happiness she wanted.  
  
I didn't even know what that meant then, but I do now. Toward the end of that year, I was busy being the mascot for our school (I'd basically completely overridden my social anxiety and was comfortable being who I was, thanks to her, and being mascot I could make kids and adults alike smile a little so I enjoyed it) and she was at a football game. High-school drama ensued. I had told one of my computer-class friends I liked her, and then the drama happened. She caught wind of it from someone and we talked a bit about it. The line I can remember verbatim, ""I really just want us to be best friends.""  
  
I was so glad she wasn't mad at me, above all, but damn did it hurt my innocent little soul then to hear those words.  
  
She was my best friend then, but I still had no clue how close we'd become.  
  
The next year we'd been going par for the course, and we still had a class together for our Junior year. This is where we became truly close, and where I believe our friendship was sealed, fated to become one of those rare lifelong things that persist past high school. We shot the shit in that Civics class so much. At one point, I pulled our teachers stool right up to her desk across the room, and made that my permanent seat. I somehow got that to slide, and spent the rest of that class going right to her desk every day and sitting on that stool, just so when we did busy work or anything that let me talk, we could talk. The teacher didn't mind because we didn't disrupt and we were smart enough to always get our work done on time and done well.  
  
She got me into student council and theater, I got her to [occasionally] withstand computers with me. She listened to my rants about online games, I listened to her rants about broadway stars. I would listen to her Barbra Streisand music on repeat, she'd listen to my EDM and Gregory Alan Isakov.  
  
One day I woke up and realized that this girl was truly what someone means when they say 'best friend.' I could hand her my still-beating heart and know with 100% certainty she'd see to it that it was kept as safe as her own heart.  
  
I confided in her. The stories of deep personal intra-family shit that I don't need to post here as I have had her to help me through it. She understood. She hugged me, and told me I'd never be able to get rid of her now, that I was stuck with her.  
  
She confided in me.  
  
I didn't realize this at the time, but I was sowing the seeds of my own demise. (Not really a demise... but I mean damn that sounded cool, huh?)  
  
I was, actually, sowing the seeds of what would grow into my love for her.  
  
It was around that time I believe we first actually mentioned we loved the other person. It was a weird line to cross and it was vaguely skirted around before being mentioned, probably to ensure the other party was comfortable with it. I embraced it fully. At the time, I had fought off another bout of romantic feelings for her since I wanted to be committed to being her friend 100%. The sentiment was purely based in fact of how I felt about her as a person. I loved her. I loved her as one would love their favorite song, or their favorite book. She meant something special to me, and I to her. The occasional ""I love you and what you've helped me through and how you've helped me grow"" was thrown about. I had found a true friend.  
  
A strikingly beautiful, true friend.  
  
She had broken up with her boyfriend many months before. It was a highschool relationship, not much to be said. But some few months after I had confided in her, she told me she dated him because she never felt pretty, and he treated her like she was and she liked that, and enjoyed his company and thought that was enough. She wanted to feel beautiful, and that's how she always wanted to feel. I finally realized something I should've noticed long before then: she never eats. She'd always steal a fry from me at lunch, or a chip in the afternoon. But it just then dawned on me that she never ate. She thought she was fat, and as such ugly. To this day, she struggles with her body image. That day, early in my senior year of high school, I vowed to show to her just how beautiful she is at every opportunity possible.  
  
Her snapchats are complimented for whatever is in them that she has going on. It's never superficial, I truly focus on things about her in whatever I see of her in person or from a text/snap. To my dying breath I will make sure this girl knows that she is beautiful, and that there are *definitely* people in this world that think she is beautiful, so long as I am in it.  
  
(A whole side rant: I feel as if it means less now. Like, me saying ""you're such a beautiful person"" doesn't carry the weight that it would if I were a complete stranger. In fact, that's verbatim what she's said to me. That it almost feels like an obligation of mine as her best friend to tell her that. To her, it's like I were her mother saying she's pretty. And that hurts because I want nothing more than for her to realize that's she is beautiful, anyway side rant over.)  
  
As we neared graduation we came up on something a bit... odd. Prom. I wanted to take her. I planned to, and was unfortunately cut short by one of her gay friends who wanted to also take her. I ended up going with a great girl from theater and asked her to prom with some clever word-play on my lines in our current production, with help from all the cast, but Brit was upset because of how she was asked. She is big into the grandeur, I suppose is the best way. The displays of effort, at the very least. She deserved more than what she got: a cutout star that just said prom, about the size of normal sheet of paper. I had already planned a Glee-themed skit with which to ask her that I knew she'd love, even coming from a friend. When she told me she would be going with him and that he was going to 'ask' (you know, for pictures and instagram and whatnot) in a few days, I told her that sucked because I wanted to ask her. Later she asked for how I planned to, and I told her. I probably shouldn't have, because I guess I made what happened seem all that worse, but I vividly remember the conversation we had after he asked her. She asked me to come with her for it, she had no idea what to expect, and I stood in the corner (to respect that the moment was for him and her and all her friends) and was the only one who could see through her feigned happiness. She was upset. Very much so. Anyway the conversation we had later culminated in a quote I hold very dear to me: ""I know some people are out there *looks directly at me* who would truly put the effort in.""  
  
Prom was... nothing special: no I didn't do that teenager thing of banging my prom date in a roach motel, I had no inclination and neither did she. We went as friends. I didn't get to dance with Brit there, though I had many a fantasy about it happening. At least, not ""dancing."" We bounced around and talked.  
  
#Editor's Note: This is getting long... jeez I have a lot on my chest  
  
It was the move toward graduation where I first thought truly about my feelings for her. It was sparked by a dream. I'd been fascinated with DayZ, like most of the internet world around that time, and as such had a dream about the two things on my mind when I crashed for the night: zombies and Brit.  
  
Brit died, in my dream. I swear to this day I've never felt a pain quite so horrifying as the pain I felt in a dream. But it was the first time I ever let myself say anything more than 'I am infatuated with her.' Another sort of divergence: I had girlfriends during this time, too. As I said, I went through periods where I felt no romantic inclinations toward Brit at all, despite how beautiful she is. But my dad taught me to always question myself, to never let infatuation be confused for love. So I refused to say I was in love with her. I knew it was just me being extremely infatuated with her, or the idea of her.  
  
So I let myself rest on that.  
  
Then graduation comes around. She's going off to college in another state, I'm staying in state but moving quite far. We know this isn't the end of our saga, and absolutely nothing would change except how often we were face to face. I'm lucky in that nothing did change, except our frequency of face-to-face visits, but something else did change. That final summer, the last summer of our lives as kids, cemented something in me. How often I saw her. When I showed up to her work (a local pool as a lifeguard, which was lax and I was able to just talk to her) or when we just went to the mall or, our favorite, to meet at the tennis courts before going out for a ride to get coffee and just listen to music and talk about random shit. It was during that time I finally accepted that I was falling for my best friend. And I wasn't just falling for her as a way to express I wanted to go out with her. I was falling in love with her. The more I learned of her flaws, the less perfect she became as a person to me, the more I fell. Her obsession with celebrities and broadway, how she analyzes obscure interviews and videos from her favorite stars during their primes in days long forgotten, how she chooses music that reflects her current thoughts and not just her moods, her (admittedly, rather large) forehead, how she over-stresses on sometimes trivial matters, how she'll punish herself for a grade as good as 97 because she should do better, how she kills herself daily at the gym for hours because she woke up weighing half a pound more. These things make her so very human to me, and her struggles have slowly become my own. I began to fight for and with her against the daily grind, against her life stresses.  
  
I've spent the past years of my life, unwittingly at first, falling for a very imperfect girl that just so happens to make her the most perfect girl in the world, at least to me. It took me so long to realize she helps me achieve new heights.  
  
When I thanked her recently for listening to my rant on Esports, despite her not really knowing what I was talking about, she simply said ""It's important to you. Therefore, it's important to me."" and it's the things like that that make me look her and just appreciate that this human being who has no more obligation to me than I do to a lumberjack in Utah can find such common ground over such a long time and at the end of it all, despite all the shit I pull, stand up and say trivial irrelevant things matter simply because I give them merit just lends credit to what I think my body's known for years: I'm in love with my best friend.  
  
Well, that seemed like a conclusion huh, well nah. Recently, it's become hard to bear. I suppose that's why I'm on /r/offmychest. Ocassionally, not daily but multiple times a month, she'll be upset in a way loosely tied to her image. Boys at the college she's at, according to her, don't notice or care about her. Boys don't notice her or give her the time of day, in her words. Most recently, it was ""There was a cute boy at my work training, but I couldn't get him to give me the time of day."" when I asked how her work training went at the start of this year.  
  
There's been that part of me that wants so very much for her to see me as she saw that cute boy. She has no obligation to me at all, she certainly doesn't have to be attracted to me in the way I am to her or in any way. But really, if I felt 100% super duper about it all, I wouldn't be here. And let's be real, after this wall of text I doubt anyone is here but me anyway but fuck it.  
  
I want to move where she's at, I want to take her out for one of those legitimate dates she's wanted to go on for a while now, and I want to cuddle with her and show her the affection she hasn't had. I want days of peanut butter on the couch watching old videos of broadway actresses making inside jokes that somehow she gets, trips to just get a coffee and drive around listening to her collections of music, watching the confusion on her face as she attempts to learn what a computer do, see her finally pull off a game with some aptitude, hear her delight when we end up seeing a show she loves, and I want her to know that with every fiber of my being I love and appreciate who she is, every last aspect of her.  
  
Every time she retweets something about wanting to be taken out on a date, or every time she texts me worried she'll die alone I just want to open my brain, and let her feel the raw emotions I feel when she speaks. How my heart jumps to my throat when she creases her brow and slightly cranes her neck forward. Like I said, she like the grandeur. I'd never throw a text like what I've done here, or even do anything similar over the phone. She deserves so much more than that. She deserves a wonderful, romantic story.  
  
We are as close as I've ever been with another human being, and as close as I think one can get to another without becoming someone else entirely. She's who I tell everything to, but this is kinda about her, isn't it? So I guess I come to /r/offmychest to try and sort through the shit your brain does when it's woefully overwhelmed by these powerful and complex emotions.  
  
I've told myself I'd bring it up casually. Just a like. ""Hey, we are home for X holiday, why don't we go out together. Like, a real formal thing where you get dressed up, and I show up a few minutes early and act all nervous as I hold the door, and pull your chairs out for you 'n shit and if we could go somewhere your dog could come to that'd be pretty cool"" where I could then casually mention how much I enjoy it and her and the entire idea...  
  
Except the next time she's in town is this weekend, but it's for a funeral for her Grandfather and she already hit me up to do one of our coffee runs because we haven't seen each other in person in six months.  
  
It's not a crazy idea, right? We're best friends. Crazier shit happens in this world. The craziest thing I've ever been is crazy for her.
   
  
I'm sorry for this wall of text. Thank you for your listening eyes, even if it was only for the first few sentences before you realized I'd written a legal document-sized tome.

34,"For the past two years I have been a functioning alcoholic, and the effects of drinking have started to take their toll on my family and work. That's why I committed to make 2017 alcohol-free.

So far so good--no drinking--and so far it has been fairly easy. I have an all-or-nothing personality, and, once I'm committed to something, be it drinking or sobriety, as long as it's not moderation, I can usually stick to it.

The thing is, every night this year I had a dream that I drank. Craft beer was my drink of choice, but in these dreams I'm always drinking beer that I always disliked: Miller Light one night, Shiner Bock another, Red Oak amber followed by Newcastle brown, etc. Every single dream ends with overwhelming feelings of guilt and disappointment at breaking my commitment.

So, not only do I not get to enjoy a beer IRL, I am also not getting to enjoy it in my dreams. Why can't I have a nice pint of Dale's Pale Ale with my mates and not feel guilty about it at least while I am dreaming?

36,"I am 27 years old, living in the city still a bachelor. I hooked up with a girl from a bar (I kind of knew her from high school) and I knocked her up. Here is the kicker...she's pregnant with TRIPLETS. I like her, and I'm going to do right by the kids and try to make it work with her, but this all just got thrown on me out of nowhere and I have no idea what I'm doing at all. I have no experience with kids and I have 3 and they are coming in 7 weeks! Her first OBGYN must have been blind because we didn't find out they were triplets until she started having complications and had to go to the ER. The doctor said she can't bare them all through a complete Pregnancy so they scheduled a c-section for 7 weeks from now. Basically not only did I get this Triplett bomb dropped on me, I also have to be ready earlier than anticipated. I'm not at all prepared and I have to be ready for 3 babies in less than 2 months. I'll make it (I think) but like I said my life just got straight flipped on its head. I've spent my 20's working hard and concentrating on my career, living in the city, and being single enjoying myself. Every aspect of what I am used to is no longer. I have to break down all of my habits and completely revitalize absolutely everything and manage to save enough money to be ready in this short amount of time. I'm straight freaking out. 


Edit: I'm not ""freaking out"" per say I have a cool head, I'm just realizing so much so quickly it's kind of blowing me away. I have so many habits to correct. My cares and worries are being entirely realigned. When I thought it was 1 baby I wasn't worried at all. I knew exactly what I was gonna do, but since I found out it's 3 kids my old life seems like an obsolete dream. It's like I'm in limbo, my old life behind me, my new life ahead of me, and I'm just trying to catch my breathe and figure out what the hell just happened.

40,"Yesterday I had one of these moments , Where something happens  and your heart just jumps out of your chest , every hair stands on end and you lock up tighter then every before. 

Ever since I got my drivers license , [5 years ago already ...wow ] One of my biggest fears has been hitting a kid. I'm not going to say I'm a perfect angel when driving because of it , I have a sports car I use it as such on the back roads any chance i get . 

I have to drive through a few new developments on my way to town from the middle of bum-fuck nowhere country side. I watch kids running around the schools and parks all the time to try and avoid this . But yesterday it almost happened and just like everyone says it was in the blink of an eye . 

Was crusing at about 20 mph past one of the parks just letting the car roll on it's own looking over at the park cause there were a ton of people , i watched the park , then looked at all cars parked along side the road next to me checking for people or open doors .  For just a moment just outside of my line of sight i thought i saw something red pass over my car ,  and as i turned to look from ym right where the park was to my left where the red object was , a kid ran out between the cars to go after a frizbee the kids father had thrown to high. 

My heart skipped i slammed on the breaks pulled the e-brake and sat there with arms and legs grid locked . Stopped 5 feet from the kid . The Father came over to apologize but i couldn't even look at him. Was still so frozen and upset i couldn't move i had just barely managed to let go of the steering wheel by the time he had run over got his kid and come to talk to me . 

To put some reference to this , I'm 25 , white , male . who dose not want kids . But this has always been one of my worst fears. I know I couldn't live with myself had I of killed someones child. The only reason I don't head out to the highway to avoid such places is because that route actually would add a extra 10 min of travel and my car robs me enough of money as is being it only take premium fuel. 

I do often wonder , what gets under other peoples skin in this way , everyone has a fear or something they would never want to happen that has almost happened in their life time .

42,"In a little under five months, I will have lived almost half my life without my father. It’s a realization that has an effect that a lot of people in this area of the world do not and will not ever understand. There was about one week of 5th grade left when my dad went into the hospital for an aortic dissection. He was lucky to get into surgery in time. After surviving for a few weeks his lungs shut down because there wasn’t enough blood flow. Just like that, he was gone. I went to the waiting room almost immediately and while I was in tears I worked on a puzzle, I don’t remember what it was of. It’s also an overstatement to say I was working on it; I was more just moving pieces around to move them, not to find out where they go. While I was sitting there a woman asked if I was ok, and all I could say was, “My dad just died.” She couldn’t say anything back.


After he passed, I tried to reach out to my friends at the time, but a conversation about death and drug addiction is out of the norm for a group of ten-year-olds to have. I ended up feeling alienated. It’s not something that’s uncommon, people can get weird around death, scared almost. It was almost as though people felt it was contagious. Not just my friends, but I think their families as well. Like my dead dad syndrome might spread around the school. That’s not to say that people weren’t supportive of my family and I. People were supportive and helped, of course. However, a ten-year-old without a father needs something different than a few casseroles and honestly, I’m still trying to figure out what that is.


Now, a decade has passed and I’m still dealing with it. The issues are different from those of when I was ten. People compare me to him a lot. Not just the physical features, but my personality as well. The way I smile, the way I talk, even the sort of jokes that I make. It’s still dealing with a loss, but it’s a loss that’s near unknowable. I don’t remember what my dad sounded like or even what he looked like. I don’t know what his values were, what he was passionate about, or even what type of music he liked. I’m the Vice President of the Black Student Union at my school, and I don’t know how he would feel about it. Those are the hardest parts. Those are the parts that people can’t understand.


At the core, I don’t know who my father was and as a result, it feels like I don’t know who I am, or at least who I think I’m supposed to be. There are more people that understand now that I’m older. More people that forget what their loved one’s voices sound like. It helps to know you’re not alone. That’s not to say I don’t feel alone because I do; It’s something I think about every day. Not just his death, but also the drug addiction and his lifestyle in general and what that means for me. It still scares people. It still scares me. But the hardest part is that I know that when I say, “My dad died,” people still can’t say anything back. ",11Jan2017,60

You were on your way home when you died.

 
It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.

 
And that’s when you met me.

 
“What… what happened?” You asked. “Where am I?”

 
“You died,” I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.

 
“There was a… a truck and it was skidding…”

 
“Yup,” I said.

 
“I… I died?”

 
“Yup. But don’t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,” I said.

 
You looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. “What is this place?” You asked. “Is this the afterlife?”

 
“More or less,” I said.

 
“Are you god?” You asked.

 
“Yup,” I replied. “I’m God.”

 
“My kids… my wife,” you said.

 
“What about them?”

 
“Will they be all right?”

 
“That’s what I like to see,” I said. “You just died and your main concern is for your family. That’s good stuff right there.”

 
You looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn’t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty. “Don’t worry,” I said. “They’ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn’t have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it’s any consolation, she’ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.”
“Oh,” you said. “So what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?”

 
“Neither,” I said. “You’ll be reincarnated.”

 
“Ah,” you said. “So the Hindus were right,”

 
“All religions are right in their own way,” I said. “Walk with me.”

 
You followed along as we strode through the void. “Where are we going?”

 
“Nowhere in particular,” I said. “It’s just nice to walk while we talk.”

 
“So what’s the point, then?” You asked. “When I get reborn, I’ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won’t matter.”

 
“Not so!” I said. “You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don’t remember them right now.”

 
I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. “Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It’s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it’s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you’ve gained all the experiences it had.
 

“You’ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven’t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you’d start remembering everything. But there’s no point to doing that between each life.”
 

“How many times have I been reincarnated, then?”
 

“Oh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.” I said. “This time around, you’ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.”
 

“Wait, what?” You stammered. “You’re sending me back in time?”
 

“Well, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.”
 

“Where you come from?” You said.
 

“Oh sure,” I explained “I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you’ll want to know what it’s like there, but honestly you wouldn’t understand.”
 

“Oh,” you said, a little let down. “But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.”
 

“Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don’t even know it’s happening.”
 

“So what’s the point of it all?”
 

“Seriously?” I asked. “Seriously? You’re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn’t that a little stereotypical?”
 

“Well it’s a reasonable question,” you persisted.
 

I looked you in the eye. “The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.”  


“You mean mankind? You want us to mature?”

 
“No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.”

 
“Just me? What about everyone else?”
 

“There is no one else,” I said. “In this universe, there’s just you and me.”
 

You stared blankly at me. “But all the people on earth…”
 

“All you. Different incarnations of you.”
 

“Wait. I’m everyone!?”
 

“Now you’re getting it,” I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back.
 

“I’m every human being who ever lived?”
 

“Or who will ever live, yes.”
 

“I’m Abraham Lincoln?”
 

“And you’re John Wilkes Booth, too,” I added.
 

“I’m Hitler?” You said, appalled.
 

“And you’re the millions he killed.”
 

“I’m Jesus?”
 

“And you’re everyone who followed him.”
 

You fell silent.
 

“Every time you victimized someone,” I said, “you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you’ve done, you’ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.”
 

You thought for a long time.
 

“Why?” You asked me. “Why do all this?”
 

“Because someday, you will become like me. Because that’s what you are. You’re one of my kind. You’re my child.”
 

“Whoa,” you said, incredulous. “You mean I’m a god?”

 
“No. Not yet. You’re a fetus. You’re still growing. Once you’ve lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.”
 

“So the whole universe,” you said, “it’s just…”
 

“An egg.” I answered. “Now it’s time for you to move on to your next life.”
 

And I sent you on your way.

47,"""'God bless America!' Once again, respectfully, I say to myself: 'What the fuck does that mean?' God bless America? 
Is that a request? Is that a demand? Is that a suggestion?

 Politicians say it at the end of every speech as if it were some sort of verbal tick that they can’t get rid of. 'God bless you and God bless America! God bless you and God bless America!' I guess they figure that if they leave it out someone’s gonna think they’re bad Americans! Let me tell you a little secret about God, folks: God does not give a flyin’ fuck about America. OK? He doesn’t care! He never cared about this country! He never has, he never will. He doesn’t care about this country anymore than he cares about Mongolia, Transylvania, Pittsburgh, the Suez Canal or the North Pole! He simply doesn’t care, OK? He doesn’t care!

 Listen! There are 200 countries in the world now! Do these people honestly think that God is sitting around picking out his favorites? Why would he do that? Why would God have a favorite country? And why would it be America out of all the countries?

 Because you have the most money? Because he likes our National Anthem? Maybe it’s because he heard we have 18 delicious flavors of Classic Rice-A-Roni? It’s delusional thinking! 

And America is not alone with this sort of delusions. Military cemeteries around the world are packed with brainwashed dead soldiers who were convinced God was on their side. America prays for God to destroy our enemies. Our enemies pray for God to destroy us. Somebody’s gonna be disappointed! Somebody’s wasting their fucking time! Could it be… everyone? 

Now… now… If people wanna say 'God Bless America,' that’s their business, I don’t care, but here’s what I don’t understand: If they say 'God Bless America,' presumably, they believe in God and if they do, they must have heard, God loved everyone! That’s what he said, he loved everyone and loved them equally! So why would these people ask God to do something that went against his own teachings?

 You know what these 'God Bless America' people oughta do? They oughta check with that Jesus fellow they’re so crazy about. They’re always talking about 'What would Jesus do?' They don’t wanna know so they can do it – they just wanna know so they can tell other people to do it! Well, I’ll tell you what Jesus would have done.

 I’ll tell you what Jesus would have done! He would have gone up on the top of the Empire State Building and said: 'God bless everyone around the world forever and ever ’till the end of time!' That’s what Jesus would have done, and that’s what these people should do, or else they should admit that 'God Bless America' is really just some sort of an empty slogan, with no real meaning except for something vague like 'good luck!' Good luck, America! You’re on your own!… which is a little bit closer to the truth!""",11Jan2017,2

50,"I recently received several thousand dollars from inheritance, and now I finally have enough money to buy a car. I already have a car, and have had cars before this one, but this is much different. This is the first time I have the means of purchasing a car. It's my decision on what to get, since it is my money. I wont be getting a car that is older than me. It won't be a crappy hand-me-down pity car that breaks down often. Don't get me wrong, I am very thankful for having vehicles given to me, but this is going to be a special moment for me. I get to choose one that fits me, my style, and my lifestyle. I'll get emotionally attached to it. 

And the first thing I'm going to do is drift in my school's empty parking lot late at night. ",11Jan2017,1
