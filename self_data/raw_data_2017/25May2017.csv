0,"I set the bar really high for myself in most areas of my life. It makes my successes much more rewarding if I actually get them, and it keeps me used to failure so I don't get distraught when I can't do something. However, it gives me a pretty negative view on myself. I don't hate or remotely dislike myself - I'm very happy with who I am - I just know I can do better, like that girl in my math class or that guy on TV. I'm graduating next week and the mood is changing at school. Everyone is savoring the moments with the friends they've made, including me. Just...I haven't realized how much I've affected other people. I've thought a lot about how I ended up with the friends I have, and a lot of them started as seemingly insignificant relationships. Some people have valued my friendship more than I've valued theirs, and some of my actions I didn't pay much attention to really stuck with them after all this time. It's overwhelming. I don't feel like I deserve this. I don't see myself the way they see me. I think I'm too fake to too many people.

Such is life I guess. My career still continues, and that's the easiest thing to focus on right now.",25May2017,1
1,"For the last nearly 4 years I was severely depressed this led to me dropping out of HS due to circumstances. Over those 4 years I had no will or motivation to do anything with my life no one was pushing me and I sure as hell wasn’t pushing myself.

Towards the end of 2016 I kicked my life into gear I started college and I got a job and along the way I met a wonderful girl our relationship was long distance but we talked of plans to meet soon and it all felt real. Throughout the time span of everything life was going better but slowly getting worse as all my friends became busy and distanced themselves from me. 

Now aside from the few friends I talk to one daily around midnight and some a few times a week. She was all I had everyday keeping me motivated cheering me on just being a positive influence in my life. This was something I never had prior and today she left me in a very cold manor.

Pretty much saying the past 10 months we have been together shouldn’t have ever happened and pretty much also belittling me over various things. Now I sit here under the realization that I have no one in my life. 

I was doing so well and now I’m about to start my summer classes and I don’t know if I can handle all the pressure that’s going to follow it I feel like my life is slowly regressing back to the state it was everything good that happens to me just finds a way to leave I don’t deserve happiness I guess. 

Sorry for the long story.

TLDR - For the first time in my life I was happy and now it's all slowly being taken away.

3,"First of all: It's 2:10AM now and I'm writing this a 3rd time. 
It might be a bit muddled, but please bear with it.
My reason for writing this is that my insomnia, which is caused by my hyperactive brain, leaves me no rest. So, I am writing this down and sharing it with the people, who might be interested, hoping that it might relieve me and let me find some sleep &amp; maybe get some new perspectives.

Disclaimer: This is my thought process, meaning it is biased &amp; subjective. It does neither state facts nor truths. Furthermore it is not about judging ""good &amp; evil"", ""right &amp; wrong"".

""From my point of view, human needs are like magical, ever-changing locks. Never resting. Never truly satisfied.
Our life consists out of the struggle to find a fitting key for every minute, every second, not realising (or even though we realise) that the key we found might not fit anymore. 

The reaction to this can be characterized into 3 Archetypes (although this term is lacking).

- The Brute: In the Brute manifests the tension, which gets initiated through the despairing lack of a ""right"" key, into aggression. This might lead to ""ramming"" a random (or similar to a subjectively seen ""right"") key into our lock. Maybe damaging both, or their relative perception, in the process (aka ""The short-termed end justifies the means""). 

- The Nihilist: Refusing the self-fulfilling, temporary, emotional or pointless aspect of the whole search (aka ""Only the goal matters"") might lead to dejection or despair over the uncontrollable nature of our needs. That is, what this Archetype embodies.

- The Hedonist: Accepting the nature of our needs might lead to living for their &amp; our own self-fulfillment. Enjoying the every little bit you can get. (aka ""Gasping for air"").

Now, I called the word ""Archetypes"" lacking. I justify this because of a simple aspect:
Humans &amp; our needs are no static creatures. We are ever-changing, ever-evolving. A simple accident might change our very ""core"". And that's why archetypes is flawed, it is more of a flow between those. Making them some kind of frames &amp; extremes and sometimes even the same. 

Which leads me to an example:
Relationships (talking of the amorous kind).

Everyone that ever had a crush knows how it feels. Tingly, new, exciting.
But a crush can only last 2 years, if it lasts that long (Source: Google). 
So, how do relationships transcend this, because our needs will notice soon enough that something might be missing?

Now you can - of course - dump that old Boyfriend or Girlfriend, get a new one, maybe make a cycle out of it. I think that is actually what most people do, because it's more simple.

On the other hand, when this day comes (and it will come) you might be prepared. 
Because there is one thing our needs have in common. Most of the time we want ""more"".
Meaning: More crushes? Maybe 2? Not exactly.
I'm talking about a new level of affection: Love.

So, how does one get there?

Evolving yourself and your relationship.

Important factors for a ""healthy"" realtionship are:

- Time with your SO is important, but time for yourself is even more important (Being clingy stops change, and it makes you dependent. Dependent is the opposite of equals).

- Trust. While having a Crush emphasises the physical aspect of a relationship, it is actually quite ""shallow"", whereas Love is often described to be ""deep"". This is where Trust comes into the game. Your SO is more than a boy- / girlfriend. He or She is your partner. Your best friend. Someone to lean on &amp; someone to support.

- Last, but not least: Give &amp; Take. Sounds quite abstract. But it's the bread &amp; butter of every relationship. What most people make wrong is that they tend to slip into extreme behaviour: They either want everything. Full stop. Or: They sacrifice themselves for the greater good. 
Both is not healthy for a relationship. Now, while my first point should be accepted by most of the readers, the second one is the tricky one. 
The reason lies that we are taught: Selflessness = Good.
But actually the equation is more like:
Selflessness = Supressed Desires = Frustration.
And a lot of bottled-up Frustration can kill almost anything pretty quickly.

That's it. Now it's 3:17 and I hope that I will be able to sleep now.

TL;DR: Needs are needy. Don't ignore them (supress them), don't let them dictate your life. Always keep a healthy balance.",25May2017,3

It was clearly a first date. They met at this bar with the goal of picking a restaurant nearby, but oh man she was super not into it. 

Some guys, I swear, have no idea how self-centered and domineering they come off. He cut her off before she could answer his questions. He made their plans for the evening after berating her ignorance of jerk chicken and dark and stormies.

7,"I can't relax. I am a mid 20's guy working in engineering. Live in Miami. Feel intellectually isolated with my group of friends and family. family is super religious. I'm not religious at all. my dad is difficult to talk to. no real family in Miami even though i am a hispanic guy (who can't speak spanish). felt somewhat neglected growing up. never was really allowed to be social probably because of my parents fear of the world stemming from their religious beliefs and my own anxieties. grew up with a computer. my dad worked as an electrical engineer. only way we really connected was through it. i think i sort of have an attachment to computers from it.

Just broke up with a 2 yr relationship with a girl i met when i moved here (she ended it). i felt like i could be my self around her and her family. Wow i loved her family. So accepting and really intelligent and amazing people. feel a bit foolish about it all though. I guess i was having fun. the job and social setting was fun. she was always distant though. never any emotions. seems to have been trying to figure out who she was. she was a few years older than me and that difference can be a deal breaker when your not financially settled in a new area. sort of bothers me that i hung on so long but i was trying to be content and find some kind of rhythm. I have always felt like i could never find a rhythm. Im an anxious guy. I can't relax. the anxiety runs my life.

Work was at first really fun but now it has turned hostile. No room to grow, low pay, and high anxiety. Decided to turn the breakup into an opportunity. Asked for a transfer to an office out in san Francisco and got it. I have my brother out in California and I have always wanted to explore the west coast. the scenery seems so amazing. i hear the weather is great and that its the mecca of all things tech. I should be moving out there in a month. its exciting and keeping me busy. budgeting will be a challenge but i'm prepared to downgrade my lifestyle. I would do anything for change.

I have always found programming fascinating. I have been using some languages for some time now either while i was in grad school or at work. As an engineer, i do have somewhat of a love affair with the idea of creating a solutions and seeing it come to physical existence, but there are so many things that water that process and feeling down. with coding, that all goes away, and i can really leverage what it is that i am designing and the impact is so limitless. I am wanting a career change. hopefully that will be a bit more within reach. Miami is just not a tech city.

When i first came to Miami, i was hoping to get in touch with the inner hispanic but i just didn't grow up with that culture. I feel more out of place here than in previous places i have lived.

I wish she would come with me to San Francisco. Just get away from it all which i know she has always wanted to do. I wish she had the courage to take that kind of a risk. I wish she actually loved me back. I wish she actually wanted to be with me. I wish she was ready, and cared about my feelings. I wish she knew I don't blame her for ending it because we never talked about the future of the relationship. I wish had the money and the established social circle to provide for her.

She was the only thing that kept me from delaying thinking about my future goals. The realist in me is ready for disappointment when I go out west, but I know i have to do this for myself. It's to the point where i have internalized it as a part of my identity. 

I hope I can find happiness and a culture that is more in line with who i am. I hope i find others just as lost as me who feel just as out of place in their places of origin as i do. I hope I find what I am looking for.",25May2017,1
11,"First post here, I don't know...just needing to get this out of me.

I used to be a successful white collar executive.  Self made, grew up poor, etc.  I used to live to work, not work to live.

I found my wife, and she was incredibly perfect and amazing to me.  8 months after we married she was diagnosed with cancer.  For 4 years we bounced from cancer center to cancer center as I watched her slowly shrivel up and die.  She had head/neck cancer....so soon on in the process she lost her ability to speak, eat...eventually had her tongue cut out.  I think I did a good job of taking care of her, my job as an executive gave me liberties to work on the go, etc.

I made a judgement call one month to take a week long trip to an office I was responsible for, it was long overdue.  She seemed stable, family was present...I justified it.  I made the 8 hour drive, checked into the hotel...and I began my week at work.

The next night, I had a late meeting, and missed the calls/messages from my wife.  She often tried to talk on the phone without a tongue....it wasn't always easy to understand...but I was always proud of her for trying.  Anyways, I missed those calls...got to the hotel late...and decided to let her rest, while I sat in the hotel room and got drunk.  So much pain and trauma over the last few years....sometimes drinking was my only way to sleep.

The next morning at my office I got a call from a crying and horrified mother in law....my wife was dead...  Paramedics were trying to revive....but she was already cold.  I immediately got in the car and began the 8 hour drive back home.  It was a sickening surreal experience.

I got home, actually went straight to the funeral home...and my wife was in a room untouched, they wanted to wait for me.  I held her and cried and cried.  The family started pulling me away.  Apparently she had been gone so long the body did what dead bodies do - started decomposing, and she began gurgling up blood all over me... But I hadn't noticed.

At 29 years old my wife was dead.  At the age of 30 I became a widower.  To this day I am haunted by the fact I wasn't there for her when she died.  I regret every moment I chose work over her.  Every night that I let her sleep alone as I sat in my home office, on the computer, drinking to calm my nerves.  So many times in so many ways, albeit mostly very small ways, I made her second place in my life.  I mean I kicked ass as a caregiver...but just the small moments I chose to do something other than be with her I will always regret.

After she died I became an alcoholic.  I lost my executive job...for two years I fell into an abyss.  It came to a head after I got in trouble twice within 3 months for driving over the legal limit.  No one was hurt, no property was damaged...but I had become out of control.  The last straw was when I took a handful of sleeping pills, left a note...drank a half gallon of whisky...and went out in the middle of the highway, hoping to be struck and killed.

Thankfully I got in trouble.  I was forced to sober up, and I checked myself into rehab.  Rehab saved my life.  It gave me hope.  It felt like a new life.  I spent a while in grief counseling, and AA was my new drug of choice.  I was able to start rebuilding the life I had destroyed.  An opportunity to relocate and work in a new field came my way, and I took it.

It has been hard.  The pay is horrible, but in a way I feel like it is penance for my dark years, the years I became a horrible person and let down and embarrassed myself and my wife's family.

Almost 5 years have passed since my wife passed.  I am 1.5 years into what I consider a really good relationship.  I even proposed.  Its been hard but good.  This brings me to the loneliness.

I see so much of my old self in her.  She is a workaholic who is constantly putting me in the backseat if the opportunity for her to make more money (above her normal job requirements) arises.  It hurts.  I want to shake her and tell her to wake up (I'd never shake her or hurt her).  I want to somehow get her to understand how much she is taking for granted.  I want her to stop making the same mistakes I made.  I want her to make our relationship a priority, like I do, but instead her first love is money.  She is open about her obsession and love of money - she just doesn't get it, at all.

Being an only child she is a bit of a self-proclaimed brat.  As hard as it is sometimes, I do love her and I feel like having a second shot at love is something I shouldn't be picky about.  Of course there is a ton of positive in our relationship - but its the negative that has brought me to make this post.

So right now I'm sitting in our home alone in agonizing pain.  I had to have a tooth pulled, and got dry socket.  The pain is incredible.  Where is she?  She had an overnight job come up...for a week.  Did she talk to me about it at all?  Nope.  I don't need to control her, but I want a partnership where we are both involved and discuss the things that affect is both.  These 'jobs' are totally optional, volunteer...in other words she could have passed on it with no consequence other than not getting the extra money. 

The last time she had dental work I took time off, stayed home, took care of her...and nursed her back to health.  I just would like the same consideration.  

So I'm at home, in agony, taking care of her elderly diaper wearing blind and deaf dog (I'm not kidding) who likes to scream at night.

I know I'm whining, I know I should just man up, but god****it I just want to be the priority for once.  I just want her to make me the most important thing in her day, for once.

I've had desperate thoughts.  If I just had someone to chat with.  Maybe post a Craigslist ad for phonesex....something to have some god*mn connection with someone.  To feel, even for a moment, that I am the priority for someone.

Of course, I'll never do those things...but I'm pissed and hurt that I'm even in a place where I'm thinking those things.  So, just talk to her right?  Express these things to her?  Great idea....and when I do, I get all her past baggage projected onto me.  Suddenly I'm the bad guy for telling her all the bad things wrong with her.  Suddenly I'm the overbearing authority figure telling her what a piece of shit she is.... Her words, not mine.

I'm so incredibly lonely.  I feel like I've become a bystandard in my own life.  I feel secondary, second class...and there isn't a damn thing I can do about it aside from leaving her.

I'm so lonely.  I wish I had someone to talk to.  Someone safe.  Someone I can share thoughts and feelings with without judgement.  I am almost 3 years sober....and sometimes I feel like I will lose my sobriety in trying to constantly deal with this and situations like it that come up ALL THE TIME.

I'm sorry for whining, I'm sorry for the childishness of my complaints.  I'm sorry I'm not being a man about it all.  I have always been deep feeling and sensitive, even though I often try to hide it.

Thank you for humoring me.  Thank you for reading my long post full of self pity.  I don't know what else to do.  I just needed to get this out.  Thank you.

14,"Hi, I understand that I am very young and this question may seem very naive and that I am probably worrying a bit too much but this has been a question I have been pondering for a long time. ""Will I ever find someone?""

The thing is, I just graduated high school and in the past two years having been introduced to philosophy I've been thinking about my purpose in life and my future. I've never had a girlfriend in my life and never kissed a girl. I'm a very shy and awkward person when it comes to romance probably because I've just never had the experience and because of my personality. Being a first generation Korean in a high school that is 98% Caucasian and being constantly reminded by the media that white and black people are the norm of beauty, I've always felt self conscious and never really opened up to anybody. I see all these movies, hear these songs and read these books about true love and finding the one but I just wonder if I'll ever have that. I've gone on dates before but never feel connected with the other person or I screw it up by having unrealistic expectations.

I don't consider myself a boring person but whenever I talk to girls, I just can't seem to find something to talk about. I don't really have any close friends that I can be true to myself with because I had to move a lot when I was young. I actually looked up ho many people never marry in their lives recently and 25% of men never do. As I enter a new chapter of my life, college, I'm more frightened than I was before because I feel that I'm behind in the relationship game.

Also, people think I'm this very nice, does nothing bad or illegal, fits the stereotype of being a smart Asian guy but the thing is I'm not like that at all and this really prevents me from opening up to someone that likes me because I wonder what if that's why they like me and if I tell them that I do all these bad things, they'll just judge me and not like me anymore. I'm honestly trying to not care about what people think and just do what I want and say what I want but this drastic change in character is seemingly harder for me to make. It's not like I'm not this nonchalant being underneath, I just can't get over what people will think.

I'm sure this probably sounds really dumb and this post will probably get buried somewhere but I just wanted some advice on truly being who I am before going into college so that I can have a chance of actually finding somebody before I die. I really don't want to die alone.

Yes, having redeeming qualities does help, but even those who lack redeeming qualities can find whatever it is they're looking for. Maybe I'm just confused.

This is a link including a comparison of what Yoga is in two important books, The Bhagavad Gita (a 3000ish year old story about a warrior who gives up and turns to his chariot driver who reveals himself as the wig responsible for all birth and death, where the phrase ""I am become death, destroyer of worlds"" comes from in Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"", and the other book, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, which is a very direct instruction.

Both texts explain that stress is accumulated on a physical, emotional, and intellectual level.
Both texts explain that stress is caused by ignorance, and released through the accumulation of knowledge on a physical, mental, and intellectual level.

Physical stress is addressed and released with physical austerities (breathing practices, virtues)
Emotional stress is addressed and released with meditation (concentration practice, Mindfulness practice)
Intellectual stressed is addressed and released with surrender to a higher consciousness (observing internal actions that behave without regard to your 5 senses, releasing desire and attachment, humiliating your sense of ""I"" and relaxing it with a natural process)

I have been practicing a style of Ashtanga Yoga under an authorized teacher, they're worldwide, and if you have any questions, please reach out.

It really stresses me out to be met with resistance for something I'm so devoted to with such predictable results, so please have an open mind, and I know not everyone will find this interesting, and I understand the infinite possibilities of reasons not to do something, so I'll tread lightly in the comment section, and know that some people spend their whole lives studying this practice to find out answers.

This is not an advertisement for Ashtanga Yoga, it's available in many eastern and western meditation practices, I just find this format extremely accessible and available.

Ashtanga means ""8 limbed Yoga"" - (Yoga means union, or pulling together, seeing the similarities in things rather than differences)  and resources are available in abundance.

30,"So about a year ago I found this video of a cute red panda celebrating their birthday https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFP6xOdAqPA . I just fell in love with the background music. Thing was that no-one knew what it was. I tried recognition programs and different google searches. Nothing worked. I finally concluded that the song must have been made specifically for that video and it was not going to be found.

Fast forward about a year to yesterday. I was doing my usual dilly dallying in YouTube when this commercial came as a pre-roll https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Jv9FrYOZk . It was the same song. My long lost passion to find this musical piece returned, now with newly found passion. There must be a version of this in the internet.

I started googling, cross refreshing, doing CSI-type stuff. Finally after hours I came upon this obscure website. It was like the second page on google so you know I went deep. It had the YouTube link of the first video and another link https://archive.nyafuu.org/wsr/thread/137701/ (I don’t really recommend clicking it, I’m just documenting my journey). Website linked to yet another YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y_CpRpdbjc . Sadly it had been removed.

I didn’t let this put me down. I kept at it. Pasting that link of a deleted youtube video to google let me to this 15 second video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8yIL2rupg . Unmistakably it was the song.  I knew I was closing in on it.

Investigating the related videos on that one I found the full version ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkuRmYNd-rg ). Watching the whole thing through I found that at the end of the video there was a name. Name of an artist Lukas Der Rapped (https://twitter.com/LukasDerRapper).

Now that I had his name I found his YouTube channel, and from there the original song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1SbBXqjrQg . Actually there was no original only a remake. My German isn’t that good but what I gathered he made this song a a tribute to a German lets play YouTuber. Song since got copyright claimed and deleted, which explained the link that didn’t work. He then remade the song in its entirety with some different vocals.

I wasn’t satisfied. I guess I found the source but still, this wasn’t what I was looking for. I was only wanted the instrumentals. This song had a guy singing in German on top it (not that I’m saying that the song was bad just that I don’t speak German). According to the video description he had made the beat. So he must have the instrumentals. They must exist, right?

I went through his Spotify, YouTube channel, Instagram etc. Nowhere was the version of the song I was looking for. It must be his nonetheless. In a final attempt I wrote the name of the song to google, followed by instrumentals “ICH HÄTT’ GERNE KOTT INSTRUMENTALS”. This was the magic word. This was it. This was the holy grail. At the top of the google search page was one hit. A Soundcloud link. I pressed it… https://soundcloud.com/user-880661628/ich-hatt-gerne-kott-instrumental . I had found it. After a year of OCD-like sleepless nights spend wondering. I don’t know who had done it, was it a rip off or was that from the artist himself. All I knew was that my search was over. I had found what I was looking for.


Song’s okay I guess, 3/5.",25May2017,10
32,"Why go through all the complex frustrations of my teen years? I know it'll get worse when we're adults - credit card bills, loan bills, more culpability for anything, and too many more things to worry about.

Wouldn't I be better off dead at 10, then whenever I get tired of the break I'd take in an afterlife after 10, 15 or however many years, I'd go back to Earth reincarnated as another (maybe better) child? At least in better circumstances?

How awesome would it be to be reborn as a kid in 2010? 2015? 2020? 2025? Would there be new inventions and other life-improvements to make a childhood better for kids born later than it was for me?

How would being (re-)born in a later year than 2000, be WORSE for anybody?

And as long as I'm embalmed properly, I'd still look cute even in death, right? Still so cute that my female classmates would kiss me in the open-coffin funeral as they took their turn in line to see me up close and lean over it?

Thanks to ""quantum immortality,"" (seriously, look it up. ELI5 version is on the ""Simple English Wikipedia."") I may be immortal anyway. 

If that quantum rule holds true, I'd just wake up in a different parallel universe, having somehow survived what killed me in the previous one. (Maybe remembering a vague nightmare, if that.)",25May2017,2
33,"I have allergic rhinitis- allergic to my dogs/dust/mold… I have been prescribed Singulair.  But would really rather take a holistic approach.
I have HEPA air filter, HEPA vacuum, essential oil diffuser, reishi mushroom extract &amp; I neti pot 1-2 x a day… I also just had endoscopic sinus surgery. So my sinuses are more open to drain now which should better support drainage but I still am getting inflamed.  

MY QUESTION IS: Has anyone taken Singulair and how does it make you feel? Is it worth it to take a pill every day?  OR have you been able to overcome this with holistic eastern practices?
ALSO: Any type of hypo allergenic bedding helpful? or just a scam?",25May2017,3

38,"I'm a 16 year old girl. My dad walks around the house as he brushes his teeth. I hear his footsteps at 1:00am. It sounds like hes walking towards my room, then he walks away. Then I hear him coming back. Then he walks away. I hate it.",25May2017,0
41,"Here's everything I can remember : 

I'm on the bus with one of my classmates and we are one stop away from the stop he gets off the bus. We're not that close : we talk a bit and stuff. Suddenly a girl comes and sits in the seat near me abd says : ""Remember me, /u/two_number_9s?"" After a failed attempt I look at my head level(cant describe this better, english is not my native language) since i was looking at the floor before. My classmate left without saying anything and he's about to get off the bus. I remember the girl's name and I tell her. She says : ""That's correct.. [small pause]. We should start meeting again, this time I'll like you"" (note:she was in my extra classes for 1 year) 

A bunch of different feelings hit me : first i was really happy, so happy my state could be described as euphoric : It seems that I'm about to make a friend and potentially have a girlfriend! Then I'm kinda weirded out on the way she said ""this time I'll like you"". What did she mean? It's not like we hanged out before, nor that I did something bad against her. If she didn't like me before I guess thats fine, why would she state her change of heart? 

Thats all I can remember. I know for a fact I didn't wake up *right* after that. Some seconds after I woke up I was happy because it's possible that a girl likes me and perhaps I'll get a girlfriend, my first, some days before I finish high school! I remember, however, right after it was a dream and I said (i didn't scream, I didn't whisper, I didn't start crying) ""noooooooo""

47,"I've had this life goal of working in the entertainment industry - specifically in comedy. I've always loved SNL and it'd be such a dream to write for the show or write for any comedy show, really.

At the same time, I'm a fairly smart and logical guy, and I have a stable (sometimes rewarding) career working as a software developer. This has given me a safety net where I don't feel that ""pressure"" to go after what I really want. 

I'm afraid I'll die with regrets.

My biggest fear is unfulfilled potential. My second biggest fear is realizing that I may not be good at what I'm passionate about.

Both of these are pushing against each other and I'm starting to feel like it's affecting my daily life - when I get into relationships I'm afraid to reveal my true passions - afraid that they'll ask ""Why aren't you going after it?"" 

I'm afraid to start going after my passions and having people judge me.

I don't THINK I need to cut my safety net to work toward my dream. But I don't know how to light that fire under me when I've become so complacent. 

I know this isn't a huge deal compared to other people's thoughts here, but this is the kind of thing that keeps me up at night, and I'm just hoping someone can share advice.",25May2017,1
48,"I've had this analogy in my head a while so I decided to try and write it down, hope you enjoy:

If international diplomacy was represented by a poker game where the chips are political capita.

Donald Trump is like a first time poker player who's just joined in and is replacing the big stack player at a table.

He plays consistently poorly, repeatedly going all in with weak cards and refusing to fold, however due to his position and wealth of existing chips he's rarely punished for these actions as other players cannot always afford to risk calling him. As time passes he usually wins small hands, when other players cannot be bothered to bet against him, but other times, when someone actually calls his bluff, he loses huge amounts of chips, but in his eyes, he's won more hands than he's lost so he's best.

He tallies all his miniscule victories and concludes that obviously he must be the best poker player ever to live, after all, the previous player in his seat folded all the time, where as he is consistently winning. He's bleeding away chips all the time but does not seem to realise.

Meanwhile,  the other players at the table are laughing behind his back, in awe that someone could possibly be this incompetent, smiling to his face while ridiculing him in private.

Outside of the game critiques from his own country try to tell him he's playing poorly and making mistake, but he simply dismisses them by pointing out how he crushed Hillary in the rock-paper-scissors selection process. When people decry him for destroying the countries standing other's stick up for Trump, pointing out that if he was bad at poker then how did he win so many hands.

Prior to his presidency Trump played in the private sector poker tournament, where he used a small loan of 1 million poker chips to build an empire. This 'empire' comprised of Trump going all in on 50/50 odds and then declaring bankruptcy if he lost. In the event bankruptcy Trump would simply take out new loan from the casino, and after american casinos stopped lending to him he started borrowing from Russian ones. 

In the international game there is growing suspicion that he is working with Putin to intentionally give away chips to him, and people suspect that this is him paying back. More recently Trump has started accidentally revealing information on the cards he holds, blurting them out to try and impress people. In response to this many former allied players have ceased helping him and no longer wish to tell him what their cards are.


And that's how things stay... 
until inevitably his ""all in"" bluff gets called by another superpower.",25May2017,16
49,"Trump is dominating discourse these days, and I'm aware that there are other things going on in the world, they're just not so visible in the BBC/CNN/Reddit bubble I frequent. I'm not really sure how to get outside of that and be more aware of what's going on in this world. All the shit that's going on in Venezuela, in Africa, North Korea, Chechyna - I'm sure I don't know the half of it.

How do you guys stay informed of current events in the wider world? Do you regularly browse a variety of sources, do you have a few good, broad ones, do you watch TV/read newspapers a lot?",25May2017,9
