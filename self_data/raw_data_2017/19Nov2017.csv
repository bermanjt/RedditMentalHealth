1,"I do this too many times - I respond to a headline rather than the body of an article. I deserve to be embarrassed for doing this and so should others.

One of the problems in this day and age is **assumption**. ",19Nov2017,16
2,"Maybe the title is too much but it's the mood right now. I don't even know where to start, maybe with my horrible grammar and low intellect. I don't feel as though I can keep up with everyone, I can carry on conversations but ether they or I get bored and it just drops. If they do continue  it goes one of two ways: 

They meet my twin, they like said twin and then start comparing me to that twin every fucking time. I get asked how they are all the time, I get asked if I talk to them and even if it is good natured it makes me feel worthless because I hardly have anyone like that. 

2: My negative thoughts get the better of me and I distance my self away. Reason for this is because I'm a fucking 26 year old living with his parents still while they fight and drink all the god damn time. Yes I'm working on getting out as fast as I can, I stopped playing games, smoking weed and have been working out and reading more, if anything just to have a better escape than what the other two were but I'll still relapse on the weed or sit and play games, which while the latter isn't as bad, with the current state of how video games are progressing I have no interest in them anymore. Overwatch is fun I guess and the new Assassin's creed is wonderful only because I have always loved learning about ancient Egypt and wanted to visit that period when I was younger. But I don't like competitive games that much except maybe Tekken, but I don't have a powerful pc or good internet so that is moot. 

But to my original point is that even I still need physical affection from someone else that isn't family. (I love my Mom and will fight anyone who disrespects her) 

 I know or at least have been taught that even if other cultures don't mind family taking care of each other, no woman wants to date a guy who lives with his parents. Or doesn't have a high paying job. Which brings me to my next gripe:

I'M SO TIRED OF STRUGGLING.

At this point I don't even try to live anymore, just survive. Live one day at a time and all that. I don't even have insurance because I can't pay for it. I work at some choose your own hour thing for $15 an hour, which while not so bad, does not really able me to afford much freedom outside of driving to and from the destination. I just go to work, go home and sleep till I get another place to go make money. Rinse and repeat. I try to hike, I try to go out and meet new people but in my area It's just... boring. I can entertain others, I can cook for myself, I can start and hols converstaions, I just don't have any motivation anymore. 

Why should I? I'm pale skinned, I'm universally hated by a loud group because I have ""white privalage"". That's fucking cool, I guess It's my privilege to deal with an asshole condisending father, (if he's in the mood to call himself that) or to live only because I don't have enough energy to go through with the sixth attempt. I just want love. I just want someone to hold me while I cry and get angry. I don't want to hurt anyone, I swear!  

Now with this stupid Net Nuteality thing I've all but given up. Those with the most money win. They always do and people like me aren't suppose to be alive. I'm so weak and pathetic I just wish someone would put me out of my misery. The happiest time I can remember were all during some stupid abusive relationship because at least the sex was ok.

 I just want to sleep forever. I just want to be left on a deserted island where if I can't even survive off that piece of land it would make sense I would die. Over here I have people saying over and over to ""never give up"" like some recycled line from a anime. How long am I suppose to keep at it? How long does it take till it gets better? That's all I'm going off if now, the hope that it will. But that hope is dimming, the darkness is coming back... and I don't want to be in the cold dark again...

Ahh man... I kinda go crazy at work, just saying weird things, delirious, it's a restaurant though so lots of loud noises. Other people emulate what I say too, I don't know.

I just forget how like detrimental this job is despite my sheer hatred for it.

Everytime somebody asks me ""How are you doing"" I jokingly say stuff like ""Ahh I've got the rope in my hand"" or some joke about suicide (because of the job). Or I say other shit like ""Watching my life pass me by"" or ""Watching myself get older""

I don't know... then I have this thing that I project onto others like ""why aren't you successful"" this is what I want. I imagine they may not be satisfied with their lives but who am I to have this pretentious asshat thought/mindset. I don't say it out loud but in my mind I""m like ""Bro why aren't you a striving wantrepreneur listening to podcasts and reading a bunch of shit but never actually doing anything bro?""

It's just funny, I'm dependent on this job that could just as easily kick me to the street and I could quite possibly be homeless. I am in good standing with the managers and I haven't missed a single day in a year so I think I'm alright.

I almost wiped out on my way home today on my roller blades, I noticed this cat on the side of the road on a busy street, I thought it was hurt or something but it looked like it was terrified. I tried to stop and almost ate shit in the process, thankfully it ran the other direction of the street.

There's a girl at work, attractive but I know, she's with someone, don't shit where you eat, etc etc... I""m also just desperate, not desperate enough to not have standards but... I don't know. That kind of attachment/desperation where every hot girl you see, like BOOM she's the one.  I just draw a blank, like I can't think of anything to say to her. But I mean she's comfortable around me and we ""play around' I don't know. I'm ""wanting"" so that's the problem, buddhism right, don't want just be. BE LONELY!!!

Ahh well, gotta learn, try harder, escape, secure my problems and achieve peace of mind or gain even larger problems.

One positive thing though, this scraper that I wrote for someone, it ran today as expected, I had so many dumb problems with regard to permissions.

14,"Three years ago I was dating an amazing girl. She was fun to be around, beautiful, smart, and driven. But my favorite thing about my relationship with her was simply how easy it was to be around her. From the first time we hung out I never felt an awkward moment between us. She made me feel like the funniest guy in the world when she would laugh at my stupid jokes. I could do no wrong when I was with her. It was amazing.

Due to long distance, we broke up. And in the time since, I haven't met a single girl who I feel this way about. When I meet a new girl I struggle to find things to talk about. I feel awkward and unfunny and unattractive. I never feel anything close to the connection that I had with her. It's been quite some time and I'm beginning to wonder if I'll never feel that connection again.

18,"I don't understand how the woman even got the job. I get it a supervisor is meant to supervise and tell people what to do but she is genuinely so nasty to us all. Today I got shouted at for throwing out two week out of date butter because ""she could have reduced it"" - and then when I say ""oh I'm looking forward to my week off"" (starting today thankfully) all I get is a lecture about how she needs it more because she's in ""every day and you're only in a few days a week really, I mean I don't mind because I like working, gotta pay those bills, but you know you're not in nearly as much as I am, but I SUPPOSE I see what you mean"" like you're only in constantly because we are short staffed and despite the 10 applications I've had handed in to me while I've been on shift at various points in the last month, you choose not to hire anybody else, and instead make the rest of us, most of who signed on for 16 hour contracts, work double that if not more. 

Now I know, 16 hours isn't a lot, but I'm supposed to be recovering from a pretty significant mental breakdown, my doctor literally told me I should only really be working a couple of days a week for the foreseeable (which, living at home while I wait to go back to uni is fine by me) and to have to work double that else risk losing my job and then be told that ""I work harder than any of you"" feels like a slap in the face. Yeah, you're a supervisor, it's your job, don't make me feel shitty about the fact you do more work than me because THAT IS YOUR JOB.

Not to mention the fact she makes the same fuck ups we sometimes make that we get shouted at for but she's absolved of it all because she's in charge. She made seven mistakes on her cigarette tally sheet the other day I realised when I was cross referencing to avoid my own lecture, and considering the amount of time she spends lecturing me about one or two mistakes, she shouldn't really have any seeing as SHE ALWAYS GETS THEM RIGHT ON HER SHEET (real words she said to me) and my pay has been messed up 3 times in the last six weeks (two not getting paid the day I was meant to, one where she forgot to tack on some lingering holiday pay to my shifts worked)

I'd quit, but it's that delightful time of the year where all the jobs are only Christmas temp jobs. Either way, at least I don't have to see her for two weeks because when I'm back she's off for a week. The worst part is the higher ups think she's a great manager, but I don't understand how, other than the fact that she comes in early sometimes, and only cos her husband has to go to work at 4am and she can't drive.

35,"In the spirit of International Men's Day, I want to talk about a mens issue that is important to me.
 
 

**To preface, I'm not making any judgements of ""All circumcised guys should feel X"", or ""all expecting parents should do X with their son"", this is just my own personal feelings about myself and my particular journey, no one else.**
 


Before college, I really never gave the issue a second thought, my dick was just my dick, and I was raised Jewish so I was circumcised, didn't think anything beyond that.
 
 

But in college I frequented a web forum where people would constantly get into heated debates of ""cut vs uncut"". I didn't see why there would be much reason to debate, who gives a crap? Many of the people would post links to sources supporting their claims, and that's when my happily-circumcised reality started to crumble.
 
 

What is the frenulum? Ridged band? It turns out, these are some incredibly sensitive areas of the male body, parts that I was missing. It pissed me off, and it still does. Why didn't I get a say in this? I'm not even Jewish at this point, so it was all for nothing.
 

 
It kinda made me feel like my sexuality was the demo version of what it was meant to be. And I can never know firsthand the exact extent of what I'm missing (unless some stem cell treatment comes out in 20 years).


 

 One line from a doctor stands out to me to this day: *The fundamental biological sexual act becomes, for the circumcised male, simply a satisfaction of an urge and not the refined sensory experience that it was meant to be. -C. J. FALLIERS, MD*
 
What bugs me is I'm just expected to take society's word for it that foreskin is no big deal, didn't get to test drive the ""refined sensory experience"" and that feels like a raw deal.
 

 

 

As for the medical benefits I was told of, I found those didn't hold water. As a straight American male, the potential HIV reduction is negligible, and a condom is exponentially more effective and less invasive. As for cleanliness, I already shower... UTI? Just a week of antibiotics does the trick. Phimosis? Turns out its rare and most can be treated without circumcision. So much for those benefits. As for uncut dicks looking ""icky"" to girls... I could care less.
 


And I found myself looking up photos of intact dicks, I noticed they were often way more moist and supple looking. It turns out, without a foreskin, the head of your penis becomes callus to adapt to the abbrasion of your underwear, and this further reduces sensation... Great.
 
 

Another thing I realized is how... mechanically inefficient I was compared to someone with all that extra skin. While I seldom masturbate with lube, it has always felt somewhat... unintuitive, as though I'm trying to dig by holding a shovel upside down. Foreskin provides a smooth gliding motion. And when I'm intimate with my SO, I'm at the mercy of the lube bottle, while many intact guys are good to go without a single drop, their moist glans provides all the lubrication they need.
 
A few years back I found the video of my Brit Milah circumcision ceremony. And let me tell you, its fucking weird. Seeing everyone there for a party, and then in that very room, a guy walks over to you with a knife, in front of everyone as they eat their orderves. Kinda surreal hearing myself cry and scream, like there's no way I could remember that, but it did not look or sound like I was having a good time...
 

 

I don't really blame my parents, or the mohel, or any one person or group for that matter, it just seems to be something very embedded in western culture and I can't point to anyone in particular.
 
 
I did think I had no recourse to regain any semblance of a foreskin, but it turns out there's ways to grow a new one. Foreskin restoration, it turns out has been done by thousands of men to grow new skin via mitosis using gentle tension with various techniques. Its a very long tedious process, and I've hardly made any progress. But the fact that exists does make me happy. It makes me feel like I have a sense of ""Choice"" that I didn't have before. Shoutout to Foregen as well, a company attempting to regrow foreskin using stem cell medicine.
 
So that's the gist of my circumcison journey and how I've come to resent what was done to me. Don't expect anyone to read this, but its kinda nice to vent/write it down.
 
Thanks

But it's not I can always find the money and friends to spend all my free time hanging out, which kind of sucks. So I need something to do alone to fill the void. I've tried painting, drawing, writing a bit, playing guitar, even reading some of the books I've meant to pick up for so long. Which can be fun, and I even think I'm reasonably good at those things, when they do capture my attention. But none of it has the excitement or enthusiasm to it like I used to love being alone and playing games.

But that's okay. I need to learn to love myself and be happy when I am alone, without the old ways I used to fill the void. Sometimes I'll just stare out the window while I leave my stereo playing and just sit there for minutes on end.

If you have any hobby suggestions, please give them to me, lol.",19Nov2017,5
49,"So I've been thinking about seeing a psychologist for a while. I'm having some personal issues and a lot of thoughts that I really need to get out to someone who will listen and help.

I've been debating going, on and off, for a few years now. I haven't been able to fix these issues on my own, so now I'm ready to talk to someone about it.

My question is, has anyone seen a psychologist. Has anyone had periods in their life where they couldn't figure things out for themselves and felt hopeless? If so how did you get over it and do you think a psychologist could help?

Looking forward to reading your answers :)",19Nov2017,6
50,"So here’s the deal, I have been asked to sing for someone. They have an alright studio, lots of microphones, equipment, and instruments. Since I can’t play any of the instruments, they are really trying to get me to sing. The engineer says everyone he records apparently “hates their own voice”. Unfortunately, I do not believe I’m a good candidate, mostly because I truly think I sound incredibly annoying as it is, so singing would just ruin everything. I asked to opt out and instead maybe do a podcast, but they are extremely serious about me recording. 
It’s all in good fun I suppose, but I’m wondering if I should just go for it, or stick to my gut.",19Nov2017,0
