3,"When I was younger and saw this, it was basically ""wait until that guy gets older and isn't good looking anymore"" or ""wait until she gets sick of being treated like crap by him"".  Well, I'm older, and I'm still seeing those women with the same guys, or seeing women who are single (and some even in marriages) who pursue men that are like that... the only time I have ever been able to have a relationship is when the women use me short-term for something (like rebound sex before going back for one of these guys, a couple times it turned out they were using me to leverage back into that person's life so that feels great really) or having to bail on relationships because I'm trying to be the good guy and I just get taken advantage of, then it's just commit to being used constantly like that to have *something* or have some self-respect and cut loose... and then watch them go for those same guys -_-",14Mar2017,0

7,"Hey hey

This may not be the place to ask this and please disregard if not interested in posts about stuff about mentality! Lately I find myself doing 2 peculiar behaviors: 1. very little things set me off into quiet rages ex. friend being annoying, poor drivers (I'm on the road a lot) and 2. often at work I enter severe emotional states from seemingly nothing/imaginary scenarios of me and people arguing or something..very strange! Last week for example, I went into work and find myself in a very bad mood throughout the day (especially the morning), so much that I have to contain myself from cussing at coworkers for no reason! Additionally, I find myself ruminating constantly of embarrassing social moments from my past - and if that's not annoying enough - I will often discover myself mumbling profanities (e.g. ""fuck! fuck! fuck!"", random friend's name, etc.) at these memories when they enter my mind randomly, sometimes in a whisper but sometimes audibly (gets me weird looks sometimes)

Anybody ever experience mental tics like this? Maybe it's anxiety related but wanted to share with the anonymymous community haha!",14Mar2017,0
8,"(Back Story) I have been in college for six years now, i started college immediately after high school and am finally at a four year university.  Now i knew i wanted to be an engineer since before i graduated high school,and have been working towards that goal ever since. After this year I'll still have another two years before i graduate, if im lucky.  The university i got into was at the bottom of my list of schools, the only reason i applied to it was cause i knew id get in. At this school i only know one person and if im not in class im in my room alone waiting for tomorrow to come.

Recently i seem to have no reason to wake the next day.  Im pretty sure im failing 3 out of my 5 classes and dont seem to be learning anything.  I dont have a job( even though right now i could really use the money) so i can focus on school, but even though i have plenty of time to study my ADD and lack of drive or ambition get in the way.  I have no friends really, even back home, the only person i ever hang out with is my dad but he's back home.  I spend so much of my time angry and trying not to explode.  I dont know if i should just quit school and become a welder.  i dont know if ive got what it takes to become an engineer. im tired of being alone. I dont know why im writing all this incoherent babble but i just needed to tell somebody and i guess reddit is the closest to a person i can get.",14Mar2017,3
9,"I've lived most of my life being the chubby kid and never as a desirable person. I turned that around a lot in college, got in shape once I was out of the house for the first time. And with that came a lot of attention, and having never felt this way before, dove into the deep end of that attention, let myself get immersed in it. I'm currently flirting with this guy currently, he's very lonely, overall very vulnerable. It's gotten to the point where he really likes my company and awaits when I talk to him, but a few days ago he said ""I love you"" to me, and I didn't give him the same response but an affirmation nonetheless. I don't actually like him that much, but he gives me attention like I've never had before.

11,"So there's this girl I work with at this shitty fast food place. We both started at the same time and got trained together so we ended up talking a lot and sticking together cause we were 'the new people' for a while. We basically just kept talking more and more, and we get along really well. I've worked there for months now and so I know everyone there now, but I've always been closest with her I suppose. She always goes on in work about how I'm her 'best work friend' and she told me before she always looks for my name on the shift plan hoping we're on together. We would never really talk outside of work at all, but when we're in there we're usually around each other a whole lot. Hell, she even refused to go the work Christmas night out of I didn't go with her. I really enjoy being around her, makes my day a bit easier. She's been working less recently so I've not seen her as much but when I do we always have a great time.

Anyway, while I've had a bad track record for falling for girls who show me that much attention, I never really considered it with her cause she had a long-term boyfriend. I thought she was attractive and whatever but it was nothing beyond the occasional thoughts that go through like every guy's head about any reasonably attractive girl. She was always off limits and so I just treated her like a good friend to chat to. Recently though, in the last week or so she's been talking to me on social media quite a bit. I didn't think anything of it at first, cause at first it was mainly work related. But then she'd just start talking about anything for hours. This happened a couple of times, and usually started with her Snapchatting me. One time she done it when I was actually working, so I couldn't talk to her, but if I wasn't we would have just ended up talking to her more and more. I saw her in work after these messages, and cause she hasn't been working I haven't seen her in person in ages. She talked to me straight away before anyone else, and we talked for a lot of my shift. 

Today she sent me a Snapchat that said something like 'So tired'. All the messages have been like that, ones that seem like she would have sent to everyone, but that I could have replied to and started a conversation over. I didn't reply this time, cause by now I was starting to think deeper into it. Why the sudden push to talk so much outside of work? I mean maybe she just wants to be better friends, but I decided just to do a little digging. Then when I went on her Instagram and Facebook and shit I noticed it. 

She's no longer in a relationship and all the pics of her boyfriend aren't on anymore. I don't know when that happened but I'm starting to think this isn't all a coincidence. I honestly don't know how I feel about it, I've never really saw her in that way before. What's going on here and what's the best way to handle it?

**TL;DR:**Always been friendly with co-worker. Kind of best friends in work. Never thought of her romantically, but recently she split up with her boyfriend and strayed messaging me outside of work. Not sure how I feel or how to handle it. Any advice?",14Mar2017,1

15,"Let's go back to May of last year... I'm 6 weeks pregnant with my second child and I find out my ex is messing around on Craigslist, really getting into drugs, lying, and drinking more than I knew was even possible. I ended things. Few weeks later I started talking to guy that I've always thought was awesome, we worked together at certain events and I definitely knew there was something between us worth seeing about...he's almost ten years older than I am. Anyway, we became great friends, slept together for the remainder of the year and emotionally he was there for me while being pregnant and all. Beginning of this year, I have baby, things get a little weird between us but we have talked off and on and when we do it's great as always. Haven't been together sexually yet this year or since I've had my baby... so friends want me to get over him and move on. Deep down in my heart I feel like there's something worth pursuing though. Fast forward to yesterday, my friend and I go to lunch at a local bar and I begin chatting with this guy, he seems totally down to do more than just talk and after a few months of no action clearly I am too. Not thinking anything of it, I invite him to my house and things happen. Before he leaves we have some small talk and mentions his brother doesn't live far from me  then I realize that he is the older brother of the guy I have slept with all last year. He is also married with two children. I have no idea what to do. We agreed not to mention it considering we both have some pretty good blackmail against each other. I text my guy friend that I really like and told him I met his brother at the bar at lunch and that was it. I never would have done this knowing it was his brother, they look nothing alike and even though I had heard about him and knew his first name, I had no clue what he looked like or assumed he'd be at the bar in a different town without a wedding ring. I feel horrible. Do you think his older +married brother will tell him what happened between us?? Does he know his brother sneaks around on his wife?? I have no clue what to do. Help!! I don't want him to tell his bro before I do if it has to be told. Will his bro tell him considering he has a wife that he just cheated on? ",14Mar2017,1
16,"Hi everyone.

Months ago I overheard my mother talking on the phone. She was saying there was something I did not know yet and that I would be told when the 'time was right', and said my brother may end up telling me.

I have no clue what they're talking about as it could be many things, my first guess was adoption but I have no clue and it doesnt seem logical at all because my family looks very alike to one eachother.

But I decided to do some basic research and here is what I found:
A cancelled divorce record from 2009 does not show me as a listed child.
My brother has a different middle name from what I have always been told it was, which is Spanish.
My mom has a different maidan name then what I know, and is connected to a whole different family, also Spanish, but some records also still connect her to the maidan name and family I know.
There are two different last names too, one being my brother's middle name.

My grandparents on my mom's side have the maidan name that I'm used too and are not Spanish at all. There are no hiccups on my dads side.

And now I'm back home. And nothing has changed. At all. Literally everything is the same that it was in 2015 for me.

Yet I feel different. Oddly different. Off.

I don't feel depressed anymore, for what feels like the first time I feel happy, I've been socializing more than ever and kicking ass in school, and my life has become way way more comfy than it was in 2015, let alone the last hell of a year.

26,"On the 24th August 2016, I was diagnosed with leukaemia. I was a teen and was ready to have my second year in college (UK not US) and this changed my life. 

I used to be a very depressed individual. I looked at things very negatively and I got stressed out at tiny things. I failed in my gcses but managed to come back from it and get good grades when I studied computing at college, although I was still very gloomy and had a negative outlook on life. 

Then at the end of summer 2016 I was diagnosed after an eye test picked up on retinal haemorrhages and I had to have a blood test. This affected me and my family a lot. But ever since then, my outlook on life has completely changed. 

I suddenly realised how valuable life is - and when I had to stay in the Christie Hospital (cancer hospital in Manchester, UK) this changed how I am. I have rapidly been improving on my treatment and I only have to take tablet medication (imatinib).

I have been taking online courses before I go back to college in September, I've made proper friends (for the first time in my life), and I have learned new skills like cooking. I have got more invested into my hobbies, like wrestling and football, and I've been enjoying myself.

I really just need get this out as I'm it comfortable talking to other friends about it.

I was in a relationship with a girl for 10 years. Sex was infrequent and sort of caused me mild anxiety but I loved her and didn't think sex alone should be a reason to leave. The whole time we were together and was fantasizing about a lot kinkier stuff than I knew she would ever be in to. Fast forward a while and we break up and I decide to play the field, have a few hook ups, explore my sexuality. The first person I go out with turned out to be pretty amazing. I didn't want a relationship but I couldn't deny our chemistry and quickly developing feelings for each other.
Fast forward a few more months and I'm in love with this girl, she's everything I ever wanted and aboot of things I didn't know I wanted. Only problem is I'm weirdly jealous and insecure about her past sexual experiences. Partly because I'm so inexperienced and feel inadequate and partly because they're experiences I've always wanted. I know she's been with more than a few handfuls of guys and for some reason she me motioned how info uncomfortably large one of them was. Of course I get the normal 'I don't measure up' insecure feelings and she tells me I'm silly, she didn't like it that big (I can't help but think it's bs) and she says she wishes most of them didn't happen and she's super happy and satisfied with me but I can't shake the feeling that she's just saying that to make me feel good and I sometimes get the feeling that she's taking a lot of her pleasure.
Sometimes I have a hard time staying hard as I'm lying there thinking that she's remembered more exciting times.... I feel like part of it is also jealousy because I wish to have multiple partners and one night stands but most of it is me not knowing what her experiences were and imagine them being crazy exciting fun that I can't give her and will never experience myself.
I know she loves and wants to spend the rest of her life with me and I feel that way about her.  When I've tried talking about it before she says that she would love me and want to be with me even if we didn't have sex, which I hear as 'ya sex isn't that good but it doesn't matter to me'

42,"I am in a quasi-open relationship. It is really strange, we both really want to be together yet neither of us are willing to do a long distance relationship. My reasoning being I have done them multiple times and it never works out, and hers being the same. We met in Japan, she's Japanese, however she goes to Uni in Scotland. She won't be back until summer so we decided we would ""date"" in the summer and do our own thing while apart. We also agreed that if we found someone else then that is just how life works.

I really like her, we talk at a minimum of an hour a day with most days going 3 or 4 hours talking on the phone. We have plans for the summer to go traveling together and we talk about our hookups with other people to each other. It doesn't feel unnatural or weird, we can literally talk about anything and I feel no attraction to any other girl I have been with since she has been gone.

We do literally everything a couple would do, call in the morning to wake each other up, make sure we say goodnight before the other goes to sleep. I have literally stepped outside on a Tinder date to make sure I call her and tell her goodnight/good morning, and in one situation good luck since she had an exam. We watch movies together on Skype, she gives me Japanese lessons (free personal tutor is dope) and we are going to have our own little ""book club"" since she hasn't read many American novels and we are going to talk about them. Starting A Series of Unfortunate Events next week actually. Got each other Valentine's Day gifts, we are dating without the label essentially.

I still hookup with girls frequently, but I tell them up front that I just want to fuck. It's strange having this kind of a relationship even though we aren't together.

It's going to cost $7000 to ship my things. At first I thought everything would be fine - one option was to present the invoice and a filled out check to be preemptively reimbursed.

So today I took all of my repayment agreement information, six months of paystubs, email correspondence from my relocation agent, etc down to the bank.

50,"There's always a fight between practice vs theory. 

Most view it as something that should be combined, fused. But lately I've been thinking that they although they should be used together and synergistically, they should still be separate despite complementary.
I started to think about this by reading Jung's work on dream interpretation. Jung placed a significant importance of dreams, more than Freud. He believed they could give information about the secrets of inner life and reveal to the dreamer hidden factors of his personality. And therefore could be quite useful in therapy.

But it wasn't exactly scientific, and it wasn't very well understood, so there was a good reason to be skeptical of it. And Jung himself was very aware of this.

However, he found value on it. Even though it could be very random and hard to interpret, if properly done, sometimes, it yield results. And results that couldn’t be achieved by traditional methods. And he argued, from a therapist to patient perspective, that that's all that matters. He wanted to know more and how it worked, but that was his own goal as a scientist, but more or less irrelevant for the patient. It was his own selfish curiosity, but that shouldn't overcome his main goal of helping the patient. That's the highest priority to be a successful therapist, to help the patient, regardless if you understand how you did it or not. A moral obligation per se. He still wanted to understand it, but that was a separate action, beyond the therapist-patient relationship.


So you can think of it as 2 personalities. One being the practitioner, which its sole goal is to help the patient. While the other one is the scientist, which seeks to understand how it works and all it's nuances, so we can have a better understand if how the world works and get closer to truth.

The first is important to actual help the client and get stuff done. However, that's not enough. You need the second, because that will help you to help other people in the future. If you don't understand how and why it worked, it's hard to make anything out of it. It may have helped in that specific situation, but it might not be helpful at all in any other context ever. But if you understand it well, perhaps you'll have the knowledge to modify it and make it work in a different situation. And that's of course assuming you even identified the cause correctly, which is insanely hard. It's very possible that's just it's a random correlation, but that's another point altogether, and one of the main goals of the scientific method.

You always use the knowledge you already have to try to solve the problem, but that won't always work, because our knowledge is incomplete. Sometimes that will work, but sometime it won't. And when it doesn't, and that's where more direct experience and experimentation comes in. The more recent and complex the field is, the more important it is.

But for this to happen you need to admit that there's truth that you don't yet understand, due the gigantic complexity of reality.

This is in part of how Jung's practice was built. He used the foundations from Freud, Adler and many others, but that didn't always work. And when he found things that did, he took that and slowly built his own, modified method/philosophy. And people after Jung did the same with his own work, and the people after that will continue to do so. And so overtime, after decades, centuries and millennia, the model improves, and we get closer and closer to truth.

I'm probably beating a dead horse, but I really like an analogy Aldous Huxley used for this is his Doors of Perception, which is the Platypus. Theoretically, it seems very improbable, or even impossible. At the time when European naturalists first discovered it, it didn't match the knowledge we had at the time. It's a mammal... that lays eggs, with a tail of a beaver, with feet like otters, and on top of all that, it's poisonous. Like, what the fuck? At first some people even thought it was a hoax. But nevertheless, it's real. And that truth can't be ignored, even if you don't understand it at first.

And the world is full of Platypuses. Things that exist, but we do not yet understand. But that doesn't mean they aren't true. And for the practitioner, it’s of the most utter importance to be able to em",14Mar2017,2

52,"Back in the day (3-4 years ago) it was fun to watch channels like SargonofAkkad (and Internet Aristocrat for those of you who remember). It was before the strange SJW VS. Alt-Right meme war became a thing. It was just some silly people on Tumblr who took their feminism a bit too far, and the rest of us who just made fun of them. 

All of these ""anti-SJW"" channels overtime gained larger followings from the Alt-Right and I can't help but feel like they are pandering to them to max on their views. Its no longer about ""lets poke fun at this stupid SJW"" but ""how this is a planned agenda against the white people"".

54,"I am afraid of living an ordinary life.

I am 22 years old, and I will be starting medical school in a few months. My life priorities are as follows, in no particular order of importance: 

(1) To live a life in which I may use my intelligence and work ethic to truly serve those in need, and help people become healthier and happier. 

(2) To be an explorer and a discoverer. Whether that means exploring new and exciting locations in my personal life, or working at the cutting edge of science to expand what is possible for the human body. 

(3) To be square with my spiritual philosophy - to meditate, pray, act ethically, be cognizant of the miracle of each moment, and most importantly to help others. 

(4) To be there for my family and loved ones.

(5) To maintain my own personal health, both mentally and physically. 

(6) To inspire others on a large scale, and accomplish great things. I guess this is the most ""out of my hands"" priority, but here it is. My idol is John Glenn - astronaut, pilot, senator, and engineer. I know that's a tall order, and I don't think I'll ever be as awesome as John Glenn, but hey it can't hurt to dream right? 

Anyway, I make this post today because I've been thinking a lot more about time and death. I don't want to waste any more time, but I also think that I need to have clear goals so that I have something to work for. I have heard that the biggest difference between people who only dream and people who actually accomplish those dreams is discipline. Well that, and opportunity. 

John Glenn's Wikipedia page begins as follows: ""John Herschel Glenn Jr. (July 18, 1921 – December 8, 2016) was a United States Marine Corps aviator, engineer, astronaut, and United States Senator from Ohio. In 1962 he was the first American to orbit the Earth, circling it three times. Before joining NASA, Glenn was a distinguished fighter pilot in World War II and Korea with six Distinguished Flying Crosses and eighteen clusters on his Air Medal.""

If I had to make my own Wikipedia article, I would want it to begin something like: 
""woof_iamadog was a physician, inventor, teacher, explorer, and statesman."" Hey, shoot for the moon and you will land amongst the stars. I have no idea how I will accomplish any of my goals, other than becoming a physician because I have been accepted to medical school.

Am I thinking about this all wrong? Am I thinking too much - should I just let life happen? If I focus too much on greatness, will I lose sight of what's ultimately more important: ""goodness""? Do people who accomplish great things have a life plan, or do they just go with the flow and be awesome at everything? lol 

Yup, just my rambling thoughts. Didn't mean for any of this to come off as arrogant or ignorant. Just a dream I suppose, but I hope I can work it into a reality. And even if #6 doesn't work, I hope I can do #1 through #5. 

Thanks for reading. Any advice?

56,"Okay. So I'm here in Taipei for 24 hours. I didn't book a hotel because I thought it'd be a waste of money given the short amount of time Im spending here. 

I arrived a 2 am and now it's 5 am. I don't really want to share my observations on Facebook or Instagram because I intend to lay out the most mundane, or the weirdest, or the must fucked up thing I see on this trip. 

It's gonna get pretty random so hang on to your butts.

First off, I arrived at Taoyuan Airport and took an hour and half long bus ride to Taipei. Nothing to note really at the airport... Well maybe except that a lady, who was right in front of me getting of the plane, was suddenly cordoned off from the herd of passengers heading to immigration because the thermal cameras detected a fever or some sort. She was thoroughly examined and every passenger was put on hold while she was examined. Eventually, after a considerable amount of probing and poking with all manner of instruments she was taken to a quarantine area. Question, what happens if she does have a contagious disease? Is she sent home? How about the other passengers who have been allowed to leave, will we be called back and quarantined as well? These thoughts swirl in my head as I'm heading to the immigration area. We were in a metal tube with her, enclosed with recirculated air for 2 hours... The thought of the probability of catching whatever shes got is making me..nauseas.

Never mind that then, I move on to the bus. It was for the most part uneventful... Although I did struggle with myself deciding on whether or not to recline my seat or not, given that somebody was positioned behind me.... I decided to do it halfway.... Semi-win Semi-win (or semi-lose semi-lose?) for us both :) you're welcome bus stranger who probably doesn't give a crap about the moral battle I had waged against myself on his behalf. 

Get to the bus station and no stores are open at 4 am. :/ walk about 2 kilometers looking for an open McD's...in a dark alley someone suddenly calls out to me. I don't know how to speak Chinese so I assume he was politely and respectfully asking for some loose change...sooo, I hauled ass outta there, stroller bag in toll making the loudest gravel hitting plastic wheels sound scraping through and piercing the veil of silence in the dark alley ways....

Out of the distance, by the grace of the gods, the Holy golden arches appears. And lo and behold, a 24 hour sign perched next to it. Woohoo...all that 1mimute running sure can bring up an appetite. 

So here I am... Sitting in McD's with a cup of coffee and a dying phone. 5:35am and I'm thinking of the next activity... If you've made it this far, two questions... FIRST, Whyyy? SECOND, any suggestions for the next item on my itinerary? 

By the way, notable observations while I type this... Guy scratching his balls and ass with his arm elbow deep underneath his jogging pants in full view of the world...Taiwan Numbah 1 so Fah!

Update 7AM: Still here in McD's. Decided to catch up on my reading. After 2 cups of coffee and a bottle of coke zero I am still finding myself micronapping. Will head to the closest museum once it opens at 9am. The Taiwan National Museum if I am not mistaken. 

Notable observations, there are a lot of homeless people here in McD's and they are the tidiest bunch of people here as well. They all clean up after themselves before they leave. Return treys in the proper shelf. 

Shame that this doesn't happen in my home country, homeless people would probably not have been allowed to enter the establishment in the first place. :( 

Ok back to reading.

Update 8:30 AM:
Won't try to make fun of this. Man collapses in front of me while I am sitting on the bench. He was walking on the pathway we he suddenly stumbles. He tries to get up and keep walking three times then falls face flat on the ground. 

A few pedestrians come to his aid. He hasn't moved much since. He looks conscious but he can't stand up. He also keeps pointing to his heart. 

I wanna help but I'm afraid I would be more of a burden with the language barrier. 

Either way, an ambulance has been called and the man is on his way to the hospital now. 

This is a pretty strange and slightly morbid  turn of events. 

What would you have done in a situation like this? Was keeping silent the right thing to do? 

.... 

On the lighter side, I spotted a squirrel on a trash can.... It gave me quite the stink eye for a minute or two. It looked like a legitimate aggressive stare down. I haven't been around squirrels that much... Are they dangerous? 

Here's are pics of the incident and the squirrel death stare. http://imgur.com/a/9WRzh",14Mar2017,11

This has lent me into some big troubles lately with my closest, and I want to change this to somehow help rebuild our relationships. My main problem is that often I do not even know that I am arrogant. How to spot it, how to avoid it, how to change my attitude? Thank you for your responses.",14Mar2017,4
