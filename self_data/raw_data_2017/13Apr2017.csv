2,"I think that the pains of donating a kidney seem very minimal in comparison to the good that it would achieve. I am in highschool, and I don't have any foreseeable obligations that my recovery would render me unable to fulfill. Is there really any reason that I shouldn't go through with this?",13Apr2017,6
4,"I'll start from the beginning.I have a sister(let's call her Lily) and a brother.(let's call him Luke)I love them both very much.

My sister Lily is 23 years old and she is not only my sister, but my rock and best friend.She's.  beautiful,smart,kind, and outgoing and was finishing up her masters in chemical engineering.(On my other posts I actually put electrical engineering silly me)She has always been there for me and I love her with all my heart.My brother Luke is 11 years old and is adopted.My mom's best friends(Luke biological parents) died in an automobile accident 7 years ago and so we adopted him into our family.It doesn't matter that he's not genetically related to me, I love him with all my heart as well.

About 2 months ago I caught Lily and Luke in bed together naked.After questioning the both of them I found out they have been having sexual contact for more than half a year.My sister begged me not to tell anyone and promised she would stop.After a post on r/changemyview and an internal debate I told my parents.My parents proceeded to kick her out.Them they went to the police even though I begged them not to.

An investigation occurred and a judge approved an arrest warrant.My sister turned herself in and a bail hearing commenced.Bail was set at 20000 and even thought My parents are affluent they wouldn't give Lily a penny for bail.I got to speak to my sister for a brief period of time after the hearing and we discussed bail.She only had 13,500.Fortunately, I had 5000 saved up that was supposed to pay for a school sponsored trip to Spain,but went to pay for her bail.The other 1,500 was made up by Lily's best friend who gave her a loan.

My parents were notified that Lily was put on bail and they questioned me because they knew Lily wouldn't be able to afford bail.I admitted that I helped bay for Lily's bail and they got really angry.They grounded me for the rest of junior year(I'm 17 and female if that matters) and My parents told me I may have to move out and live with my grandmother in Baltimore because I'm an apologist and a potential danger to my brother.(which is complete bs because I love Luke and would never do anything to hurt him.)

My brother isn't doing all too well right now.He's been going to therapy, but his usual energetic demeanor has changed.He's now quiet,gloomy, and almost depressed.He keeps telling me and our parents that he misses Lily.He's seeing a therapist right now and everybody is working non-stop to help Luke.

Honestly I don't know what do anymore.My family is falling apart, even though I tried everything to hold it together.Everything was fine before all of this happened.Now I might be kicked out of the house and moved over to Baltimore to live with my grandmother.I have nothing against Baltimore and my grandmother and I always got along well,but I don't want to move.

What do I do?How do I keep my family from crumbling?",13Apr2017,1
8,"I don't know why, I just don't. For instance, I was just watching Survivor (reality show on an island), and one contestant outed another as transgender. Everyone was shocked and appalled, and the former contestant was unanimously voted out. I was confused and upset, because I wondered why, in a game where you are playing for 1 million dollars, they would choose this player (relatively weak and isolated) over another player I had in mind (extreme physical threat) simply because of emotion. It made no sense strategically to vote this person off, it was something the tribe did because they were upset, and I felt nothing but anger towards them for making a move that would not help them towards their goal. 

In short, I simply find no feeling in me for these emotional experiences, and I'm not sure why.",13Apr2017,1
9,"Being lonley is a death sentence. No one ever to talk to. Feel like i bother people to much. How does anyone live with this alone feeling. Why have i always been an outkast? How do you change this? I dont want to be alone forever. Ive had one real GF and im a month away from my 26th bday. I mean i ocasionaly use those random date apps (POF, Tinder,Meetme) but even there no one wants to talk. Like i can message people and never NEVER have i gotton a reply from people. Am i just fucking useless? What is the point of even caring about what i do in life if i have no one to share the experiences with? I mean i traveled around the whole USA but i was alone so no one will ever know the expierience and withy anxiety i basically saw sights from my car but it was amazing! But theres no way to even tell those expierences. Im not against going again ever but it will NEVER be the same. How though do people live entire lives alone. And why am i so shunned?

12,"Ok, bleak title, but idk where else to place this.  I'm an emotional tornado, depressed, hopeful, sad, happy, it's all so brief until the darker feelings seep in.

I'm graduating college with a degree that covers many things in communications but my SO doesn't want to leave the state like I thought they did.  Idk if they even still love me from the weight I've put on past the couple years of being together.  Idk if I can find a job after graduation.  My SO plans life differently from me (I plan every second of my life), and I feel like I'm going crazy for giving myself hope about the job possibilities I'd like to have and grab but probably can't for various reasons. 

Then there's the spiritual side of my life.  The older I get, the more I believe in spirit guides, the universe, just mere gut feelings and intuition that my SO doesn't believe in.  And I feel like they internally make fun of me for believing these things and essentially having my own religion.  I don't blame them, I believe in science like they do, but right now, science doesn't prove anything besides the physical benefits meditation had on the body and brain. Nothing beyond that.  My SO finds it a waste of time to do things that are good for the soul like mindfulness and meditation.

I know they don't need to believe in what I do but they shouldn't be so... negative about it.  Idk what to do with myself, im split between me, my SO, my future job, school, and my intuition....",13Apr2017,2
14,"I'm so frustrated and upset. I've always been a bigger girl and I've always hated it. I'm trying to take better care of myself but exercise has always been something that is just hard for me to do because I simply don't enjoy it. 

Recently a friend and I decided to try taking some pole dancing classes and I fell in love with it. Our first class, a girl was there I knew and she just so happens to be the wife of one of my biggest bullies from several years ago. He was incredibly mean to me in the cruelest ways possible. Constantly making fun of me because I was fat and just non stop ridicule and harassment for a few years and he thought it was hilarious and so did all of his friends. When I say they were mean people, that's an understatement. I believe these people got off on being complete and total assholes to any and everyone.

Tonight, while scrolling through my facebook feed, I see that he attended one of the classes. I immediately got sick and started crying. Knowing that he could now possibly be there any time I decide to go is honestly terrifying to me. I don't think I can face seeing him, especially since I have gained a lot more weight than when he last saw me and use to make fun of me. 

I don't know what to do. I'm so frustrated and I feel like bettering myself is a hopeless cause because the town I live in is just small enough that shit like this happens.

I'm sure it's probably a one time thing so he can laugh with his friends about attending a pole dancing class but I honestly cannot face him seeing me in such a vulnerable position and being put in a position again for him to hurt me like he has before.  Those wounds stick with you and never fully heal. I  feel so stupid for letting this have such an effect on me but I just can't help it.",13Apr2017,5
15,"We met at work and have been together a bit over a year. Our relationship has never been super stable but I told him I loved him after 8 months and I meant it. Over the last couple of months, things have been extra rocky. We've probably gotten into an argument about every week. It was grating on both of us. I haven't felt like he's satisfied my physical or emotional needs.

One night after as bit of drinking, he left his his iPad playing music all night while we were sleeping. He told me he sometimes does this when he sleeps alone. The morning after, I wanted to see what app it was because the interface looked unfamiliar so I pressed the home button twice and accidentally discovered his secret Instagram soft core porn collection. No big deal. I understand that's not out of the norm and I was curious about what kind of girls he found attractive since he would never talk about it to me directly.

Over the next couple of weeks, I've been more curious than ever to learn more about him. I start work later than he does and I have his place to myself after I stay over. I started looking about his backed up images and text messages with his best friend. There were lots of hints that he was sleazy, but today I dug deep enough that I know for sure. 

He's been lying to my face about wanting to work remote together and go on vacation together, when he clearly told his friend he had no intention. He's obsessed with Asian massage parlors and has been going to them before our relationship as well as during the course of it. He has regulars and even his best friend who lives across the state refers to them by their names. He cheated on me during his last vacation which was supposedly a boy's diving trip. He used to be a scuba diving instructor years ago and now he's telling his friend he's in his prime now. He's getting older, he'll be 34 next month, but he still feels young and has money now.

He has so many double standards for me. They're just too ridiculous to list. When he's upset at me for something, I now have evidence that he is so much worse. 

I'm just tired. I feel cheated. I feel like I've wasted so much time. Usually it's way easier for me to pick up on scumbags. I'm not sure what to do. I don't feel like bringing all this up to him directly. I want to tell him general break up reasons like, ""I can't see a future with you, we want different things, etc."" The place we worked at was a very close knit company and now we work in different offices and don't have to deal with people directly. I guess I don't want him to say bad things about our breakup. I want to let my closest work friends (who are now at different companies) to know about this. Is that a terrible idea?

Earlier tonight, I cancelled our dinner and brunch reservations for the weekend. I also cancelled a birthday dinner reservation for him. I feel like these are the first baby steps. I've thought about breaking up with him a lot before and never followed through. I guess through all the turbulence the relationship faced, I still really enjoyed his company. He's smart, funny and a bit of a dork.

Before him, I was single for about 5 years. A lot of that was because I was traveling a lot and because I enjoyed the dating scene. Now, I'm getting older and I've gained some relationship weight. My self-esteem is not in a healthy state like it used to be. I joined a yoga and cycling gym yesterday and have already gone to 3 classes. This is the first time I've channeled negative energy into something more positive thank drinking too much and laying in bed all day. I'm a little proud of myself. I've told some of my closest friends that I'm going to break up with my boyfriend but didn't give details. Everyone has been completely supportive and they want to spend time with me to talk about it. I felt so numb about all this in the morning but now I've just started crying uncontrollably and shaking over writing the last paragraph or two. One of my best friends who lives in Australia and whom I haven't seen in years just texted me back and gave me some very supportive words. I think that may have to do with the crying a bit too. Anyway, I think I got out all I wanted to say. I'm looking forward to being free again. I'll need to learn how to open up myself to love and trust again. I will followthrough with the break up this time.",13Apr2017,12
16,"So I've gone through a bunch of things this past few months.

I was diagnosed with cancer, and as a result, had to stop smoking (smoking wasn't the cause of the cancer, but the smoke would basically kill my lungs and heart during chemotherapy)

Chemotherapy was shit. I was smelling urine everywhere for a whole week from when I start a session. I really wasn't that afraid, just after some time, my veins would start hurting (same veins where the needle went in) and developed a phobia of needles.

With all this now behind me (cured of cancer), I understand how some people say cancer sucks..But honestly it was just the chemo that sucked, being nauseous and shitty. 

I don't get how people make such a huge deal though, I didn't feel any different (emotionally and physically) during and after treatment, just felt like I have a cold and have to get this needle poked in me every couple of weeks for 6 months.

Also with the smoking, been 6 months since my last smoke. I don't feel any healthier, I don't smell or taste things better, I feel absolutely no different, other than wanting to have a cig after a nice steak dinner. I had to quit cold turkey, and I did; no big deal. I even have my cig pack on my desk, yet I don't smoke it.

TL;Dr had cancer, got cured after chemo. I don't understand why people make a huge deal about it. As a result of cancer, had to quit smoking cold turkey with absolutely no issues. I don't understand people 😐",13Apr2017,0

It was a rocky road but either way, I'm ending* with a 3.94... a .05 difference from an honors robe (after this sem ends I'll have a culma. 4.0).

20,"One of my wisdom teeth is infected for the second time since early March. They'll be taken out in May. This has been SUCH an ordeal. I feel so dumb that I put this off for a long time because I was afraid of doing it without IV sedation (I learned I can get it now for $1500. However, these infections have made me realize I would do ANYTHING to have these fuckers out of my fucking face and I don't even give a fuck about sedation).

I'm not sure which part is the worst. The tooth pain is the worst pain I've ever had (including dislocating a knee and continuing to teach small kids the rest of the day!). The insurance BS is the worst insurance BS I've dealt with (okay, maybe not the worst, but it's bad, especially since I didn't have the option to front the money and be reimbursed. This is what you get for having poor person healthcare and going to a franchise dentist! Yaaay!). But also, the antibiotic is maybe the worst I've ever been on.

I have SUCH bad luck with antibiotics. I'm allergic to penicillin and all related antibiotics (not a serious reaction, but I guess they still can't prescribe it). Others have a huge chance of making me itchy, hivey (those go on the no-no list, I guess), rashy, or nauseous. 

I hit the jackpot with this one. Mild itchiness, horrible splotchy red all over my face, and AWFUL nausea, especially the first day. I'm now spending another first day of antibiotics tonight, vomiting my guts out (making taking painkillers fun!) with *horrible* tooth pain and a headache from the tooth pain to boot. It's bad enough to prevent me from sleeping even.

The only lucky thing was that this happened now and not last year while I was living in Asia.

I have a phone interview in the morning for a job I desperately need. I just want a job. I need this and I'm so afraid that this is going to affect my performance. I'm already so scared of messing this up. I just want to be able to start to actually afford medical (semi-)emergencies. I just feel so hopeless.

23,"Here is a very simple instruction:

* Set a timer for your desired length of meditation.
* Sit upright on a chair, cushion or rolled up towel, with your back straight.
* Close your eyes. Breathe through your nose.
* As your breath rises and falls, bring your mind gently to the feeling of the air moving in and out around the tips of your nostrils. Keep your mind there.

As you do this, other thoughts and feelings will arise.

Maybe your foot itches. Maybe you've got something you want to do immediately after you get up, or two days from now and it keeps coming to mind. Doesn't matter.

Note these thoughts and feelings as they come up, try to avoid judging them as good or bad, just notice they happened and gently come back to your breath.

Under the more detailed discussion of types of meditation, this would probably fall under mindfulness of the breath.  ",13Apr2017,7

30,"##Throwaway.


I've been skipping school for various reasons since I was probably in 4th grade. Some of the reasons have been class presentations or speeches, assignments that I'd procrastinate on or didn't want to turn in quite yet (wanted to see what other people turned in first just to make sure that mine was ""perfect"" or ""up to par""), anxiety issues, and just having an overall lack of enthusiasm for school which has been declining throughout the years.

&amp;nbsp;

I am currently in college; my 4th year. It's been very difficult since I have depression and social anxiety as well as some self esteem issues. I went to uni for my first year - made some regrettable
 decisions - then moved onto a local community college where I stayed for 2 years, and now am enrolled at a vocational school. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm really happy with the program I'm in; I keep up with the work for the most part; I've actually made some friends at my new school; I earned a 4.0 GPA last semester; but I'm slowly falling into my bad habits with skipping school. I always seem to find one reason or another to miss. I feel so ashamed that I do this to myself especially since in the past it has caused even more depression and social anxiety. 

&amp;nbsp;

I can't bring myself to tell my family or my boyfriend. They all think I've been doing better although my family has mentioned that I seem a little ""down"" lately. I really don't have much to be sad about but I am anyways. I'm on medication for it and I felt like I was doing better but now I'm unsure what to do.

&amp;nbsp;

The reason isn't completely because I'm afraid of the social situations that come along with school; I just hate going. Whenever I've been employed in the past (currently unemployed and looking for a part time job) I've been a really hard worker and rise above and beyond and have been regarded by my employers as a pleasure to have. I just don't know what to do with myself anymore. I'm so scared that I'll end up ruining the rest of my life because my ""bad habit"" will start to affect everything else in my life and that I'll never get a good career and that my boyfriend will have to support the both of us (if he would even put up with it, he doesn't know how bad I've been feeling about everything). I'm so mortified with myself that I feel like I lack the motivation to fix it.

I went to bed: terrified and excited. These past few nights I haven't been able to sleep because I kept thinking of him. I know that sounds so lame and cheesy, but that's honestly all I could do.  I had a dream that he said no and, while I was disappointed, I was fine. I expected it as a matter if fact, but I needed to try for once. I woke up this morning to him saying yes! I made the girliest scream in my dorm, so I'm glad my roommate wasn't here this morning.

I've never had a boyfriend because I've always been so shy. I'm not saying he's going to be my boyfriend or anything, but if it goes that far than I'm excited! If not, then it's ok.

34,"I'm wondering as usual about life meaning and existence itself. I've been examining my thoughts and patterns. Seeing my algorithms studying them learning why biologically i tick the way i do just like any other species does. Higher self acts, Love unconditional acts kindness being warm to others, Examining lower self-emotions and actions. They are the same aren't they? I wondered between those two following emotions drives us for the better? Or is it the logic behind it? Or is logic just another diguise that tricks one into thinking they know when they don't. I've had a story i pursued it that's what i've been doing my whole life. I thought i knew better, Everytime i looked down on others and their pity acts i judged and said i am better at what i'm doing but then i knew that i was no better, Even after improving a lot on myself the illusion showed me i got much better but i still wasn't any better as i had my own share of blind spots, What hurts the most is everytime i feel improvement as i've walked a long hard path invested a lot of time into it, I felt my conciousness got way better accurate and meaningful it got shot down harder than ever seeing that it isn't. Even rejection of the real world when you know you've tried so hard for your own self value is just the most devastating ever. Even as i knew it's all an illusion in the end. We keep projecting self deceptions eating our time and life. I have yet to explore some more chapters of judgement and the subconcious mind as i've been studying them for quite a while. It makes me wonder why do i irk to control the world? Why can't i just let it be? It's none of my buisness and beyond my power. Yet a sweet voice in me just wants to be accepted. I accepted myself but i know neither of it is true and what's painful it's impossible to be truly accepted as people always have their own laws that will gush you out. I wonder if there will be a day where i could truly share myself with the universe and be happy with it as it is. I wonder if there is someone out there for me that really understand and cares sincerely as much as i do. Yet it seems impossible my fairytale is nothing but of an innocent 5 year old wanting a one time fantasy princess sugar coated destiny which is ruined beyond fixing. I've heard things off my own family which is beyond me, I can't even put it into words as it is something i just can't believe. My dad wants to remarry even after all these years is a shocker to me and my sister encourages him? Am i crazy? Is this even real anymore. I know this is far off learning about myself but the very core value rules of me wanting to be a devotey geniunely makes me feel like i'm probably sick. Yet again why wouldn't anyone want to share themselves with one and only one true fantasy that is iireplacable? Guess the universe is perfect and not perfect at the same time. I just can't understand the laws in my head anymore. As it's just crazy nonsense.. I've affirmed myself chained myself to one where i even went beyond my biological instincts to even look at other woman which is pretty crazy for someone with my ridiculous hormones. I've gone beyond my biological instincts training my thoughts to think in such ways where i can't seem to break out of habit. I probably could? But i don't want to what's the point of me looping? Am i a broken weak machine i wonder Am i even making sense to myself? I'm not even expressing myself well enough.. I can't be bothered i've had these thoughts running for a while just wanted to vent them out and let them go. Yet again i keep telling myself let go but it never happens. And that is a part of myself i have to accept? Accept being an idiot and keep being one theirs nothing wrong with that. Why bother? Why take life seriously as i am the punch line joke here thinking it's all meaningful. Not special just a copy of what's around, not special just a biologicla tick, not special just automated yet thinking it's not. Not special doesn't even know how to use itself. Exists but doesn't. How ironic.. 
The very base the very outlook of the people i knew changes, They are not my core value even when i put them on a pedestal they fall and make me wonder why do they choose those acts, are they aware? They say they are aware and think things over yet can't see their own shame. I see my shame, i see how vulnerable i am. I am not afraid of it but i am at the same time. Being selfish is key to get things in life? Not always it can work both ways, Why bother picking sides? Why not have them both.. It feels like a dirty play but that is how life is it's unfair isn't? I hate that i prefer trying to be clean for one myself and the people around. With some slight stupidity as i see myself as a special smart stupid. Yet i'm aware this is all a joke. I wish someone were to be there forever yet i feel like i would reject people who don't have the ability to understand me. Compatibility does that exist? Choice that does exist.. Neither do exist.. Try hard try not? 
The tornado goes on and on with a loop of low awareness while think it peaks on awareness as it picks out what it wants, It's quite staggering and sad when i realize how stupid this is yet i can't control it knowing how bad the algorithm is because it's really a very limited control as much as i want it all i've accomplished a lot yet i've accomplished nothing. How sad, The one thing i know is i know nothing and percpective is everything. I just want to cherish this moment that i am alive i've experienced a near death experience that makes the spark of my life everytime things get worse it's truly nice to see that i still have this breath and mind even if it's broken atleast it still works not as good as before but it's better than nothing. Even though i've damaged it with bad choices it's still better than nothing. We all don't calculate our lives well as we just don't have enough informatiotn before we take our next move which is why it's an experience that never goes wrong. But it does go wrong when you speculate how much better you could've lived it as we age if we knew what we knew years before. It keeps happening every year to years. This is quite normal. I feel like a high core value that could tell people what to do as i'm aware of their flaws but yet i can't fix my own mind isn't that strange. Taking my own advice and own bitter medicine is hard, i don't blame the people around me yet i wish they'd listen me out even though i'm not very vitally important to them. Why the care and need to show myself to be so important when i know i'm just as petty at lying just like the rest of the dreamers that are asleep? We're all on the same boat, we're all lying and ongoing it's alright let's take the ride till death it'll all be ok eventually. Years from now when planet earth is done i wonder what remains of time it's quite a miracle we even exist by accident. The emotional and logic lies are quite funny. The intution of when someone says they know and just because it can work out or it doesn't makes me just facepalm at that idea. Why do i shreek at existence it's already the perfect imperfect why not just say thank you for letting us even have that experience? Why do i feel like we should all be more important when we aren't? What is this game of life we never asked for we never got to choose. Yet it's all there forced on us. Quite a silly beautiful non duality quite some art. 


Edit: At every moment, at every sight more conditioned patterns are followed and entertained, the very core of us is met and never really us, Examining it closely is there a way around it and say i am aware? we fall asleep quite fast we don't even understand what is it we are aware of the glimpse we have is very minimal it takes years to actually reach a full awake enlightened state. Trail and error is one's teachers as much as simple as it sounds

Edit: Just had a radical percpective shift when i talked to my brother in law, he told me about the days of how my mom would smile as my dad entered to her, as he was her care taker. He told me about how much he loved her and things he said of how the lights would go out in our house as she passes away. He lied to me in order to encourage me to change and be stronger than whatever staggers my heart. Even if it's my own fantasy i have to outgrow it and have courage to be vulnerable to pursuit more. That is the message my dad tried to show me. Although i find it difficult to trust animlistic instincts.. They are usually rubbish with lies..
My brother in law talked about a girl he knew where  she divorced her husband and kept seeking for sex simulations from people who never loved her even when she had it all, It's quite strange she even got her kid aborted and asks people to keep cumming in her or whever, I don't understand that kind of life why even seek that? Why am i judging that, I'm confused.. He fell asleep tired on the sofa i covered him up we had a good talk about life. I hope we can talk soon. He made me nearly cry when he talked about mohammed. It's like i saw a glimpse of my past relived. I didn't want to stop him. I didn't want to lie. I just don't know what to think of it because afterall the creator created everything right? Everything is divine.. Even this is misleading.
I plan to deepen my knowledge of buddha,jesus,mohammed,hindisuism. As they are all signs of the divine being there for a reason they all have wisdom behind them. I'm sure i'll pick up some prophet traits from them that are cliche of treat others with kindness even if they were bad to you as that is their unconditional love of being with 7amd all the time of the present moment. It's a lesson of enlightment they all have and were trying to share but it's lost as people can't decipher how deep that is.

35,"I'm 19, atheist, male, black, about 5 feet 10 inches and weight 135 pounds, I live in West Palm Beach, FL. I currently attend college, but not for long because I enlisted into the Marines and I'll be shipping out in September. 

I live in a gated community, (I'm not rich.) and hardly ever leave the house except for college and physical training at the recruitment center. I'm an introvert​ and kind of a loner, but I do appreciate interaction, I prefer being by myself often. 

I don't have any ambitious goals in life. I just want to live in Arizona with a decent house under $70,000 without any homeowner associations. I'll have a couple of hobbies like stargazing  and wildlife photography. I plan to make my life in the military a career, so I'm going for a full 20 years. After military life I plan out trying out for a park ranger.

I don't want any kids and I plan on having a vasectomy later in life. I don't want to get married and dislike cohabitation. I also dislike having pets. I don't see marriage, kids, or romantic relationships as necessities for me to live a happy life. 

My current interests include watching anime, reading manga, video games(although I hardly play anymore I still like to follow up on current events). 

Feel free to ask any questions.",13Apr2017,2
37,"It was September of 2015. I was an eighteen year old university freshman. I was a nervous, anxious barely-adult woman twelve hours away from home with depression and a low self esteem.

And I got into a relationship with a far older man who used BDSM to mask his massively abusive tendencies. He was controlling, manipulative, very quick to cause fights, and I wanted so badly to make him happy. It quickly became where I had no self worth beyond a desire to make him happy. I was his girl and nothing more.

He once broke up with me on a roof top. We were two hours from my campus, in a major city. I had no money. None. Not even enough to pay for a cab, much less a bus ticket back to my university. He forbid me from going back to the event downstairs. My cellphone was dead, and the event was due to go on until three in the morning--and it was barely midnight. I was running on no sleep whatsoever because I had pulled an all nighter trying desperately not to fail a class.

I had to beg him to give me another chance, because if he had left me on that roof top, I would not have been there come three in the morning. I would have found a short cut to the pavement below.

My counselor told me that was an act of supreme violence. It was. She told me she herself would have jumped in my situation.

Even so, he forbade me from telling anyone what was going on, and to smile like everything was okay. I think that was the night I became truly numb, and I only recently fixed it.

That was early December.

So much of me was lost because of him. I was always with him on weekends, so I never did social events. Never made friends. The friends I did make, I never saw.

Then....Winter break came.

And I went home. Twelve hours away. And never saw him again.

Until this weekend. Saturday night.

I was in his city because my boyfriend and I were attending an event in the flat next door to his. He had some of my stuff, I had some of his. So we met in the hallway.

When I saw him, he was a person. There was no anger. There was no fear. I was more terrified when I got to his area of the city because of the memories! I was shaking when I walked into the building, but actually seeing him was...nothing.

He ruined me, or at least, I thought he did.

He's not a monster. He's a person. He's a man.

And he deserves to suffer for what he did to me, and to the many other girls that have come forth and called him an abuser. But....He's not the monster under the bed anymore.

He's the monster that I evicted for good, and left in his place barely even a shadow.",13Apr2017,4

39,"So one morning I woke up early. I checked nintendolife.com and saw that Lego Star Wars the Force Awakens had been announced. I used to really love the Lego Star Wars games, (even though I didn't like Legos or Star Wars) so I decided to watch the trailer. My dad walks in while I am watching it and notices I am watching a video. Me being embarrassed to watch a trailer for a lego game at my age I try to hide it. I move my Wii U gamepad (yes, I was watching it on Wii U I didn't have anything better) in a way that he cannot see it. I wasn't fast enough in moving it though and he saw that I was watching a video. My dad: ''What are you doing?'' Me: ''Nothing'' Dad: ''What video were you just watching?'' I decided to just go ahead and tell him what it was despite being embarrassed. He didn't believe me and asked to see it. I give it to him and he realizes that I was telling the truth. Ok so he never actually said that he thought I was watching porn, but I am pretty sure that's what he thought. Sorry if the writing is bad I just wanted to share this story. ",13Apr2017,2

46,"I don't know where else to complain to...  I feel like I've no reason to keep fighting every day.  I don't want to give up but I don't see a reason not to.  I'm 34, been diabetic for 25 years now.  It has caused me many health problems.  Most notably nerve damage, which causes me anywhere from mild to unbearably excruciating pain.  Pain so bad sometimes that I can't even move for fear of triggering other pain.  It's horrible.  The nerve damage has also caused problems with relationships in the past which makes it difficult to keep one going.  And as someone who prefers not to be single, it's very disheartening.  Recently I dated someone who I thought didn't care about any of it.  She did, in fact.  I truly thought she was the one but she ended things very abruptly.  Not to mention she has two wonderful kids that I became very attached to.  I love and miss them dearly...

It makes me feel like no one will ever be willing to put up with the bad times because the good times aren't enough or few and far between.  Basically I'm not worth the hassle.  My health has prevented me from keeping a steady job so now I'm relying on disability to carry me through which makes me feel even more pathetic and worthless.  No woman wants a man who can't take care of her if need be.  And any good man should be able to take care of the woman he loves if he needs to.  I hate it so much...  I've never felt this alone and meaningless.  Yeah I know people love me and care about me but I don't think they care anymore about how sad and lonely I really am.  It'd be different if I could change things but I really can't.  I'm not giving up but I'm not really willing to fight anymore...",13Apr2017,1
47,"I've been painfully lonely for a long time. Not really any friends, and no girlfriend.

I've always considered myself pretty unattractive. I see some funny posts on /r/Tinder a lot so I decided to install it just so see what it's like. It's like a cultural icon at this point and I've never really seen it or seen anyone use it, so I was curious.

Anyway, I made a Tinder and I got a match! Hooray!",13Apr2017,3
48,"My teacher evaluated my project today which went fine. The small stupid moment was when he handed me a page to write my name and today's date. I've always been bad with knowing what date it is, but today I drew a total blank minus what year it was. I asked him what day it was and he tells me the 13th. A burst of anxiety makes my heart race because he didn't say what month it is. I can't ask because there's people around and I don't wanna seem stupid. The teacher watches me put the pen to the page and hesitate. Then  the answer came to me in a 50/50 chance. I was thinking April or May. Thankfully I got it right...",13Apr2017,1
49,"I'm sorry for bothering everyone with this. It's not anyone's concern beyond mine, but I just feel like I have to put this somewhere.

I'm a junior in high school but also am taking a college class at a local community college. It's unique in that the class is a college-level course but taught only to high school students - it's a special version of the course specifically for that purpose. It meets every weekday, and is one college course on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and a different course on Tuesdays and Thursdays (two college grades, one high school grade for both of them). It... isn't going great, let's say. A lot of the other students don't take it seriously, and spend a lot of time shouting about vaping, drugs, and stupid stuff. The teacher doesn't do anything about it, and it's upsetting to me as well as infuriating. I could go on with specific examples for quite some time. I do my work as well as I can and never missed a day.

As a junior (and the only junior in this class), I had to take the SAT. This happened on Tuesday. I informed the teacher, multiple times, that I would not be present on that Tuesday, because I am taking the SAT. It is a reasonable thing to be absent for.

I get there, and on Thursday (because, remember it's a different class on Wednesday), I ask if I can take the small quiz given on Tuesday. The teacher says I can't, because I was absent. I had informed him of my absence and it was for a good reason. I went and asked one of the deans about this, because I knew this couldn't be right. Indeed, there is a specified exception in this program for SAT tests - all content on that day may be done at a later date.

When I get back, I find that, while I was gone, I had missed ANOTHER test, which I also could not do. I said something about how I just got back from asking about the last test, and the TA turned to me and said, ""Jesus Dude. Welcome to college."" It was very condescending and it was clear he thought I was being a baby.

At this point, I started to have a panic attack. I couldn't have missed two tests, I *couldn't*! And then, another student yelled at me, ""Shut the fuck up! Nobody cares that you missed a stupid fucking test, so leave the fucking room or shut up!""

This was about 7 hours ago. I've yet to fully come off of the anxiety attack I got while this was happening. I went back to speak with a dean again after class, to inform them that I missed another test as an indirect result of not being allowed to retake the first one (which I was supposed to be allowed to take again anyway) and could barely speak.

I'm sorry for bothering all of you. I'm just... I'm still so frustrated and angry that I signed up for a college class and ended up with this...",13Apr2017,2
