1,"I was reading something a moment ago, and it resonated with me that that I consider the ""single biggest issue in my life"" is how to turn fantasy into reality; to actually get around to doing stuff instead of just thinking about it forever until I forget, or the opportunity is long past.

Then, almost instantly, another thought hit me: this is a first-world issue, you have no real problems if you consider this your ""greatest issue in life"".

I don't know where to go from here. It completely clashes with my usual mental atmosphere, and I know the implication that I'm a bad and spoiled person if I have the ""luxury"" of a fantasy life. My ""single greatest issue"" isn't keeping body and soul together, or surviving an illness or external threat, it's actually living in some full sense. I think that's bad. Something something ""you have no right to be depressed, angry, or ever feel bad, you have it so good, you're so privileged"". I don't fucking feel privileged. On an intellectual level I guess I can realize I'm pretty privileged, but I loathe gratitude and merely want more; I just have a different starting point for my desires than would someone with more basic needs to fill. Sure, I'm materially better off than a lot of people, but that...doesn't mean much to me. Maybe my mom's right and I'm basically the devil, I just can't embrace it. I know I'm a narcissist, which explains this entire damn post, but the constant messages that being such is wrong still affect me. My thought process basically went that since I care so much about something so abstract, it means I'm spoiled, and therefore bad, therefore my desire is bad. Or I need to be ""grateful"" and guilty for existing as I do for some reason, because I have this ""luxury"" of having fantasies and dreams. Or I'm confusing myself.

Help me hash this out? Mostly about that immediate emotional contradiction of ""You're a privileged POS because your greatest issue in life is trying to act instead of think.""",27Aug2017,1

4,"The whole point of this is to show that there is less hate than what is being reported by the media. Love thy neighbor and learn to get along with each other. We all live on the same planet. 

You might say ""but there are still more hate crimes out there than these ones we find out are fake."" Yes, but we don't actually know how many are fake. People get away with a lot of stuff, including false police reports. We only know of the ones who were caught. Additionally, the media nationally covering the original claim, yet failing to adequately cover the correction, causes people to get riled up and act out violently against others as a response to these fake hate crimes. This goes for both sides, Fox News and CNN, etc. Hate crimes are great for ratings. Corrections are not. 

The first batch will be a bunch of fake hate crimes blamed on Trump supporters and/or the KKK, etc. The second batch will be fake hate crimes blamed on Black Lives Matter, Black men, etc. 

Most of these were also covered by the national news, but the correction didn't see much publicity. They often just correct the original article without posting a new one, long after the facts are known, so that only a very small number of people see the correction. Local news does usually post a new article, but it's just local news, which only local people see.

14,"I am a very bitter angry person. I won't pull any excuses as to why I am this why, it is largely the consequence of my own actions. I am a cynical and conniving person.

That's great and all but yeah now what. Any two bit fool can figure out their problems, but acknowledgement and improvement are worlds apart. What is a quirk in your personality vs a glaring flaw. Who am I changing for? Do I even care to change for myself or should I do it to be a better person to those around me and as a functioning member of society?  

I realize from my (often hurtful) interaction with others that I have issues that I should work on. You know, since they can be hurtful to others. I don't think I'm very empathetic or sympathetic to those I care about.  I'm not a good human being by any means, but I want to work on myself to be decent at least. All adults are decent people I believe, so this is a pretty major aspect to work on. 

I've seen I learn best through experience but usually its an event or an altercation that flares and after a period of detachment I'm able to reflect and improve myself. I have stopped repeating the old mistakes, but *there are a lot of issues* so the mistakes are fairly often. It also isn't a great thing to hurt others in the process, I have no right nor should I do that. 

It's about time I took a good long hard look at myself and try to make more of an effort to improve. 

Again **that's great and all** but how do you do that.... Like seriously, this is a pretty simple coming of age story. 

**How did you, fellow posters, grow up to be an adult? How did you face your own demons or observe how other's dealt with it. How did you come of age. What was your journey like in improving yourself? How did you learn to take full responsibility for your actions and treat other's with deceny? And finally, what do you believe is a functioning, mature adult?**
 I realize it is a personal experience for everyone, but I could use some concrete advice 

[Take for example this list](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/artificial-maturity/201211/the-marks-maturity)

I dont' think I can be a fair judge of my own character. I'm too deep into it without the bias and need to cope and self protection to properly evaluate and sort myself out. *even with that caveat* I can tell I am definitely not emotionally mature, and probably not mature in other ways. 

I don't think I'm a functioning adult. I don't think I'm as mature as I should be for a mid 20's adult. The clock is ticking, and I can't keep spiraling in self pity, that won't help anyone, least of all me in trying to achieve my goals. 

Take for instance my inaction on lofty goals: I have a desire and I know I *should* donate my time to causes that I care about. I recognize I've had opportunities afforded to me based on factors outside of my control that other's have not, and I would like to try to help others to the best of my ability (if I may be so vain). I've found a two voluntary organization's to pursue but as soon as I go to fill out the form I just drain of interest and pin it for later. 

Later? When the fuck is later exactly? Do I mean never? Honestly the cognitive dissonance is astounding.

18,"For the record, I'm 17.

So I recently almost got the called the cops on me and two friends, both 17. Basically what happened was we saw this party nearby so we decide to crash, thinking it would be fun. We come in, only to see its some old rich guys birthday and we stay for a bit before deciding to leave. Then as we leave the house, a woman approaches us and asks where our parents are. We try to say that we were waiting for our parents but the lady pulls us inside and locks the door. By then I already got wind of what's coming up. She then pulls us into their living room, takes a picture of us, and demands we tell her out names and social security, as well as drivers licenses and tells us that if we lie or do anything, then she'll call the cops on us. She writes down our names and takes a picture of one of my friend's divers licences. We stand there while she goes somewhere else, and she comes back and tells us to be honest. We basically tell her that we saw the party and thought it would be fun to show up. She tells us that she understands we were just dumb kids and she leaves for some reason. We stand there for a bit and what I think is her husband comes in and tells us to get out. We start walking out and the wife looks confused, but both want us to call our other friend to come pick us up. The husband tells us to go to the street corner and if we do anything else, he'll call the cops on us. Our friend finally comes and the husband tells us to get home safe, but takes a picture of my friends licence plate. 

This just happened and I'm kinda scared shitless and I'm not sure what's going to happen. This all happened in a rich neighborhood and I'm scared out of my mind about what could happen.

19,"My GF and I met in college. I'm four years older than she is. I was in grad school and she was an undergrad attending the same college. The first year of our relationship was great. Sure there were fights and normal stuff but the fights dealt with us. However, since the election, she's been interestingly combative.

While I dislike Trump and think he's a pretty terrible president and I didn't vote for him, my GF really hates him. Ardently. As Trump does more and more ridiculous shit, she's basically losing her mind. News alerts on her phone. Constantly talking about white privilege, voter suppression, healthcare, Russia (remember how that was a thing like 3 weeks ago?), and on and on. I think those things are important for sure and I'm fine with her feeling motivation to get out and go do stuff and even proding me a bit to join her, but it's all the time and I am damn tired hearing about it every waking moment of my life. 

She ruined my birthday outting two months ago (just dinner and going out with friends) by dominating the conversation with this stuff after I expressly told her to shelve it before we went to dinner. A few drinks in her and it just came pouring out. Several attempts were made to shift the conversation but she always steered it right back. We were supposed to be out all evening but I could tell people were getting tired of her and when it became apparent there was no end in sight, people started to make excuses and leave early. I didn't blame them because I wanted to leave too. Finally, I just put the few of us remaining out of our misery and ended the night early. I was so mad I wasn't even able to process how mad I was. We went home and went to bed.

The next day, we had it out. I was eating breakfast and she comes in and gets food and sits down. She says that she had a good time last night. I retored back asking if she was fucking kidding. She looked bewildered. I had resolved to bring it up later when I wasn't so angry but that statement set me off. I just laid into her. I told her she ruined the whole evening with her politics bs and that's why everyone left and we went home early. I told her she was being selfish for not letting me have my birthday celebration by doing something I expressly asked her not to do. I told her frankly that she was damn near insufferable to be around general. She tried to retort but I told her I didn't want to hear it and left the apartment. 

I came back hours later and she apologized and promised that she would work on keeping politics out of everything. I accepted and let it go and thing were good till Charlottesville. It's dredged up the same old habits again. I really think that I'm about ready to walk away from this relationship. I can't take listening to her anymore. It's gotten to the point where I just try to avoid her as much as possible.

20,"I have never been comfortable with the idea of having sex, and over the years, became more uncomfortable with my sexuality as my unorthodox preferences became apparent to me. Over time, I grew to hate my sexuality, and began to see it as both a burden and an itch I'd never be able to scratch. I once quipped that if I could make a wish to a genie, it would be to have no sex drive.

Well, the anti-depressants I've been taking seem to be granting that wish. Slowly but surely, my sex drive is whittling away. I masturbate infrequently (once or twice a week) compared to how much I used to. I haven't felt attracted to a woman in real life in months.

It's absolutely liberating, and has freed me to focus on other things. I hope I never get my sex drive back, and fear what would happen if it were to return. I would be content to die a virgin, and there's a distinct possibility I will.

So, the next day I took her to the store and showed her the cookies. They were still on sale and they had more varieties. I asked her which she wanted. When she didn't say she wanted some, I said good things about two varieties, and suggested getting those. Before leaving the store I asked her once again if she wanted to get cookies.

Afterwards she was blaming me for not getting cookies. The idea was I should have chosen to get cookies independently so she would have cookies now. Well, I didn't choose to get them myself because I think cookies make sense as an occasional treat, not something to eat every day, but I never discouraged her from getting them, and actually encouraged her. Yet she was acting as if it's my fault.

27,"Hello reddit,

I'm a male and a fresh grad who got cursed with bad ageing, turning me from somewhat decent looking dude to what some people would would say ""a somehow fucked-up face in a manner that can't be explained"". I was never a text-book good looking guy, but apparently I got some ""cuteness"" factor, which to a great extend gave me a slight edge in crawling trough every day life. I was never aware the importance of looks, until I experienced the effects of ageing on my own skin. I can tell you one thing - ageing fucking sucks and in the following paragrapgs I'll try to illustrate what changed for me.

#1  - women.

 Damn it Joe, but dealing with women became such a struggle. It's like 80% of women have like zero interest in me, but it's not the disinterest that's the most annoying - unfortunately there are so many straight rude and disrespectful women that I have to deal on daily basis and I have never experienced anything like this before. I would say that before the inverse was true - 80% of women were either respectful, where many of them were nice and interested. At this point I would call ""beauty is in the eyes of beholder"" as complete bullshit in my case, because in my experience the effect of looks is universal. 

Back to rude women - this became almost unbearable.Getting cringes from random women on the streets is pretty normal event. Many times I try to return fire at least with showing a middle finger, but I found this bit risky because two times already I got threatened by their guido-gorilla boyfriends. Then it happens that I get skipped when waiting in a like like I'm not there and as soon as I complain I get ignored or trigger a conflict in which I'm aggressor and they're victims. This sucks. Dealing with cashiers and other face-to-face customer service is a complete crap. Everything is so hard for them, in fact it's so hard that they can not do it without sighing or eye rolling.

I stopped approaching women, in particular ones in clubs and parties. Some of them just disapprovingly stare in me for some short time while making that uncomfortable half cringed face , nodding with head and not saying a fukin word, while other go with good old ""fuck off"", ""go away"", ""OMG!"". If I'm lucky I get a normal ""no thx"". Some of them just ignore me and act like I don't exist, like i'm made out of glass or something.

Night one stands and casual sex. Just no. Definitely a thing from the past, maybe I would be able to pull it off with ugly and/or fat woman. It's funny when you mention word sex or start talking about sex with woman - if you pass the looks threshold she giggle, if you don't, she'll give you that ""what the fuck do you want?!"" looks and feel threatened.

#2 - Social life.

It's way harder to make new friends, as many guys are simply not interested. But at least the the attitude is tolerable. It's true that some guys can be dicks too, they're rare and the rejections (in the sense of making friendship) tend to be polite, political and in the light of integrity - they speak with me for a few mins and then they move away with some crap excuse. But however you look at it, this large scale saga of rudeness, bullying, humiliation, exploitation and childish behaviour, as experienced from women, is simply not present.

I would also like to point out an interesting finding. I have found that if there is anything that makes women systematically respecting me or even interested in me, that would be the money. And my profession. Nothing else is so consistent in changing woman's mind as it's the money. When she sniffs out that I have bucks, something simply ignites in her and whole image of me is constructed completely differently. Some of them even start to emit that sex vibe which I used to feel before going into one night stand, and this happens just because of money. This is scary. 

#3 -Job search
It's much harder to land a position, in particular if it involves dealing with clients. 

In the end, I would say that my quality of life significantly decreased. Basically I can't afford that extroverted party life anymore, and having short term fun around with women. Social networking is a challenge, finding a job is harder and there higher expectations and less space for failures when performing job. 

Now the solutions. One is to cope with some bullshit philosophy so long that I get used to this crappy lifestyle, while the other solution may in fact be a solution to problem, but it's controversial. 

As my ageing seemed to be very suspicious I have visited my GP, not caring if he sends me to shrink or not. To my surprise he sent me to plastic surgeon. I visited specialist who inspected my face and his conclusions very surprising:

""with ageing our soft tissues lose tightness and as a consequence they start to slip down the face, which gives that older look. One is even more prone to this process, if he doesn't have good bone structure to support tissues. Your bone structure fits in this category. Your face is flat and your both upper and lower jaw are placed too backwards. We need to bring them forwards to make a better support for soft tissues. At the same time your overbite would be fixed.

When we age we also lose volume. Your fat pads in the upper part of the face are a bit thin. This is improved by taking fat in your stomach and injecting it in face area.

However, in any case you would need your jaws fixed for most significant improvement. It's a major procedure with corresponding risks so think about it.

30,"...the top post over at r/cat_girls for over a week has had a subtle r/NekoIRL watermark on it.

I used to be one of the top posters at the former but had a falling out with one of the mods. About a month later said mod also alienated a second of his big posters who took it upon himself to start r/NekoIRL.  Now I just really like girls with cat ears so I started posting there (and later was made a moderator). Upon finding out that we had started a new sub the cat_girls moderator announced his intention to xpost all our content to his sub. I mean don't get me wrong, this is petty, silly reddit drama but it's been really fun growing a sub from scratch, attracting new contributors and creating a community but it's not like I'm going to go out into the real world and talk about it:

 ""How was your day dear?"" 

""Well my subreddit for girls with cat ears reached 6000 subscribers!""

Anyway, since the only posts on cat_girls are the mod's alt account xposting my content, I've been trying to hide NekoIRL watermarks on my posts. He catches most of them and then finds different versions of the photos...which to my mind is more work than just finding your own content *shrugs*...but he missed the latest one and so the top post has my watermark on it. I've actually seen an increase in subscriptions this week too...possibly unrelated but it makes me smile and since nobody cares I posted it here.

But you can't turn down either TV.  You can only turn them both down.  But then you're only living half of life because it's twice as much at half the volume just to seem normal to you.  That's no good either.  

But living two realities at once can't be done.  When one is constantly trying to figure out, for sure, for example, how many other people are in the room with one it takes the fun out of life!  But if one removes one's ability to question the number of the people in the room, one also removes the very capacity of fun from life!

32," I recently got myself a new job aswell. I was ready to tell her but she beat me to the punch. 
 All I know is that it's gonna suck at my job now. The truth is, I freakin' love this girl. She's an amazing person and I cant stand the idea if not seeing her again. 
 One things for sure, I need to quit this job. Feels like everything is falling into place. My new internship(paid), and my friend bringing me i to his production studio to do some freelance work for some of his clients. 
 Of course that is the main focus of my life. But as for her. She's the first person I connected with after coming back to this city, and she's been an angel on my shoulder since. 
I don't want this to be the end.",27Aug2017,8
33,"I have not had a friendship last more than a few years, since I was a kid. I was bullied in school. I was left behind by everyone. I always thought that it was the other people ruining our friendship, it was never my fault.

I met my current best (and only) friend a little over 5 years ago. Longest friendship I've had in my whole 25 years. But I keep messing up. I'm bipolar, I get angry and confused and I make a lot of mistakes. She also has some mental illness that she's trying to deal with. I've been on steady medication for years, but I still have an anger issue.

I wanted to hang out yesterday, we hadn't seen each other in weeks. We were texting, I was trying to make plans, but all of a sudden she stopped responding. I was mad, I had a crappy week and this just pushed me over the edge. Two hours went by with no response, and in my anger, I sent a mean text, basically saying that I get she doesn't want to hang out because of her silence and to have a nice night. She came back with some excuse (what I thought was an excuse, later turning out to be completely true) but I threw it back in her face instead of just letting it go. I was tired of people not acknowledging/caring about me, I get it at work all day long, I don't want it from my friend. She brought up how she helped me the past few years when I was dealing with being diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

I brought up how she ignored me last week until she had her mom call me, asking why I was mad at her. Which is a whole other story but whatever. She came back with how she's just a fuck up. I tried calling her, but her mom answered. I could hear her crying in the background. Her dad was yelling to me, ""thanks (my name)!"" Most likely for upsetting her.

I spent the next 3 hours thinking about what I said. And what happened with all my previous friends. I'm the reason why no one can be around me very long. I sent my friend an apology text, asking her to call me if she wanted to talk, but she won't. This isn't the first time I've fucked up and hurt her. 

K K. N G. L C. S L. A A. K A. A O. E R. K H. K A. P K. E E. B M.

The above letters are the initials of all of the friends that I've pushed away to the point where I believed it was them hurting me. Looking back on it, it was my paranoia and anger that ruined everything. I can't keep friends or a boyfriend. I don't even think my parents like me that much, or the rest of my family. I don't know what is keeping me here. I don't understand why I can't change myself so I don't get so messed up. I guess I need to learn that being alone is probably better than continuing the cycle. I'm going to miss my friend, but she will be so much better and happier without me.

And to all the girls that I blamed for ruining my life over and over, for 15 years, I'm sorry it took me this long to figure out that I'm the problem. 

Tldr: That's ok. I just needed to get this out of my head. It's mostly rambling about how I'm a shitty person.",27Aug2017,25
34,"Last year I was doing an internship at a company for 3 months. Over there I met a girl who was my team mate. As a result of being in the same team, we ended up spending a lot of time together. Apart from work both of us use to go out together for lunch, movies, sometimes shopping etc. Though it was more like we were friends, rather than a sort of romantic relationship. On the other hand we grew very close during that time. Somewhere along the line I began to really like her, though she had a boyfriend then. Once the internship ended we never did meet, on the other hand we did chat a few times, quite a lot at the start and now maybe twice or thrice a month and I believe we still are quite close.

Fast forward one year, I still really like her, and because of the time I spent with her, I end up comparing anyone else I meet with her and feel like the she was perfect. I'm scared that I'll never be able to meet or experience anything like the moments I spent with her. I keep thinking about her and it gets me depressed. Whenever I see pics of her with someone else I get jealous. I know a romantic relationship with her is impossible (we'll probably never meet again, but I still keep hoping miraculously we do) but I'm not able to accept that and this is destroying me mentally.

If I could get rid of all my romantic feelings for her and think of her merely as a friend that would be the prefect outcome.

I do realize that people have been through similar situations before and the most common advice given is to end all contact with her...but I mentally I'm not able to do that. The best thing would be for me to block her on all social media but I really don't want to destroy our current relationship..I'm probably speaking in circles now.

Any suggestion or a different perspective about my situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. ",27Aug2017,2
35,"Hi,

I would like to know what kind of thinking, feelings, you experience when you have empathy for someone. 

I ask this because I don't think I'm able to have true empathy for people.. I have few friends, I enjoy the way I feel when I am with them, I enjoy how they give me confidence in myself, I enjoy expressing myself outloud without fear when Im with them. I like making them laugh and I like having their attention.
But I feel like I feel nothing for them. I think Im better than all of them. That they lack the qualities I need in people, which are originality, theatricality, passion and excellence. 

Just now my only friend told me she needed a short break from me, because she cannot take my judgemental personnality anymore since it's starting to affect her. I feel like a monster and I wonder once again if I have a narcissistic personnality disorder. I have a massiv ego but it's made of sugar. I break under anything. Im the most breakable person in the universe. Zero self confidence and yet the ego of a demi-god. I love talking about myself so at this point I might just be enjoying it.

I am able to feel protective, to want to make people feel better and to want to help. I compliment people too much. Low self esteem might be the only thing I have empathy for, because I know just too damn well how it feels.
So back to my original point, how do you describe empathy?",27Aug2017,8
37,"I don't know why I still think about the person I cheated on. I don't know why I still care about what they do. I don't know why I care that she has a new boyfriend and she's happy. Why do I feel so dead inside because of it? I met someone loving and caring when she didn't care, or showed that she still did. Why does this affect me so much? I have a bright future but I don't give a shit, I feel broken over something I helped cause. I'm an awful person and I deserve this. I deserve this.",27Aug2017,1

42,"I can't stand the way i look,yet I keep looking in the mirror (or any reflective surface) and critiquing myself. After showering, I can spend 20 minutes or more looking at myself-picking apart flawless.It's been 2 years since I've taken a picture of myself and posted it anywhere because I believe I'm truly revolting to the eye. I cringe whenever someone tries to show me photos of myself and I pretend to look,but I don't. My 19th birthday is in a few days and I feel extremely bad about myself. I've been on this Earth for 18 years and I have nothing to show for it. 5 minutes can't go by without me thinking about how ugly I am.
