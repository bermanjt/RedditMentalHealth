0,"I'm a nurse, but have not worked in nursing for a year. I left an abusive husband, moved out of the state, have been spending the year in therapy after depression and anxiety took over my life. I have come a long way in healing and I am ready to get back to work and start rebuilding my life. However I know I am afraid and worried that I won't be able to handle it. I know that nursing has been overwhelming and has put a lot of stress in my life in the past, but I handled it, until my divorce &amp; the PTSD took over.  Now that I've been through the roughest year of my life - I'm worried that I will not make it - that I will fail. I am still in therapy &amp; everything in my life is better - there is still this fear in the back of my mind. ",28Jul2017,2
2,"Hi all. I wanted to tell someone about a recent adventure I had which will come to conclusion next week.I apologies for the length in advance.

I have moved  down to live with my parents for the summer after university finished last year. I've also found a good summer job which will last me the whole summer and September. I am a receptionist at a hotel. 

Now a couple of weeks ago, a group of about 50 people from abroad checked in. They are staying for a month and are really nice people. However there was this special girl that I had a slightly different connection with. She was beautiful and extremely funny. She came to the reception a few times since and we exchanged casual greetings. The past week I've been placed on night shift and she would come down almost every day at about 1 a.m. to refill her water bottle. I chatted to her and found out a bit about her life, where she was from, what she likes, her hobbies etc. I felt happy talking to her and she seemed to enjoy talking to me too. 

After much deliberation and thought, I decided to ask her to go to a book shop with me (my favourite one in the city - she likes books too). I was  too shy the yesterday and was all ready earlier today. However she only stayed for about 30 secs and was too tired from the day so I missed my opportunity. I decided to do one last thing and leave her a letter which she would collect at reception (we keep post for guests - one of my other colleagues would give it to her). In it I wrote in summary how this was my last night shift and I probably won't see her again; I'm planning a trip to the bookshop and was wondering if she would like to join; leaving my phone number and what social media I use. My colleague messaged me just an hour ago saying that she received the letter.

Now some of you might be thinking I was really stupid/dumb to risk my job over something as petty as this. However I put in a lot of thought to it. I don't have anyone to talk to regarding these matters (I have no such close friends) and all my decisions were in the end, based on my own will. I couldn't find anything within our policy regarding this however I don't know of the consequences should she report me. I am 18 years old and am going through a lot of depression and anxiety for reasons which are complicated. I took a risk knowingly, and have no one to blame.  feel very lonely sometimes and really thought at the time she might say yes. I will update you all if she replies or if I see her again before she leaves next week (or I lose my job). If the very latter does take place I don't think I'll be able to really live. Thank you.",28Jul2017,2

7,"I don't really know what to say. In the past few months, I've heard of so many of my friends trying to commit suicide, or going through with it, that I'm numb. I don't know how I'm supposed to react, other than just feeling this overwhelming sadness that I didn't reach out, or that I didn't send them some random message or something.

When I was 19, I attempted suicide. I overdosed on opiates, when nobody was around to stop me, and my girlfriend happened to call me and kept me on the phone. It was terrifying and peaceful. She didn't know where I was, so there wasn't a way for an ambulance to come get to me, there was no narcan, nothing. I had just lost my mother to breast cancer, and the rest of my family was slowly imploding. I felt completely hopeless and I didn't see another way out. I don't remember hanging up the phone, and I passed out.

A little over two days later, I woke up. Groggy and uncomfortable because while I somehow made it into a room, I only half made it onto the bed. I felt something complicated- that not only was a failure, but I was a failure at suicide. It was a bitter irony, and it hurt. But I couldn't bring myself to try again.

It's been almost eight years since then, and I've battled with depression and I've battled with drugs and I wish I could say that I was always winning. I've been suicidal for as long as I can remember, all the way back to when my mom and dad were fighting before they got a divorce, when my mom was in a psych hospital following HER suicide attempt and she told me that I, her son, would be better off without a mom.

I'm kind of ranting now, but the best thing that ever happened to me was waking up after I tried to die. My life has gone places that I never thought it would and I've met some of the most incredible people, I've achieved some things that I always thought would stay dreams. The point is, we don't know where things are going.
If you're dealing with shit like this, I don't expect you to reach out to me. I'll try to reach out to you. But please don't kill yourself. When you die, all of your dreams die with you, and sometimes the best days are right after the rain is the hardest.

I've heard a lot of people talk about how suicide affects the other people in somebody's life, and I think that's the wrong way to look at it. Suicide affects the person committing suicide. Please don't kill the future that you can still reach.

One of my friends killed himself this morning. I miss him.",28Jul2017,17
10,"Long story short I'm taking a course that will run through the end of the year, and the girl in question is enrolled in it as well. We chat during class breaks, I haven't been flirting or spitting any sort of game whatsoever, 100% professional. The instructor put up a slide and she passes me a note asking if I could take a picture and send it to her, with her number below. 

She has the same phone as me, maybe the camera was broken but I'm pretty sure she's into me. I have a girlfriend and am in a committed relationship. I'm not really used to these situations, how should I handle it?

Edit: I injected my gf into a reply in a text message and she seems to have taken it in stride. ",28Jul2017,3
12," When I was little I was sure that I would grow up pursuing what I most wanted to do in life. Somehow, I thought I knew that in college I would most definitely study creative writing and become a fully fledged author and be happy. 

I would write and it would the happiest moment of my life to put my pen to paper and dream up of worlds where I would escape and be safe forever. 

I feel like somehow I made a sacrifice of the hopeful child I was in the name of money. I gave up the one passion and absolute path in life to grow up and set everything as a figment of imagination, an impossible career, a foolish dream, and instead chased after what my parents' version of my happiness is. So every time I come down from some kind of high after reading a crazy good book, I feel an itch to write  a story but instead I'm rambling on reddit and trying to finish a college apps essay. 

I wish that the world and my actions had led to nurturing my creativity instead of ignoring it and shunning it. Now the only thing I can write are sad persuasive essays because it's been almost 3 years since I've used my brain to do what I loved and I don't see a change anytime soon. In fact, I see my passion for writing becoming nothing more than a small memory in the near future. ",28Jul2017,3

15,"My family (mom, dad, 2 brothers) purchased round-trip tickets from NYC to GYE (Ecuador) through a company called Dynamic Airlines. They were supposed to leave on a return flight from GYE to NYC on Wednesday July 26. They sat there for 5 hours on the tarmac and then they were deplaned!? 


The staff told them they could fly the next day. Fast forward to now, tonight, they were told there will be no flight and to just stay put and wait in the airport. They can't even access their own luggage to change their clothes or anything. This is completely unacceptable and inhumane treatment.

Couple of hours later, i become very disappointed in myself for doing the thing i told myself that i had to quit. It helps me drive away the images stuck in my head. It makes me feel good, but i don't like the feeling that i get, so in a way i don't even like it. I just want to be alone, but i don't want to be alone. I say I'm to busy to hang out, but in reality i'm just back at home, doing the things that keep me at bay. I have tried opening up to my significant other, when i said it, she became sad and i made up lies so that it seems that it is actually isn't a problem.

24,"So this started with a post, I got it approved by a mod because it was being automatically taken down, so they fixed it and BAM it's up and all is well. I come back later to being banned because of it being a ""repost"" that had been getting removed by mods because it broke their rules (according to them) which I wasn't happy about. I specifically included the message I had with another mod who approved the post and asked if it was a mistake since one of them had approved it being posted, but they ignored and didn't care to respond. Still, according to ceddit at the time, every post about the story had been nearly instantly removed and there hadn't been a new post on the subreddit in a LONG time since the story actually happened, almost as if the subreddit had been frozen, not allowing new posts to be made.

So, like any idiot, this upset me and I asked for more information as to why I was banned, since I never got an answer regarding the mod who approved and made sure the post showed up. This is when a moderator messaged me and told me I would have to pay him for that, and that he doubted I could afford it. Now I was REALLY upset, and let that cloud my judgement. So I made the issue public, but no one really cared and it just died away...but my anger didn't. I let it get to me more than I should have, but it just kept eating at me until I decided to appeal my ban. I provided all of the information, including the conversation with the mod who approved and made sure the post appeared...and I was denied. But I wasn't just denied...my appeal was denied because I went public with the issue, and even though I didn't break any rules, they wouldn't unban me because of that. I was no longer upset...I was just frozen by that...and then I was livid. I asked how they thought they could ignore their own rules and ban people who didn't even break them and on and on...and I didn't get a response, just muted. I talked with some people who asked me to get everything and send it to them, but that never went anywhere...then I remembered the new moderator guidelines that were coming, but I doubted they would matter since this happened before them, but what the heck.

The new moderator guidelines became effective, and I once again appealed my ban...just denied, no reason. I asked for a reason and they muted me again. OK, so let's try the Reddit admins, maybe I can at least get a more detailed explanation out of them...HAHAHAHA, no. Just a copy/paste response about mods being allowed to do whatever they want as long as they don't break site wide rules (they didn't add the moderator guidelines to this for 2 months after they were implemented which was funny). I asked if a moderator wanting payment to answer questions about a ban was against the rules, and they said, ""they weren't being serious."" OK, now I'd have been fine with this response if they had taken the time to contact the moderator and see what the deal was there, but their response was in under a minute, and I had included the message from the mod in the message. I don't really think it matters if you assume they are joking or not, you should still look into it, and it was only one of the issues that existed. Oh well, nothing came from that...wait a while...let's appeal the ban again, provide an explanation about what happened and apologize for being upset about the whole situation...no response, just muted from contacting them again.

This happened a few more times, and even though they were in violation of the Moderator Guidelines, that the Reddit admins include as something moderators must follow...they didn't care. So where did this lead? Well...nowhere. It doesn't matter. Even though the subreddit has a massive record of abusing power, the Reddit admins never step in to do anything. Even with everything put forth, they don't consider their actions to be against the guidelines, even when the moderators admit to banning me without me breaking any rules and just because I tried to expose an abusing mod...Yes, admitting that a mod is abusive and getting upset that I tried to expose them, and Reddit admins still don't care.

I enjoyed being a part of reddit communities and having discussions with people over all sorts of stuff...but this ruined it for me, and I got caught up in being so angry over it, it just ruined Reddit as a whole for me. It won't get better until they admit there is a problem and actually try to fix it instead of just using a scapegoat. They seem to think it will fix itself...it won't, it will just get worse, as the last year of it has shown.",28Jul2017,0

33,"I work at a non-profit organization, we have a lot of volunteers. Earlier this week, I was having an anxiety attack in the break room (work stuff combined with my friend being a jerk) and a volunteer walks in while I am drying my tears. I am on the tail end of my attack, almost ready to go back to work and he asks if I'm okay. I'm not faulting him for asking, but it's very hard for me talk at this point what with constricted airways and the like. I give him a vague answer, because that's all I can muster (and also all I want him to know). He does the typical awkward consolation, which is to be expected, but really I was fine by myself. So I go back to work, (restocking food for foster kittens) and he follows me and asks what I'm doing. I tell him. He continues standing there knowing full well that I am busy and not capable of having a conversation right now. He grabs a broom like he's about to go off and do his own thing, except he doesn't. He stays there. And I'm feeling really awkward but I only have 10 minutes until I clock out so I put up with it. He follows me to sign out, (which I do at the computer because I'm getting paid for my work unlike him) and goes the same time I do. I get the jump on him and get outside before he does, and get in my car. 

I don't mean to sound rude or ungrateful, but my anxiety was already on high and he shot himself in the foot by assuming that someone broke up with me, as if I was immediately going to turn into the nearest boy's arms and cry about it. No thanks. 

Also as I was writing, he came in and said hi. No other purpose to come in here except to say hi. Not even throwing trash away, just looking for me. I am uncomfortable to say the least.",28Jul2017,3

Finals for this semester are now in 3 days. A few days ago I started questioning my sexuality and realized I might be gay or bi (I've definitely been after girls and in love with at least 1 but who knows. Not a rare thing among gay people). I'm okay with that, but somehow the thought just makes me anxious. I just want to get rid of all thoughts involving my sexuality entirely, for now. It's pointless stress I do not want to experience. 


Since yesterday it dawned on me more and I could not shake the thought, even though I wanted to. Since then I feel ""off"" somehow, it might be the stress, it might be me getting sick. 



I've taking caffeine pills on the daily for the last 3 weeks, but I never exceeded 150mg a day, taking no more than 100mg on most days. I made sure to get 8 hours of sleep and regular meals to make up for it.



Yesterday my thoughts and my neighbours music kept me up super long, but for an hour in the evening before going to bed I started feeling weird. My stomach felt really ""acidic"" and I almost threw up.


When I woke up today after 6 hrs of sleep, I felt ""off"", still. Like I was hung over. I was more tired than I should be, could not focus on anything and no matter which position I was sitting in, it was uncomfortable.

I had to force myself to eat lunch and felt a bit sick in the stomach. 
When I got home I just tried to relax and played videogamea for 3 or 4 hours. Tried eating diner in between, barely got anything down my throat. 


When I was done playing and decided to sleep, I felt the same ""acidity"" and sickness again, all thoughts that I wanted to go away came back and I threw up. Spit out a bit of blood in my spit afterwards, must have come from my throat. 


I've had a history of getting sick at parties or similar, but had kept my HA from eating me up by telling me it must be PC or similar. Now it's been going for 2 yrs (The stomach thing) and I feel like this might be it worsening and my HA fucks with my head again.



This is way too much for me to handle at once, I can't keep up with this shit. Any reaction by anyone on how I can deal with all of this would be helpful. Exams never consciously stressed me this much, but maybe it's creeping on me. I feel aweful.",28Jul2017,1

38,"I made a post a couple of days ago about me ""gaining weight"" (only one kilogram so nothing much), and how my body dysmorphia was getting worse along with that. This is part two of my Venting diary...

So today was a little worse. I thought I started of the day in a good way, with a healthy breakfast and not eating too much. Though this good mood was somewhere along the way lost, when I believe I ate too much for dinner. Now I can't stop looking down on myself. 

I have little self control, and I am afraid that I will gain further weight because of it. When I feel good I get the bad Idea to eat something sweet, I am young and should live my life after all.  Though afterwords eating the empty calories, I fall in to this spiral of looking down on myself (mentioned above). I don't know how to fix that stupid part of myself. I have considered to just look myself in and skip a few meals, maybe I will do that tomorrow.     

Also I start to feel this longing/considering of sadness. Whenever I am sad, I sometimes don't feel like eating. And then I therefor wouldn't gain weight, right? I don't know, it can be kind of nice to just coup in loneliness sometimes. 

I know my brain is fucked up, like seriously bad. Though I don't have the energy to fix it right now, so venting kind of helps instead. Please give me some feedback if you felt this post was out of place. I know there are some other sub-reddits dedicated to BDD, but I figured my post would fit here on r/self anyway.
