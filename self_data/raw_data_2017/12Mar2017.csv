1,"(Removed from TIFU so posting here) 

Yesterday at school, we were doing presentations on a up and coming tech product that interests us. (High School Computers class) I decided to do mine on the amazon drone, and I was putting the finishing touches on my powerpoint before I presented, which included a video displaying the product. As I was putting the URL into a slide, I got a text from my friend (imessage on macbook) asking about a refrence from a popular song which he didn't get because he hadn't heard it yet. So I copied the link to the song and texted it to him. Then, I went to copy the link to the    drone and pasted it into the presentation. After that, my teacher called my name for me to present.

I went up in front of the whole class and started presenting, it actually went really well. I didn't slur any of my words, and the teacher actually looked rather pleased. I got to the last slide, and clicked on the link. What I didn't realize is that I pasted the rap song in instead. Now if I had just pasted into the link the song itself, I could've just closed the tab while it was just the song beginning with a beat and no words and searched up my other video.

BUT, when I sent it to my friend, youtube opened up to where I had previously been listening to the song. I guess I accidentally clicked the ""start at ____"" box. So when I sent the link to him, it started at a certain line at the song. That also means that when I clicked the link infront of the class, it started at the time where he was already rapping. The video started really quick, because the computer room is right by the router. So while I scrambled to close the tab, the lyrics *""I put a hole in your parents""* played out full blast, because I had the sound turned all the way up so the whole class could hear the video. It dosen't help that the photo displayed throught the whole video is a kid with a blunt in his nose. I immediately scrambled for the cursor and couldn't find it, but closed the tab relatively quick before any other lines would play. I was apologizing profusely, but my old school teacher immediately started yelling at me, and ordered me to go to the office. I tried to explain myself, but he told me to go right then and there.

I walked to the principals office and sat there for a while, awaiting my punishment. The principal at my school is a reasonable guy, so I assumed that things would go fine. The problem is, the principal took a few days off to leave for summer break. So the acting principal was the vice-principal. Who has a reputation for not hearing anyone out.

I sit in the vice principals office, and in comes the Vice principal, my computers teacher, and a crying girl in my class. This girl is relatively sheltered. Her family is very religious, and she dosen't even cuss. She dresses very respectfully, and once told me that I was a sinner for wearing a [retro polaroid](http://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/50806534?wid=450&amp;hei=450&amp;fmt=pjpeg) shirt because it has a rainbow on it. The teacher and the girl are both highly offended and talked about the video and how disgusted they were with the content of the song. The girl said she felt personally threated and thought I would literally shoot her parents. I tried to explain that I was just trying to send the video to a friend earlier, and accidentally pasted the wrong link into my presentation. The teacher didn't buy it and thought I was lying, he thinks im a ""drug addict hooligan"" (I'm not) because on the first day I carried my skateboard into class on the first day because I didn't have a locker yet, and he thinks I'm a stoner because one day I came into class teary/red eyed because I had just heard bad news about a friend. The VP was just as mad, made me apologize to the girl and the teacher. And she gave me a week of in-school suspension as soon as I come back to school from spring break, and put me on some sort of watch program for students that they are afraid of acting out. This means that I cannot take my skateboard into school because they are afraid of me using it as a weapon, and I can't bring my phone into class for a whole month. 

(Song for context: https://youtu.be/Wmjpp0_6kb0?t=1m1s)

TL;DR; Accidentally pasted wrong link into powerpoint, song pasted had threating words. Got sent to office and recieved week of inschool suspension, put on watch list for troubled teens.",12Mar2017,22
2,"I'm 34 and am accompanying my father on a trip to rural Illinois to see my 103 year old grandma who although in declining health is still very much ""there"" mentally. It is a painfully awkward situation for me and probably her because I am a bad conversationalist (sometimes wonder if I have undiagnosed Assburgers) in the first place and on top of that just have nothing to talk to her about. To complicate things, my brother, whom I loathe, is here with us and I have to pretend not to be repulsed by his presence. Last time we visited, which was in the summer of 2011, I pretty much just sat there and played on my phone while my parents chatted with my grandma the whole time, and we are currently experiencing a repeat of that painful episode.She is 100 and freaking 3 for chrissakes. She sends me a birthday and Chirstmas card every year and it's so sweet...I just don't have anything to say to her. Due to bad circumstances I have pretty much no life at all by normal standardsâ€”nothing to share, nothing tell her say about what's going on in my life. So what should I do. Make something up? Show her cat memes? Help.",12Mar2017,5

6,"It's 3 am here and I just can't sleep. Just gonna spill my mind here. In  the past few days my head is just too full of thoughts. 

About my dad - it bothers me I never cried about hia death even though it was the most tragic thing that happened to me. Thinking about how it drastically changed my life. Everything I am now and everything I do stems from that moment. 
But I'm also thinking about her. That one girl I met in math course. We had a casual chat, which eventually led to me telling her the story of how my father was killed. 
I told that story a thousand times, it became so mundane to me. Along the years, all the reactions of people to this atory were the same - ""I'm sorry"", and maybe a nod. 

But she started crying. 

She started crying and I didn't know what to do with myself. 

Later that day, and for the rest of the following week, I couldn't stop thinking about her crying. 

Her tears made a crack somewhere in my soul. And I feel like there is something there that's waiting for years to come out. 

I owe her my eternal gratitude for being such a monumental part of my journey to my father, eveb though she doesn't know that.",12Mar2017,1
7,"This is a cross post from /r/sex

I'm going to ""nerdy sex-positive, kink/LGBT/poly-friendly etc."" house party on St Patrick's and there's going to be ample supplies of alcohol, nudity, and public sex. I don't really consider myself to be a virgin per se, I've been intimate with several different partners but due to being the typical sheltered homeschooled kid I had nonexistent sex ed growing up and was always too scared to do anything penetrative out of fear of getting someone pregnant or getting an STD. Lots and lots of oral and digital sex but nothing beyond that.

I've been single and with extremely few sexual encounters since I was teenager and am finally educating myself and putting myself back out there. I already know and get along very well with just about everyone that's going to be there, seen most of them naked, and even played around a little bit with the couple hosting it, and there's a very good chance I'm going to be finding a corner to lay down a towel and hook up with someone (or someones) that night. I've never bought condoms or lube and generally have no idea what the hell I'm doing but I'm actively pushing myself to learn and explore. I know the hosts will be supplying some of the sexy supplies but I figure it's smart to bring some of my own too and (any advice in that arena would be helpful).

Most everyone there is much more sexually experienced than I am, (ages 22-35ish) with both vanilla sex and beyond so I'm feeling way out of my league, but they've been very understanding and acknowledge that ""everyone starts somewhere.""

Anyone else ever been through something like this before? I'm very optimistic even though I'm flying blind.",12Mar2017,1

9,"So a very long story short, I found out my wife has been very bleak with me about her political beliefs. When I met her we were both (I thought) on the same side. I actively campaign for democrats. In fact I push for a communist America. She wasn't quite that far, but enough to help me push for Stalinist policies in my city. A few months ago after she went out with some friends she walked in laughing about something. All I heard was ""Trump.... haha... doing it"". I didn't think anything of it. We voted this year, me for the Green Party and her writing in Bernie. Until yesterday. I found her phone while she was in the shower and found she had created a second reddit account and was active on t_d. Do I confront her? What do I say to her? ",12Mar2017,1

I don't know whether my friendships were one-sided, or whether people have gotten all too busy to deal with me. A small slice of me is paranoid that my ex has been spreading rumors (she actually did a few years ago and over 10-15 friends instantly unfriended or blocked me that week, I don't know what the rumors are.)

17,"Recently, I moved to the middle of nowhere from an urban area. I moved in with family, because the person I was staying with kicked me out. I could have moved in with my mother, but my stepdad is a character, to say the least, so I moved in with my aunt. Her only rule was ""no smoking pot."" Alright, I can live without for a while. 

Slowly, all of the household duties were put on my shoulders. Okay, I'm earning my keep. Cooking meals, cleaning, etc. 

Cut to about two weeks ago. My grandmother, who lives nearby, came to the house in one of her ""moods."" Forced my very sick cousin to clean the house, and bitched about how we never do anything around the house and so on. So I told her off. Called my aunt and told her about the situation. She proceeded to berate the both of us for the same reasons, despite my diligence regarding the house, and casually mentioned ""no more alcohol."" Because apparently I have reverted back to my alcoholic ways, which, frankly, is not true. I have a drink or two after work to unwind, but very rarely do I drink to drunkenness, let alone everyday. 

Cut to yesterday. My cousin, not the ill one, who just turned 21, came back from college for spring break, so we picked up some alcohol. Its easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, right? She obviously wasn't pleased, but neither of us cared, given her well known hypocritical nature. We had a few drinks and turned in for the night. Nothing crazy. 

Today, on the way back from town, she started up a conversation about the minimum wage. She is very blatantly conservative, whereas we are both anarchists. We let her speak on her soapbox and countered with several facts. She proceeded to lose her shit, scream at us for being disrespectful (despite her disrespecting every food service/retail employee by claiming they're all Mexicans and drug addicts), cranking the radio to cut me off, and drive 90 down a 55 mph curvy road. We get home and begin unloading, and she proceeds to take my liquor and pour herself a shot. Okay? Then another. And another. And another. And another. 

Literally two minutes later, she begins slurring her words and acting drunk. I've been a bartender for years. Alcohol does not work that quickly unless you give yourself a vodka enema. 

She tells her 14 year old son about her sex life, or lack thereof, and how his father refused to sleep with her after she lost weight because 'he only likes fat girls.' She begins to curse and say my cousin (21) and I hate her and we are useless. 

As I'm in the basement searching for my fry daddy, she comes, or should I say tumbles, down the stairs, breaks a stair, and claims to pee herself. 

She proceeds to call my mother and begins telling her how I'm disrespectful, do nothing around the house, so on. In short, lying. 

I want to move out. As much as I can't stand my stepdad, I'd far rather be living with him than this bullshit. This childlike drunkenness, the blatant disrespect, the bullshit. Maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe I'm not. I don't fucking know. I'm just so pissed. ",12Mar2017,1
21,"So you know when you put a desktop computer to sleep, it flashes the power LED to let you know it's asleep and not off, yeah? On older versions of windows, I felt like it was taking slow, deep breaths when it was sleeping. Two seconds or so off, a second on, repeat. Nice and slow, just like it's actually sleeping. 

Now it's half a second on and off and repeating, and it seems like it's hyperventilating or struggling to breathe or something. Not like it's sleeping at all. ",12Mar2017,1
24," 30 years old. I feel I gotta meet this perfect image for woman, so that gives some insight of my lack of experience.
 I see friends who are so nonchalant about everything. They have no issues landing relationships and no issues about losing them. I got friends who do scummy shit to their woman, and they're still ""the woman's man"".

 Im trapped between being the worst person I could be and trying to be someone decent. 
In the end, I feel like death is the only thing I can feel good about. Because it is the only release from this overly complicated game.

Unless Im missing something.

I either try too hard to be funny or afraid to try at all. I go home look in the mirror and call myself a POS and I'm bot good enough.

Thats most likely why I drink alot. Just to feel numb about it.",12Mar2017,2
26,"The other day I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/5xzndw/am_i_moving_on_too_soon/). I said at the end of the post that the girl from work, I'll call her Rachel, asked if I wanted to go to Chipotle with her this weekend. Well, I ended up accepting. Tonight we went and it was the most fun I've had in a long time. I very rarely get out of the house other than work, so it was so nice to actually do something. Even more so that it was with her.

But now I'm more confused than ever. I'm pretty sure that she might like me, and now even our coworkers are saying that they are sure she does. I know it's usually not a good idea to date coworkers, but I'm trying to look at this as we're not always going to be coworkers. I don't want to stop something from happening just because we happen to work at the same place at the moment.

There's one moment in particular that I have been thinking about all night. I was filming us while we were in her car, and a certain song came on the radio and I said, ""[Rachel], if the whole world was watching I would still dance with you"". She looked directly into the camera and said, ""I really appreciate that. More than you know"". My friends and a couple coworkers saw it after I uploaded it to YouTube, and they said that that moment when she looked at the camera, that was the moment they changed their minds and said that we should be together. The look on her face, the expression.

But I'm still conflicted. Largely from habit. I'm not exactly ""traditionally attractive"", meaning that I look like Nosferatu. Meanwhile, she's perhaps the most gorgeous person I've ever seen in my life. That's not just me saying that because I like her, everyone tells her how gorgeous she is all the time, to the point where telling her that means almost nothing to her. She knows that she is beautiful...but she's not arrogant or vain about it. She just acknowledges it and it's just a fun fact to her. Going against stereotypical clichÃ©s, she's also extremely intelligent. She and I have deep conversations about a wide range of topics. While we don't agree on everything, we can discuss them without arguing. If you read my original post, you'd know that this is a huge deal to me. My last girlfriend recently broke up with me because we disagreed on one thing.

I really wish I could share here the photos I've been taking of us lately, because our friends and coworkers keep saying that we're cute together. I made a picture we took together tonight my profile picture, and now everyone is talking about us potentially dating.

Everyone except us. I'd rather her bring it up first. She also went through a horrible break up around the time I did, so we both have healing to do. And to be honest, I'd rather have her as a bestfriend than not at all. We were walking around Walmart and she led us to the makeup aisle. I have five sisters, so I was able to have a conversation with her about this looking better on her than that. She even joked about doing me up in makeup, which I'd totally do because it'd just be fun to spend time with her.

If this is just rebound feelings, I hope it passes quickly, because I'd hate to ruin what we have by assuming things. She's very important to me, and I think the world of her.",12Mar2017,1

I have a well paying job working at home and for the past several years - ever since I finished the school/college stage of my life, where you're forced to interact with people - I haven't had a lot of exposure to being part of a group of people and/or having a healthy social life. Recently I started going to these meetings held by an organization that promotes getting out of your shell and being a good person and spreading positivity and whatnot. These are all great people, open minded and friendly and I feel good around them, but I feel like I'm so out of touch and it's very difficult for me to fit in because of my sheltered past. And I've started noticing when I'm around them (or any other groups of people, but mostly them since I spend more time there), I've got this strange nervous twitch in my eyes, like a forced blink. I can tell as I'm doing it that it's a defense mechanism of some kind, it's probably my brain trying to comfort me while I'm anxious, and I'm trying to control it, but my fear is that it will develop into something even more noticeable.

I gave her space, stopped texting and flirting with her for a couple days and now she's all jolly and sweet again. Now should I get back at flirting and maybe ask her out?

Some stuff about me: 
I enjoy programming and I just use this account to post stuff once in a while, I have friends in my main account that I don't want to see me post this. I've been vegetarian for 2 and a half years now. I wear special contacts. I come from a Hispanic background. 


There are so many problems with me. To start off I'm 17 years old. I was born on September 11, 1999. I grew up with somewhat wealthy parents that got nice jobs when they initially came to the US and had gotten enough pay to buy a nice two story house in a nice neighborhood. When I was barely going to graduate middle school they both lost their jobs within a month of each other and I had to move to another city and didn't even go to my ceremony. 

Flash forward a year, I'm obese and just got diagnosed with Keratoconus on both eyes. So, I'm fat and going blind. That was pretty much the only bad things that happened until a year later in my sophomore year. I was told by multiple people about my super thin hair and it made me self conscious. I looked into it, and I found out I was already losing my hair, at 15 years old... I had to get some hair treatment from Walmart and have been using it ever since because  I didn't want to be made fun of at my school for being bald so early. 

Flash forward another year later, I lost 70 pounds. I'm now taking AP classes and I am doing okay in school. I made a few friends and my hair is looking alright. The only downside to my life right now is that I have some uneven fat distribution that I don't know how to fix. My parents also get mad at me for doing too much homework, it makes me feel like I shouldn't be doing this much work, it makes me unmotivated. A couple months later around the end of the school year, I get a girlfriend :) and I am really happy with her.

Again, the next school year starts -- I'm a senior now. I'm taking some AP classes again and things are going good. Well, not so much. I live in a crowded home and my parents are in so much debt now. I don't have my own room, I sleep in the living area now. College applications are here and I applied to 8 because my school was paying for them. I feel a tiny bit confident, but not so much because  I have a 3.6 GPA. I'm hoping I get into a good one. 


Here I am now, currently writing this. It's been a few months and universities are sending their acceptance and rejection letters. Out of all of the ones I've applied to, I've only been accepted to one, CSUF, I haven't heard from 3, and I got rejected from 4. My girlfriend has been accepted to every place  she has applied to so far. I feel jealous yet happy for her. I feel sad that I am not good enough for the universities. I feel sad that we are going to be separated during that time, and I've read that many relationships don't even last in college. I feel sad and jealous that my life isn't as good as hers. She gets to go shopping a lot for clothes, I've had the same clothes since my freshman year. Even though I love her and even though I'm happy that her life is going well, I still feel sad that mine isn't like that. At least  I work now, and I can raise up money for clothes I need and books and other things. I panic every once in a while. When I think about the future. I looked on the CSUF subreddit. They don't have a very good engineering department, mostly because it doesn't have enough faculty or something like that, I'm not very sure. People are saying that it's very difficult to get the right classes and that it takes an average of 5 years to graduate from there. I'm doing Computer Science. I panic because I worry about me and my girlfriend in college. She applied as a  graphic design major and got accepted to CSULB. I think I'm just very insecure at this point because I worry about us too much and I cant help it. I wish  I was pushed to succeed by my parents and by my previous teachers. I wish I had known sooner, so that I wouldn't be worrying about any of this stuff right now. Anyway, those are my problems. My hair is falling out again. So I'm going bald, blind, I'm in poverty and I feel inadequate. 


I'm sure many people have it worse. I just needed somewhere to vent for  a while. Hey, maybe I can find others going through the same struggles.  I hope I don't sound pathetic to anyone who bothers to read this.

47,"I've never been that good with conversations. I usually get asked a bunch of simple questions before the conversation turns to awkward silence. And the more I think about it, the more I realize that it's a natural result of technology.

Imagine that you met someone with all the knowledge known to humanity. The conversations, of course, would be amazing, as this person would provide the best jokes, opinions, etc. You can spend hours talking to this person and never get bored, so why would you talk to anyone else?

That person is effectively the internet. One can look up an article on any subject, play almost any game, and watch an endless stream of entertaining YouTube videos and Netflix content. The problem comes when one must choose between the internet and social interaction, which causes an incredible amount of isolation.

I believe that most people do not think that it would be in anyone's best interest to start a conversation. If one says a joke, the listener secretly prefers to view a better one on their phone. The speaker, meanwhile, knows this and feels unable to provide value to the other person. Social interaction then becomes an exercise in politeness where everyone pretends to enjoy the company of each other.

Most likely, I'm just imagining this problem. But if I'm not, there are very few solutions. We could improve the learning curve and accessibility of content creation tools so that people can feel needed. We could also create AI's that mimic the feeling of inclusion. But the fact that this varies so far from the natural communication process shows a bleak future for the psychological health of humanity.",12Mar2017,4
