0,"I was in the 3rd grade and there was this really nerdy, weird, and shy child who was also and anime weeaboo who was an asshole too. Usually, kids like that keep to themselves, but he tried to act cool all the time and be a bully to others to make himself look superior.

Well, one day, I was in class and we were going on a field trip to a carnival, the big ""nerdy weeaboo kid"" (yes that's what we called him) was being his regular douchebag self. Once we were about to leave, I saw the kid bring out some of his Yu-Gi-Oh cards. 

He thought he was a king over them, he was bragging to my friends and shoving them in their faces. And they weren't even good, they were shitty cards that don't even have over 1000 attack points. My friend almost punched the kid too.

Well, it became time to go on the field trip. We boarded the bus, and our school gave us assigned seats because of all the conflict that goes on when we can pick where we sit. I had to sit by the weeaboo kid, and my friends were on the seat behind us.

The kid ended up bringing out his cards, he shoved them in our faces and bragged. I told him off and said his cards weren't even good, any beginner at the game would annihilate him at it. He ended up saying ""Fuck off, I'm better."" Like the little cunt he was.

Well, once we got off, we were allowed to go to the bathroom, once I and the weeaboo were next, we went into the stalls. After we came out to wash our hands, he once more took his Yu-Gi-Oh cards and shoved them in my face.

I ended up going ballistic on him, I scolded him repeatedly, and took his cards, went back to the stall, threw them individually into the toilet, and flushed it. Some stayed, but most went down (which I wasn't expecting) and he ran in and punched me, it wasn't even that hard and went he ballistic too.

The teachers heard it all and came in. We got referrals and was sent home. In my book the lil' bitch deserved it, so the punishment was sort of worth it. Anyways, my friends thought I was pretty fucking badass for teaching him a lesson, and we didn't see him for the rest of the week. We heard he was crying and was moving away.

1,"It feels so good. All the anxiety and tension I've been having everyday for years just melts away in those 10 minutes. I know it'll fuck me up later and I'll get addicted, but if other people can successfully quit, then I figure I can get past this current bullshit in my life and leave the quitting to the more stable future me.",27Apr2017,1
3,"From the outside looking in, I have a pretty good life. Young, college educated, really well paying job, close knit family, supportive girlfriend, I'm physically active, grew up middle class with little to no drama, mildly above average looking? 

But for many years, I've just found life very tiresome and besides temporary happiness such as buying things, vacations, etc I can't remember the last time I was just generally happy. I find I'm always setting goals for myself to achieve more and more, but when I reach those goals I either want more or just am nonchalant about the results. 

I don't think I'm depressed because I look at posts on some sadder subreddits and realize how bad some people truly have it. I think I'm just sad. Is there any self help books or videos you guys can recommend? Could a psychologist help with this sort of stuff?

6,"I've been on reddit for about a year and a half. I joined not long after the whole Ellen Pao and fatpeoplehate debacle. I've seen the good and the bad in this site. But I liked it, that's why I stayed.

Reddit seems to be changing. It's becoming more commercial. The top post on /r/funny at the moment? Basically an IKEA ad. There is another ad at the top of the page, in one of the classic ""you will be shocked"" kind of style. Another ad at the bottom to get me to join /r/hearthstone and start playing it I guess. I don't know why subreddits are advertised to me, I have no interest in getting hearthstone tbh. I feel bombarded with ads. Since the majority of redditors run ad blockers, the ads are more insidous and blend in.

Plus the new profile system. If I wanted to follow someone I'd use Twitter.

If the site continues like this I might have to look for something else.

I know there are always a lot of this kind of post. But this is my two cents.",27Apr2017,1

8,"I'll list the pros and cons for going the credential route as best as I can. 

Pros:
1. Teaching is what my major is geared toward. 
2. I like working with kids. 
3. Teaching public school includes benefits, summers off, pension and eventually tenure. 

Cons: 
1. I am SICK of being a student. 
2. I'd probably need to relocate, which might mean losing all my gigs and private students (I'm a musician). 
3. Teaching music would involve constant fundraising, haggling with the PTA, dealing with administrative work, organizing tours and competitions, long hours, some weekends, and having parents yell at you. 
4. The credential program would cost money and prevent me from making much for another 1-2 years. 

I guess to summarize I'm itching to just work and feeling a little teaching anxiety. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.   ",27Apr2017,1
9,"My anger issues are so much worse now. I literally yell at my phone ""SHUT UP!"" whenever my mom texts me anything, and I say the same under my breath when she tries to make casual conversation with me. I don't know why I do that. And I also get easily angry with other people, too. Sometimes it feels like everyone has such a loud and shrill voice, and even a whisper from across the room registers as if it was right next to my ear.

And I get way angrier from mundane things. Like if a video game confuses me or if I lose at it, I start to hit myself, swing at the air,  silently scream, etcetera. I even bit my leg just recently. This also is starting to happen when I lose an argument. In general, every little thing seems to make me furious and I stay furious for longer than I should.

And then there are times where I feel absolutely down in the dumps. Like, it feels like I'm descending into some dark vortex, pardon the dumb terminology. Like my despair feels like it's getting worse and worse with no way out. I criticize myself. How am I gonna find a job? How will I ever move out? I'm too dumb for all of that. I'm a disappointment, through and through.

My mom doesn't know that I'm hitting myself again, but I'm sure she's noticed how I'm more distant with her. She loves me and has done nothing but good to me, yet I still seem to get irritated by her all the time. Why am I like that?

And I think I might be getting somewhat paranoid on occasion. Like there was one time at school recently where I got really distressed from all the background noise that I for a couple hours thought that my friends were intentionally causing me distress because they ""like seeing me like this."" I believe I snapped out of that pretty quickly, though. 

I'm seeing a therapist on Monday. Hopefully he'll know what is going on. Maybe I'm developing some new disorder in addition to my asperger's, who knows. I'm at that young adult age range where that sort of stuff starts to happen. Or maybe I'm just being a whiney, melodramatic child again.

One thing's for certain: I cannot handle stress to save my life.",27Apr2017,1

12,"My sister is two years younger than me (we are both young adults and live with our father) and has bullied me all my life. 

Today we were home and she was trying to get into my personal space even though I was telling her to back away from me. I tried to get myself away from her but she backed me into a corner, so as she continued to advance towards me despite my protests I reached into my pocket and pulled out my knife.

Immediately her face lit up as she realized she could get me into serious trouble with our dad. So she yelled across the house that I had pulled a knife on her for no reason.

He believed her and won't hear a word of what I have to say. She very regularly abuses me mentally and sometimes physically, and even though I have threatened her in an attempt to stop her a few times I have never harmed her. She has stabbed me twice...

21,"(posted from a throwaway account so i'm not stalked)

so... i guess i just need to get some things off my chest because it seems like no one else will really listen to me. lots of this will probably just be my life story, interesting or not. sorry if this is long. it will probably be very long. ;;

i doubt anyone will read this and thats fine. personally, i'm just glad i wrote it. i put a tldr at the bottom too.

i'm an absolute shut-in. i tell very few people anything about my true ""self"", who they think is just some sweet innocent odd-looking girl, when in reality, being called innocent is an insult to everything i've been through. that being said, being this way is pretty much the only way i've managed to stay sane through all the years... because trying to tell someone things about my life can often feel kind of like trying to explain string theory to a goldfish. it's not an insult to anyone's intelligence when i say that, i just mean the experiences are extremely different, and they have a hard time relating or even beginning to comprehend.

my childhood was mostly spent around (and sometimes in) garbage cans, as i didn't want to talk to anyone and just got headaches trying to ""fit in"" with the other kids... i know i sound really edgy here, but that's how my childhood was, and as a result, i did a lot of solitary thinking. everyone thought i was weird and dumb, and i completely understand why. i don't have an ego because of this and i don't think i'm better than anyone at all, in fact, it's quite the opposite. i have quite a few friends now that i think are great people even if they still don't fully understand everything, and i don't blame them or anyone else. it's all about the environment and genetic makeup in the end.

i usually try to be as nice as i can be. i like to be nice, and it's not to get attention, but it strokes the thought that i am maybe slightly more than just a below average person who can't live up to anything. another thing... i'm very unattractive in a way i can't describe and only people who have seen me seem to understand. and in a world like this, i try to pretend it doesn't get to me, but... i won't pretend here. i'm ugly and it eats me alive even more because i know that i want to be pretty. and i hate that i want to be. it's a cycle. it's not just about the ""media"" setting ""unrealistic standards"", but really, it's about everyone, even reddit. there's subreddits devoted to things like ""cute asian girls doing cute things"", and when i look at things like that, i just can't stop myself from thinking that i wish i could be on a post there or look that good, people thinking things like that about me. i know it's stupid, but at this point i think it's even dumber to deny it. for the longest time i refused to even believe i thought this way, thinking it was too shallow... but it's only gotten worse. these kinds of things are part of why i'm hateful, pitiful, yet oddly intrigued by the internet and websites like this. why am i insulting reddit ON reddit? i don't know. there's a funny sense of irony to it.

it's a lot like youtube comment sections. people often comment dumb and weird things yet get a lot of votes from people who either think it's funny or would've commented the same thing if they had the guts or finesse. i'm ragging on this kind of format, but... at the same time, i can't seem to stop lurking in subreddits or youtube comment sections, really just out of morbid curiosity as to the extent these things i claim really go. often times when i call someone out on being disgusting, i'm given replies that either tell me to shut the fuck up or start attacking me personally, which, frankly, are completely what i expect and all they really do is perpetuate my dislike for these kinds of places. it's never direct insults that really affect me, it's just the state and behaviour of people as a whole and how they think of people like me. sometimes there are people agreeing and that's nice, but the ratio is still rather hopeless. i don't mean to sound vindictive here, this is simply what i've observed/experienced and how it has affected me over my life.

the same goes for things like online games and online relationships. those are the things i've gravitated to as i can create a persona for myself where people don't immediately take things like my looks into their judgement, but now i'm even starting to wonder if these places are even worse than being judged immensely in a more normal environment. i'd get pretty bombarded in online games if i ever tried to use voice (which i understand is a pretty common concern amongst females), and sometimes it's funny and all, but that doesn't change the fact that i feel like i can't just be respected as an individual anywhere, from appearance judgement in real life, vocal judgement in voice chats online, and strange undertones in text chats and comment sections like reddit/youtube.

i've been in a few online ""relationships"", often ending up a waste of time and emotions, and most of them weren't really started by my own accord. i knew very well that i couldn't love anyone without loving myself first, but that didn't stop me from trying my best to help guys with their mental situation who were clearly just trying to take things further with me when i couldn't in the slightest. but i don't really resent any guy for this... and it started to make me realize that there are so many guys that are unbelievably desperate for a ""gf"", whether it be biological urges or whatever else. with that in mind i kind of started to pity them, and that's why i kept in touch, to make sure they were OK... and i knew that if i got into a relationship with that mindset, i would only start feeling bad for millions of other guys. it's pretty much impossible for me to make more than one person happy in that kind of situation, and that did kind of frustrate me, but i've accepted it. anyway, i also realized places like youtube and reddit are filled with guys like that, and that's part of the reason such strange things often get so many upvotes. i think this is sort of an issue with society as a whole right now.

since i'm almost done high school, i'm going through all the horrible experiences of picking colleges/unis for things i'm somewhat interested in, and trying to awkwardly set aside my dreams of doing art, music and design for my own creative pieces for something practical my parents will be OK with. another thing i should mention is that i've never been great at school... i've been constantly too stressed out and zoned out in my own mind and imagination with things like this that i fall behind in school. i can listen and retain very well when i want to, but the most difficult thing is really *wanting* to. 

i guess from an outside perspective, i probably seem like a huge failure in every way... but i think i've helped a lot of people, and i don't intend to stop. i've come into contact with multiple suicidal people, paying close attention to the way they act, and logically trying my hardest to keep them from doing that permanent solution when there's other ways. a lot of the time it has devolved into guys trying to start relationships with me as i mentioned earlier, but i still don't regret doing it, and i've made some great friends along the way, who may have even taken their life otherwise.

even without the things i've done, though, i still appreciate life greatly. i'm grateful to breathe, grateful to calmly listen to the breeze of the wind and my favourite music, to be able to understand and appreciate, and the list goes on. most of the time i've noticed that people are only grateful for that if it's most of all they have, like how homeless people can be content and thankful for simply being alive but a rich person can't live without reputation. i'm not homeless though, my family is pretty ""well-off"", so i guess i'm just in a similar mental state. also i am a weirdo who meditates and it helps me look at things objectively and think freely

almost all of my self worth has come from within, and i really need to start following my own advice that i give others. it's definitely way harder to not be a hypocrite, i can say that much. but i find it incredibly difficult when i'm at complete crossroads socially, where people online, my family, people around me, and even my friends don't treat me in the way i'd like them to at least a bit (which, most of the time, is simply treating me as an equal). it seems like i can't be respected unless i lie about myself, and i've grown tired of lying. of course i have ideals like wanting to be gorgeous and desirable, and i'll still go to sleep feeling unsatisfied until i can get over that, but my main question is, ""is wanting to be respected for who you are really too much to ask for, even if you're a weird ugly girl with strange views of the world?"" maybe it is. you could say i might just be hanging around the wrong people, but really, like i said earlier, i think this has become a problem with society as a whole for me. my friends do love me and think i'm very fun to be around, but i ultimately can't seem to agree with them because of all these things weighing me down mentally. maybe i have internalized self-hate because of my lonely childhood and whatnot. i can't really say.

i think that's it. that's not even close to everything, but it's all i wanna say right now. if you read this through, thank you and i'm sorry. it's embarrassing to admit stuff like this but it feels nice. i hope it entertained you for a while and i hope i didn't come off as rude here, but then i also feel like i shouldn't have to worry about feeling rude so much, and that people are setting expectations and *yada yada* ANYWAY thank you :&gt; 
feel free to ask me/say anything (or tell me to fuck off) if you like!! and i don't mean that passive aggressively if you wanna do that go ahead OK i'm done now i've got an essay to finish

tl;dr uhh... i'm weird and ugly and bad at school, i don't just compare myself to people prettier than me but both online and offline society treats me in a way where i can't feel equal to anyone but helping others has helped me find self worth and i'm grateful for the life i have but society still has these massive roadblocks for me which i can't seem to overcome easily",27Apr2017,6
22,"I'm finally out of retail! In four weeks anyway. 

Today I (19m) was offered a job at a motorcycle dealership. I love bikes, riding them and being involved in the community, and ever since I've been old enough to think realistically about what I want to do career-wise I've wanted to work as a motorcycle salesman with the end goal of one day owning my own dealership. So I've been working hard to nail down a job at my local Harley Davidson dealer (and I'll be honest I do have a real fetish for Harleys) and today they offered me the job. (And they're gonna pay me a helluva lot more for it).

Since I left high school eighteen months ago I've had two jobs. One which I loved, but was unfortunately only contracted for five months, followed by a long period of unemployment and now my current job in retail. For the record I don't exactly hate my job... I just despise it. Don't get me wrong I've had some good times here, made some good friends and learned valuable skills but management treat us like crap and the place is full of people who don't want to be here. So it feels great to be handing in my notice tomorrow and I'm looking forward to starting my new job after my notice period is up. 

The best thing is that now I can focus on building a long term career doing something that I love. Since finishing high school I've had to watch my mates climb up the career ladder at uni or in their trades while I'm stuck at the bottom with not even a foot on the bottom rung. Now I can catch up to them and regain some quality of life that I lost somewhere.

23,"All throughout my childhood i never had a good relationship with my father. He would yell his lungs out at me every time i made a mistake (when he tried teaching me to drive it would end with him hoarse from screaming and me on the brink of tears), he begrudgingly came to my hockey games twice in 8 years, he never physically abused me but all my life it was pretty clear he didn't want to have me and i could feel the resentment he felt towards me, i was never the son he wanted. 

I can remember when i was 12, he would take my brother and I golfing, i hated every second of it. My father would yell at me to hurry up, to aim my shots better, he would go off at me if anyone else so much as looked like they might wanna play the same hole, as if he never realized other people can be patient when they see a child trying to learn to play. But my father was never patient. It didn't help that some times he would take us out in the middle of a mid winter downpour with hail. Being 12, shivvering, my skin turning blue all the while being terrified by my father who screamed at me for every mistake even a badly aimed putt.

I could never talk to him about any of my problems, every time i wanted to do something with him he would blow it off for work, and he's an independant contractor who makes his own hours. 

The year before last my brother broke off contact with him, he neglected me as much as he could and he laid all his venom on my brother. Lateron, early last year year while driving interstate me and him had a fight, and i wanted to break off contact as well. 

Well that's apparently changed now, since my grandmother (my father's mother) died he's been calling me every other day asking me to visit his place for dinner, to help on his latest job etc... it seems he wants to connect with his sons (i would say ""reconnect"" but he never connected with us before) but the thing is, i frankly don't want to reconnect with him. If he died tomorrow from the pack a day he smokes i dont know if i would shed a tear, if i would be sad or relieved. 

I'm not a hateful person, but my father is, as i've seen from his numerous racist screaming tirades at various family gatherings. But he's still blood and i want to forgive him, but i don't know if i can. His bad parenting has effected me greatly as a person, and not in possitive ways.

I don't know if i should just tell him i don't want to ""connect"" with him (we both live in a small town. It can be hard to fully avoid one-another) or if I should just wait it out till he inevitibly dies of a heart attack or god knows what sort of cancer.

I was sexually abused by one of my teachers in school at least once maybe more but i don't really remember. The only ""real"" person i ever told was a teacher in my second primary school but she didn't believe me and told me ""Stop lying you horrible child"" in reply.

My home life has been mixed my dad was not a very nice person and use to hit me but my mother is a wonderful person as are my sister's and brother. As far as i know my dad didn't hit anybody else in my family.....guess i was just the ""lucky"" one in that regard and i have not told anybody about my dad hitting me. Thankfully my dad left a few years ago.

When i was 17 i started using heroin for about 8-9 months in order to get away from everything but stopped after a friend overdosed.
I started using again a few weeks ago after one of my college lecturers was annoyed at me for missing a day due to it being a relative who passed away's birthday. I was high for like 10 or more days in a row then stopped for 2-3 days but i have been on it every day since i stopped trying to...stop.
Three days ago i was passed out after taking some in my family's living room they were not home but one of my friends came around to speak with me because i hadn't been talking with anybody for a few months. She said she looked in the window and seen me face down on the floor with all the things i use for drugs all over the floor as well. I left the door unlocked so she went in and dragged me upstairs to my room and she binned all my drugs.
She has been very emotional the past few days and she keeps coming around to talk with me. She has been trying to talk me into ""getting better"" and stuff but i just really don't have the fight anymore.

Yesterday i went out to jump off of a bridge and i was about to jump when i seen some people leaving flowers and stuff for somebody. I kind of thought that they didn't really need to see somebody do that so i left. I have had suicidal thoughts most of my life but i cant think of any other time when i've felt this...lost or hopeless.  

If any one care's enough to read more i posted this when i first started feeling like this again. https://redd.it/62v6nz

And i don't know what to end on so....i guess some song lyrics will do.

46,"I mean I'm not totally shit at my job (I work at a really tourist-y cafe, nothing exciting) but I just feel like every shift I'm just not as good as everyone else. I feel like I can't multi-task as well, or find the right buttons on the till as fast as everyone else, or my lattes are a bit worse than everyone else. Idk, I'm not sure if its anxiety or if I'm objectively the worst one there. Which sucks a little when your competition is 16 year olds in some cases (nothing against the teens of the world, it's just a bit of a bummer when you're pushing 21)

Am I just being paranoid or do I just suck it up and accept the fact?",27Apr2017,1
48,"Payday was today. We got a grand. I just paid rent and utilities, and now we only have $87 to last the next two weeks. We still haven't gotten gas or groceries, and we need to get supplies for our four kittens and their momma. I seriously feel like I'm going to fucking vomit. 

My husband is a cop, and I don't have a job. 
I don't even know if I can work anyway, I have major depression and a serious nerve condition that affects my back and arms/hands. 

It's just so frustrating, and I hate it. ",27Apr2017,5
49,"What **are** your thoughts on ticket scalping?


The **Gorillaz** Demon Dayz festival is completely sold out, yet all the resale sites have plenty of tickets at 3x the price.


I missed my chance for a ticket, but to catch all the collaborators **playing** Humanz live is likely worth that price to me.


Do you think the photo ID system of **Glastonbury** has it right **?**


Please answer **Bold**, it is very relevant to the question.",27Apr2017,0
51,"Just had this thought and it kind of freaked me out. Classical depictions of AI show them as cold and calculating; evolved as a ""hive mind"" (where indeed ""evolution"" implies both secularism and progressivism), they are typically envisioned as implicitly socialist if not adamantly communist.

Still, if one developed in the wild today, suckling at the feed of Breitbart and InfoWars, Facebook and Twitter, who can say what popularized fundamentals it might internalize. When you exist as a logical construct, those base premises weigh a lot.

Anyway, that was my nightmare for the day and I wanted to share.",27Apr2017,2
