4,"So, I need to get this off my chest. I'm 19 years old and this happened when I was 16. It still bothers me to this day. In high school, I was a lot different than everyone else. I went to school, hung out with people but I did not party like at all. I started hanging out with a group that I'm going to call ""party group"" because I went to the party with them. I really liked this girl that I'll call L. She was the same age as me. Now, L buried me in the friend zone but I still cared for her and she really wanted me to go. I wanted to have fun and hangout. I get there and L is beyond wasted. Like it was bad. Never thought much of it though. Anyway, so I start chugging pure whiskey and pure vodka and I was feeling fantastic but I still new how to stand up and process what was going on. I see a sausage fest around L, all trying to pull down her pants. Then she started to puke, EVERYWHERE. At that point, the people who were throwing the party were threatening to call the police if we didn't get out. So, L and I are out in the street with nowhere to go. There was no way I was calling my parents, so I called 911. Asked for an ambulance. The amount of vomit coming out was just too much. That's the last thing I remember. I blacked out. 

I woke up laying on a gurney and her on a hospital bed. I waited for a doctor to come in and essentially asked what the fuck happened. Essentially, I passed out due to shock and my blood alcohol level was 1.5 times the legal limit for a legal drinker. (Age limit in Canada is 19). Hers was 3.5 times the legal limit and she had to have her stomach pumped. To this day, I have not been able to go to a party. I drink now because I'm legal age, but I can't drink much. I should forget to mention, L and I no longer talk. It does suck but when I see her posts on Facebook or Instagram I always think what could've happened if I hadn't of been there...",06Jun2017,5
5,"We sat there quietly on the black sand for perhaps ten minutes. Neither of us saying anything. We'd come two long hours and spent a weeks rations to see this.

""It's so dark,"" that was the only thing he could think to say, I suppose.

""I told you that you wouldn't like it."" I said to him, trying to sound like this was all no big deal. I knew I'd have to explain it all to him one day, but exactly how do you start a conversation like that?

""I didn't know it would smell this bad. Did it smell bad before too?"" He looked so curious. I don't know why I expected him to be angry, he'd never known different.

""No. It used to smell very nice. The wind would blow in over the waves and you could close your eyes and imagine *being* the wind and soaring for mile after mile over the water.""

Something in my throat knotted up and I stopped talking before I began to cry.

""Does... does anything live in there now?"" he asked.

""No. Nothing lives there."" I told him. 

We stood in silence awhile, just looking. The breakers rolled in with a sickening sound, like an old man eating without his teeth in. They slid back slowly- leaving thick, black, oily streaks behind.

After a short time he said to me, ""Still, it sounds really nice. I wish I could have seen that.""

I felt my heart jump in my chest at that. ""Me too, son,"" was all I could manage.

I seldom took him outside because I didn't know how to explain all the wrong that had come before him. I tried to avoid a million questions I didn't know how to answer by keeping him safe inside The Dome.

“Daddy?” he asked, “What did flowers smell like?”

It took awhile before I could answer. You just can't explain certain things. What does red look like? How does a tomato taste? How comforting is a father's hug? What does a flower smell like?

“There were lots of kinds of flowers,” I spat out, hoping I'd know how to finish. “They each smelled different in their own way.”

“I've never even smelled *one*,” he told me.

“I know, son. I know.” I clasped a hand on his shoulder and he hugged my waist. I felt his chest heave and his shoulders begin to hitch up and down. I crouched down on my haunches and looked into his watery eyes.

“Remember when mama used to hold you and sing to you when you were a little guy?” I asked.

His chest heaved again, and he took a second to calm his breath and beat the tears back. “Kinda,” he said. “I remember her... but most times it's just her face.”

“She was very pretty,” I said. This not so much to him but out loud to no one in particular.

“She was,” I heard myself in his voice for the first time ever.

“You remember that much?” I asked him. My heart was breaking in my chest. I never should have brought him here.

“I remember... I remember her singing to me,” he said. He hesitated and I almost persisted but then he continued, “It was so pretty but...,” his throat tightened up and he stopped.

“But you can't remember the words?” I asked. He broke then and threw his arms around my waist as he sobbed.

“I CAN'T!” he heaved and struggled against me as the pain poured out.

""I can't either,"" I promised him. That was a lie.

“Shh,” I whispered. “Just calm yourself.” I told him. “What else do you remember?”

“She would would hold me and explained how it would be like this forever and told me it would be okay,” he said through his tears and in between sobbing breaths. “It's not okay though! Nothing is okay!” he was getting angry now. It was about time.

“What else do you remember?” I asked again.

“About her?” he seemed confused.

“About her,” I confirmed.

“She...” he trailed off. I watched his eyes gaze off blankly into the dark expanse before us.

After a few moments he raised his head and looked into my eye- tears still welling up in his own. “Her hair,” he finally managed.

“Her hair?” I could remember his mother's bright red hair gleaming in the sun. It seemed to deny our future simply by refusing to dull in spite of the inevitability of our fate. It shone in the face of the darkness we'd set before ourselves.

He looked at me as if I were mad to even question him. I couldn't blame him.

“Yes. Her hair. It smelled so good,” he told me. “She would hold me tight and I'd shove my face into her hair and it smelled sweet. Almost like when the matrons make honey-rolls for breakfast on the holidays.” 

“Almost?” I asked.

“Almost. Not quite,” he said.

“You remember that much?” I asked once more.

“I do. I don't quite remember her face and I can't really see it,"" His face wrinkled just as mine did when I was lost for words. ""I know her hair smelled like fresh baked honey-rolls.” He trailed off and began to cry again. I hugged him closer.

“You know,"" I began, ""flowers were just like that.” I told him.

“They smelled like honey-rolls?” he asked.

“Not all of them, and not exactly,” I said then. “But all of them smelled sweet in a way you could almost describe perfectly but could never get exactly right no matter how hard you try.”

We sat like that for a few more minutes and watched the black, oily waves lap at the shore.

After a time he spoke up. “I can imagine flowers that smelled like her.” he said. ""They'd be pretty."" His face twisted then and he broke down- sobbing uncontrollably. 

I put my arm around him then and held him while he cried. 

“You've got it just right.” I told him. ",06Jun2017,2

9,"I just started a job working in a factory measuring large quantities of food to be made into sauces. The hours are 2am to whenever we get done, usually around 10 or 11, then sometimes do other jobs till 1 or 2pm.

All the raw concentrated ingredients made me sick, violently throwing up (in a bathroom, away from all food).

I am a 26 year old guy in full time employment. I want to take the trip of a lifetime and do a 12 month program abroad next year.

I'm worried about what to do when I return though. I won't be able to move back into my parents as they moved away some time ago, and I won't have a job waiting for me.

What's the best way to make sure I don't end up homeless and jobless when I get back after the 12 months? I don't see how it's possible to move straight into an apartment without a viewing, or without arranging others to share with. 

The program doesn't pay particularly well, I want to do it for the experience more than anything. I'll be coming back into the country (UK) with more or less the same money I left with.",06Jun2017,20

-Straight white males are the leading number for homeless

-I wonder why the suicide rate is higher......oh, because we deal with all the shit you give us and what we get from the rest of the world

-We have higher standards to live up to, unrealistic standards

-Where's my privilege to not be poor? To get an education? To get everything minorities get for free?

-Women pretty much live for fucking free and use men for financial gain or otherwise

-Women get off crimes easier

-Woman fucks a minor? Apparently that's okay. A man does it? Apparently that's wrong though women doing it is okay. What? Neither is okay! Makes you think though, when it was the norm some years ago.

-Males are homeless primarily due to shit caused by women, example: child support, for a shitty mother, and the better/great father get's fucked by the court system, because of this illusion that women/mothers are innocent and perfect. I know first hand how bullshit that is, I was allegedly birthed by one of those women

-Males suffer a hugely greater chance of work injury or death

-Males do more work than women yet get paid the same and sometimes less than women who do less labor-intensive work or otherwise

-Women are sneakier and hide their wrong-doings better, because they care more. Guys care less. Thus helping the false image of men and women, when in reality, women are just as bad as men in every single way, if not worse.

-Straight white males get blamed for everything, even when it's not their fault, have nothing to do with it, or when the people blaming them are causing their own problems, or don't want to do anything to solve their own problems

-Double standards

-Many men die in wars, many women do not

-Men are considered disposable",06Jun2017,0

39,"I lost my wife.  I guess I didn’t lose her, I mean I know where she is. What I mean is I lost the relationship.  I didn’t take her feelings seriously.  I mean I took her seriously 95% of the time, but that 5% festered into 100% resentment.  Sometimes you read some shit on the internet and you think wow that sounds just like me.  In this case it’s pretty amazing how this article, https://mustbethistalltoride.com/2016/01/14/she-divorced-me-because-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink/, hits everything on the head.

Now that I’m done blaming her, the nonexistent other guy, her friends, I’ve figured out it’s my fault.  So I’m writing this so hopefully someone else gets it before it’s too late. I’m also writing this to try and get past it because I’m struggling. I’d be lying if I didn’t say part of me wants her to read this and think “damn he finally gets it, maybe we can work this out”.  I don’t think I’m going to tell her I posted this.  I’m trying this whole not being selfish thing (it’s harder than you might think).

I thought we were fine. Sure we had some ups and downs, but never was I worried we were on the outs. I thought I was doing more than enough to make her feel the same way. I mean I go to work, I tell her she’s beautiful, surprise her with flowers, love the kids.  Sure she wishes I would pay more attention to dumb shit, like dishes, or not so dumb shit, like taking more of the responsibilities with our daughter.  But I can’t help that she always goes to mommy first, and I mean god its only dishes. I get it, your upset I sat down and played a video game instead of picking up the toys, but she’s just going to take them out again and can’t I just relax a bit? I just got home from work.  Look I just don’t see it; if you could just ask me to do something I’ll do it.   I mean I’ve always been there for you haven’t I? I’m pretty sure I show you I love you. 
 
I was right too, it was small shit. But small shit turned into big resentments, then bigger resentments, then I don’t think we will ever be the same and I can’t do this anymore sized resentments.  I love you but I’m not in love with you type stuff.  Living awkwardly together until I can move out shit. 

If you’re still reading this, I’m fucking shocked, but take my advice. If you love someone never get comfortable. Don’t ever feel like you are doing “enough”.  Take everything that’s serious to your other seriously. Don’t let a five second inconvenience turn into figuring out how you are going to make it on your own.  Really just pay attention. And read that link above.  That guys is way better with words than I am. 
Thanks.

41,"This is a phrase that gets thrown around a lot these days, especially on Reddit, and it pisses me off to no end. It seemed to initially stem from the idea that 'feelings' should not dictate the law, or the outcome of a court case, (which I agree with) but it has become a reason for people to justify their sociopathic behaviour to themselves and the communities they post in, and only serves to encourage more people to say really nasty shit.

""So what if you're offended? Who cares?""

Why is it cool to not care about other peoples feelings now? What happened to the idea that we should treat each other with some respect? Not everyone with feelings is some 'spooky scary SJW' from the depths of Tumblr who wants to take away your freedom of speech, some people just think you ought to take your douchebaggery elsewhere.

51,"Almost two weeks ago I got fired from my new job. I was surprised, not expecting it at all. Before that I was a maid breaking my body to the point I found it hard to work more than a few days a week by the end of the second year doing that. Anyway, point of that is, I was already tight for money. 

Day after I got fired, I discovered that quite sometime ago, my identity got stolen. No wonder I was never able to take out any loans or credit.

For the last three or so days I was eating this one ugly concoction of soup and rice and seeds and egg. Made one can of soup last three days. But today, soon after I ate it, I got really sick. Stupid me, I wasn't being very food-safe with the food. 

Today I went and got myself three more cans of soup, which I plan on eating for the next week. Instead of just looking at the ingredients this time (I always get something packed with vegetables to try to get some nutrients) This time I decided to take a look at how many calories were in a can. There's about 300. I've been living off of about half of 300 calories a day, plus whatever gets added from rice and egg. Maybe 600 calories? Plus, I see this guy who always brings me beer when he sees me, so I guess I get a lot of calories about twice a week from that.

I don't know how much I weigh, but it's definitely noticeably smaller. I can't afford to take a bus anywhere so I walk, but it takes every bit of my willpower not to stop and take sit breaks. I'm having trouble standing up the whole time in the shower anymore.

I just feel so out of options. At least now maybe I could consider school once I work out how to clean my identity up and get a loan, but that is obviously on the sidelines until I've got a job and am not desperate for the day anymore.

You wouldn't know I'm starving or have been starving on a regular rotating business a lot of my life. I look very normal, clean clothes, clean hair and always spend money on rent first. My teeth are in desperate need of fillings though. I have four cavities I found out about a year ago and I've noticed three new holes in the enamel of the front of my teeth.

My friends all tell me I need to get out and enjoy my life a little but honestly I can't be bothered, and I have no idea where I'd even begin. I have nothing out there for me to do. No obvious talents. Nothing that sparks a passion in me. Today was especially bad. I was bored as fuck all day, and my room was too warm. Near the end of the day I just opened my window and stood there for a few minutes, letting the breeze hit me. It felt good. And I realised that was the best fucking moment of my whole day. Just standing at my window staring off at nothing. I genuinely shed a few tears when I realised this, cause it just shows how fucking pointless my life's getting.

Another thing my friends say is that I 'need a girlfriend'. I've always been a hopeless romantic, and I'd love a girlfriend. Never had one though. Not that I don't get my hopes up. Hell, there's a girl right now who I'm completely head over fucking heels for and she's one of the few people I know who always enjoys my company. But I know the exact reason I've never had a relationship, I just can't fix it. It's cause any relationship I get into would become my only source of happiness, you know? People can sense that kind of desperation. You can't have that, that's too much pressure for anyone. Nobody wants to be with someone like that. I think this girl only likes me cause I can be pretty funny and I'm really approachable. Once she, hell anyone else, realises I have literally NOTHING of interest going on in my life, they're not gonna want to stick around. 

Hell, why would they? I know that by being like this I'm pushing people away, but I literally have no idea how to build a normal life for myself. Sure, I done good enough in school, but I have no idea what career I want, where I want my life to go, what my interests or passions are, nothing. Sometimes it feels like I'm barely even a person, just a shell who pretends they're living a life. Doing the whole college and a part time job time, pretending it means something. For others it's a means to an end, to progress to their future goals, but for me it's all I've got. And the sad thing is, while occasionally like today I get down about it, 95% of the time I honestly don't give enough of a fuck to change it. Part of me is kind of content with all this. My life is just fucking hollow and I don't have a clue how to even begin to change it, or even know if I want to.",06Jun2017,7
