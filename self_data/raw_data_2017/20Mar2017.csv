3,"Hi Reddit. 18/M here. 

My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over two years now. It was the typical high school relationship at first but we kept going and going and have fallen in love. We've been the best we've ever been as of late (haven't fought in months) and I thought we were pretty smooth sailing.

But pretty recently (last week) we had a talk where she told me that she feels like she needs to find out ""who she is"" outside of our relationship before she promises anything further/continues our relationship. It was a rollarcoaster of a week, with her changing her mind on me and saying it was nothing, but then going back the next day. 

We came to a point where we agreed to give it another month or two and then we'd talk about where we are and go from there (kinda implying that if she feels the same way, we're gonna end things). 

TL;DR:

My girlfriend says she ""doesn't really know who she is"" because we're both pretty young and have been in our relationship for a while, and she hasn't had time to find out who she is and what kind of decisions she'd make outside of our relationship. She says she wants time to ""love herself"" before dating any further. 

I feel like shit about the whole thing because I want what's best for her and don't know if this is it or not. I love her and am thinking if it'd be the loving thing to let go or not? I'm pretty lost and a mess, I don't know what to do. 

I just needed to rant somewhere because most of
our friends are all mutual and I don't want it to get out. 

Thanks ",20Mar2017,1
6,"In that legion there were two very brave men, centurions, who were now approaching the first ranks, Titus Pullō et Lūcius Vorēnus. These used to have continual disputes between them, which of them should be preferred, and every year used to contend for promotion with the utmost animosity. When the fight was going on most vigorously before the fortifications, Pullō, one of them, says, ""Why do you hesitate, Vorēnus? or what opportunity of signalizing your valor do you seek? This very day shall decide our disputes."" When he had uttered these words, he proceeds beyond the fortifications, and rushes on that part of the enemy which appeared the thickest. Nor does Vorēnus remain within the rampart, but respecting the high opinion of all, follows close after. Then, when an inconsiderable space intervened, Pullō throws his javelin at the enemy, and pierces one of the multitude who was running up, and while the latter was wounded and slain, the enemy cover him with their shields, and all throw their weapons at the other and afford him no opportunity of retreating. The shield of Pullō is pierced and a javelin is fastened in his belt. This circumstance turns aside his scabbard and obstructs his right hand when attempting to draw his sword: the enemy crowd around him when embarrassed. His rival runs up to him and succors him in this emergency. Immediately the whole host turn from Pullō to him, supposing the other to be pierced through by the javelin. Vorēnus rushes on briskly with his sword and carries on the combat hand to hand, and having slain one man, for a short time drove back the rest: while he urges on too eagerly, slipping into a hollow, he fell. To him, in his turn, when surrounded, Pullō brings relief; and both having slain a great number, retreat into the fortifications amid the highest applause. Fortune so dealt with both in this rivalry and conflict, that the one competitor was a succor and a safeguard to the other, nor could it be determined which of the two appeared worthy of being preferred to the other.

7,"It's almost midnight and I can't sleep so here goes my rambling.

I've been having this fantasy for years where I'm on a flight, departing to who knows where, and before takeoff an absolutely stunning girl sits next to me. I don't think anything of it at first until she notices me fucking around on my phone and asks me about it to strike up a conversation. From there it just goes on forever, with every topic being touched upon: movies, art, music, life, etc. We completely ignore our surroundings and delve deeper and deeper into our personalities until we land, and God knows where it goes from there.

While reading over this I realized it sounds like a teenage girl's bad fan fiction, but I don't care - it's late at night and I need to get it out and go to bed. Thank you to anyone who was strong enough to read all of my horrendous writing (I guess I never took anything out of that high school creative writing class).",20Mar2017,6
8,"I've never submitted to self, so please excuse me if I make any mistakes. Also, this entire post is going to be a lot of rambling, but I feel the need to talk about it.

Anyways, here we go.

I (17M) am dating a girl (17F) from my school who has high functioning ASD and a range of other emotional and psychological problems stemming from abuse as a child. As a result of this, Handling PTSD-induced panic attacks have become a normal part of life for me now when I spend time with her.

The other day I was sitting in my 4th hour class bored out of my mind when I was called down to the Student Administration office. I had no idea what was up, and since being called down to STAD is generally for disciplinary purposes, I was a bit anxious. When I arrived, I was ushered into a room with two of the VP's. They sit me down and tell me that in the room adjacent to where I was sitting was my girlfriend, who was very upset for reasons they didn't understand. All they knew was that, upon being found crying in a hallway, all she did was ask for me.

When I entered the room, I saw my girlfriend in a fetal position on a chair opposite the desk, sobbing unlike anything I have ever seen before. Immediately I offered to take her home, since I knew she has a bunny that she uses for emotional support and to help ease herself following a panic attack (Her mom was two towns over and couldn't get there in a reasonable amount of time, so I took the initiative regarding that). After getting permission from the VP and my parents, I took her home and got her tucked into bed with her bunny.

It was at this point that she began to suffer from a brief bout of retrograde amnesia as a result of the extreme stress that she was under. She got up from her bed, looked at me with a confused face, then ran out of the room. I found her in the living room trying to figure out where she was and who I was.

This is the part that likely will likely change my life.

The moment that she asked who I was, and I responded with my name, her eyes opened wide and she ran and almost tackled me in a hug. Later that day after she had calmed down and became her normal bubbly self, she told me that the moment that I said my name, she felt an overwhelming sense of calmness, and in that moment, she wouldn't have rather had anybody else be by her side to help her through the attack.

Before dating her, I had no experience with anybody who has ASD, or suffers from PTSD induced panic attacks. But now that I am experiencing first hand what those entail, I can't imagine how I could have lived without experiencing the extreme depths of happiness and love that are produced by individuals with those conditions. While there are certainly hard times (The panic attack that I described took over 3 painful hours, for instance.), knowing that we are there for each other when the going gets rough certainly makes it worth it.

Anyways, that's my little story.",20Mar2017,27
11,"I have four neighbors that are 19-22-ish, and they're really nice, friendly kids that remind me (well, I'm only 27) what it was like to be a cheerful young adult. But on Saturday nights they get together with like a Bible study group of like 15 and it turns into singing worship songs past 11pm, sometimes as late as 2am. 

And I get it. I grew up a staunch Evangelical Christian, worked at a Christian summer camp as a counselor, did all the same shit. That's probably why I've never complained to them about the hardcore worship music. It's like two accoustic guitars and someone on a drum box, and they don't so much sing, but scream, all out of key. 

I even recognize most of the songs they sing. It's a very Dashboard Conventional-ish. The lyrics are terribly dull. 

""JEEZ-US MY LOOOORD, I WONT WALK WITHOUT YOU."" As if screaming this in repetition is what J-man, the holy ghost and the big man are like super interested in hearing. 

We live in a small community where the houses are packed close together with large backyards, and I'm just so happy someone had the gusto to call the cops last night, because it was getting ridiculous. I mean, if they were at least in the same key, and not screaming.. I would just turn on my fan and smoke a bowl. But it's aggressively annoying.

12,"The hurt I have at this moment is where in a spaceless time, there is no sound, no light but cold and loneliness with the feeling of being torn over and over again. And yet, that doesn't come close to the hurt I feel. I want to hurt him - I want him to feel the same pain. What would that accomplish. You are not cruel or mean. Did he care, why doesn't he.

13,"My wife and I have been married 17 years but have been having trouble for the past couple years. About 5 years ago I had an affair with her younger sister. To make the whole thing worse, I tried telling my wife but her sister denied it and my wife believed her. She thought I made it up to hurt her. 

My wife filled for divorce a couple years ago. I obviously deserved it. She didn't believe me about her sister, but I was so messed up that I was giving her lots of other reasons to leave. It doesn't matter what problems we had. I was complete trash for how I treated her.

While split, I started going to counseling for many of my problems. My wife and I worked things out enough that we got back together. We started counseling together. Things got a bit better and she wanted to stop counseling. We still have issues but are working on them together, just without counseling.

I haven't brought up the affair lately but it weighs on me. Part of me feels like I already told her and part feels like I am lying. Should I forget about this? I can't imagine that it will actually help my wife to learn the truth and that assumes she even believes me this time. Her sister got married about a year ago. They weren't together but I could cause them trouble. Their family hates me and will accuse me of trying to hurt them both.

I'm trying to convince her that we need more counseling. She says she doesn't want to keep reliving the past. I care about her. I've been given another chance and don't want to screw it up. I just don't know what to do at this point.",20Mar2017,3

There's a girl in one of my classes who is attractive to me, but I have no idea how I can actually start a conversation. Once I get going with someone, it's no problem, but I can never find a way to naturally start without coming off weird. Asking a question about class usually goes nowhere, and using a compliment almost immediately triggers the ""I have a boyfriend"" response even if I weren't trying to hit on them.

A lot of this applies to dudes as well. In my first year of college I've made 1 friend total, and they started the conversation with me.",20Mar2017,1
16,"I hadn't eaten all day, and decided to get some pizza since I hadn't gotten it in a few weeks. I hadn't tried deep dish yet (I'm in Chicago) and I've been here 2 months, so I had to try it. Anyway, I ordered the pizza, which took me about an hour considering how many options there were. I spent $21, I've never spent that much on pizza before.  
I walked there, and I've walked this way around 50 or so times, I'm very comfortable with the route now. Went to the pizza place, waited for my pizza, got said pizza and left.   

On the way home I was walking the same speed as I was to get there, which was quite fast. I saw a bunch of shady guys standing around a corner and I thought to myself ""whoa those are some shady looking guys right there."" And then there was another shady looking guy walking up the pavement to that corner just after me. I just carried on and minded my own business, kept walking. I had both earphones in, listening to music, and I was counting the amount of distance I had left till I got home so I could eat this pizza.  

Then all of a sudden, BAM. I feel a fist collide with my head at such a force I was thrown into confusion. I think he ran up on me but it was the guy who was walking the pavement up to the corner, and he was absolutely pummeling me over, and over, and over and over again, not stopping at all. He kept punching me in the face so hard and in the head and just all over my general body and I was screaming at him that I didn't have anything and I was scared for my life.    
My glasses by this point had long since fallen off and I had no idea what was going to happen to me. He just kept punching me, even when I thought it would stop he just carried on. I think I managed to defend myself but it all happened so fast I didn't have time to process anything. He beat the shit out of me, and after I'd screamed for the 4th time that I didn't fucking have anything, he finally stopped. He slowly walked backwards, looking at me with a face of pure rage, picked up a slice of pizza off the floor, and ran off. Guy looked about 24.  

I was fucking livid. I was absolutely fucking fueled with hate and anger for this cunt. How absolutely cunty of a person do you have to be to hurt someone else this bad for some fucking pizza? AND HE ONLY TOOK THE ONE FUCKING SLICE. THAT'S DEEP DISH YOU FUCKNUGGET, AT LEAST TAKE MORE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM EATING IT OFF THE FLOOR, CUNTBAG.   

I stood there for a bit, regained my composure, or what was left of it, and just leaned against a gate, my coat and pants messy with pizza. I don't have any bruises or scars but my jaw is kinda fucked and it aches when I chew. I think I took that beating pretty well. Didn't cry and all the pain went away almost as soon as he ran away. I don't even care that he beat me up, what angers me the most is that when I buy pizza it's supposed to last me quite a few dinners, (I'm a student) and usually lasts me 4 days. So I've lost $21 and now I'll have to sort something else out. Making myself a sandwich at 1am was not how I wanted to spend tonight.    

I screamed a few vulgarities in the air even though I knew he couldn't hear me; he was long gone. There was an old woman across the street and I'm not sure if she saw what happened and wanted to help or just thought the street pole was a bus stop. She watched as I got back up. Shit, maybe she wasn't there at all.   

In the end I started laughing like that crazy laugh people do for no reason sometimes. I was okay, life would go on. I wanted to make jokes about it as soon as possible so there wouldn't be a period of it to hurt me mentally; making fun of the situation would help relieve the stress. I laughed a little on the way home, then really stuck with the fact he only took one slice. I mean come on man, if you're gonna mug me and beat the ever-living shit out of me, at least take the whole fucking pizza. God, this guy makes the whole mugging community look bad.

23,"Throwaway because this feels slightly edgy and there are people who know my real reddit account. Huge mistake telling them. Also, not really sure if this is the best sub for this. Let me know if it isn't and I can post it somewhere else. 

Great Wall of Text incoming but before I start, I want to strongly emphasize that I am **NOT** depressed or anything like that... Just conflicted, really. I think that with this post, I'm really just laying everything on the table for me to get my thoughts in order. Who knows? Maybe this will help someone else as well.

I work as a receptionist at a small startup in a fairly large, metropolitan city and also in college. Since I’m pretty damn introverted, you could probably already tell that this isn’t exactly the best job for me, but I figured that the job is really easy and I could also do some homework while I’m here, so it works pretty well. After a while, I came to the realization that I just flat out dislike speaking with people face to face and pretending to be this super kind and caring person. I know it’s my job and all, but it’s just really exhausting to have fake conversations with people that I don’t care about. Anyway, all of that made me notice that a lot of us have these jobs and obligations that we strongly dislike committing to relating to things that we don't care about at all. What’s the whole point of this? Do we ***really*** have to do this?

Growing up, I've never been passionate about anything at all except playing video games. Even now, all I really enjoy doing is being happy while playing video games with my online buds. It's the only thing I've ever liked doing since I was less than 10 years old. Had very few friends in real life mostly because I really enjoy being alone much more than I enjoy being around others, and pretty religious parents who would gasp instantly if they ever even heard the word ""Hell"" being spoken around the house. I went to church with them every Sunday and always felt as though I didn't belong there. Something felt very wrong with it, and I felt like it just wasn't the ""right way"" to find spiritual achievement. I never felt a connection. I'll get back to this thought later.

Similarly to pretty much everyone who was ever a kid in a wealthy country, I was told that when I grow into adulthood, I should choose a path that would assure me some sort of ""success"", whatever that word means anymore. We'll call this path, ""The Safe Path"". I was also told that any path other than The Safe Path would essentially lead to impending doom and failure. I've been thinking about what it means to really be a ""Success"" and what it means to be a ""Failure"", and I realized that these words seem pretty subjective when it comes to speaking about life in general. In my opinion, the two words are almost synonymous with ""Happiness"" and ""Misery"" in a way. What may make me happy may make someone else completely miserable, and that's okay. As humans, we're all different from one another and we all lead very different lives and are born into very different circumstances. It's obvious, but it's why we have different religions, political stances, and ideas that make us who we are. 

Does the fact that we have different views on pretty much everything make our opinions redundant? I'd argue so. However, I will always refuse to believe that nothing happens after our deaths. It just doesn't make sense to me that I would die someday and not have anything happen after. There has to be SOMETHING out there, right? Popular world religions believe in very differing ideologies, and this causes us to be a really divided world. The only thing I really believe in is self-happiness. We probably won't ever be able to figure out what happens after we die, so just be happy and wait to die. 

Every day, I care less and less about real life and continuously, slowly sink into this state of wanting to just have it all be over, but **NOT** committing suicide or anything like that. It's almost like this curiosity to find out what's on that other side that everyone thinks about. 

These are my real feelings. This post is extremely cluttered, vague, and unedited, so it's really just raw thoughts coming out here. Laying everything in place feels pretty relieving but reading this to myself really leaves me with several ideas that relate to taking/trying some of ""The Roads Less Traveled."" This is something I need to think way more about, but I think that if I really want to enjoy my life, it'd be much better if I spent it doing something that I believe is worth my time rather than doing something I hate doing to just to keep appearances up and do what society expects me to do. Societal expectations just suck. 

I know everything above seems like nonsense and rambling that spawned out of angst, but these are thoughts I've had for forever. This is not a phase, and I'm sure of it. What I'm trying to get out of my system is that I'm exhausted of this life. This life where you're kind of just expected to do what everyone else tells you to do, and if you don't you're a failure. I would really love a change because I don't care at all about what people think of me, and I think I don't care to the point where it's beginning to show and affect my daily life in a way that makes me look depressed on the outside, but on the inside I'm just so damn bored of the typicality. 

Here's what I don't get: Do we really have to spend the majority of our lives working on either our schooling or careers just so we can spend a small part of our lives with a small amount of happiness? It just really sucks, but I can see why it might be ""the best way"" to some people to live life. It's just so boring to me. Can we do something else somehow? I wanna try something different.

Thoughts, anyone? I could use a second pair of eyes here. I must admit, I feel ridiculous posting this.",20Mar2017,3
26,"I'm asking out a girl after class, I'm hoping she says yes! 

For context, check my last post I made here. 

FOLLOW UP: 

So things didn't go as I thought it might've gone, in fact it was a very weird day. During lab, I noticed that she was feeling ill, and so I offered to get her some medicine for what I thought was a headache. Surely afterwards, I then came to the realization that she was in her period and had to help her go to the bathroom over the pain she had. Once that cleared up, I asked her after an hour or so. The answer was unexpected to say the least. 

She was into me, but as we kept talking she casually mentioned that she had recently broken up with her boyfriend. The catch? I find out that the guy was a friend of mine that told me he had broken up with a girl  due to her being manipulative, obsessive and annoying. Once I put two and two together, I quickly backed off from it. I honestly dodged a huge bullet there. 

After class, I went to the student center and sat down at one of the tables feeling so sad, but not enough to make me cry. It was then that a girl showed up with a kitten that was finding anyone who would adopt it, and had the kitten be my emotional support for an hour. The girl told me noticed my sadness, and thought it would be a great idea to have the kitten cheer me up. I decided to helped her find a person who would adopt the kitten, whom we then found about half and hour in the search. It was a grandmother, who was waiting for her grandson from his final class, that saw the kitten with overwhelming joy. After giving her the kitten, I told the girl had to go back to my car, and offered to tag along. We talked at the way there, we then realized that we had a lot in common, we studied in the same department, but she goes to class in the afternoon unlike me that I take the classes in the morning. She wants to meet up again, and we exchanged phone numbers. To be honest, I did not expect any of these events to unfold. It just happened so suddenly that I had to take a shower to clear my thoughts in order to compile them here. 

**TL;DR**: Dodged a bullet after realizing that the girl was hitting on me after breaking up with a guy I know from another class that said very negative things about her. Went to the student center to sit down, felt miserable, a girl with a kitten showed up as emotional support, and after finding someone who adopted the kitten, we hit it off, and got her phone number asking if she wanted to meet up again.

27,"20 March is the day of Fred Rogers' birth, a man more colloquially known as [Mr. Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers). When you go out and enjoy the day, remember that every stranger you meet can be a friend if you want them to be.

I make the same post every year, but this year I thought I'd do something a little different. Recently, US President Donald Trump laid out his budget, which levies devastating cuts to public arts and broadcasting, as well as educational programs. In particular, PBS would be [eviscerated](https://deadline.com/2017/03/pbs-response-donald-trump-budget-proposal-1202044526/).

In 1969, Mr. Rogers testified in front of a senate panel to [defend funding to PBS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXEuEUQIP3Q) in the wake of President Nixon's desire to cut funding to it. He ensured that educational programs, such as his own and Sesame Street, would survive to educate kids for decades to come.

Now, that funding is in danger. While Trump's budget isn't the final budget that will be passed, it is a guideline for congress to develop the actual federal budget. Much of Trump's budget cuts hit environmental agencies, social programs, science, and education, while there will be a planned increase in defense spending. 

Please reach out to your local representative and consider the small amount of money (less than .5% of the budget) it actually takes to fund public broadcasting and educational programs, which are necessary for so many children and families out there.

Thank you, and have a wonderful day.",20Mar2017,2
29,"It frustrates me because there's a lot of human beauty in big cities. Some of those things can be annoying- like noise, but after awhile city noise just becomes this omnipresent buzz of life. It's kind of beautiful when you think about it.

From grungy alleyways to huge high rises I feel like there's beauty everywhere. Look at the angles the buildings take in the alley, or that green park surrounded by an ocean of concrete. The ultra modern buildings contrasted with buildings that have been there for a hundred years or more. The old advertisements that  hang around through the ages.

I can't believe the amount of stuff that we can learn online.

This is personal you might not care but I need to get it out!!

At first, I learned Pure Data, a programming language for musician .

I got good at it, so I learned about Python. I now have a beginner/intermediate level at it, so I decided I would try to learn Machine Learning as well.

But there was too much math, so I decided to slow that a bit and learn about math too. 

As I keep learning more thing, it turns there's a lot of computer sciences focused towards music. So I took Machine Learning for Musicians and artists and programming in ChucK for musicians

Later, my teacher told me he could pull some strings for me if I learned german. So I did.

Anyway, you know the end of the story, as I keep learning I realize there's so much that I don't know so I just keep learning and I'm kinda addicted to it now.

36,"I live in a house with four other people and my friend (we will call him Joe), and his fiancé (we will call her Sara) live in the basement, and the rest of us guys live upstairs. I have known Joe for a little under 2 years and Sara for just as long. They have always had a rough relationship from what I hear and they recently got engaged over the summer. Sara (22F) and I (21M) have had a strong connection since the day we met. Recently many things happened in her personal life (about 6 weeks ago) and Joe was not there for her emotionally or physically. Me being me, I comforted her and made myself 100% available to her because she needed it and I could not stand watching her be upset and sad. We have been texting and talking to each other all the time recently and we both expressed how we felt. She explained how she was unhappy in her relationship and that she has liked me since the day we met her. I said that I could not stand to see her hurt and that I care about her more than anything and expressed how I thought she deserves so much more. We both talked about how hard we were falling for one another and how messed up the situation is but neither of us knew what to do. We kissed and made out on a couple occasions, we never had sex although we both said how much we wanted too and definitely got close a couple time but it never happened. I have had conversations with her in the past week that have been really hard for me and seeing Joe and her together and living with them is very hard feeling the way I feel. 
Last night I went to a semi-formal dance with Joe, Sara and a small group of friends and I had too much to drink. I was dancing with my friend (22F) and then Sara got jealous and sent “fuck you” to me via phone I did not know what to do. My heart was shattering and I was having a breakdown because I just wanted to be able to talk to her about things but I couldn’t at that time. My friends drove me home and it became obvious to Joe that I had feelings for Sara. After I got home, I couldn’t stop thinking about her and tried calling her (too many times) and I decided to walk back into town to try to find her to talk. She never responded and I never found her. Early this morning I got a message from Sara saying that what we are doing is over and how she could not believe how I reacted last night. I agreed that it should be over and said I was sorry at least 10 times. Joe said we needed to talk and I agreed because at this point I wanted to tell him everything because he deserved to know. Joe and I went on a walk and I told him everything, he said he understood how I got feelings for her, and that he does not trust Sara or me, and that if he forgives me it will take a long time. I have not talked to Sara at all besides saying sorry and that one message I got from her this morning. Now I am guessing that neither of them wants anything to deal with me and I don’t blame them and feel terrible for getting in between their relationship. My other friends and roommates are all aware of the situation and think that she is selfish and doesn’t deserve to be with either of us. However, I still care about her so much but I know I need to let it go. 
I don’t know what to do now.

39,"I finally went to a dentist for the first time in three years. I was expecting bad news but not as bad as the news they gave me. Apparently I have 30 cavities, and my wisdom teeth are fucked up too. It's going to take 7 sessions total to fix everything, and my insurance maxes out for the year after the first two sessions. After insurance kicks out I'm looking to pay out of pocket for the following sessions between 800-900 dollars (about 4600 dollars overall). Looking at everything is pretty overwhelming. To top it off, on the drive home from the office my car was making some really nasty noises. I think my breaks are going out. I'm so done right now.",20Mar2017,132
40,"i write something about it to get it of my mind and i do it with a throwaway to not get my friends on reddit who happen to know my username what happened to me today, they know the person involved but not what happened.

i am writing this to get it of my chest and i will surely talk with you about it because i think it helps me process it faster.
please note tho that i am german and my english may not be perfect.


exposition: two days ago i kissed a friend of mine. we dated a year ago which not resultet in anything, then she got in a relationship, then she was single again and started to bond with me closer, texting more, drinking more and so on.
anyways two days ago we got really drunk and kissed.


I thought now we may can come together but we met a few minutes ago to dring a beer together and she laid out to me that that will not be the case. 

i didnt want to ask for a reason why because then my brain would begin to nibble on that reason. i did, what was not very wise and the reason was that she dont likes to be in a relationship.


she says she feels to cramped in relationships.

now that is something that i cant get around. my brain cant procces it. i mean she cant know if she would feel the same way with me does she?
i even asked her to tell me another reasen, it may even be a lie, that is not questionable for me. some reasonable incompability. but she wouldnt.
she is a really tough women and as you can guess pretty independent. so i didnt really want to argue much about it although my brain immediatly and still had many things to say against it.

feel free to write what ever you think. i just wanted to get it of my mind an write it down somewhere.
TL;DR 
kissed a friend, got rejected, my brain cant get around the reason.

41,"So I have been using reddit actively for years now. And I am pissed off at the amount of moderation that goes on here now. The main subs especially have a ridiculous amount of rules. Some even make you 'agree' to them before posting. 

I always thought what made Reddit great was that we choose what is good content and what is bad content. If a post is shit it will get downvoted and few people will ever even see it. 

And every god damn thread post that makes it to /r/all seems to have that stupid obnoxiously long stickied post telling us that this is a place for civil discussion. I've been on these threads plenty enough to know that this stupid message doesn't stop the uncivil people from being uncivil. 

What are your thoughts?",20Mar2017,2
43,Just needed to vent somewhere. For the second time in my life my mom and sister got rid of a family dog while I was away. Once again without telling me or letting me say good. I'm just extremely let down and will probably spend the rest to my day crying.,20Mar2017,7
44,"I'm waiting for my passport. I want to leave the US. No, not because of Trump or any of that, the cia and nsa have been causing massive problems in my life. Yes, it's real, and it sucks. They're psychos, and a few of them are seemingly obsessed with me, and it sucks. There's nothing to be done, but to get my dog and I out of the nation ASAP.

I'm thinking Holland, or Russia. First a walking/bus tour around Europe, Spain, France, Italy, Switzerland, and Germany with my dog to kind of free my mind up, shake off the ugliness that the cia/nsa have brought into my life.

It's a weird thing, you know? I have to learn a new language, start a new company, new family, find a new woman, all of that stuff. It sucks. okcupid sucks too. I'm checking it out and it's like you can msg 100 women and maybe get a slight reply back from one, turning it into a numbers game, which ruins the whole thing. I'm sure women have a horrible time on there as well. What a shit site. I'm trying tinder, but it's kinda weird.

The local bar to me sucks ass. It's weird as it's super nice inside, but the executive staff or something sucks because it's always empty as shit, and understaffed. 


Sometimes I like to think about aliens. I check out a youtube channel about them, some stuff seems legit, some stuff seems silly. Who knows, eh?

I'm happy for Nintendo that their latest console and games are doing so well. It's nice to see ""good"" succeeding in this world. 

As for me, I'm losing hope in humanity and my own future. Maybe I should just go blow my head off with a shotgun and end this absurd twilightzone limbo hell I live in, but, no, I still kind of go on.

I guess that's enough venting for now. Yay. Have a nice night everyone.",20Mar2017,1
45,"Yeah, I get it. Get a new job. I'm looking far and wide for a job that actually gives a shit about their employees. 

I started a new program under a corporate client but I work for a different company. It started out as a 40 hour work week with Wednesday and Thursday off, eventually our schedules were pushed ahead one hour. It was like that for about two months until they suddenly decided to change everyone's schedule. Back then I set two doctor's appointments 2 months in advance on the days I would have been off on my previous schedule. The appointments were around the corner and I no longer have those days off. I informed my employer that I have those appointments on X day and he said that I would have to switch times with someone else willing to give up their day off, and I have to sacrifice my day off to be available for my appointment. I didn't want to take it because I have things to do on my days off. I offered to come in late and even make up the time lost, but the employer stated that if I do that, then it would count as a attendance penalty even if I informed him weeks in advance. At this point I was forced to reschedule my appointment to my day off and pleaded with the receptionist to not charge me a fee for changing the schedule. She gave me the appointment and told me to expect long wait times because the doctor is double booked. 

It's not the first time I had to deal with it either. I woke up with a horrible migraine and painkillers did nothing to help. We know it's customary to call your employer and let them know you're sick, which I did. I let the supervisor know I am sick and can't come to work, only to be told that if you don't show up, it's a double absence penalty. What the fuck? I'm too sick to get out of bed and I get written up if I don't show? That is massive bullshit. 


It's absolute bullshit. They clearly give no shits about their workers. It doesn't matter why you're late, it's a penalty counted against you. It doesn't matter if you're in the hospital, it's still a penalty. ",20Mar2017,14

47,"Ive enjoyed his show for years, but after that Destiny debate... Wow. I mean I knew he was on the right end of the spectrum and that's fine... But wow. He just comes off like an ignorant asshole.

49,"Throwaway account.

Been in a long distance relationship for almost 3 years now. We have plans to meet up on the 1st April. 

Her family is pretty religious, very prone to anger and the suchlike. It's not a nice environment and I want to get her out of there. Well, today her brother looked through her phone and saw, well. We're 19 and we're long distance and it's the 21st century. Go figure. 

He flew off the handle, snapped her phone in half and took her phone away.

I managed to get someone in her country to call the police because I hadn't heard from her for a while and she said that she was very worried about her brother. All I got back was that the phone was broken and the laptop was taken and that she didn't want to file a report because of concerns about the family being broken up and all of this. As the police saw no threat to her life, they left. Just throwing my opinion out there, think this is a dreadful idea. 

So now I have no way of contacting her, she might not be allowed out for a long time so I don't know when I will get to talk to her next, or even if I will get to see her for the time we've planned; I've already booked the tickets. If I don't speak to her I shall go to the airport and wait by the gate regardless. I do hope it'll all be okay. 

My favourite TV show is Dexter. Currently watching the British version of House of Cards for the second time (I'm eagerly waiting for the next season of the US version). I have school tomorrow where I only have two lessons not worth going in for so that sucks and then work at 18:00 I think. I'm hoping for an easy night. 

Oh, and my coursework is writing about nihilism &amp; misanthropy in literature. Good stuff.

Update: Posted this at 11-12 O'clock at night. It is now 10:14, GMT. I have finished my first essay and it's, in my opinion, fantastic. I keep a little pocket notebook that I've been writing things in to gift to my girlfriend and I wrote in it just now that it's ""the best essay I have ever written."" I'm really proud of it and I am sure she will be too. I just have one final critical analysis to write and then I am done. I'm getting my biology mock exam results back in 2~ hours. 

I still haven't heard anything back. I'm not as worried as I am as last night because I am sure she's safe, just without a phone. I said that I thought it was a bad decision to leave her alone, but I'm not in the police, I'm sure they know best. They deal with this all the time. I am hoping she will get a chance to get to her laptop or use someone else's in her flat complex to message me online somehow just to let me know how things are. I **really** hope that I am able to see her in.. 10 days? Beginning to worry that it might not be possible and it sort of makes me sick. But the main thing is that I am sure she's safe. Her brother is stupid, also. ",20Mar2017,19
50,"I'm 27 years old but I feel like I'm 20...hell people think I look around that age all the time. I'm struggling with my life. 

I was just broken up with the love of my life because I am not happy with myself and used her for happiness. I don't have a family or support system. I suffer from minor depression and I struggle with balancing school, work and rent. 

It's hard for me to be alone. I tend to think too much: mainly negatively and I think that I'm a piece of shit because I haven't succeeded by now. I'm smart. I know it. You can put me and almost any company and I can guarantee that I can perform well with a few weeks of training. I'm full of logic and reasoning. But I cannot logically reason with myself. In the back of my head is a voice saying that I suck and won't amount to anything. 

I really want to be happy and successful. I want to better myself and win back the most perfect woman in the world. What are the best steps for me to take?",20Mar2017,2
