0,"I'm hoping that I wasn't and the feeling I have towards it is simply regret for my decision, but my perception isnt 100% and would like another opinion. While still going through psychosis and also while high which made it worse, I lost my virginity to a woman 16 years older than me. There was something in me which didn't want to do it, wanted to say no, but I felt it was too late. I was afraid of hurting her feelings or pissing her off so I went with it. I did go there with the idea of sex and wanting to get it over with. Afterwards I felt nothing. It didn't even feel like I had sex, I felt dissociated from it. I just wanted to leave at that point but stayed for a bit to make it seem like I was ok. But I wasn't. Eventually we stopped talking and hanging out.  The next time I did it was with a married woman 3 times and didn't finish either time. I felt utter shame after the first time let alone the 3rd but it still didn't stop me. Now, months later, I haven't had sex since then but I've had the opportunity and I'm afraid to even initiate into intimacy let alone have sex. ive decided to focus on other things for a while",05Dec2017,4
1,"As I am now being asked what I want for Christmas, I then reply: I don't know. But if there really was something that I wanted but don't have, then I live in a utopia. But then that prompts the question: what does the world really need? A new shower curtain? iPhones with Animojis? Solving global poverty and war are good goals, but that can't be it, can it? Like, is there anything more than ending suffering? And I'm starting to think that there isn't, and that's a big problem.

Cavemen, when asked, will reply that happiness is a newly hunted cow appearing to them at their cave, pain-free and fear free. But now, in the 21st century, we can go to a warehouse and buy a meal for less than ten dollars. Those dollars, meanwhile, were most likely earned through an incredibly safe activity. As such, given the modern world's luxuries, we should be in a constant state of orgasmic pleasure. And yet, we're not.

Philosophers have struggled to define happiness, but that should not happen. After all, if one cannot define something, it does not exist in one's mind. Rather, what has happened is that people have a compelling feeling to do something until they have done it. Then, that feeling stops and cognitive dissonance rewrites the memory to add a feeling of happiness. As such, what most people call happiness is the temporary relaxation of pain, either from boredom or from desire. That's why most powerful painkillers cause addiction: it removes the pain of life, and that causes maximum happiness.

But this then raises the problem that the best way to remove pain is through death. As such, life is hell and death is heaven. And through suicide, everyone can go to heaven. Granted, **there's a 100% chance that everything that I said is wrong, so please don't kill yourself.** Desire can be pleasure, which is another thing entirely. Plus, even if what I say is right, then humanity can work to live with purpose. Also, [quantum immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_suicide_and_immortality) may mean that death is impossible. But that then begs the question: what do I do?",05Dec2017,2

3,"TL:DR Rear ended 2 miles from work on my starting day. Just moved to this city 2 days ago. 

Today was supposed to be my first day at Sweetwater. About 2 miles from work, I stopped at a red light and was rear-ended hard enough to destroy the front of my car on the truck in front of me. (The back of my car was surprisingly collected comparatively)

Needless to say, my day has been stressful. I guess I'll treat this like a journal and say that I'm proud of how I handled it. I didn't yell. I didn't swear. I was very calm. I've wanted to scream and curse all day, but I haven't. 

After sorting out the police report, I got dropped off at my new job by the police. I was promptly taken to the ER by my new manager. Needless to say, I feel incredibly blessed. And stressed. And I don't really have any friends here yet so I'm posting this on Reddit.

I moved to a new city, have a boyfriend who is ridiculous and makes me very angry sometimes. I ask him simple questions and he always makes a joke about whatever I've just said. He is nice though, and I like being around him. I like being with him, and he is easier to deal with than most people. However, I have no friends here. I don't really know if I want friends though, because when I go to speak to people, I don't want to hear about their lives. I don't want to be around them. I just get jealous of how happy my boyfriend seems to be when he is with his friends. I want to feel that kind of happiness. Lately I've decided to give up. I cry about it a lot, and end up having panic attacks and crawling into our closet when I think about it too much. I don't think I'll ever meet someone that I'm truly interested in being friends with who will accept me and reciprocate my feelings.

8,"I am in my 4th year of business school and I applied for the mentorship program at my university. Basically I got paired with a business professional who is the ""mentor"" and I am the ""mentee/protégé"" and we have meetings once a month.

I missed November's meeting because I had a mental breakdown in my professor's office, which involved talking to the associate dean, and then I got sent to a counsellor. There was no way I could have contacted my mentor because I didn't realize what was happening to me... After I calmed down, I followed up with an email apologizing that something unexpected happened and could not make it to the meeting. It's been a few days already and my mentor has yet to reply to me... I later emailed the director of the mentorship at my university and this is what they said to me:

*It is difficult through email to understand “ I was not in a condition to do so”? I would reach out one more time hoping to arrange another meeting and to explain why you were not in a position to cancel the meeting. Not communicating prior and having people go to a meeting place only to not have someone show up has probably damaged the relationship moving forward. You will have to keep trying but accept the consequences if she is unwilling to proceed.*

I don't know who else to ask for help/advice and I'm totally lost on what to do... I understand that I cannot just say ""sorry"" for missing a meeting especially since my mentor made time in her busy work schedule to meet with me. It basically just sounds like I wasted her time for not showing up. I don't want to mention that I've been going through some mental health problems, since I believe that is very personal. I also don't want to use my mental breakdown as an excuse for missing the meeting, but that's what it sounds like and I can't change the fact about that... Please help :(

10,"(This is a long post so I’m sorry)

So I wake up at 10am or so. Around 11, my wife Cat comes running into the room with this face that lets me know she's about to burst into tears. She tells me that a cat got hit by a car outside our place and ran to the bush next to the house, and that it looks like the cat's back legs are dead. My heart and stomach twist into a knot, and I jump out of bed and get dressed to see for myself.

As I leave the front door and approach the side of the house, I can hear this very loud-pitched, panicked meowing. And there she is. This skinny little Tabby cat, with its back legs twisted behind her, shaking from the cold, flinching every time she hears a vehicle go by. ""What a sweet kitty you are!"" I say as I crouch down to pet her little head. By the way, I'm holding this wooden crate lined with one of my sweaters, and Cat is not far behind with some food and water. I sit on the ground next to the cat, giving it all my love and comfort and reassurance but, in the back of my mind, not really knowing what its fate is gonna be.

Fearing for the worst, I have Cat call animal control, with the hope that someone could come get the cat, fix her up real good, and find a new home for her. Cat explains the situation to the dispatcher for a few seconds and listens intently for a few seconds before she bursts into tears. I take the phone and continue listening to what the dispatcher has to say. Apparently -- and I wasn't aware of this, because i've never been in this situation before -- all animal control can do is pick up the animal and then euthanize it, since the funds aren't in place that they can just fix every animal that comes through the door. While it makes me upset and damn near sick to hear that, I understand that it's more of an unfortunate reality than some evil philosophy on the part of animal control. I ask the dispatcher if she could recommend any places that won't kill the cat. She gives me a few numbers, I thank her, and I call around. Pet Pantry is one of the places. Helping Hands. LCSPCA. No answer, from any of them. I leave message after message, with no response. 

This goes on from 11:30 to about 1:45. In that time, Cat and I have some good crying sessions, because this situation is so heart-wrenching for both of us. Cat LOVES animals, and any of my friends who have dogs can attest to the unconditional love and compassion she has for any non-human creature. And me -- I never had pets growing up. But when I first moved in with Cat in 2012, she introduced me to what was now *our* cat, Fat Paulie. Bearing witness to the sheer amount of love and cuddles that could be contained within one 22-pound Tabby made me a cat lover for life. So, needless to say, we're both hurt.

And we're both hungry. With the cat safe and (mostly) sound -- and warm -- inside the house, I go into the kitchen and rummage through our stuff to look for a lunch I can make. Oh, hey, lentil soup, cool. I make us some lentil soup and we eat.

I have this habit. I have a Wikipedia app on my phone, so I have this tendency to read about the thing I'm eating while I'm eating them. I just like learning, and I'm all for any opportunity to inject some knowledge into my day. So while we're eating our lentil soup, I'm reading the article for lentil soup. This sentence jumps out at me:

""In Jewish tradition, lentil soup has been served at times of mourning; the roundness of the lentil represents a complete cycle of life.""

I read this out loud to Cat, and we both cry all over again.

It's 2pm. Still no response from the no-kill shelters. The sadness and panic we felt earlier in the day has now given way to a quiet, almost morbid sort of acceptance. Maybe it's for the best, I thought. The cat's in pain, so maybe putting it down is the best and most painless option. We did our best. At least the cat's final few hours were comfortable and quiet. I see in Cat's eyes that she's also attempted to come to a similar reconciliation. With a heavy heart, I call animal control back and explain that we've exhausted all our other options, I have to go to work soon, and could they please come pick up the cat. The dispatcher gives us a pickup time of 3pm, and I hang up, mentally and emotionally drained.

I start getting dressed for work, while I explain to Cat that they'll be here at 3 with a carrier, so make sure not to leave the crate outside. My heart aches with the thought that I'll be seeing this sweet kitty for the last time in both of our lives as I head out the door for work. I put on my shoes, kiss Cat goodbye, give the cat one last big ol' pet, shed a couple of tears, grab my keys, and head for the door.

Then my phone rings.

It's Pet Pantry. They're so sorry they missed my call, but the situation was explained to the vet, who agreed to take the cat in immediately. As I was listening to the woman on the phone, the cat lets out this big loud scream of a meow, which in that moment felt like the cat's realization that its life was saved at the literal last minute.

I make arrangements to get the cat to Pet Pantry and proudly call animal control back to cancel our pickup. I hug Cat with all my might and, with a lump still in my throat, hop in the car and go to work.

So, long story short, our new baby Lentil is safe and sound at Pet Pantry, and we can't wait to see her once she's all recovered. :)",05Dec2017,9
11,"Foreword: I consider myself someone who promotes equality for women in all places of society. 

Unless you have been living under a rock for the past month or two, you have heard of the hugely outrageous stories of men groping, raping, abusing, and harassing women in, around, and outside the workplace, among other areas with questioning levels of appropriateness. 

As a young man who's been in the workforce for a few years now and went through a very social college and fraternity life. There's blame to be set forth towards men who treat women like pieces of meat.

Men are to blame, but also women. This is obviously a statement that a whole book could be wrote about it but i'll try to summarize my thoughts.

**Society's Pressure**

So this isn't solely the fault of women, but just society as a whole (men and women). We have grown in the Cinderella era throughout America's history. The belief that a woman has to be pure to be most desirable as a life partner. This is a deep religious, Puritan influence in our culture and it persists today. Look a most Disney movies which portray the princess being saved by the knight in white armor. Even look at Roy Moore admitting to dating younger girls because they were 'pure'. Rappers rap about hooking up with younger women because they're 'pure' too. Men in real life date younger women because they're more 'pure'. 

So you have all this pressure for women to stay 'pure'. Meanwhile, any women which deviate from this get slut-shamed. Not only from men, but ferociously from other women. Look at any popular female-dominated TV show or movie and you're guaranteed to find examples of characters jokingly calling 'that bitch Becky a slut' because said Becky went on a date with the Subject's ex-boyfriend. It's a self-reinforcing pressure on women.

**Men's Hyperaggression**

So because women are pressured to act in a more reserved way to stay pure, men are tasked by society of being the ""approacher"", the ""aggressor"", or the ""man"". Look again at popular culture and history. ""He swept her off feet"". ""He made the 'move' at the bar"". The classic story of the man consistently pursuing the woman and wooing her over after constant rejection. The hard-to-get game that gets played.

All of this leads to men acting in ways that are hyper-aggressive and hyper-masculine. In college, we could go to parties with plenty of girls we knew or didn't know. Some we people weren't ever going to run into again, especially if we made an effort. Instead of girls and guys more equally pursuing each other mutually, flirting back and forth, men are kind of incentivized to do most of the seeking. Because if a guy is seeking sex or a relationship and he doesn't make a large effort, another guy will step in front or the woman won't make a move towards him without the guy's approach. This created an environment where guys in my college could walk up to a girl from behind, start dancing on her, and pull her hair back and attack her neck. Guys would aggressively pursue girls, trying to convince them to ""go up to their room for a drink"" or the other 100 creative ways to beat around the bush.

Those may be some more extreme examples, but it was so easy to take advantage of this as a decently outgoing, attractive, and aggressive guy. It's sad. I've traveled internationally a lot and and learned that other cultures don't have such a weird dynamic with men/women. A lot of anecdots I heard were women I met pursuing men openly and freely. I've got to known quite a few europeans, asians (lived in Asia), and latin americans, but I have not heard some extreme example of abuse or alcohol related incidents.

Humans react on incentives. The incentive for a man is the act aggressively towards women. The risk is rejection (ranging from 0 negative impact to loss of job, prision (rape)). The reward is power, sex, and love. There's much more rewards than risk so this is why you see so many guys with histories of aggressively hitting on women.

For a woman, there's more risk than reward in doing the pursuing.

**Summary**:

As a society, we need to encourage equality towards women in pursuing love and sex. When a woman feels she can be in control and in charge of finding a partner or a lover, men won't be trained to act in such hyper aggressive ways",05Dec2017,1

I have personal biases galore because I know of the folks involved so I can't really be impartial about what I think went down, but I'm kind of astounded about how it's going down.

Here's a gross over-simplification:
Person A accuses person B of rape. Lots of sympathy comments. Person B files a defamation case in court. Also says the posts on Facebook targeted his job. 

Now, Person C. Person C posts ""I always believe the accuser"" and links to this. Now, motherfucking Person C was accused of sexual harassment a few months ago (before the #metoo thing) and he came out against his accuser and had all these people saying she was in the wrong. WTF. It's totally pointless, but my god I want to say ""so, if you always believe the accuser, how about that time you were accused?""

Its about overcoming the ULTIMATE FEAR.

what is the ultimate fear you ask?  well its finally getting a girl to take you to her room and then you pull down your pants and she just starts laughing her ass off, shakes her head and says .. nope lmao i can't do this.  

Now this is every guys worst fear unless they are extremely comfortable with themselves or getting laid on a daily basis.  But, lets be honest those people are not the ones usually sending dick pics.

So, why do they do it when you made it clear that they don't want to sleep with them? ... well two hypothesis on this one.   Either 1.  They are giving up and realize that you will never sleep with them so they think you would be honest on weather or not it's a good pic or a laughable one.  OR 2.  They are super dillusional and actually think you might still sleep with them and they want to show you early to get the fear out of the way.

I also have ADHD and GAD which causes me to do a lot of stupid things. I was in therapy for it, but lately I haven't been able to afford therapy. There's plenty going on in my life but there always is. 

Now, I've gotten my ass chewed, and in the past when I was feeling emotional I cried it out in the bathroom and went back to work. To my knowledge, no one has ever had the slightest inkling that I've been crying at work at all, and it happens very rarely. Most of the time I can deal with all of it. 

But the last few days have been extremely hard on me. We are on overtime, I'm stressed about money (just had a 400+ car repair right before xmas and I have 5 kids to buy for, and that's just the tip of the iceberg).

Idk if my hormones are all out of whack or what, I know I bring up all the stuff that's going on but it's so frustrating to have been through so much worse, and to have something so minor tip the scales like that.

24,"Yeah, so I lost my job. It was at Costa coffee I hated it, it was a part time job and I had only been there for 3 months. I was eventually going to quit anyway, stay until I found another job but no. So that days we got the normal lunch rush, I was cashier. Then we got that one awkward customer. We always have these kind of people, at least once a day. They come in all moody, lacking manners and find something to complain about. If you've worked in customer service, you know the people I mean.  

Well I overheard this guy complaining further down the queue to the other girls. Something about having his food toasted. Peeping over, I made eye contact and he just scowled at me. 

And then he came to the till. I gave him his coffee, said we would bring his food over and told him the price. 

He looked at me in displeasure and said ""what?"" 

So I repeated everything I said, and he just blatantly says ""what are you, ****ing Polish or something?""

I just reply ""no, please can you pay?"" because I had no idea what else to say (I'm actually German, I've been living in the uk for 5 years, most people understand me fine too)

Well, he replies ""what? I can't understand you!"" and to which one of the other girls jump in to repeat what I said. And he loses it. 

He goes off on a rant, most I can't remember, but this guy starts raising his voice at us, everybody is looking while having their lunch and he starts ranting about foreigners to us, using me as an example and saying that it's my fault he can't understand me, and then he goes on to about politics and immigration and keeps raising his voice to the point that he's actually shouting, all the while he kept leaning in closer over the counter to try and get in our faces, we had to step back. 

One of the older barista girls tried to speak to him, but he ignored her and a lady also tried speaking to him, he didn't stop. 

When he took a moment to breath, I said ""how about you **** off now?""  This time he understood me, no problem and he just stared me down in shock. Silence didn't last long though, because he burst out again demanding to see the manager and crying ""how dare you speak to me like that?!"" with a few insults, swears and racial slurs thrown in this time. 

One of the girls dragged me by the arm to the staff room, the supervisors were informed and tried to calm the situation. While waiting in the staff room, I could still hear him going at it. It went on for another 15 minutes or so, and the police had to be called. 

Later that afternoon, when everything had calmed down, I had to have a meeting with the supervisor. I felt fine, thinking he'd just ask me how I was and such, but he started to talk down to me and stating that it was my fault. He wasn't even facing me when he was saying this. He spoke to me from behind, but at this point I didn't care, I told him I'm quitting and that was my final day.

Arnold’s answer: https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7hkj4i/my_friend_was_taking_a_picture_in_la_when_this/dqs02ow/

I am posting this in /r/self as a description of events and as a question at the end, as I have been banned from /r/pics. Here’s what actually happened to my best knowledge:

A friend of mine, Mikko, was visiting LA. He went to Venice Beach to take some photos of the murals. He was about to take a photo of a mural of Arnold, when the guy himself appears (out of nowhere, from my friend’s point of view) in a tuxedo.  It seemed to my friend that Arnold just walked in, basically. He has a few people with him, someone with a camera. My friend has no idea who these people are.

My friend is taking a picture of this mural when Schwarzenegger says to my friend: ”Do you mind?” or something similar, indicating that he knows he is ending up also in my friend’s camera’s view.

Arnold then starts posing. In a frame that my friend would have taken anyway. Thus, he felt that Arnold kind of photobombed his picture. Which was one of the coolest things in his life. 

This lasted for about 1 minute. Arnold then jumped into his car and drove away.

My friend was dumbfounded. He did not know (before today) that the few people with Arnold were actually GQ crew, as from his point of view Arnold might have an entorage with him in general, and one of them taking a pic of him as he does something funny. He also heard that Arnold would have some kind of an office nearby. That was his best guess of why Arnold was in the area.

Me and my my friend Mikko both live in Finland. Today, we woke up to Arnold – /u/govSchwarzenegger – himself having explained the situation in the original thread during the Finnish night. Now, people are saying that I was lying in the original post for karma. My inbox has a bunch of ”you lying cunt” messages, and hundreds of people are laughing about Arnold busting my silly lie.

As you might guess from having read the above, to lie was not my intention. I knew this might blow up and any bullshit would not fly.

In hindsight, I definitely should have chosen my words better and especially give more information. Still, I was operating with good intentions and with the information I had. (I also mistakenly thought that Mikko had never posted this pic anywhere. That’s why I put in [OC] in the title. It turns out the pic has been online before, just not in any kind of serious circulation.)

Hope this clears things up! I have not been able to post this explanation in the original thread as I was non-conveniently banned for 3 days from /r/pics for having a ”misleading title” while I was sleeping.

Wanted to share just because feels a bit bad to be labeled a liar in the eyes of the community you love.

28,"Are you depressed, or perhaps even suicidal? Do you have a demon glued to your back who whispers of a way to stop the pain and hurting, of a terminal option? Is it all too much to bear and you just want it to end? Of course there’s good stuff, but there’s just plain and simple too much of the bad?

Then I say do it. **Kill yourself** (but finish reading first please).



What I have just suggested is highly controversial, surely suicide is not the answer, no matter how bad things may appear to be. Sure life can punch you in the nutter or the nanny sometimes but is that really grounds to killing yourself? I mean there’s no way of coming back that we know of, right? So what I am saying only applies if things have become so utterly unbearable that you see no other way, see no hope that there could ever be another way but death, and every living moment is torment. If that describes your situation, it might be time to do it. To finally kill yourself.

But not your physical self. That would be a waste. You have a perfectly functional body and there is no reason to harm it. End your life as you know it. Cut ties. Remove what doesn’t fit. Sever your identity and make a blank slate. Envision every single aspect of your personality and then peel them off, layer after layer, until nothing remains. That’s when you’re ready to die an ego death and become part of everything.

All you have to do now is to pass on. To let go of your life as you knew it, and to let nature take its course. And when that new life returns to the blank canvas that is your body, who knows, it may very well be better than the last version.

And that’s what I think about suicide.

33,"I see a lot of people saying that the first step towards building self confidence and becoming less self conscious is to realize is to stop “giving a fuck” about what people think. However, this does not come easy for some. It’s very difficult to simply turn one part of my brain off.

34,"Where the fuck do I even begin? It feels like everyone I know in my age group that I've kept up with is doing so much better with their lives than me. I went to a great school, I have friends in law school, doing consulting and making good money, even one who's pumping out articles for Glixel like it's nothing, and I can't even get a job that pays more than this shitty temporary one, or finish my stupid fucking novel that no one will ever care about.

I don't even know where to start. No career path sounds even remotely appealing to me, unless I magically get a job writing for an actual factual publication. I applied for a fellowship at ClickHole a month ago, but they didn't even bother to get back to me, despite them saying they'd've done it by Friday. I know rejection is routine in the writing field, but for fuck's sake, why is nothing taking? I love to make people laugh. I do it every day. I'm always watching something funny to relax. I'm not good enough to make anyone think, but I'm not good enough for this, either, apparently.

My parents, who I still live with (lord kill me now) keep pushing me to do advertising or public relations, and I don't fucking want to. I hate ads. Why would I want to write them? And why would I want to make a living out of defending terrible people and miserable business practices? The only thing I could think to do would be Edelman's trust barometer, but I'm pretty sure that requires a degree in public policy, which I definitely don't have.

I wish I had a real passion for anything. My parents saw me take up something small when I was little, and pushed me into it, even when I wasn't interested anymore, like the violin. I was always into writing, but I can't even fucking come up with pitches for magazines because I don't fucking care enough about anything to want to do that constantly, or have an opinion with any weight. I would hate to turn music into work, and I love fashion, and while it's a practical art form, it's fucking shallow. The clothes don't actually *do* anything, and people who can do the most with are basically all trust fund kids.

I don't want to work at a shitty, boring, soul-sucking job. I don't want to be poor. I know I shouldn't complain, but for fuck's sake. It's like running for president. You just have to magically know what to do and how to do it.

This post is a mess, I know, but I'm perpetually exhausted and angry at the world. I don't even sleep well anymore. My skills are suffering because I can't come home and practice because I'm tired. I'm not self-starter. I hate it. I hate hate hate hate it, and have no idea where to start changing it.

35,"I can't stand the cynicism and self-righteousness on Reddit and I think it negatively affects its users' mental health.

Let me start by saying I love interest-specific subs because they get me information and discussion in a way that no other platform can. r/nfl, r/indieheads, r/fitness are all staples in my morning routine and keep me interested and informed.

However, I believe the community as a whole is toxic, self-defeating and petty. The number of good subs like the ones I listed above is dwarfed by shitting-on-things subs, like justneckbeardthings, _____InAction, creepyPMs, any of the cringe subs, OopsDidntMeanTo, pussypassdenied, quityourbullshit, or any of the other subs that allow people to focus on others' flaws for the sole purpose of jerking each other off. It's pathetic and doesn't promote a positive mental state in those partaking. Even subs like CrappyDesign exist to find flaws in the world.

I think it's why people worship Bojack Horseman and Rick Sanchez on this site - people feel inherently superior but unappreciated without addressing their own underlying flaws. Why not focus on positives in other people and don't spend time on things that make you unhappy?

As a final point, I've probably met maybe three overbearing stereotypical SJW types in my life and I was able to avoid seeing them on a regular basis soon after I realized we disagreed. But on this site people dive DEEP into their hatred and comb the Internet for every extreme example. What's the damn point?

I don't know what the purpose of me posting this is, but I just hate seeing self-defeating attitudes when there are so many cool things to spend your time on instead. r/wholesomememes can get a little overbearing at times, but at least it has a good message.

Thanks for reading.",05Dec2017,8
36,"My mom's been an alcoholic for about 10 years now. I don't know if she's one of those types that's so dependent that she'll die without alcohol, but it does control her life. She cancels her appointments and has ruined vacations because she finds the alcohol.


For the past several months, every Monday has been her ""relaxation day."" Basically she starts drinking first thing in the morning and stays in bed all day doing nothing but drinking, sleeping, and playing on her iPad. 24 hours of hard drinks such as pure vodka, or vodka mixed with bourbon and wine. Basically just anything with alcohol is fine. I think it's pretty gross.


Well today is different because it's leaking over into Tuesday. She cancelled an important appointment for her car and an exercise class. Ironically, my mom is a health nut despite being a hardcore alcoholic. I asked what she's doing in bed and she could barely speak (as usual) ""stranger things"" is all I heard. I knew she was drinking but she said she wasn't even though a glass of bourbon was right next to her.


At this point I don't know what to do. I'm thoroughly convinced that I'm going to lose my mom within the next couple years. I tell her to go to the doctor and at least get checked to see how her liver is doing but she's refused for so long and I believe she actively tries to hide it from him.


Going for 2 days straight has to be very serious, isn't it? I just don't know what I can do anymore besides watch her destroy her life. My dad doesn't like it but I think he's an enabler and I'm convinced at this point that my mom might actually choose alcohol over her family.


TL;DR: Is this moving into dangerous territory? I don't know what to do anymore.",05Dec2017,6

41,"Most of the sites I frequent on the internet are free. As everyone loves to say, that means I'm the product. Facebook, Reddit, Youtube -- these are the sites on which I spend most of my time on the internet. I *know* that when I visit these sites, my behavior is being monitored to a level of detail I might not even imagine. I'm also aware of the fact that all of the information that can possibly be squeezed out of my usage and attention is being packaged and sold to the highest bidder. This means targeted ads, changes to the content I'm shown, sometimes emails and calls from services/companies I haven't solicited (any more consequences of my data being farmed that I should know about?). 

As of now, this hasn't been a problem for me, but I'm assuming at some point it will -- one day these sites, which are either directly or indirectly acting as a persuasion architecture, will try and succeed in persuading me to do something I didn't really want to do. As Zeynep Tufekci says, ""either Facebook is a multi-billion dollar scam, and it doesn't work as a persuasion architecture, or the systems they've built are of great concern.""

What I'm struggling with is how to juggle what I know about these companies and the way they work with how to live my best life on the internet. I do not want my data being sold to the highest bidder -- at this point, data about my facebook or reddit usage could provide a company (or just a private party) with enormous power over me. However, I know I get a lot of value out of these sites. Facebook allows me to keep in touch with people I wouldn't be able to keep up with otherwise; Reddit gives me a way to organize the way I take in the internet, and connect/converse with people all around the world, with vastly different views than mine. Youtube has provided me with endless entertainment.

However, none of them could exist if they were not free. No one would begin using Youtube if it was a subscription service -- it would have never built a user/creator base, and would have never grown in to the company it is today. Same goes for Facebook and Reddit. If they started charging for the use of the service, people would switch to the free alternative.

So, what does this mean for the future. Is this just a Faustian bargain I have to choose a side on. Do I have to make the choice that the benefits of these online spaces are outweighed by the detriments to my peace of mind and privacy? Does the future just hold more and more obscurement of the *real* way in which these companies make money, and further and further exploitation of myself through the hoarding/selling of my data?

45,"Back in February of 15, I dropped out of college. It was a master cosmetology course, and I was doing exceptionally well. However, the stress of the workload, some social blunders, strain on my marriage, and poorly managed mental illness, made me have to stop. The program had gone to the Bronner Brothers Hair Show (basically a trade convention) in Atlanta a few days before it happened. I had a decent time, but I wasn’t truly enjoying myself. 

On the long ride back home, I reflected on the trip, and how I hadn’t really cared about anyone or anything who was there (save for my one or two friends in the class and the nail care/art portion). I texted/called my mom and told her that I don’t want to do this anymore. She told me that it was too late to change my mind, as I’d come so far and was almost finished. This isn’t what I needed to hear, and about an hour away from home, I decided that I’d go and shoot my self in the forehead. 

My phone was nearly dead, but I was able to call my husband and tell him what was happening. He agreed to meet me at the school and follow me home. The phone died about twenty minutes away from the campus. Once we got there, I quickly gathered all of my things and got into my car. I parked near the main road so I could see when my husband would get there. 

Ten minutes passed. I was annoyed. Twenty passed, and I got worried. After thirty minutes went by and he still hadn’t showed, I had convinced myself that he was in such a rush to get to me that he wrecked his car and was dead on the side of the road. I had the second worst panic attack of my life at that point. Screaming, ugly-crying, spit and snot, tearing at my hair, the works. I was eventually able to calm down enough to decide to drive home, charge my phone, and call him. 

On the way home, I changed my mind and went to my mother in laws place to use her phone. I arrived and called Husband. He was also in a panic and told me he was waiting for me. (This was my mistake; the school has several campuses, we left for the trip from the main campus, he thought I was at the smaller one where my classes are.) He sped over, and once he was there, I called my mom and spoke loudly enough for Husband and his mom to hear. I told her/them that I was quitting. No class is worth me putting a bullet through my brain. And that was the end of the discussion. 

I went to class a day or two later and told the department head, my instructors, and my fellow students who cared enough to listen exactly why I was leaving. They all understood and were very supportive. 

The following year was the worst of my life, and I considered offing myself more than once. I considered myself a failure who wasn’t deserving of all the things I had. 

Well, two years later, I returned to school (this time solely for nails). I just finished my written final and scored an 81%. I scored a 90% on the practical final and I have a high 90 in the class as a whole. I feel amazing, like a complete 180 from where I was when I had to drop out. 

And I sincerely wish that there was a way for me to let past collexor know that it’ll be okay and everything will work out. Hell, there are several past collexors I wish I could visit. 

I’m so thankful for everybody’s love and support and I wish that I could share it with myself, back when I needed it most. ",05Dec2017,1
46,"So this last few months has been pretty terrible. I’ve found myself reaching out for help using many different avenues and resources...one of which was Craigslist. I posted my story in their general community section...I talked about losing my mom, losing a Baby etc. I get a response from a Larry Laugher (not his real name) asking for proof that I’m a real person so that he could donate. I give him my Facebook info etc and he responds saying that if I took pictures of myself and recorded 5 videos of me doing things he would pay me $800. I should of known better posting there but I’m still a little shocked and offended. The sad part is I thought about doing it for a split second out of sheer desperation but decided I wouldn’t be able to live with myself. I replied and said no thank you and he replied saying I didn’t have to show my face! What is wrong with some people? ",05Dec2017,2
47,"My father died over a year ago. He was a funeral director, but had no plans in the event of his death. An obnoxious three wheeled ""slingshot"" was parked in front of the funeral home where he lived and worked. He kept this purchase a secret, though everyone at the funeral was in on the joke but me. 

I wrote the eulogy in swift, sweeping generalizations. He was great. He was there. Everything was perfect. When we die, all of the million little cuts bleed into scarlet red remembrance. Was the pain the point? Should I have told you about the abuse?

At your funeral, the dog you loved nosed her way into the bedroom and ransacked my backpack. Only moments before I stood before your family and peers and gave my parting thoughts on your (un)timely demise. I wrote them the way I write everything. Hastily. Unprepared. 

You taught me that. 


But you also taught me things that weren't part of your global parenting gameplan, I assume. Or maybe you had no plan. I would think that a funeral director without a living will is like a fireman without fire insurance. You knew the risks. 

The dog you loved died the night we gathered around your plastic, confused corpse. Rock bottom used to be so low, but now I am looking up. 

I am seeing a counselor now. He asks a lot of questions. He has zero answers, which is par for the course. 

The bank repossessed your three-wheeled joy ride. My sister and I got our fair share, which wasn't much. It never will be. 

Your dog ransacked my backpack and rooted through all of my coping mechanisms. Your shaggy dog tattered a photo of all of us on a beach, somewhere, in 1982. Your loyal companion chewed through a V-Neck that I wore weekly for almost a year. Your mutt stared into my eyes blankly after they devoured my prescription of THC-infused edibles. I had been using this therapy to deal with you. In the end, I spit out your eulogy and bounded up the steps to the funeral home ""apartment."" 

I didn't take the dog to the vet. I went to sleep that night snuggled up close to the child you never met, your grandson, and woke to the news that your pet had a heart attack. I wanted to cry but I was dry. 

Here I was, only eight hours prior, staring at three animals who had destroyed my overnight bag. An empty tin of THC-infused espresso chocolates sit near the foot of the couch. All of your dogs stared at me as if I was on trial for their curiosity. I plead the fifth. We skipped opening arguments.

48,"Just recently, I was watching the video of John Oliver attacking Dustin Hoffman for allegedly sexual assaulting a women.

I notice in every case of these accusations, the accuser is instantly believed and the defendant in always presumed to be guilty.
I don't get it. Shouldn't people be innocent until proven guilty? Shouldn't people be tried in a court of justice instead of a court of public opinion. Shouldn't there be any criminal proceedings?

I feel people like John Oliver are just trying to exert their holier than thou status so they win more popularity but it is absolutely unfair that we can destroy people's reputation and lives without any actual evidence or without any attempt to sympathize with the accused.

John Oliver even says that ""she has no reason to lie"". WTF? Unless, you've enumerated every single possible reason why she would lie, you can't even make a statement this bold. Believing people this blindly is ridiculous. There IS a non-zero percentage of women who lie, therefore we shouldn't just blindly accept accusations.",05Dec2017,0
