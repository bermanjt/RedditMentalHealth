2,"I was walking along the river and saw a fish about 1.5 ft long, sideways in a small and very shallow tributary-like finger of water. The water wasn't flowing there a that time. I figured it was dead but then I saw ripples around it. Took me a minute to verify that it wasn't just water moving against the fish. There were better streams of water near that he couldn't get to - essentially land-locked in his water - and the river was a bit further away. 

So I ran up to the boat rental place and explained the situation to the guy there and he lent me a net. I ran back down to the fish and carefully walked out to where I could get him - the mud was really slick. 

I netted the poor sideways fish, and he started flopping around, a good sign. Quickly, and without falling on my ass in the mud, I got to a creek going to the river that was about 20 feet away. As soon as I put him in there he swam off. Felt good.

Later I was walking along the canal along the river and came upon a great blue heron standing there. They usually fly off if you get too near. I made plenty of noise to let him or her know I was there but the bird didn't fly off.

That made me concerned that maybe he was guarding a nest - all the ducks and canadian geese here have their young following them around right now.  And the heron was a big bird. He must have been 3 feet tall and quite bulky. I couldn't easily get around him because of the flora along the river but I didn't want to get to close because BEAK.

So I whistled a little and that definitely got his attention, his neck extended and he looked around, which kind of puzzled me because I was purposely making plenty of noise before hand, yet maybe he didn't hear me.

Anyway I got within maybe 5 feet of the Heron? - I like birdwatching but I've never been that close to one - and I put my hands up in the human gesture of 'hey I don't want to fight' but I was also thinking I didn't want to be beaked in the skull... He let me walk by and then flew off. 

So all in all an interesting few hours with the local wildlife. And I saved a fish.",11May2017,5

7,"So there's this girl at work. We've been pretty good friends since we met and trained together, but she had a boyfriend, so I just saw it as a total work restricted platonic friendship. I did start to develop feelings for her though I suppose as time has went on. Things seem to be kind of changing though and I'm starting to wonder if she feels the same way. I want to know if she's just trying to be friendly or if she definitely seems interested in me. I've listed all the stuff she's done that makes me think she might be:

 - A while after we started I noticed she's get all excited whenever she seen me start work. She still had a boyfriend at this point so I thought nothing of it, but she did tell me that she considers me to be like her best friend in work and she always feels much better when she sees my name on the plan.

- She always seems to know shit I'm pretty sure I've never told her, which makes me think she's been doing a little bit of social media stalking. For instance, she knew my favourite soccer team (which we have in common) and the names of the guys I'm friends with, things I'm pretty sure I never talked about with her. To add to this, I caught her accidentally liking one of my old Twitter posts before.

- She refused to go to our work's night out unless I went with her, which I put down mostly to us being 2 of the 'new people' at the time, but it's still something I suppose.

- One time another female coworker and I went to grab something at the same time and accidentally held hands for a second. She laughed and said 'You need to control yourself when you're around me!' I laughed and jokingly shot back that I was sorry but I couldn't help it. Straight after that little joke though I noticed the girl I like looking kind of weird about it all. Not annoyed, or like jealous, it was like she was just trying not to watch and look somewhere else or whatever. Things were fine straight after though, and again, she had a boyfriend, so didn't think too much into it.

- After she split up with her boyfriend is where things get weird. She started messaging me outside of work after they split up, and at the time I wasn't sure if they had broke up or not, but I eventually had it confirmed by her. The fact that she started messaging me shortly after cant just be a coincidence, although I suppose she could have been messaging multiple people.

- I bumped into her at a party, where her ex boyfriend was also attending. She stopped me and said hi to me, gave me a hug, and we talked about how the party was kind of shit. She told me it was worse for her cause he was here. I kinda didn't know what to say, but she just said its not worth thinking about, grabbed my hand, and told me she was gonna drag me up to dance. I told her I wasn't nearly drunk enough to think I could dance well, but I kinda wish I just did it.

- Later that night she messaged me about where I went after the party and she was telling me how she still feels kinda shit. I just told her its best not to worry and that breaks ups are just shit in general, and just tried to joke about other stuff, and she went on to reply saying something like  'Thanks so much, I love you' I just replied back half jokingly saying 'love you too' and told her to get some sleep and she'd feel better when she wasn't drunk, and while I've kind of half jokingly told girls I love them before, this kind of seemed more meaningful in a way. This all happened like a month or two ago.

- I'm going to the same party as her this weekend, and she made sure to ask if I'm going and told me she's planning on getting extremely drunk cause she's not working the next day. The thing is I never told her I even know the host, so she's obviously done a bit of digging to find that one out.

- She also always tries to like arrange things with me. Like for instance she's going to the same college as me after summer, and suggested we start travelling together in the morning and stuff.

**TL;DR:** Work with girl who had a boyfriend. We became good friends, and I started to crush on her a little. She split up with him and now various things have happened between us that make me think she might be into me too. Am I reading too much into her friendliness or is there a chance here?

21,"Tonight, my girlfriend went out to the bar with her graduating class as a senior bar crawl. I DD'd and picked her up late at night and took her back to my place. She was drunk and pretty upset about how one of her good guy friends was macking on her at the bar even though he knew she had a boyfriend of four years (me).

I have seen her upset-drunk a good amount of times in the past, so I knew she probably just needs to sleep it off; the chances that she even remembers it in the morning are pretty slim. After she's at my place for like an hour, she's doing her normal extremely drunk thing. She is on the ground, just wearing underwear, head on her knees, going ""oh man"" now and then. I am on my bed.

At some point, she asks me ""Oh man, did I throw up?"" to which I say, ""Yeah, you threw up a little bit ago in the toilet."" Then she apologizes and heads to the bathroom in my room and turns on the shower. I get out of bed and try to intercept her because I think a shower is a bad idea for her right now consider how drunk she is.

However, when I get up, I see what she thought was ""throw up"". It is a massive, messy shit. Like a softball's worth of excrement and not all in a solid log or anything. And it is all over her feet and legs as well, so she tracked it more on my carpet and into my bathroom. I say, ""uhh that's not throw up dude"". 

I am shocked. I have no idea how to handle this. While I initially thought it was a little humorous, I then realized it was up to fucking me to clean this poop. I go to the shower, check her status, dump some soap in her hands and instruct her to clean her feet thoroughly. It is covering her toes.

The smell is starting to hit me. This is 100% poop. I run to the kitchen to grab some grocery store bags, a trash bag, and a roll of paper towels. I start by cleaning and bleaching the tracked poop in my bathroom as this is the easiest and most intuitive. It's not so much either. Like what would be an eight-wiper if it was on your butt cheeks.

Then I turn to the poop pile on my carpet. Fuck. I move out of this place in like four days. My parents will be here as well for graduation tomorrow. Fuck. There's my girlfriend's poop on the floor.

I start to get a little angry at my gf now. How did she get pants-shittingly drunk? I feel like that is extremely irresponsible to do in the first place. When I first picked her up, I knew she was pretty drunk, but this is just insane now. I have a little worry for her now. I check her status in the shower and she seems clean enough, but definitely completely fucked up. I turn off the shower, give her my crappiest towel and tell her to start drying herself off. I really do not think that the gravity of her duece has hit her yet.

I start googling how to get poop of carpets. They all say some combination of vinegar+water+soap. I check the kitchen. Balsamic. Rice. Apple. No white vinegar. I gather up the biggest clumps with the grocery bags like you would a dog poop. Now it's just the stuff down in the carpet.  It's 3:30am at this point. The grocery store opens at 7am. I am going to wait until then to act more deliberately on the poop pile. I need that vinegar and also some gloves would be nice. It's a lot of poop here.

I don't even know what to say to my girlfriend about all this. We joke about poop and farting and things of this nature, so I thought I would react pretty calmly. But guys, it's so much poop. I am angry at her for doing this to me, though another part of me knows it's not truly her fault since she was so wasted. But another part of me is mad that she allowed herself to get this pants-shittingly drunk and leave me to deal with the consequences. I don't even know how to begin to have this conversation tomorrow morning. A part of me doesn't even want to talk to her right now. I don't know what to do on a physical shit cleaning level, much less the emotional backdrop. My gf is currently passed out in my bed. I am not sure how much of any of this she will remember. I don't know what to do. 

EDIT: **UPDATE:** Well after about 11 hours of sleeping, she woke up and I was ready to tell her the news. I asked her how much she remembered from last night, and just like I thought, she didn't remember much of anything after leaving the bar. That's when I was like ""okay, yeah that's what I thought... Well you kinda had an... accident last night. You shit all over my carpet."" Then I gave her the run down of what I pretty much told you guys. As any decent person would be, she was mortified and apologized profusely. I had kinda gotten over it at this point, so I told her that it wasn't really that big of a deal and to not worry about it. I had already cleaned it up. I just asked if she could notice the stain or smell when she looked at the scene of the crime, and she said she couldn't see or smell much of anything from the incriminating excrement. 

Then we just laughed it off and she told me that she really owed me one and that she appreciated me taking care of her. I asked if she could send me $9 to cover the cleaning supplies and she said of course. And then we laughed like it would be a funny story in a few years. All said and done, not a terrible end to a poopy situation. Thanks everyone for the supportive words and sensibility in what was a weird night of my life. ",11May2017,570

30,"I was raised in a time where sexism was socially acceptable. I was raised to believe that I cant talk about my feelings because that's not what men do. I was told I had to treat women with respect because that's what men do. I was told that to be a gentleman I had to have money, that the only way you'll succeed in life, the only way you'll reach your goals is to be able to provide a sense of security for yourself and the woman you're with. I'm 25 and I have been working hard to change my entire mentality on what it is to be a man and how to date in a world that critiques everything. I open doors for people, but if I am seen opening a door for a woman, I'm now subconsciously saying that she can't open her own doors, or that she needs a man to open up a door for her. As a kid, my grandfather taught me to buy flowers for a date, but now that's just seen as weird or creepy. What are they going to do with the flowers? Hold on to them for the entire date? It's not practical. I cant open car doors anymore because she'll arrive in her own car. It would be so weird if I just tried to open her driver's side door to let her into her own car. 
My biggest issue is that I still have the mindset of a 90's gentleman. I still view women as separate human beings and I feel the urge to be a knight in shinning armor, but I also have the views of a 2017 feminist and I can't express any of the values I grew up with because they no longer apply to the society that's grown around me. How do you change that? The perfect man of my time (of my childhood) now no longer has a place. I'm at a loss and I just want to feel like I fit in. Instead, I live my life in silence because of the fear to express my thoughts and have them seen as offensive or oppressive. I feel like everyone else was able to transition just fine, but I'm still here, stuck.

31,"Last night, when I was in my home studio coming up with ideas, reading about musicians/bands(specifically King Tubby, William Bennett, Stephen Stapleton(a huge influence on my music), Dean Blunt(another huge influence), The Sugarcubes, Siouxsie and the Banshees, &amp; The Creatures) and thinking about today(how my post was removed from bpt and why I even posted oc there in the first place) and how it relates to my career.

I posted some of my tweets on bpt(against the rules, I know) because I was proud of the tweets and was saddened by how I almost never get recognition for my tweets or my music on twitter.

Which brings us to another subject.

A few weeks ago, I had become familiar with Harsh Noise Movement and his label/cohorts due to finding out about him through r/noisecomps, where I contribute. I followed him and some of his cohorts on twitter and checked out some of their music, etc etc. 

One day, a few days(or weeks, not sure) later, after having been restless about my next release following my last album and tweeting about it a bit, I figured remixing a Gimp Gash song(a musical/sound art project from a woman who's married to HNM or whatever. she followed me back at the time btw) would be a cool idea. 

I'd found a song of hers that I liked, I wanted to show some respect and appreciation for one of my contemporaries, I was curious to see what I could do, it would drum up interest for my next album or EP, and it would build up credibility/interest/esteem among my contemporaries. 

So, I tweeted a y/n poll asking, ""Should i remix a Gimp Gash song?""
So, of course she sees it.

Presumably trying to be funny at this point(I'm not exactly sure and whether or not I care depends entirely on what day you ask me), she quote tweets it, saying something to the effect of, ""I don't think Gimp Gash would mind. :)"" 

Her fuckass husband(which of course is HNM but I honestly don't feel like it's worth acknowledging him as a fellow artist) responds to her with, ""Who's that tosser?"" then, ""I voted no because he's obviously taking the piss.""

He's middle-aged, by the way. He has a bit of a history of being very dismissive towards younger artists and mocking them on twitter, and I don't doubt that it's because he's somewhat popular and fancies himself a big shot because he got Merzbow and Jamie Saft to send him a track for one of his compilations, which is probably because they felt sorry for him or something.

She says, ""hmmm, not sure who this person is ^^(lol ^^okay) or why they'd want to remix a gg track ^^(are ^^you ^^really?)""

Then fella says, ""I'd ignore the wanker."" (Keep in mind, these people literally still had me tagged. Also this guy was literally talking about me, a teenager(trying to make something of himself no less) like this.)

She responds, ""Ah, well, you're probably right. A bit annoying when folks throw out your name just to throw it out. ^^(*seriously?*) Do they think I'm going to suck them off? That's what Beth did, and what happened to Beth? BETH, YOU THERE? THAT YOUR REAL NAME? lol"" ^^(*How* ^^is ^^this ^^even ^^being ^^said ^^by ^^a ^^real ^^human ^^being?)

I was honestly incensed that these people would talk about me like this over something like that, but I decided to hold my tongue for the moment being because the comp fella was putting together(and I was on) wasn't out yet.

Like what the fuck possesses someone to want to tear someone who's creating things similar to what they create(and who wants to be their contemporary and possibly follow in their footsteps) down like that?

It honestly hurts that I can't even try to network and augment my name in the niche scene I work in without having to deal with that *still.*

Which brings me back to the original subject: being uplifted and promoted by people of your kind.

Black people like to say this and that about how they promote and uplift black excellence, but I find that sentiment incredibly difficult to agree with, considering that artists like Dean Blunt aren't *nearly* as recognized and acclaimed within the black community as they should be. I'm barely recognized by the black community for my many attempts at humor(barring rare moments on Reddit) and I haven't gotten any recognition from the black community for my music *at all.*

How am I supposed to believe ""my/our people"" care about experimenters like me, Dean Blunt, Michael LaCour, Stefan Burnett, or the frontman of Dälek(I forget his name) when we barely get any attention from ""our people,"" if any?

This question's been bothering me a lot, which is why it's gonna be a big part of my next release. I've already written nearly half of it already this evening. This is urgent and very personal to me, and I really hope it speaks to people when it comes out.

Sorry if this was a bit difficult to read; I had a lot on my mind and didn't pay much attention to organization.",11May2017,1

Anyways, there's this coworker I've known for about a year, used to sit next to before switching departments and have hung out with before in non-work group settings.

She texts me asking if I had seen Guardians of the Galaxy 2 yet, and since neither of us have we setup a time to see it (last night). Now remember, I've known her for a year, we've hung out and I have a general understanding she's just into movies so I'm not thinking anything of it.

Well, I get to the movies first and grab the tickets. She walks in and immediately the alarm bells start ringing. She's wearing a dress and her hair is done and she has some powerful perfume on. Like clearly she tried and put effort in, this isn't her normal everyday outfit to the office. She thanks me for grabbing the tickets and says she'll get the food. 

We go into the movie and and sit down and she asks if I've seen the first one. Yea of course! But she tells me she hasn't and there it is, suspicions confirmed, this isn't about the movie. The whole time she's squirming and mentions she's cold and clearly wants me to make a move that I have no intentions of doing. 

The movie finally ends (super good by the way, I'd recommend it) and before I can escape she just grabs my hand and is like you have to try this bubble tea place next door, cmon! I'm thinking to myself there's game 7s to watch I gotta get back home but next thing I know we're sitting having tea and conversation. Like I've said I've known her for a while so the conversation comes easy but my lack of interest is clearly not getting across.

Eventually we leave, she gives me a hug and hops in her car. I get home still slightly shocked and before I get to bed I receive a text saying she had a great time but wishing I had made a move at the movies. Now this girl is super nice and everything but if you're not into it you're not into it, what can I say? I told her I had a good time as well but I needed to be upfront and that I was expecting to just enjoy the movie as friends and that I was sorry but not really looking for a relationship right now. She texts back sounding kinda pissed I didn't tell her before the movie. (Let's come back to this).

BUT! Here's the kicker! This morning she texts me asking if I'd like to go bowling...like I ignored her advances, tried to avoid showing intimate interest and even straight up said I'm not into it. Thankfully I'm in a decently big office in a locked room but for me this seems to be turning from ""I'm really sorry but I'm not that into you"", to ""WTF do I do now!?""

And you tell me, should I have seen this coming from a mile away? Like I don't think it's crazy that I wasn't aware I was being asked out. Having said that, I'm also can't come up with a solid way she could have asked me so I had clearly known.

Also, I said I'm not into it and although we've hung out in groups before it's not all that often. So for her to come out swinging again first thing this morning after being rejected, well what's even the proper response to that?!

TL;DR Coworker wants to see a movie, turns out coworker wants to see it as more than friends to my surprise, even after rejection she is still trying to make something out of it.

The event happened on March 15th at around midnight. I am living in a very remote location in the South of Chile, helping out with a reforestation project in a natural reserve. I usually take out Rex (my dog) for a walk at night when I get home. We go for long walks in the woods behind my cabin, which im fairly familiar with. The night felt a little strange, the weather was really cold, and very cloudy so it was unusually dark. 20 mins into the woods I see a strange light above the canopy of the trees. I thought it was an unusually bright star but the light began moving. I got a little worried so I decided to head back. I notice that the light is following us and getting closer and bigger. The light was a very powerful white, almost blinding. Rex started barking at it and suddenly went quite and completely still. I stopped dead in my tracks, completely terrified. I began to panic. I wanted to run but I couldn't. The best way I can describe the feeling is almost as sleep paralisys. I could hear, smell, even sense the coldness on my skin but I could not move nor talk. I was completely blinded by the light. I could not see anything but white. I still felt the leash in my hand and could feel it pulling. I began to panic and cry. I could feel the tears going down my face but I still could not move. Suddenly, the light begans flashing red and white at an extremely fast rate. I felt dizzy and got an intense headache. I felt my body moving, kind of like when your in a car, you feel the kinetic energy but your body isn't moving. I could still only see red and white light flashing before me. Suddenly everything stopped. The light dissapeared and I felt a push on my chest which knocked me on the ground. My body ached, like if I had been running a marathon. I was exhausted. I sit up on the ground trying to digest everything that just happened and I noticed that Rex was gone. He was not on his leash. In my confusion and fear, I got up and began running back to my cabin thinking my dog had done the same. He wasn't there. To this day, I have looked everywhere. I've walked the trail again, I've used my truck to get up hills and see if I can hear or see anything but he vanished. Whatever the light was, they took him. Even thinking of everything that happened makes me dizzy and I begin to weep like a baby. I can't take the mental torture. I will end this today.

44,"Hello. Sorry for my language, please, it's not my native and nowhere to practice, unfortunately. I'll try my best, but there certainly would be many mistakes. Ironically, in the real life I am also have problems - but with Russian, my mother tongue, because of moderate to severe speech disorder (can't pronounce many sounds).
I am 29 years old male, born and raised in Ufa, it's one of the biggest cities in Russia, but moved to Cambodia at the beginning of 2008. So long here already... I moved to this country because it's extremely cheap in comparison with Russia, food, accommodation, everything. Always summer, tropical climate. Some fine beaches. And very easy to get and prolong long-term visas. I have no good education, didn't finished even my high school and go ""free"" a few months before high school graduation. I have no specific interests or ideas about what to learn, so simply no motivation then and now. No ideas about areas of study, etc. I have never worked a day, a hour, a minute in my life. Nowhere and never. Next year I will be 30, but all my life I was and I am now totally, 100% dependent on financial help from my parents. Before I moved to Cambodia, I was living with them in one apartment, currently they are sending me not much, but enough money to live every six months via Western Union. Without remittances from my parent in Ufa, I would have no money to pay for food, for little room that I am renting. I would have money for nothing. They love me, so they would do this as long as they can. Even after sanctions and there was reduction in Russian salaries few years ago, no matter for them, they're still doing this. I don't know what to do. I never worked, I have no experience at all, I have no education, and I don't know what to do, there are no such thing as my ""area of interest""... But even if there was, I am already 29 and my family not rich enough to add education payments to their spending on me, and I am not smart enough and young enough to be offered education free of charge. Anyways. That's all. So complicated. So unsolvable. I'm totally confused. Maybe, there are some perspectives in future for me, but I simply don't see them. Some evenings I am drinking local moonshine, some other ones crying alone. Don't know, what to do. Maybe, you know... How can I help myself? Are there actually ways I CAN help myself. Doubt it, doubt in future. ",11May2017,2
45,"Hey everyone!

This is Kerry, and after the drama of the past couple of days, I wanted to clear a few things up.

First off, let’s address my notebook. No matter what I say in regards to this, I know that people aren’t going to believe me. That is just the nature of the internet. But I will say it one more time anyways.

The story wasn’t mine.

Now, what you all have done has been less than kind. If we could just drop the subject now, I would appreciate it. Regardless of what the truth is - I am sure far more juicy stories are out there for you to sink your teeth into. 

Secondly, I would like to talk about the ritual and the girl at my school. I will just say it flat out - I have come to realize that what I tried to do was wrong. Hurting people isn’t the answer. She is mean, bigoted, and undeniably a bully - but what I tried to do would have made me no better than she is. So from now on, I am going to try and learn how to bring good into the world instead.

One other thing about that - I picked up the flu from someone, and ended up getting really sick right after that night. Between feeling ill and knowing that all I would find on the internet was mockery, I just didn’t feel like getting on. That’s all that happened in regards to my absence. 

Thirdly - there have been some frankly vile things being said about me and my father. Before this, I was totally unaware of the other meaning that some people have for the word ‘Daddy’...so that was a rather traumatizing experience. I want to make this perfectly clear - my father and I are very close, but not like that. He would never abuse me in a such a way. My dad raised me by himself, and he is an amazing father who is pretty much my entire family. So please, just don’t talk about him like that. It’s sickening. 

I am still very interested in the occult, and I hope that all of you can move past my previous actions and help me to learn. 

All in all, I have learned a lot the past couple of days. About myself and about others. I hope that I am a better person for it, and I am looking forward to learning more about all this stuff. I definitely won’t be trying to work with any demons until I am more knowledgeable, that’s for sure!
