4,"I've become somewhat of a monkish person these past 2 months after absolutely destroying a relationship. Looking back at it all it was as if I was stuck on auto-pilot and the manual operations were entirely disengaged. 

Some men will never claim to have had the woman of their dreams; at the very least I can claim to have had mine, if only for a short period of time. I feel sorry she had to endure that period of time with me. 

I understand that moving on is necessary, and any feeling of unfinished business or closure is just a disguised attempt at reconnection. I know I'm a mess and I need to clean myself up. I began by quitting smoking, drinking, all my vices. Started working out again, meditating and taking happiness seriously - probably for my first time ever. I was lost in myself and I feel like I broke through and am observing my past actions like an outside observer. It's been interesting learning about myself, getting to truly meet myself, facing my inner turmoil and trying to stop blaming my upbringing for my shitty outlook on life.

 I'm on a good path toward self discovery. I'm getting better, even if just slowly. I just can't help but hope she's doing well and that she's happy. Nobody involved would believe me, and that breaks my heart, but her and her kids will always feel like family, she will always feel like the one I was ""meant"" to die next to. On one hand I hope I forget her face.. On the other hand I'd rather sleep alone every night if that only meant I could always remember it.

Anyway. Good lord. This is weird typing all this. I just needed to spill out some thought aftet a workout. I've been so close to calling her, so typing this is getting that out of my system.

Here's to being a better man.. Happy 4/20.",21Apr2017,5

6,"I'm graduating college this semester and have to go out into the world where it will beat up my ego.  I didn't have much of an ego until past the year and now I feel like I have this self entitlement, like the world owes me, like I owe myself a good life.  I want to travel, I like going out and hanging out with people.  I also like playing video games and writing music.  I owe myself things: to make an album and to write a poetry book I know no matter what happens with my life, those things will happen.

My problem is that I've grown an ego and any little thing that pokes at my ego, I nudge away from and isolate myself.  How do I get rid of this?  This self entitlement, getting rid of the thought that the world owes me, like I owe myself?  People may snap at me but I know they're just having a bad day and my interpretation of the situation can be so.....sensitive.  Should I make myself less sensitive to the world?

I meditate, but some things just....poke me hard.  I think what kills is I got a parking ticket on Tuesday so the rest of the week I had to walk to school (in the rain for one day) then someone I really care about snapped at me because they were tired after I got them food.  They did say thank you, but I just stormed out, saying I'm going for a walk, and I am but I'm hanging out in some baseball dug out.  That all isn't what kills, what kills is I feel this pain, and the pain is real, but I know my problems are so minor compared to others.

I just want to fix everything, fix myself, fix the problems of the world.  I just want to make things ok.  I want to be able to handle things that would make me cry even if it's just words from people I love.  I just want to be ok with shit that happens in life and I think it begins with my ego, my self entitlement, the I.O.U. from myself and the world.  How do I get rid of this?  It's fucking up my life...",21Apr2017,5

17,"I have had depression since i was very young. I suspect i am a manic depressive. I also have OCD and anxiety if that adds anything. I am a jealous, manic, easily upset, very sensitive man and I don't know how much that is related to my mental disorders but i suspect a lot.

These issues have harmed all my past relationships unrepairablely. I think i may have just lost my next chance for love for good.
Her name is kayla. I love her with every fiber of my being but apparently not enough for me not to make a huge deal out of everything and start arguments no matter how many chances she gives me. She said she is done. There is no ""working on it"" until i work on myself. She says we should just work on even being friends for now. Problem is i do love her and she does love me. We've had many problems in the past but have mostly been stuff we tackled. If i was a smarter man they would have all been settled by now anyways instead of being put on the back burner and causing problems later.

I was a good boyfriend conventionally but god was i a whiney shitty person to be around and i am not mad at her even though she has her own faults. who am i to judge when i fucked things up. The pain when she said to me "" I'm going to bed. you ruined another night"" shakes me to my core.
I wish there was someone i could be held by but there isn't. I hit the wall so hard i fractured my hand. I've texted my parents back home (I'm in college) that i need some serious help but i honestly believe its too late. I will fight to get her back and fight for my sanity but i think most everything i love is too far gone to grasp again and I just want to cry but i cant.

I don't know why but i needed to post this. I don't know if my irritable erratic behavior is even depression or if i am a legitimately terrible person. I just need to talk.

What should I do now? 

I'm feeling kinda lost. 

Should I attend community collage and try to get perfect grades and transfer to Cal? 

That would be almost ideal, if I could pull it off, I think. 

Should I go for a guaranteed transfer to another UC? 

Seems like the reasonable option. 

Should I return to UCR? 

If my parents would allow it, I could get an off campus apartment and take UCR classes via the extension center. 

It would be good because I've already friends and obligations there and it would be good not to abandon that. 

It would also be good because I really would rather not live at home. 

On the other hand, I never really liked UCR. 

Should I attend some other university? 

I have no idea. 

Should I take a summer internship or seminar or something in the liberty movement? 

It would be fun, and a nice change. 

Perhaps that's what I need, change. 

Still, it isn't something I really want to pursue, and I have other reservations. 

Should I put off doing anything and instead focus on addressing my mental health issues? 

Mental health is important, and I can't do much else without it, but treatment doesn't seem promising.

He had a long answer about how it's full of metaphors and references and felt satisfied with himself, but then I revealed that the song had been made by a simple neural network which had never been programmed to include any meaning into the song, and it's basically a simple pattern generator. He seemed sad. Their assignment now is to make any form of procedural generation to output something useful, I am interested in what he would do with it.

26,"...as a 22 year old Arts (Digital Media) graduate. Admittedly the path that got me to graduation - last year - was based on what I did in high school &amp; [a second chance](https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/382ycx/think_ive_wasted_2_years_at_uni_not_really_going/). Too bad the only jobs I could find myself are pizza delivery &amp; unloading shipping containers. Both piss easy casual stuff getting me a few hundred a week. I don't have a ""dream job"" in mind - heck, my dream job at this stage is simply working within the digital media field *somewhere* but even internships are a pain in the arse to find. I don't know what to make of my only ""internship,"" of a couple of months, where the only thing was unsuccessfully running a Twitter account.

Weirdly I don't have any *specific* life goals right now - just be happy &amp; and one day being able to live independently. And while it's a way off obviously (saving to replace the crappy car I have/even just a service) it's doing my head in that this ""gulf"" is stretching as I'm only just making some progress.

I might sound like I only 100% care about my career, although that's because I'm slowly shutting myself off from any of my parents judgement. My social life is at a crossroads; I don't know whether to start fresh or try and beat the dead horse from my existing acquaintances (most of them from high school/work/wherever I met them) who haven't really given me anything so far. It might be an issue of letting go, but I'm a deer in the headlights with strangers, but with my ""established maybes"" I barely get anything from them. In their defence I had *no idea* how to have a social life as a teenager. I only went out a handful of times socially in high school.

At least my health is decent. Physically I'm in the best shape in years, and mentally - it's a constant battle - there's been an increase of days where I feel competent &amp; clear rather than zilch &amp; zombie-like.

31,"Many people know how this goes; you fall in love, you breakup, your ex now seems a lot happier than you, you feel like crap. I suppose that pretty much sums what's going on now, but for some pretty specific reasons. I suppose this is a continuation of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/64lsw3/exgirlfriend_disappeared_after_i_discovered_a/) post, which I never expected to get as much attention as it did, nor did I expect so much support. 


The **TL;DR** of it goes like this: Woman and I date, we seemingly love each other, I come down with a bump on the brain (we discovered a mass), I become a shitty wreck, she fades on me, 4 years go by from the last I talked to her (5 years from when I'd seen her), she needs a place to stay, I provide that, she leaves, here I am.


As I typed the previous thread, I still felt quite shocked. As you can imagine, she meant quite a lot to me, and we didn't break up on mutual terms...or really in a conventional sense ---- she just sorta faded. After seeing her again, I felt a sense of closure, and it felt like a huge weight was lifted...at first. After which, I couldn't help but bring out the baggage; every little way I felt at the time of our breakup. 


This includes: that all-encompassing fear of death thanks to the brain mass; I could literally feel the pressure pushing down on me all over again; heartbreak from what seemed like her being completely over me, while I dwelled for years ---- even saying that things got better for a little while after me and that she's interested in dating someone else (after splitting from her last boyfriend); perhaps one of the biggest here is how fucking scary it is that I didn't realize just how long 4-5 years was.


After the news of the brain mass and my girlfriend leaving, I became a mess of depression. Looking back, I’d essentially entered a time warp or a coma-like auto-pilot. I cringe at the shit I said/did in that time, or even thinking about the people that I spoke to. It was a rough time of desperate attempts at feeling wanted and not wanting to be alone. Daily, I thought about suicide ---- not wanting to deal with “what if” scenarios in my head in case this mass turned out to be something horrible, and the invasive thoughts of my ex enjoying another man’s company. 
You know what? I have no idea why that still bothers me. I think it’s because I hadn’t accepted in my head that it’s been *that* long, so hearing her new romantic endeavors makes me feel kind of cruddy even if being with her again is completely out of the question. 


The irony now is that I’m dwelling about my years of dwelling. I don’t really have many people to talk to about this sort of thing, and turning to Reddit sometimes feels like the only option to vent. Things will probably be alright eventually, I just want this to all be behind me, so it can just be closure already.

33,"so, my boyfriend of 5 months recently broke up with me, i've been having a mental breakdown today since i'm supposed to be seeing him today (we have a dog we share together). basically, just the stress of the breakup has made me realize a lot of things about myself.

i'm currently 21, 22 this year, and feel like such a failure. i just switched my degree from fine arts to psychology, because i realized that after spending 30,000 for art school, it wasn't my passion anymore. i realized my passion is mental health and i want to help those with the same illness as me.

i spent two years in vancouver (i'm from regina) at art school. i wasted a 20,000 line of credit in a year because i was irresponsible with my money and did not budget. i was in a long term relationship and my ex used me for money and sex. he abused me mentally and emotionally and made my anxiety/depression blow out of proportion. this was a year ago.

one reason why i feel so sick and tired of myself is because i wanted to do so many things by now. i had a dream of being an young artist early and not needing to worry about money - i was a dumb teenager. i had so many dreams that i couldn't live out because well, life is cruel and money revolves around everything. i have been jobless since september and can't seem to successfully land a job after about 10 interviews in the last few months. i feel like this is what lead to my breakup - just the stress of money and him losing his shop and not being able to have a steady income - that just lead to him exploding and dumping me over nothing.

i hate asking my parents for money more than anything. i want to be able to live on my own, afford my own dogs, and just be happy by myself. i want this to be right now, but i know that's not possible, because i have 3 years left of school (currently a 3rd year, have to get my phd) and am surviving off student loans.

the one thing that makes me feel good is working out, but on my rest days, i feel worthless because i'm not at the gym sweating out my stress and frustrations. today is a rest day.

44,"I could write pages on this, but I will try to keep it as short as I can.  My boss is one of those types who coasts and does as little as possible, and depends on people underneath him to do the work.  I work in a restaurant and I am the assistant GM, my boss is the GM. 

Since he took over sales have declined and he has no vision or plan of where he wants the restaurant to go.  He is very, very easily distracted, and he has no ability to follow up on a plan.  He will ask you to do something one day and then never ever ask you about it again.  

I don't expect the GM to do the work necessary to make operations run smoothly (like food orders, etc.).  Instead a GM needs to make sure everyone else is doing their jobs and he needs a plan for how he's going to grow the business.  My boss does neither.  Instead, he comes to work, spends a lot of time texting, and just wasting time watching youtube videos, and joking around with the staff.  He lacks organization and he's terrible with time management.  One day he spent 30 minutes trying to figure out which server (out of a pair of them) had been there longer.  

I'm the guy who runs the operations and makes sure things like schedules, inventory, food and liquor orders, office supplies, and everything else related to operations is getting done.   I feel like I'm being taken advantage of because my boss doesn't do any of that work and yet his name is on the front of the building and he takes the credit when there's credit to be taken.

I've heard him in interviews telling prospective applicants that he doesn't do any of the work himself, he just takes the credit.  Although it's nice for him to say stuff like this and acknowledge me and my co-manager, it's frustrating because he *knows* that he's not doing any work and yet he does nothing to fix it. 

It would be one thing if he didn't know he has a problem, but he indeed knows that he's not organized, easily distracted, and bad at time management, but *he does nothing to mitigate the problems.*

Just now I was looking for him and he was walking around in the parking lot eating popcorn.  On a Friday night.  Instead of doing table visits and chatting with guests, he was walking around outside eating popcorn.  On a Friday night.

There's so many more points to this story I could include, but here's a few bullet points:

* His wife didn't speak to him for 6 months even though they lived an otherwise normal life. He then found out she was cheating on him.
*  He spied on her and tracked her car and recorded her liaisons with her boyfriend, but never spoke with a lawyer.
* When he confronted her, she told him, ""I'm not going to apologize for the affair, I enjoyed every minute of it."" He forgave her and  **didn't place any conditions on her**
* remaining in the relationship.  She didn't even have to apologize for her actions.
* He fears her spying on him so he [takes his computer to his car every night and locks it up](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/5xep6y/my_boss_locks_up_his_new_computer_in_his_car/).
* He paid his wife $50 for sex because she didn't want to have sex and he did.  He said, ""I came out ahead on that deal, I would do that every time because I come out ahead by doing that."" Clearly having sex is more important than his own dignity.
* His son punched a kid at school and got suspended and my boss said, ""I don't know what's going on with my son lately"". *Really?!?* I don't know, maybe the kid is upset because he thinks his parents are getting divorced so he acted out at school.  This is the most un-self-aware thing my boss has ever said.
* His wife told him that she isn't in love with her ""boyfriend"", but that she loves having sex with him and she thinks about having sex with him all the time.  My boss said, ""That's good, right?""
* He wanted to get one of his friends to go to a bar where his wife's boyfriend sings karaoke every week and get into a fight with him and kick his ass.
* He stalked his wife's boyfriend in person and on facebook.  He went to the guys workplace and waited on him for over 2 hours, not knowing whether he was working or not, hoping to confront him.  He did this 3 times.
* When that didn't work, he stalked him on facebook with the intent to send pictures to his wife's boyfriend's friends and family to try and shame him.  He never went through with it. 
* My boss is not a leader, he does not inspire you to greater things.  You do not get out of bed each day saying, ""I can't wait to go to work and impress [my boss] with my work ethic today.""  He very rarely says thank you or even acknowledges the work you do. When you have your evaluation he lets you know.
* He rarely invests in people.  His idea of a pay raise for hourly employees is 50 cents and you have to ask a couple of times to get that.  You basically have to be the best employee of all time to get $1/ hour raise. 
* A girl was suspected of doing heroin in the bathroom at work and when confronted she said she had snorted a valium and he didn't fire her.  Now all the employees think they can do anything they want and not get fired. 

I walked into the office today and he was texting someone and he immediately put down his phone and walked out of the office to go and ""do some work"".  Clearly he knows he's not doing his job or he wouldn't have put down his phone.  Things like this happen all the time.

I've lost almost all respect for my boss and it's affecting our relationship.  He keeps asking me every day if I'm ""alright"".  A couple of days ago he asked me if I was looking for another job.  I have been tempted to look for one, but I like my job, I just want my boss to do *his* job.  I know I  could do his job and part of me is upset because I'm not being acknowledged for the work I'm doing.  My boss doesn't really use any oversight.  I could sit down and spend an hour on a crossword puzzle and he wouldn't say anything.  He gives you free reign and doesn't break your balls if you're not spending 100% of your time on work.  

I'm worried if I got another job that I wouldn't have this ""freedom"" and that I would be micro-managed much more.  I don't think my boss will ever change.  So i continually ask myself if I can stomach this about my boss or if I should look elsewhere for a job.  

If you've gotten this far, thank you for reading.  I needed to vent.  What in the world would you do in my situation?  Have you ever lost all respect for your boss?  What did you do about it?  What would you do if you were me?",21Apr2017,2
