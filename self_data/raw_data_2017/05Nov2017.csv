But more along the lines of I was good enough to get my highschool art teachers attention and they talked around their colleagues and they all told me my work would take me far if I kept at it.

But growing up has made my passion of art go sour and my hair falling out. But I want to regain that passion... and possibly regrow my hair but I don't know where I would begin!

I need some advice on getting some materials. Nothing that'll break the bank (least not for now) but something that'll lead me towards a good path ya know?",05Nov2017,2
1,"Details changed for obvious reasons.

I started this job a few months ago which is the most soul sucking thing. My work is meaningless and I'm doing nothing to better the world. Frankly, I can't even tell how my company manages to stay in business (which it has for a 100 years). I spend most of my time on my own without my supervisor checking up on me, and talk to almost no people until I clock out. The pay is pretty good though.

So I spend most of my time sitting around playing on my phone at my desk.

Then, a few days ago, my boss told me that I've been doing really well and that they're considering me for a promotion and a relocation to an office in an area I've told him I loved.

I'm frankly just really confused.",05Nov2017,52
6,"A lot of my interaction with my friends is done online in games like over watch, and more recently destiny 2. So when one person is on at the same time as me, I’ll invite them to play, and **usually** we’ll play for a while. But if any of my other friends comes online, I’m chucked to the side like nothing.

It might sound small, but I haven’t played competitive over watch with any of my friends since season 3, because the “leader” of one of the friend groups I’m in that primarily plays OW, stared spreading stuff about how I throw all the time back in season 2 (when I first got OW on PC), and I just went along with it because I didn’t think it would be a serious thing. And when he started saying this stuff I wasn’t (and still am not) the kind of person to throw. I just wasn’t doing well in a game and made a  passing joke like “aw I’m throwing”, and he latched on to it.

Sorry if this is hard to follow I’m just upset because just now I was playing with one of my friends when he added the “leader” to the group and he started saying like I wasn’t even there to kick me from the server and go play over watch with him. It really hurt :(",05Nov2017,2
7,"I just never really cared much. Same with friends and a social life, occasionally meeting someone is alright but most of my time I'd rather spend alone on things I enjoy.

This changed a bit half a year ago. Suddenly I feel like I'm missing out big time and I ask myself how it's possible that I didn't care before, even felt and still feel a bit depressed about it. I'm still a virgin at 22, I'm a bit embarassed about that fact, but most importantly I just want to know what it's like to love someone and for her to love me back. I also hope to get a more active social life too, I've found a couple of groups and activities on campus which could be fun and that I want to check out and maybe meet new people there. Apart from that I want to be more outgoing in general.

Maybe it was because I'm a fat guy and thought I didn't have any chances anyway so why bother worrying about it. At least I'm losing weight now, even if it's for a very selfish reason. 

So ... am I just weird for not having cared about it for all these years?",05Nov2017,1

10,"I don't have any expectations, but I'm utterly desperate. I need help, but I don't know where to turn for it.

I don't really know where to start, so I'll get to the point; I'm suicidal. I've got a plan, though I'm not sure I have the guts to go through with it. While I recognize that I shouldn't feel like I have nothing to live for, I feel that way anyway...and being suicidal isn't even why I'm desperate enough to ~~make a rambling post~~ beg for help on reddit.

I've felt worthless for a while now, but I've finally managed to push everyone in my life away. I can't keep a job. I've turned to marijuana and other substances to try to cope with life. I only did so after years of attempting antidepressant after antidepressant, adjusting dosages and constantly ~~trying~~ failing to find a way to be able to be a normal, productive, semi-happy human being.

Not surprisingly, my girlfriend has finally let me know that she would be leaving me soon (we live together currently). Sadly, I have to admit she made the right decision. If I couldn't get my shit together in order to help her achieve her dreams and goals, then I am a lost cause. And this is where I will ask, beg, plead, and cry for your help. I know I have lost her, and I'm sure she will be better off without me, but I do not want her to continue to suffer for staying with me for so long while I was a complete failure and unable to support either of us while she went to school (as was the plan when she moved in with me about a year ago).

There have been numerous times I strongly considered checking myself into a mental hospital for suicidal ideation. I haven't done so for numerous reasons--the primary one being that nothing in my experience has led me to believe it would be helpful. Another reason was the financial burden of not being able to make money while I'm stuck in a hospital trying to get well (which probably didn't matter since I can't seem to keep a job anyway).

Please help me to get her back to where she was financially before she made the mistake of moving in with me. She's maxed out several credit cards and taken student loan debt that she wouldn't have if she had not been trying to support us both while I was essentially a worthless, lazy bum. If the people of reddit can help her, then I will choose the best recommendation from reddit on how to get help for myself and follow through with it.

Please, please help.

*Edit: Woke up this morning and had the displeasure of finding out what it would be like to wake up into a nightmare that won't ever end. I have never felt anything like this, and it's clear to me at least that I'm at the end of my rope. I bashed my head into a very solid wall several times. I wonder if I have a concussion, though I guess it doesn't matter. Checking this post afterward confirmed I'm out of options. Even my last ditch effort to reach out to reddit and literally beg received one reply that wasn't helpful at all. I'm a failure even at begging. Oh, well.",05Nov2017,6

But right now it seems like none of that happened. I feel the same way I felt right after the guy took my phone, plus, I feel lonely, and there's no way to talk to anyone (hearing their voices) because my ""new"" phone doesn't have a number. Now I'm left with nothing but watching Netflix and overeating to do.",05Nov2017,1

16,"I don’t know where else to post this. I’ll delete it if this isn’t the right place. 

Anyway, I’m a mixture of sad, anxious, mad, and apathetic right now. 

Today at work was extremely busy and somewhat stressful, and made worse by the fact that I partially tore someone’s Touch ID on their iPad. (I work in a repair shop.) which almost ended up costing my boss $900 to buy then a new one. 

My girlfriend went to a party tonight. I don’t care for parties but she’s her own person and she can have fun. Well, it turns out there are some harder drugs at this party which makes me slightly uncomfortable but it’s not my place to tell her what to do. Then I get a random phone call from a friend that’s at the same party and he tells me that she’s apparently hanging out with some random dude alone. This makes me super uncomfortable because:

1. She’s been drinking
2. They’re alone. 
3. I don’t fucking know this dude. 

But, I’m not going to freak out on her. I’m of the ideology that if she’s going to cheat on me, then she’s going to do it whether I try to prevent it or not. I just try to make her happy and show her how much she means to me and that’s all I can do. It still hurts to think about. I’ve had a sinking feeling in my gut that she’s going to leave me or cheat on me because I’m about to go into the Air Force and she will sometimes get sad and talk about how she doesn’t know if she’ll be able to make it through my BMT with me being away and not able to contact her. (I know there are phone calls and letters that you can write in BMT, but that doesn’t seems to be fucking helping. 

My truck is fucked off currently. The starter went out this morning, So I was like 45 minutes late to work. Then, I have to drop $160 of money I need for fucking bills and to pay back someone who’s truck I accidentally backed into so that it doesn’t go onto my insurance (the dude is amazing, being very helpful with that situation. Mr. Davis, thanks man. You’re the bee’s knees.)

THEN as I finished with my truck and go to start it, i very quickly realize that there’s a short in the starter wires and the started kept spinning even though the truck had already started. (Rest in pieces flexplate) and now I have to wait until tomorrow to spend more fucking money to get some more stuff to fix the truck and hope to god it’s still drivable

Oh and then then the cops show up at the party, which stressed me out and gave me a spike of anxiety because I didn’t know if she was going to get taken home or given a ticket or what.

I don’t know. I needed to vent and I don’t really have anyone to talk to. I feel like shit. I’ve been dealing with stuff from my abusive mom, depression because I just got back into a good relationship with my dad (which my mom had fucked up to begin with) and now I’m leaving for 4 years because life doesn’t stop moving for anyone. 

Sorry. Just wanted to get this off my chest. ",05Nov2017,53
17,"This year my goal for myself was to be a better person. I have done everything on myself to achieve it, but most important thing was to remove people who are double faced or the one who hinder my overall growth. I tried and thought of doing many things &amp; they were not successful. at the end I thought that I have to work on this goal 'betterment of myself' for next year too.

Just a month &amp; 2 weeks before my birthday I realized that the one who really matter to me and vice versa will remember it without any kind of notification so I removed my birth date from every social media platform. And I have started seeing results. only 3 weeks are left, and no one has yet done the countdown or posted good things and memories I have with them on Facebook Instagram snapchat. Like they used to do before. So that means the filter is working and I may achieve my goal for this year.

His best friend shot himself 3 years ago. And he had financial issues that caused him to pause college studies for a year. But he's always prioritizing me, asking about my day even though I rarely ask about his via chat, getting me to hang out with his friends and little brother even though it gets him into trouble with his parents because he is still a student who should be focusing on his studies. I never ask about his best friend. It might not be my place

I'd always been awkward and thought of myself as the /r/foreveralone type, but I guess I'm not. I'm just extremely surprised that there's still hope that I won't end up alone and that I might be worth being in a relationship with someone.",05Nov2017,9
22,"Wow...I have to apologize in advance as I am sure a lot of thoughts are going to spill out here...My feelings now may be symptoms of a lifelong problem so maybe it is necessary to post some background info. 

I grew up in a broken home- my parents divorced while I was still a baby. Dad was an immigrant from a very impoverished country but after he left us, he started to do really well for himself, started another family- unfortunately at this point he didn't seem to want to see us much (his children from his first marriage), or maybe was just too busy. Mom was mostly the sole caretaker, but had a lot of problems with various mental illnesses, hoarding, was a substance abuser, various toxic relationships etc. I spent a lot of time isolated, had a very small circle of friends, and lived with a lot of shame and secrets.

Fast forward to the college years: I chose to take up a grueling study program, (that I am definitely not passionate about), and commute from my mom's house to classes, because even though I knew it would suck, I just didn't have the money to afford living in a dorm. BUT, at least I knew my future profession would be very marketable pretty much anywhere in the world. Ultimately, I hoped that if i made the sacrifice then, I would be able to leave my mom's place more quickly (in the long-term) and never be stuck there again. As expected, the college years were absolutely grueling. I decided that in order to push myself out of my misery, I would save some money from work and backpack Europe for a month. I finally did it, and the trip was one of the best times in my life. At age 20, I partied for the first time, I made friends, and I met a local guy from a Scandinvian country. When I got back home, we decided to pursue a long distance relationship. Over the next two years, I powered through the rest of my studies, and after graduating with my bachelor's (1.5 years ago), I moved to join him in the Scandinavian country.

In the Scandinavian country, I could not work in my own profession until I was able to speak the local language with near fluency- so I took the only job I could which was as an au pair- but unfortunately it was just like being a maid, chef, cleaner, and babysitter...The treatment from my boss became psychologically damaging, and I started to wonder if I made the right life decision. Again, fearing having to return home to my mom's place, and not wanting to leave my then-fiance, I decided to push through and I can officially say I have left this job as of two months ago, shortly before I got married in a small ceremony.

So, here is my current situation: I am not allowed to work for half a year, (which is the rule for my new visa), but I am still studying the local language at an intensive level for the next 2-3 months until I take an exam in it. Simultaneously I am studying for a major exam in my profession(like the Bar exam but relevant to my own area of study). Passing both of these exams should allow me to finally find relevant work in this country. My husband is a master's student and working part-time. On top of this he gets a check from the government every month for being a student, so our personal budget is really, really tight but we are able to live off of this. We live in a tiny studio apartment and eat whatever are the cheapest foods we can find (potatoes, rice, beans, whatever vegetables we can afford).

My husband and I seem to have an increasingly apparent disconnect, in that he has always had a happy and stable life. Healthy family life, kind of wealthy, lived and traveled in many countries around the world, studies something he really enjoys... The culture where I come from, and that my parents also instilled in me, is that it's normal to be miserable and hopefully someday life will thank you if you work hard. Here, the culture emphasizes that work should be enjoyable and always balanced with leisure and hobbies. (Because I am not established in this country yet, I do not really get to live by this principle.) I have a difficult time making friends, and I don't have time for hobbies with my current study schedule. My husband does not struggle at his job, or with his study life. He socializes with his classmates and co-workers, gets invited to parties or out for drinks or free pancake events (just as an example), while I study at home. I eat potatoes and rice at home while his work offers gourmet sandwiches from one of the country's most famous caterers every day, with cakes delivered and candy available every Friday. If it weren't for him having to think about me, I bet he would absolutely love it.

Even though I am jealous of my husband and feel guilty for being dependent on him, I don't like to say it because, let's face it- if it weren't for me depending on him financially, his life would probably be even better. He sympathizes with me and many times has said ""I know this situation is not fair to you"", but of course I can't tell him he shouldn't socialize and have a good time with the others. One positive thing that comes out of it, is that he says I am the strongest person he knows, knowing the background of my life. He says that I never seem to catch a break, and I am starting to agree, but i think the problem is that we are both at a loss as to what to do about it.

Anyway, I just feel awful in general, and lost in my life...Losing my ability to stay positive and motivated. I always tried to do what was responsible and most practical, and even if I didn't like it, it was all about ""powering through""...but maybe I have made all the wrong decisions. I am not even sure what I mean to ask here. Maybe just venting... If anyone cares to even read this, it would be nice to hear if he/she has any advice.",05Nov2017,3

There is a flash of memory. When they wouldnt stop tickling me. I plead for them to stop. It hurt yet I was laughing and they just wouldnt stop doing it. I remember when the moment went blank. I shut off all feeling. Like flicking off a tv. I turned it off because I couldnt take it anymore. I felt helpless. Attacked. Unheard. No one would help me. But I can't remember anything before that or after that.

When I look at the memory, I teeter between it being my grandma tickling me and my uncle.

I can't tell what is real about it aside from my helplessness. I felt it deep in my belly, and when I accepted the rape, I sobbed a lifetime of tears. But then my mind questions it's validity.

Seeing the world become so interconnected through marvelous advances (social media, smartphones, I recently found out I can translate text through my phone camera and it blew. my. mind) has left me thinking this ball floating in blackness is a utopia.

Yet it's real shit going on everywhere else. The world's political systems and borders in no way match the stability we've enjoyed and become accustomed to. Twenty five MILLION people are currently subjected to frightening daily life in a totalitarian hellhole. It was only just recently in the course of human events that East Berliners gained the freedom of mobility, a basic human right in one of the most advanced countries on earth! Elsewhere in Europe, a brutal war was fought in the next five years, complete with horrifying ethnic cleansing. Fast forward to two years ago, Yezidis were genocided by religious fanatics, fighting a war in a series of revolutions that's sparked a global refugee crisis. Saudi women literally just got the ability to drive!

We like to think that the world has evolved past feudalism and petty border disputes since we have infinite comfort from the horrors of war and since we can read about it on a screen in between watching Riverdale and swiping right or left on a hundred girls' asses. Whatever conflicts we have been involved in, we've been distantly separated from the fighting to the point where it's not even really a thought in the back of our heads.

27,"I, a 25/M  American from Chicago, first traveled South East Asia for 4 months before settling in Shanghai, China for two years to teach English. One thing I noticed is how my social doors suddenly opened. I could make friends with anybody. I was attractive to women (who admittedly are looking for foreign passport holders to 'escape' a life of poverty). And I was immediately employable in the realm of English teaching. I could and did find a girlfriend which had been elusive for my entire collegiate life. 

Since graduating from college with a communications degree, I have never had any luck in the job market. This is a depressing, and honestly makes me paranoid as I doubt online job postings and I think that most companies are disingenuous with the reality of their hiring. I don't have the brain of an engineer or mathematician, and I'm not ready to commit to a career with an expensive Master's Degree permanently setting me up in the states.

After one of my jobs (and relationship) ended in Shanghai, I failed to find anything else, and returned to America. Now I live in Sarasota, Florida, where the average age is 65. I am not set up to succeed here with jobs only related to healthcare and socially devoid of anybody my age. The only good thing here is that I live with my grandpa's younger brother, who never had family, and recently had surgery severing his Femoral Nerve, meaning he needs someone to live with him as he tries to move to the first floor from the 3rd floor. (He can barely walk with one of his legs).

So now I'm pondering my next move. I'm thinking I want to teach English in Bangkok, Thailand or Hanoi, Vietnam. China is good for making money but the society is too focused on it. You can't impress anyone with a $2,000 a month salary which I feel like I'm going to get for the foreseeable future. 
I would prefer to get a career here which would set me up for a career abroad making more but somehow I don't see that coming true. So I sit here in Sarasota, biding my time, contemplating my next move.  Would appreciate your thoughts and if you've been in my situation.

28,"It is one of recent history's greatest ironies that somehow, in the Western public's majority consensus, sexual permissiveness has been transformed from being the expression of 'free love' rebelling against a prudish parental generation... into an expression of 'patriarchy' -- of all things. 

This stunning socio-ethical 180° is either the product of a crashing stupidity on the side of those (supposedly) in opposition to patriarchy, or the product of the most cunning malice on the side of those in favor of it. Or both, possibly. 

**--REMINDER--** 

**This is, in a nutshell, how patriarchy works:** 

* 'Greetings, young man! My daughter has brought to my attention that you seem to have been taking great interest in her, is that true? Well, you do look rather healthy and the right age, so come to my estate tomorrow afternoon, and we shall have a cup of tea together and examine what you have made of yourself thus far, and what your prospects are, and if you would indeed be a good match for my daughter. If all applies, I shall then issue my fatherly approval, upon which you will vow to take my daughter to be your wife, to be true to her in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, to love her and honor her till death do you apart. Then you may hump the bride. Harump. (Oh, and please make sure to bring records of how many camels and gold &amp; silver shekels you and/or your family currently possess. That will greatly facilitate the process.)' 

So make no mistake: the audacity of a crude Weinsteinean 

* ***'Hey hotness, wanna shag?*** **( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)** ***'*** 

... is the complete *ANTITHESIS* to the patriarchal way of doing things. It is precisely *therein* where its audacity lies: 'Who does this whippersnapper take he is that he may be so impetuous about his desires and sidestep the father's blessing?'\* 

That's indecent. That's offensive. That's a crime. ***From the patriarchal POV.*** 

So the current rising public consensus that *'Hey hotness, wanna shag?'* should essentially be viewed and ultimately treated as a crime almost or entirely on one level with *rape* is far from an outcry against patriarchy. **It's patriarchy's great come back.**

It seems innocent enough at first, but then I started paying attention and looking into exactly what it was a little more. Here are a couple of the videos that started to make me think that maybe something sinister was behind it:


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7D-73b492Q -- 400,000+ views. The comments are what get me here. They're all short and positive, and from duplicate accounts.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4xHXPVpQD4 -- 75,000,000+ views. It's a 3d naked baby, with a weird song. And the comments again...


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhnZwj9vJ3Q -- 3,000,000+ views. It's a 3d pacman eating soccer balls. When he eats the last one, the sound of a grown man screaming in horror plays. The comments again.


Those were weird enough, but then she found this in the related videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXATjvr_rl4 -- 350,000,000+ views. No big deal, sort of cute and funny. But some of the videos related to that are babies in the tub or toddlers on the toilet. It's just...strange.


I guess I may just be paranoid, but something about it all doesn't sit right with me. I just can't pinpoint it, but it feels wrong. Does anyone have any thoughts on it, or if this is the wrong place, can someone point me in the direction of a place that may be more appropriate?

If a blind person can change a diaper by smell or feel strategically, I need to rethink my life.

38,"Hi, I'm not sure how to phrase any of this. I don't even want to to type anything because I think it has been engrained in me to not talk about feelings or stuff. But sometimes it gets a lot, and I can't handle it, and it would be good to talk to someone who wouldn't give me shit for it. ",05Nov2017,1
39,"So I don't know if there is anything wrong with me but I have been thinking about someone I graduated HS with on a daily basis, I graduated on 2014 so as you can tell its been some time already.

Its not like we had a relationship, but we were really close, she liked me and I liked her, but I didn't have the balls to confess as the beta teenager I was.
Anyways, I feel like lately I've been thinking about her way too much, I've even had dreams about her, I stalk what she likes on Instagram and FB and try to see what she is currently doing with her life, even have a lot of her pictures saved on my phone, went to a nice vacation with friends and was having a blast until I got drunk and couldn't stop thinking about how fun it would be to be on the vacation with her.

She is studying abroad and I haven't seen her in 3 years, haven't spoken to her in that same amount of time.
The last time we saw each other I noticed she looked really surprised and happy to see me (kind of like when you see someone you thought was dead) but I IGNORED her and pretended I didn't see her, since I have social anxiety and she was with a group of friends.

So whats wrong with me? Why am I obsessed over someone who I can't seeminly get over? I have had one other partner in this timespan and I thought about my HS crush sometimes in the relationship.

40,"I'm a 20 year old college student in the first semester of my junior year. I've been friends with this girl since sophomore year. At first, we were just friends, but last semester I started to fall for her, and this semester, we've been hanging out more and more and I'm completely in love with her. We talk almost every day, just getting dinner and hanging out, and I think that she's the greatest person in the world.

But I don't think she feels the same way. Yesterday I texted her, and she said that we should go out and buy candy at the store, and get dinner after, and we did, and it was great. She told me all about her life, and we went over old stories from the past. I wanted to say something about it to her but I didn't, because I was afraid. We were only together for two hours but it felt like forever. 

It's gotten so bad that it's all I can think about. I've never liked someone this much in my life. Whenever I go on a date, I end up comparing that girl to this girl, and no one compares. I want to cut her out of my life, and get rid of her, but I keep fucking it up. I always send her a snapchat, or message her, or she messages me and I reply. I've never felt anything this strongly in my life. I'm constantly thinking about her. 

I know that if I tell her, our friendship is over, but at this point I don't care, I just want distance to make this feeling go away.

How can I tell her how I feel? I feel like a creep. I just want to pull the trigger and end this.",05Nov2017,1
