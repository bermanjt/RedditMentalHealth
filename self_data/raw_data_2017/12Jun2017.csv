0,"I guess I've just been in a miserable mood all day, and this is the most recent and cogent thought of that type.

there's this notion floating around that there's a certain narcissism involved in shyness. That the fear of being judged or looking stupid comes from some prideful need to appear perfect, or from thinking you're oh-so-important that people actually care about you. The second interpretation is hat gets to me. I see it given outright as advice for shy people in this day and age: ""Just do/say whatever, no one cares.""

If they don't care, if I'm so worthless and insignificant no one could ever acknowledge or care about me for a moment, why should I bother saying anything at all? If my contribution to the conversation or discussion isn't going to be acknowledged, if everyone's so indifferent to me they're not even going to care what I say or do, if I may as well not even be there, then why am I wasting my time? If I'm so insignificant that it's basically a secular sin for me to do anything, why should I, unless gaining a spurt of attention is one of the motives? It's baffling that this is actually handed out as advice to overcome shyness: ""Oh, it's okay, you're unlovable and no one gives a fuck that you exist, so you might as well do whatever."" Yeah, that's really encouraging. Not that I disagree that self-esteem is delusional, but sheesh. 

And I don't believe in doing things for my own enjoyment. If I'm going to put effort into a project, or a reply, I want a fucking response, however small. If I'm going to say something to another person, or in front of a group of people, I'd like it to be acknowledged for better or worse. Everyone else gets that sort of respect, am I really so bad I don't deserve it too?

First time post, not sure if this is where it goes.

Anyway my boyfriend and I went to a comedy show and the comedian had a joke about how every guy has tucked his wiener so he could see what it would look like if he had a mangina. Later on I asked my boyfriend if this was true and if he had done it and he told me of course he's done it and that every guy has done it. Then he asks if I wanted to know what it was like to have a penis and I'm like of course I want to know. So he happens to have a boner, maybe I should mention he had a boner prior to the start of the conversation, and he tells me to take my pants off and lay on top of him facing the ceiling and he'll put his boner between my legs. So now I know what its like to have a penis and I gotta say it is a weird feeling between your thighs. Anyone else ever do this?",12Jun2017,43

10,"There was a thread on /r/askmen where someone asked how to ""escalate to sex"". 

I don't have time to get into more of my philosophy about this at the moment, but here was my response:


Here's what I do:

""Hey ......, I'd like to play. Here's what I have in mind: I'd like to do ..... to you (or have you do ...... to me). Is that something you'd like?"" I describe details. Then I give her space and time and breathing room to feel into that vision, into her body, and into her soul in that moment, and see if she's actually a yes.

I literally ask for consent every step of the way. From a handhold, to a shoulder touch, to a hug, to a kiss, a breast massage, to any type of sexual act... whatever. I ask what type of touch. I ask about pressure. I ask for preferences and desires. If It's been a while since I've done whatever consent was given for, I re-ask. I don't assume consent for anything in one instance means automatic consent for the same thing in the future.

12,"I’ve got a host of issues and I have no clue how to fix them. I’m in a stressful job and don’t have any options to leave it. I’m covered a mountain of debt. I have a drinking problem, I don’t really have any friends. To sum it up my life is a mess and I don’t know how to dig myself out of it.

My job stresses me out. I work in a call center and everything that I do during my shift is recorded, measured and analyzed. The work pace constant and there isn’t any downtime outside of scheduled breaks. I understand that working in an air conditioned building is nice but the job is mentally and emotionally stressful. I don’t have any prospects advancement because I don’t have a degree. My company does offer tuition reimbursement but I’m afraid to make another attempt at school. Late 2015 early 2016 I was briefly in a respected online school but was kicked out due to low grades. I was so mentally fatigued after work that couldn’t do anything after coming home except drink or go straight to bed.

As my username implies I have a drinking problem. Before my current job I’d only occasionally binge drink on the weekends. After the stress of my job started to get to me I started drinking every night after work. Then I fell in with a group of coworkers that would drink heavily during the week and weekends. I’ve slowed down my drinking but I still seem to have at least 1 – 2 drinks a day. I want to cut back to drinking only once or twice a week but I’ve been unable to. When I drink I turn into a complete idiot. I’ve somehow avoided any legal trouble but I know that it’s a roll of the dice each time I get drunk.

I’ve looked for other coping methods for my life but I haven’t come up with anything else. Sometimes when I’m stressed I’ll binge on lottery tickets or go to the strip club.  Both things have caused me to accumulate a hefty amount of credit card debt. And I usually wind up drunk when I go to the strip club anyway. I’ve considered anti-depressants but quite a few of my coworkers are on them and they seemed to be just as stressed out by the job as me or worse. I've also thought about weed but I really don't need anymore vices in my life. I know that I have an addictive personality so I don't need to add any other potential problems to the list.

To make matters worse I don’t have any friends. I have a few coworkers that I’ll go drinking with but they drink even more heavily than myself and liver can’t keep up with them. I have a friend that lives 3 hours away from me. She only stays in contact with me because she’s always trying to get me to take her to see her ex that broke up with her. I’d cut her off but I’d never have anyone to talk to on the phone and although I know that she isn’t into guys we made out one night and I kind of hope that we could do it again.

I want to get in a relationship but I don't think that will ever work out. I've spent more of my life single than being with someone. When I'm single I'm lonely and crave physical intimacy. When I'm in a relationship I always feel like I don't have enough alone time and start to feel miserable.

I really don't think that I'll ever be happy with my life.

14,"So I'm going back to school for a computer science degree, and I'm doing it all online. The classes take up a couple of hours a night, and I'm cool with that. My problems start to come when I factor in my 40 hour a week job, and that I have two kids and a wife that just went back to school too. When I started school again we agreed that I would start my work after dinner, which would mean that everyone went upstairs so as to not bother me. As of late I've found that the time for everyone to leave me be has crept later and later, and lately it's been closer to 9 or 10 before I can start working. This means that I might be working on something until well after midnight, when I need to be up before 6 to get the kids ready for school.
My wife on the other hand, has been doing her homework as soon as she gets home from work, and then asking me for tutoring help after dinner. I would normally be happy to help, but it seems like the requests for my time to do things get more common, and my own work starts later.
My concern is that with me getting less than 6 hours of sleep on average, and trying to complete school work basically in the middle of  the night, is that I'll burn out and give up on school just so I can sleep, or that I'll try to ""quit"" one of my other jobs.",12Jun2017,3

- Don't by into hype alone. STOP PRE-ORDERING GAMES

- Listen to *reviews*, not developers' promises.

- Don't be afraid to pirate to try out games before dropping $60. That way, if you don't like the game, the devs aren't rewarded with your money.

- Avoid early access like the plague. Early access is an excuse to release half a game for the price of a full game.

- If a game is consistently buggy or lacking of promised features, don't pity the devs simply because they are indie devs.

- Know when devs are adding new content to a game you like VS milking you for more money. This distinction will vary from person to person.

- Don't be afraid to leave nasty reviews.

- This final point goes for any decent sized purchase, but sleep on it before buying it.",12Jun2017,52

The story takes place in an abandoned amusememt park which is a shelter is an apocalyptic world envaded by monsters. Every week, one of the characters is nominated for exile to go to the outside world and face its hardships. As you may probably tell, this game is heavily inspired by the Danganronpa series and the Zero Escape series, both of which sold very well in the NA/EU region. The game raises many questions in the players' heads. Why is Alice doing this? What is the purpose of this game? Why us 12? etc...

24,"An eye can't look at an eye, an ear can't hear an ear, skin can't feel itself, only sensations presented to it. Keep in mind, I am speaking about the level of this dream, not Truth. Truth does not perceive anything, but contains all perception.

So, it's not unreasonable to ask how awareness could be aware of itself. In your own experience there is a sense that you are aware of things your senses present to you, correct? If you will look closely, it's obvious (within this dream of humanness) that you are aware you have awareness. This is awareness of awareness. It's very simple. Awareness can be aware of awareness and even aware that it is aware that it is aware.. of itself.

Taking this a step further, as you look out upon the dream we call this world, awareness (BTW, it's not ''your'' awareness, it's the same in every human) is filled up with a variety of objects, more accurately they are hallucinations. They distract from a most amazing thing, the apparency that you are aware. What fills the senses is taken to be the important facet when it is insignificant compared to the illusion that you are aware, and further, that you appear to be aware you are aware.

What is purpose of all my noise, well.. I suggest you focus on the fact that you do appear to be aware and are aware of that appearance. If you can focus enough on it you may well get to the truth of that illusion. There is no such thing as awareness, there is no one or thing that could ever be aware and yet, awareness does appear.. all within a dream and nothing more. The way out is through. Don't try to think your way out, that doesn't work.

32,"Today was the second time in a week that my mother has driven me to tears, thankfully I avoided a full anxiety attack because I hung up.

A little background, since my Senior Year in high school, I've been non-religious. Eventually it came out to my mom, and we yelled and screamed until she kicked me out and told me to go live at my dad's. It's been a source of contention for us ever since.

Fast forward to last Sunday, when my niece was having her birthday party and then getting baptized that night. I wasn't able to come to the party because of work, but she was about to be moving to Texas and I wasn't going to see her for a while, so I decided to go to the baptism.

I dressed up, got to the church, was happy for my niece, even took some video. Then the service started. I bowed my head at all the right places, I was quiet, I did not get on my phone, I listened to the entire sermon attentively. It was disgusting, but that was just the church, I don't think that every Christian is like that. Even still, I said nothing. But the one thing I didn't do was stand up for the songs. I was already anxious about being in a church with all the people I didn't know, and something just felt wrong about it. Like I was lying. So I stayed seated.

The next day I call my mother and she starts asking me about why I didn't stand up. I tell her she knows exactly why, and this sends her into a tirade about how I embarrassed her, how she has to explain to all of the people at church why I didn't stand up.

That I had disrespected my niece...

That my life was going to shit because I didn't have God...

That I hated her...

That she must have went wrong somewhere raising me...

After all this I was in full anxiety attack mode, so I'm just saying ""Okay"" and ""I'm Sorry"" because that's all I can manage to get out.

Finally the call ends and I call my dad (they're divorced). He helps me calm down, tells me I don't have to worry about being anyone else or believing what anyone else does. It helps, and I finally get my composure back.

So me and mom decide to sit down some time and talk about it, but it keeps getting put off until she calls me today. Conversation starts off civil enough. Then she brings up that my dad called her. 

""Why'd you have to call him? Why'd you have to bring him into our stuff?""

I try to explain that I just needed someone to calm me down, but she starts throwing it in my face that I went to him when he just left when I was younger and wasn't a parent (things that me and him have had our issues about, talked about, cried about, and I have forgiven him for). She complains that I just wanted someone to tell me what I wanted to here. (In this case, someone to tell me that I wasn't some awful 'other' than is an embarrassment to my family. You know, why would anyone need to hear that?)

It keeps going and we keep getting heated again until I finally can't take it and hung up to avoid another episode.

I just don't know what to do. I tried to be respectful, I have tried so hard to not tall about my religious views, to act like I'm just like everyone else. But it's exhausting, and eventually having to hide like this hurts.

And I know how this sounds. Woe is me, the lonely atheist. There are LGBTQ and people of other religions getting absolutely terrorized by people around the world. And I'm here in tears because my mom said some hurtful things. 

I just don't know what else to do any more. I have tried to hide and change whatever I could to allow for me and her to have a healthy relationship. But all she seems to see me as is someone sick and wrong, the weird kid that doesn't agree with her on anything and just wants to make her miserable. When all I wanted to do was try my best to have a good relationship with her, despite our differences...

33,"Two things are happening regarding them. One, I'm remembering them in incredible detail all of a sudden. Usually I'd remember maybe two dreams per week. Only to completely forget about those eventually. But in the last week, I've been remembering multiple dreams every morning. I've just realised I actually have multiple dreams a night. I don't usually remember when one begins and end, but I can usually tell their order in a way.

The second thing, and this is what prompted me to write this, is that every night at least one of those dreams features a certain girl. In the first dream she was an escort I was seeing for some reason, in another dream she was stripper I loved, in another she saves me from some fight, and in today's dream she was barmaid I was chatting to. Its the same face each time and I can't get it out my head. I've never met a girl with this exact face before, so I'm confused and kinda creeped out? Why is my brain so fixated on this imaginary person? The only thing I can think that could be causing all of this is maybe that I wasn't sleeping much last month due to some important exams, but that's about it.

Her mother died a few months after a two year battle with dementia, and now her father is gone too. He passed much faster... Just a few months ago Id see him on an afternoon walk in my neighborhood. He had a fall, and he just... Deteriorated quickly. Three days ago I visited him in the care center and he was barely able to open his eyes because of his liver failure. He shook my hand, I said Id visit him next week and that I loved him... And now he's gone.

My greatest regret is never knowing the man that well. We're both introverted so we just kind of did our thing. There's  so much Id love to ask him, and say to him... But now he's gone. 

I knew my grand mother better... But it still hurts. Before her breakdown I had been living across the country. I remember her calling me late one night crying, begging me to come home. She said she felt like something was going to happen. I moved back six months later... But not long after I got back her memory failed completely and the person who was my grandmother ceased to be. Two years later she died, but in my mind she died long before that. I WISH she had died before that. I wouldnt wish dementia on... Anybody. Id rather die of cancer, even the worst of it than have to be a witness to my own mind shattering into a million little pieces, and being in a fugue state of pain and fear until I die.

Now to the other times.

She asked if I heard the doorbell ring and I looked back, confused, and simply said ""no"" while looking like a scared pidgeon or something (I'm bad at metaphors). She definitely saw what was going on as she was quite fast to leave the room.

Now to the time where I fucked up the most. At this point I had learned to lock my god damn door (something I shouldn't have to do if you ask me). So I have a few kinks, one of which is for gasmasks (weird, I know) so I brought that out coupled with a dildo and started video chatting with a ""friend"".

I didn't turn the lock all the way around. I didn't fucking lock the door. And would you know?

I heard the door open, turned my head around and whimpered ""hi"" while struggling to cover my parts. She walked in one me having a dildo in my ass, wearing a gasmask while video chatting. She said something and walked out. Couldn't hear since I was wearing a gasmask, but I'm sure she said something.

I have GAD and a situation like this really fucked with my head. I got so fucking stressed and nervous I vomited twice that night. I wonder what she thinks about me. It feels like she's disapointed, but she hasn't mentioned it, not even hinted that anything happened.

Because of the bended spine, my hips aren't straight and one legsocket is like a bit more upwards than it should be, so my leg evolved to pretty much a balerina state of always tiptoe walking. I am a velociraptor (rawr)

I spend a lot of time thinking about many things and I feel the need to tell someone but not someone I know. Idk how to call this feeling but it makes me feel good that someone can listen, and not be emotionally connected to me but have a humanly and intelectualy aknowledging connection. If that makes sense.

When I was younger I was a Christian, and I often cried in bed and thought why did god make me this way. But one day I snapped and realised I didn't care if any great being exists and stopped worrying about it which substantionally increased my overall happiness and mental freedom.

Everything is not happy go lucky in my life, I am actually pretty twisted. I have anger issues, and if I was healthy I'd probably one day probably commit crime like beat up people I don't like and end up in prison for it. Being deformed made me think in another way. A way I can be. I love playing online games, I love reading interesting stories. I love supernatural or fantasy related content in any form. I love thinking about the universe, about people and their strugles. 

Even though I am a real introvert and have only 2 best friends. I like to think about my social prowess as pretty advanced. I am really charismatic and easy to talk to. People usually like talking to me and I usually manage to find a great subject to talk about while finding great jokes.

Also I'm really into metal music. My fav genre is Metalcore and Melodic Death. I like to think that metal saved me and shaped my mentality the most. My friend and I play instruments together. He is the guitarist and I'm the drummer. I'd say we're doing pretty great, and for some reason I don't get tired playing drums. They're like the perfect instrument for me. I also made my brother teach himself to play guitar so when we get bored we sacrifice goats to our lord and saviour Satan http://imgur.com/a/P4bTH

The only things I'd like to change in myself is my impulsiveness because things that drive me are Justice, Logic, Knowledge and Passion.
Also sitting on the computer screen has made me pretty weak and I can only walk about 1 minute and get extremely tired like I'll die. I could walk kilometres before and climb mountains even with my condition (gibe fix advice pls)

Why did I write this? To let of a burden of my chest, idk what kind of burden, but getting this far already makes me feel kind of better. Also if anyone is in a similar situation, please think about yourself daily and find a way for you to be you. If I was legless and armless and Only had my head and mouth I would seek a way to be me.


edit: forgot to mention... Feel free to ask me questions, I'd love to answer them",12Jun2017,7
