1,"4 month old Australian Bulldog and while I'm working with him on the training and he really is coming along, I'm becoming increasingly frustrated at his repeatedly doing shit he gets told off for. 

He is really good at doing things he knows he gets rewards for, but how do you reward a dog for being calm? Or not biting you when you scratch him? Or behaving when you turn your back on him for 30 seconds? 

I know he is just a puppy and you have to work with them and teach them but today was the first day Ive looked at him and thought ""Getting you was a mistake"" and I hate that I thought that.",20Feb2017,1
2,"I am 27 and have been seeing my first girlfriend for a few months now. 

A few weeks back I lost it. It was awkward and very fast. But she was really nice and understanding, and she showed me other ways to get her off. 

We have had sex about 8 times since and now my endurance is really starting to bother me. Last night being three of those. She said I'm lasting longer but I don't think I'll ever last long enough at the moment. 

Last time she was controlling the pace, stopping whenever I got close. She actually timed it and it lasted 45 minutes which was great, however she had to stop every time she got close because I wasn't going to make it. Like I said she has been amazing but I can tell stopping when she was so close was frustrating for her and I feel bad. 

Did you ever have this problem? Was there anything that helped? ",20Feb2017,4
6,"Around the time I hit puberty, most sources of pleasure in daily life began to dry up. First went video games, then movies, later literature, and finally all videos. Short conversations with a friend, the sound of falling rain, and attachment to characters in a story are just a few of all the things I no longer enjoy. Now, music is fading too. This past month, nothing's clicked like usual. And I'm worried.

I got a therapist at the start of the year, I've been taking walks daily, and I've meditated, but still nothing has clicked. For the past year, I've tried to phone in interests, but that just doesn't work. At this point it seems like only a random miracle can restore my passion for anything. 

I don't know what to do now. The future looks really bleak.",20Feb2017,1

9,"I already attempted self end days ago but now I know what really happens after you die. It is not a tunnel of light or sleeping without dreaming. It is a very painful experience. I do not want to share what actually happened because it is very traumatizing for me and no this is not just my interpretation of a NDE. It is merely what I witnessed.
Lucid dreaming started happening with me everyday since I attempted suicide. I even have it happen to me during the day. It is a shocking experience for me. However there is something that also came about. Deja Vu every single moment. The Deja Vu flashbacks happen even when I am asleep or am having an OBE. Suddenly two days ago I ended up being pulled into Sleep Paralysis. I felt just like I did when I was unconscious during my surgery after I attempted. However I felt this pain, extreme pain. It felt like every organ in my body was being torn apart and then it felt like something I can't even describe. I guess it felt like drowning but it was so surreal. My body felt like it someone was pulling its tendons with gravity. I felt a plastic taste in my mouth, or at least what I thought I was tasting. Or if I was tasting something at all. At this point I was in a state of something so bizarre and unorthodox.
I have done drugs plenty of times in the past. A huge variety. Even over lethal doses. However, I have never felt anything like this.
You don't just black out once dead. You become something more, far more. There will be immense pain and discomfort but with a feeling of mass claustrophobia. You will want to just vomit or beg for your natural human senses but you can't. You then fade into something. A vibrant array of colors.
It gets worse. You feel like you're alive again but you simply are just blackness at this point. Your body can't turn back and is in so much pain but can't move whatsoever.
I woke up and then I realized my body had blanked out from being severely dehydrated. I feed through IV and I voluntarily stopped eating or drinking. Perhaps my body brought itself back to life through subconscious compulsions that I was unaware of. (The IV was there near my injection site)
It felt like being dropped into an ocean as soon as I came back. My mouth was dry as the Sahara desert. I fell asleep later on.
Also, this may seem like just another interpretation of NDE but my mind is truthfully convinced that this is what happens after death. I can't shake it out. Please be kind in the comments.
TLDR: Death is a permanent OBE fused with extremely painful Sleep Paralysis and the constant medium between willingness and unwillingness of wanting human senses.

20,"I slept until eleven. I distractedly browsed reddit. I got dressed then got breakfast at a diner down the street. It was coffee and crepes with out of season fruit. It was okay.

I came home and drank wine. Two bottles of wine. It was pretty good wine. I ordered chinese. I'm a little bit high.

Facebook is open in one of twenty tabs, and it's not the nine birthday wishes on there or my phone that bothers me. I'm bothered by why: it's the distance I keep.

Sometime between 19 and 20, I had sworn up and down this is the year, at 27, that I die. To give myself credit, I believed I'd do better than the childhood bedroom in my parents house: I had thought alone in a studio apartment, with a noose past the end of my bed. And I'd be there now if I hadn't bought a one-way flight to backpack through Europe. I've been saving money - that's the excuse - and I made that the truth. 

The other truth is I can't do it on my own, and today reminds me why. This time two years ago, I had survived two months on ho-ho's and cheetos and miller high life. The store was further than the gas station, and the gas station was on the way to work. It wasn't the easiest path; it was the path of least resistance, but don't think of it like a circuit. I know the way I've walked grows more difficult than the alternatives, but a slow burn doesn't frighten me like the hot flash of change. The daily exhaustion and monthly illness is just the familiar march to death, and I swore, up and down, this was the year.

There's nothing keeping me but my small family. Maybe that's enough. I thought friendship was critical. I don't think that anymore. I don't hardly know those nine people, and I know they don't know me. That's why they leave me a message: it's just who they are, to leave kind thoughts with strangers. It's not who I am, it's nothing to do with who I am. I am absent. 

No one but family looks for you through a long absence. I'm lucky to have family.

I'm lucky that both a mother and a father want me me to be happy, want to take me for a birthday dinner against my wishes, want to buy me a little something of something I don't need, want to make sure I'm provided with enough, want me travel, want me to live in their house so long past eighteen. And sometimes, when we both see each other helpless to affect our decay, it's enough to know there's love there.

Feeling powerless is the lowest despair I know, and it amazes me that anyone would take that weight on. No handwringing, no blame, no self-serving improvement plans, just the desperation for some modicum of control and no apparent means to gain as much. Helpless. We're helpless. But thank fuck it's we, not I. 

In them, I have some faith for myself. Maybe this year isn't the turn I thought it was, and maybe I have more life in me. Maybe I'll get hit by a bus. Maybe I'll make a friend, or even fall in love again. Probably not, but the dream is enough. Hope is anesthetizing, and a millimeter of growth is still rewarding, in perspective. I don't need to blossom, only survive. I'll come about in time, if there's time to be had.

Today was another day. Another Sunday. I got through it like I do every day. That has to be enough because it's all I know how to do.",20Feb2017,24
21,"Dont upvote, I'm just sad :(

So it's that time of the year again. This year I will be living alone for 5 months without my parents. They will be flying off tomorrow and after spending 6 months with them, it's gonna be hard to say goodbye. I love them very much. I can't bear to lose them. They're my only best friends and without them in the house, I don't really have anyone else to talk to. My only other friend works 5 days a week now from 9 to 5 so we can only meet up on the weekends. Also, since I don't drive... (I'm really terrified of driving ever since that one time I stepped on gas instead of brake) I have to walk out to get groceries now!! That's totally fine tho.. keeps me active instead of staying home all day watching Netflix. I could really lose some weight too... I'm like 140lbs 5'2 I need to lose at least 35lbs.

24,"No one needs to read this. I wanted to get something off my chest, and I felt like it was a waste for me to have spent 45 minutes typing somethign and just deleting it, so I reformatted it and posted it here.

hey, I’m in high school, and I just had to get something off my chest. This is also one of the worst pieces of writing that i’ve done. I’m jsut writing what I’m thinking.

heres a tl;dr: I like my best friend, but through a series of fuckups, i accidentally made her like someone else. fuck.

so I like my best friend. She’s the person that makes me the happiest, and I never feel bad around her. But, she likes someone else. I wish I could say that Im better than he is, but I’m really not. Looks wise, he’s better, and I cant say that i’d treat her better either. I don’t know if she knows that I like her. If someone ever teases us around her, I always end up denying it, but I also cant help myself from getting upset every time I realize that she is talking to the other guy. She knows that I get grumpy too, and so she never tells me anything about him. Also, she’s never said that she actually likes the guy, but I still know she does. I’ve gone out with her to study and hang out before, but she’s also went out with him last week. She didn’t tell me about it, and I found out through our mutual friend. Needless to say, I was upset. Now, I just figured out that they were planning on going out again this week. Again, she claims that she doesn’t like him, but if I ever do ask her how she feels about him, she dodges the question. I also have messed up a lot. As I said, I’ve basically friend zoned myself, because I always deny that I like her. Also, the guy isnt a bad person. I guess this would be a good time to start from the beginning of the story. 

I’ve been good friends with the girl (i’ll call her bailey from now on) for a long time, but I only started liking her over the summer. Anyway, the guy (lets call him ash) came up to me sometime in october and asked if I liked her. He said that he kinda liked her, but could get over her, and that he just wanted to know if he should keep going for her or not. Being the dumbass that i am, I of course told him to go for it. That very night, I was face timing bailey, and I for some reason told her about ash. She’s super nice, so of course she didnt say anything bad about him, she just played it off. Its also good to mention that she likes people based off of their personalities. Although she definitely thinks guys are hot and stuff, she prioritizes personality and how well she knows the person over anything else. Anyway, that same night, ash calls her, and she picks up, not wanting to be mean. After that, i continued talking to bailey, and she got to know ash. I think it was after a week when I realized that i started to get jealous. That night, I texted ash, and told him that I liked bailey. He said that it was fine, and that he would back off, but I told him that it was fine, and that bailey may actually like him. Ironically, to this day ash is still the only person that i’ve told that I like bailey. Anyway, because i told him that it was fine, the two of them keep talking more and more. Sometime later, I let my jealousy escape. I started teasing her a lot more about ash, hoping that she would insist that she didnt like him, but she never did it. I think I said something along the lines of “u must like him, because u leave me on read to talk to him instead”. Although that was partially true (I would be on read while she texted ash), she did that with everyone, and I was still the person that she texted the most. But, I think that that was what caused her to stop telling me about ash. As it went on, my jealousy got worse. If i realised that she was talking to ash, I would text bailey saying (jokingly) “wow you must hate me”, and stuff like that. She of course said that she didnt, but then I would say “well you definitely don’t like me, so there really isnt a difference”. I don’t know why I said that. I think part of me believed that she would all of a sudden admit that she liked me, but there was no fuckign way. Looking back, I think that at that time, I just wanted to let her know that I did like her. Anyway, I would say shit like that, and she would keep insisting that she didnt hate me, etc. Anyway, ash asked her to “hang out” last week, and bailey said yes. I don’t know if it was because she liked him or because she’s nice and friendly, but I think she likes him. Anyway, as I said, I didnt know that she went out with ash. That night, I asked her what she did that day, and she said that she went down town, and I said “oh how fun”. It wasn’t until one of our friends asked “how was going out with ash” that I figured out, and of course, I just wanted to die when I read that. Now this week, bailey and I were face timing, and she was texting ash (we do this a lot, we call each other, but go on our phones and text other people). I started prying on what she was texting with him, but she wouldn’t tell me. Of course, I immedietly assumed that it was something that would make me upset, but I kept prying. I forgot to mention that she texts everyone on snapchat so there was no record of what she text in the past. Anyway, I convince her to show me the next snap she got from ash, and it said “so what do you want to do on thursday?”. It doesn’t take a single braincell to guess how i felt after reading that. I was jealous, and in that state of mind I jsut wanted to know more (for some reason), so I teased her, and then I asked who asked who out. Although Im pretty sure ash asked her, theres still a bit of me that is convinced that she asked him. 

I don’t know what to do. I really do like her, and I cant just “get over her”, because she’s my best friend, and the more I talk to her the more I like her. My happiest moments are with her, but when she does shit with ash is also when I feel the worse. The only way I can think of is to simply not talk to her, but thats hella hard to do. Not only do I really like her, but she’s my best friend. 

I know I fucked up. If I had been honest with ash from the start, bailey would have never talked to him, never liked him, and I wouldn’t be in this situation, but at the same time, i want bailey to be happy more than anything else. She is happy now, and who knows what she would have been like if she didnt start talking to ash. Now, I don’t want to cut her out of my life, and if ash stopped talking to her, she would be upset too. I don’t want it to happen, but eventually I assume he’s going to ask her out and they’ll start dating etc.

25,"I have this problem where I spend a lot of my time on internet right wing gathering places, pol, r/altright, etc. It's a kind of morbid fascination that is probably not good for me ultimately but there you go. It's probably why I'm still on Reddit after all these years, why I haven't migrated to Tumblr or whatever. Anyway, I came across this post earlier today that kind of stuck with me: I think I finally get why places like pol are appealing to people. 

The post basically said that they came to in this case pol out of curiosity or because they thought it'd be funny or whatever and wound up agreeing with pretty much everything the the site stood for. Specifically they were saying pol let them see through the lies presented by people and made them less happy but ultimately more aware of the state of the world. I get that, or at least I get why someone would want that feeling.

Here's the thing about the world though, I think we can pretty much agree about this: it doesn't make sense. Yes there are people doing things, even nefarious things. But there are also a lot of things to do really fit into narratives. It's hard to know how to think about a lot of facts that kind of float around in the world 
, if that makes sense. Not to imply that history/social analysis can't be useful. But these things only go part of the way, and even the best histories just leave out the things they can't explain. Narrative structure is great and comforting when we can apply it but it's dangerous to apply it to things that it shouldn't be applied to.

We have a word for clean, simple narratives about the way the world works, ideology. The great ideologies of History share an ability to make the world seem simpler than it really is without immediately seeming silly. They're closed systems by which I mean they can resolve anything. Like you can't just refute Nazism or capitalism or the ideology underpinning social democracy, etcetera, they're too expansive. Ideology is also slippery because few people will tell you outright that the thing they're trying to sell you is an ideology. Also, ideologies are pretty much wholesale mostly you can't pick and choose the parts you believe it because they all go together under the same system. So, in this case, when you accept that, whatever, black IQ is lower than white IQ (which kind of a surprisingly large number of people seem okay with? But I digress) it becomes much easier to accept other positions about globalism or whatever. 

My point is: yes there is something that seems true about the ideology espoused by pol but that doesn't make it actually true. It's worth mentioning that those of us who grew up in the West are by and large indoctrinated into this masculinist racist classist etcetera system which just so happens to be the same exact kind of system that pol et al advocate for. These places make the world seems simpler, make it make more sense, or some other wording of the same sentiment. But that isn't because they have some special access to the truth. They're just very effective at advocating an ideology you're predisposed to believing in (you the 4chan user and you the westerner). In other words they do the exact opposite of what they purport to do with the concept of redpilling. Taking the real red pill would involve letting go of all ideology again just seeing the world as it is, a complicated and confusing mess. I mean, I'm not ready to do that I sure as hell don't think the uses of ready for it. So instead we take the blue pill and remain in our comforting ideological worlds.

(that said, some ideologies are better than others. If yours is making you miserable AND teaching you to hate, you should probably give up on it.)

I know, it is ridiculous to be jealous of my sister, who is still kid. But ever since I introduced my boyfriend to my sister, she is kind of obsessed with him. She talks about him all the time, how great guy he is etc. And he reinforces that by taking all three of us to cinema or other kid friendly events frequently, to see kids movies. He also gives her expensive gifts for good grades or birthday and generally is being really sweet with her.

Sometimes, I feel like he likes her even more than me and that they are more happier together than we are in the relationship. I told him how I feel, that sometimes it looks like he likes my little sister more than me, and he just shrugged it off that she is like a daughter-in-law to him, and he wants to be good to her.

They didn't say hello as they weren't even sure if it was me or not and I was way too embarrassed to say anything so we just sort of stared at each other and then kept going.

34,"Before I begin, why don't we all gather around and agree that I should've moved on years ago; I know that. I never expected things to come this far, but here I am.

Around five to six years ago I met this girl on Call of Duty Black Ops Zombies, one of my most ""proudest"" moments. Going in I had no wish to get close to a woman I met online, especially if it was over a damn video game, I always thought those kinds of things were so weird and lonely...ha.

We played for a bit and she told me her name was Janine Romero, and she was from California. I decided to add her as a friend so we could keep playing together because she was so much fun, and that's what we did. We would play every now and then for a couple months and that was it. After that we started talking a little more and getting to know each other. We soon started talking a lot, and things started speeding up between us. It got to the point where we were talking almost every day either through message or over the microphone. I didn't even know what this woman looked like, and I had already started to catch feelings for her, she was hilarious, something that I still have not yet been able to find in another woman, she was so laid back and she was careless--about what others thought of her, and about what she said to me, she would say what was on her mind and didn’t give a shit about the repercussions, and I loved it. After a couple more months we decided to send each other pictures of what we looked like, and when I saw her I was speechless. I couldn't believe it. How could such a gorgeous person be interested in going this far with some pimpled goober she met on a game ridden with 12 year-olds? After we sent each other pictures things began to get even more serious. We started talking 24/7, to the point where she would beg me not to sleep and I would be pulling all-nighters, it was constant. Soon after came the love bomb, she dropped it first, and it hit me like a ton of bricks, I wasn't even sure I knew what love was. I just knew that this woman always turned my thinking upside-down, gave me that weird nervous feeling in my stomach, and the need to talk to her always intensified. So I said it back.

Things went on between us for months, at this point we had known each other for over a year and been seriously talking for eight or so months. We would talk on the phone, via text and call and still talk on the PlayStation. I had plans to go out to California where she said she lived and meet her in person, but then things started to go downhill.

I fucked up, that’s all I’m going to say, it’s my fault, and I’ll always regret it.

We slowly drifted apart, and after one big fight, it all stopped. A couple weeks after we stopped talking I decided I had to forget. It was time to suppress the entire memory, I deleted her username, I deleted the phone number she gave me, everything. I realized how sad it all was and that I needed to pretend none of it ever happened.

Four months after we stopped talking she messages me. She asks me how I'm doing, if everything's okay, and what’s going on with me now. And I respond in the most brain-dead way possible. I brushed her off and acted all cool for the sake of just looking cool, I didn't want to look hurt and weak so I overcompensated with the super-chill brohemoth we all hate in movies. I told her everything's ""cool"" and she was ""cool"" and that was it. I deleted her again and that was it.

I've tried moving on, by having real relationships, but they haven't been much of a priority to me, they never really mattered. It’s kind of hard to compare to your first ""love"" I suppose. I just need to get her off my mind, but that's so damn hard to do.

Its been five years and I still haven't found her, I’ve tried messaging her back and emailing her back, but I just get error messages, I have gotten closer though. I reverse-searched her email and found an old AOL page with her and her friends, but I found out her actual name is Isabella. I was definitely lied to at least a little bit, but I know I wasn't cat-fished, because she emailed me using the AOL account, and Isabella looks the exact same as Janine's pictures did.

I know I'm getting closer, I just can’t find any social media pages, nothing--she told me she has none, which is fine, cause neither do I.  I have more information on her, but I don’t think it’s enough. And I don't want to put it up on the internet for everyone to see. I'm trying to do this in the most professional, least creepy way possible--and I'm running out of options; after five years of looking on and off, and somewhat obsessing over this “silly little incident”, I'm growing tired—and I need help.

So I suppose if anyone reads this, and you know an Isabella from Anaheim/Orange County California, maybe your name is Brenda or Alex, or Juliana...let her know Jacob From Minnesota is trying to reach her, and he’s matured a little bit more in the last five years. If you know some sort of way you could help me out, let me know, I’ve been open to suggestions for four years now.

Oh and Janine/Isabella, if you're reading this, I’m sorry. I’d say it a million times but that would dilute each ones meaning.

35,"A story about the first ever time I came out to someone: 

I'm from Malaysia. LGBT rights are barely a thing here. They're not a thing, actually. It's hard to talk about sexuality. Anyway, read this. 

I was fourteen or fifteen and on a flight to India with my family. My family has four people, and the rows on the airplane had only three seats each. I had to sit away, and so I took a window seat. A man with hair the colour of sand sat beside me and promptly fell asleep. 

He was asleep for most of the flight, until the plane began to land. I had a cold at the time and it hurt my ears. He must have woken up and noticed that, and offered me some gum. I was suspicious of taking food from a stranger but I chewed on it anyway, it helped. 

I asked him where he was from. He said Canada, and told me where it was on the map. I said I thought it was huge, and asked if he knew French. He said he did and I was glad because I was doing French at school. We talked for a bit and then it went silent. 

I figured, heck, he's a stranger. And one from Canada, so he's less likely to react with the shock or disgust that most in Malaysia would if I were to tell them I wasn't heterosexual. 

Years have passed and the details are blurry. But I told him that I thought I was a lesbian. I remember saying 'Sometimes I'm ashamed...' and I remember him saying '*No*, don't be ashamed!'

I asked him his name towards the end of the conversation. He said Shawn (I have no idea how to spell it). We got off the plane. I never saw him again. 

I still remember him occasionally. He was the very first person in the world to whom I admitted what I thought at the time was an ugly, horrible truth about myself. 

With time I've experimented (yes, I've managed to do that even in a place like here.) and come to the conclusion that I'm bi, and lean towards girls. 

But, still. He gave me faith that I could be accepted and respected and I still think of him occasionally.

40,"I usually buy from walmart (online) because I dont trust many online companies that sell them (plus they are easy to return if you need to), but walmart has been pissing me off lately by not having any sales. So I'm looking for new avenues of deals when it comes to SD cards.

As the title says I'm so sick right now. Not to be too graphic but this is a double end situation. I could really use a distraction in between trips to the bathroom. ",20Feb2017,1

I'm a 14 boy living with a bigoted father who thinks that there's a gay epidemic with all the people coming out these days. I've never voiced my opinion; normally I just nod to whatever he says and wait for his mindless ranting to come to an end. I just happen to be bisexual with a preference of men. Now, I'm just counting down the years that I have to live under this fake identity until I can start my own life, preferably far away from here.

When I was on the brink of puberty, I found myself having dreams about boys from my class and obviously sexual events had taken place though I guess it'd be better that I not share the details of an underage person's sexual fantasies with another underage person.

I've had girlfriends in the past at which my father would be a total bro and obviously approving of our relationship. My girlfriend would always be making sexual advances to which I was basically neutral in affection toward her. I've had three girlfriends, all seeming to be horny as all hell and wanting to have sex whereas I had always been indifferent toward it. Sometimes they when we were alone, laying together, they would put their hands in my pants and fondle me while I would just lay there motionless, not knowing what to do. I had sexual urges that I felt like acting upon however something always just didn't seem right about it. 

I visited my first girlfriend's house and met her family back in 8th grade and it began to be a weekly occurrence that I would visit every Friday for movie night with the family. Sure enough, I had a crush on her brother and felt more sexual desire toward him than my own girlfriend. I ended up briefly ending that relationship. Fast forward a few years later and we're friends, so no hard feelings on that part.

Now here's the fun part! I've suffered from sleep paralysis as a child and had mild visual hallucinations. Now that I am older, I have spoken with many therapists and have been diagnosed with clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and insomnia... I have never told anyone about my hallucinations which occur to this day. Sometimes people get suspicious of me when I talk to somebody that I thought was there, though I normally just say that I have a habit of talking to myself. I obviously have been prescribed medicines for some of these things for which I gulp down every morning then head off to school and pretend that my life isn't in shambles.

Before I've got help for my problems, I used to cut myself daily. I have now scar ridden arms for which I may never wear a t-shirt in public again. These constant reminders of my worst state of mind will always keep me from having my best state of mind.

I'm a bisexual 14 y/o living with an ignorant and bigoted father. I have a fuckton of mental illnesses as well and hate my life.

46,"So after a very rough few days last week (see previous post) I finally decided to just go with the flow, instead of moping around and feeling sad, I chose to enjoy my own company again. 
To just be the me I knew was there, but weighed down by all the stress and shit I had been dealing with. I let go of some shit, I mourned the loss of other things, but overall I just kept telling myself to push forward. Iv'e been in this position before, and at times in a worse position than this, and I made it out 10x better than when I had started. I knew and know I will be ok. I always am. 

I went out on Friday with some good friends, laughed, joked and had an amazing time.
Got my motorcycle out on Saturday and went for a cruise, saw some more good friends, and enjoyed myself.
Took a day trip yesterday with some friends to East Lansing, which was incredible. Only downside to that, was that's where my ex lived. It was slightly odd being there and not having her around, and seeing all the places we would always go.
But! Making new memories there with friends I know I'll always have was nice. It was refreshing to not let my old memories of there get me down. 

I'm finally doing me again, and it fucking rules. 
I'm genuinely happy :)

Happy Monday everyone, go out and enjoy life, because it's pretty fucking rad!!",20Feb2017,3
50,"Today I was walking around the city when a middle-aged office worker approached me randomly and he tried to start a friendly conversation with me. It absolutely made my day!

So the backstory, I've been a closeted crossdresser for years, and I've never had the courage to walk around outside dressed up until a few months ago. I'd always worried that I wouldn't pass, and people would give me funny stares for being an ugly-looking drag queen walking around town.

So for years I've been stepping up my crossdressing game until I felt confident enough in my look. A few months ago, I decided that I looked good enough to pass, at least at a passing glance, so I decided to go out around for a walk. It was one of the most nerve-wracking experiences I've been through in a long time that I'll never forget.

Since then, I've been out dressed up a handful of times; today was maybe my 5th day around the city. And someone actually confronted me and started trying to pick me up! Unfortunately, I had to turn him down, as I'm still a straight male, but it was honest to god one of the most sincerely flattering moments of my life :)

Just thought I'd share a little achievement in my life with you all. Thanks for reading if you made it this far! In case you're curious, [this is what I was wearing](http://imgur.com/C9306np) today when it happened :)",20Feb2017,3
52,"Addiction is no stranger to us. Growing up in a house with an alcoholic for a father and an enabler for a mother, this home was never a happy one. So when dad decided to finally get sober, I thought that was the end of it. I thought that I would no longer have to deal with my life constantly falling apart at the seams due to somebody else's addiction. ... Until you started using crystal meth.

I would love to say that I understand. That I empathize. That I'm not angry. But I don't, and I am. I know I am being closed-minded and biased when I say this, but I don't get how you can keep telling us that being addicted to meth isn't a choice; that you can't help it. Maybe I'm just too focused on my own pain. In fact, I probably am. All I know is that I watched you watch our cousin go through a meth addiction. I heard, from you, all about how messed up it made him. I watched you look up effects and symptoms of it on the internet. 'Wow, isn't that crazy?' you'd said. So you CANNOT tell me that you didn't know what you were getting into or what you were doing when you snorted that shit up your nose for the first time.

It was a year of total hell. First you'd disappear for days at a time. Come home to shower, then be gone again an hour later. You stole my tablet, your son's tablet, multiple laptops. Cash. I don't like to focus too much on those things, though. Because despite all the things you stole, that wasn't the worst of it. Not by a long shot. The worst of it was when the delusions and the paranoia started to set in. The worst of it was when I could no longer feel safe in my own fucking home due to your psychotic behavior. When you blamed me for 'hacking your computer' and slandered me online. When you emotionally and verbally attacked me off and on. One day you'd be fine, the next you'd be going off on me all over again. The worst was when I was so anxious and so stressed and I felt SO stuck, I started self harming. I started seriously considering suicide. Fuck, I remember staring down a bottle of medication and seriously contemplating downing all of it. And you know what? I almost did. YOUR BEHAVIOR - YOUR ADDICTION - NEARLY DROVE ME TO SUICIDE. The fact that you have never once owned up to your behavior or apologized for any of it doesn't help, either. Maybe that's because you don't really know or understand just what you did to me or how you made me feel. 

Still, as angry as I was at you and as much as I hated you at that time, I never stopped caring. I never stopped wanting you to be better. And yeah, I had a hard time showing it, but I did fucking care. Crying when you were in the hospital, crying when you were at a fucking psych ward. Really, really wanting you to overcome everything. Wanting you to be my fucking sister again. You really DON'T know the hell you put me, or any of us, through.

And then you were sober. I mean, it was off and on, but eventually I stopped thinking you were going to slip back into old habits. I was able to relax. Until I started noticing old patters and old behaviors creeping in. You're using again; I don't need you to tell me, I can see it for myself. After EVERYTHING, after being sober for months, you're doing this shit again. And that isn't a CHOICE? You're telling me you didn't actively make a decision to pick that shit up and start putting it into your body? Again? Having first AND secondhand experience on what it does to your life?

I hope one day you realize that you don't need this fucking drug to be happy. That it's harming you more than it's helping you. I hope that you get better, and you stay better. I hope you don't end up like all those other drug addicts, homeless and abandoned by their families. I hope you pull your fucking life together and get a grip.

But I'm not holding my breath.",20Feb2017,20
53,"But don't worry, I hate everything exactly equally. I hate each individual atom of Abraham Lincoln's face as much as I do his bone structure, or any of the trees in the surounding 250 mile radius, or the book Mein Kamf, or the abstract idea of a snake made out of tofu.

Fuck everything, and may it suffer the greatest imaginable torment for eternity.
