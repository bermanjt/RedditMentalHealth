0,"Hi, just wanted to say that I have had many setbacks in my life. My parents are gone. A number of friends are gone. But eventually my experience has been that I only remember the good things that have happened and all, or most, of the setbacks fade into obscurity and are forgotten. 

It doesn't usually help to be told this, it sort of needs to happen first, but, from a 67 year old point of view you folks will be fine and anything negative that happens will be forgotten.",10Jun2017,967
3,"My parents made it VERY clear tonight that I was not ""allowed"" (parenthesis bc I have the power of choice) to go on a summer road trip across the country for 3 months next summer, even if I pay it 100% with my money. They presented me with an ultimatum where if I choose to do the trip they will cut me off financially, which includes my college and my car. I'm very blessed that they have been able to give me so much, but I don't know how I'd live with myself if I let a once in a lifetime opportunity slip through my fingers (cause when else are you able to just pick up and go other than your youth). Even with the stakes so high I'm still drawn toward doing it.",10Jun2017,1

7,"My family is known for being cautious and skeptical of everything. Making plans is a nightmare--they have to know every detail. If they're even a little suspicious of people I make plans with, I have to stay home. One time, I might've been thirteen, they made my sister come with me to get ice cream with a friend. It annoys me beyond belief, but I'm pretty spineless, so I deal with it by basically never doing anything. I understand that you can't take everything at face value, but I think that attitude's fucked me up. I'm anxious about everything now.

My last final exam let out today. My ride, my aunt, had plans, so I agreed to be picked up three hours after the final instead of straightaway. I went to go get lunch with a close friend, as a celebration type thing. We still had some time to kill, though, so we went to her house. She lived close, so it wasn't a big deal. It doesn't sound like much--hell, it isn't. I've known her for almost four years. I've been to her house before (though that was under my parent's conditions, kinda killed the fun). This time, though, it was better. My own anxiety killed the mood a little, but it was still better by a mile. I was making my own decisions. My parents would have flipped--walking too far south of my school does get you into rocky territory, and there have been reports of robberies around. But I was pretty careful. I wasn't walking alone, it wasn't dark, I wasn't on my phone, and there were people out. 

I didn't stay long, but it was long enough to watch shitty anime and eat some day-old sushi, and that's all I needed. I walked back, and I hung out at a park until my ride showed up. I pretended like nothing happened. In a way, nothing did, but I think I realize now that, while my parents have my best interests at heart, they're not always right.",10Jun2017,2
8,"Outlook couldn't get an outside connection, got a call saying her email couldn't connect. No problem, I just logged in via teamviewer, did some troubleshooting and figured that the issue was a router configuration problem.

Noticed that Skype was being port forwarded for some reason and that the modem/router security settings were set to ""medium"" and blocking bittorent clients as well as some other ports. 

Removed all of those settings, figuring they were set there by her ISP. Then she mentions in passing that her friends boyfriend does works in IT in some capacity as well and starts reading off the titles of books on his bookcase. Oops. Luckily I had the forethought to screenshot the port forwarding rules before I removed them in case anything breaks. Told her to call me before she leaves so I can change those settings back or her friend will probably be a bit annoyed.",10Jun2017,1
10,"All the cities and towns around here ban tobacco smoking and even e-cigarettes in parks. This is unreasonable because parks contain large open areas. People should be able to smoke somewhere out there, because it has practically no direct harmful effect on others.

I do think smoking cigarettes regularly is a bad thing which should be discouraged. But the idea that the police could stop and fine someone for smoking in a park just goes too far. It amounts to a violent response to a simple victimless act.

I do also feel that the criminal prohibition of pot is very wrong. I know this is a lesser kind of prohibition, via municipal ordinances. But someone it's more horrifying to see new unreasonable prohibitions like this appear.

Oh yeah, also alcohol is prohibited there. Like, you can't peacefully enjoy a beer in a park. That's totalitarian too. Now, chances are the police would just tell you to spill it, but still it seems wrong to involve violence in something like that. The message is comply or else we will try to enforce progressively worse consequences on you. Sure, the initial request might even be friendly but the fact it has the whole force of the state monopoly on violence behind it is what makes it seem wrong.

I have not smoked in many years, and I was never a regular smoker. This isn't about my rights, but about liberty in general.",10Jun2017,1
13,"This has really just happened. It is 5:35am, she just fucking left and I feel god damn terrible. 

So I have been hanging out with this guy for years now. And I know he is crazy about w is girl. 

Well tonight we all planned a night in my house. I got a load of red wine and cooked a nice meal. But my mate ended up having to go to work. The girlfriend still came. We were having a great time. I noticed for the first time that she has an awesome sense of humour. I felt like shit for thinking she is an awesome girl. 

Late at night, around 3am we were sat on the couch and she was constantly acting amazed by my music choices, saying she never met anyone that likes these particular brands. 

At this point even I was picking up on her signals, and I'm fucking useless at that. She was making a lot of physical contact. She said how amazing I am and how she wishes she's known me longer. She then kisses me on the cheek, says fuck it and then kissed me on the lips. 

A lot was going through my head. She is an incredibly good looking girl. I'm a terribly ugly guy that never would have dreamt of being in this situation with a girl like this. After all the fun mistakes we fell asleep holding each other on the couch. 

Her boyfriend, my mate called just about ten minutes ago to ask if she is ok. She got a taxi home soon after, even kisses me goodbye... I feel fucking terrible! I don't know wharf to do. I'm in deep shit you guys, I've become what I hate, a dirty cheat. I'm not ok right now.

16,"I hate when debating the existence of a God with people, their only source is a book that says their God exists. When telling them what kind of God would let all these people in the world suffer while I get to live a normal privileged life. What makes me special compared to them. It's bullshit. How can people be so gullible and afraid to swallow the truth. Their response is 'it's a test of faith' etc, or it doesn't matter what happens during life, it's the after life that matters, etc. No. Even if there was an afterlife, what kind of sick God would expect you to worship them when they doesn't even have the decency to give us equal lives.",10Jun2017,2
17,"One evening, I was sitting by the poolside at my friend Sarah’s. Sarah, a freshman in my university, was this lean, athletic, Asian American girl. She is also my crush. We’ve been flirty for the past couple of months. We’re a part of the same co-ed amateur wrestling club together. She was hosting a party at her place for the basketball playoffs.

Her Mom, Jade didn’t approve of us. Jade was this 40 year old mother that looked like she was in her late 20s. You could mistake her for one of those rich Asian students that would study abroad in America and have their parent’s checkbook. Reason why I say that is because she is high maintenance and loves fashion. So you’d see her dress up like she was Sarah’s sister. She acts like she's 20 and has so much makeup. I didn’t care. I thought maybe I can win her trust in the future. My focus was on Sarah.

I just got out of the hot tub with Sarah. We ended up sitting down near the fire to dry off. We ended up getting drinking and having a chat about wrestling. Sarah would bring up her mother and how she made a lot of men tap out. Jade was an MMA Instructor by day, but a Session Wrestler by night. She also visits our wrestling club on occasion to assist with coaching.

Session Wrestling is essentially a fetish job. Men or Women would schedule an appointment for a “wrestling match” with Jade where she just safely wrestles them for money. Everyone has their own thing and Sarah didn’t mind, so I didn’t judge her mother on her hobby.

I started getting drunk. I overdid it on the alcohol and would start talking a big game about myself. Sarah brought up her Mom’s favorite submission hold, the “Twisted Octopus.” And how she ends her sessions with that. I laughed and dismissed it as some badly named hentai from an anime. I also started saying things like *“Wrestling is fake. Plus, I would NEVER tap out to her. She’s so old!”*

Once I said that, I felt like I just made the biggest mistake of my life. Behind me, I see Sarah’s Mom Jade. She just freshly got out of the pool and only put on her wedge heels. She already didn’t like me, but I can tell she heard everything. In hindsight, I was drunk loud. 

I was told and quoted saying *“Sup Miss Bitch, I can take your octopus ass on.”*. I put my hand on her shoulder like a moron. Of course, I tripped on someone’s slipper and found myself on the ground. The alcohol was starting to take a toll on me, so I was getting groggy. Jade took this as an opportunity and a few seconds later, I found myself twisted and stretched out like a pretzel. She had me in this complicated hold where I was trapped and forced to do the splits. I was wearing a speedo too. This was not the time or place for something like this.

I figured she loved this hold because it was part painful and part humiliating. I was getting stretched out and humbled by some 40 year old Asian woman, fresh off the pool in a swimsuit and heels. *""This is the Twisted Octopus that you talked shit about. Now you're MY bitch. Time to make poor baby cry.""*

Sarah walked towards us. Her mother made sure to humiliate me some more. She started saying things like *“A lot of people pay good money for me to do this to them, but you’re getting it for free.” “You getting excited? You pervert.” “Respect your elders.”* At this point she was milking it. According to my other friends, she said my penis was small and I was weak in Chinese. Her inner Session Wrestler/Dominatrix was coming out and it was awkward.

I couldn't do anything about it. The guys weren't helping out. They laughed instead. The girls were either snapchating or recording this. They were encouraging girl power. Every time I try to escape, she just wrenches the hold. My legs were at an obtuse angle at this point. I'm not flexible. I'm trapped. You would think Sarah would stop it. But then again I did just call her Mom a bitch while I was drunk. I think she was still mad at me. She just said “Pathetic. Stretch him out, Mom.” And just walked back inside. The other people just started laughing. To make things worse, I tapped out to a camera to my face with my legs open, only wearing a speedo. I legit had to fight back tears from the embarrassment.

I ended up having a sore groin the next couple of days and had to have myself checked out at the doctors. It was embarrassing telling them the story. *“I got stretched out by my friend’s Mom.”* The clips of me being stretched out was sent on Snapchat to the other team. Quotes like *“Heard you got your ass whooped.” “LOL, I saw you get your legs spread by Ms. Jade in a swimsuit and heels! How scandalous” ""Dude you lost your macho card."" ""I just bought this cute dress, can I lock you in the banana splits in it?"" ""Did you just mess with me? I'll call Ms Jade again!"" ""Dude I bet Ms. Jade would kick your ass again in a rematch.""* 

My crush started distancing herself from me. I don’t know if it was my drunkness or if it was the fact that her Mom whooped my ass or if I called her a bitch. Due to my groin injury, I also had to lose out on a job opportunity at the Summer Camp since I can’t get too physical for a month, so I lost potential income. It was all because of alcohol and my stupidity. 

At this point what to do I do? Is my crush journey still salvageable? How do I come back to wrestling knowing that I got the biggest humiliation ever? Is it worth chasing my crush if her Mom's not on good terms with me? Or did I just dodge a bullet?

**TLDR**: Got drunk, called my crush’s Mom old. Crush’s Mom proceeds to stretch me out with a wrestling move in front of her. I end up losing my pride, losing my crush, left the wrestling team, lost a job opportunity, and bruised my groin with one drunk moment.

20,"So my friend and I, lets call him Red. So red and I went to a scenic hiking trail in our town. It has a lovely waterfall you can stand under, so we wanted to visit since it was beautiful out. We get there and passed 2 gentleman sitting at a picnic table, nothing out of the ordinary. We greet each other with hellos and I asked if they come here often, they reply yes so i ask what trail they suggest we go on ( they split 4 or 5 different paths) and they suggested a pathway i can't recall as of right now. Anyways, red and I do our hike, visit the waterfall and we head back. We notice one of the guys we first saw was hanging around my car. I figured at first he wanted feedback on how the hike went. So red and I walk up to our respective doors and we're about to get in when he approaches us.. I make small talk while i notice red bent down to tie his shoes, nothing out of the ordinary.. Then i notice the gentleman's hand moving by his crotch.. I take a peek and notice he has his penis outside his pants and he was pleasuring himself while casually having a conversation with me! I look over to red and say get in the fucking car now. So we get in the car, I reverse as fast as possible and i notice 2 city workers beside us. I roll my window down and alert them as to what just happened. Now as i was talking to the city workers, the man booked it in his truck and sped off. I managed to pull my phone out asafp and tried snapping a pic of his license plate to send to the police. Unfortunately he was too far ahead and the picture came out blurry, so it looks like we have nothing to catch this fucking pervert.. Ugh. And when i explain to my family what happened, they shrugged it off as if its normal and to get over it. Like what the Fuck, i feel like absolute sick to my stomach, and have been all night.

21,"**Balancing** in movies may not be as important as it is in video games, but when characters are out-of-balance, it's a detriment to the believability of the action and the universe depicted. 

Iron Man in the Marvel superhero movies is a bad example for this, in my book. 

Instead of making him this near-invincible quasi Superman that makes him look like some out-of-this-world piece of unbelievably high-powered unbelievably high-precision and unbelievably high-durability piece of ***alien*** tech, I for one would have made Iron Man a sort of ***wannabe super-hero*** who struggles to keep up with the 'big guys' like Thor or the Hulk who're tapping into more or less mysterious forces to receive their uncanny capabilities. Whereas Iron Man is just a regular human who throws money and Silicon-Valley-grade 'high-tech' at the problem, and consequently is continually facing system errors, fuel/energy shortages, malfunctions and other such nuisances, and often at the wrongest moment possible! Combined with being a lot weaker altogether. 'Wait, guys! I gotta put my armor on! :struggles putting on his Iron boots:' 

*That* would have made for a much more interesting 'underdog' character and would have also provided a nice friction between Tony Stark's entrepreneurial hubris and his continual humiliation of only barely being able to stack up. ",10Jun2017,1
22,"So long story short, yesterday while unloading our truck at work, I hurt my wrist somehow. I didn't notice until I tried lifting a few more things and I noticed a sharp pain on the outer part of my left wrist, like where the little bone sticks out. A few minutes later it started hurting all the time, instead of just when I lifted something. I could still move it and it really didn't swell so I wrapped it and my boss put in an incident report in the event I went to the doctor for workman's comp.

Fast forward to today and it still hasn't bruised, I can still move it and the swelling really isn't much more than minimal at most. There's a little bit of pain but it's more in my hand, like in the palm area, rather than my wrist. It also hurts to make a fist, like my fingers are stiff or something.

Even though the company will pay my medical bills, I don't want to waste the doctor's time or be in the way of of genuinely sick or injured person's ability to see the doctor for something that's probably just a sore muscle. 

I know this isn't a place to ask for a diagnosis and I don't want one, I'm just curious if anyone else has had an injury like this.",10Jun2017,0

29,"At about 1am Friday morning my wife woke me up and we rushed to a nearby hospital that my sister-in-law OD'd on her antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds and was being airlifted to from her home that is over 122 miles away by car. We got there before SIL arrived. We were also allowed to walk with the doctors monitoring her vitals (they had induced unconciousness with Propofol) to her room in the ICU. It was surreal seeing her unconciousness and all hooked up to lofe support and on a breathing tube.

We asked what the lead doc thought about her recovery, and he was reluctant to give us a clear answer, saying because they didn't know exactly what pills she took, and, mowt importantly, how many, thqt there was no way to know just yet, and that they were just focusing on counteracting the effects of what they knew were inside of her until she was out of the woods.

Once her husband and my in laws showed up, her husband explained that she had gottwn up in thw middle of the night (he assumed to go to the bathroom), and a short time later he heard a loud thump from upstairs. He went to investigate and found her lying down on the kitchen floor; she told him she took a bottle of pills, and he tried to help her half walk to his truck so he could rush her to the neareet medical center (they live in a very rural area, so it can be quicker to speed straight there than wait for an ambulance to get to your house and then return), but her muscles started to seize up when they got to the doorway, and she had a seizure at least during the ambulance ride.

We all stayed with her for about 6 hours after we were let into the iCU at around 3am until the medical staff told us they needed more room to be able to properly work on her. By that time the Clonus she was experiencing had dropped dramatically (which the docs said was good), with the foot test only showing some weak pulses instead of the strong continuous rhythmic pulses she had when first in the iCU.

My wife and I left since we only live about 15 mins away compared to 2+ hours for in laws and husband, and the news we've gotten so far is that SIL's vitals are still good, they took her off the medications they used to coubteract the meds she oD'd on, and they will wake her up tomorrow.

We don't know if there is lasting damage, but it sounds like she is out of the woods and will survive. She seized for something like 20ish minutes, which is dangerously close to the 30 minute mark that causes brain damage. Currently my wife and i are celebrating our 1 year anniversary this weekend in Duluth, but sans both my MIL (her cancer treatments make her susceptible to catching illness. She found out she had cancer maybe a month or so ago), and now SIL, who were both going to be with us for certain fun parts. We're gonna do our best to enjoy our time in spite of the situation, as per our Mil's request. We can't do anything to help, and we will be coming back Sunday to try and be there for when they wake SIL up. In the meantime we're going to keep an eye out for anything ahe might want from the rummage sale, and of course any Hannah Montana paraphernalia (her least favorite show and character ever).

I hope she makes it through this, and i hope we can give her the aupport she needs to find a new method of coping or a new treatment for her depression.

It seemed like I couldn't do anything without having my hand smacked for not doing it the way they wanted it that day. Always something to say about something. Not to mention the poor management... both managers make more and work less than anyone else. Leaving early, hour long lunches with family on company time, stealing from the store, etc.

39,"Hi Guys. Dont know if this is the right subreddit but i just feel like i could need someone to talk to :)
So who am i? 
22 years old male, living in europe as a child of migrants, going to university to become a teacher, single.
Basically for about 1 year now, i have this constant feeling of anxiety, restlessness and just a general feeling of unhappines. 
I used to be a really insecure till i was about 20 years old, which means i never went out with my friends when we were at the age where everyone starts going to clubs and bars. I always ahd a good bunch of friends, actually they were always the popular kids too and they always urged me to come with them.
most of my insecurity comes/came from a birth condition called ptosos, which basically means that i dont have a muscle to lif tmy eyelid, so i look pretty tired most of the time, which makes me feel pretty ugly, altough i am probably pretty average since i got an operation to fix it at least a little bit. Besides that i am also pretty muscular.
Because of that i was always afraid of girls, till a coworker started flirting with me when i was 20 and i was like ""fuck it might as well loose my virginity to just anyone""
sicne then i am not really afraid of approaching girls anymore and hooking up is not that much of a problem , altough i have never had a girlfriend.

Basically what i want to say is that if my 14 year old me knew that i was going to become the person who i am today, he would be really happy. but i am not. 
Nothing really fullfills me and i dont know what would do it longterm.
Also i am doing nofap because i am kinda pornaddicted and got erection issues. I dont believe in the hole nofap philosophie crap. i know that my erection issues come from my anxiety and the fact that i cant relax during sex, but i guess slowing down on masturbation cant be bad. The only problem is that i always fall into a deep low when i ""relapse"", which is one of the reasons i also hate nofap haha.

I also know that no other person could love (in a romantic way) as long as i cant love myself, but to be quite honest with you i just dont feel like i deserve it. Everytime i hook up with a girl, all i can think about is what might be wrong with that girl and what in the hell she actually sees in me. 

i also always had a really loving family, My mother died when i was 9 and i think i always dealed with in a pretty good way, sicne i really enjoy talking about her and looking at pictures of her and stuff.
Also my best friend always tries to lift me up for which i am really thankful.

All i want i to learn to let go of all these negative thoughts. but i just cant stop bathing in my fears and insecurities. I also dont think the i am clinicaly depressed, since i dont have any real symptoms. i am just dissatisfied constantly for no reason but by own insecurities

I dont know if you get what i am trying to say, since i am really bad at writing my houghts down. ",10Jun2017,3
41,"So I woke up at 8:00 this morning after having got in from a concert at about 4:00- I was, and to an extent still am, hungover completely beyond thought, but I had to catch a charter bus four hours up the eastern seaboard at 10:00 and I couldn't get the reservation changed because it's my parents money and they're becoming impatient with me.  The story there is I'm trying to sublet a room from a couple of friends whom they *hate* and so my mother has been handing down ultimatum after ultimatum for the past week to the effect that if I waffle as regards my trip over they're going to cancel my tickets and demand my friend repay my rent money and trap me in the suburbs for the rest of my life- which puts me on a slightly precarious schedule, and I'm having to be diplomatic in several different directions, because here's the trouble: this sublet is technically illegal, so the friends of mine letting their apartment don't feel remotely under any obligation to be prompt or hospitable, meaning my room's completely unfurnished at the moment and in order to avoid sleeping on the floor for the next week I've had to reserve another bus, heading another several hours through several million other provincial New England fuckholes, so I can stay with another put-upon friend of mine for a week until the apartment's been sorted out.

In aid of which I've spent the past six hours shuffling through bus depots hauling this idiotically massive canvas bag full of everything I own because I hadn't had the presence of mind this morning to pack a rolling suitcase- rather than the most ergonomically incorrect burlap orphan sack in the world, which was what I did.  I'm sore, I'm hungry, I'm broke- and I lost my makeup bag at the bar last night, so I don't even look especially hot.  At the moment I'm sitting at an idiot fresh foods cafe in the middle of nowhere, which is blasting idiot spunky techno at full volume, and the setting sun is creeping into my hiding place at the cornermost cafe table, and I'm so viciously hungover that every kind of stimulus strikes me as a personal attack, and I only want to get home- by which I mean I'd like to get anywhere where I can drop my luggage and collapse, and I want somebody to appear to *care* that this whole series of displacements has been profoundly stressful and alienating, but I'm doing my best to keep up a constructive attitude to it.",10Jun2017,3

43,"I'm gay, but I'm not gay enough.

I come from a huge conservative family that, just five or six years ago, would have ostracized anyone in the family who wasn't straight.  I actually think this has happened in the past, and I just don't know about it because no one talks about those people, they were totally shunned.

But just last year, a nephew of mine (a first cousin once removed), who is 16, came out to the family.  And everyone cried and supported him and hugged him and all that at Thanksgiving.

Why?  Because *DUH* he's gay.  His coming out was no surprise.  The entire family had about a decade to prepare for it.  This guy is like food network, theater production, sassy limp-wrist gay, like a supporting character from a bad rom-com.  (I know this sounds mean, but the dude is super sweet and cool and he would laugh at this description of him, that's just his sense of humor).

I'm proud of my family for supporting him, proud of him for coming out, proud that this isn't really a big deal.

But if I came out?  Man, that would be a different story.  I'm one of the guys, you know.  I've even had a girlfriend that I've introduced my family to in the past.  It would be *really* weird and uncomfortable if I came out, because it really would be a shock, unlike with my nephew.

And this goes beyond my conservative family.  I've got a group of friends at work (fyi, I'm 21), one of whom is gay and who started talking about his boyfriend the day we met.  Obviously everyone is cool with it, we're all ~20, it's 2017, and we live in urban California.  It's not even something you think about twice.

If we were all getting lunch on the weekend and I dropped a line like ""maybe I should bring my boyfriend next time,"" it would be really unexpected.  Not nearly as bad as with my conservative family.  But even with trendy young 20-somethings who don't think twice about lgbt people, if someone is very unexpectedly gay, there would be that small moment of surprise and awkwardness, as everyone searches their memory through our every interaction together to see if they could remember any hints or tells that I might be gay.  That moment would be over forever in about 30 seconds and everything would be fine after that.  But I'm already awkward enough, so I can't bring myself to breach that barrier and endure that extra-awkward moment.",10Jun2017,5

45,"My professional life is crap, I have no friends, my love life is nonexistent, I'm generally in a bad mood most of the time. I'm not suicidal, but I often wonder if life is worth anything to me.

But when I'm four miles into a run, one foot in front of another, the warm air hugging me, no shortage of endorphins, I feel like everything is fine. In the moment, I'm exactly where I should be, doing what I ought to. Nothing, and no one, on this planet has given me as much as running. Setting a personal record on a sunny day, surrounded only by the earth's creations, is truly beautiful.

46,"I got an interview that's on a day off for the photograph company. 
The person on the phone told me everything and despite knowing that it was a sales position, I thought I could wear casual clothes there so I didn't think it matter until I had to wear business casual for the interview. 
I spent the whole night panicking because the contact number was at the business and since it's a day they're not working, the phone doesn't work. 
The next morning, I was reviewing what she told me and found out that I had a sales job and I freaked out because I don't have business casual clothes whatsoever and all my clothes are for going out, and I don't have makeup. So I asked a lot of people and they told me since the interviewer will wait for me, i should go there and tell them I can't do the job. However i still emailed them through the email I found on the website and i didn't even know that it would work, so in 20 Minutes, i went to the place and found that the interviewer didn't come, the email worked!
The email I had sent was "" I am sorry and didn't want to make a bad impression"" I was too honest. 
And about more than 3 hours, they sent me a message if I would like to reschedule and I can call them with the office number and I didn't think it would work since it's the day off. But what happened was the interviewer called me and asked me if I would like to reschedule or I'm no longer interested and then I told them this with a sluggish and ""...uhhhh, yeah, I'm not really, yeahhhhh...."" and the interviewer told me ""okay well thank you for calling"" and I answered back nmmnmmnnnthank..yo"" the call hung up. 
Now I'm panicking if I should call them back explaining everything because I got the interview how I wanted and I contacted them not to go before 20 to the interview and then sent them an email that hinted I was unsure of the scheduling or not interested and when they called me, I was speaking rather guiltily, I don't know. Please could anyone tell me what I did wrong? ",10Jun2017,4

48,"To the people who follow white supremacist ideas writing articles, holding debates, voting, running for office etc. All the methods of intellectual battle that are normally used in a democratic and free society are wholly ineffective in trying to diffuse the spread of these ideals. It makes me incredibly depressed because it seems impossible to stop people who feel victimized for whatever reason (no matter how unfounded) from turning to these dangerous ideologies. What can be done??",10Jun2017,2
