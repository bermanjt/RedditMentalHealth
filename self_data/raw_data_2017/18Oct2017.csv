3,"huge probability i am overthinking but try convincing my mind that
friday i got dumb high on marijuana with a friend it was only us two
we chilled in mcdonald's for a few hours
i remember making wack jokes, trembling, speaking to myself, just the regular shit high people do, but i don't remember a huge portion of my night
i think i weirded him out, he wont speak to me anymore
my greatest fear is that my unconscious mind is homosexual and that i acted in such a manner with him, if he is just pissed off cause i was being retarded and maybe said a few retarded things to him, idgaf, he has iust not responded so far after my few attempts to phone/ message him, only telling me ya on text like im some sort of bitch
i probably was acting like one, but if that is all i did idgaf, if in my weed fuelled retardation i hit on him in a gay manner then my reputation and life is tarnished and I will have to move somewhere else, i make part of a society of recent immigrants and we are all including me not tolerant of any of that, and if i a'm that i have no trouble ending my own life honoroubly
i know consciously i am straight, but it is said weed reveals who you really are, and if i am really gay then i dont know what to think, i am repulsed by homosexual behaviour sober and i dont remember anything different high
i might have done something which seemed gay but that is far enough 
can a sane person help me out, and embracing gayness is not an option",18Oct2017,0

7,"When I think of things that make me happy,  I think of when I starred in a play, getting high grades, winning a video game, telling a good joke, and of smiles my way or a hug I didn't initiate.  It feels like I do everything to impress other people.  Even this current epiphany of emotional awareness is a huge boost to my self-confidence.  I don't seek these things out intentionally -- I feel automatically drawn towards these things, or I react without thinking in a way that shifts attention towards myself, and it works.  I'm worried that this automatic instinct will eventually alienate me from others, or leave me unsatisfied for my whole life.  How can I change, how can I utilize my ego, or how can I stabilize my natural desire for awe?",18Oct2017,1
11,"A little over a year ago I met my girlfriend. She had just moved from across the country with her family. We both worked at the same place and we started to hit it off. 

Early on in our relationship, my girlfriend was having issues with her controlling parents, and decided that she was making enough money to live on her own. Her parents were not happy with her decision and tried to make her move as hard as possible. 

In the end, her parents ripped her off by ""allowing [their] daughter to buy a $500 dollar junker car off them for over $2000 dollars (her entire savings)."" She needed a car for work and felt like she had no choice but to buy the car from her parents. And started out her first days alone with less than $30.  

She rented a room for a month in the house of a nice old couple that lived in a bad part of town. At the end of her first month in the house, one of my roommates moved to a new place and I asked her if she wanted to rent out the extra room at my place.

She accepted and next thing you know we are living together. A month after we were living together, our work started cutting the hours of all its employees and we were both only working a max of 20 hours a week. I still had some savings so i wasn't feeling the cutback as bad as her. 

The first month of cutbacks were really hard on her. She lost her first check of the month to rent, and was really struggling for money. I tried to help, but my savings was not enough to support us both. She kept looking for jobs, but nobody was hiring in our town, and her car wasn't good enough to drive to the nearest city. 

She became really desperate for money and I jokingly told her to find a sugar daddy on craigslist. She came from a christian household and was unfamiliar with the concept of sugar daddies. I told her that most sugar daddies pay for your dates/clothes/rent for dating them, but they usually wanted to sex.
She told me that she wasn't interested in having sex with anyone. 

After I told her about craigslist, she started seeing posts that would offer money for nude photos.
She found a craigslist ad that advertised $250 dollars/week for nude photos that would be sent at random times throughout the week. After emailing the advertiser for a week behind my back, she went to meet him at a restaurant in a hotel lobby and discuss how she will be paid and when the pictures should be delivered to him.  

My girlfriend then went to meet up with this man without telling me. I later discovered that she went to the restaurant, and the guy came up and hugged her after she put out her hand for a handshake. 

She said at that moment she felt really creeped out by the guy, and she felt guilty for even meeting up with the guy in the first place. 

She left the hotel before the waitress was able to come back with the drinks and called me. I could tell something was off, but i didn't think much of it. When she got home I asked her what happened and she made up a lie and told me that she went and hung out with her sister. 

I found out about her encounter with the man a month later.I saw the texts between them when they were talking about meeting at the restaurant in the hotel. Followed by him texting her for weeks asking if she still wanted to do the deal. I questioned my girlfriend about the texts and she completely broke down and told me that she couldn't find a way to tell me about meeting with the man.

I was angry and sad, and told her that I needed a break. After two weeks of talking about everything that happened, I felt that she had made a mistake and that I would take one more chance on our relationship. 

It's been 6 months since I took the chance, and she has won a lot of my trust back. We have talked a lot about the incident since then and I feel like we are both dedicated to making the relationship last. I feel like my trust issues come and go. I've gone months in our relationship without being affected by them. But occasionally I will start thinking ""what if I can't trust her."" When that happens we will usually talk and I tell her how i'm feeling. 

She tells me that she regrets what she did. And I believe she means it. She is also there for me when I need to talk to her about it, and she hasn't done anything to betray my trust these past 6 months. 

I'm just hoping that our trust issues will continue to fade with time, and one day never resurface.

14,I'm a man in my early 20s and I'm kind of in love with a man who works in the same office as me; in a different department. We've never formally met. I'm so blown away by everything about him but our lives just never intertwine or overlap. I know this is a stupid cliché but it has become difficult going to work with this distraction.

21,"So I threw a pen at my secondary monitor, and now it still works but has giant lines covering parts of the screen. Still usable, I'm not going to though.

i'm not going to go into specifics because of how ridiculous it is, but its not actually anything to do with me. 

Its actually worrying when something so small, something that doesn't affect my personal life at all gets me that pissed off.

Also got a hole in my door, and broke my desk, shit that sounds bad doesn't it.

22,"I see so many people posting on here asking for advice about anxiety or depression.  It seems like the answer is so simple, but nobody wants to hear it..

It seems like a lot of people expect something to happen to them. Maybe they expect meditation to give them happiness... Or they expect someone to give them advice that will decipher their problems.  Also I think a lot of people expect that stability should sort of just come to them in their lives.  It seems like a big part of the answer is so simple, but nobody wants to hear it... The only way to solve your anxieties and problems is to mentally take responsibility for how you are feeling.  To sort of 'sit with the pain.'  This is an awesome thing.  You will get through it, and this is lasting change.  

A big part of happiness is getting past demanding it, getting past ego.  Letting go.  It's not a big deal, guys.  I'm not saying that what anyone is doing is wrong.  It's not a big change or anything.  This is just a cool mental approach you can use.  We always hear about letting go of ego.  Its not a complicated thing.   This is something that can only be done by us.  It's a simple, conscious decision that we make with ourselves to take responsibility for our own being and mind.  We say, ""Whatever comes, if I feel happy or sad, it's in my mind, and I can find a way to make it better myself.""  A lot of therapists talk about overcoming ego, but what they really want is the patient to keep being attached to them.  Trust me if you do this, calmness will start to come in more and more.  You will get to a really awesome place.

YOU MUST DO THIS!!!!!!",18Oct2017,28
23,"We became best friends in high school doing everything together. We went to separate Universities but still stayed in touch. When I finished school he was still in school and took a different route. HIs group of friends got into doing hard drugs they were no longer just drinking. I hung out a few more times but it wasn't the same anymore. We would have good laughs of the past but thats all that felt like was holding our friendship together. 

In high school when our group of friends got into hard drugs we both left the group together and started hanging out with our team mates. I did the same to him, I hung out with my other friends. 

He messaged me on facebook a few months before we reconnected and caught each other up with where we were in life. I left the last message open and didn't respond. He messaged me again asking to hang out. I held too much resentment from his drug use to see him and ignored it. About 6 months ago I saw in the paper he had taken his life 4 months before then. 4 months was only a few weeks before the last message he had sent me. 

I could be wrong in it all but I wonder if I had just responded. Went for a beer with him. Hung out with him. Things could have been completely different. I am too stuck in my ways. It kills me to think this way. Life is too short, I really wish I had just responded. ",18Oct2017,166
24,"I'm a guy, I'm 20, I'm not happy. I'm not unhappy either. 

I live in a country which isn't my own. I moved to France a year ago to study philosophy. Why? I genuinely don't know... I had the opportunity and I took it, thinking that even if it went wrong I'd learn something.
 
Settling in was hard, I have not really been able to make friends, and I just feel like I am not able to be myself in French. I speak well and am fluent, nevertheless I feel alienated from myself every time I have to interact in French. 

This year, I started a double major: Philosophy + film studies (since my passion has always been film). I thought things would go better if I did this, and they actually are, but I still feel like something is missing. 

I've made a couple of acquaintances with whom I sometimes hang out, laugh, and drink. Yet I still don't feel comfortable. It's really weird living in a language in which I don't feel at ease, and my French has gotten better ever since I moved here... I don't want to be one of those people who move somewhere else and just hang out with people who speak their same first language...


So... I'm studying something I like, I'm living in a good apartment, and I am relatively healthy, I have a couple of friends and I slowly adapt to my new life... Why do I still feel like something is missing? What am I missing? Most importantly, why can't I see what I'm missing to be happy?

25,"So around 10 years ago a friend and I were up late, drunk and surfing the old interweb. I think the site was nothingtoxic.com but I can't be sure.

We found a video of a group of naked asian men cowering and an army looking Asian man. So one of the men was told to stand with his hands on the wall. The army guy swung a plank that seemed to be 20 feet long and caught the naked guy right on the butt. He proceeded to jump around in agony.

We still talk about that video and I'd love to find it and send it to him 10 years later. Anyone ever seen this video or know where to find it?

Thanks",18Oct2017,2
28,"Trying to keep this as simple as possible but this issue is 6 months old and has layers. I bought a Chevy Colorado new (in NC) and immediately in the first week noticed I have to hold the wheel slightly left to make the truck go straight. If I straighten the wheel the truck will make a very aggressive right lane change. I brought the truck in at 30 miles and I got a plethora of reasons such as ""We load the shocks on transport and takes 1000 miles for it to settle"" and ""the roads have crowning so the wheel will correlate to that""  
So I initially agreed that was reasonable but brought it back because it never got better. Chevy worked on it twice and told me there was nothing they can do and the problem is me. Annoyed I left because they refused to take it in again. Fast forward a couple months and I'm at the mileage for my first oil change and tire rotation. Got the truck back and bam I now have to hold the wheel left much more to make it go straight. I take it back and they align the truck and it goes back to how it was with only slightly left.  
Now the problem has grown to be that any time we touch the suspension I'll need an alignment because something is off. I bring the truck back over and over until I'm told they have replaced EVERYTHING related to the steering and it's still doing it until I bring it back for the umpteenth the manager again tells me the problem is me and not the truck. But refuses to test drive it with me to show him the problem. I contacted Chevy customer care and they deal with the truck for 2 weeks and tell me that if the shop can't fix the truck I'll have to live with the problem.  
The next day after being told this I'm in the truck with my S/O and it starts violently shaking and the gauges go crazy forcing me off the road. I start driving and no shaking, it happens once later but as far as I know is random.  
So I bring it back to Chevy and explain the problem they agree to look at it. The next day I get a call from Chevy customer care and they explain to me what is going to happen. Here are the main points.  
- The regional owner has driven the truck and does not see any problems and the steering problem is crowning on the road.  
- They will not service my truck further and will not perform any warranty work on my truck  
- Nothing can be done and until my issues make the truck inoperable or causes me to wreck they will not look into any further claims on the truck  
- I consented when I brought the truck that it was constructed from new lightweight materials which can cause the truck to shake and steering to be flawed which is a ""characteristic"" of the truck and there fore they are not responsible for.  
Being mad I went to pick up my truck and demanded a test drive to show the problems, the manager said he was busy and sent a tech with me. The tech acknowledges and sees the steering problem, he calls the manager and the manager says again he is too busy but will drive it tomorrow, but he allows me to test drive another Colorado to convince me the problem is me. To not my surprise, the test drive Colorado does not have these steering issues. The next day comes around and the Manager calls me and states the person that rode with me is not qualified to diagnose the steering problem, there is no problem, and his owner said he can not test drive the truck or work on it. The reason when I asked why is that I was ""rude"" about working with them on the issue, no exaggeration that was the reason.   
  
The kick to all of this is the Sales manager who sold me the truck has been very compassionate and insistent to the Service manager and Owner I need a replacement truck which they tell the sales manager there is no problem so they don't have to do anything. The sales manager has offered me to trade in my truck for another one with a slight price change, but was told Chevy wont service or do warranty work on the new truck either.
  
I have no idea what to do going forward, It feels like Chevy has blacklisted me. My S/O will not ride in the truck because they feel unsafe and so do I, but I have to work so what other choice do I have.   
  
TL;DR: Chevy is denying my truck has a problem and is refusing warranty maintenance. Should I lawyer up, hit the gym, and delete facebook?",18Oct2017,3
29,"We had been close friends for a while, then we started flirting a little, here and there. The way we looked at one another; the light brush of skin as we walked together; the way we always lingered a beat too long after a goodbye; it had all led up to a warm summer night in the park last night.

A jungle gym was set up on a hill overlooking the city. We played around for an hour or so, flirting mercilessly and picking on each other. Then she took off toward the jungle gym and I gave chase. I cut her off in the spire at the top of the stairs, blocking her escape. She smiled and turned away from me, headed back the other way.

I reached down and grabbed her hand and said, “Hey, where do you think you’re going?”

She turned to me and said, “Wherever you want me to go.” Her chest touched mine and she looked up into my eyes.
I looked into hers and whispered, “I want you to go wherever you’re happiest.”

She smiled and said, “I’m already there.”

That’s when she put her hand to my face and pulled me into her. I’ll never forget the smell of her perfume; the feel of her hand in mine; her skin to my skin; the soft, wet, warm press of her lips, or the sweetness of their taste; the gentle lick of her tongue; her breasts against me; or the way her hair felt when I ran my fingers through it to the back of her head. I’ll never forgot how we lost ourselves in one another, or how long we let ourselves linger there (one beat too long, just as always).

It wasn’t long after that, and I got, not only a second kiss, but my third, my fourth, and my fifth.",18Oct2017,111

33,"A bit over two months ago I realized how shit my life actually is, I barely have any friends, only one and we’re not even that close, and I’ve never had a relationship despite being already 22. I’m close to finishing my Bachelor and although I want to continue with a Master programme I feel I’ve not only wasted my highschool but also my college time. Since then I’ve tried to make an effort to eat healthy and finally lose weight. It does work, I’ve lost around 20 lbs since then, still around 80 to go though, and while I feel a bit better physically, mentally I don’t think I’ve ever felt worse.

I feel like I’ve missed out on so much, in highschool I had barely any friends, only a couple of people I got along with well at school but no one ever invited me to anything or wanted to associate with me outside of it. Same in college really, it’s not like I alienate people or anything, I get along well with most of them, but still no one ever invites me to do anything outside of class and it’s simply frustrating. I’m not much of a social person anyway, generally I prefer being alone to read a book, or watch a movie but I’d still have enjoyed doing stuff with others occasionally. Knowing that others are having fun at parties and hook up with each other or at bars with their friends or wherever while I’m always all by myself feels depressing. I guess this is mostly my fault too, I’m not the most outgoing person in general and I’ve always felt very self-conscious because of my weight.

The other point is that I’ve never had a girlfriend. Most guys seem to have their first relationship in highschool, meanwhile I’ve pretty much finished my Bachelor and still haven’t had one. Knowing that I’m so far behind everyone, that almost everyone my age has had at least one, often more, relationships and at least somewhat of a social circle and that I will never know what it’s like to experience love at that age feels incredibly depressing. Then I’m also worried that even if I lose weight and get fit I still won’t find a girlfriend, first of all because I’m short, I’m only 5’6’’, and most girls seem to prefer tall guys, and of course no girl wants to date a virgin because a lack of relationships is usually seen as a red flag. I get that because if you’re a normal person you’d usually have had a relationship at that age so if that’s not the case it’s normal to wonder why. It’s not something that I’d have to openly say or anything but I bet most women pick up on it, if you’re inexperienced with women. So at that rate I’m honestly really scared because of the reasons I’ve stated that I’ll never find someone.

In the last months I've felt increasingly lonely, I don't need a huge social circle but I wish I had a couple of close friends and a girlfriend. I keep thinking that my life would’ve been much better if I never had been fat in the first place. I had a lot of health problems when I was younger that contributed to it becoming a problem but I’d still mostly blame myself because I barely made any effort to improve until recently. But now I feel like it’s almost too late, that I’ve missed out on too much that I can never experience and that I’ll probably never find a girlfriend, even if I lose weight and get fit, because of what I said above. That thought really depresses me and I keep constantly worrying about it even though there isn’t really anything I can do to change it. I also have no one in real life I can openly talk to about this so I decided to post this instead. I realize it’s not very interesting but for me it still felt a bit liberating to write about this.",18Oct2017,1
34,"I live in small town (southern Ontario), where I'm fairly involved in the community and work on charity and social programs. Lots of my family lives here, and overall it's a beautiful place to be, and I would have plenty of success here in the future.

There are issues with my immediate family, and I live on the other side of town set boundaries and things have been better. Many of my best friends have moved out west. I had a bad breakup 6 months back and now my ex has passed away accidentally. I feel like it's time for a change and to start fresh. Money is tight, but I don't care. I'm looking for people's opinions on this matter and who have perhaps done this, and what positive/negative experiences they may have had. I'm scared.",18Oct2017,10
36,"For whatever reason some old list of ""hard truths"" popped into my head, so I went online, dug it up, and read it over in my shaky, anxious state. I'm a little impressed with how many I could dismiss - many because they're closer to ""harsh possibilities"", or even better, ""dark thoughts"", the kind that slip into your mind and haunt you even if they're not true, don't matter, or aren't as severe as they sound. Things like ""You'll always hurt the people you love"",""Nothing you do matters because you don't matter"", ""You will make resolutions and continue to fail"", ""The only things you're destined for are failure and death"". And a big one: ""Life is a grand adventure that you all the good parts of"" (a lifelong frustration). 

Meanwhile, out there is the rest of the world, not living these things, or certainly not living them so permanently. Why not me, why can't I have a little of it? Sure, most of the time I think that these kinds of things are true, not because they're universal truths but because *I'm me*. Some harsh truth that I'm a worthless unlovable failure sounds rather like what I tell myself all the time, and I believe I'm correct in my assessment - but it's hardly true of others. I'm fairly sure if you told a successful business owner with a devoted and close-knit family that they constantly hurt their loved ones or are doomed to fail they'd laugh in your face (though another entry was ""You can never know what your loved ones think of you"", and ""Your loved ones would change something about you if they could"", with the obvious implication that the people you are about secretly hate you. Because that's totally universally true, I think as I observe couples and online relationships who have their disagreements and irritations but are otherwise quite content).

I'll cut my rambling short and get to the point: I've seen it elsewhere too. People boasting their presentation of ""harsh truths"" that 90% of the time are just plain cynical projection and the other 10% are existential things well-discussed in philosophy. And of course, there's never any solution offered - I guess you're just supposed to sit there for the rest of your life, don't bother doing anything, definitely don't love or care about anyone (it's the best way to get hurt after all - just ignore all the positive possibilities, or the worthiness of that pain), don't do anything because everything sucks and you suck.  What's the good of telling someone some esoteric truth if you don't also add how to adapt to it? Of course, if that ""truth"" is nothing more than your projected frustration or a crafted put-down, what good is it?

And one last thing...I can't help but feel like there's too much in the world to wallow in hopeless frustration about love not existing or dreams being doomed to die and fail. Sure, there's disappointment, but it's just part of everything that's *out there*. Only, like one of the quotes, I seem to miss all the best parts of life, or even lack much in the way of life at all. All the interesting stuff happens to and is done by everyone else and I'm just here confused on the sidelines. Holy shit this got long, I must be more agitated than I thought.

**EDIT**: Added that the comments in the first paragraph are best thought of as ""dark thoughts"" rather than harsh truths. More importantly, shall I assume that the upvotes mean people agree or feel the same way? I'm fucking sad and wanted to feel better, thanks. :)",18Oct2017,118
37,"I know myself. I recognize my limitations and intentions (or lack thereof). The problem is that it doesn't measure up on any level in means of relative ""success"". I've let myself fall to the depths of depression and anxiety has ruled my life for as long as I can remember. I couldn't possibly fathom being anyone else or any other way. To even make an attempt of improving myself, showing confidence, or portraying what a ""man"" actually is in society's eyes just makes me feel like a pathetic liar. I trash on myself because it's easy and what I recognize as truth. I'm only at peace and feel that I can be my true self when I'm completely alone. When in anyone's company, I just feel like shit or that I shouldn't be there at all.

I used to wish I was normal. But now, I realize that's only a silly dream. I'm set in these self-destructive ways and there's nothing left to do but ride out this half-life until its end.

And I've been given all of the advice. ""Don't worry so much"", ""Find a hobby"", ""Work out"", ""You're fine the way you are"" (to which they'd have no clue how wrong they are), and many more hollow words that people wish were instantaneous cures.

Now I'm not sure if girls can actually be incels, involuntary celibate, but they can come close. The reason that it's harder for girls to be incels is because most of the time men will literally sleep with anything that will sleep with them, and this isn't any girls fault. Most girls don't go around trying to fuck anything that moves because we're not designed that way, we don't go and hunt for sex that way, we're more into relationships.

Aside from that, it bugs me that this subreddit thinks that even ugly girls can get Chads........................No, no we can't. A Chad is not going to waste his time on an ugly girl when he has a hundred Stacy's he can get with. I've been rejected to my face by good looking men. If you aren't an attractive female in the world you're basically invisible. Any man that YOU find attractive isn't going to give you the light of day......the same thing can be said for ugly men. Ugly men aren't going to attract hot women. It's just how the world works. We all want to be with attractive people, and if you're ugly....it's not happening.

Being an ugly woman is absolutely horrible. It's not as easy as ""Just don't be a land whale"", you can have so many other bad features that make you ugly, I know first hand. You think I don't look at pictures of a Stacy and wish I looked like her? Makeup can only do so much, and I don't even wear any because why fucking bother.

But yes, girls have it easier in the sex department, because any desperate man will probably sleep with anything..but the thing is, most girls don't /want/ that? We don't want to just have sex and be tossed out. Sure there's people out there who are having casual sex, but....are any of those people ugly?

Anyways I'm done ranting. I'm just sick of hearing that ALL women have it GREAT in life.",18Oct2017,5
45,"I'm a stupid fucking cunt who acts like a stupid fucking toddler constantly getting enraged and hitting myself, I'm such a stupid lazy fucking dipshit. I got everything in my disposal, average wealth, good education, a house and a loving father yet i still can't fucking do anything, im fucking worthless so fucking worthless. Im a fat fucking moron who fails school and can't fucking run because god blessed me by having a frail fucking body and a personality of a fucking piece of trash. I'm failing everyone, im sorry mom, im sorry dad. I lash out at my only friend i cant control it i just get so mad it hurts because i know i hurt im on the inside im sorry .why do i hate being productive? why dont i study? why do i just play games, why does it feel like im gonna have a breakdown in the classroom? Im so good at faking it, i almost believe it myself and then i remember and i get so angry, and i cry in anger and continue hitting myself like the idiot i am. My dad didnt deserve this trash. 

Everyone who tells me that im not trash, its okay, it gets better, i hate it i know they are lying to make me feel better. because no one cares about this whiny piece of shit.

im sorry i just wanted to type it out, im sorry",18Oct2017,0
47,"So yeah. I feel like my friends whom I haven't spoken to in person for some time now, we keep in touch through snapchat and discord, don't really realize how hurtful they've become. I posted something I thought was genuinely funny and they said it was weird hentai (it wasn't there wasn't a single thing in it that was even mildly pornographic, one of the characters had big boobs and that was it, they weren't even exposed they were covered) and that it wasn't funny at all. I know that they were serious, trust me I just know. I've always told myself ""they're assholes but that they're my assholes."" But today, I felt like I was going to cry. I feel unappreciated and it's making me feel unstable and crazy, like I could go over the edge any moment. 

I know the obvious answer is to find different friends but some of my friends in this group have been my best friends for years, and they're good friends with just about everyone in our group. One of them is usually someone I can count on to be a real friend, and he's one of the only people I ever feel safe to drop my guard around and open up to.

I just feel really hurt, and this keeps happening. It's making me feel like i'm a freshman in high school again. I guess what really did it is that they usually respond to my posts with emojis like one or two, but this time one of them took the time to spell out ""not funny at all no"" with emojis and like half of them agreed. I feel like they are completely unaware of how much they're hurting my self-esteem. I think they'd be nicer if they did.",18Oct2017,5
48,"I don't know when or how it happened, but I just stopped saying how I feel and started putting on a happy face, saying everything is fine. Even with people I really trust, I just can't be honest with anyone anymore. I feel like the words won't come out. But truthfully, I started self-harming in December and I constantly think about suicide, even though I know I wouldn't go through with it. I can't be bothered anymore. The future is so daunting and feels futile. I can't have a relationship. I'm sorry. I just had to write this down because I can't talk to anyone. ",18Oct2017,32
50,"It has been years since I have. I am taking C++ in college right now, and literally, no one I know has heard of it. Just curious to see if anyone else used it, or if I am truly alone",18Oct2017,1
51,"Every now and then I will have a crazy random thought in the back of my head, and I usually can't dig deep enough into my brain to recognize the events that happen in it. I can only vaguely see an image of what happens in them, and once I figure out what happens, the memory fades and I have no idea what I just thought about. Then a new one comes the next day.

My point is that sometimes these ""visions"" are glimpses into the future. One time I had one of these thoughts about a sign on the side of a highway for some specific place at exit 97. The next thing I know, about a week later, we are driving on the highway and I see that sign. The exact same sign with the exact same words. I had never been on that stretch of the highway before. It happened about five other times as well.

Does anybody else get these visions? I had asked a few of my friends and 2/3 said that they knew what I was talking about.",18Oct2017,2
