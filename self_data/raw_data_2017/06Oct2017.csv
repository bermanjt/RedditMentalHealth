1,"I currently have an iPhone 6 and and have been thinking about switching to a basic, non-smartphone.  

I've become totally reliant on my phone because I can check my email, use it as gps, look up random facts or restaurants, listen to podcasts, check my bank account on the go... etc.

For those who have made the switch, was the adjustment difficult? Do you regret it?

I don't have a t.v. and only purchased a laptop because it was required for school. Starting to get wary about the amount of info all this technology can accumulate about one person, even when location is turned off. Plus, a non-smart phone seems to be much more cost-effective, which is a big plus.

What are your experiences?

2,"Some schools have been enforcing a new school rule in which students are supposed to place their phone in a pouch that is locked up until the end of the day. The pouch has a magnet which does not allow you to access your phone at all times.

My school has enforced this policy, we are not allowed to use our phone at all during school hours, this includes going off campus during lunch.

The schools ""goal"" is to reduce the amount of classroom disruptions that happen a day, as well as ""Developing Social Skill"" (Reduce social media drama etc)*

I can understand why some staff members are on board yondr, it has reduced teachers constantly having to ask students to put their phone away. But I feel like the system has more downsides than upsides.

In the beginning of the year teachers would take up to 20 Minutes making sure everybody in the classroom has their phone in the pouch, a huge waste of our first periods class time.

During our last period teachers have to start unlocking a students phone 10 minutes before class wasting even more classroom time.

It seems like a Majority of students do one of the following -Place a spare phone in the pouch -Claim they don't bring their phone to school -Leave their phone in their car -Take a pouch, but don't place a phone in it -Break the locking mechanism in the pouch, resulting in the pouch being able to open properly without the need of using a magnet.

Some teachers spend too much time focusing on the pouch rather than teach students, others seem to not care at all and place the pouches in a center desk.

""But Phone use has gotten down!"" are what teachers say.

Except it hasn't. Teachers now assume that everybody has no access to their phones and as a result students don't need to hide their phones as much, if anything they are using it more since staff is no longer scanning for phones in students laps.

The entire system is a mess and all the students know it is, it waste our class time and teachers can't stop bragging about the benefits. Some teachers have even told me they hate the policy due to the process of organizing every pouch before and after school. Another teacher told me that they hate it due to phones being a integral part of the class, so they have to constantly lock and unlock a students phone.

Can a school do this? I mean can they restrict the use of our devices even if we are not on campus? Our phones don't get unlocked if we leave school during lunch and a student can get in trouble if they are seen with a phone off campus.

I understand that some people may say stuff like ""Oh well you have to deal with it I didn't have a phone when growing up"". Yeah I get that, there was a time before phones but this policy is just extremely tedious and obnoxious. The only ones that Yondr are students that follow rules to begin with, students with the actual phone problems just carry a spare.

I would love to hear any thoughts on how others would feel about this policy if it were enforced in such a way at their school/workplace. Especially if there are school staff members/parents.

I know this may sound stupid but isn't this unreasonable seizure? If not on campus then what about off campus?Why can my school punish me for using my own property off campus? Why can they restrict me from my own property off campus? Are our rights affected by this? I know schools have the ability to take away our rights if it means we are posing a danger to others.",06Oct2017,2

I'm sick of the idea that he and I would actually write something or film something without him putting up a fight.
I'm sick of him throwing shit when he gets mad at a video game or just a little too mad, like he's a fucking infant. 
I'm sick of acting like his shitty attitude about everything doesn't drive me fucking ballistic.
I'm sick of acting like I don't know how to fix whats wrong with me. 
I'm sick of feeling sorry for myself. 
I'm sick of feeling so boring.
I'm sick of hating myself and my body.

I'm sick of thinking that I saw her tonight being dramatic in the rain like some kind of fuckin movie. 
I'm sick of missing her.
I'm sick at myself for coming to the conclusion that if we didn't have sex as often as we did I would've left her way earlier. 
I'm sick of saying shit like that knowing that it isn't true.
I'm sick at myself for trying to convince myself that I didn't love her.
I'm sick that at myself for not feeling the pain that loving her gave me. 
I fucking loathe that I can act like I used to when I'm around people but when I'm alone my thoughts drag across my mind like a fucking razor. 
I'm sick of not feeling confident in myself or my skills. Those are thigns that attract people to me in the fuckin first place.
I'm sick of having shitty friends who don't want to be around me but won't tell me they don't want to hang out with me. 
I'm sick of that fact that I feel like I can't tell my therapist this shit because it'll get me down this depressed track like it is now. 
I'm sick of my life. 

SO I'm going to change it. For real this time. I'm going to work every day from now on. I'm going eat better from now on. I'm going to work more at my craft so that when the time comes I'll be confident enough to get a job or at least now hate myself more. My professor that I'm good writer, and she's got a degree from the iowa writers workshop. She likes me, some other girls in class think I'm decent enough to talk to. I've been told I make people feel like they matter. So why can't I feel like I matter to me? Why can't I have value? I can. And I will. And maybe I won't have another girl for a long time, that idea makes me so sad but maybe when I'm not repulsed by my own body I can fuckin have confidence that a girl might want me too. I know I'm not stupid for having a hard time in arabic class, the shits hard as fuck. I am smart, contrary to what my best friend and his dumb ass girlfriend think. I am smart. I am strong. Contrary what my ex said I am no coward. I did everything I could to help her feel better but she was beyond my ability. That is enough. but I'm not enough. I hope someday to be enough but I doubt I ever will be. because if I get complacent I'll slip back into this fuckin thing I've become and I won't allow that. Not anymore. It's a new damn day.

I'm going to study the fuck out of arabic, I'm going to talk to my teacher no matter how embarrassed I am. I'm not going to feel ashamed as 3rd generation bi-racial arab american that I can't speak arabic very well. But most of all I'm going to give myself the love that I think I need, and the ridicule too.

Here's what I know. I am smart, I might not act it and I may not be the best at science and math but I'm decent enough at them and I'm damn good at people relations when I'm not feeling like this. I'm going to write this series with, or without my ""friend."" I'm going to work out and eat better, not to rub it in my ex's face, metaphorically of course, but to prove to myself that she was wrong. I'm not unreliable. I am disciplined, and I damn sure am no fuckin coward. I'm no Hercules, I'm no Stephen King, I'm no doctor but I am me,  and I'm no hero.

8,"I [25M] recently discovered my fiancee has been lying and cheating on me for at least 9 months. The first (to my knowledge) time being with my room-mate and at the time one of my best friends since high school. I don't think they actually F***ed but they were sexting and swapping nudes at least, while I was working to build a life for us.


My fiancee suffers from real mental illness, (Bipolar manic depressive, epilepsy , and trauma from a war ravaged childhood). To top that off she recently picked up a hard drug (Cocaine) habit that only worsens things. Because of complications (citizenship, work schedules , and a health insurance paperwork error due to her deceased mother), we never got her to a psychologist to get her on the meds she needed.





We signed for our first house (Rented) together on August 22nd. Since then her mental health has snowballed until last week when she broke down and began cutting herself with a razor blade. She was then admitted to a hospital, put on suicide watch, and they wanted her to stay an extra day so the psych doctor could treat her and give her referrals. She began to go all Manic, and refused treatment and left AMA (Against Medical Advice). I was so frustrated and heartbroken that I told her I can't help her or be with her if she won't help herself.


Of course to her manic state that's me being controlling and suspicious and she doesn't need help.


Anyway that night, the first night of our separation, I did what I had never done before because I want to have a trusting foundation, I snooped. I went on to her Facebook, and I see she is already listed in another relationship, (stating an Anniversary date of August 1st 21 days before we got our house together, even though it was just updated to facebook that night.) Also , on top of that, flirting with her ex boyfriend (hearts, calling each other bb, making plans) and this isn't even the same guy that she is in a ""relationship"" on FB with. I also discovered the old nudes and sexting from my old roommate. (they ended when she said she couldn't do it anymore because she loves me and couldn't betray me, oh the irony)
She admitted to this now, and apologized , and swears up and down that she never had actual sex or told anyone she loved them while we were together. She knows she's mentally unstable and doesn't know how to fix it, and claims she was starving for attention (we work opposite schedules. But swears (even after admitting what she has done) her heart stayed with me.


I love this woman more than anything in life I have ever known. I gave her my all, all of my heart, soul and body. I'm beyond heartbroken and in so much physical pain.
We are supposed to meet face to face sunday to discuss things. (who lives where , if we can salvage the relationship). I know all of the fucked up things she did to me really happened now, but I also know, with all of my being that, somewhere, somewhere inside, she does truly love me. I don't want to fuck myself over and end up being played like a bitch. I want to know the truth, of exactly what happened.


so my question to you guys is, where do I even begin to approach this conversation? How do I know if anything is true, how do I stand up for myself, What are my options legally if she refuses to leave, And most importantly, How do I convince my heart to give up? ",06Oct2017,1

13,"Some weird dramatic thing happened a year and a half ago and apparently I didn’t get the closure. So i need to like purge and get it out. The texts are paraphrased. I have my texts set to auto-erase after one year, so they’re all mostly gone.

Back in February/March of 2016, I was in a small friend group of 4 people: 2 guys and one other girl. The other girl and one of the guys were dating. We’ll call him A and we’ll call her B. B and I had been friends literally since birth, our parents had met before we were born. 

A little back story that will really become relevant later: I live with bipolar disorder, for which I am medicated and I have under control. I was raped in February 2014 and at the time this whole thing happened, I was coming back from what was basically a year long freak out. I spent most of 2015 dealing with the fallout of coming forward about my assault, figuring out my medication, and losing friends from my subsequent mental health episodes. It was not a good year for me, I didn’t leave the house much. So in 2016 I was really trying to figure out who I was as a person again. I hadn’t been around people other than my family and my therapist.

The other girl had (still has I’m sure) very bad anxiety. Basically everything made her anxious, which I empathized with obviously because at the time I didn’t fully understand what was setting off my episodes yet, I was just tense all the time, with huge waves of panic coming at random. I totally understood what she was dealing with.

Towards the end of February though, I started noticing something was happening. At the time, I was painting my room, which to be completely honest I had done in a bit of a hypomanic frenzy. And we had all been texting in the group chat. Both the boys were home that weekend (B and A went to the same college) and B was at school. So the guys offered to come over and help me paint my room. They made some joke in the chat about bringing me fries, because they said, “Need anything?” and I said, “Fries.” This “plan” while B was still at school apparently severely upset her, because she hadn’t gotten a text from A outside of the group chat all day. Her mother then called (or texted I can’t remember to be perfectly honest) my mother to ask what was going on at my house, and if the A was flirting with me. She needed to know because he daughter was crying because her A brought me fries.

What actually ended up happening was they came over with Taco Bell (no fries), which they ate on my couch while I continued to paint. A helped my put painter’s tape along the top border of my room (because he’s almost a foot taller than me and it was a huge help), but that was it. There were no fries, I think I had coffee while they were there. I texted B after they left and asked if she was ok and she said she was fine. I believe I opted not to tell her about the tape so as not to upset her, because I was usually careful not to upset her.

This was something I worried about all the time, especially concerning A. You see, B was for some reason always worried he was upset about something or didn’t have a good time when he left her house. Whenever B would get anxious about something involving A and ask her mom about it, her mom would just say to break up with him if she was that upset. From an outside perspective I can kind of see how her mom thought giving her an ultimatum like that (anxiety vs. not having him) seemed like a good idea. One night though, B cried to me about how her mom saying things like that to her made her feel like she didn’t deserve to have him. 

In regards to my anxiety, her mom would always say to me, in front of B, like ”You better be careful around A, he gets friend crushes, he’s gonna fall in love with you.” This not only made me nervous about even making eye contact with A, but keep in mind I had barely had contact with men outside my family for roughly a year. This was obviously destroying B’s confidence as well, making her think she had so loose a grasp on A that he would stray that easily. The mother was also trying to set me up with the other boy in our friend group (we hung out mostly at their house), in an attempt to make us some weird set up couple friends. This didn’t help my constant state of anxiety around men, and I started to feel like every guy around me was predatory, even the ones who were spoken for. *“Don’t be too friendly! Watch out!”* 

Fast forward a few weeks later, to the middle of March. This was the end of A and B’s spring break, and the beginning of mine. We were all hanging out on that Friday, and decided to go to a record store about 30 minutes away. Once there, we all kind of broke off, silently browsing on our own. So after we had been there for maybe 20 minutes, A motioned to me that he found a set of DVDs of the old Nancy Drew tv show with Pamela Sue Martin. This was our only inside joke, as we barely spoke outside of the group (or inside for that matter). He was also acutely aware of how anxious B was, and we seemed to have formed a sort of silent agreement not to talk or look at each other excessively in order to avoid setting her off. 

This exchange may have been where the trouble started that night. I am super into Nancy Drew, and A called me Nancy. This was our only inside joke, but B seemed to observe it as flirting, likely because he started that joke within our group. I don’t know what else I did or he did to make her think anything was going on. About 10 minutes later, after we had all gone back to silently browsing, B came up to me in the corner of the store and asked me if A was flirting with me. **ASKED ME IF HE WAS FLIRTING WITH ME.** I told her that no, he was not flirting with me. That was it. He and I had ONE interaction in that store. Looking back, I was wearing a dress that day because I had gone to lunch with my high school dance teacher. So maybe the dress made me look sluttier, I don’t know.

Soon after that we decided to go get sandwiches at a place that turned out to be a mile up the road. We should have driven but we underestimated the distance and before we realized we were too far away from the car so we kept going. We got the sandwiches, found a bench, sat and ate them. I wasn’t hungry so I was just sitting and hanging out. B was sitting directly next to me, all 4 of us were on the same bench. There had to have been less than half a foot between us. I glanced over casually, not meaning to look at her phone (literally how close we were) and I saw her texting her mom. The exchange I saw was an outgoing text saying (not verbatim, it’s been a while), “She says they’re not,” and her mother responding, “No she’s def flirting.”

At this point my stomach dropped. I don’t know if I was genuinely doing something that could described as flirting, or if B was really anxious already and her mom was trying to ease her by validating her perception of the situation. Either way, I was truly upset. I had already told her nothing was happening, and on top of that, I was being blamed and questioned instead of A. I was being questioned about a man’s actions again. I started having one of those quiet, dissociative panic attacks where your face goes numb. On the drive back to B’s house, she asked if I was ok, despite being anxious and furious. The rest of the night was mostly uneventful, however I would be told later that I seemed “fine” to justify everything that would be said to me.

The next night by best friend from high school came over to hang out. She was also home for her spring break. We got a cheesecake and a bottle of wine. So I was two glasses in, and slightly drunk. I have a low alcohol tolerance because of my medication. I had been telling my friend about what happened the night before and how uncomfortable and upset I was, and how this had been an ongoing thing for a little under a month. At some point I came to the conclusion that I had to confront B’s mom myself. Not super aggressively, but just ask her to stop saying to her daughter that I was doing these things. Not only was it hindering my recovery, but it was feeding into her daughter’s anxiety and creating drama where there was none. I texted her, in some capacity, “Please stop saying I’m flirting with A. I am not and will not ever be flirting with him.” To be fair, I was drunk, so there’s a chance whatever I said sounded more abrupt than that. I never received a response from her (ever again), but I did get a frantic phone call from B, who was called by her mother during a showing of Zootopia, and I assume was yelled at. She asked if she could come over and talk to me. I said yes, being drunk. B showed up and apologized, not specifically for anything just “everything.” I’m not sure she even knew what I was upset about. This would be the last time I saw her.

Also that night, I also texted A conversationally for the first time. I want that on record. The only other texts between us previously had maybe been me telling him to come to B’s, him telling me to come to B’s, and a jokey picture he sent me flying over “Area 51” which was really just random desert on his way to Vegas. I texted him to tell him what was going on. I would later be told by B’s mom that this was out of line, but he had be kept completely in the dark about everything. I was the only one being questioned and made to feel bad about B’s anxiety regarding our “behavior.” 
I guess it must have been that Sunday that A broke up with her. At the time I didn’t know it happened, I think he told me he “talked to her” on the way back to school after break. I’m not going to lie I have my calendar open because I’m a bit hazy on the order of events that week. I didn’t find out until Thursday that they had broken up. He has since told me that he was going to break up with her anyway, and he could have either done it then or pretended he was ok with everything and then have to wait for the right time another month or so later. On Thursday my mother got a paragraphs long text about what a terrible, sick person I am and how my mom didn’t have time for their friendship anymore. I actually kept a copy of this message in case these people ever made contact with my family again and tried to deny what they said, but there’s no point in quoting it because she clearly wrote it when she was really worked up and the grammar/spelling are messy. The whole message was basically: 


*Denying ever accusing me of anything

*Saying that I took no consideration for her daughter’s anxiety

*That there was no way I was affected by her actions because I “seemed fine” the night of the record store incident

*How I ruined all my high school friendships in the previous year (referring to 2015, post rape/mental health episodes)

*That I had no right to get “involved” in B’s relationship by telling A that I was being accused of pursuing him

*How immature my candidness about sex is (despite how much she loved it when the other guy in our friend group talked about sex. Double standard, amirite?)

*How I had tried to criticize her parenting - ok side bar at the bottom because it's not integral to the story but still crazy

*How sick is am (and how sorry she is for my mother about how sick I am)

I messaged B saying I asking her if she had seen this because I wanted an apology (from her mom) and her mother had blocked me. The whole message is incredibly hurtful coming from someone who’s known you since you were a baby, so I’m convinced on some level her mom probably showed her an edited version. There’s no way she wouldn’t apologize on her mother’s behalf if she had read the whole thing. At some point between Sunday and then, a tumblr post popped up saying she had tried to “dangle herself out a window because of” me and she was angry at me for even suggesting she should apologize, which I hadn’t. I hadn’t seen the tumblr post. I wanted her mother to apologize. After I saw it though I was of course, furious. Her mother was blaming me for a accusing me of stealing her boyfriend, and now she’s trying to hurt herself and blame me (I literally lost a friend to suicide a little over a year before)? So I was fuming mad. I wasn’t mad at her before that but her mother had convinced her so thoroughly that this had all been my fault, and that she’d lost a friend. And to top it off, she and A had broken up once before and stayed friends. When they broke up this time she had insisted they could do it again. A told me she seemed perfectly fine when he dropped her off and then she had a meltdown and attempted to blame me for it. She was apparently picked up and brought home from school that Thursday.

And after the screaming, silence. My ENTIRE extended family and A were blocked on all social media and I never heard from any of them again. The mom tried to contact my mom briefly like a week later and that was it. I’ve tried to get back in contact with B a few times in the hopes that she understands on some level that I wasn’t mad at her initially, but she blocked me on everything. She also has one of my gamecube games and I kind of want it back. These are people I knew my entire life. My mom was friends with the mother for 29 years, and the friendship was thrown away because I asked to be respected and had the audacity to clue someone (A) in on a situation he was unknowingly heavily involved in. No other explanations for the text messages I saw that night that started this whole mess were ever offered to me. Neither B nor her mother ever had a real conversation with me regarding how I was treated or what happened that week. 

Both A and the other guy in our group did hear from them again. B tried to get in touch with A a few times until maybe May last year? But that trailed off. She still tries to talk to our other friend but he did nothing at all in any of this. He does respond but we don’t hear much about it. He was unfriended in the mass block though.

However, in the weird friend divorce, I got the guys. The first time we all hung out without B, we noticed that not having the leering presence of her mom judging everything we did made us noticeably less anxious. The room was just lighter, we spoke freer. A and I didn’t stop talking which was cool. Around July of last year we kind of realized we were into each other and we’ve been “seeing each other” or whatever you want to call it since. I PROMISE we weren’t planning it. We didn’t even start genuinely having conversations until after they were broken up. I’m pretty happy about it.

The other day though I was trying to figure out why I’m still thinking about this and why I’m still angry. I figured it must be because I had all these horrible things about my character and mental health launched at me and had no chance to respond. A wall was immediately put up. So I figured I need to write my side of the story in its entirety, and launch it into the void instead of letting it stew in my brain. I’m turning 23 this month and graduating from college in December and I’d like the finish this chapter with this toxicity out of my system.

I was recruited for my current job right out of university and took the position because so many of my friends were struggling to find jobs at the time. I have been working there for about 4 years now, and have slowly moved up in the ranks of the company. The job is in the financial sector and I have 0 interest in this field (I went to school for fine arts).

Now the issue....

I used to enjoy my job, not because of what I did but more because I loved to work with the people on my team. Over time, the company has really changed and I’m finding it a struggle to want to go to work (something that wasn’t a problem a few years ago). I’m constantly pushing for the situation to improve in the company but my comments are falling on deaf ears. I am also in a position where there is no further personal growth, and I feel I’m being underplayed for the amount of stress I’m dealing with on a day-to-day basis. I don’t see any of this changing since it’s been 6 months since everything started to go seriously downhill with no signs of improvement. Many other people who had been at the company longer than I have started leaving as well....

As much as I hate my current job, I feel very secure in my position (to be honest they would be really screwed without me). It’s a secure job with “ok” pay. That said, after much research I finally found a job that I would consider my dream job, but I am hesitant to even apply. I am worried that if I quit my current job for this new one and the new company decides to fire me during the 3-month probation, that I will have screwed myself over by leaving a secure job and we will struggle to pay the bills (I’m currently the main money-maker in the relationship).

Any advice or words of wisdom?",06Oct2017,12
22,"It's been a month since we broke up now. I dumped her. I cheated. We were together for 3 months. But by the 2nd I was getting bored.  

She still comes over though. She still wants me. She texts me often. I don't really know how often she does it because I have her muted. It must be at least every day though. I only see her messages late at night when I'm bored and I text her to come over. She comes I cum, we spoon for a bit then she goes.

The sex is better now than it ever was when we were together. I never really felt a connection when we in bed. Which is weird. She always wore her emotions. You could always tell what she was feeling just by looking at her. It's ironic. The girls before her always complained that I was ""distant"" except when having sex. Maybe because I always like to take it slow. Other guys seem to just dive in it, go fast and intense. I feel like you don't really get to ""feel"" them that way. It just feels selfish.

But who am I to talk about selfish? Here am I dragging her along, just for my own pleasure. I mean guess It's not actually all me. She doesn't have to come over. 

During the day I'm with other girls. Usually they make it to my Snapchat. But at night she's in my bed. That must annoy her a lot.  I don't know why she bothers even. She knows it's not only her. Why can't she move on? Can I even move on?

Maybe I'd feel less guilty if she wasn't beautiful. Body, mind, character, her warmth. Everything. When we were initially together I couldn't find a fault. I still can't. We just can't mesh. The thing is that this guilt doesn't feel like real guilt. When I'm with her I don't care. It's only when I think about it the guilt arrives. 

Her warmth. Her skin. Her hair. Her beauty. If only she could let go",06Oct2017,0

24,"Let’s get right into it.
I have a small group of friends. I really only consistently talk to one of them. I don’t connect with my friends anymore and it makes me very sad. I feel lame around them and sometimes they say things that confirm that. I am introverted and do enjoy being home. I still live in my hometown, which brings me a lot of comfort and aggravation. Last year I got into some trouble with the law. Because of that, I decided to “get my life together” and go back to school. I spent a lot of time going to the bars, doing drugs and now I’m over that social setting. I also realized that I was living that life for others, not really because I wanted to. So I’m back in school now working towards a bachelors. I am interested in finishing school and moving out of my hometown. I envision a healthy work/social life balance and a strong network of friends who support me and vice versa. 

I commute to school so I feel I miss out on a social life on campus. As goofy as it sounds, I don’t think I know how to make friends anymore. I talk and I just feel really awkward. I’m tired all the time too. I have a lot on my plate right now. Sometimes I question if I even need friends. I feel really alone and different. Any tips on getting through this? Any experience? Help lol 

I also want to point out that I do not feel “better” than my friends, just different. ",06Oct2017,330
25,"I have two older brothers who are six and nine years older than me, respectively. A few weeks ago I was chatting with my coworker and she asked me how my brothers were doing. I told her that I didn't really know exactly since there were a few months since I last met them. She asked me further and I told her I only met my oldest brothers during holidays and maybe occasionally in the summer. The other one I meet about once every two months. We mostly just exchange pleasantries.

This made her very uncomfortable. She has a sister that is two years younger than her and two much younger brothers and she couldn't imagine seeing them or talking to them only a few times a year. I couldn't help but to feel a bit judged by her. I've been thinking a bit about this ever since and it seems to me that most siblings are quite close.

The worst is that my brothers and I are very gregarious so this makes people even more surprised about my relationship with them. However, we have very little in common and ever since I was diagnosed with Asperger's in 2004 they've wanted to keep me at an arm's length. Obviously, I'm not going to reveal this to coworkers and friends. 

Is there anyone else here that has a very distant relationship with their siblings? Do you know what caused that? How do your friends and family feel about it?",06Oct2017,3
26,"I cant even write about this coherently. There's 100,000 krw in cash (10,000$ usd equivalent) in a cabinet in the kitchen. I took it out from my bank account a few weeks ago. It's there in case war breaks out, and money is needed in a crisis situation where ATMs might be unavailable.

Within a few months, possibly less than that, I think war will break out...

I want to leave further south before it happens, to a small city I've been before. There's less chance for a nuke to fall there. But it means leaving my family behind. Specifically my mother who doesn't believe there will be war, and my sister who is only in middle school. Today my father told me, ""even if we all die, you at least should live.""

Taking that 100,000 krw and going further south. By myself? How is this a fair decision or one I can make? I've failed to convince them of the urgency. If it happens, then death is so close. They're aware of the danger but they don't see it as i see it. It will be a huge conflict, so close to home. So so close. It won't just end with a boom. It will keep happening. I see it all. 

Doesnt matter how this happened. All that matters now is getting myself and my loved ones to safety. But they don't understand how painful... it will be, otherwise they'd move with me to the south. They tell me i should be my own person. That's a stupid thing to say. It's so fucking stupid...

Been crying on and off for the last few weeks because i cant help but think the end is near. Even if not my own life, the end of everything i know. Just an impending sense of doom and i dont know what to do beyond trying to save my own skin. ",06Oct2017,2
27,"so I've had problems with this girl since high school. we've never liked each other over petty drama. We're both 19 now and last week we got into this big argument over twitter. We were both talking shit to each other. So one thing led to the next and she threw some insults at me, so I took a very low blow and basically talked about her disabled son calling him slow and retarded. I was mad and it was in the heat of the moment. anyways she took this very seriously, and we ended up meeting to fight. I wanted to fight her for awhile so I was fine with this. so idk if it was her anger over that comment but as soon as we started fighting, she got me on the ground, got on top of me and was completely whooping my ass until other ppl broke it up. I'm so mad and humiliated b/c it got recorded and she was bragging. I feel I need to get revenge on her somehow. She blacked my eye and busted my lip, and I don't want her thinking she can get away with this. What should I do?",06Oct2017,0
29,"Uh. So yeah I've been rejected a few times but never really been hearth-broken by it. Should I be? I feel like I either didn't know the person enough or like them enough as a friend that while it felt bad, and there was maybe a bit of a sting for a while, it's never been overwhelming or everlasting or other things that the typical heartbreak is like.",06Oct2017,5
32,"Alright guys and gals, I took your advice. I told him. Only it was kind of bad timing and I'm kind of dumb and a little sad right now. Also, we have a five hour rehearsal together in three hours and I think I made a huge mistake.

Today we were sitting together, he was playing guitar and I was just talking to him about random stuff when the subject of my mom came up. I told him that she said she thought we were more than friends.  I said, ""are we friends?""

He looked at me and said ""I don't know"". Yes, I should have taken a right and just stopped the conversation, but I pushed through. ""Yeah, I think I'm starting to like you and I know it'll fuck everything up"".

Lo and behold comes our obligatory awkward moment of silence. I sat there looking at my fingernails while I mentally beat myself up for confessing right after he said he was unsure. I honestly don't know what I was thinking when I blurted it out, but my face was getting red and I kind of wanted to die

He finally told me that he already knew because a friend of mine (not really friend) had told him a while ago. 

I had to leave right after he said that so I did, and now I'm at home feeling a little crushed and sad. I'm glad that I finally got it out, but I am a little )): . Thanks for the advice guys, I'll get over that embarrassing moment soon. ",06Oct2017,3
33,"If I come close with a guy I never actually want to have sexual contact 

I feel it's a sin even if am horny af 


But others just ride it with no remorse then move on to the next guy/girl 

Is it normal to not want to because you would rather be in love to do it ?? 

Sometimes I think am fuckin stupid in this day and age every one just fucking rides it .

I think it's disgraceful lol ",06Oct2017,0

40,"I've known this girl for like a year. We met through work and quickly became good friends. We just kind of naturally clicked. As time went on we'd talk more and more while working and we became pretty close work friends. I think being around each other makes both our shifts a hell of a lot easier. I started to crush on her, and that led to me talking to her like everyday, but she got a boyfriend so I kind of tried to tone it down a little and just talk to her when we worked together, which wasn't often anymore. While I knew we had a connection, I just didn't know whether it was because we had to see each other if that makes sense. Like if being in work just made it seem like we got on more than we actually would in real life. Either way, I didn't want to get too involved when I have feelings for her while she's in a relationship.

So anyway, she recently started at my college and she suggested we hang out since she didn't really know anyone there. So I went and met her on her first day while she got the hang of shit. I don't really have college friends, I actually tended to just avoid going in altogether last year, so it was nice to hang out with someone during the day. For a couple of months before that we had barely talked, maybe like once a week, but something kind of clicked then. At least for me. I just had such a good time that day, and so we ended up talking more again. And we've been messaging all day everyday since, from like the moment we both wake up until basically when we go to sleep. This has been going on for like a couple of weeks. We also hang out at college during the day pretty often.

Anyway, I feel noticeably happier everyday. She motivates me to get my ass to college in the first place, and being around her is just fucking amazing. I feel completely relaxed. Any silence between us is never awkward, we joke around constantly. It's just so fun. It is obviously hard to deal with how I feel about her seeing her so often.  But honestly I don't care. I feel like it's worth it. My only real problem is that I think she kind of has an idea how I feel. She doesn't tend to message me when her boyfriend's around, like she'll like open a message from me and reply half an hour later. I feel like she maybe doesn't want him to know how often we talk or something.

Anyway, today we were talking and we got onto the topic of how much we hang out. She had jokingly said she hadn't seen me in a few hours and we'd need to catch up sometime. We joked around a little and she eventually said that she probably sees me now more than her closest friends, but that in all honesty she enjoys and she doesn't think that it's a bad thing. I told her the same. And honestly, as a guy who's been depressed as fuck for a couple of years now, having someone tell you how much they enjoy hanging out with you means everything. Especially with how often it's been and she's not like bored of me or whatever. I honestly feel more content around her than I do my closest friends. Just knowing you're enough for someone is the best feeling in the world. Sure I have more feelings for her than I'm able to tell her, but I really don't want to fucking ruin this. This is shaping up to be like one of the best connections I've made in my life, regardless of any romantic shit between us. Having someone in my life who actually cares about seeing me, and shows it is honestly fucking amazing.",06Oct2017,3
