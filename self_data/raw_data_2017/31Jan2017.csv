1,"I quit my job as a supply teacher because I honestly couldn't stand it anymore and it made me want to blow my brains out.  I didn't have a backup, but I knew I couldn't do it for even one more day. I used to get anxiety attacks and start crying whenever I would have to go to work. My husband didn't understand this, although he has never pressured me to go and has even said I don't need to work because he can support us. I'm looking for other jobs now, things like social media specialist/online marketer and positions in university admissions/writing and editing/any other random job that looks like it could use my transferable skills as a former teacher. I'm feeling down because I don't know how/where to start and I don't feel like I will find anything else. I'm just feeling a bit hopeless and it's hard to keep my chin up. I also suffer from anxiety (undiagnosed) so that may be a factor. ",31Jan2017,3

12,"i just do. i don't know why i kid myself, why i even do this to myself! i'm an adult, a 24 year old woman, but i'm so hung up on my best friend's neighbor. he's 21, just AMAZING, i barely know him but i can't believe i feel this way over such a person. never have i ever felt this. he's a mechanical engineer, a musician, a mechanic and connoisseur, he's refined and polite and funny and really cute to boot and it's like, UGH, why can't i just... yikes, nevermind, i'm getting ahead of myself, but damnit, this is painful. so painful. i feel like i'm fifteen again. sorry for the way this is patterened, i need to get this out of my system before i start crying again.


anyways, he was homeschooled, so i never encountered him until one horrible day when I had crashed my car. when i would visit my friend who lived next door to him, i didn't know he existed -- i remember seeing several, and i mean SEVERAL cars that were just like mine in the yard and driveway. i was looking for parts, just needed to talk to someone about finding a new axle and other things. i left a note on one of their cars, and a few hours later received a text.


it was the owner's son -- he was helpful, friendly, talkative. i have since sadly lost his number and the texts messages but i really enjoyed the conversation. i added him on facebook and we talked ever since.
only recently have i talked to him face-to-face. i'm shy, and he might be too, but i'm painfully awkward as a person. one time when i was at my friend's house a few weeks back, i saw him working on his car. my stomach turned for a whole five hours before i went out to say hi! i was so glad i did, we talked for a whole twenty minutes and it was smooth. i wanted to talk forever but didn't want to bother him so i made an excuse to leave...


a week later my car wasn't doing so great and had an issue, and of course i asked him to help me! he did, and we didn't talk a whole lot that time... still friendly but not much in the ways of alternative conversation. it's funny. i was so anxious, i wore a ton of makeup. i high-fived him.


i went home and felt like maybe i was just fooling myself, why would someone like him even think about someone like me? i still feel like that. i guess we talk but i'm always the one obv to start conversation... so i'm definitely just kidding myself, right? he's just my friend, and that's all, right? :( how will i ever know?",31Jan2017,2
13,"My father, a Kurd, immigrated from Iraq in the 1970's. He spent time in Saddam's prisons and left his entire family behind because they would not immigrate with him. He met my mother, a country girl from Mississippi, and here I am. Growing up in Mississippi in the 80's and 90's, I never, ever felt marginalized and always felt my peers viewed me as one of their own. In fact it never even occurred to me that they wouldn't. 

I have two half siblings, decades older than me, from my mother's first marriage. They both voted Trump. Now that the shit has hit the fan there is radio silence. I missed Christmas with my family this year bc of all the Trump support. I do not feel supported by my own family. Even my own mother would not renounce his hate speech.

How can they sit idly by, with my anger mounting, acting as if all is well? I absolutely hate them for it. I feel betrayed and that despite how I look in the mirror, I should forget my Kurdish-ness.

So I'm a junior in HS and as teen crushes go they are normally drama filled and awkward but here me out. So I have a crush on this girl (let's call her Laura) and I've known Laura for the better part of 2 years and I always noticed she was more flirtatious with me than to most other people (although I didn't really care at this point) it was cool to know that a girl might like me. So I eventually got around to liking Laura as well, as we were placed in the same math class 2 years in a row. 

After some drama and a bunch of her friends telling me she liked me and telling me to ask her out I was gunna do it! Take her to a hockey game cause she's into that! But literally the week I was gunna ask her, it was like a switch. She stopped replying to my texts and was really awkward when I talked to her. I thought at first it was just she was having a bad day but after 3-4 days I knew something was up. So I confronted her about it and she said stuff I've heard all before like ""i can't have a bf rn"" etc etc. and basically put me in the ""friendzone"" and it was really awkward between us for a bit but I eventually started talking to her again.

Now after a few months we've moved on way past where we were before and truly are friends on a deeper level, and I see her doing the same things that she did when she liked me before, for example, talking about my other friend that talks to her, and she always asks me if he likes her also she trusts me with some of her deep problems and she helps me as I help her. Also just other flirtatious behavior. My point is that I want to date her because she's a great person and I like her a lot but I don't wanna get shut down again like I did before. She has a history of being sort of a tease with other guys (including me lol) but I like to think this, and I may be different! 

Thanks for any advice!

I had no idea that the GOP was so galvanized that they wouldn't stand up to him while he grabbed our Constitution by the pussy.

I can't stop reading, can't stop thinking that there must be something we can do to stop this fascist dictator from corrupting our elections process, gagging our media and non-profits, turning us into a police state, starting a civil war.

I just want to shout to our allies, ""HELP! HELP! PLEASE! Don't you see we don't want this??"" But the rest of the world seems just as terrified of our unstable leader as we are.

The feeling of going from economic leader of the free world to third world fascist dictatorship in the course of a week is so sickening at the core of my soul.

27,"As a person growing up with arab-cultured parents I have been forced to either do engineering or medicine, of which I chose engineering. I have argued many times with my parents that engineering wasn't what I wanted to major in, but whenever they ask me what I want my mind goes blank. I've never had any goals or ambitions for my future, I've only wanted to make money and that's it. I never saw myself as an engineer.

My freshman grades were good but not good enough to get into engineering, so I had to repeat three courses the next fall semester. However, they still wouldn't accept me because of my calculus 2 grade which was a C+ and they needed a B-. Same for my chemistry grade. After days of arguing and speaking to the dean of students and a well known advisor at the engineering department, the engineering comity gave me a chance for me to continue engineering with saving a little time. 
I was told I had to take Calc 3, Statics and Chemical Principles as a majorless student and I have to take a minimum of B on each for them to accept me. So 9 credits in one semester. Each course in my opinion is not easy, especially the statics which I find difficult.

Should I continue and try to get a B on each? or just drop them and apply next semester to another major?

Today this struck me. I have to do a major work for my software design class, I chose to make a simple RPG game, which I've already started work on making the graphics. But I know my Dad wanted me to do something related to his job as a science professor. But the thing is I put so much effort into making the graphics and deciding what to do, doing all the planning and all this that it's far too late to just ditch it. In fact my teacher said today that if you don't at least have an idea for what your doing then you're screwed basically. I can tell my Dad wanted me to do something like that though, he never says anything about it but I know he's worried about how little time he has with me now before I go to university. I guess I could just work on it later for him? Like it's not that what he had was a bad idea it's just too late for me to scrap what I had originally.

I get it. America has elected Trump as our President. There's nothing we can do about that. But even most of ""moderate"" Republicans I talked to and voted for him somehow are surprised at what the heck is going on. Walls are being built, literally, metaphorically, socially, physically, and mentally. Against illegal Mexicans. Against immigrants who are in need of basic human rights, searching for safe places for them and their family. Against scientific community. Against facts. In my entire life, I've known America as the country that has worked hard for progress and equality. Black men and women. People of all religions. All women. LBGT community. This is the first time I've ever sense this country going backward on its progresses. The progresses that more than half the nations on earth are still trying to achieve and long for.

&amp;nbsp;

And all for what? So that the blue collar workers can get the jobs back from Mexicans that they themselves would never do in the first place? So that they can potentially work at the coal mining jobs like the good old days, polluting the earth even further and don't care about the consequences because they feel like the impact, if there's even such thing, won't affect them with only 30-50 more years they have left to live anyway? So that their own religion and its teachings will become the law of the nation and everyone must follow? So that the terrorists will not get into our country even though US already has the most strict, rigorous  screening process in the world?

I've been through a lot with fighting myself, but when I finally came out, I've never felt so relieved in my life.

So I stand here today just thinking about the past few years and how much has changed for the LGBTQ Community.  When I first came out, I never thought I would be able to marry the one I love.  I had friends who were accepting, but I thought being such a small minority how would our voices be heard.  It wasn't until all these events that I realized how many people stood up for us.  Allies of the LGBTQ Community gave our voice a louder voice.  They made sure that we had a **right** to marry, a **right** not to be discriminated**, a **right** to be treated like a human being with the same rights as anyone else in the U.S. and the World.  So I know Thank You is never enough, but again Thank You to all those who made sure the LGBTQ Community had a voice and could be treated like a human being.

That brings me to why I'm writing this.  To the Allies of the LGBTQ Community, to the LGBTQ Community and to anyone who is a decent human being...It is our time to bring attention and a voice to the next oppressed group.  We can't just sit back and do nothing.  I know what it feels like to be treated like I don't have certain rights, and I want to make sure that doesn't happen to anyone else.  So we all need to get together and make sure the minority has a voice, a louder voice than what we had.  We need to let people know we are going to stand up to discrimination, we are going to stand up to hate!  We must continue to fight hate, because Love with always Trump Hate.

50,"I didn't get much help over in the relationships subreddit so I thought I'd try here


I love my girlfriend more than anything in the world but lately it seems that I love her so much more than she does me. We had a big discussion about 2 weeks ago which was basically her saying that she has kinda checked out but described it as me being her home and shes in the lobby, but not out the door yet. But did not want me to leave. I didn't want to leave either and so i said we should keep things going for a month and then revaluate.


It has been 2 weeks and it has been really great. She has been showing more afffection and overall the relationship felt great again. So this weekend I brought up that its been a month since that discussion (it hasn't which I didn't realize since everything has been so great time kinda flew by) and do you want to reevaluate. This discussion basically boiled down to that she doesn't know what she wants. That since this is the longest relationship she has been in that she is scared. But that she is also scared of not being with me. She said something about the forever thing scares her, so I asked her if she didn't think I'm the one and she said no that's not it. So this is all very confusing for me. I told her she needs to think about what she wants, so I left, hugged her goodbye, and kissed her forehead during which she looked very sad. That was on Sunday at 10AM, we didn't text or talk the rest of the day.


In the past month or two sex was very scarce and when I brought this up to her she said that it didn't have anything to do with me and that she just wasn't interested in sex at all. She talked to her doctor about it who said it was stress related. However, I started working out a lot recently and started to get some really good muscle definition and magically the sex has started appearing more. During our talk this weekend she said that the night before the sex was really great but lately that it hasn't been and that she doesn't know if its just her or what. She says it starts off great but then somewhere in the middle it doesn't feel good and ends up hurting. I don't know what this really means, but I think a lot of this stuff has to do with hormones or something due to her birth control.


I gave her an ultimatum essentially saying that I love her and that I am willing to put in any effort needed to make this work and that if she is willing to commit to this relationship that I am all in. Otherwise I am gone forever. I said I did not want to feel like an option and that I need a commitment in this relationship. She said that unfortunately she is unsure about me, us and that she isn't exactly sure why or how to work that out. I feel like you deserve so much more and even tho you think Im enough for you, i don't think i am or could be.


""I feel like i just dont deserve you, your to good for me.. I am an awful person when it comes to communicating and ive been trying but it just hasnt fully worked out and i think thats one of our main problems. When i think of how you make me feel and then when i think to how i make you feel its almost unfair. Unintentionally its almost one sided. I dont mean it to be, I have been working on this relationship but i dont think its enough for what you deserve.""


It eventually ended with...


""I hope you don't end up hating me and one day we can talk again. I want you to know that I do love you, but I'm not ready to continue going foward. Your probably the best thing that has ever happen to me and I feel like I'm going to regret this decision but at this point in time I just feel like this is what I have to do. I'm so sorry for being weak and putting you in this situation...""


I wasn't going to try and make her feel trapped or forced to stay in the relationship so i took it at face value and said that I respect that, It's been fun, and that I hope she finds what she is looking for. In the end it was a very civil breakup. I still cried because I really thought that she was the one even though many of you think that is a myth but I really thought I had a future with her. I told her that maybe in a couple years we could catch up and relive some of the good times we and she said she would like that.


That's the end. I guess I'm basically looking for advice on how to move forward. I do think that one of the reasons of this is because she is young and doesn't want to miss out on what's out there and maybe felt tied down too early which I understand. It sucks for me but what can I do? We just met too early I guess. Maybe in the future when we have both matured we could rekindle, but right now I don't want to dwell on that.


TL;DR


We ended up breaking up in a very civil manner. I am pretty torn up about it but that's something I have to deal with. Basically looking for coping advice, maybe some personal anecdotes on other's personal stories that could help. I really thought that she was the one and most of me hopes that she wants a relationship with me again. I just feel that this is all kind of sudden and I really still don't understand why.",31Jan2017,7

58,"I was going to have a very bad grade in ethics (d) and my teacher told me to write an essay if i wanted a c.
Now i had a d because i don't do anything in school and i laugh and talk a lot which i'm not proud of. I often don't even try to do at school as i have a lot of stuff to study and do outside of it and if i also studied for school i would be miserable.

This left an impression on her that i am one of the dumbest studest in class.

Anyways i don't care about my school grades as the marks we get at this grade won't really affect anything. My mom however does care about them and i didn't want to make her upset so for once i thought i was going to get ready. And i did, i got up like 4 hours earlier and started reading. The topic was ""what is love"".


Anyways im too lazy to write more about this occurance but basically i spent a great deal of effort writing the essay and it turned out pretty great. Apparently it was too great for what my teacher expected of me so she told me i copied it from the internet. I repeatedly told her i did not, i offered to give her my notes for writing it as well as asked her to find the essay or even a single sentence from it on the internet, but she just ignored me. Now i have a D :(",31Jan2017,1

60,"I have a friend that I've had deep feelings for this past 4 years. Maybe if I had the balls to ask her out sooner, I might have had a chance. But I didn't. Had to sit back the whole time, watch her start dating a guy, then get married and have a kid with him. You know what I did?

I told her I was happy for her, even though I felt like I was dying inside. I did my best to establish a friendship with her husband. When their marriage started to have trouble, I gave her a shoulder to cry on (with no ulterior motives), and did my best to give her advice on how to fix things - even though I knew I could use my influence to sabotage their relationship.

Because I love her, and I want her to be happy. Even if I'm not the one who she is happy with. No matter what else does or does not happen between us, I'm her friend first. Maybe after her divorce she will see me differently, and maybe she won't. But as long as she's happy and I can still have her in my life, I'm going to be satisfied with it.

And she does know how I feel. And I know that she doesn't feel the same way about me. We had a very frank conversation about it once. It really sucks. Sometimes I just want to cut off all contact with her and fall for someone else and forget her, because it hurts being in love with someone who you know does not, and probably will not ever, feel the same way. She will eventually find a great guy, and she will be happy with him. And I won't be a part of it.

And no one else comes close to comparing with her. I think about her almost constantly. I look forward to talking to her in the morning, and she's the last person I want to hear from before I go to bed at night. I've tried pursuing other women, but I just can't put my heart into it. It's going to take someone absolutely mind blowing to make me love them more than her. And I don't know if I would even give them a fair chance.

I'm just a fucking romantic idiot, I suppose.",31Jan2017,2
61,"Hey Reddit, How's it going? 

I have a couple professors this term who just drone on for 80 minutes straight. They don't use powerpoint, they don't write things on the white board. They just stand and they monologue. 

I find it really hard to absorb anything they say. I try to take notes but I end up just writing down what they say verbatim and it isn't really helping.

62,"I read a post the other day about the experience of someone who clinically died after a car accident - heart stopped for 11 minutes and how it basically felt like the body shutting down and them sleeping.

Thinking about it earlier i wondered if there are any redditors that have strong religious beliefs that have also experienced a death - and how they attributed it with their religious take on life and death?

Do you see it as 'not a real death' that your god(s) let it play out as their plan? did it shake your belief at all? was your experience different?

Note i dont want this to become a 'our religion is correct' or 'you believe in god so your wrong' type deal, im an atheist myself but dont care WHAT people believe in - it's their choice and i respect that, im just intrigued for personal accounts to satisfy my curiosity.",31Jan2017,2
63,"6/6/2015 - Haha. OMG Trump's running for president. Lol. He'll never beat the other guys 16 candidates. He's saying crazy shit about Mexican rapists and building Mexican border walls. He won't last 3 months in this race. 

July 2015 - Sure he's leading in the polls but the field is super crowded once it thins out he'll fall back and Jeb! Or Cruz will take the lead. 

12/7/2015 - Banning Muslims, lol that'll get him run out of the primaries for sure. He's toast. He probably won't even win a debate.

2/1/2016 - See he won those debates but he lost Iowa. This shitshow is winding down.  Told you guys Cruz would be the guy. He'll be lucky to win 2 states on Super Tuesday. 

3/1/2016 - Those states don't have many delegates and most of them were in the south anyway and you guys know how wacky those southern Republican voters can be. 

3/3/2016 - Romney is against him and so is the party leadership and its living former presidents. Pack it in. He's toast. 

3/11/2016 - With all these people protesting surely people will realize he's a dangerous candidate and change their support to another candidate. Overt violence at rallies. He's done he'll never be the nominee. 

5/3/2016 - they'll still contest the convention. Even though he won these primaries. He doesn't have the delegate count he needs to get the nomination without a floor fight. 

5/26/2016 - he's got the delegates but the GOP will still find a way to stop him. Plus he'd never beat Hillary anyway and they know that. He'll get embarrassed by her in an electoral landslide. 

7/21/2016 - haha. Pence? Really? Man he's just making this harder for anyone else normal to vote for him. Hillary is going to wreck him in November. Plus. Lol debates. She'll beat him to death with policy. 

9/1/2016 - He's already insulting world leaders. He's toast in November man. There's just no way he can win. His path to victory is so slim. I read FiveThirtyEight everyday and Nate Silver knows his shit. Everyone relax and watch as Hillary dismantles this clown in these debates. 

September/October 2016 - See Clinton won all three debates. The long national Shitshow is over. She'll crush him in The election. There's literally no way he can win.  Nate Silver says we got this fam. 

10/7/2016 - he said grab her by the pussy. There's no way he can ever overcome this. Game over. Clinton's got this. 

11/8/2016 - ho. Lee. Fuck. He did it. But he'll never be able to enact half of his agenda.  Congress will stop him. Someone will stop him. 

Last week - he wants to build the wall and deport people. No way he can get the Muslim ban through. 

Friday - holy shit he did it. And purged 54 high level people from the State department. 

This week - but he'll never consolidate power and disobey orders from the courts (spoiler alert: he did this too)

Next week - he'll never install himself as supreme dictator. 

Next month - he'll never figure out a way to ethnically cleanse and purge these people. They're American citizens for fucks sake...

65,"Once the president won the 2016 general election the far left movement had a complete meltdown. the globalist SJW candiate that the media and the far left tried to cram down our throat has lost. but the point is that people are protesting in the streets about trump, the fears are largely unfounded. When this all started to die down they found their ammunition to try and discredit trump for being a racist and xenophobe. That ammunition was his 
executive order that was designed to protect US citizens. These people are using refugees to further their own political agenda.I find that behavior disgusting and manipulative.

She reminded me about an interview I had coming up that she put me forward for (they get job opportunities) and she then turned upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (cheerful, which made a change) she said 'you got interview clothes?' I replied 'yes, Iv got all that' (nicely) and she said 'oh have you got al that' (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put done aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then laughed/giggled (I smiled along with it) im a young guy and she's in her early 30s.
