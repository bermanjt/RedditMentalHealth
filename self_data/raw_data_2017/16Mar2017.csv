2,"For reference, I'm a 24 year old who has been playing video games an unhealthy amount since I can remember. I live with 2 roommates and support myself by working 90+ hour weeks for 4 months and taking the rest of the year off. My days usually consist of 10-12 hours of sleep, and the rest generally goes towards video games. It's horrible, I've put my life on hold and I don't know how to break out of it. I've sold my computer multiple times and always end up with another eventually. 

I have 0 discipline and no drive to further myself. I tell people I want to, but I'd honestly rather be playing games, I feel like a child. I've just recently disassembled my computer and have no idea how to build the discipline to start a real life. I don't even know what I want my life to look like. 

I'm sorry, this probably comes across as an unorganized rant but I would honestly love advice. I think it goes without saying that I am quite depressed and life seems rather pointless (not suicidal, just lack motivation for anything). I don't know if it's a product of my lifestyle or my lifestyle is a product of depression.",16Mar2017,3

9,"I don't like to bother people. Maybe that seems like a fairly commonplace belief, but I take to an extreme: I intentionally avoid anything outside my job that requires confrontation or talking to someone very negatively. Despite largely living my life without really caring about what others think of my personal life choices, I am incredibly, no *deathly* afraid of emotionally upsetting others.

I was diagnosed as an Aspie when I was 10, and of course with that comes social awkwardness and a frustrating inability to act on one's sexual desires due to being paralyzed with fear over the consequences of failure. For middle school, high school, and college, the story was much the same: see an attractive girl, sometimes talk to her and occasionally become friends, but always keeping a distance. No flirting, no asking anyone out, no suggestive moves. Nothing, in my mind, that *bothered* anyone. Nothing that was dangerous, nothing that could backfire. 

I kept this rule of thumb for platonic friendships as well. In college, I noticed that alcohol and partying had made me somewhat more open: I was less afraid of failure due to having gained confidence, and it seemed as if my personality was slowly starting to change. But, when I got rejected for a promotion at that job that I felt was extremely deserved, it triggered a downward depressive spiral that caused me to stop seeing most of my friends and smoke weed constantly in an effort to hide my disappointment and loneliness (side note: weed is what taught me that there can be such thing as too much of a good thing). 

Eventually I recovered from that, and now college is done with and I'm on the hunt for full-time employment. But, on the inside, I feel as if I completed a circle back around to where I was before college began. I don't have any in-person friends I talk to. I barely speak with my roommates. All of my free time is solitary, and usually spent on my laptop or smoking a blunt alone in my apartment parking lot. 

On top of that, my sex drive and desire for romantic relationships has inexplicably fallen dramatically over the past year or so. Before, I fell into the typical Aspie trap of denying my romantic/sexual feelings while pretending I didn't have them. Now I'm searching myself and I genuinely *do* think my desire and motivation to pursue sex or dating is either gone or deeply suppressed.

*On top of that*, when my body and mind randomly remember they're supposed to care about those sorts of things...well, let's just say I've discovered some things about my preferences that I don't think I'll ever be accepted for or that I'll be comfortable with (no, I'm not a pedophile XD my preferences are all of legal age). The things I would have to sacrifice, the comfort zone bubbles I would have to pop, the amount of compromises I would need to make, and most importantly, how much I would have to *bother* someone else to become anything more than their friend...

Well, what's the point? I don't want to bother anyone. ",16Mar2017,3
10,"So today in class I had a nervous breakdown after my teacher asked me what I wanted to do with my life. All I've ever wanted was to race in F1, and as soon as I told him that, he destroyed that for me. He told me not only the fact that my parents wouldn't approve or give me the money required to get into racing (teacher was a family friend, and knows my parents. I also brought it up a few times and my parents didn't approve). So I have no hope for that in the future, and that's the one thing I've wanted to do all my life. I have nobody else to rely on. Most of my friends are either dead, or untrustworthy assholes, so I can't rely on them. And the love of my life, the one person who helped me through the deaths of my closest friends, ended her life 9 months ago, and I constantly feel like it's my fault. She didn't show any outward signs of being suicidal, and then she just ended her life without a word. Since then, I've lost any drive to do anything. I don't have anybody I trust to talk to. This is my final effort to get some help, and I'd appreciate it if you guys could do so. Thanks in advance. ",16Mar2017,2
12,"No matter what the video is or what it entails, every time I watch an onboard lap or GP footage of F1 post 2014 you get these fucking whining ass bitches: 

""ehehsugh they're StiLL nOt as good as the v10s!!!1!1""
""haha they sound like vacuum cleaners ROFL""

Okay, I get it! The V10s sounded fucking amazing, alright? I'm not denying that. But when the fuck are you gonna get over the fact that they're gone? The V10s have been GONE for 11+ years. 

Not only that, the newer V6s from 2017 are fucking powerful. they're just as powerful as the V10s. Some of the TESTING laps are faster than previous years qualifying laps. 

If you're going to say ""oh I'm not watching F1 because they don't sound cool"" you're doing two things:

1. you're literally using the mentality of a 12 year old,
2. you're ignoring the whole point of F1, which is the RACING, not the sound.
3. you're discrediting the past 13 years of hard work by the engineers to make faster and more efficient cars

Anyway, I spread my legs and I started smearing my feces all over the head of my penis, and it got inside the hole.  I took a shower to wash it off but several hours later, there is still a disgusting odor coming from inside, and I think it got infected.  I even tried urinating and the smell still wouldn't come out.

My girlfriend won't give me a blowjob because she says the smell is so bad.  I feel like I'm about to cry.

18,"My family has decided to use one service (let's just say company B) to help with the ash scattering of a loved one. I had already acquired the service of another (company A) before they went with the second option. Although they had asked me to cancel the service of the other, I worry that something may go awry and leave us with no option. In short, I still have company A as a back-up but I have not told said company whether or not we will use their services on the planned date but I will eventually have to check in with them.

With regards to company A, I have already made an initial deposit - the money doesn't actually matter to me but there might be some that may feel it is important. I do not wish to offend them by wasting their time by not showing up (or giving the impression that we will absolutely do so). Services of this kind seems to be rather difficult to schedule with parties larger than 6 people so I do not wish to burn bridges in case we need to use their services again. Additionally, it's a jerk move to do this to people who are just trying to do their job.

At the same time, I am afraid they may try to cancel the service if we tell them we may not be there. I absolutely need them as a second option in case the first one doesn't pan out for whatever reason.

In all cases, I fully intend to pay company A the full amount for the services regardless or not we use them.

What is the best way to approach this in a professional business manner? Or from other perspectives?

Thank you very much in advance. Will also be posting this in other subreddits as well.

**edit** - I decided to call up company A and explain the situation in full detail as well as my intention to pay for their time and service, regardless if they were going to be used.  The reaction seemed more cautious and less enthused, which is understandable.  They had asked me to try to call them and update around 12 PM to 1 PM on that specified date so they can inform their people (so they do not have to stand about with nothing to do) if things all go well with company B.  It is likely they are being cautious in the case I do not follow through with payment, which is reasonable from their position.   They were very courteous and professional the entire way through.  I fully intend to follow through with reimbursement.

21,"So I tried posting to /r/askscience .... but they're really picky over there, apparently. Don't even think my post got submitted.

Maybe someone here will have a little insight. What I was wondering was this: Is a significant portion of the instances of depression the symptoms of an unhealthy lifestyle? 

I struggle frequently with social anxiety, and sometimes in my life I think I am showing symptoms of depression. Never been diagnosed, or even asked a doctor about this stuff. I know that some people medicate because of these mental illnesses, but I hear about both positive and negative experiences medicating. 

Here's the thing:

I've only recently considered getting medication, but I always wonder: **what if my case of anxiety and/or depression is caused by an unhealthy lifestyle and patterns of thought, and treating it chemically would be addressing the symptoms and not the cause?**

I have about the worst and least consistent sleep schedule of anyone I know, sometime bouts of drinking, I don't really give thought to what I eat, and I have very negative patterns of thinking.

Any thoughts would be helpful, thanks.

Also, to anyone who took the time to read this, don't be worried about my well-being. I'm doing fine most of the time these days, but when I start thinking about myself too much around others my brain just screams ""FLEE"" and it makes me completely unable to enjoy interacting with others. And sometimes I just have inescapable thoughts about how I am incredibly unhappy with my life. But that's only sometimes! Most of the time things are fine haha.  ",16Mar2017,4
23,"Male Friend sleeps at irregular hours, which causes him to miss our lunch/meet-up appointments frequently. He's always sorry afterwards but the thing is that he isn't staying up for work or anything, but rather for gaming. Was considering a relationship with him, but should I take this to mean he doesn't treasure me or put me in his sights at all if he can casually oversleep even when I'm really eager to meet him? 


I feel as though I'm being too emotional about this, and it doesn't seem something reasonable to call a deal breaker if we do decide to get into a relationship.

28,"So the deal is, i visiting an out of town friend a week ago, and while there i joined a party with his friends. 
I did not particularly enjoy myself as these people were very different than i am but still i powered through, and spent most of my time on my phone. 
When i came home i got a facebook message from one of the girls that i had taken enticing photos behind her back, i found this claim to be rather ridicoulus as i did no such thing. I had taken two snapchat pictures, one of the entire group, and one where she play pretend beat up my friend.  She asked me to delete them and so i did, also showed her picture proof that i did. 
She sent another message a while later and said she had a witness of me taking pictures of her behind in the kitchen. I told her i did spend some of my time in the kitchen and apologized if it seemed like i was taking pictures specifacilly of her, while i was using snapchat. She did not budge and said that i now reacted in a way which it was obvious i took deliberate pictures of her. 

I did not respond and hoped that the exchange would be over now. Fast forward to today, where i get a message from her boyfriend threatening to go to the police or my former army superiors (for some reason) if i did not apologize. And this guy also appearantly had loads of witnesses of me doing stuff like that.

I tried telling him that it was all just a big misunderstanding, and that the rumour probably has being going around their group of friends this last week and therefore the story has been more and more embellished. 

There is no response as of now, but i am rather scared. As i know they dont have a case i am absolutely innocent, but i also know how this country handles these kind of cases in the media, and i would be plastered all over the newspapers and news even when proven innocent.

36,"I woke up late, and work was rough. I left knowing I had to get $400 of repairs done on my brand new car, and I was especially bummed because I had to use the money I had been squirreling away for the past few months to buy the Nintendo Switch. I have a decently low income, so saving $50 here and there was a lot for me. I even had to sell my Wii U to get some money for the repairs.

I love Zelda!! It's my favorite video game franchise, and I've gotten almost every game on launch since OoT. All of my friends had gotten the new game either for switch or Wii U, so I was feeling a little jealous and left out, I'll admit.

After stopping at my trusted car shop, I found out my car actually didn't need any repairs at all, and the other shop I took it to was trying to scam me!! I'm an auto-ignorant girl, so this is common for me. But oh holy shit. Thank Hylia. That would have been rough. I was thinking, at least I can save this money.

A really great friend of mine works at the Gamestop on the way home one day per week, so I decided to stop in just to say hi and see him. After chatting with him and his manager for a bit, I joked around about the Switch and his manager asked ""so how bad do you want one?""

Apparently, one hour before I stopped in, the UPS driver came in and delivered a SINGLE Nintendo Switch to the store. So, I bought it and a copy of Breath of the Wild!

I couldn't believe it. I still can't. I was able to play my favorite franchise again, and it felt so amazing. I forgot how much roaming the ""Hyrule Field"" helped calm me down. I've been going through a rough time lately.

40,"First of all, I'm quite in agreement with Adam Conover in that there is [no such thing as a millenial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HFwok9SlQQ). Generations are made-up divisions. They're like someone drawing lines to mark up different portions of a river. Some people say ""The water flowed much better when I was upstream,"" and ""These upstreamers today are always flowing the wrong way and going on the wrong currents."" Marketers, on the other hand, say ""How can we reach these upstreamers? We downstreamers need to find a way to win them over, so we can sell them our shit.""

How do you win millenials over? Stop calling them millenials. Take down these bullshit lines you've drawn in the sand and accept that the people you're describing are somewhere between 10 to 30 years younger than you, not a different species. We don't think differently, better or worse than you do.

We've grown up with different technology, sure, and those of us young people in the west are probably going to be a lot more proficient in using computers than our parents and grandparents. But this is where the differences end.

We're people, who want to live our lives, not some special collection of young people who are constantly connected to each other on the closed-loop of social networks, organically attached to our phones and pop-culture references. We're not some unique demographic who you have to pore over a flipchart and have focus groups and meetings to understand the unique and special way we think, and conduct studies to determine how we'll respond to your marketing. We're fucking people.

The minute you stop using this bullshit term ""millenials"", which automatically implies that we're something different to you, is the minute you begin to understand us. The day you ""win us over"" is when you accept that there is no ""us"". We're different people, with different tastes and interests, and sure, we might like to do somewhat different things than our parents and grandparents do, but that's natural. The world changes, and we change with it. All we want - all anyone wants - is to have their voice respected and valued.

I'm sick of the PTSD, yes I have treatment, therapy every week, more pills than I ever thought possible, and it's been 6 years and it still remains there, those 6 days burned into my brain constantly. At night I wake in fear, night after night, and I awake to *him* there, standing over me with that cane. That cane that was a tool used to break people. It was a tool used to break me. He didn't need it to walk. That was a farce, he could move just fine without it. 

It was on a trip to Portland, April 1st 2011, to just explore. He found me and drugged me. He copied my writing structure in text to reply to the safety texts, he held a gun to my head in the event I got a safety call, and for 6 days I was trapped there. Tied up. Torture, mutilated- My back sliced up... That cane... He choked me with it. He raped me with it. He raped me with it so bad I will never be able to physically engage in anal sex again, even if I want to. He stole money. And all of this, after I escaped his grasp, broken and in shock... He got away scott free. I stumbled into the E.R. They did rape kits. They took photos. They found me a spot a hotel, and had the cops meet me there. The cop there, he blew me off. He told me he wouldn't go to the residence this happened at, even though he saw the wounds he said it must have been just a domestic dispute, and he refused to get the rapekit and photos from the E.R. He told me since I wasn't from there and my ID said I was male (I'm transgender, passing), I wasn't even a priority... 

I know I should have sued. I know I should have done something,  but I was too scared. I got out of there as fast as I could and I couldn't go back, not for life or money. The perpetrator was arrested a few weeks later on a strangulation charge... But that's all I've seen since. I hate myself for doing nothing after everything, I hate myself for being so afraid... But I'm transgender, I'm autistic, and I just couldn't handle facing it any further... The only resolution I had at all was a call apologizing from the DA a couple of years later on how they handled the case...

For as long as I can remember, everything I try to consciously think in my head it gets interrupted by a what feels like a sudden burst of pressure in my head. My head feels heavy and I then am unable to finish my thought and start feeling emotionally down. Not only that, but my ability to speak gets affected too. I start slurring my words and stutter. It takes a long time, from an hour to a whole day to fully recuperate from this. If I'm lucky, then the heaviness and symptoms that go along with it will fade away immediately, but that's often not the case. 
This is so frustrating for so many reasons. I can feel my being, as weird and out there and outlandish as That sounds, WANT to make thought and opinions in my head but it gets pushed back automatically and it then makes me feel like utter shit. I've tried to just not think but it just doesn't seem natural. 
I'm watching shows that I enjoy and then I notice something that intrigues me and I want to think about it with words but then bam, as I'm about to spew it out, it's too late. My head is heavy and I can NO longer enjoy the show. 
What is up with me? I know this isn't normal, and it's manageable enough, but sometikes I feel like its wounding me every time it happens. 
I do not know where to post this, so I posted it here because it seems people from all walks of life come here and maybe some will have experience or knowledge on how what and how to fix this.",16Mar2017,2

Economic troubles and over-reliance on cheap labor - Check 

Populist leader that promises to fix all - Check 

Government corruption and political instability - Check?

Irreconciliables differences between conservatives and progressive parties - Check?

Elimination of checks and balances - Not yet, but that's the floodgate.

59,"I would like to read some advice about how can I find something to talk about while playing video games, here is my video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d3O5Q7wDGU originally I recorded this video for about a hour.... But when I looked at it and Tried to pick only the times I had something relevant/funny/interesting to talk about or just something that is supposed to be shown in the gameplay, the video got shortened to 23 minutes... I would really appreciate if you people could check this video out and help me with a good relevant advice. Thank you :)",16Mar2017,1
60,"I find that I'm conflicted.

I see the community of the town I am in and realize that this isn't the only one.

Everyone moves to fast, cost of living is often too high, things are generally underwhelming or the opposite.
Theft and shooting, everything you might expect.
Streets that are barely taken care of; that make me wish I just had a helicopter.


It's no longer a question of why it's like this. We all know why and we often complain about how it is. But, not many of us take time to slow down and go any further.

I'm here because I want to change this. I want to re-imagine community from the ground up. It is now 2017 and I don't think I'm alone when I say that I feel further apart from other people and ""my neighbor"" than I'm almost willing to say any generation I've ever experienced talking with.

I prefer in-person interactions and yet so many are so overfed and rushed by life that they feel they have no time. But, this is where it is wrong. Everyone has resorted to using a smartphone. I am 23 years old and I have a CCNA, but I hate smartphones and what they have done to us. Now we seem to expect each other to move at the speed of our devices and communications.
Many can acknowledge that it is wrong for it to be this way.
