12,"So, long story short, I for some reason, can never remember a time when I have been depressed or sad. I can definitely get annoyed, and irritated. Never do I get angry or sad. I can be tired, I can be indifferent, and I can for sure empathize with animals and people who are hurt in videos and movies, but it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äòthat sucks‚Äô instead of genuine sadness. I‚Äôm a 21 year old male, and I got my first girlfriend this past summer and everything was great. After about 5 months, I said I love you for the first time and she broke up with me short after the fact. I tried to be sad but honestly ended up being happy realizing that if she wasn‚Äôt happy, I probably just saved myself time. Overall feeling was: ‚ÄúThat sucks, but oh well‚Äù  However, the ‚Äúthat sucks‚Äù feeling is very brief and I go back to the normal up and happy me. 

Another fun fact is that I definitely have Musical Anhedonia. I don‚Äôt get anything out of music. Idk if that matters but figured I‚Äôd throw that in there. 

Anywho, if a friend is going through something in their life that‚Äôs emotionally tolling, such as death in the family, life sucks in general, break ups, etc. It‚Äôs hard for me to relate. I obviously think it‚Äôs great that sadness isn‚Äôt really something I feel, but I just don‚Äôt understand -why- I don‚Äôt feel it. Maybe if I knew why, I could relate better? Idk. Anyways, I don‚Äôt know if this is the right place to post, but I just figured I would post here.

15,"So less than 30 minutes ago I saw a really big housefly in my dormitory (shared hall, bathroom, and kitchen with 6 people). I didn't want it to starve, be stuck there, or have one of my flatmates kill it, so I opened the door to the stairs and tried calling it. It didn't come so I walked up to where it was sitting, put my finger next to it, and the little fellow hopped onto my finger :)

I opened the door, went down 3 flights of stairs, and brought it outside and the fly didn't hesitate to trust me. I thought it might fly away, but it didn't. I put my finger near the wall outside and the fly calmly hopped onto the wall. 

The temperature outside is very similar to the hall, so it should be fine. I brought some pieces of fruit outside for it. I think it already flew away, but hope it has a happy life.

Anyway, I still feel really honored, and wanted to share what happened. The fly trusting me really made my day and warmed my heart. :)",15Dec2017,10

Every hour I've struggled not to think about what my grades might be. It's been a large source of anxiety, and it's been like this for roughly four days now. 

Today I finally got the results for two of my classes. My worst fears proved false, and each class reported scores better than I was excepting. On the one hand, I feel **much** better because the results I have are good. 

On the other hand, my last two classes could still very well determine how soon I might be able to graduate. I'm still anxious for my last two grades. Logically,  considering my progress before the final, I should hear good news soon. Emotionally, I'm still very anxious.

Well, I recently submitted my Honours thesis, and I asked my supervisors about whether I should try to publish it in an academic journal (as I really want to do that-it'll help ALOT for future admission to postgrad courses, and open up scholarship opportunities).


So they let me know I need to email them my data and statistical analyses to them, and reach back to them in mid-January (as they have summer break coming up) to discuss publishing it.


So, at this very moment; I am just organising my data sets and am going to convert them to a .zip file, to attach in the email.


I will then organise my goals and deadlines for the rest of this month; so I am leading an active, meaningful and happy life; post-Honours. Also, this is actually my 2nd Honours degree in a row, so I am going to contact my supervisor from last year to see if she still thinks I should publish my previous Honours thesis too! That'd be great!


After writing up my goals and deadlines, I will drive home (at my University's library right now) and then go on a track walk with my dad for exercise!

23,"There's no other way to put this, but I feel like I'm bad at being a person, no matter how irrational that sounds. I'm in college and I'm blowing it miserably. My anxiety is so bad that I'm scared of my own shadow. It's prevented me from making close friends, hanging out with people, eating, and basically just living without fear. I procrastinate so much that I can't meet a deadline to save my life, and it's affected my grades, since I feel like I can't manage more than one thing at a time without everything falling apart. I'm tired of watching people around me juggle school, work, hobbies and friends effortlessly while I just can't seem to get it together. It feels like I'm living a half-life, and it's lowered my self-esteem to the point where I feel like I'm not worth much. I'm in therapy trying to fix it, but I feel like I'm incapable of doing normal things and it's very depressing. 

My parents aren't supportive either (probably shouldn't have expected them to be, given their abusive history but it still would've been nice) and when I try to explain how I'm feeling, they just ridicule me, saying that I'm a screw-up who will never get married and that I'll probably end up in a ditch dead somewhere due to my own stupidity. I can't come to them with anything because they usually only scream at me, which leads to me crying (and I'm so tired of crying). I'm just tired of never being good enough and being stressed out. 

It's funny, because no one else knows any of this. People assume I'm that smart, that I have things in order and that I've got a great life ahead of me, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Two years ago in high school, I was on top of my game‚Äî and now I'm just incompetent, burnt out, and empty inside. How do I function like a normal adult, without feeling so lost all the time?

Chances are, it won't work like this. The majority of the change you will see is going to be behind the scenes. They'll start charging sites, not the consumer. The cost might be passed down to you but it's unlikely to see a very significant increase. You'll also see different types of traffic throttled, such as P2P file transfers and streaming software, but not much that affects the average user, and the average user is the most important user.

The problem I see is when people shout from the rooftops that NN repeal is going to ruin the internet as you know it, and that *doesn't* happen (at least in that way), the average person is going to go ""hey, you guys were wrong, maybe this *was* the right decision,"" without ever looking into the actual impacts of the issue.

32,"So...I posted about this sometime ago, but the moderators locked my thread advising me to post on r/self.


Hello, if you read my last posts, you know the hell I got out last month (dating a girl with huuuuuuge red flags). So after that I decided giving tinder another try, but it seems I can't arrange any dates this time of year, and the girls whose number I got, started giving their red flags already. On another post I asked what to do about each one...since most of the girls stop answering back if you don't get a date after one week (100% rule till now), but most of them are busy af this time of year. 

Actually one seems already to have a fucking problem with my height (she is 1.53M while I'm 1.78M and the guy she last dated was 1.93M) idk why cuz she is almost a fcking midget (joking...she is cute af). 


Soooo...most of the answers I got from my last post, told me to move on. Since I only got good things till now following reddit's advice (100% life improvement after telling that crazy girl I was dating last month to GTFO). So...I always had a problem with girls...I find them too much complicated and the ""game"" something totally bs. My first relationship was with my childhood best friend [23M], when I was 12 (he was 11 when we started it) till I was 16 years old. Our relationship was never public cuz obvious reasons...but I started doubting if I was really into guys at 14 when I made out with another childhood friend [24F]. At the same time I was a weirdo in high school...despised by most of the girls cuz I was fat (studied on a expensive private high school, so most of the girls were spoiled brats), but I never gave a fuck cuz there was only one person whose this kind of opinion mattered to me. So I was in doubt...then the friend which I was having the relationship moved to another city to start university and we ""broke up"". Then I had this weird relationship with my sister's friend [23F] when I was 18. First semester of engineering school and then we had sex. It felt nicer than with a guy. That moment I realized I was straight, and since then I only had relationships with girls (once I made out with a guy while studying abroad in Germany but I was drunk af). Since my first girl, I started taking care of myself (hit the gym, lost tons of weight, started dressing better, got a nice and clean hair cut and beard shave, was top of the class on most of subjects. The thing is, since I went to study abroad in Germany, that girl left me and I started using tinder. Got 4 relationships but none of them lasted more than a couple months. 

I stopped going on nighclubs at 21 cuz I was sick of them. So tinder was my only way to find girls to date (sometimes one night stand). Initially I thought that the problem was the fact that I would eventually go back to my country and this was a problem fro them. Till I got a gf in my country using tinder after I came back. So 3 months, things started getting weird...she was kinda obsessed with me sleeping on her place. When I didn't she send mad texts to me and apologize after...around 4 months, I asked for a time, cuz my grandma died before I could see her after my comeback from Germany and I was falling into depression(she lived very far away and I already had bought tickets to visit her during summer break).


So, the next week I went to talk with my gf cuz I thought I was being an asshole and I should apologize and move with our relationship normally...funny thing...my ""friend"" (one of my university colleagues that was rejected by my gf's sister) was there...5-10cm (idk his penis size) inside her. After that I just ignored every single girl in the world and even my younger sister [22F]. Around 10 months later I started to move on, and wanted to give another shot...so tinder it is. And then I found that psycho from my other posts that even gave me nightmare...I probably must have developed Stockholm Syndrome).


Finally free from that burden after 1 month....I again wanna give another shot, and got matched with 3 amazing girls at once...or so I thought....


I'm just tired of the amount of BS you need to get through to get a decent relationship...I hate this ""game"" bs that we need to play in order to get a date...I hate being the only one left behind (all my friends are engaged, I really don't have single friends anymore) just because I decided to study abroad for 2 years...I hit the gym, I take the utmost care of my appearance, I do my best to overcome my social anxiety, I try to not give a fuck and play the ""game""...but it is just not enough and I don't know why....it seems that is impossible to get dates with normal girls...cuz I need to fight for my space against 300 different guys that she puts in friendzone. I really don't understand what is wrong with me. The thing I liked about guys, was that I could understand them...most of the girls are an unstable emotional bomb that doesn't care to put you in an rollercoaster of emotions just to make themselves feel better. I can't describe how difficult it was to move on after denying every single girl for 10 months...not only emotionally, but physically also (I didn't have sex in the last 10 months but I'm only feeling the urge now). I can't fucking get what is in a girls mind...I can't be honest with girls...I need to play the fucking ""game""...why? Guys are so much simpler. But still...I'm totally 100% sure that I'm into girls (emotionally and physically)... 


I don't see girl as prizes for playing the ""game"" (I actually don't even try to play it, but the girls drag me to it) ...I just think the game as some stages you need to get through to reach an status till the girl considers you as bf material. So...the big questions are: 


1- What am I doing wrong and what can I do to fix it?


2- I can't stand nightclubs, nor the girls who go to it, but tinder seems not to be a good option also. University doesn't have many girls also cuz engineering. So where would I most likely meet decent girls?


3-Why the fuck a 1.53m tall girl has a problem with my height (1.78m)?


I hit the gym everyday, I'm one of the top students on my university, I try to be nice to everyone and always look for new hobbies and stuff to make me more interesting to people (I play violin, train Krav Maga, play basketball and soccer), but for some reason I can't get even to dates with girls I've matched on tinder (I don't have much time to hang out, and as all my friends are engaged in serious relationships, I'm by myself on the single-man-life).

Let me give some context on why I was so proud of myself. In school, I'm not exactly popular. Yeah, I'm a bit of a class clown, but I'm not respected or anything like that. So for me to be onstage, in front of about 150 people, and to keep my balls between my legs, that... that felt incredible.

48,"This is not an exciting story. I know it is long, but I hope at least one person reads it. 

Somewhere around 2009, I met a girl on a shady ""hot or not"" style website. I was about 28 at the time, and she was about 21. It wasn't long before our friendship transcened its shady origin and we were chatting regularly. We lived about 8 hours apart, so the friendship stayed exclusively text based for a while.

When I first met her, she lived in a house with a bunch of people. Shortly after I remember her sharing a house with two guys with the same first name. She mentioned that one of them was an ex-boyfriend who she was still friends with. At some point she moved into an apartment with just that ex. It always seemed like they were just friends.

By the next year, we were really getting a long. Conversions would often be flirty, and sometimes beyond. That summer I found out that work would be sending me on a two month rotation, and I would be about half the distance closer to her. We thought this might be a chance to meet up.

But before that happen, she tells me she has started seeing someone, someone she met on the same website. She flew out to visit him and by the time I was on my rotation, she was calling him her boyfriend. We were still friend, but less flirty, and we decided to meet up anyway. 

I drove down to meet her, and we spent the afternoon together. Things were going well, but after a few hours, she ended it somewhat abruptly. I was starting to assume it was all over then, but she assured me she thought our friendship was actually more legit now. She said she was just feeling anxious and wanted to go home. As an anxious person, it made sense.

The relationship with the boyfriend did not last long, and we soon went back to being flirty. Things kinda fell into a grove. We would talk about meeting up again, but it would never actually come together. Things turned from flirty to affectionate over the years, but we still chatted almost every day. We had our jokes, we'd vent our frustations to each other. We spent a lot of time talking about our sports teams. She was a great friend to always have a text away.

This past January was the last time that things got very flirty. In March she told me she was going anxienty medicine. Shortly after she was less responsive via text. Maybe it was the meds. Or maybe after nearly a decade of this we didnt need to talk every day. At some points I enterained the idea that maybe she had a secret boyfriend. As far as I knew, we had both been awkward, anxious, mostly single people for years.

I've had an issue with people accidently using my email address. I've seen online reciepts, I've been reminded of doctors appointments, I've recieved payment reminders for auto loans. It started happening again. I was getting medical information for someone with the same name in another state. I searched the internet for my name, hoping to find out who this name-sharer is. I was surprised to find out just how common my name is. Out of curiousity I started searching for the names of friends with less common names to see what kind of results their names bring up. Hers was the third one I tried.

The fourth result was a baby registry. Her name. Her town. The father has the same first name the ex-boyfriend roommate. I remember that she has a cousin with the same exact name, maybe it is her. I search his name to see if he is who I think he is. A Facebook profile comes up. His name. His town. A picture of the two of them. And right there on the public facing profile, engaged since the spring of 2015.

I wrestle with it all weekend. Years ago she mentioned using a fake engagement ring to prevent getting hit on at work. Maybe this was like that. Maybe the enganement ring wasn't fake after all. I chat with her that weekend as if I know nothing. I don't know what to say. I don't know how real all of this is.

For some reason I check his Facebook profile again Monday morning. There is a new profile picture. The last one is two years old. The new one is just three hours old. It‚Äôs the two of them, smiling, happy. And she is clearly pregnant. A comment makes it sound like they have been together since before I knew her. I always knew she didn't really tell her friends about me, but now I see I might be something she hides from her fianc√©. 

I send her a message letting her know what I stumbled upon. I let her know that I appreciate our friendship, but that I also understand that this a good breaking off point if this has gone on for too long. I let her know that I‚Äôm not expecting a response now, or if it is better for her, she doesn‚Äôt need to respond at all. I congratulate her, and thank her for the good times. She hasn‚Äôt responded. 

There are a lot of ways I can unpack this, but in all of them, the person I am now missing may never have existed. It‚Äôs not surprising when the real life of an internet friend turns out to be different than you imagined, but this is something more than that. 

For now I wonder what her motivations were. I feel like she had told me all the details up until the the big ones. She even told me about a doctors appointment that is probably when she found out she was pregnant. Was she hoping I would ask ‚Äúwhat for?‚Äù The pieces don‚Äôt fit.

The nearest bus stop is located on the mountain). I was too cold to even move my body while waiting for the bus, so he fixed my shoelaces for me.
God, how could I still remember that?
I was so drunk so I just kinda collapsed on his bed constantly talking shits about how everyone left everyone and he just smiled while patting my head.
‚ÄúThatLamePumpkin, I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm not gonna leave.‚Äù
After a lot of crying from me and one very vague confession from him, we ended up sleeping with each other. 
I was drunk and he didn‚Äôt drink.
The problem? He was already in a very committed, 6-year long relationship.
After that, we just couldn‚Äôt face each other anymore and it didn‚Äôt take long for everyone to notice how the atmosphere between us had changed drastically.
They started to talk behind my back, like how I seduced him and ruined his perfect relationship (his girlfriend is a controlling psychopath - his close friends all knew it but people didn‚Äôt). I got mad because he didn‚Äôt try to defend me so after that, whenever anyone asked what happened between us, I vaguely implied that ‚Äòsomething‚Äô happened. 
We stopped talking since then. Full on stop, like blocking each other on every social media stop.
Now it has been almost a year, I still miss him everyday - he is always the first thing I think of every morning - and I understand that the only I could win him back is to apologize sincerely for smearing shits all over his good guy reputation.
Do you guys think I should apologize? If I should, then how should I start?",15Dec2017,18
54,"To begin‚Ä¶ 

  I am really an unimportant person as of right now, not that I hope to be an important person. I am altogether not sure of what to make of what other people think of me, or my status as it relates to my peers. In fact there is not much I can say with certainty regarding my future, economically speaking. I don‚Äôt intend to amount to anything. I write because it is the best I can do. It might be the only thing at which I mildly excel. This is not because of my exceptional vocabulary, or my commanding syntax, or my visionary elaboration. My ability is borne of emotion: tragedy, pain, grief, isolation, depression, among other feelings. If you are willing to undergo such sentiments, in extraneous amounts, and blessed with the ability to express those feelings in whatever artistic manner that suits your personality - then you can begin again‚Ä¶ ",15Dec2017,1

58,"Last night we had a little christmas party at a friends house. I knew a few people but most were new to me. One of the games we would play was Dirty Santa (sometimes called White Elephant or Yankee Swap). If you've never heard of it, the rules of the game are that everyone has brought a wrapped gift and after drawing a number from a hat, you go in turn with either taking a gift from the pile or stealing a previous gift. If you steal a gift, the person you stole from gets to either steal another gift or draw from the pile.

There were a number of really good and really terrible gifts (e.g. an ironing board) but the 'most wanted' gift last night was a google home and I wanted it. Bad. I've been eyeing them for a while, but money is tight and I can't really afford to buy one on my own.

I was somehow lucky enough to be the last person to go and I had my eye on the prize. I go to steal it and the older woman who had it last would not give it up. I'm trying to laugh it off because it's awkward and I really thought she was joking, but no. She starts swearing, telling me ""I'm not going to take her fucking prize"" and gets up and walks out of the room. Tension and awkwardness is thick, she ends up going home and we're all just sitting there wondering what the fuck just happened. It's the end of the game, I just want it to be over and I end up with the ironing board.

Honestly, I'm pissed. I would have absolutely loved to have that but one lady decided to say to hell with the rules and good natured fun.",15Dec2017,72
