2,"It's difficult to describe this sensation. I could be in the middle of a conversation with someone, or otherwise awake and active, and then suddenly get a disorienting sensation where it's like I'm waking up and need a few moments to adjust to my surroundings. It's like a future version of myself has gone back in time and respawned in that moment, and I need a few moments to work out what's happening, like when you wake up after being asleep. It's happened to me since I was a child, about once or twice a year.

Does anyone else experience this? It's definitely a physiological sensation, not psychological, but I couldn't find any info on it. I don't have epilepsy or any mental condition.",08Jul2017,2

5,"This is frustrating. He and I are in the same program at uni. He's been texting me non stop telling me he is determined to get all five labs done before fall semester and in part  doesn't want to attend lab sessions where the TA will actually help him. These are MATLAB labs. I told him what he needs to study to get ready for the class and that he would be better off by doing this. He doesn't listen.


The thing is, I feel it is not fair for him to do this because I did attend most 730am labs so I could get some help. My brother who is engineer also helped me. I just don't think it's fair at all. I just don't know how to say no to him because he also has sort of helped in the past.",08Jul2017,13
9,"I'm cross posting this from r/depression because I didn't get any responses.

I have a history of depression, and I've been through the treatment process.  I know all about what depression feels like, what to do to combat it, what I'll feel like when I'm better, what to expect, etc.  I just feel line my brain is wrapped in cotton and I can't shake it though, no matter what I do.  I'm exercising, getting out, hanging with friends, smoking pot sometimes, drinking others, occasionally pursuing women (though that's recently been very discouraging), spending time with siblings, eating well, etc.  You get the point, I'm living healthily.

I just can't get over how alone and sad I feel.  My freshman year of college was spent single and with attempts (at varying degrees of success) to mingle, though I dislike that lifestyle, except for the one girl I actually dated, began to fall for, but had to dump because she cheated on me (which hurt like a train because she treated me so so so well and loved me in ways my prior ex didn't).  I've spent the summer wanting to but not really able to meet new people, and have met this one girl, but it's hit a wall because she won't answer my DMs after she expressed interest in hanging out with me and my friends (she hasn't actually read them, so I'm in the weird spot of not having lost hope but I'm feeling really shitty about it).

My closest friends are either emotionally distanced (because of their own issues), emotionally mature but a little (annoyingly) caught up in her own current fling, very emotionally immature, or in rehab.  I'm pretty much left alone to my own thoughts, except for the few times I can talk to them - but often doesn't end in anything but petty sympathy for specific circumstances (I haven't really talked about my state of mind in general, because the girl aforementioned kinda more or less has it worse off mental health wise and I don't know how I feel bringing up my issues in relation to her, even though she's typically the most helpful).  I don't wanna talk to my family because I'm supposed to have been fixed by now, and for other reasons that can basically be summed up as ""I never had depression, it was my mentally ill mother who caused everything"" (which is pretty valid).

I don't know what to do, I just want people to talk to who I can be real with and actually discuss my problems with.  I don't want a pitty party, and I do actually want suggestions for tangible solutions that I'll act on, I just don't ever seem to feel the recognition from anyone that this shit is *rough* and isn't just a minor getting laid, feeling down, or stress thing.  I don't really know anymore.

17,"Hey guys, 

I'm 19 years old and it feels like for the last couple of years I have been stuck going through the same thought patterns and ways of looking at life. I have adopted this supper negative mind-set, where I am constantly bringing myself down more so than I am trying to think in ways so that I can push myself forward. I am super negative towards my self and I am constantly putting myself down with thoughts like I'm not good enough, everyone thinks I'm a wierdo, I'm not like others, I don't deserve this.... blah blah blah, and this has lead to me not being able to do regular things without having these overwhelming negative thoughts. 
I have been told I am good-looking, smart, all of that, and that I have everything in life so I should be happy. Yet I just can't accept myself for who I am. I have a lot of friends, but when it comes to being alone in public I am completely consumed by negative thoughts of what others think of me, how others are so much better than me, and how others lives and their opinions matter so much more than mine. It's not like I have been put down to the point where I should believe negative things that people say about me, I just create so much bullshit and frustration for myself for absolutely no reason.

Over the last year I am proud to say I have become aware of my problems instead of being ignorant and pushing them aside like I used to. I am constantly reading about articles and trying to take steps so that I can better myself but I am not seeing results. I just want to be accepting of myself and be happy for what I have but being negative has become a part of me. I don't know how I can break this conditioning about how I view myself. I realized I was behaving this way for probably about 4 years but I now understand that its not normal and I really want to change. I feel like my personality has held me back in so many ways, and even when I do things that I know I want to do I can't be happy for myself and just turn a positive thing into more negative things.

Sorry for rambling but I have a lot to say and not sure how to phrase some things. I recently went to a counsellor for the first time and lately I have been trying to not let myself get in the way of my own happiness but I am always stuck in this conflicting uneasy state about myself and life in general. 

If anyone has any advice or insights, I would greatly appreciate it. ",08Jul2017,2

21,"Hello all! It's been a pretty tiring day so i figured i'd relax and tell you all about my youtube start, and how much it means to me. I think I was 11 when I made my first channel, it wasnt anything special but i pulled a couple hundred views per each hypercam recorded club penguin video lol. I was 11, cut me some slack. I had fun with it, until my siblings found it and teased me about it. It made me embarassed so i stopped uploading and left the channel entirely. I think a year later I made my second channel, based on minecraft. And wow was that a fucking mistake, i chose a name like MCModspotlighter, that shit sticks forever. I didn't care at the time. I put out minecraft content and amassed over 1k subs for mod spotlights. Around this time my parents divorced and it affected me really hard, so i left the channel alone for a while. We also moved so i couldnt really film if i wanted. So a long time later i return. My subs just didnt watch any of my new vids and it sucked. But whatever. I entered into a partnership with ""Fullscreen"" and it was for 4 years. I completed 2 of these years and decided it wasnt for me. Also i'm sorry about my shit grammar, i'm on the toilet lawl. So i tried getting out of Fullscreen but i signed a contract. I was pissed but i found a loophole. I forged my dad's signature on the contract so legally it wasn't binding. I had to send them a pic of my passport to confirm i was underage and i was free. It felt great. I needed a new identity though. I kept getting shit on for being called ""MCModSpotlighter"", so i needed a new name. I earned the nickname Salms at school from this thot who was joking around and it stuck. People just called me it in school and i was like ""ight okay"". Wasnt an insult or anything just a nickname i sorta got. So i used it, rebranded my channel, my profile pic and banner, and my name. My editing slowly got better and now i'm 16 putting out horrible content and streaming but im happy with how it turned out, I may not average 100k views, but as long as i can entertain people, idc how many views it gets. This may seem like advertising but I never really mentioned my story and i feel like it'd be interesting to read. Oh well though, i'll link the channel if you wanna watch. Moral of the story, don't name yourself MCModspotlighter, my channel still shows up if you search that, and it sucks lol.

23,"I have been so depressed the last few nights. Worse than usually. I would get home from work and just go to bed, not talking to anyone, not interacting with anybody. Just sleeping my days away. Tonight I was getting in bed at 6:00 pm and laid there just crying, hating my life. Then for some reason I told myself to get up and get dressed and look nice. I took a shower, I cleaned up and put on some nice clothes. I forced myself to go downtown, even though I really didn’t feel like it. I went for a walk and heard a live band playing at a local bar. I decided to go in and order a couple of drinks. I listened to some beautiful music while I enjoyed a few beers. I then decided to go dance with a group of people. I get out on the floor and start dancing to the music, enjoying myself for the first time in a long time. Then, out of nowhere, this beautiful woman came up to me and grabbed my arm and asked to dance. I couldn’t help but smile. I started dancing with her and it was amazing. We both knew swing dance and just swept the floor. That song ended and she smiled, then the next song came on and she continue to dance with me. The whole night, through the rest of the songs, this beautiful woman kept dancing with me. When the band finished their last song and started to pack up, she gave me a big, strong, and long, hug. I have been single for close to 5 years and this was the first time I’ve had someone hug me like that in a long time. I would have asked her out, but I was very positive she came there with another guy. I smiled, hugged her back and her and the guy left together. I ordered a few waters and sobered up before heading home with the largest smile on my face and a warm feeling in my heart. My night started off as a depressing mess and ended in one of the best nights I’ve had in a very long time. I doubt I’ll ever see that woman again, but I will be riding this high for a while. I just felt like I had to tell someone.

I misjudged the amount of space/how fast he was going and although I made it to the other side in time, I only had a couple seconds of wiggle room. The guy honked a few times as he passed by me. 

My first reaction when it happened was 'wow fuck this guy and fuck him for honking at me, I had plenty of space'. But really I didn't. And even after realizing that 'okay, maybe that was stupid,' I still feel pissed at the guy! Rationally, I know I fucked up, but I still can't help feeling like he was the asshole for honking at me. 

Anyway, it made me think of this guy's [reaction to getting caught stealing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/6llsil/guy_got_caught_stealing_bicycle_then_mouths_off/) It's the same psychology. He's clearly in the wrong, but I guess it's human nature to never think you are in the wrong.

41,"I might as well kill myself, not saying I will, but I find emotional fulfillment in other people. I find emotional fulfillment in my work too, but these are two different forms of fulfillment.

I currently have a girlfriend, she is extremely attractive and I enjoy spending time with her. Over my years I have engaged in sex with 9 women. I've come to the realization that you are only truly appreciated when you limit the time you spend with someone. When I was fucking around, these women showed me a lot of sexual affection/the best of themselves. My girlfriend doesn't do this anymore.

This isn't a problem, it's only natural. It's truly my fault. I spend too much time with her and it's inevitable that she would take me for granted. I'm not a huge fan of the idea that my girlfriend most likely entertains the thoughts of getting ravaged by the guy who shared the same attraction points that I did in the beginning. She doesn't hold my hand as much anymore, she doesn't kiss me as much in public anymore, she doesn't wear eyeliner anymore, and she told me she really only had sex with me because I liked it, and that she enjoyed it but it was primarily for me. In a way I'm happy for her, she's comfortable around me. But this doesn't bode well for my future, comfort is complacency and in this day and age it's only a matter of time before she doesn't want to be comfortable anymore. In order to keep this woman I have to maintain a constant balancing act of attraction/comfort. You may be telling yourself, why is he doing this? What's the point? That's no fun. But I want to let you know you're all playing the game, whether or not you know you are is the thing that sets you and I apart. 


It's impossible to be satisfied. I'd have to find romantic fulfillment in someone who I'd deem somewhat less attractive then I am, and would always think I'm worth keeping, and at the point I would just feel bad because she's putting so much effort in but I'd never feel the same. It's a losing game. I'd be happier dead.

my lust for her is insatiable,

the one thing she’s not is replaceable.

I always want more, never less,

with her i’ll reside, forever blessed.

but regardless i love you,
ill always trust you and never get enough of you.

 I’m easily irritated but your smile will always fade it. 

your happiness is my main concern, in turn all i ask is your love. 

your love is my food, my water, my everything. i need your heart to live, i want the whole thing. 

""I love you"" just isn’t enough,

but when i say it i never bluff.

you’re all i ever want in this world,

i just need you to be my girl.

I will do anything to stay with you,

through thick and thin I’ll always come through.

in my word you can always trust,

you won’t ever be left in the dust.

my poem skills aren’t top of the line,

but for you I’ll expend an attempt of mine.

i’ll love you forever, for you’re my b

i hope that’s something you can always see.

scared to try and miss, he cowers in fright.

he jumps and he fails, he wonders what’s wrong

he bumps and he bails, alone all along.

approached by a princess, he pokes his head out

in love in an instance, he’s joyful throughout

he spreads and flaps, only to find

the piece he was missing, was only just behind


it wasn’t ever missing, as it turns out

she just hadn’t been found yet, her warmth still about.

the princess was the piece, you finally see

 - it's cheap. There's a clause mentioning that flights only go up as soon as enough people died. That's okay, because everyone dies eventually! It's unreasonable to demand a solo flight, but that should be an option people could pay for. 

- Flights for whole groups also add the benefit that it would become much cheaper, so more people could use the service.

 - The room you'll need for coffins is literally free and virtually endless.

There's a girl in my group of friends who is (to me) extremely attractive. Recently I have been noticing that she has been flirting with me (or I see it in that way):

* At our prom she grabbed my arm as we were walking in, then later when we were out on a balcony together

* That night at the after prom she always swapped places with people to dance next to me (maybe just coincidence?)
* When talking about Uni (we're going to the same place) she said she hoped we were in the same flat so we could go to parties together

However, when I asked her friend about it she said that she isn't looking for anything at the moment (before uni).

This girl has had feelings for me before but that's a few years ago now so probably doesn't make a difference.

A big part of this though, is that there is a guy within the friendship group that is in love with her (not exaggeration) and she used to like him back (however things went sour between them).
