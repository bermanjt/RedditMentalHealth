0,"I work in the medical field. I’ve been having a lot of anxiety and panic lately and more and more it’s manifesting as anger. On Friday I snapped at a fellow coworker because I was stressed out and had just gotten an email from my supervisor about an incident where a nurse got hostile with me and it caused me to panic. I didn’t actually cuss or behave aggressive but I yelled and did say the word “shit”.

I’m currently under discipline because a patient complained about something I said in October. Long story short I tried to be helpful and offer advice and the patient took it as me not being 100% cheerful/happy so she complained. It actually surprised me because I had no idea I was coming off as anything other than personable. I do have resting bitch face and if I’m focusing on something I don’t smile and that I think actually added to her opinion. 

Anyway tl;dr I panicked and yelled and I’m afraid my coworker is going to say something and I’m going to get fired because I have a history of not playing well with others.

1,"There have been many times where I’ve posted something to a subreddit only to have it removed seconds later because I didn’t read the fine print of rule 4 subsection c or whatever. 
 


Has this happened to you? I even saw this happen to a guy over at adviceanimals the other day and he ended up posting a follow up meme because of it.



My first reaction was, when did that become a rule? Or even, why is that a rule? I’ve had this happen in small subreddits I’ve been apart of from the beginning and I completely disagree with the rule. 



So here’s my idea... why can’t there be a way for the subscribers of certain subreddits to vote on the rules. Or even proposed rulings? I’ve seen this sort of voting done in band/music subreddits trying to narrow down best song of an album. Why not let the subscribers that enjoy the subreddit get to have a say in what they care to see or not see? 



I bet I’ll break some Reddit rule when I hit “submit” to this post now..",31Dec2017,0
2,"My older sister and younger sister I can to an extent and even joke a bit but for some reason I never really get the urge to talk to them about things like say with my friends or coworkers. I'd say I'm pretty shy when it comes to girls but other than that I'm pretty outgoing in my life especially since I'm a server and that's kind of my job. 

Yet, family gatherings, birthdays, holidays, etc. I cantalk some what but I'm either on my phone or playing video games with my nephew, since I have the Nintendo Switch and usually just let him play it, most of the time. If I smoke weed I can definitely talk to older cousins or something because they do too, maybe even after a couple drinks but other than that, I can't really seem to reach out to my mom or dad. With my Dad, I'm a bit more relaxed because we go to the movies once a month or so and have that in common but with my mom I feel like I have nothing in common with her and feel a bit alienated from the whole conversation. I always feel bad I'm not talkative when she clearly wants to be. It's so wierd, I'm resenting my family but yet, not really because I'd do anything for them except talk to them casually.

5,"Brief recap: [[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/725b37/have_a_good_weekend_well_its_official_im_not/)] So three months ago I adopted a cat off my sister, who was dealing with her boyfriend (who she had just dumped) being impulsive and skipping the state. She was dealing with it as best as she could, but she couldn't keep the cat, so I, looking for a companion for my Deanna, took her in.

Unfortunately I was her third enormous change in three months, and she stopped eating and after a few days I took her to the vet who diagnosed her with hepatic lipidosis, and I left her in their care. Two days later presented me with two choices: put her down, or surgically install a feeding tube and see if she improved.

[[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/73i57u/update_have_a_good_weekend_well_its_official_im/)]

I got lucky that I was being helped out on the financial end of things, so after consulting with a friend who was getting her PhD in veterinary surgery, all of us involved concluded it was best to continue the feeding.

And she improved! Well enough that I could take her home and continue the tube feedings (with the help of family doing feedings while I was at work; couldn't have done it alone). And she kept improving. Eventually Kira developed enough energy to try and avoid feeding time, sometimes escaping with the syringe still attached to her tube.

Eventually she became more of a cat again, leaping, playing, having energy, and above all else, desiring neck scratches. I had a small breakfast-in-bed kind of table in the room to stage feeding syringes, and a couple a mornings I came in and found her having tried to scratch her ear against it and twisting her feeding tube around the other side of her neck. It gave us quite a scare, but [she didn't seem to care](https://i.imgur.com/TwrQhR4.jpg), and an investigation of the implantation site showed she hadn't yanked it out, so she was never in any real danger.

------

RECAP OVER! So eventually [she started eating dry food](https://i.imgur.com/uceIKPQ.jpg), and the tube came out, which meant I could start trying to integrate her with my other cat, Deanna, the [I MUST INVESTIGATE EVERYTHING](https://i.imgur.com/8eSH5qQ.gifv) jerk.

But I could socialize them! [It did not start well](https://i.imgur.com/bbVQUAN.jpg). Deanna wanted to play. Kira saw it as an attack. Thus Kira was unwilling to leave the space she knew, where all the hiding places were and high grounds she could reach. I enforced separation when I was away, but eventually she decided to start coming out, and [I caught her loafing in main room](https://i.imgur.com/DK62FIx.jpg). Then she caught a glance of Deanna up on the couch, and slunk away.

However, over the past few weeks I've been letting them spend more time together, and a little ways ago I started letting them be alone together. Deanna dialed back her ""attacks."" She'd leap on Kira, Kira would yowl, Deanna would leave.

Just today was a bit of a breakthrough. No yowling or growling, just running around. And then I caught Kira chasing Deanna, a thing that had never happened before. Ever. This was a shy cat I knew before the move, who hadn't an aggressive muscle in her body, who all of a sudden became the predator.

If she were an unfixed male I'd say she had just had her steel balls galvanized. I'm impressed with Kira. Not just for her recovery, but her growth. She was always a docile, unaggressive cuddle bug who'd rather be a lazy slug than interact with anyone. And here she is, after a near-death experience, chasing around one of the most clever cats I've ever known.

Deanna threw me for a loop, being like no cat I had ever known before. She left me confused. The mess with the hepatic lipidosis left me questioning my cat psychology skills, and the rocky integration didn't help. Now? Seeing this? I feel a lot better, knowing I haven't ruined a cat. Heck, I think she's better now, more energy, exhibiting more personality. She's come through the worst and turned out for the better.",31Dec2017,3
7,"I don’t know what to do. Everything hurts.

3 years ago, almost to the day, my best friend sexually assaulted me, and had been doing so while I slept for possibly months. I haven’t heard from him since I blocked him. I never called the police because I was scared I’d have to see him again and relive it. 

The night before yesterday I couldn’t sleep and was awake at nearly 4am. My phone starts ringing, No Caller ID. I answered it and stayed silent to see if it’s just a bot call. I thought it was call centre noises but it was moaning and masturbation. It definitely was. I hung up thinking it was background noise and they rang back. I said hello? And heard more moaning. I hung up. They rang back. I rejected it. And again. And again. 8 times. 

I had a panic attack, woke up my partner and was hysterical. I couldn’t get to sleep for hours.

It was definitely him. It had to be. Had to. I think it sounded like him. Why now? I was finally starting to be okay and now everything feels like it’s falling apart again.

I can’t block no caller id, I’ve had important calls from them and my work uses it in some cases. I have so many things linked to my phone number I don’t think I could change it. If he does it again I might have to.",31Dec2017,3
8,"We live 80 years or so if we’re lucky, in a world we don’t understand. We forget most things we do. When we die we are forgotten. When we die, there is no peace, we just suddenly cease to exist. We don’t even realise we have died. Nothing in this universe lasts forever.

I find it hard to accept that my brother doesn’t exist. How can an entire person become air and dust? I cannot believe he is just nothingness. He’s busy being no one, nowhere. 

There is no escape from living, I can’t even kill myself, my brother already did that. It would ruin my family. Even if I did try to escape all I would be remembered for is being a sad lonely weirdo. Only a few would even remember. 

How can I find a reason to live? How can I be like I was when I was young, and I didn’t think about these things? Maybe no one has the answers, I’m just tired of keeping it inside all day.",31Dec2017,6
10,So there's a person I'm currently in school with that I've known since I was like 13. We used to be really good friends but lately they've been really passive aggressive and have started just chipping away at my self esteem and pushing me out of our friend group. It's gotten to the point where I no longer feel welcome hanging out with my best friends because they're always there and even though some of our friends have noticed that they've started picking on me for no apparent reason none of them really do anything to stand up for me and I'm not sure how to move forward. This person is an integral part of the drama and choir programs that I'm involved in and is in a lot of what used to be my favorite classes and when I try to ignore them they go out of their way to call attention to every little thing I might do wrong. It makes me hate all the things I used to love but because they're so popular in these groups I'm not sure how to move forward and resolve these issues that we're having since when I've tried to broach the issue with this person and figure out how we can move forward not necessarily as friends but without all this tension and catty behavior they just shut me down and refuse to talk about what their problem with me is.,31Dec2017,1
11,"I'll preface this by letting you know that I have an appointment with a therapist next week but I needed to let this out now.

I hate myself, I have been used and walked all over for so much of my life and I hate that I am that I'm the kind of person who puts others before himself because I would want them to do the same for me. Yet no one ever has and I don't think anyone ever will. My friends didn't even remember my birthday when I went to their parties and bought them gifts. I'm usually the joke or the one that gets shit on for having a different comment or thought, when its someone else its valid.

I just watched a video where a guy explained why nice guys finish last. Not the kind of nice guy that pretends to be nice and thinks he deserves something for it, but the kind that puts others before himself and it described me really well. I have been lead on by many girls I have been interested in over the years and I just get used for attention while other guys get actual respect, and much more than me. I thought being respectful and honest that I wanted to get to know these girls would at least lead to getting respect back in the same way or a respectful rejection. Yet I get lead on and treated like a joke until my dumbass finally figures out it was all just a game to use me for attention.

I've been told by two different girls I called friends that I am the kind of guy that girls go for later in life, not in their 20s because they want to have fun and I am more of the stable guy. I am also a virgin, which is more off putting the older I get and these girls have told me to never change. A lot of girls have and in that video the guy said the same thing, nice guys don't get any attention until their later 40s at the earliest and by then their life is almost over.

I just turned 23 and I feel so worthless, I have been used just as a joke and to give girls attention while I actually cared about them. I have never been in a relationship or past kissing and I am just becoming more of a freak. My friends let it slip to a girl that I was a virgin once and she was disgusted by it, she wasn't the only girl I knew who felt that way. None of the girls that I dated knew, at least I never told them and I don't think anyone else did. I am going to be the guy who gets used for attention by other girls and walked all over by everyone for the rest of his life and then some desperate woman will finally want me after she has lived her life to the fullest. 

I hate myself because I can see that happening, if not then I'm sure I will end up alone. I am the guy people come to for help or to feel better about themselves, not the guy they want around. I will never have been good enough for the girls in my past, not even good enough for their respect. I was friends with a guy who said he saw me and the last girl I dated as a great couple, after she had tortured me so much he ended up with her and now he can't even look me in the eye. But they are having the time of their lives together, something I never had with her or anyone else and never will have because I am not worth anything, I am not respectable, I am not man enough, I am not good enough like other guys. 

I will graduate from college soon and I have a job lined up, I don't care about any of it. If I could give it all up just to go back and actually had a real chance with a girl I would do it. I could always get a degree and a job, but I will never be good enough for them or young enough to get all that fun that everyone else has had. I hate myself for being this way, I wish I could just leave and live in the middle of nowhere and never have experienced anything in my life, just solitude because I am just a waste and a bother. I have been let down a lot because I cared so much about people who barely remember me. This year has been so horrible but it made me realize that nothing great will ever come out of my life.

I will graduate, work, retire, and live alone until I go. Nothing will ever make me feel happy or make me forget about my past. But I need to be happy because I have it so well, relationships don't matter, a degree and a job is all I need. Stop whining forget4, suck it up, your problems aren't real, get over it. That's what I need to do right??? 

I will always be the worthless person that people have just used to feel better about themselves, not an actual person. I have only myself to blame, I was just never good enough, I never will be and I hate myself for it.",31Dec2017,1

Why is it so damn hard!? I've had it for longer than I've ever known and over the course of the past couple of months I have seen it slip away, leaving me in the same state I was before I graduated, an emotionally broken mess. Either I cannot feel, or my heart is trying to tear itself in two. All of my friendships feel superficial, without any real depth or meaning. Some of them I feel are countering any progress I wish to make on carving myself a way to a better life - remnants, however cherished, of a past that needs to be buried for my own sake.

I'm so empty it hurts.",31Dec2017,3
16,"My 2017 began with me determined to lose weight. I had already been trying for about 6 months and I only lost a little over 5 pounds. So I told myself that I wasn't trying hard enough; I needed to work-out more and eat less. So I began to do that. But with my new plan came the loss of any social life that I had, because once I was skinny I would have the greatest social life, this would all be worth it.

So I kept telling myself, ""This will all be worth it."" I didn't know when or how. But somehow, through all my restricting and compulsive exercising, it would pay off in the end. 

My summer was the worst. I was working at a camp and while I exercised everyday by just walking about the camp, I still told myself I was eating too much and exercising too little. This is when I started to notice that my philosophy was less of a way to better myself and more of something that resulted in the loss of my whole personality. 

I wasn't the funny, excited girl that I remembered from a year ago. I was quiet and emotional. Everything affected me. So maybe I wasn't the happiest, but it would all be worth it in the end. Once I'm skinny, I will be happy. 

I continued to torture myself and restrict myself because even though I knew that it was making me unhappy, I couldn't remember any other way of life from before. 

My depression got worse and so did my eating habits. One too many spoonfuls of rice for dinner equated to starving myself in the next day. 

I was repeating a sick cycle. Eating ""too much,"" crying hysterically because I hated myself and I was angry at myself for eating too much, then promising that I will ""be better"" tomorrow. I had never been more unhappy.

With few friends to count on or shoulders to cry on, I was more alone than ever before. Maybe doing this to myself wasn't all worth it. If my physical health is so important to me, why isn't my mental health? 

Today, I have realized how much my mental health does matter, and I actually feel good about my body now. I still have a long way to go before I can feel comfortable with myself, but for the first time in my life, I feel true happiness. My 2017 was the hardest year of my life. Nonetheless, it was the best year. I overcame so much and I know that I have the ability to accomplish so much more. I cannot wait for 2018 and I am so grateful that I finally recognize the importance of genuine happiness. ",31Dec2017,3
18,"I have done a lot of things in my life that others would find challenging. I have given a presentation to a room full of 200 people. I have written thousands of pages over the course of my career, figured out how to solve some really complex problems, stood up to bullies and jerks, comforted loved ones in some of their darkest times, and sat vigil at the bedside of a dying family member. 

Now, I find myself fighting so hard to do something that other’s find easy. I have an opportunity to pursue my dream job. I have the knowledge and experience to do it. I have no doubt that I can do the job if I get it. But, the application process requires me to ask a lot of people to stick their necks out and recommend me for the position. I have always found it so hard to ask people to do things for me. I worry that they will feel like I am imposing, that they don’t remember me, or that they don’t value my skills. I worry that they don’t really like me and want to say “no” and that I have made them uncomfortable by asking. I worry that they think I can’t do the job and that they judge and pity me just for applying. I am so awkward in social settings and I experienced some significant rejections in my personal life this year. I have struggled with anxiety and depression and I am worried that the people who know about it will think that I am incompetent and will question whether my impairments will prevent me from doing the job. I know that they won’t but, because of stigma and misunderstanding others may not believe it. Mostly, I don’t want to know if people don’t like or respect me. Asking opens the door for that rejection. It forces their hand. 

So, this has been so incredibly hard. I have reached out to people, sucked it up and asked. But the slightest silence or hesitation from them convinces me that they are just humoring me or that they are just trying to find a way to reject me nicely or they think I am arrogant for trying. And the ones who have agreed and then asked me to tell them what they should say about me have given me an impossible task. It was hard asking for their support. Telling them how exactly to praise me is something I just can’t do. I wish I could. How can I be so strong when tackling other challenges but crumble in the face of making a simple request for support?",31Dec2017,3

23,"So here's the background: My BF looks at pics of other girls, and it used to really upset me. I tried to be okay with it but it was hard. I take the time to take really sexy photos for him, but he never really looks at them cause he says it sucks when he knows he can have the real thing. And honestly, I totally understand, and I've been trying to be more understanding of him looking at other girls. I mean we both watch porn and I'm fine with that, it's just the specific photos of girls that sometimes I get annoyed with. 

But honestly, I'm over that, and as weird as it sounds, I thought posting my own photos (my BF really didn't mind, even tho reddit was convinced he did, and that I was mad) would help me kinda feel like my pics were still appreciated. And honestly, at first it felt great. I'm usually not attention seeking but I wanted to feel like my pics were appreciated by at least someone!

Then it all went downhill, when I posted the title as ""Boyfriend looks at other girls who take photos like this. So here are my photos, looking for some appreciation"". Or something like that.

Boy I was ripped to shreds. Psycho girlfriend, that he should run, etc. etc. I felt the need to defend myself, which was a HUGE mistake, and really turned on me, because it just gave people more content to rip me up. It got really nasty, I was called anorexic, it was terrible. The only reason I felt the need to reply was people were being so presumptuous, thinking I was immature and all this negative stuff. But it was really meant to be light hearted, and I wanted to show that for some couples this stuff really is a non-issue. We have bigger issues to deal with, like getting through my health issues. We have amazing sex so there's no problem there either, really.

One user really ripped me a new one, and I made the huge mistake of mentioning that one of the reasons I was so readily commenting is cause I've had the flu. I made the even bigger mistake of mentioning that I was on oxies, which obviously aren't a treatment for the flu so I was called out on my bullshit (rightfully so) there. Ensue more anorexia jokes. 

In reality, I just didn't want to get to specific with what my condition was but I'm immunocompromised (and I have MS) and was hospitalized for five days for adenovirus. It hit me really hard, the doctors thought I had meningitis. It was a terrible experience for me, and a really hard time in my life. I kinda thought posting those photos would give me a little confidence boost I needed, and since my and my bf are laid back I knew it wouldn't be a big deal. I was in excruciating pain for days on end, silently sobbing in my hospital bed with my boyfriend by my side ever step of the way. I'm incredibly thankful for him. But when I got out, I was given oxies to deal with said pain. I really don't know what I'd do without them, probably lose my sanity due to the never-ending pain. It was really getting to me. I'm usually good at dealing with pain cause of my MS and all (which also flared while I was sick, so in addition to the pain the virus caused cause it swelled tons of lymph nodes in my body, I also had shooting pain all across my legs and arms)

It was really taken way too seriously, and reddit tore me apart. Call me fragile but that many people coming at me really made me lose faith in the reddit community. I'm not some bad person. I even got made fun of for defending my name, someone was like ""Oh you know she's crazy because she's a bernie babe"" And I explained how whether or not you agree with the man, he made me really passionate about getting money out of politics. It's like half of the advocacy work I do now. But defending myself clearly was the worst route, cause then I was told to calm down. A classic misogynistic move. I mean my BF and I obviously talked about it, despite many users telling me ""to grow up and talk to him about it."" Like ok. I did. Why is everyone so mad at me?

So thanks, Reddit, for ruining something that was supposed to be fun. And sorry to all those who were enjoying my pics but I had to take them down. I heard someone's spreading them, took screenshots, I don't really mind. It's just not cool how I was just torn apart. I don't care if people think I'm fragile. Maybe I am. But I learned my lesson, never get involved in reddit comments. Ever. Defending yourself only makes you look worse, even if you're telling the truth.

After a week in the hospital (filled with tons of men not taking my pain seriously which was really fun, hoping to secure a spot at the Women's March (local) to shed light on this issue) over Christmas and now this. Ah, the joys of being alive. Lucky to have my BF by my side through shit like this, just really lost faith in humanity. It just kinda hurt and I had to get this off my chest. Please don't make fun of me anymore, I probably shouldn't even post this cause I'll probably get torn up again for one thing or the other I just really feel upset and needed to write about it.

Thanks for listening.",31Dec2017,25

27,"I'm trying to figure out the best way to see the world and everyday life in dealing with people and being confident in my words/actions.

Lately I have been trying to look at everything objectively, leave my ego behind and not take anything personally. This allows me to observe and appreciate positive emotions while letting negative emotions pass and not clinging to them as belongings. Unfortunately, this can cause me to ""plateau"", where I don't really pursue anything that takes effort, such as a relationship. It's also a very difficult mindset to keep active 100% of the time (exhausting). Maybe I just need more practice, but I think this is my ""go-to"" tactic at the moment.

I've also been trying to rely simply on what feels necessary and letting my words/actions come to me naturally. The downside to this is sometimes I feel like it might cause me to be reckless or dismissive in my behavior, which I'd like to avoid.

The whole point of this is to avoid coasting through my everyday life, feeling like I'm on auto-pilot, or stressing out over egotistical things like how people think of me. I'd like to be confident in what I do and say, while enjoying life and being at peace. How do you go about your day mentally? How would you describe your everyday mentality?

35,"So, just earlier, me and my only friend, who's supposed to fly to Singapore a few days from now, just fought.

My temper got the better of me, and him being the same childish dolt that he is, I just lost my patience.

I always treat him, I know I'm an idiot for letting him talk his way into making me pay for everything, but I can't help it, I usually just give up and treat him.

I became like a brother to this fucker. I listened to his problems, he listened to mine (but mostly just those he cared enough to hear).

The two of us aren't your typical social friends. He's the good looking dude who girls crave for, although he's short. I'm the shy, average (or ugly) looking guy who's taller than him, but always gets to be behind his spotlight.

If you don't believe me, girls ask for his number even without us noticing them at first. He even had random strangers asking to take a picture with him.

Basically, he's the social freak and I'm the socially awkward loser.

He's extroverted and loves to go out, while I'm the introverted guy who likes to stay home and have fun.

He changed me. 

He got me to try a trending haircut, which changed my appearance for the better, helped me start up in the gym. (I was always too shy to ask the gym caretakers how to work-out there and stuff), taught me to spend a bit more in stuff like clothes and fashion, stuff like that.

I was once a skinny 40 kg guy, and due to him bringing me to the gym, although we didn't hang out during my transformation phase after, I gained 24 kg and gained fat and muscle over my bones. (In lbs I gained about 52).

I became more confident, spoke to others a little bit more freely, and gained attention from women.

It was all fun, but as much as I'm grateful for this, he acts too much like an asshole and I was pissed about it.

He always made fun of my weirdness, me liking YouTubers, anime, memes, stuff like that, he didn't get it.

I also make a lot of gestures and had some bad habits.

I learned to lessen this, and work on it, but sometimes he just goes to far.

Whenever I talk about something, he'd usually comment about my gestures and ignore what I say.

There are some times, where I tell him about a story, and half way through, he'll open a topic he wants to talk about and ignore what I said.

I listen to what he says and I respond to it, even though he doesn't seem ever interested in what I say.

There was even a time when he invited me to go to mcdonalds to buy Bff fries, just to realize he was paying only a small portion of it and made me pay the rest. 

We even had facial treatments and he would convince me after to pay for it.

He would bring only a small amount of money when we go somewhere, and I had to convince him I'm not paying for him, then when it comes there, I still have to treat him.

I got so angry, that I had tell him off so many times.

When I gained muscles and fat, I became even more confident about telling him off.

I never hit him, since I still considered him as a friend, but I usually walk out whatever we were in and leave him to go home alone.

I was pissed on how I sound like he's goddamn sugar daddy, because I always pay for him.

I have a hard time making friends, especially with everyone I know mostly being Christians or extroverts, I can't get along with them.

He doesn't care much about religion though, and seemed like he needed someone to hang out with.

This few months though, I stopped studying due to a lot of things I won't explain here.

...but anyways, I didn't really feel like asking my family ever about anything due to me being a sort of black sheep. (I'm still working in our family's business though)

He's about to graduate and in a few days, he's going to another country for OJT stuff.

Although he's a social freak, most of his friends from his school live far away, his other best friend has a girlfriend he's focused upon, so I'm usually the only one he hangs out with.

These last few days, we were supposed to hang out, but he's too inconsiderate.

I work about 8-10 hours in our family's shop, and he won't believe me when I tell him I work there.

For some reason, he believes I was lying to him, that I was probably just home.

Mind you, I tell him when I don't want to hang out with him. He sometimes annoys me with how he keeps trying to hang out everytime, that I even had to block him so many times.

The first time, I told him off and said to him that he should just go to our shop and see for himself.

He said he would, but he never did.

The second time it happened again, and I got pissed and told him off.

I made him go to our shop the third time so he could see I was working there.

And this last time, he made me video chat him and started shouting and repeating what I was saying in the chat.

Our employees heard this and it embarrassed me.

I told him why he wouldn't believe me even if I told him off already. He said he believed me, but he was 'just making sure'. Which basically means, he doesn't believe me.

I admit I used to lie a few years back when we were highschool to try to make others think I was cooler than I was. Back then, all I thought was 'if I told others I was a bullied, socially inept kid with no friends, they wouldn't like me'

He was my classmate back then, but we were never close.

It was college when we met again, and he even admitted to me that he only visited me back then because he had no one close to his place to hang out with.

When we hung out, I learned to trust him though and told him the truth about me.

I told him about how I was a bullied loser, who actually never had a gf before stuff like that. 

I told him about fear of rejection and the reason why I had a hard time speaking with others.

I told him about my family issues, secrets, personal problems, insecurities.

I told him the truth.

...but this guy just wouldn't believe me, he thinks I'm this wonderously spoiled kid who's mom let him laze around home even though he stopped studying.

The thing I hate more is that he doesn't get that I want to be alone most of the time, and I crave social interaction rarely.

He always thinks I just don't want to hang out with him (some of his other friends do that, they tell him excuses to not hang out with him)

He obviously doesn't believe me, but kept pushing me, telling me he was 'just making sure'.

I got sick of it and went home, and told him I might punch him.

(I kept my anger for so long. Him tricking me into treating him, him making fun of me, him not believing me and whatnot)

I sold this man some of my expensive clothes for a tenth of the price. I even just gave him some of my expensive clothes for free.

I let this man use our gym set for free, and even acted as his bellboy when I had to take care of putting and taking off weights.

I gave him money to pay of his loan he owes his other friend, and when the time came when he was supposed to pay, he told me he'll just pay me the next week. When I told him off about it, he tells me a story about how he knows someone who let his friend's late loan be paid even later because they're pals.

I hate how he always acts so annoying and childish and acts like some kid who needs attention everytime.

I hate how I was a straight man who decides to waste tons of my money for this dude who sometimes even tells me to just forget his loans.

I was sick of it.

So I lashed out on him.

I punched him on the chest, which surprised him.

He kicked back and we fought.

He ripped my shirt, shorts, shit like that and I was pissed.

I stopped immediately when I saw passerby noticing us.

It was just earlier this night when not many people were around so it wasn't a surprise no one stopped us.

I shouted at him and told him all the things I've done for him and how I was sick of it.

He kept following me, so I turned back and asked him if he was gonna say anything.

Nothing.

He said nothing and turned back home.

I was trying to act nicer to him because he was about to leave, but I couldn't help it anymore.

I just hate how I feel as if I never get the good things for being nice.

36,"Have you noticed that in the friendship group on TV shows there is always that one friend who is dopey and stupid - that's me mostly. I hate it so much. My thinking is annoyingly slower and limited. I always feel like I need time to do things others get far quicker. I feel limited in my job prospects as I just can't think on my feet. I can in some limited cases, but not reliably. I'm way more comfortable with something straightforward and concrete. The idea of a proper job, even something like a basic office job scares the crap out of me. 

What I hate most though is how its effected my life. Parents have always mocked me for it. People have always took advantage of me making me do stupid stuff for their amusement. So many times thought people were laughing with me, but nah, they were laughing at me. It also makes me a bit of cringe guy. I'm always saying these silly things and most people are polite enough to just smile or maybe air me. But, you occasionally get that one person who really makes you feel like moron. 

School is a bit of a weird story. By the time I was 14 I was acutely aware of my limitations and very insecure about it. Because of this, I used to work extremely hard in school and it paid off for a while. Despite teachers often having understandably low expectations of me I wasn't deterred and spent hours studying and studying and eventually my grades got to a decent level. The face when those teachers saw my grade going up are still some of happiest days of my life. However, by 17, I hit an intellectual wall. Despite the work, my grades began to slip and I began losing confidence in myself. I eventually gave up academia as things just got too hard. I've more or less been living off my parents for fours year and I'm deeply ashamed. I've tried getting some things started up but keep failing. Honestly, when I look ahead I just don't see things going positively for me. I can't comprehend how. I feel little trapped because of this limitation. Like, its not possible to make a decent living for myself. I feel like being stupid is one of the worse things you can be cursed with as a human being as your life is just limited in so many ways. Maybe, just maybe things would've been better for me if I was at least a bit social. Maybe that would've distracted me and I would not have thought about this too much, but I dunno. If you read this far, thanks. Every time I try to talk about this stuff with others nobody seems to care or really want to listen. I know a lot of it is just whiny boring crap, but sometimes you just need vent y'know. Thanks.",31Dec2017,3

40,"Throwaway.

So I'm a 26 year old woman. When I was 24, I was the manager of all lifeguards at a nude beach. Myself and the other lifeguards wore uniforms. The women like me wore one piece suits and whistles, while the men wore white tank tops, red trunks and whistles.

One day, I chastised this geeky college freshman lifeguard James. Someone was in the water, and he hesitated before Hannah had to dive in and save them. I said that his timidness could've cost someone their life.

He finally snapped ""I'm sick of you berating me all the time for being so timid. I quit!!!""

I said ""Really?""

He says ""Yes!!!""

I said ""Fine. Hand over your uniform then.""

He said ""E---Excuse me?""

I said ""Your uniform was given to you by management. You have to hand it over.""

He said ""B---but I don't have anything else...with me. And the lifeguard shack is 2 miles down the beach!""

I said ""That's okay. The beach is clothing-optional. You're well within the rules. Listen James. You can't leave with company property. Either you strip down and hand over your uniform, or walk back to the lifeguard shack, change, and walk all the way back here. Your choice. Of course, we all know you're too timid anyway to take option #1.""

He looked me in the eye, and he yanked off his whistle, pulled off his white tank top, revealing his slightly chubby belly, and after a shaky-handed pause, dropped his trunks, stepped out of them, and handed them to me in defiance.

There was James. His 5'7 body, lily-white from the neck down. His slightly chubby ""freshman 15"" belly in full view. His adorable little package just flapping in the afternoon sun.

To his credit, staring right up at my 5'10 frame.

As naked as the day he was born, with his hands defiantly at his sides.

After about 10 seconds, I smirked, and looked down at his exposed penis.

And that's when he realized I was holding every stitch of fabric he had on his body and...he subconsciously covered his penis with his hands.

I smiled like the cat who ate the canary. I won the staredown lol.

Then that skyclad geek turned and sheepishly walked 2 miles back to the lifeguard station, unemployed and bare-assed naked lol.

I smirked at his surprisingly cute, round, bare bubble butt jiggling in the hot sun.

I bet he was tanned by the time he made it to the station lol.",31Dec2017,0

However, while it has felt like I've lost all the fight in me for a long time, realising that with 5 and a half hours to go I made it through this year has ignited something I haven't felt for a long time; the real desire to keep on fighting and have the chance for a much better 2018",31Dec2017,0

48,"I thought I still had time to be young and selfish. All of my friends back home were single and childless. Then I moved three years ago, and I met a lot of people who were my age and married. I thought, “Oh weird! I found a strange microcosm of people who got married young.” But, now I’m approaching 28, and all of my friends are either married or in serious relationships.

And I can’t help but think, “But I’m not done yet! There’s so much I want to do as a single person!” But, it’s also starting to get lonely. And it’s definitely weird being the only single person in a group.

But at the same time, dating is so exhausting. I flip through dating apps in a moment of insecurity or loneliness, only to get bored or despondent when I start chatting with someone.

50,"Last New Year's Eve I was bawling my eyes out in a newly half empty apartment as the guy I'd been dating for 4 years, and had thought I would one day marry, had just left me. I had just decided to change my course of study and had no idea how it was going to go, and my job was barely keeping me fed. I was *miserable* and felt like i was going to just keep sliding downwards forever, nothing would ever go right. This New Year's Eve I'm sitting in a different, cuter apartment in a better location, I've got 2 jobs which together bring me double the income I had last year, I'm 7 credits away from graduating with a 3.9 GPA and things are looking very bright for me to apply to a doctoral program in my chosen field. And I had a date last week with someone really cute who shares a lot of my interests, and we're planning to go out again. A year ago I could never have imagined that my life would be so great now. If you're out there feeling miserable and hopeless right now, don't despair, things can always turn around. You never know where you'll be in a year.",31Dec2017,572
52,"Does anyone else feel like he or she is socially older than their peers? I’m a 21 year old female and I feel like the stage that most people are at right now, I’m past it. I might be feeling this way because I’m about to graduate in May and so there is the transition between college student and the professional world I’m currently going through. 

I wouldn’t say I think I act like I’m 30, but I do feel like what someone would think at least where a 25 year old “should” be. (Let’s be honest, society is subjective, so is there really a “should be” for 25?) 
Older adults tend to think I’m older than I am, being mistaken for mid 20s at 19/20. I’ve tended to date a few years older than me. Nothing that I personally find too crazy, 3-5 years max. I have tended to befriend people that are older than I am. 2-4 years older than me typically.

I still enjoy going out and having a good time, which I think has nothing to do with maturity. I would say priorities has more to do with maturity. I could be wrong, even though I feel older I definitely still have a lot to learn about life and will continue learning into old age. 

Anyone else feel this way? I think whats prompted this post has been the less than positive dating life I’ve had. Which, I know most people go through, so realistically it’s not like I’m special by any means. Thoughts?

Edit: TL;DR, I feel socially older than my peers. Dating life is eh I feel bc of it. ",31Dec2017,0

56,"I started 2017 with someone I had been with for six years. Someone who proposed to me on Valentine's Day. 

I'm ending 2017 and beginning 2018 alone. 

No boyfriend/fiance. No friends. I live downtown so I'll get to hear all the cheering and fireworks at midnight while I sit here by myself. 

I'm almost three months pregnant with twins. I've always wanted twins, but I can't even afford to take care of myself. I have no money to my name. I have all these pregnancy cravings but all I have is coffee creamer and grated parmesan. I'll probably never have the chance to have twins again, and I'm going to have to give these ones up because I can't even take care of myself let alone two babies on my own. The doctors think they might not even survive anyway because my cervix is low and open which is a sign a miscarriage might occur.

2017 has been such a shit year. 

Started the year with a miscarriage.
Two suicide attempts. 
Failed engagement. 
Probably another failed pregnancy. 
Shit broke and starving. 
Going to have to move out of my and my ex's apartment.

The doctors think I might have lupus, which I'll be getting the blood work for soon. 

My ex gave me gonorrhea. Got it fixed. He didn't. He convinced me that if he pulls out I won't get it again. Well, today the symptoms are back. I guess that's my fault for taking his word for it.

I accomplished absolutely nothing this year. 

I wish that I'd wake up tomorrow and find that it's January 1, 2017. I could redo the year knowing everything I know now. I'd make so many different decisions. 

I wouldn't have opened up the relationship when my ex suggested it. Before he proposed to me, we opened the relationship and he wanted me to get involved with our neighbor who is also his best friend.

That decision ruined everything. That's where things went wrong. 

Now I'm pregnant, alone, starving, and just completely hopeless. 

Happy New Year.",31Dec2017,5
58,"This is the second year I’m spending New Year’s Eve “alone” (my parents are sleeping and/ or watching tv in somewhere). Last year, I had two best friends (I’ll say Friend A and Friend B). Friend A was at a NYE party I was invited to, but many other people were and I can’t remember what Friend B was doing. I started my year bawling and feeling sorry for myself. 

This year, I have three friends (A, B, and Friend C). I asked Friend C if they wanted to come over for NYE and then they said sure because they had plans, but it didn’t seem like those were going to go through. Their plans to get with some guy ended up going through and they forgot to tell me until I asked a couple of hours ago. Plus, they have been blowing me off all week so I’m upset about that. I asked Friend A what they were doing and they are going to a friends house (same friend who had the party last year). The friend said I couldn’t come because their mom only wanted a few people over because the party last year got too out of control. As for Friend C, I don’t know what they are doing and, to be honest, I love them, but they are not the person I would want to spend my NYE with. 

So now, again, I am left alone, feeling sorry for myself. Feeling like I am wasting my teen years away. I just feel like NYE is a reminder for my lack of accomplishments and lack of friends. I still have a few hours till midnight so hopefully I can just fall asleep and get a good of night sleep. 

TL;DR- My 2 friends did stuff without me last NYE and I cried as the new year started. Again, they are doing stuff without me. NYE just feels like a reminder for my lack of accomplishments and lack of friends and I hate it. ",31Dec2017,2
