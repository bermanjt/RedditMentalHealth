I already dropped the kids off at the pool 5-6 hours earlier, but I started feeling something acting up again.  
I thought I could hold it in, but a little squirt came out and I could feel a slippery sensation on my butt.",02Sep2017,2
4,"My friend's brother has a recent traumatic brain injury (car accident, his fault, no money or insurance to speak of), another friend's father has a brain tumor and though it is shrinking with treatment still has all of his terrible symptoms and his partner's dad has just had a series of strokes and his grandma just passed from cancer... I was burdened with too big a dosage of empathy when I was created- my heart breaks for them. On top of that....

I was in an amazing relationship with a man. We met on an online dating thing and instantly hit it off like we'd known each other forever. His father suffered a massive heart attack in the beginning of our relationship - but I met his entire family and we all instantly clicked as well, again - like we'd known each other for years. His mom and I especially. His dad pulled through and all was well.

As things progressed I was firm with physical boundaries and remained so, and he appreciated that. As we got farther along he began talking about the future. He instigated all of these conversations that got my mind thinking about things that I never would have considered otherwise: where we'd spend this coming Christmas, how I wanted him to propose, marriage, where we would live, kids, everything. His family was thrilled, my family was thrilled... I started actually (for the first time ever) thinking I would be married by NEXT FALL. That was our plan... I mean, we had a plan!

Then, a job change happened - I had to be in charge of stuff I had no training in and to do so I had to take a certification test having NEVER taken these classes before in my life. I was freaking out and He forgot when my test was- that's just a mistake, forgivable. But then one of the dearest men in my life died suddenly and left behind one of the dearest women in my life and their three daughters. He was an important father figure to me and my man didn't ask me if I was okay, not even once. So, I just told him that it hurt and that I needed some more support right now. That my love language is ""words of encouragement"". I told him that it didn't feel like he cared much about my ""side"" of life and there were tears (because of my abundance of feelings). 
I drove to the hospital an hour away a bunch of times when his dad was sick. I sat with him in silence and delivered things he needed. I did everything I could to support him during that terrifying time, and in my personal time of stress and grief I was alone. He said my requests felt like an attack. And without warning a couple of weeks later, he broke things off. 

So here I am, in a new job far away from my friends, working with stuff I know nothing about, angry with God for taking a man who changed my life away from his wife and children and (selfishly) me, and 100% confused and angry as to why the man who started all of these plans in my heart suddenly changed his mind. His mom doesn't even know what happened; she told me that their whole family wants answers (which makes it hurt more).

In past relationships I was sad when it was over and heartbroken occasionally, but I KNEW it was over, you know? With this one... every time my phone rings- I think it is him calling to talk. Or every time my dog barks and wags her tail at the front window it is him coming to talk to me. I am a wreck. I can put on an okay face, but I am really struggling. And I'm angry with God.
I know time is the only thing that can fix things, but man... I just don't know what to do. Everyone in my life is hurting. Especially me.

16,"I'm completely taken with my friend. She and I have been friends for years, but recently we've been spending a lot more time together. I've been single for 3 years, since my last LTR ended. It was particularly painful for me. It lasted several years, ended abruptly, and I had a ring for her. Suffice to say that I've been in some of the darkest depression of my life for a long time.

Alice (not her real name) and I have been friends since college. We ran with the same crowd. We haven't been particularly close before, but we were far more than a acquaintances. When she and her boyfriend broke up almost a year ago, we shared this terrible pain of losing significant others. No one else in our group has dealt with that. We started hanging out by ourselves a lot. Having fun shopping at thrift stores, getting dinner, and other things. We shared a lot of feelings. The kind of feelings that are heavy, existential thoughts, that no one can really discuss without just anybody. I didn't start having feelings then, but it was very meaningful to me.

Then after some more time, she started doing a lot to help me. When I lost my job, she took me to dinner. I moved almost an hour from her, but she came anyway. I lost my car, and she helped me get back on my feet. She even through me a slumber party once, when I admitted that since the break up I've become afraid of sleeping alone. She did these things and so much more for me. This was when I finally started to feel those intense, confusing feelings again, that we call attraction. I didn't like her because of the things she did, it was her character that softened my heart. Alice was the kind of person that I aspire to be. When you throw in all the things we had in common, her inner and outer beauty, and the close friendship we had developed, and I was a goner.

Today, we had to say goodbye. I'm moving to get my life on track. I'm moving back in with my mom, and apply to grad school. It's very hard to leave my friends, because I care so much for them, but it's time to make a change. I will miss Alice the most, and the thought of being away from her may be why my feelings for her have only become progressively stronger. I gave her a small present, an art piece of a rainbow colored bird that I got a long time ago at a thrift store. I knew she would love it. We shared a tender and warm embrace. We said that we loved each other, and then I think she tried to kiss my cheek, but I thought she was leaning back in for a hug, and my face collided gently with hers. She had kissed me once already, last weekend when we spent the who day together. It felt so warm and magical that day, to feel her lips against my cheek, and it only made me want to kiss her lips even more. 

We've never done anything like that before. I don't know of any other platonic guy friends that she kisses on the cheek. Alice has made comments since I shaved that I looked ""so handsome"", but I have always thought she was just being polite. I told her that I want to write her, and keep in regular contact, and she said that she would like that. She even said that she would like to come up and see me sometime. 

It feels so much like our relationship is becoming something more than a friendship, but I can't be sure. I have learned to doubt my assumptions, and for good reason. Last weekend I also found out that her ex is moving here to try and make it work out. She isn't guaranteeing a relationship with him,  but she has told me that she still cares for him deeply. I think she wants it to work. Alice also said that she didn't know what she was doing, that she wasn't sure that any of the problems that were there before were any different. It was all very upsetting to me. I didn't want her to get hurt again, and it felt like she was heading for a bad decision. I wanted to believe she felt the same way for me that I did for her. But secretly I always knew that she didn't really like me in that way anyway. I knew that I would have to get over these feelings eventually anyway. But I'm just not there yet, and I don't know if it's going to happen anytime soon.

I'm just going to enjoy this feeling for a little while. I thought I would never feel something for another person as long as I lived. Now I know that I can. Even if it's not going to work out with her, I know that my heart isn't dead. I will meet someone else. And maybe when I get over these feelings for her, I'll meet someone else. I can wait a little longer for that, now.

That's probably not the ending to this post you thought you'd get. But I don't think it's necessarily a sad one.",02Sep2017,5

20,"In the past two weeks, I have had three very specific dreams about lethal injection.

The first dream was of my brother (who, IRL, is in a bit of trouble with the authorities). He was strapped to a table in a fancy hotel ballroom, and there was a crowd of people around him, my mom and dad included. Someone unceremoniously injected him with the stuff, and the crowd started cheering and counting down as he took his last breaths. My parents did nothing to save him. I saw him die. His eyes rolled back and he stopped breathing. Right as he passed away, he smiled at me and reached out for a fist bump. I woke up, and was sick to my stomach about it the rest of the day.

The second dream was last night, and this time, it was my grandmother (who actually passed away nearly 9 years ago) and my dad. They were in the school where I work, and my aunt (dad's sister) was there with them. Both of them had IVs which were hooked up to a cell phone (the cell phone was powering the injection). My aunt was in charge of this. This dream was more like euthanasia; my grandmother was ready to die, and my dad wanted to go with her. In the dream, I was sobbing and begging them not to do it, and my grandmother said, ""There I go, I've loved you for no reason at all,"" implying that by loving me and cutting her own life short, she had wasted my time and made it more painful for me. My boyfriend woke me up before they died, because I guess I was sobbing IRL too.

The last dream was right after this dream, after I went back to sleep. This time, it was my mother and me. We were in what I'm guessing was a clinic or a nursing home. (My mom only turned 61 this year, and she's very able-bodied and sound of mind, so no hospice IRL.) She and I were sitting at this table, and a woman named Nurse Joyweather came in. She was a real bitch, not very warm or friendly, and she put an IV in both of our arms, left and right. The IV on my left didn't have a very good blood flow, and started leaking, so I walked out of the room to find her again, and tell her there was something wrong with my IV. She told me not to worry about it because ""It'll be over soon."" I woke up, totally confused.

What the hell are these dreams about? They are very disturbing, and it's extremely unusual for me to have the same type of dream over and over like this (haven't had recurring nightmares in about 16 years). IRL, my brother is on probation for two drug felonies that will be expunged if he completes some classes, and I rarely see him. My dad and I work at the same school, but I never see him, because he's with the younger kids, and I'm with the older kids. I haven't thought about my grandmother in ages. My mom just got back from a trip to her hometown, and she's been sick with the norovirus, but is almost fully recovered. I have been slightly more stressed since the school year began, and if you look in my post history, [I've had some recent issues with sleeptalking too](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6vxrja/boyfriend_says_ive_been_sleeptalking_about/), but lethal injection dreams seem really over the top for my amount of stress.

24,"I'm a college student who stayed home over the summer. I was in a weird situation where I'm taking a summer class and I'm between leases in my houses. So I ask a friend if I can store my things in his garage and pass out on his couch, and he agrees and says I won't have to worry about paying rent or anything. While I was there he has a roommate living there too, and we all get along over the 2 week course of me sleeping on their couch. 

When the summer class was over, my friend left to go back home and I left to go back to my hometown a day after he left. The only person left at the house was his roommate who was there 3 more days before he went to his hometown.

Weeks later I return before anybody else came back, so I can move all my things out of their garage and into my new house and get settled in before the fall semester starts. At first glance I noticed there were some things missing like my Emmitt Smith jersey my grandfather gave me before he died. At first I thought I misplaced it, but after seeing a completely empty garage I knew it had been stolen. 

2 more weeks pass by, and I'm getting ready for the first tailgate/game day of the school year. I go into my closet to look for my favorite game day polo, and I noticed that was not with all my other favorite shirts. Then I start remembering everything I had and started going through all my clothes to find out I have close to 10 shirts missing including all of my game day polos. So now here I am hours before he first game and I have nothing to wear tailgating and with there being dress codes for the tailgates I cannot attend them because I have no money to purchase any new shirts or clothes.

I talk to my friend and his other roommate (this roommate wasn't at the house all summer) and they both separately hinted that I should talk to the roommate who was there an extra couple days before I left. So I did and he denied it, and has pretty much been avoiding me everytime I've gone over since to hangout with my friends there. 

I'm almost 95% certain he stole my shirts, but was pisses me off is I thought we were all friends. Before splitting up they said they enjoyed having me over because I make things less boring and give them something to do other than sit around and play video games. 

Just looking for some advice on how I should confront this situation. And no I'm not going to bust in seal team 6 style and raid the place looking for my things. I'm not upset for losing shirts since they're only material things (other the E. Smith one because it has sentimental value) but rather that a so called friend would raid my closet and steal all my favorite shirts.",02Sep2017,3
25,"I would love to hear your suggestions. Some of my thoughts are below. Most of them are from reading online and may not be ""FEMA approved.""

Before something damages infrastructure, fill all your glasses with water and then put them back in cabinets. Fill your bathtub for cleansing or emergency drinking. Your water heater is a big storage tank with an outlet at the bottom that can be used.

Hypothermia can happen at surprisingly warm temperatures and water makes you lose heat much faster. Tucking into a ball with your knees up and arms against your sides helps retain heat, as does clothing to an extent.

Flood water is very unclean and should be avoided, especially exposure to broken skin.

Shut off power at the circuit breaker if flooding is significant in your home.

Remember you have a phone charger in your car that doesn't need city electricity to charge.

Wet drywall should be pulled out as soon as possible in order to prevent increasing mold damage.

30,"Reflecting on the cop who arrested the nurse, I have long thought the bar for becoming a police officer is set to low.

Teachers must have fit year degrees and then have a limited time to earn a graduate degree. It's time we require some basic law courses for police officers.

People in classes with me always turn to me for answers and advice. I don't know why- it's clear I'm always on the verge of failing my classes. Why do they always pick me to come to for advice?

I can barely do a normal day's work without an anxiety attack coming on, and yet for some reason people always seem to feel like I'm one of the best ones for doing whatever job needs be done and I hate it.

I want to be good, but despite what they all seem to think, I'm really, really not.

I don't understand why their expectations are as high as they are. They're all wrong.",02Sep2017,2
36,"

My brother is 25 years old. He was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and then the leukemia was discovered. Because of his kidney disease he can no longer process any of the radiation and chemotherapy is too dangerous. His doctors told him a few days ago that even with better diet and exercise that he only he has a year left. My brother has decided not to do any treatment, not even methadone, and just live out his time. 


I should mention that my brother is female to male transgender, and apparently the hormones are the main thing that damaged his kidneys. He doesn't want to stop taking them because all he's ever wanted to be is comfortable and in the right body.


All while this is happening, his wife is wanting a divorce from him. He calls me almost everyday completely distraught about his wife leaving and it seems that he almost doesn't care about his illness and taking care of himself. Honestly I'm afraid of what he'd do, he's also bipolar and sometimes shows signs of suicidal tendencies.


He lives in Nevada which is quite far from me, however we're still very close. Our family only consists of me, my brother, and our mother. Our mom is going through a tough time as well; living in a trailer, no car, and sometimes I'll wire her money for food. Everything has taken such a toll on my brother physically that he's even having trouble working because he's too weak. I seem to be the only one in his support group that's doing okay for myself, and because of this I feel that I should take responsibility for them but I have no idea what to do or where I could possibly start. 


I thought his wife would help support him through sickness and in health but she says that she can't handle it. And to an extent I understand why she thinks that, but he's heartbroken and that's a void that I can't fill. I want to go visit him however, while I'm the most well off in my family I can't really drop money for an airline ticket for both me and my mother. 


So what I'm asking is are there any resources out there for terminally ill patients like him? What can I do for him to make the rest of his life easier? 



**tl;dr**
Brother has leukemia and a year left to live, his wife is also divorcing him now, what can I do as his little sister to help him? Are there any resources for people in his condition? ",02Sep2017,2
37,"I lost my mother this year, ended a job i like, postponed my education, stopped going to the gym, zero hobbies or sports, nor relationships.

It started about a month ago, Tho I'm not depressed (i think?) but recently whenever i do something, the thought of it being pointless or insignificant pops in my head and I can't disagree with it. I do things half-assed, and have no motivation for anything. 

The only person I know who can fix me is myself so i am posting this for advice and criticism. Thanks",02Sep2017,2
38,"Hey asshole, hide all you want but I know you know how this ends.  I’ve been listening to your music and you truly are the dumbest of dumb, you don’t call the plays in public jackass.  Everything I have said you have already said, so what does that tell you? Well, number one I am not impressed, I know you sent those killers for me and you are such a stupid person you didn’t understand, the Lord is with me, you chose the side of the deceiver and he has abandoned you. But I know I can’t tell you nothing, well listen here you do your dirty work yourself, I’m here in Austin and you don’t have any power, God is the power and he told me to wreck you if I see you.  Yeah, I saw you in the video holding that head, well you are a monster but I am legion, you have to fight me yourself so come. If you doubt, create a piece of original music and release a single right now, everything you have you will lose because the kids are waking up.  They are going to make beautiful new music and art and do wonderful things you can't do and no one will want to hear your corny shit anymore. You're out and good riddance.


I know what happened, and this is why you are so stupid, he came to you when you were supposed to die didn’t he?  You were supposed to die from that car accident weren’t you, umm hmmm.  You claim you’re a rapper but you didn’t have enough sense to listen to Snoop Dogg’s Murder Was The Case so you a) have no real respect for your art and b) therefore didn’t know the play.  You wanted to be famous, you wanted to be the star- you so jealous of all these true musicians you have made a whole career of aping others hit songs and filling these real artists with doubt.  What did he promise you? He promise you forever, you dumb fuck haven’t you noticed you’re getting old? You are a real true blue sell out.  I am not going to say your name because you will not be remembered. 

 Let me tell you something, people remember Hitler because he was called by God, Jews you should really take this lesson to heart because it’s an old one.  Here’s the rub, I lived in a Hasidic Jewish neighborhood, Boro Park, I do love your style and so I am not anti-jew but you are too damn hardheaded, there are no more second chances wise up or you’re out. You see all your profiteering and meddling in our institutions has corrupted us to the point where the devil is here.  It is through your influence, our artists suffered, our law is incongruent, our greed is rampant and our heart cold. The lesson, all humans is we are not smart. Get this message loud and clear because it is the most important thing written here, we are not clever like we think we are. Ole jackass, constantly rapping about Jesus and forgot that only Jesus saves.  We always think we’re so clever, animals are smarter than us.  An animal lives their life by instinct, by the will of God.  We don’t.  Whatever we have, however we are, we always want what someone else has and is.  Stop it. We exist by the extension of God’s mercy and love.  All of our supposed ingenuity and genius comes from God, we are dumb fucks.  We remove killer whales from the ocean and put them in a tank for our enjoyment despite the fact that is not their purpose. The killer whale knows it’s supposed to be in the ocean and suffers and dies and we worry about the profit we’re missing out on.  That’s why so many species on this planet is near and going extinct, they have lost confidence in us and are not as selfish and cruel as us humans to condemn their offspring to lives of misery.  Have you ever noticed humans, that the countries that are the worst off have the highest birth rates?  Those countries suffer not because they aren’t smart or deserve it, they suffer because of the selfishness of the citizens.  I learned this lesson from this boss I had from the Ivory Coast juxtaposed to janitorial staff and garage workers from El Salvador at my old job.  Africans pay attention to this lesson, because I was not on your side until I went to an African church recently and saw that you are good.  Okay, so these various people immigrant to America, what does my boss do, he hates everyone without status or tries to exploit everyone around him for his own selfishness. He is the stupidest man in the place but demands everyone crown him king.  He’s married to a woman he doesn’t love and leaves his only child in his home country because he’s afraid she will become “Americanized.”  All the while he attacks various people:  the young, women and the inattentive making everyone around him miserable because he knows Americans give second chances and are forgiving.  When he goes home he shows off pictures of his cars, and his motorcycles and helps no one.  He’s playing us. He is not the same as these good men from Salvador.  These good men and women, live with their families and protect and care for their homes here as well as the ones they were forced to leave behind.  They are committed to service, volunteering to help others learn English and so forth.  They do not covet as my boss did. When I speak with them, I feel good and they build community amongst us.  There are those in the immigrant community trying to destroy us but you know them by the extension of their own culture, if they do not wish to create expat communities it is because they know they are no good.  If you as a native born American cannot eat a meal at their house and celebrate with their family or they are not sick with worry to help those they leave behind they are not human.  They are like jackass, pretenders.  You cannot ape being human, you either are or you aren’t. You cannot inherit the birth right of humanity; you will be culled and cast out. 


This is it, you should understand we stand now because everything we need to succeed already exists.  Everything has purpose, God knows all and we are playing catch up.  There’s a reason even why our generations have their names, The Greatest Generation is great because they were in full compliance of God’s will, the Silent Generation is named so because they chose to not listen, Baby Boomers neglected their children and their responsibilities even though they didn’t get it all wrong  they did kill their judge; Gen X, we were meant to come at the end but hopefully we will not be the end, we must use all our latchkey kid solutions to fix this mess despite not knowing how it is supposed to go (once again, the solutions will have to be new- no more marching etc, the devil will not be defeated in such a manner) and millennials you’re in charge of the new world order. The Lost Generation is truly lost. 


God is on our side but he is not human. I know what I know now because Kurt Cobain martyred himself. That's how I know it’s you, dumbass because you can’t keep your mouth shut because of your vanity. You dare call yourself a rock star, a god, Kurt Cobain was the realest rock star there ever was and he didn’t even want to be one.  Actually, I understood this from being a Faith No More fan.  Check this out, so I love Faith No More, but I don’t have the slightest idea what the hell Mike Patton is singing about, not the slightest clue- doesn’t actually matter to me, I'm in love with their music but what the hell are you talking about Mike Patton?  However, I understand every single thing Chuck Moseley says, love all of Faith No More’s music right. Okay, so here’s the thing, I realized, first, I don’t understand any god damn lyric of any of Nirvana’s music but I have loved Nirvana since I was twelve. Why, because Kurt Cobain was under the influence of divine inspiration, actually God was speaking to Kurt Cobain so much He drove him crazy.  God spoke to me one time and it felt like having my brains blown out with a shotgun and I asked God to not speak to me so ever again because I feared I would go crazy.  Hitler shot himself not because he thought he was going to lose but because he had enough humanity to feel shame for what he had done.  We’re coming full circle. Now, why do we all think we know what Nirvana songs are about despite not writing a single lyric, journalism.  Now, I come full circle. I was supposed to be a politician, I wanted to fuck Bob Dole when I was in the seventh grade and was a diehard Republican to boot.  So why do I suddenly find myself in journalism school in college and a mindless democrat? God. See where I am going with this, if your faith in God is true you do what you’re told even when it doesn’t make you especially happy.  Most journalist are really not smart people.  I found this love letter one time from this journalist I had a lot of respect for and she could barely write.  Journalist as a group is made up mostly of people who really can’t do anything but watch what everyone else is doing and provide bland commentary. Journalist write stories in their head before they even see what is actually going on and worst there is an attitude of indifference and moral superiority most really don’t deserve.  It is important to report what is happening in the human condition but you are perverting your purpose by all your patting yourself on the back and pretentiousness. Journalists, calling themselves, paparazzi, and now sitting on t.v. and calling themselves reporters when they are really unentertaining apes destroying the natural boundaries between artists and their fans.  Scaring people so they no longer are willing to risk their calling because they’re not perfectly beautiful (look here when you are doing something you truly love you are the most beautiful thing in the world), or rightfully afraid of criticism and yet all the time propping up these fool celebrities who degrade our respect for true art. Respect artists, protect them, there is no reason you need to be all up in these people’s business.  God makes you extremely fragile and these people are very delicate, often not good at taking care of themselves.  All Kurt Cobain wanted was to be loved by his family not devoured by the greedy, the jealous and the cold. Heed, these people called are important-these “journalists” who the hell knows.  Many are not people of humanity, I remember I was in this e-mail group called PJAfterSchool and this guy who I had a lot of respect for and thought was so moral and good sent this e-mail where he said he’s either covering or presenting as a hypothetical a child starving to death in front of his eyes and whether it was appropriate to feed this child or if doing so would compromise his journalistic integrity and I remember thinking, clearly this motherfucker has never been starving, not hungry, starving a day in his life because he would never then write some shit like that and send it to people for their opinion. I have suffered, I have starved and I know when you see another person in need you help that person, you do not need to ask anybody else a thing because you are behaving as a human, you are being HUMANE.  Therefore, don’t think so much.  Feel, experience, talk, walk, fuck and live!

Lastly, President Donald Trump is in full service of God. It took me a minute to understand this, but, that’s why ole golden football head went running to Trump upon his election, to try to deflect because you knew I was called you shit, well the jig is up.  Check this, so what is the deal with President Donald Trump, well just like Saul he’s a case of you get what you ask for.  You want the President to be a spokesman in your ideal image you got the very best spokesman in the land.  President Donald Trump is giving you everything you ever ask for.  You want a strongman, white man, running around scaring immigrants and talking hard, well, first, Americans we are not more important than these other countries ok once and for all. We are chosen but not special so get over that. That’s why these other countries aren't running in fear and all falling over themselves from laughing and are in secret craving our asses up.  White Americans, I love you but grow the fuck up once and for all, you don’t get another twenty years for this, you are not special.  Being able to kill someone does not make you special, God can kill you all right now and then what, big deal.  Look even though I am personally not that hot on Islam, I have to honor an Islamic man who helped me with a dollar when I very much needed it and I promised him I would remember what he did and so I have to amend my previous feelings about Islam and mention that A) religion is man-made, but, there is only one God, really Buddhist, Catholic, Christian denominations whoever, Jr.’s Chicken Shack is all in line with God and you can tell by the extension of man's intrepretation~ religion, effect on these various nations. If a country claims it is of faith but its people suffer greatly that religion is out.  Oh so Scientology is definitely out, sorry Tom Cruise, I love Tropic Thunder but you gotta make a decision because it’s on.  And Leah Remini is a true soldier of God, she is speaking the truth so I would abandon Scientology with the quickness because everything is about to come to a head.   Mormons, you’re doing better but you’re under review. Islam, clearly you are under review. Let me just say this plain, if your faith is bad you will fall. Atheist, sorry you’re out.  Agnostic, um what is that? B) Stop worrying about Jesus Christ’s race, it’s immaterial just be happy he was real and came.  C) Jewish men and women of faith, please, get it right this time and correct yourselves for good or we’re all out.
Okay, so President Donald John Trump, here’s the deal with that, we broke it and we have to fix it. We all, including President Trump know he doesn’t know what he’s doing but he wanted to win and we elected him (ssshhh wait).  This is the ultimate test of our institution, what makes us Americans is not the title of the job we have, the money we have in the bank, our flash or style it’s our ability to learn and our ability to adapt.  President Trump needs help, we cannot impeach him, we will destroy the validity of our democracy.  We will destroy ourselves.  We will be eaten alive by the wolves at our gate and we will fall. President Trump stop being so selfish, admit you are out of depth and allow everyone to help you.  There are no kings in America for a reason. This is your test, you must put aside your pride and fear and let others in and let others help you. We must all work together, NOT for you.  If you want to be adored, you shouldn’t have run for public office that’s what you got wrong about Ronald Reagan.  I hated Ronald Reagan, he was my first president and Make America Great Again was his slogan, stop aping him.  Reagan was out of his depth but he had George H.W. Bush in his corner and was smart enough to know despite despising Bush Sr. to listen to him. It was far from perfect but he was called for his time and he answered.  You were deceived. So President Trump you better tell the devil to kiss your ass or you can join jackass.  Times up, it’s now or never. The dinner bell has been rung.

39,"No, I'm not making a joke about a Nigerian Prince Email. This is real dollars (proof below).

One hundred trillion dollars is a *whole lot of money!* More than I can even imagine, or spend in a lifetime, probably. If this was in U.S. Dollars, how might we use it to make the world a better place, especially for /r/self subscribers?

Maybe we could buy the internet (I don't know - all the IPs and servers and stuff?) and make super high speed access available free for everybody? I'm not sure how that would work though.

Or perhaps we could put it towards space travel and finally colonize Mars before anybody else stakes their claim there? We can change the name to Pirate Planet or something like that!

First thing though, I think I'm going to buy Steve Jobs' big white yacht to get around in. Unless you guys have a better suggestion. Then the rest can be used for whatever we decide.

Give me some ideas and I'll see what I can do.
