1,"I just gotta get this off my chest. I don't know if this is the right place. But I need somewhere to write it. Even though I'm a conservative, I believe all of these industries have significant problems that cause a Ton of undue suffering to ordinary citizens. 

I'll start with universities. For the record, the exact reason schools are so expensive now is because banks can make risk free loans that are guaranteed by the federal government. It is also impossible for students to bankrupt this debt. So they're stuck with it until it's paid off.  This leaves universities with the ability to charge whatever they want, because banks will issue the loans because they don't have to shoulder any risk. Because of this prices increase for the sake of increasing and universities aren't required to compete with each other. By having the system set up this way, it directly removes capitalism from the equation because there's no incentives for universities to actually better themselves or compete with other universities for students. So prices will just go up, up, up and everyone is happy. The universities, the bankers, and the politicians who get their campaign money from the bankers. Meanwhile our youth are having their net worth literally stolen from them for decades after college. Assuming they even finish in the first place.

This will be one of the reasons shit hits the fan. I guarantee it.

The issue with healthcare, is the way prices are decided. Insurance companies negotiate actual prices between hospitals and doctors. Because of this hospitals always jack up their prices in an attempt to negotiate to a much better position and make as much money as possible. The problem here though, is the prices don't differ between insurance companies and individuals. So an individual without insurance will receive the same bill as the insurance company, but lack the ability or skill set to negotiate it down to a more fair level like the insurance companies do. And once again, because of our shitty corrupt governments, they've completely removed capitalism from the equation by restricting insurance companies to states. They aren't allowed to sell across state lines. This again stifles competition and other market forces, which continues to insure that prices remain high and healthcare continues to be one of the most profitable industries in the whole country. Honestly health insurance has become one big joke. The only thing health insurance companies should offer are catastrophic plans to cover individuals in case of lengthy hospital stays or life saving procedures. Otherwise I contend doctors should deal directly with patients for everything else. That way hospitals are forced to compete on price and quality. This will drive prices down to a normal and fair level. But because we live in an apparent oligarchy, the chances of that happening are bar none.

In the meantime, healthcare related debt continues to be the number one cause of bankruptcy in the United States.

As for private prisons, while not nearly as big a problem as some would have you believe, there are still issues with the ones that do operate across the country. The problem with Prisons, is the companies that run our private prisons locked the government into contracts to meet quotas and keep beds full. So even if an offender is no threat to society, the government has an obligation to meet that quota. Therefore people get locked up rather than using other proven more effective rehabilitative programs. And because there's a profit motive for these prisons, they issue 300% more citations to inmates than normal publicly funded prisons. Those citations insure people stay locked up. The focus is on profit. Not rehabilitation. Furthermore, these private prisons use these prisoners as cheap slave labor. Sometimes paying pennies for an hour of work. This again is immoral. And the only reason that this is allowed in the first place is because of the prison lobby. So politicians remain happy and get campaign money. The prison companies remain happy and get paid. And inmates and other citizens are again being beaten down and taken advantage of. All in the name of making an extra dollar.

As for the root of all these problems, the issue is politics. The problem with politics is money shouldn't be involved in it at all. If politicians weren't allowed to accept giant campaign contributions from corporations and other interest groups (most of who aren't required to file who their donors are), they wouldn't find themselves in the position to push though shitty policies that hurt citizens like this in the first place. But because they love power, and need money to get re-elected and stay in power, they happily accept it and therefore in return push laws and bills that directly hurt their constituents. It's why the insurance and healthcare industry get to do what they do, why banks and universities get to do what they do, and why private prisons get to do what  they do. I'm convinced reforming our campaign finance laws will fix all of these problems in due time.

And yes even though I am conservative, I also believe we spend too much on military. $600 billion a year. More than the next 18 countries combined all of who are allies. If we didn't spend so much on military, maybe we'd have the money needed to make life better for citizens here. As it is now, our allies get to skimp on military spending because Uncle Sam has their back, and redirect that money to policies and programs that directly make life better for citizens of those countries. In essence, we subsidize the exact things that make life so good in other countries. And to me that is also immoral. 

Anyway. I just wanted to write this down. Would love to have any conversation about it and hear other people's views. 

EDIT:  This post was shared with me and it explains exactly where the money for the DoD budget goes:  https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/46iaf6/ugtferinyes_explains_why_cutting_military/?st=J4ATZQD5&amp;sh=3cb96004

I really recommend reading it. I didn't mean to imply that military was the only thing we could cut. And actually reading that post you almost walk away thinking we can't cut it. But really the argument comes down to if we should maintain our current goals which require that level of spending. Also, I learned that Military spending is at it's lowest point since WWI when you account for inflation.

I definitely made a mistake by implying that military was the only thing we could cut. There's a lot of waste that we spend in Education and Healthcare. So much so they double the spending of the military. All in all, I think we definitely need to look at all of our programs and try to accomplish our goals in the most efficient and cost effective way as possible, while also cutting out waste, abuse, and overspending where possible.

2,"Hey guys ,

Not a great time at the moment . My dad has had a host of health issues last couple of years (he's type 2 diabetes; had a kidney stone cause a blockage and kidney failure which was thankfully treated well).

Shortly after that , he was told he had non alcoholic cirrhosis , not major , so cool beans we thought , and he kept in regular checks with his doctor and medical consultant too. 

The last few months (around 4-5) has seen around 3 episodes of serious delirium , shaking of hands and lethargy . we thought it was Alzheimer's or Parkinson's but the consultant said it could be caused by the liver somehow but didn't explain much else . 

I read online about cirrhosis and came across hepatic encephalopathy and it ticks all the boxes (confusion , slurred speech, shaking hands , lethargy ) . A few months passed and it seemed to subside (each episode only lasted around a day or two at most ).

Then this Monday morning he had another episode except this one lasted all week , again , pretty serious symptoms like the last time , he had to take a week off work and just when we thought he was perking up Wednesday , 3am on Friday morning he broke into another episode and we called an ambulance , they quickly rushed him to the accident and emergency . Doctors ran all manner of tests (blood sugar , liver function , ammonium levels) and they were aware of his cirrhosis too . Nothing came up , nada, liver function was fine as were the blood tests , so they just advised him to stay hydrated and that it was probably a reaction to heat from diabetes (which I'm not convinced on at all , we live in Ireland for Christ sake , we had a week there of pretty hot weather but he has been to Spain a few months ago and works in the Netherlands during the week where he says it's quite hot too with no problems )

I really am not sure what to do , I just want to know if there's anything I should be pushing for doctors to check or investigate , failing that I am willing to give my liver if that's what it takes but they haven't even suggested a transplant which is concerning Becuase it seems like a severe issue which isn't showing improvement .

I would also appreciate an honest response of the mortality of this kind of thing , just to brace myself and my family for what might be coming . Thanks guys in advance , I really appreciate anyone with any insight or help !",24Jun2017,1
3,"My second book, The Struggles of Johnny Cannon, came out on October 13, 2015.

Two weeks later, I was in the emergency room because I thought I was dying. Over the course of the next year and a half, I watched my life as it had been on October 13, 2015, slowly but steadily come crumbling down around me. And today, I'm a better man for it.

Yeah, you guessed it, I've got a story to tell.

But first, the backstory. 

I'm a man of faith. I'm a Christian, not in a ""this is how I was raised and how I vote and God and guns"" kind of way, but in a ""I've come to believe that the truth I find in the Bible, and especially in the life and teachings of Jesus, is the foundational truth on which I'll base my life"" kind of way. My faith is the core of who I am.

That's why I became a pastor. Well, that and the fact that, with a bible college degree, there's not a whole lot of other fields for which you are qualified. (Oh, yeah, did I not mention that? Yes, I went to a bible college to become a missionary at first, then a church planter, then a translator, then a musician, and eventually graduated with a ton of college credits (I'm proudest of the music and language training) and a diploma that declares I have a degree only in Bible)

Of course, I must admit that being a pastor has not ever been my dream. Writing books has always been my dream. And it was at that parenthetically mentioned bible college that I took a creative writing class in which my professor encouraged me to pursue my dream ""because dreams come from God."" And, wouldn't you know it, through her encouragement, I was able to sign with my dream literary agent, sell a book (then a couple more) to a Big 5 publisher, and see my dream of telling silly little story about an Alabama kid who takes on Castro, the Klan, and the CIA come true.

Meanwhile, in my pursuit of taking care of my family and doing the work that I trained to do, I took a position at a church as the Children's Pastor. And I must tell you, this position was a blessing-and-a-half financially, because it paid me pretty darn well. With that position and some freelance work, my wife was able to see her dream of staying home with our kids while they are still young come true. 

So there you have it. Two dreams coming true. Happily ever after, right?

Insert clever GIF here.

Yeah, so back to the breaking point two weeks after my second book came out.

I had scheduled some school visits to promote the book down in Florida, a trip that also included a Disney World vacation for me and my family. And so, there we were at Disney World, and I was pushing a stroller with my son in it, and all of a sudden, my chest decided my heart needed a great big hug. I nearly collapsed from the pain and the shortness of breath, dizzying pain that sent sparks through my eyes and made my brain feel like it was going to pop.

I was sure I was having a heart attack.

My wife got me into an emergency room as soon as possible and that's when we got news we weren't expecting.

I'd had a panic attack. In the happiest place on earth.

I'd never had a panic attack before, and I'm not afraid of large crowds, nor do I have any real phobias that create any kind of debilitating reaction in me, so this was completely unexpected.

As the doctor tried to help me sort through everything, she asked a good question. ""What's your stress level?""

I just started laughing. ""Let's see, a brand new book, an incredibly demanding job, a family of five that depends on my income? Yeah, I'm stressed.""

She recommended therapy (which I began) and that I eliminate stress. Another doctor gave me some pills with the caveat that ""this may hurt your creativity for a little while until you balance out."" 

Within a week of starting the pills, I couldn't write. Like, at all. Not even a limerick. Of all the stressful thing in my life, writing was not what I'd hoped to eliminate.

Two months later, we found out my wife was pregnant. My chest began to tighten again. But I was happy beyond measure. I'd always wanted a big family, and four kids just seemed right for us.

But then, two months after that, we lost the baby in a miscarriage.

And so my writing was gone. My hope for another baby was gone. Thankfully I still had friends (though I didn't tell a lot of people about all that was happening, because I was raised in Texas and anything beyond ""hello"" is over-sharing), still had my church family, and still had a job that paid well enough to keep us in our Philadelphia apartment and pay our bills. Even though my dreams were gone, at least my life wasn't in shambles.

A couple months later, my wife and I went on an anniversary trip to Miami, where we also celebrated my birthday, and I decided to stop looking at what I'd lost and instead focus on a new beginning. I had one more book coming out in 2016, and after that, if I never wrote again, I'd had a good run. Maybe Pastor Isaiah was who I'd be for the rest of my life and Author Isaiah would be a fun memory to tell the grandkids.

The day after my birthday, I walked into my office at the church and started reading my birthday card. I was immediately called into the executive pastor's office for a meeting.

My employment was terminated, effective immediately. I needed to clear out my desk and be gone ASAP. No, there was no moral failure. No, I hadn't done anything wrong. I just wasn't the right person for the job, and so I was no longer employed.

Pastor Isaiah died on June 2, 2016. And, with one quick meeting, my family was without income. My wife and I drove home, stunned, realizing that we couldn't afford to live in our apartment anymore. We contacted our landlord and a friend and agreed to move out within a couple of weeks. All of our things to storage. Our bodies to live with friends and family.

Homelessness is an odd state to be in, particularly when you have a book release coming in a few months and you're still going to schools and bookstores to promote your last one.

Promoting books is an odd thing to do when you no longer have the ability to write creatively. Even more odd when you know that you've already gotten and spent your advance money to keep your family afloat and, most likely, you'll never see another cent of profit from these books you're pushing into the hands of happy little readers.

Yeah, this story sucks. I'm sorry. But, thankfully, it gets better.

I tried to force my creative spirit to return over the next few months, but it didn't play nice with me, partially because those pills never did level things out. Finally, with advisement, I weaned off of them, but the creativity was slow in returning. I was desperate to sell something, anything, to get an income, so I peppered my agent with idea after idea, most of them terrible and hackneyed. She was patient with me. I was impatient with myself. Patience and homelessness don't work well together, especially when you've got a family.

We were homeless through Christmas. We spent the holidays in my brother's house.

Some time around then, my wife got pregnant again. (Apologies to my brother, I promise we washed the sheets) But this pregnancy was complicated and difficult. We had to spend time in the ER from the very beginning. Finally, we found a specialist in western PA who could help my wife best. In March, through some miracles that go beyond explanation but I attribute to the blessing of God, we were able to rent a house and moved our family closer to the doctor. I got a job substitute teaching and a second job working in a restaurant. Somehow, we started making it again.

And, somehow, I started to find myself again. I started doing cognitive behavioral therapy (which I'd forgone in favor of pills before). I started reading for fulfillment and self-growth. I started journaling. Oh, and praying. That became a vital part of my daily routine again too.

And then, like a dying ember that finds fresh kindling, my creativity began to come back to life. I started writing again. Short stories, then longer stories. And now the first draft a novel is being born on my desk, a book about spies and adventure and heroism and an all-girl-school and finding life anew.

And, in just a couple months, my second son will be born.

We're still impoverished (literally). We're still struggling. My income right now is less than $2,000 a month. We still have to pray that God will provide for our bills and our food and any emergencies that might pop up.

But I'm nowhere near as stressed today as I was in 2015. Because I have the two most valuable invisible currencies in abundance.

Dreams and Faith.

This is the first time I'm sharing the fullness of this story publicly, but I'm doing it for a reason. I'm doing it so that, as God provides for my family, He will get all the glory and credit for doing what only He can. Taking a boy like me and doing something amazing for me and through me, for the world.

I didn't write this post to solicit help, but rather to be honest with you about my life. I want everyone out there to see that, even in this difficult time, the positive messages I spread on twitter and facebook are genuine and I believe them. I believe in God's love, I believe that we can all make a difference, I believe in the power of art and stories to change the world, and I believe you and I can be heroes if we just try. Whether or not the church I'd worked for was right in terminating my employment is no reflection on my faith in God or in the Church, because I'm still passionate in my faith and in my love for the community of Christ.

And in that, I have more than enough to be happy.",24Jun2017,2
4,"I'm almost 29 years old. But I don't feel I'm... Any more an adult when than when I was 17. Like, don't get me wrong. I've certainly matured as far as being a happily married, self sustaining adult. I'm mostly debt free, except for student loans from my wife and a car that has $3000 left to pay. I've held a job since I was 18. But when I look at my friends, they just seem so much more....adulty. I'm kind of high so I may be expressing myself poorly. But they're adults in the way I think of my parents. They have more adult interests. They speak in a more professional manner. I still talk like I'm 18. They dress like adults. I just still feel the same internally as I did when I was a teenager. Am I just crazy?",24Jun2017,6
5,"I used to drive, until I moved to the city. I sold my car because I couldn't be bothered to pay for parking, let alone insurance or gas on my own. So I bought a moped; an old Huffy cruiser with an 80cc motor on it. It was a fixer upper, which I didn't know at the time, and I couldn't be bothered to keep it up, what with the fuel mix being very tricky and the chain breaking off midride. But even though I can't be bothered most of the time to put in the effort of motorized vehicles, Gods do I just miss things powered by bloody explosions!

I feel like I'm appreciated at home and I feel like pretty soon I'll be appreciated in my community. I've always wanted to do something like this I just didn't know how. As it turns out, it's incredibly easy to become a volunteer ff, at least in my county. Kind of kicking myself for wasting so much time but mostly I'm just really happy. A year ago I'd never think this would be my life. I'm proud of what I've accomplished. I can't wait to see what will evolve from this.",24Jun2017,5

14,"I walked on to my college baseball team and I'm largely ignored by the entire coaching staff. My teammates all seem like good guys and they all really seem to enjoy my company and give me some positive comments, but in reality I'm leagues behind them and I think they're too afraid to tell me that I'm not cut out to play the best sport in the whole wide world. If someone could just confirm that with me, I could stop wasting my time with something that won't ever work out and utilize that time to actually work towards a viable future. But in the meantime, I'm still playing and hoping that I'm wrong about myself.







I think I have a slightly lazy eye but nobody has ever been brave enough to confirm that with me.







My ""best friends"" feel like they only talk to me because they feel bad for me. *But why?*





Most women I meet treat me like a little kid, almost like a little brother (I mean, I'm small, a twig, and I do have a young face). I actually really like a lot of them and would do anything for them to treat me seriously and let them see that my kind words and gestures are genuine and driven by my actual affection/care for them, but almost none of them see that.






There's one person in particular who stands out above the rest. We've been friends for five or six years now and within the last eight months or so, we've become incredibly close. All I want to do every day is make her the happiest person in the world, making sure that her time here is spent in the best way possible. The only thing I want in return is to have that chance. I don't want her to return my affection, I just want her to know that life doesn't have to be sad or stressful. I've told her how I feel, and she doesn't give me a definitive yes or no. She's with someone else, who just happens to be a better looking and older version of me, and every time I hang out with her, she's pouring her heart out for him, and I might as well be pouring mine down the toilet. It's so hard to love someone when all that they do with that affection is turn it around and punch you in the face with it.






We shouldn't be counting down until life is over, we should be doing everything we can every day to put a smile on our face and distract ourselves from that. I used to think material possessions did that, but the more I collect, the more I reflect, the more I realize that all of the joy brought from items is temporary. 




Try to forget the feeling you have when somebody tells you that you matter and that they're glad you're in their life. *That* is permanent. Yet it's the only thing I've wanted to hear for a long time.

17,"I can't believe this subreddit actually exists. People go into a draw and pledge to give a dollar. All the dollars are given to a random winner. They insist it isn't a lottery but here's one definition of a lottery which I found: ""a situation whose success or outcome is governed by chance."" Anyway, no point quibbling over the meaning of a word, it's a form of gambling regardless of what you call it.

And on average, people will lose as much money as they gain. If it goes on long enough, many of them will pay $10,000 before they ever win that amount (simply recovering their costs). Are people so against the concept of actually earning/creating wealth? Why not try to provide a good or service which people are willing to pay for? Everyone gains from that and it isn't random!

/r/millionairemakers are free to do what they want but I believe it is completely pointless. It might be better than a regular lottery because it's not-for-profit, although if not every participant pays, it is actually running at a loss for those who are paying.

It reminds me of the show Deal or No Deal which also shocked me with its stupidity. People carefully choose cases to open as if it makes any difference what number they pick - it's 100% random. The host/audience will often react along the lines of ""well done"" if they pick the right cases and the contestant will scold themselves for not focusing or listening to their intuition properly if they pick bad cases.

I served 4 years in the Air Force and once told someone I served with that the south was more tolerant because we have more people of color than the states up north. I didn't know what I was talking about. I was ignorant. I live in a town in Mississippi. There are hardly any basketball courts, and yet there are numerous tennis courts and baseball fields. I mention this because on the weekend of fathers day my kid wanted to play basketball. I couldn't find a single safe place for us to shoot hoops. The only public basketball court I know of is in the worst part of town. I was loathe to take her there because I had heard the rumors. I called my father who is a retired police officer to ask him where I could take her to play. He said he only knew of places where ""Niggers"" played. I am terrified that I am like him. I watched one of the episodes of the Daily Show where Trevor Noah talked about the Philando Castille case and I cried. Things are terrible for people of color in the United States. I do not make this post looking for absolution. I only want to state what I am  going through in hopes that it will allow others to analyze their own perspective. Ok, so maybe thats not totally true. I want people to tell me its okay, and that I cant control the world. But I promise that I will not remain silent. I will work hard to keep my eye on these issues and to interact with the communities that are currently feeling voiceless. I don't know where to start but I am not going to sit back and watch white supremacy take over the United States. Freedom means freedom for all, not just those with a lack of melanin.

My work gave everyone two free tickets to an event that's going on this weekend, and if you were here to go with me I'd be super excited about it, but I can't even make up my mind if I want to go since you won't be going with me. I don't even do fun stuff because I want to do it half the time, I do it to try and distract myself from missing you, but it never works. 

It's completely pathetic because it's been almost half a year since you suddenly up and left me. Everyone told me it would get easier as time went on but I'm just getting more miserable instead. It's been almost two months since we last spoke but I can't get you out of my head. I'm not happy without you. I have moments when I'm not actively *unhappy,* but you took all my joy in life away with you when you left. I'm disgusted with myself for being so weak and ridiculous, but I can't seem to stop. I was happy being single and was planning a great life of adventures by myself till you came along, but now it all seems pointless if you aren't there to do those things with me.",24Jun2017,4
34,"If you think otherwise, update that information in your brain, because it's wrong and outdated. I suggest reading the newest literature on the topic, or googling some. I'd like to see just one study from 2016 or 1017 that definitively proves spaying and neutering is beneficial.

Even vets, the good vets, tell me it's not needed and a bad practice. Because they keep up to date with the information on animals. Not all vets do.

Also, learn to interpret data and information, as well as studies and research, because if you think outside the box a little bit, you'll see how insane this practice is.

For example, testicular or ovary cancer prevention, or breast cancer prevention, ect.

That logic is so dumb.

That's like saying: ""oh well humans can get throat cancer, better remove the larynx""

""but wait they can also get foot cancer"" 

""okay remove the feet"" 

""but wait they can also get brain cancer"" 

""okay remove the brain"" 

""but wait, you can get cancer anywhere!""

""shit, kill everyone!""

See what I mean? Not to mention, your pet can no longer produce it's NATURAL hormones that it's supposed to. Your pet needs her ovaries, your pet needs his balls.

Not to mention, it's fucked up in general. Having your genitals removed forcefully against your will? News flash, animals feel emotion and pain and understand shit more than you think. If you can't see that, you shouldn't have a pet.

It's embarrassing for them, just like it would be for a human.

How would you feel, if you had your pussy sewn shut, and ovaries removed? Or your balls removed? Your pet feels the same way. That is fact. You cannot argue that. Go read some books and hit up google.

New literature, as well as many sources easily found on google, essentially say ""spaying and neutering is bad, and does more harm than good.""

It's not hard at all to train your pet.

Your going against nature.

They need those body parts to function normally.

""But muh pet funcshuns normahly""

No, it doesn't. It may seem normal to you, but if you are educated, you'd know that those lack of hormones has many negative effects, that you may not see on the outside.

Some replies of mine to others:

&gt; Yes. Let's just let animals fuck with no reprocussions. Stray animals left and right. Where's your counter argument against it rather than a statement with no facts whatsoever?

""Stray's are not pet's. Stay on topic. And if you're concerned about your pet fucking other animals, then train and control your pet. Not that hard.""

&gt; That's what you get when pets reproduce unchecked.

""Humans reproduce unchecked too""

&gt;It apparently isn't too obvious if it still happens.
You ""bother"" because it's too risky not to spay and neuter. So you pay a hundred or two for an OVH or neuter now as opposed to paying for an extensive and sometimes fatal surgery later. Pyometras and testicular cancer are not things you want to take chances on just because you feel your pet is ""healthy"". By the time these issues occur, it's almost too late to fix them.
Unaltered pets have been known to be more aggressive and form habits of marking throughout homes. And have you ever experienced being around cats in heat?! Besides the overtly loud calls and soiling everything, they want to get outside and cure their itch, then your female comes home pregnant then what? Those pets are sold or given away on places like Craigslist to people who are using them for God only knows what...they go to bad homes where they're abused and neglected. Yes, there are good homes that pets go to but that isn't always the case. It's about more than physical health for one pet! It's about protecting future pets from uncertain circumstances.

""And this based on misinterpretation of data and reality. It's the same thing as seeing something on facebook with ""facts"", then it gets misconstrued and twisted and misinterpreted, and people dont bother to look at other factors, for example, training your pet. I guarantee you a lot of people who say their pets are more aggressive unaltered, don't bother to learn anything about them and don't bother to try and train them, or see other variables that can cause these issues.""",24Jun2017,0
36,"26 year old, single guy. Have a good job that pays well, some close friends, and am physically healthy; I've always considered myself a happy person that people enjoy being around, but lately I cannot seem to get out of this hole I'm in. There are constantly squirrels running around in my head, it's difficult to get a good nights sleep, and I find myself getting lower and lower each day. It's beginning to be a struggle to get out of bed. 
I am worried that this will not pass and I will continue to be unhappy. Has anyone experienced these feelings and if so, what advice do you have? ",24Jun2017,6
39,"I've spent the last 6 months working everyday on making the business work and although our sales over the 6 months were at $75,000, our costs were much higher than I anticipated and we are closing down next week. It is so depressing to work so hard for 6 months only to have to cancel the whole endevour. ",24Jun2017,16
42,"For my own safety, I will refrain from mentioning the chain. I started about two months ago. The franchise owner owns a few other stores in the area. You're usually assigned to a store, but you can pick up shifts at other stores owned by the franchise.

I have a really good relationship with the store manager whose store I'm assigned to. He's generally pretty chill, and really fun to work with.

My problem is with the upper level management. There's a list almost as long as the NCAA rulebook for athletes about what you can and can't do (I'm slightly exaggerating, but almost everyone I work with feels that way.) And they're very picky about which rules they enforce strictly and which employees they enforce them on.

During the HR class I took explaining how to make the food, duties expected of me, and franchise-specific rules and policies, we were told that cell phones while on the clock were a big no-no. One instance, and you could be fired. Once I started working, however, I noticed that at my store and some others, a lot of the policies they told us to follow were nullified by manager decision, or regional manager. One of those seemed to be the phone policy. Almost everybody, including my manager, would use their phones if no customers were in line and most of the work was done. I was even told by an assistant manager at another store that in fact, it's permissible to use your phone once you get your work done.

However, twice I got a call from my manager's boss on the store phone to put my phone away, even though I had gotten all of my work done, and there were no customers in line. Not one of my co-workers has ever gotten a similar call for using their phone while on the clock.

At another store I've worked at frequently, there's an employee who is extremely rude to both customers and coworkers. Almost everyone, including her manager, dreads working with her. To fellow employees, she'll try to tell how they need to do every detail of their jobs and will argue with them if they don't follow her instructions. With customers, she'll display a rude attitude when asking what options they'd like, and even argue with them (I don't know what about, since she has a very thick accent). I also have reason to believe she steals from the cash register, since every time I worked with her, the cash numbers seemed off. She's worked there for two years, and to the best of my knowledge, she has yet to be suspended or terminated.

In contrast, a coworker at my store was suspended for showing up to work in flip flops twice.

Another thing I hate is how for many policy violations, instead of punishing the delinquent employees, they'll financially penalize the managers, or outright ban certain previously allowed things. One example is the employee meals. Prior to last week, everyone was allowed to make their own employee meals prior to the end of their shift. However, through security camera footage, they discovered that some employees were adding additional items to their meals that they didn't pay for. Instead of penalizing the employees who did that, they outright banned everyone but managers and closers from making their own meals. 

Also, most of the time, if an employee steals food, they don't watch security footage to find the employee. They simply subtract the cost of the stolen items from the manager's paycheck.

Sorry for the long wall of text.

TL;DR Working at fast food with lots of double standards from upper level management and little accountability for employees.",24Jun2017,2
