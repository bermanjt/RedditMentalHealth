I didn't want to ruin us.  Our friendship, if you could call it that because I don't know what to think anymore.

I said that I saw a guy taking the bricks this morning with a forklift, but I had none of his info because he didn't seem suspicious.

However, I just can't stop thinking about what she has done. What makes me question her even more is that, when we first met, she was dating another guy, who was very much absent from her life (they dated for 7 months and apparently they only hung out 4 or 5 times), but despite that, we spooned with each other at a friend's house (not really sexual but still - spooning with another guy when you're in a relationship is probably a no no). I feel like we have a great relationship, but whenever these thoughts get over intrusive, I start to be short with her and sometimes ignore her.

It's always the highlight of my night and I know she enjoys it too. Sometimes we'll just stand and talk for a full 20 minutes while I'm still on the clock. (oops) It's become a tradition at this point.

For a while she worked as much as I did, but then after a few years she started going to college and still comes back for the holidays. And no matter how many days, weeks or months go by without seeing her, as soon as I see her face again my soul leaves my body.

However, she has been in a relationship with someone for about 5 years...
As someone who has been cheated on before, I would never get involved in someone else's relationship. I used to work with this guy she's dating and he was an immature asshole, and from what I've heard he treats her like shit. But still...I can't allow myself to ruin someone's relationship, especially when I don't truly know how well it's going.

I also fear that the only reason she likes me as a person and has me walk her out is because I'm the only one who doesn't make sex jokes or try to hit on her. Which makes me think, if one day I ever told her how I feel...I wonder how badly it could go.

No matter how many girls go through my head, this one girl never leaves it. I don't know what to do with myself.",14Feb2017,6

24,"**Warning (contains spoilers): This is not a love story.**

Guys - care to share how have you met people in a foreign country?

I came to Riga a few months ago to work on my Phd paper, change setting (read: be away from my ex) and, frankly, because it's pretty cheap. Even if the weather here can be kind of depressing, I love the city - made friends soon enough and feel like fitting in pretty good.

One night out with guys after some third or probably fourth glass of beer, they came up with a challenge for me, which was meant to get me right in the middle of Riga dating scene. 

I had to go on 10 dates in 2 weeks. 

After two more beers this originally completely crazy idea started to shine like a diamond and after two more… Well I don't remember a shit.

Next morning I woke up with the most horrible hangover and vague memories about previous night. What I found out - first, I have accepted that crazy challenge and even made some serious bet on that (3 dozens of beer is a serious bet, right?). Second - now I had an account on a dating app called Mint, which is supposedly my billet d'or to the glorious victory. I will skip detailed report about all stages of pain I went through and go directly to the dates (check 5 stage lethal illness acceptance plan, if you want to know how I felt).

**Kristine - sleepy party girl.** We had a short online chat, and she was keen to meet for a coffee. I was nervous and impatient, could not wait for this crazy trip to start, this is why this date was one of the strangest. Have you ever tried to convince a girl to go on the first date at 9AM on Sunday? I was lucky - apparently people in Riga don't oversleep, as they simply don't sleep. At least Kristine did not, and came to meet me after having been out with friends all night long. She was really cute, but smelled of alcohol, which is not the biggest turn-on in the early Sunday morning. She was also very sleepy, and started to space out (even dozed off for a bit), so I walked her to a tram stop pretty soon. But - for real - she was indeed very cute.

**Olga, Ieva and Sabine - horrible triplets.** Don't misunderstand me - I did not go on a triple date with sisters! These dates did not even happen on the same day, in the exact order and were not actually blood-related. All three, the same as my first Riga date, were coffee dates arranged online, who might as well have been weird sisters. Olga just could not shut up - I don't think I had a chance to say more than 3 sentences during our 2 hour meeting; Ieva, as I found out soon enough, could not actually speak English and filled conversation with loud, and frankly - not too pleasant laughter, but third one… I don't remember what she said or in which language. That chick has used so much perfume before our rendez-vous, that it made me slightly sick and I just could not think of anything else, but a breeze of fresh air.

**Anna - the most romantic… and weird date.** I've met her previously at friend's party, she had dreamy eyes and a mysterious smile. So finally I had a very good reason to find my guts to ask her out - she seemed more than happy to agree, and even said I don't have to make any plans - she knew exactly what she wanted to do. And she did… we spent about 3 hours in Central market and different super markets, looking for blueberries, which have disappeared from the face of the earth. As did Anna after this cold, equally beautiful and strange day.

**Sandra - looking for escape.** This started a bit old-school. My Latvian friend Maris gave me a number of “this hot chick from Uni”. So we decided to go out with him and their fellow students. I was promised a real treat - we went to one of so popular escape rooms… And, boy, a treat did I get. Sandra was absolutely terrified by being locked in the room, so she just sat there quietly, huge tears running over her cheeks. True to the name of place - I could not wait to escape that. 

**Rita - noir désir.** When I saw her for the first time on Mint, she took my breath away. So she did when I met her in real life - being nothing like her profile pictures. I mean - her face should be as pretty as on pics under all those piercings, heavy layer of cosmetics and badass attitude, but… We had a beer in alternative music club in the old town and parted our ways - she stayed there with friends, I walked away… to another date in fact.

**Laura - can you see the sea?** I borrowed friend's car and followed detailed instructions to pick her up in some Soviet time suburbia, on our way to Jurmala (coastal town close to Riga).  After some waiting in the car, she asked me to come up to help her with something. I was greeted by curious smile of her elderly mum, excited snoring of a very fat pug and hysterical request to take apart an old cupboard. We never made it to the sea, but at least breakfast pancakes next morning were super tasty.

**Sasha and Olesya - not every ticket wins.** Sasha was a really sweet girl, who even spoke French - I do think that I was more of a training possibility - we still chat online sometimes. But Olesya… She asked to meet at Laima clock and then send me a message “sorry, I just don't think it will work”. Oh well, some people apparently can resist French charm.

Aftermath of this - I had a blast. Maris and Eriks decided that I won the bet, even if Olesya did not came (they figured she might have came to see me and found not to her taste). So I've drunk that beer, decided to write it down and ask Laura out again - but that's another story.

36,"**There will be plot details and other spoilers in this post!**

*Note: Posted this originally to /r/movies, but it got removed*.

Full disclosure: I am a dude in my thirties who never read the Fifty Shades books. I did, however, watch the first film adaptation when it came out on Cinemax last year. Actually, I watched maybe half of it. I thought it might make for good spank material. It did not. Nevertheless, I am confident I got the jist of it. 

First off, there were nearly six men in the packed theater I attended last Saturday night. Like most of them (except for maybe the lone wolf in the sweatpants sitting third row center), I was not there of my own accord. Rather, I accompanied a significant other of the female persuasion, whom I gather are the intended audience. 

I admit when she first suggested the film for a date night, I was somewhat apprehensive. To put it plainly, it wasn't the type of movie that I would typically pay money to see. 

In the end, though, I offered little resistance. After all, she didn't complain when I took her to laser tag on our first date and also our fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, and eleventh dates. The least I could do was go along with something that she enjoyed. Cause that's just the kind of guy I am. Also, I wanted to get laid. I'm that kind of guy, too. Anyway, here are my thoughts on the movie.

What is **Fifty Shades Darker**? I guess it's basically an erotic love story. Kind of like ~~8~~ 9 1/2 Weeks, except without a coked-up Mickey Rourke to class it up. It follows the continuing adventures in assplay of conservative English Lit major and shrinking violet Anastasia Steele and her relationship with tortured billionaire, playboy, helicopter pilot, hair salon part owner, buttplug aficionado, and all-around douchebag Christian ""Dorian"" Grey.

As the opening scenes unfold, we learn Ana and Christian are not actually together. Something happened at the end of the first movie apparently. Like, she didn't want to be his ""submissive"" anymore. I was only half watching at that point. More of my attention was devoted to finding a lesbian video featuring at least one actress who looked like my ex than it was to following the plot. 

 As it turns out, my failure to pay attention didn't really matter. Minutes into Fifty Shades Darker, Christian was already ""renegotiating terms"" for another go round at the whole boyfriend/girlfriend thing. All I can say is he must have read ""The Art of the Deal"" at some point because the two of them are back together before most of the audience has had a chance to go for a second handfull of popcorn, which I made my date pay for.

The bulk of what makes up the rest of the the movie are scenes depicting Ana and Christian learning the in's and out's of having a ""vanilla"" relationship. For those who don't know, vanilla is a popular flavoring derived from orchids. In the instance of Fifty Shades Darker, however, vanilla refers to a relationship that is less about nipple clamps and expanding the diameter of ones asshole and more about missionary sex and accepting asshole diameter as is.

Throughout, Christian is comes off as a massively possessive dickhole with all the charisma of a wet phone book. He creeps and broods and makes his maid uncomfortable. He's even rude and dismissive to a waiter. That - along with being rich and capable of doing a pull up without shitting himself - are just a couple clues that he isn't a Redditor. Yet he is perfectly cast. Why? Because of all the oohing and ahhing film audience whenever he took off his shirt **(edit - no, he does not hang dong)**. Also, by the time the movie was over, the floors in the theater were damp than I remember them being upon arriving.

At least ""possessive dickhole"" qualifies as a character trait, though. Anastasia is left pretty much empty-handed in that department. I'll give Dakota Johnson the benefit of the doubt, here. After all, she's not given much to work with. The fact that she can keep a straight face while reciting a line like ""I was being romantic and then you just go and distract me with your kinky fuckery"" is a credit to her. Luckily, there are a couple moments when she does shine. More on that later.

While Christian and Ana's romance takes centerstage, a handful of subplots fill out the rest of the running time. One involves sexual harassment in the workplace. Another is about a corporate buyout. Yet another involves one of Christian's previous submissives stalking Anastasia. In fact, the movie at times threatens to become some sort of suspense thriller. Luckily, the narrative re-routes back to more interesting territory, like crowded elevator finger-banging and how to incorporate a modified chin-up bar into lovemaking. 

Oh, and speaking of 9 1/2 Weeks, it seems someone thawed out Kim Basinger so she could make an appearance. She plays Mrs. Elena Bitch Troll Robinson aka the older woman who taught young Christian to channel his anger away from violence and alcohol and towards more healthier outlets, like spanking and  her vagina and spanking her vagina.

There is a non-sexual climax in Fifty Shades Darker, though it is fairly anticlimactic. Basically, a situation arises and the future becomes uncertain. Some of the characters are put in a room and given a couple minutes to contemplate the nature of life and death. Then, *poof,* the situation resolves itself. Whole thing takes about six minutes. 

So what do I think about the movie? Do I believe there is a hidden masterpiece lurking just below the veneer of hot sex and lukewarm dialogue? Do I think 
 we be praising it as an ahead-of-its-time satire about eroticism in the post-911 world? Will this become the Showgirls of the twenty first century? 

No. In my opinion, it is mediocre. But did I *enjoy* the experience of seeing Fifty Shades Darker? Hell. Yes.

I think it happened somewhere around twenty minutes in. Ana and Christian are getting ready to go out. As she fixes her hair, he whips out a pair of stainless steel Ben Wa balls and waves them in her face. 

""You're not going to put those in my butt..."" Ana says while most likely recalling events from the first movie. 

Turns out, they weren't for her butt. Christian had other plans for them. Specifically, he makes her slobber on them, then bends her over and slides them moistened balls in her vag. I myself let out an audible gasp at this development, as did the numerous middle-aged women to my right. I think one of them might have tinkled a bit.

Christian doesn't stop there, though. He then proceeds to take Ana, balls in (camel) tow, to a charity gala hosted *by his parents.* Throughout the event, Ana squirms in ecstacy with each sudden movement. Christian cracks a joke and her laughter is cut short because she has to hold back an orgasm. This part of the movie, to me, ends up being rather thought provoking. As in, it made me wonder how many women go around with Ben Wa balls inside them all day and could that possibly explain why my Nana has been so jumpy lately? 

The Ben Wa balls bit was probably the most enjoyable set piece, but it was far from the only enjoyable one. I won't detail the rest here, but there were plenty of moments when me, my date, and the rest of the audience were laughing and engaged in a way that I rarely see in movie theaters, even during the most comedic of comedies.

In the end, I left Fifty Shades Darker pleasantly surprised, yet ready to move one with my life. But this movie wasn't done with me just yet. While walking through the mall with my lady friend, I could tell there was something different about her. Normally she's run down after our date nights. Laser tag will do that to a person. At least, if you're doing it right it will.

But she didn't appear run down. Quite the opposite, in fact. There was twinkle in her eye, a skip in her step, and a song in her heart. I asked if maybe she had forgotten to take her antipsychotics again. She said, no, that wasn't it. Told me point blank she wanted to ""hop on my pogo stick"" and ""ride it all the way to Albuquerque.""

For those who don't know, a pogo stick is a spring loaded device used by children and certain extreme sports athletes as a way of travelling in an inefficient manner. In this case, however, it referred to my johnson. That having been made clear, we rushed back home as quickly as my Malibu could manage.

Once we got back to my place, it was game on. No small talk, no foreplay, no frantic search for a condom. Brought back memories of attending SUNY Oneonta. In fact, I didn't even have a chance to walk around the block to get the farts out, as is tradition. She literally said ""let's do some kinky fuckery,"" then slapped me in the face with a rolled up newspaper. The New York Post, I believe, which made it all the more demeaning.

My Crocs and argyle socks were barely off before she had my hands bound with duct tape and my eyes blindfolded with the tie I used to wear when I worked at Olive Garden (still smelled like alfredo sauce). Up until that point, she had done nothing to me that I hadn't done to myself at some point in time already. But then she jellied a pair of spit lubed Titleists up my asshole, even though I'm certain I told her at some point I don't care for golf. From that point on, I was in undiscovered country. 

Eventually it came time to ""bang it out"" if you know what I mean (I mean sex). She decided to opt out of the ""oral package"" that I offer all my dates. It consists of seventeen minutes of vigorous cunilingus followed up by cocktails and a reading from the Book of Ezekiel. Frankly, she didn't need it. Her panties were already as wet as a Mumbai street urchin's feet during monsoon season. 

Since I'm a gentleman, I shall spare you the rest of the gory details. I won't tell you about how she put a bar of soap in a sock and wailed on my scrotum with it. I will forgo the parts involving her vagina sneezing on my neck. And certainly will not recount events that led to her pulling hardened candle wax out of my arethra. 

All I will say is this: the lovemaking was of a variety I never knew existed. It was as if dolphins were singing next to my futon that night. I felt like I was being ass-fucked, but in the heart. 

It comes as little surprise that I forgot myself during the course of things. So loud and violent was my *pasion* (it means ""passion"" in Spanish), the downstairs neighbors actually stopped me during my morning beer run the flowing day and asked if I happened to have held a slam poetry event in my apartment the night before. I said no, but there would be one next Thursday and they weren't invited. They might have bought my story, too, if not for the smell of sex emanating from my face. That's a story for another day. 

Being we are at the end of my post, I leave you with this: while hilariously bad at times, Fifty Shades Darker, when viewed under the right circumstances, is a worthy piece of entertainment and can be enjoyed even by those who exist outside the presumed target audience of older women. It also makes for a profoundly effective date movie.

I'm not able to do anything on my own due to other constraints so this is the least I can do for someone who loves travelling!
Please make the photos as creative or in front of something to show its from another country/state/city if time permits!

I know this is not the place for requests like these, But I was not sure where to post this.
Thanking you!

And muted, when I made fun of the moderators: You have been temporarily muted from r/The_Donald. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/The_Donald for 72 hours.

Oh no!  What am I gonna do now for 72 whole hours?  ",14Feb2017,0
51,"Everyone already knows what fucking day it is. This artificial holiday. I know, as in the part of me that thinks can understand, that this means nothing. The chocolate, flowers, artificial romanticism, the push to have somebody to spend money on...these things are cheap tricks. Lures. They're there to make you feel as though you don't matter unless you have someone to buy this cheap shit for. I don't. I never have. 

Let me provide some background. I'm in my early 20's, working retail, with no future prospects. I stock and I drink, with some videogames and Jiu-Jitsu sprinkled in between. I'm fat, but losing weight at a good pace. I'm male, as you can safely assume. I hate myself. I really, really fucking hate myself. I've downed half a handle of wine since I got home an hour and a half ago. I'm pacing myself. I could have finished it along with another at this point, but I don't want to get that far from shore tonight, because I have to go back to my shit job in the morning. This is my fault. I created this future with my actions and my inaction. 

There's this girl that I love. I've never felt this way for any other human being. I never thought I'd fall in love, yet here we are. She has the passive ability to lighten my mood, she soothes my internal storms, she makes me realize that not every influence in life has to be negative. She smiles, I melt. It's that simple. However, she does not now, nor will she ever return that affection. This is why I want to kill myself. 

Let me expand upon that last point. I'm a virgin. I've never had a kiss. I've never engaged in a relationship. So believe me when I say, I was shocked to feel this emotion which most would identify as love. I've felt all kinds of frustrated lust, I've felt light affection for several girls, but my raging anxieties and utter lack of self worth caused me to convince myself that I'm incapable of ever being with a member of the opposite sex in a non-platonic way. I accepted this. Then I met her. I feel an impossible amount of raw affection for this girl. Seeing her was like my first time seeing in color. I was used to this black-and-white silent movie, and then she danced in with the full, visible spectrum sewn into her outfit and music in her wake. I never would have known these emotions had she not. 

But, on to suicide. I've felt the urges before. I quieted them. I've understood, coldly, why I want to die sometimes. I countered the arguments with plenty of reasons why I should live, even if I don't necessarily want to. But this new shit, this love bullshit...it complicates things. I like this girl to a destructive degree. She added something to my perception of the world which was simply not there beforehand. The fact that she does not occupy this role which I crave her in, that I can't show these affections that I feel, that I can't act on any of this passion that wells up in storms and leaves me in ruins day after fucking day...it hurts. It hurts so badly that I'm not sure that I can continue dealing with it. She's become so important to me, she struck me so deeply, that the idea of continuing without her seems worse than death. 

I know I'm silly. I know I'm being dramatic. But this is what I feel. So, today, stocking my department, just me and my thoughts in this silent box of passing time...I couldn't deal. I couldn't handle all the guys striding past with flowers and chocolate in hand. I couldn't deal with the heart balloons and romantic bullshit swirling around me. I'm denied the one thing in life I've ever truly wanted to pursue, yet all these men so effortlessly get to throw it in my face that they have what they want already. 

I hate it almost as much as I hate my own identity. Yet, there, at the lowest I've ever felt, at the bottom of my emotional well...something pushed back. It was like anger, but I wasn't mad at anything. I realized that so many people in my life, who I care about deeply, feel similar things. Life shits on them too. How can I help them up if I can't even stand? How can I leave them in their own sorrows while I sit here in this puddle of self-loathing and lash myself over things I can't have, things I can't control? 

I can never be with the only person I've ever cared to be with. She's taken, and wouldn't want me even if she wasn't. However, I can still make a positive difference in the lives of those who try and make a difference in my own. I can help. I can be useful. 

Multiple corporations tried to convince me to kill myself today, and I wound up continuing to live, and with a burning resolve to not let those I love rot in this same quagmire. 

Do the same. Fight. Stand up. I'm drunk, but you get what I mean. Fuck Hallmark. Fuck emotions. Live. ",14Feb2017,1

55,"You can hire people to downvote my posts, you can change the algorithm so posts don't show up on the front page, you can slander him, you can call him names, you can mock him on Saturday Night Live, you can do *anything* but it won't change my support for him.  You can call me stupid, but I'm in Mensa.  You can call me ignorant, but I have a college degree from a top 25 public university.  You can call me anything you want.  It doesn't matter and it doesn't hurt my feelings.  I'm on the Trump train and I will be for 8 more years.  There is literally NOTHING you can say or do to convince me otherwise.  Oh, and before the 3rd debate I was a nevertrumper.  I hated him.  I wanted him to lose.  I wanted him to have a heart attack during the primaries so my candidate would win.  But now?  Now I'm rabid.  You won't stop us.  You *can't* stop us.  I'm on the front lines of the meme war of 2017 and I'm loving every minute of it.  ",14Feb2017,0

59,"So in a few hours valentines day will be over. Thank god!
I had classes today and I would spend 1 hour of them with my best friend and a few of our other friends.
My best friend (I have a crush on her) was sick today, so I ended up sitting with my other friends (one of them knows about my feelings for my best friend).
I still had a lot of fun though.
So the friend who knows about it has been feeling sorry for me for the past few days because a few months ago my best friend told me that she was not interested. Back then we were just friends and we've gotten very close since then. We chat everyday, even if we had talked for a few hours that day in person.
So I knew the same was going to happen today and that it would suck.

Since at the point where we left class we had no idea if she was sick or not, I texted her asking about it because I know she gets really heavy migraine attacks.
I talked with my other friends for about an hour and then left, as soon as I left my best friend started texting me about what she was going to draw (as she always does) and asking about my opinion at a few points in her progress and it happened to be about something I like.
So we kept chatting for about 30 minutes until my train left. Then she send me a few updates while I was on the train and as soon as I got home we started chatting for a bit longer.

So chatting with her is already pretty difficult.
But then she starts sending me memes (as usual), the memes were from something specific and she complained that the ones I've send were ones that she already saw since we often look on the same site and she has been looking for some time. So I joked that she had the whole day to search for memes and then she mentions that she only started when she got in her bath when she send me the first one.

Now while I'm writing this she's constantly texting me about her favorite character in a series and how she would love to date someone like that, while she was describing him, she was describing me but then good looking.

So I thought my valentines day would be horrible as always.
Instead it went from good to bad, back to good and now it's constantly shifting.

60,"We met years ago but nothing ever came from it.

You hurt me and I moved 9,101 miles away for the best part of the year wandering and roaming, but the latter was happening regardless.

We got back in contact, almost exactly 3 years later after my own rocky relationship troubles and these troubles finally broke down. 

Then I broke down, the drink, the drugs, the crippling darkness. Yet, you were there for me. I now realise that 3 years which we were in silence, you were there for me. You always have been there for me and I'm sure you always will. 

We put each other through hell for a few months. Everything was a mess, then the storm calmed.

Now it's slowly happening and I couldn't be happier. 

You make me happy and you make me smile, and l do the same for you. The first time you kissed me was magical. 

I'm just terrified that i'm going to lose you again, after all we've been through. 

What we have is new; but we have, has always been. 

You are my world and you can ask anything of me.

I love you. 

Happy Valentines.",14Feb2017,1
