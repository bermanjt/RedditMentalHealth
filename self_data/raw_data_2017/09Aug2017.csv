Other than this it seems like an app like this doesn't exist! I know that's not possible, obviously they're out there but like where on Earth do I find it? Censorship like you see on tv, where do I find an app like this?

5,"My gf is very social person, so she often hangs out with friends. Whenever she mentions spending time with one of her friends, I  always just start thinking about how she could be cheating on me.  Almost all of the time, the friend is either a gay guy or a girl, but even if it is a straight guy, I feel like I should have enough trust that it doesn't bother me.

She is pretty attractive and often when we go out, someone will hit on her or give me some praise for being with her, so I'm sure the opportunity is there.

It probably stems from her having more sexual experience than me and me being insecure in that regard. I also think she is a more superficial person, often mentioning how attractive people when first describing them. It could also be that my first relationship ended because I cheated on my then gf, and then broke it off a few days later without her knowing I had cheated.

The thing is that I don't even think I care that much about this relationship. I don't really see a future for it, but for some reason just the possibly of being cheated on scares me. It worries me that I'll never be able to get past this and always have to find a way to end relationships before I can be cheated on.

I already recognize that being cheated on isn't even the end of the world. It is just one hurtful person that will no longer be in my life. I don't think I've felt a strong enough bond with someone that that would devastate me. I feel like I almost want to be cheated on now so I can get it over with and actually know what it's like. I think the anticipation and worry is worse than the actual situation.

7,"Warning: I'm frazzled as hell so I'm kind of all over the place. Also, immaterial things changed for anonymity.

Alright, so. A lot of background. My wife's father is an emotionally and verbally abusive asshole. Always has been, always will be. Currently, we're renting a house he owns (probably the biggest mistake we've made in our lives). I'm unemployed and disabled, and receive disability benefits, my wife commutes about half an hour to and from work. She's currently going to school to get a better job, but we're plenty financially secure. I'm not worried about money. We live in a rural town, lots of farms and not much else around us, and we only have one car, so when she's at work, I'm kinda stuck at home (I can still drive).

We're currently juggling like three decisions at once:

1. Her job is stressful, but pays well. She's been offered an easier job for less pay, elsewhere, but it would be about a 45 minute commute instead of half an hour. That's 90 minutes a day of commuting

2. We're also considering moving up closer to the job she was offered, but we looked a dozen rental properties and we hate the layout that pretty much every single house in this area has. Given how much time I spend at home, I need to like it.

3. We're also flipflopping between renting and buying. We can afford to buy in this area.

Now, the issue, and the thing that's giving us both ulcers: her dad was usually pretty easy to just ignore. He only bothered us once a month, maybe, but recently, he's decided that we pissed him off (for reasons I won't go into), and now he's bugging us every fucking day. Literally every day, a call, or an email, or a text message. He's trying to make his financial problems our problems. I don't want them, but I also don't want to tell him to fuck off because he's an explosive asshole and I honestly fear for my safety because he has an explosive temper, should not be allowed to own guns (imo), and yet does.

So he's harassing us, trying to force us to move out by the end of next month, and we don't know what to do. We'd like to buy a house because we can afford it, but we don't feel like we have time. We're also considering offering to buy the house from him, because we _really like this house_. It has the layout we like, it has space for all of our stuff, and we've been here almost a year; we're comfortable.

I just don't know what to do about this guy. I honestly want to tell him to fuck right off and go to hell, but he knows where we live and I don't trust the police to arrive in less than an hour if I do need to call them. Also he has keys to our house since he's the fucking landlord.",09Aug2017,6

11,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for it but...

I'm trying a new way to battle my depression and my overall feeling shitty about everything in my life. It's easy to admit that I feel like shit. Or that I feel like I look like shit or that I don't feel loved. Or perhaps that I don't deserve to be loved. See, I just did it. It took me 20 seconds to write (and that's how long I lasted during my first sexual encounter).

I've heard of a technique where one reflects on happy memories, sandwiching them between sprints of dissecting the weird and bad shit that happened.

For example:

1. I was lonely
2. first relationship resulted in a breakup.

Between the two, you just need to add ""And this is what was great about my first relationship"". But it's difficult.

I started writing a story about my first kiss. And every word that I wrote was met with sarcasm, or cynicism, or just hate.

I played spin the bottle at a camp with a bunch of class mates. And holy shit was it exciting but as I wrote down that sentence, my immediate thought was:

1. did anyone really want me there?
2. did they suffer my presence because I ""tagged along"" with others?

I tried to keep writing. I wrote about the girl I kissed. She...she was perfect. She's beautiful to this day. I remember kissing her, and how it felt. And how my face flushed. And how my heart beat. And how i desperately wanted the bottle to land on her again.

But as I wrote that, several things immediately popped up in my head:

1. she really wanted to kiss one of the other guys.
2. she doesn't bother to answer any of my messages today
3. did she just suffer my presence for the sake of the other guy being there?
4. was my first kiss with someone I probably disgusted?

The dialogue goes on and on this way. I remember how I wanted to impress the girls when we played truth or dare and they dared me to run around the camp shirtless. So I did. And they laughed. And it was fun but:

1. were they laughing AT me instead of with me?
2. were they just trying to get rid of me for more quality time with the other guys?
3. did they suffer my presence?

I barely got two paragraphs in before getting sick of it. It made me want to throw up. I tried to think of another memory.

I remember when I first talked to my best friend. She...she's amazing. I absolutely love her and I love that we're still best friends, decade or so later.

I remember how awesome it was but then things started to pop into my head:

1. did she suffer my presence and my messages?
2. did she find me creepy?

We had a falling out a few years later so my mind jumped into that. and I started to feel like shit because of the things I did because I felt like shit and my life felt like shit. And I was a huge piece of shit.

13,"I don't know where to put this but I need to write it down and get it out. I work at a resort as a cook, and lately I've been fooling around with another cook. We spent the day together, it was nice. I drove us up to the next town over and we hung out and ran errands. As the sun began to set, we decided to get a hotel room and go out drinking, so I wouldn't drive intoxicated. We got dinner then joined another co-worker out for drinks. After half a dozen shots I was pretty drunk and ended up splitting off to take an uber back to the hotel alone but friend was wasted and continued to drink. 
I was in the shower when he came home. He barged in the bathroom and yelled how I abandoned him. I tried to get him to leave. He wouldn't. He climbed in the shower with me and grabbed at me. I lost control and started screaming at him to fuck off and leave me alone. He left me in the shower.
When I got out he began screaming that it was his room and get the fuck out. Details get blurry as I hurry to gather my things. We're both screaming and he kept grabbing me, and I was hitting him to try to get away. He yelled that I was a psycho bitch and had to get the fuck out. I made it to the door and that's when he grabbed me. Before I knew what was happening his hands we around my throat and there was a crazed look in his eye. He was squeezing so hard. 
I must have passed out because the next thing I remember I was on the floor sobbing. He was on the phone taking to someone about his rights. I grabbed my backpack and ran out the door and down the stairs, with him at my heels. Sobbing, locked myself in the car, and he we howling at me asks banging on the passenger side window. I was really scared. A lifetime later he stumbled away towards the hotel room and I ran into the lobby for help.
The woman at the front desk was so kind. My so-called friend stormed in the lobby, demanding that she not let me go because I was drunk and hysterical. Then he began shouting about the things he left in my car, demanding access. She calmly convinced him to return to the hotel room, then called the cops. I told her what I could of what happened, but emotion took over. She checked in with the night clerk then drove me the 40 grueling miles back to the resort. She called the night clerk upon our arrival and learned that my former companion was arrested, and the cops were waiting for a statement from me. I told them everything I could and they charged him with felony strangulation. I thanked the front desk clerk and crashed on the dorm couch, unsure whether an officer was coming to collect me for more information. 
The next day a victim advocate spoke with me. Apparently my attacker was too intoxicated to go in front of a judge at his 10am hearing and they needed a statement of what I wished to happen. I opted for a restraining order. Even if he returned to work, he wasn't allowed to work with me. I pressed charges against him for what he did. He has another hearing the next day to have his charges read and bail posted. 
I skipped out on work because I couldn't face anyone. I knew word would get out about what  happened. Everyone knows something went down but no one knows what. All day I've been shaking, feeling frost in my bones and a sickness in my stomach. I'm writing this likes than 24 hours after it all happened. It feels so surreal. I just want everything to go away. My chef and the hr director have received my  two week's notice. I don't know how else to cope so I'm putting this here as a cathartic exercise. Thanks for reading.",09Aug2017,83
14,"So, I've never been able to fit in, my whole life. I'm 21. I've been Diagnosed with ADHD-C and ODD since I was 6, and I've been depressed since I was 9.

I've always had a short temper. When I'm mad, It's almost like an old friend where I enjoy becoming mad. I'm not sure why. It normally starts with irritation with somebody. I don't regularly get mad, usually I just go with the flow and I brush most things off, but sometimes I don't and I just snap; I become very mean very quickly, But the thing is, when I'm being mean it's usually verbal and I use facts to attack them, I be little them, attack their morals, their beliefs, call them out on their stupidity and I don't hold back. I normally find what makes people tick, and I use it very, very well. And when it's over, I don't feel remorse.

I'm also very very charismatic, I know how to talk to people. I can usually get what I want out of a conversation. Mostly it's just information, but sometimes I use it to get favors, or use it to get customers or co-workers to like me more. '

I'm normally the center of attention, because I'm loud and I tell lots of jokes, so many jokes, and I know it annoys people sometimes but I usually don't care. My jokes aren't regular jokes, their normally reactive to something else happening or just really weird story ideas I like to tell people. But I can always come up with something on the fly. 


I'm also really empathetic, I love talking to people, I love interacting with people, I don't like seeing people suffer or anything. In fact I do what ever I can to help them, if I can.
But I can just turn it off, I can look at someone in pain and if I am thinking about other things, or am occupied by another task I can just turn it off or ignore it. 

I almost never lie, I really really hate lying. When I do it just digs at me. But I'm really good at it. 

I'm also always paranoid people don't like me...

tldr; I have problems and I wonder if other people are like me.

15,"We were rivals in High School. We hated one another. Though she was the biggest *c-word* I knew back then, I realized something recently. Looking back to our third year, I was passing her in the hallways and decided to casually call her a bitch. She retaliated a few minutes later by slamming my head into my locker. At that point, I'd never hated anyone more. A week later, however, she approached me and apologized to my face. That was very unexpected at the time, but I only recently thought more about it. 

Maybe she *wasn't* such a bitch after all. Her apology showed that she actually had a heart. When I thought about that, I then thought about what I currently fancy in a woman. Turns out, she has every single one of those qualities. Not only is she not completely heartless, but she's beautiful, strong willed, physically capable, and can hold a fight to the very end.

Now, four years later, I haven't been able to get her out of my head. I don't even know where to begin finding out what she's up to these days. She hasn't any Facebook account and that's about the end of the road for tracking down old classmates of mine.",09Aug2017,4

It finally escalated to tonight, when I dreamt I was driving my car, ""woke up"" to my pitch black room which was normal except impossible to see in, and then I moved my sheets, and felt *something that was definitely not my dog* I sleep with *spooning* me and wrapping my blanket on my head so I couldn't see, at which point I started struggling to move my arms, couldn't move them at all, and tried to open my eyes, which finally broke the hold the nightmare had on me, waking me up.

17,"So: I am scheduled to get LASIK eye surgery in 2 weeks.  I've been thinking about this procedure for years, and was told I qualify about two months ago.  I've had glasses since I was five (I'm mid-twenties now), and it would be a dream to not have to wear glasses anymore.  Up until this point, I've been 99.9% excited, and the actual procedure itself doesn't really phase me.  

However, this evening, I stumbled upon the dark, dark rabbit hole of ""risks"" and ""failures"".  It sucks not being able to see more than three inches in front of my face without glasses, but I also don't want to have such extreme eye pain that I want to end my life (this is a thing that I found on the internet.. Yes, seriously. :/).  And although I know to think of everything that I read with a hint of scepticism... I am now currently terrified of the long-term effects of surgery.

18,"I'm an Australian Year 9 student. At my school we have to use iPads (by use I mean we had to buy them before Year 7 started) for school work.

The story I'm about to tell is a long one, and it starts off unrelated.

In March 2016 (Year 8), I was playfighting with my sister after school and I was kicking my bag around pretending it was a person.

I found out the screen was broken when I got home. So, got it taken into the repair shop and in a week or two had it fixed.

At the time the Lightning cable which I used from the very beginning broke apart, so I took the route of getting one of those third-party cables from the Reject Shop (one of those bargain shops here in Australia).

It worked at first, but after a while, it screwed over, so I kept getting new cables. They all seemed to screw over, but I could still enjoy charging my iPad normally while they lasted.

In June this year, I got my latest third-party cable. However, it wouldn't work. It only charged when it was completely shut off, or if I pulled out and plugged back in the plug countless times.

I suspected it was the plug pack I was using; it's a HTC/Android plug pack. I lost my Apple USB adapter around the time the screen got replaced.

But from what I was reading, people said they were able to charge it perfectly with an Android plug pack, but I was still suspicious.

Well today when I came to school I took it in to our IT department (who helped me find the 1970 bug on the iPad last year as well).

One of the dudes tried plugging it in but it wouldn't work, and the conclusion they came to was that the port was screwed.

Perhaps it was me pulling out and plugging in that third-party charger so many times for it to work. (So it was technically my fault completely)

Anyway, I came back home and regretfully plugged it in so I could shut it off and wait for it to charge slowly, but the second I plugged it in, it made the sound and it said 5% charged.

I haven't pulled it out, and I'm scared to in case it won't happen again. What do you think?

EDIT: Right now we're going at 43%, I've only had it plugged in for an hour. So it really is charging.

EDIT 2: Thanks for the suggestions. My battery is currently at 95%, still charging.",09Aug2017,24

20,"My life has always had one clear cut goal, ever since I was a kid in the single digits (heard it from my father and it stuck) - to be self made. I finished high school with excellent grades (a renowned high school) and got into the best college in my country (Scandinavian), but I was never interested in finishing because I was never interested in using that piece of paper. But I stayed.. I started my own company with friends but it was hard doing both, we didn't get anywhere, nor did I get anywhere in school either. I didn't even get far at all. I couldn't focus on entrepreneurship because of the anxiety and stress school brought. But I couldn't get myself to drop out. My parents, friends, family, expected me to finish, I had so much potential according to them.

That damn potential everybody talks about, my mom crying because she sees everyone succeed around me while I stand still, doing nothing. But nobody understands the dread I feel when I think about working 9-5 for the rest of my life, for someone else. Regardless of the pay. I had a part time job to pay my rent and I excelled there and my boss wanted to promote me and have me work full time for an insane pay and I never even for a second felt tempted.. No matter how much I've said so in the past, until I was put in a situation where I was offered that life, I never truly knew if I'd be tempted to settle and take that life. But when I was faced with that option, I felt nothing, and that's when I knew I couldn't keep going like this. I needed to choose a path.

A few months later now that the next semester is about to start I had to choose, keep standing still or choose a path. I decided to just to go for it, drop out of school face the shame and go for what I want in life. But I'm so scared, you have no idea. I have no idea if my ambitions are even possible. What if my business ventures fail.. What if I'm putting my life on something destined to fail. I'm so scared, I'm doing it but I'm terrified. What if I can't keep going and I'm stuck there, 35 years old, with nothing to show for it. Looking for jobs in the nearest starbucks.

I have to choose something though and the only thing I know is that the only thing I feel when I think about school is pure depression and apathy, same goes with the life it gives me. While the other option is what I've always wanted most in life. But the former guarantees a good life on paper, but not the life I want. The latter is a gamble.

Today I chose to go for what I want in life, scary as it may be I really don't want any other life than that. I sent my dropout form and I'm officially a drop out. It feels like I'm at a crossroad between crumbling down with crippling depression or pull myself out of it and focus everything I have on pursuing my goals. All my life I've been half-assing everything because I could. I really want to see what it feels like to going all out and going for whatever I want without pause. So here we go.

Hello Reddit! I need some personal help, my anxiety is driving me crazy and it's crippling please help; 

My anxiety is linked to fear of harm or death since chocking on food 5 years ago, since then it's triggered feelings of how easy it is to die or be in harm over something so little and even a necessity in life. 

I can't enjoy my life and go out without over analysing the day and look for possible harm in my day and how I can get help if that happens. 

I'm obsessed over my health and constantly think I'm having a heart attack whenever my heart rate increases over 100 and palpitates- even though I know I have a healthy resting heart rate of 75. 

I want to enjoy my life and my fear of being hurt and dying is ruining it in every way I need to know firstly am I alone in this obsessive thinking? And how can I tackle it head on and try and over come this?

28,"Something I've been told by multiple people and read multiple times online is that ""you'll find someone when you stop looking for them"". And I believe that to be true. My first and only girlfriend I've had up to this point in my life, I honestly believe I was able to date because I wasn't *trying* to find date anyone. I started talking to and hanging out with this girl who was really fun and beautiful and it just sort of happened.

Now, I think that even if I met a girl who I could feel the way that I felt about her towards, I wouldn't be able to date them because I'm so focused on trying to find a girlfriend. Every girl I meet, I feel like I view them as a dating candidate rather than just a person who happens to be a girl. I never used to do that.

I used to just be myself around them and if they didn't like it then so be it, but now I feel like I try too hard to be cool and ""dateable"". 

Another problem is that compared to the time in my life where I met my ex, I am much less social. I graduated college so don't go to parties anymore. I got a full time job in a field without many women my age compared to working a part time job at Target in a college town with other college students.

I was thinking about volunteering or becoming a regular at some bar or coffee shop or even getting a dog and hanging out at a dog park as if my life could be like a movie and meet a cute girl with her dog there.

It is not that I never focus on the present. Sometimes I do. But I've realized that my primary focus most of the time is the future, and a lot of times it detracts from my actual enjoyment of life.

so, im a 13 year old dude, and recently i've been feeling a little down because I feel like i have no passion or excitement in my life. I just moved to orange county and I have no friends here yet, because its the middle of summer and i have little to no social skills. I can't name a hobby of mine. I want to get into skateboarding, but i feel like it will just be another phase. i'm tired of having a passion for a month then just letting it go and moving on. 

I don't know yet, but i think i may have overprotective parents. just the other day I wanted to skateboard to my friends house (the only friend i have in orange county as of now) so we could hang out and i could show him my new longboard. my mom said no. my friends house is a mile away; what? I don't know man. I feel like something is wrong with my life. maybe i'm just not hanging out with people other than my family enough. i want to be away from my family more, too, and spend more time with friends. before i moved, i didn't have any friends, too. **i want to become more independent, is what i'm trying to say i guess.**


also i've been doing a little googling and another result of overprotective parents is the lack of life skills. like public transport, goal setting, time management. I know i'm only 13, but i feel like there should be more excitement in my life, more friends. Every time i want to hang out with my friend, my mom has to plan it like its a vacation. come on. she wont even let me skateboard an empty street without a helmet. even though i can't do any tricks. 

again, im just letting this all out. i know its all jumbled, just bear with me. i appreciate any clarification.",09Aug2017,45
34,"I just made an inappropriate comment on someone's photograph. And it was suggestive of depression and suicidal feelings. And tbh I have been secretly suicidal in my past; but I'm alive so… I guess I'm fine 🙄. But, with this comment it came back again. It's… 

It's not that it went away completely. It was and it is. But I'm not comfortable being a trigger. I'm not ashamed or anything but I was mocked and threatened by a friend. So…

I feel secluded. I want to be able to talk about life from the perspective of 'not a big deal if you want to give it away' sorts. I don't know. If you are able to see through these lines. Please let your opinion reach me.

37,"My dad has been having health issues this past year, so I decided I was going to move closer to him and my mom for support and help around the house on weekends because he can no longer to physical work. I was going to quit next week, everyone knew, my boss knew and all of that good stuff. This week sucked though, I'm having some health issues now and just had enough. Quit the call center on good terms today, no harsh feelings and it feels like a weight lifted off shoulders.

Sure it would have been nice to have another week of pay but customer service is just not my thing. I have a job lined up already, but now I have a week and a half of vacation before I start up again. 

Now the real question is if I should go get some beer to celebrate or not. ",09Aug2017,5

39,I know this may seem so commonplace but I finally got a Work from Home job that pays really well. I just wanted to share my excitement and joy! This also comes after dealing with a lot of stuff emotionally and looking for what felt like eons.,09Aug2017,4
40,"I just feel like putting this out there to people who are not In my life and won't internalize my struggle is the best way to get it out. 

I work for a huge health insurance company (not going to say the name, but almost; fortune 6).  I'm in one of their locations that's in a tiny little population and I got promoted 4 months ago, but am even more unhappy and antsy then I was before the promotion. Till now I have never played the angles by avoiding mandatory overtime, applying for FMLA, getting doctor's notes for every little thing, but I'm thinking of giving up and becoming *that* person. 

To get the *tiniest* thing taken care of for myself (e.g. access to websites needed for a job function, employment verification for rental applications, changing my contact information with the company, getting the a/c turned down from 'surface of pluto' to 'meat locker') I have to submit a ticket through the right website and hope that some person who cares more than I now do receives my request and has the power to help me out. The best of us here are complacent and everyone else is apathetic.

After spending several mornings (weeks) at my desk struggling to get access to another website and crying with frustration, I have decided to surrender. I've never done it before. I've always pushed to do the best job and avoid taking advantage of labor rules. I have wanted to be helpful and useful until now.

I will play the system, plan what I am going to say during my exit interview, and be a useless sack of shit at work until I am able to leave without causing damage in my own life. The funny thing is that I wouldn't be surprised if I got another promotion. 

One more thing I thought I would mention; they have this software called ""OMEGA"" that monitors and categorizes every second. They allot X minutes for each activity. That means that *they* get to decide how much time you need to take a dump, or have to struggle with IT issues. . . They also have software that monitors each key stroke or mouse movement. Again, they decide how much time is acceptable for your mouse to stay still at any given moment, they decide how long it will take you to read and write emails. . .

My only hope is to fight and struggle hard enough to get into a position in life where I'm treated like a valuable **human** investment. Not an expense. I have a plan and will draw on the support of the reddit community to execute it as soon as I am in the position. Thanks for giving me a platform. Even if nobody reads or responds, I already feel so much better.",09Aug2017,1

45,"So I'm 49.  A teacher.  A mom.  No huge issues.  And I feel like I'm such a cliche.  My kids are getting close to leaving the nest and I'm looking at my life differently.  

I am restless.  I want to contribute to the world.  Make a difference.  Be passionate.  Live more out loud.  I want to be that person.  But I don't know how.  

I'm very introverted.  Not very social.  Married to a man who is in a rut of his own.  I am happy.  I'm even happy to be in this time of my life. So it's not like I'm depressed or anything.  

I just want more.  And I don't just not know how to get it.  I honestly can't quite identify the ""more"" I want.

And hopefully in another month I'll be just as scornful of my current efforts! 

For comparison, [my first shitty story](https://www.reddit.com/r/tdmstories/comments/6nslq3/chongeun_the_red/), and [my most recent one](https://www.reddit.com/r/tdmstories/comments/6sms35/the_tragedy_of_andar_the_bright/).

49,"Okay, the beginning ... there is no real beginning just what I remember and it's already getting pretty foggy. So I was watching Luke/myself getting chased by Darth Vader and Palpatine. I didn't really see the latter much, I think when I was hiding I saw him pass by. Darth Vader was for some reason not wearing a mask and he looked like Hercules, the one from the live action tv show. It's still pretty foggy, so I don't really know what he said to me anymore, but I just remember that he spoke to me.

Anyway I fled from him, next time I saw him he was wearing the Suit again. There was like a crossroads and Sheev and him both wen their own ways. I was no tracking Vader from a third person pov and how we went into a very narrow tunnel with a huge double-sided lightsaber. He turned it off.
Anyway I/Luke was just a few meter away and he suddenly popped out at me. He just folded his arms and I was captured like that. Completly bullshit. Anyway now we are at my house. And he is questioning me. He is uncomfortably threating presence. Then he asks me this mathematical/logical riddle, if I say the correct answer, he lets me go. It didn't make a slight bit of sense. It also was like one of those prophecies from Nostradamus. You even have to interpret what the hell your task is. ""2-4 times, not ending in 5, natural numbers untill 20"" I was something like that. A bit more to it.

Anyway I tried thinking about it and it suddenly hit me on how I would go about solving it, but then he said that bunch of Storm Troopers are coming to arrest me at any moment. I tell him that he better save me if I want to tell him the answer of my riddle and I tore up the sheet of paper I used to scribble some ideas on.
We all go with the Storm Troopers, along a path that does not exist in reality the left side of my house. It was very snowy for some reason. Then I started to fall behind and they didn't seem to notice it. I looked back at the house and I saw that the car had its headlights on! I quickly ran over there, the keys were still in. YES! This way my way to escape. I also for some reason brought something with me. I don't remember what, but I put it on the seat besides mine. Anyway just before I wanted to drive away, suddenly a girl is opening my door. I know for a fact it was Darth Vader. She is grinning and asks me to quickly put away whatever I just put on the seat so she can sit down. I do so and I for some reason know that she planned this, left the car lights on to draw my intention and leave the keys in.
I tell her I am very glad that she decided to switch sides. She tells me she better make it worth it. I kissed her multiple times out of happyness of being free. Then I drove a tight curve with the car and we drove away.
The end.",09Aug2017,23
