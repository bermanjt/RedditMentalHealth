2,"One of my coworkers just recently told me he saw me on Tinder, and “swiped right.” He was totally joking around and I was so confused because I don’t have tinder. I’ve never had one, as I’ve been in a relationship for the past four years. My coworker apologized once I explained to him I didn’t have a Tinder and he told me he swiped as a joke to see if I swiped back. He didn’t know I had a boyfriend. He basically told me the person using my photos was also using my name and age as well. I don’t post a lot of photos on social media, and my instagram account is private and I only accept people I’m familiar with. The person using my photos has to be someone I know. I’m super scared and worried that this is going to keep happening and I don’t know what to do. Also there are people getting catfished by this account. I don’t know what to do but I’m super scared.

3,"So, I live in a semi-rural area. I’m also the type of neighbor that will introduce myself to other neighbors to get to know everyone. 
This past April, I did just that. I saw a woman and two kids playing in their backyard, on the property adjacent to mine. So I walked over to say hi, and because I figured my kid and hers might like to play. As I approached, the woman (who was clearly Muslim by her attire) runs inside with the kids. I knock on the door, and a man answers. He explains that his wife is upstairs on the computer taking an online test. The woman who ran in is (supposedly) his SIL, she doesn’t speak English. 
A few days later, they invite us over for dinner. The house is weird, but I figure they just bought it, they’re young, whatever. Weird like dirty and barely furnished. I learn the husband is Egyptian, his SIL is from Saudi Arabia (and nine months pregnant) and his wife, Penny, is Mexican. They are all Muslim, and strictly so. Penny and the SIL wear the headscarves and long black dresses always (forgive me for not knowing the real name). 
Penny and the SIL and our kids hang out on a couple of occasions. I learn that the 18 mo girl is Penny’s, while the 5 and 3yo are the SIL’s kids. 
Over the course of a couple of months, we become friends. Penny is really sweet, and *really* clingy. But I like her. She brings over food a lot, I teach her how to make banana bread. She tells me she and her husband met and married in Mexico. They’re young, maybe mid-20s. But she always seems on edge. Not completely comfortable, you know? She also seemed to always be texting her husband, which led me to believe he was monitoring her, somehow. Initially I wrote it off as her being so religious and more formal in her speech, but something just didn’t sit right. 
She told me she lived in LA for awhile, but is from Mexico. Now, I have had many Mexican and Latino friends, coworkers, neighbors, etc. over the years. The one thing they have in common is a deep connection to their culture and family. She did not. She didn’t have that joyful exuberance I encounter 99.9% of the time with Latina women. It seemed she had no connection to her culture, and she never spoke of family back home or in L.A. It kind of seemed like she was “acting” Muslim. 
Later I learned that the SIL had her baby here, then returned with her kids to Saudi Arabia. Shortly after that, Penny asked me if we could put up one of her friends from Mexico in our camper. A month or so after that, she was gone. I couldn’t text her anymore (even though it was a gmail account I was texting). When I checked with her husband, he said she was visiting family in Mexico. This was three months ago. 
Add to the fact that my area is primarily rednecks and racists, I was really surprised that a Muslim family would choose to live here. 
So I have a bunch of weird shit, a young woman who seems scared/phony, and a really strange living situation. Her husband was always very nice to me, and didn’t set off any alarms. But people can be different behind closed doors. 
My concern is that she was somehow forced into this living arrangement. It just smelled so fishy. And now I’m worried because she is MIA. 
But I have no proof of anything. 
What can I do? Anything? 

Edit: One more weird thing, she texted me regularly, almost every day. But never told me she was leaving town. ",07Nov2017,62
4,"So I've had this problem for a long time, but I do remember being different as a kid. When I was little, we lived hours from our extended family (6 to 10 hours depending on where we were living at the time). I'd stay up all night before we left, too excited to sleep. A few times a year, we would drive up and visit the family for a long weekend, or my parents would leave us for weeks at a time, which, to my knowledge, never bothered us. When it came time to leave, I would sob uncontrollably. I would cry for hours in the car because I wanted to be with my aunts or my grandparents.

Now, I don't feel anything when I leave my extended family. I don't feel anything when I drive away from my hometown. I don't feel anything when I leave my friends for months at a time. I don't feel anything when I drive away from my 3 year boyfriend's house (he now lives 15 hours away). Sometimes my heart gives the tiniest of squeezes when I think about specific moments, but that's it. I don't get heart achey or intense longing feelings for any one. It's just numb, as if I would be fine whether or not they were here.

When I return to the people I care about, I am happy, and all my feelings come rushing back, and I know I love them. This has especially been trying for my relationship with my boyfriend. I've explained my feelings to him, and he is hurt by it, but we both think this is some sort of defense mechanism my brain has developed. Because I don't miss him, sometimes I question whether or not I want this relationship, even knowing that this is how I feel about everybody I care about. But once we are reunited, I want nothing more than him forever.

I have some suspicions, but I would be interested to hear your opinions. Does anybody else feel this way? Are there any suggestions about how to beat this? 

Please help. I would rather feel intense longing than nothing at all. Thank you in advance.",07Nov2017,1

9,"I hate being reviewed for SSI every 6 months. I was officially diagnosed with Major depressive disorder in 2011, and since my mother passed away in my care(2014), I developed PTSD from finding her body and experiencing multiple heart attacks with her, along with her going code blue in the ER during her heart surgery. I had to live in the same house she passed away in until I moved in early 2016.

I was homeless in 2015 for about 6 months. I had to endure and survive in a mens shelter in Brooklyn, NY. I had to avoid drug addicts, mentally unhinged people and having nowhere to go between 9am to 10pm.

I've been on roughly 15 different psych med combinations. Some which make me sleep for 12+hours, made me break out, or just outright sedated me to the point I couldn't accomplish anything during the day.

Move forward to now and my spinal issues are getting worse. I lost 50+ pounds, down to 220, but I am still in a ton of pain. I was diagnosed with radioculopathy, degenerative disk disease and narrowing of my spinal column. Walking is uncomfortable, sitting is uncomfortable and It takes a good hour or more to fall asleep at night because of the chronic back spasms I have.

I now have to deal with SSI reviewing me every 6 months, on top of my phone appointment tomorrow being about something related to the ""state reported wage"" or some shit. I don't remember much about 2015, other than the fact that I had to basically cope with losing a parent alone, with no support, and being homeless on top of that.",07Nov2017,1

11,"I saw a documentary about artists living in a place called Slab City in California which I gather is general peaceful but lawless in the sense that people who chose to live their pay no rent or tax but therefore have no right to civil protections like police etc. 

A woman who was running the Slab City library initially had to weigh up whether she should take a gun or not. She reasoned that there was at least a possibility that at some point an intimidating situation could arise and in that situation it would be preferable if she could defend herself, and as it was  permissable for her to own a gun she took one with her.

And I just thought to myself, America is a massive fuck off place. So many different terrains, climates, etc. If I'm going to go live like an artist in a lawless part of it where conditions in summer can get pretty extreme, and the law states that I can have a gun to protect myself if I'd like, then of course I'm going to bring one with me.

17,"I don't have social media, but I will occasionally make a burner account on Facebook to ""catch up"" on people that are no longer remotely involved in my life. Having graduated from high school 7 years ago and only needing 3 years to graduate college, I've met and left a lot of people behind. 

I was in a brief relationship in high school that may have lasted four months top. It was as deep as a small town high school male wanted it to be: i.e., I was essentially seeking a good time. I was emotionally immature and just wanted sex, but it's not like I ever hurt her more than any other teenage jerk has. 

Anywho, I made a burner account recently and was clicking through accounts and found her! She's since had a kid and lives with her mother still. I saw she posted a throwback post of me on her totally public account, and her mother made a nasty comment about my behavior. Literally 9 years after the fact, damn near a decade. 

It felt good. It reminded me of a great line in Mad Men: I don't think about you at all. I've succeeded so much since living bumblefuck, rust belt, USA, and this girl got knocked up and lives with her mom, and I still am on their mind. She hadn't crossed mine since I left.

There's a teacher at my school that I really connected with. In a lot of ways, he's filled the void of not having a good father that I wasn't even aware was something that was affecting me. 

Although our relationship has only gotten stronger over the years, I'm about to go to college next August and I feel like in a small way this relationship has prevented me from maturing as quickly as most of my friends. 

Most people my age are distancing themselves from their parents but I want the opposite with this teacher. I wish we could do more together and I wish he could be there for everything. I'm probably going across the country and I know most of y'all will say ""I'll be fine"" but I really think I'm gonna miss him so much that I won't be able to do  well in college. This is probably a little unhealthy, but he helps me cope with literally anything; he has a way of saying not much but always really meaningful stuff, and we always hug after discussing any issue I'm encountering and that makes everything a lot better too. It almost makes ME uncomfortable how emotionally dependent I find myself to be with him. Perhaps it's normal and I'm not used to it because of the situation with my biological parents, or maybe it's a little unhealthy. I really don't know. 

I see a therapist by the way, and he's told me he doesn't see anything unhealthy or wrong with the relationship, and that the feelings I have are pretty normal, but I still have my doubts.

29,"People get busy and focused on themselves. I find the internet is a great way to talk to different people from all over and get to know their story. I like to listen, and just see where a person is coming from. I have a group of friends that I talk to daily. We all met on a forum and have been in a group chat for about 3 years. These people know me inside and out. We trust each other, and share almost everything. However as we get older and busy with our jobs people don't post as much as they used to. I barely have anything to add sometimes and I feel like the group is reaching some kind of an end point. That's fine, but I can't help but feel like I'd be extremely lonely without them.

30,"I [20F] commented on a post about this topic a bit ago but I kind of feel like venting about it more. I grew up in a pretty abusive household. If my parents weren’t fighting each other, my dad was abusive towards me. Last summer, my dad and I got in an argument about him and my mom and their constant fighting, and he hit me with a hammer. That changed everything so now he doesn’t live with my mom and I anymore and I rarely see him. I don’t really want to either. This doesn’t mean I only have shitty memories with my dad thought My dad used to often tell me stories about his father, because he died of brain cancer in the 70s so I never got to meet him. I loved hearing these stories. My dad is from Croatia, they moved to Chicago when he was a kid. He has 6 siblings and to this day they all don’t speak to each other. Anyway my dad would tell me these stories about how his father would always take on odd jobs, so they grew up very poor. My dad would tell me that sometimes he’d get really good work and those were his fondest memories of his dad because during those times they would have lobster dinners, and he would buy all the kids presents. This is far from the truth. My older brother recently went on a trip to meet one of our uncles. My brother brought up our uncle and dad’s childhood, the lobster dinners, etc. My brother said our uncle just laughed and told him the truth: their dad was actually a pimp. They basically grew up in a brothel, and were beaten daily. So badly that one time my grandfather threw my dad in the trunk of his car for accidentally breaking the knob off the radio. After hearing this my childhood and all the abuse I endured makes a lot of sense. My dad used to call me a whore and a bitch, so I’d assume everything was just learned behavior. That doesn’t make it okay whatsoever, but now I understand why I dealt with all this. I feel bad that my dad had a shitty childhood, he didn’t deserve it but neither did I. ",07Nov2017,3

32,"Unless I show this to one of my friends so they can read it I doubt anyone I know involved will find this so fuck it, I'm not using a throwaway for this. Half my friends don't use Reddit anyway. I should have picked up on this earlier since I consider myself to be good at reading people but I guess since I considered them a friend I brushed those doubts aside. When I refer to ""them"" or ""they"" I'm referring to the person I'm venting about.

Recently, I found out that someone in my friend group is a genuinely shitty person. From the beginning of my friendship with them, I would catch things in conversation that would be small white lies. Almost like they were trying to impress us. But these things were really easy to fact check. Whether it was them bragging about doing something in a video game or doing something out of the ordinary, most of the things either sounded like they were trying to 1-up me or someone else. All of the video game stuff I've been able to check through play time and none of their stories ever make sense with that amount of play time. I initially brushed it off as just trying to impress their friends because they want us to like them. 

I then started to notice that they didn't actually like me. It wasn't just outright rudeness but it was more of a lack of communication towards me and less enthusiasm to do things with me. I also noticed that they had a habit of cancelling trips to do things if I wanted to join. I'd invite everyone to come over and hang out and they'd still come to my place. It wasn't until today when I found out that they would openly talk about how they don't like me when I wouldn't be there. I know most of my friends would brush it aside and ignore them. It's weird because I've literally never done anything to them for them to dislike me. Their only excuse is that ""our personalities clash"" like what the fuck. If you have a problem with who I am you can literally talk to me about it. 

My biggest fucking problem with this person is how they tried to turn one of my good friends against me. When we were all talking about this person, the one he tried to turn against me told me his story. Apparently they would bitch about things I would do and habits I have. He almost fell for it too until he realized the things they are complaining about are things literally every other human being does. 

Another thing I found out was a big issue was exactly how manipulative they are to their s/o. I feel bad for their s/o because we are all in the same friend group together and we want them out of that relationship. Apparently every time their s/o goes over to their apartment, s/o finds themself feeling miserable afterwards and they don't know why. They both also have gotten into huge arguments in front of the group that makes everything incredibly awkward and the fact that they both are still together afterwards any of those arguments is surprising. They have also lied straight up to someone's face about a conversation they had with their s/o and when that other person confronted s/o about it, they didn't know what they were talking about. I'm worried about the extent they lie to s/o about because I've only heard stories from my other friends. 

I think the next big thing is not how this person is shitty, rather how a lot of my friends haven't noticed that they lie or manipulate their s/o. I can't bring this up to quite a few people due to how close knit people are in this group and the only way I could bring any of this up is if I know someone has a problem with them. That would be hard to see because they have a facade of being the perfect friend they have obviously let slip around a few of us. 

I want this whole thing to end but if one of the few who knows the issues attempts to do something, it'll hurt the group and aside from the one we have a problem with we love everyone else. There's so much more from other perspectives however I needed to get this portion off my chest since I've just learned how shitty this truly is. ",07Nov2017,2
33,"I graduated high school a year early, did a year at my local college, and transferred to Florida State for the shorter summer term. Partied every single day and got an A and a B in my two classes that I took. Since it's the shorter term in the summer you're not really supposed to take more than two. I got pretty homesick and had my first experience with mood swings and drove two hours to go back home about three or four times over the summer.

Fast forward to Fall, my girlfriend of two years from high school cheated and broke up with me and I was and still am pretty sad about that. I thought I would do good in Calc 1 since I am a computer science major and really good at programming and have always been decent at math. I just thought I was going to fit right in. The teacher I'm taking is incredibly hard. She does easy examples and the homework is nothing like the tests. I overheard some girl saying ""I'm happy I have a 64 because I can bring that up to a C and get by this class."" That's how bad this class is. Other kids have B's but I've never taken a calc class and all these other kids took AP Calc and are way better than me and I thought I wasn't that bad. Every week I put about 8+ hours of googling and watching example videos to try to figure out how to do the homework since her lectures are so bad. My parents are paying out of pocket for me to go here and I am doing extremely well in all of my other classes but I could never tell them that I am a few weeks away from failing my first class. I would need to get a C in this class to avoid taking it again but I need a 90 on the next two tests plus the final to get it up that high. I have a test in a few hours that I probably am going to fail too. My first test was in the low 40s and my second one was in the low 30s. I've never felt so overwhelmed by anything and especially not a class. School has always been so easy to me but this feeling of defeat just leads sadness and me pushing away girls that I'm friends with and others that I have sex with sometimes. I'm currently sitting at a 45% in the class. I'm going to try to bring it up to at least a D but I don't even know what to do anymore. I went to tutoring one time and my tutor said he didn't even know how to answer some of them. My TA is a Korean PhD candidate and it is super hard to understand her sometimes and she just doesn't relate to us. She just puts problems on the board and solves them. Last recitation she said she didn't know how to do a problem so she has to email us a TWO PAGE solution of how to do it hours later when she finally figured it out. The problems are insanely long on the tests too and there's so much room for error. I registed for Spring classes and am taking another professor for Calc 1. He has optional homeworks but people say if you do them, the tests are exactly like them so I hope I can do better next semester. I might come for the summer again next year and do Calc 2 then so I can be back where I'm supposed to be with my peers for Fall. I'm still on track for an early graduation since I have gone to college for every single summer semester since I graduated high school. My GPA is going to tank to about a 2.3 if I fail this class and manage to get a B in every other class I'm taking. Right now I have an A in every other class so hopefully, it won't be too bad and I can rally for next semester but I just don't know anymore. At least next semester I can take some more advanced computer science classes which I'm really good at and really interest me and I'll have more knowledge of calc than I did coming into this semester. I've also considered dropping out and trying to pursue something in tech but my parents would never support this idea.",07Nov2017,1

37,"I don’t even know where I am going with this, so bare with me.

I’m not depressed. I have ambitions and am working on two degrees. I have lots of interests. 

I feel like I have trouble being a person. Like everyone else was born with a manual that gave them normal interests and feelings, and I was somehow left out. I don’t like parties. I don’t like social media. I don’t have any romantic interests. It actually makes me feel guilty when people ask me out, like I should say yes but I just have no fucking interest. It’s very hard for me to connect with people. I connect much more with movies and facts than anything in the real world. 

It could be that for the most part people don’t really interest me. I actually sort of suspect I am autistic or something.

I don’t actually feel like a real person. I kind of feel like everyone else is on a completely different wavelength or something. I also don’t think I have a personality. Most of my thoughts are only shaped by a framework, and I usually think of things in relation to a movie or character - i.e.) This would make a good scene in a Fincher movie, this is very Guillermo del Toro, how would David Foster Wallace write about this? I don’t really have strong opinions that are my own. I think it’s that I assign people in the real world the same level of importance as fiction. They hold same value in my mind. 

I learned to be semi-normal when talking to people, what topics to avoid and basic small talk. I learned how to be more social. I learned that people don’t like it when I am reclusive and that I should smile more. I care much less now that I am in college and able to focus on my interests without the pressure of constant socialization. 

Still, I have never been normal and, although I can try and say that it doesn’t bother me, it always will at some level. I always end up feeling like the odd one out.

It goes away for a while but then it comes back worse. I want to take him to the vet again but I don't have any money at the moment. His other ear is affected too. 

Has any other cat owner dealt with something similar?

39,"Late night post but I can't sleep and I have class in a few hours, so I guess I'm gonna stay up. 

Before, it never really dawned on me how much I enjoyed spending time with my young cousins, my young nieces and nephews. For reference, I'm a 20 year old college student who's struggled with depression for a long time, and has just recently sought help. My aunt has a pair of twins, recently turned 8, a boy and a girl, who I've spend a good deal of time with. We all know kids have their drawbacks, obviously, but I'm not going to delve into that. 

I love the fact that just by conversing and playing with my cousins they'll revere me as some sort of hero. I love that just by indulging my 8 year old cousins imagination for an hour or so, that it could mean so much to her and maybe be a memory that could be long lasting. It seems greedy, and selfish, but inherently I don't think there is wrong with it. I love the feeling I get, a feeling of importance, just for a bit, fleeting. I struggling a long time with a feeling of unimportance and thinking that I would never matter, but recently I've come to embrace that same feeling. I don't want to matter, honestly. I don't want to be important, in a grand sense. I just want to create lasting memories with a few close friends and family, I want to love and be loved by just a few people. 
I hope a few people read this and enjoy it, maybe it'll help a few people, maybe it'll get lost in the early morning turmoil. I think maybe if we all realized we aren't as important as we think, the world could be a great place again. If you're reading this; I'm glad you exist, and I hope you have a great day. If you're struggling with anything feel free to pm me, I'll be around to listen. ",07Nov2017,1
40,"I called my father as I do every week. I live in central-eastern France, he lives in Normandy, as well as most of my relatives. That's a 700 km (435 mi) distance, so we don't often see each other. We've had a complicated relation when I was younger and I left home when I was 19. Since then, we are more patient and comprehensive to each other. But we never managed to say our feelings. He never said he loves me or whatever, and I've always thought he actually doesn't. When I was younger, he hardly had any consideration for my feelings, as far as I remember. It may have changed when my mother died 7 years ago.

A couple years ago, I started to feel he is somehow attached to me. He would not speak his mind about it, but his attitude lead me to think that. Several months ago, when he picked me up at the airport, I was willing to tell him my feelings. But I couldn't. During the summer, I flew to Normandy a couple week-ends, but he was barely present. I would see him just a few hours. He was always with his girlfriend. 

I called my father last week. We talked about stuff, and at some point, he asked me what I'd like for Christmas. I had no idea what to say, I actually don't want anything. Well, what came to my mind is ""nothing... but love and consideration"" but I just couldn't speak these words. I didn't know how my father would react to that, we just never say this kind of words. I only managed to say ""no idea"".

I've had hard times recently, and this is actually how I feel. I only have a friend here, and I have little conversation with my colleagues at work. I've oversensitive and it can't be helped. When I'll visit my father in 10 days, maybe I'll be able to speak my mind, with your help.",07Nov2017,1

It reminds me of a girl in high school whose butt I would lick when we’d have sex.

One day, a few years ago, I bought some gruyère and let it come up to room temperature so the flavor and smell would ripen.

43,"I ""had"" a friend from way back childhood. To be honest all we did was talking couple of times, then me and my family moved out, I was 12 then and had crush on her she was 13. After a long time, past summer she texted me because she was willing to be part of a culture, dance and art festival that's been happening in my city. She says she wanna be part of it and she says she heard that I've been in that festival as guide, maybe I can help her to get in as a guide too.
Long story short, I set everything we met just once my old feeling had a spark but she told me even in the first meeting that she had a boyfriend but was in work and travel program those days. Days go by festival starts she's guide of kids I was guide of a dancer group who came from Mexico, we were rarely seeing each other due the bussy program of mine. One night she goes ""look there's the thing​, I don't wanna ruin anything but."" She has stopped talking for few seconds then said ""nevermind"" I insisted her to keep going and she finally goes ""I don't wanna ruin anything but all those people who see us together asks if we're together, and you keep telling me you've missed me whenever you see me."" I told her that I have crush on her she cries she says she has a boyfriend which is ""loyal"".
I said then nothing to talk about, since I'm not gonna pretend like nothing happened, I don't wanna see you, because I'll not tame my feeling if it's not working out for us, which I knew it'd not, that's that.'
Festival goes by, she finds me tries to talk even tho I didn't want. last night of the festival there's a huge party for all artists like 800 people, + 40 guide. We went to the small bridge over a lake and sat down cuddled and told her this will be our last night. After couple of hours I left her behind crying, then I felt bad and called a cab for her.  And I went back to party. 
When the festival has ended she contacted me again and told she'll leave in couple of days I agreed to meet since she said she has things so say to me. And one innocent meeting she goes ""You , me, my bff, sister can throw a booze night in my place, since I have couple of days left to go my home."" I agreed because I thought we couldn't do anything, there was her sister and bff which they knew she had boyfriend over a year. 
Later that night we both went really drunk, I said I wanna sleep but everybody stood up with me, there were place for 4 person in living room and 2 in bedroom. I thought I'd sleep in living room, but she took me to bedroom.  Which her sister and bff could think what's gonna happen. That night, because I'm a douchebag because she's not that loyal we've been together, her boyfriend was sending messages, it was like 8am in usa, he was saying that he missed her, but she just took a look at the screen then continued. I felt happy that night, but then I realized, it's both fucked up situation. İf we've risked all and started a relationship how could I trust her? And on the other hand we couldn't continue​ like that. I've prepared a good breakfast for everyone in the home. Then told her that this was really it. We shouldn't see each other before anything goes really fucked up. 
I haven't seen her since then and since then I can't trust any girl. ",07Nov2017,1

A year ago while do nothing meditation (around 4hours), i used to feel a bliss that would last a day and a half or less, not sure why, but ever since trying to do it since I've gotten tinnitus, I just can't seem to ever reach that blissful state

All i hear is a whiny ego, all i hear is an unsatisfied human being.

Since my life is an illusion why does it matter that the human being thinks? I am humaning yet i don't even know what emotion is supposed to be legit or what isn't

I can choose as the awareness but yet, why does the duality of the programs around me seem so hostile? Even when I'm genuinely not trying to harm anyone, I get hostiles around.

When i try to stay my purest i get used. Why is life unfair? I just don't get it.

I thought i had a lead to cure my disease, even that lead and hope i put on a pedestal decided to just leave me within a day, telling me i don't care, If i could share history and show how much care i have i would, but just talking about what past was isn't going to make anything change. What is there left to do, just walk the road as lonely as it used to be. It's always me playing with myself anyway, Why have i created such a dumb game? And why do i feel so sad when playing with myself. And why can't i even breath well, while trying to fall asleep, it's like somethings strangling me not allowing me to breath. I just feel confused and loopy as usual.

55,"I’m not a religious person. I grew up in a religious household. I grew up praying to a god I no longer believe in. But here’s the thing – anyone who *truly* identified as religious will tell you that although prayer seems kind of silly, there’s something valuable about it.


So what is prayer, really? Let’s assume for the sake of argument that god does not exist, and, by extension, prayer is not communication with some “greater power”. Neither of those things need to be true to acknowledge that prayer is still a conscious act and a psychological phenomenon. So if it’s not communication with some god out there in the universe, what is prayer doing?


I believe that many people, myself included for many years of my life, mistake what they’re feeling when they have this sensation communion with god. When you meditate or pray or have some revelation about an idea, there *is* a physical and psychological sensation that washes over you. It’s real. It’s not imagined. It’s not some supernatural connection, but it’s a real psychological phenomenon. It happens when we sit, reflect, pay attention to what’s happening in our own minds and in our general experience. 


We’re facing this problem of terrorism as a society, and we don’t really know what to do about it. New technology has made us exponentially more efficient at nearly everything – including killing each other. If everyone with access to basic machinery or weaponry has the potential to kill a significant number of people, we need change at the level of the individual. We need to find a way to instill in people the values of empathy, respect for life, and a feeling of one-ness. Both religions and sciences bring us to this realization that as much as we feel like discrete individuals, we are not so different or separate from one another.


If “thoughts and prayers” means nothing more than pausing to think about a tragedy – to internalize what happened, empathize with those who are feeling extreme physical and emotional pain, and to put a message out into the world that says “We noticed what happened, and we feel some of your pain, however insignificant” – I think that’s worthwhile and something to be encouraged.


You don’t need to believe in god or prayer to believe in the value of self-reflection.

57,"Me and my best friend used to work together (we're both women) and we had a shared male coworker/friend, Tim. He was a very awkward person at first, but his deadpan jokes won us over and we all became good friends. We started seeing movies together every week as a tradition, going out for each others' birthdays, just generally hanging out on the regular... We joked around at work constantly and even started a group chat for memes and making plans which I titled ""Workaholics.""

Then Tim transferred stores, which wasn't a big deal, we still planned on seeing him. After he transferred, we had plans to go to a concert together downtown. My best friend and I are both huge paranormal buffs, so we took the opportunity to book a hotel that was reportedly haunted the night of the concert for the three of us.

Before the concert my best friend and I had been drinking in the hotel, but just a beer and a couple shots. Tim arrived and we drank a little bit more, but also got Chipotle so we were not on empty stomachs for the rest of the night. We went to the show, found a spot, and Tim went to get us all beers. We drank the beers, the show was fine. Before the encore, Tim wanted to leave the show and go to this after hours gay club, Berlin, my best friend and I liked to frequent. We get to the club, are there for just enough time for me to go to the bathroom and for Tim to start throwing up. Out of nowhere Tim was totally wasted, I had never seen him like that before. My best friend and I literally had to carry him to our room and tuck him into bed. 

My best friend and I stayed up, and left Tim in bed with a note to text us if he needed anything because we were ghost hunting (no, seriously lol). We came back to the room and passed out like nothing.... Then the morning came. My best friend and I both were woken up by a clusterfuck of headaches like we've never ever felt before. Believe me, we have both done our fair share of drinking and over-drinking, and getting sick as a result... But this felt different, like my brain was trying to grow three sizes in my head and crack my skull. My best friend's head hurt so much she got up at 7 am to walk to a convenient store to buy excedrin.

She and I had been planning on taking the L back to her house just outside the city, but we felt so terrible there was no way we could survive public transportation. Tim had driven and met us there, so on our way out of the hotel I asked Tim, to me rhetorically, if he could drive us back. There was the longest pause.... And then he seemingly begrudgingly agreed.

After the show we seemed to see less and less of Tim. He was in school when we had all worked together, but now any time we asked him to hang out he was busy with school or just wouldn't answer. We were of course understanding of prioritizing school, so we told him to just let us know when he was free so we could see a movie or just hang out. He stopped participating in our group chat, responding to individual texts at all, he just started to ghost.

Christmas time rolled around, and my best friend and I decided to go in on a nice gift for Tim, because he seemed down and we wanted to cheer him up. He's a fitness buff and was going to school for physical training, so we got him a fit bit. We gave him the gift the night of an art show I had which I got him to attend. After that night, we have seen him twice. Both for a movie, and the last time was 6 months ago because my best friend was fired from our old company and he heard the news.

My best friend and I pondered why he would just stop hanging out with us.. we thought we all had a good time whenever hanging out, we thought he liked us... We truly considered him a friend, and we thought he felt the same about us, but everything seemed to change in an instance and we didn't know why.

It wasn't until it had been 2 years after the concert that her and I started talking about that night/morning. She and I are no strangers to recreational drugs, and the more we talked about it our massive headache/hangover felt more drug related. We've gone over the events of that night over and over again, and nothing seems awry until we get to the part where Tim grabs us beers at the show. Time and time again, we come to the conclusion he must have drugged us but underestimated our bodies' abilities to handle recreational drugs.

We don't see him anymore, so we think maybe this has something to do with it... Maybe guilt, maybe fear that we know.... He was a very private person, so we didn't know very much about him or his life at all. I've tried to do as much Google snooping as I can, and I've found through one of those people search engines that he has a criminal record, but I'm too cheap to pay $30 to find out why he was arrested..... I know this was a long ride, but this question is one that gnaws at the back of my brain, wondering if our suspicions are true and if anything happened while my best friend and I were passed out. Statistically, when a women is drugged and raped it is often times a friend she trusts, and the opportunity was laid out so neatly for him. Sometimes I'll think, ""nooo.. Tim wouldn't do that to us.."" but then I realize we didn't really know him at all.",07Nov2017,1
