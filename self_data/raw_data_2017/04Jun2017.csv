3,"Most of my academic effort has been based on the idea that everyone has about equal intelligence, and that my performance is mainly a function of how hard I work. However, people I work closely with often suggest that they work just as hard as I do, yet end up with worse results. I used to be skeptical of them, but after living with roommates and seeing how they just don't ""get"" concepts the way I expect them to, I'm starting to wonder if I do have some kind of ""genetic"" advantage.

But if that were the case - if I were privileged with a stronger ability to pick up on new information - what would be the point of working hard towards academic achievement? Why put effort into studying if your results are just a measurement of your genetics? Good grades wouldn't be something to be proud of, they'd just reflect your luck at birth.

I tend to think of myself as someone who aims to work hard. I feel if I were to think of myself as ""naturally smart"", then I would become lazy fairly quickly. I have seen this happen very often, both in real life and on Reddit. Those who think of themselves as ""naturally smart"" seem to fall into the trap of thinking they have more potential than others, and thus can delay effort until it is absolutely necessary.

I spend a lot of my time studying. For a good chunk of my life, I haven't done much else, so naturally I saw my academic achievement as the result of hard work. But now, in college, I'm surrounded by people who work as hard as I do, yet still do worse and even fail. It seems unfair that I am spared from this distress for no apparent reason. And part of me wonders if I've never experienced ""true"" struggle like my friends have. (To make things worse, my friends actually *do* suggest that I haven't experienced ""true"" struggle like they have, due to being more ""naturally intelligent"".)

So my question is, if most of my achievement is actually a result of my genetics rather than hard work, what would that *mean* for how I should view achievement in general? Because if that were the case, academic honors would be kind of pointless. It would mean they're just medals for being born with favorable traits, which honestly makes them pretty worthless in my view. Why strive for academic achievement at all?",04Jun2017,3
5,"My boyfriend's brother just moved into our house recently. I didn't consent to this arrangement. I know my boyfriend had been asking  him to move to the city we live for a better life and promised him that he could stay with us. I bought the place myself  and wasn't informed at all until the day he moved in. He has no money at all. I am pregnant at the moment and just want to save some money for the baby. Don't think it is a good timing to have an extra person in the house. My boyfriend said that his brother will pay us as soon as he starts working. I told my boyfriend that I don't want extra responsibilities and don't wanna cook for him as well. He said that's okay. I was making breakfast this morning and seriously I just wanted to cook some bacon and egg for myself and my boyfriend. My boyfriend started asking me to make more for his brother , I said I don't want to and I am hungry. He can make his own if he wants to eat. But he kept asking me to make extra eggs and mushroom. I felt really annoyed. So I left the kitchen. He offered the food to his brother. Afterwards, when I was out in the living room and didn't hear his brother saying hello to me and my boyfriend accused me for being rude. I feel really upset now, so everything is my fault???I am being a selfish person that wouldn't even let his brother stay. He did make more food for me after but just left on the beach without covering it and told me if I don't wanna have it now, I should put it in the fridge. The food needs to go in the bin now as I saw the flies landed on it. It is the afternoon now and I haven't been able to eat anything for the day. I feel really really upset now. ",04Jun2017,51
7,"Hey Ill try to keep things concise, I hope to read some comments!

*im still writing this and its kindaaa long. I still hope somebody reads though, cheers :)

INFO

I kind of needed a job over the summer to help pay for school, and I got a bit lucky through a connection through my moms hair stylists friend or something. I called up a number and I started the next day.

Basically its a sales job at the local flea market. I was told it is paid hourly ($12 cad an hour) which to me is fine because I would be perfectly ok at working for min wage (something like 11.25 or 11.75). There is also commission. 

Soo basically I stand at this little booth, there are well over 400 booths at the market so its a large area. Each booth is about idk 5 steps wide by 5 steps so you can get an idea of the size

I stand here while people walk by and try to get their attention  with some fliers, then tell them about the info then try to make a sale.

Im an introvert, but as i've grown up (turning 19 soon) I dont really care much about talking to people. I've never had any social anxiety, but for example if I have family over, I prefer just hang out with my 2 yr younger brother, and my 4 yr younger cousin, rather than talk to any uncles and aunts. (Sidenote my dads side of the family are all extremely cool and attractive people, its kind of neat). What im trying to say is, I prefer to not talk to people, but I have no problems doing it if I need to for whatever reason

WHAT ARE YOU SELLING 

soo im selling android tv boxes which is honestly a good product. That being said, if you got one off amazon for 80 bucks I would be suprised if there was a single fucking difference between that and the $300 we sell. So right off the bat I feel like im just scamming people left and right, but the products sold at our booth ARE actually cheaper than you can get from major retailers (staples, wallmart), so I guess its not the worst price in the world.

I kind of hate it because I fucking hate retail management man... so fucking much..

I can literally already see this happening soon: ""Hey, I noticed you haven't been making a good amount of sales... ..."" and then something how I need to make more or I get fired. 

That being said idrk if that is all that likely.. even during my first day I already made a sale (like 4 were made when I was there), and I had 2 people who I got prettty close to buying. So it isn't really that difficult. Also, there are actually a looot of people who come by. At some points all 5 ppl would be talking to a different customer

It would go against myself to fucking lie and push people to buy the more expensive model (they are all the fucking same with an 80 buck difference), but I can literally hear the manager telling people that ""ohhhh you neeeed the newest version"", or when ppl walking by say they already have android tv she'll say ""oh but you dont have ours! ours is better!"". (that being said this has actually worked.. hmm, but when it doesn't it just comes off as onnoxious as fuk)

So there were 3 other coworkers + the owner today so 5 ppl in this small booth. 

Guy 1: lead sales, skinny white kid. He has been working there the longest and my thoughts are as follows. He looks like a loser. Not as in ugly or nerdy, I just don't like him. He told me in a non-mean non-nice way, ""you are like walking ambien"", and to ""hold the information book up higher when talking to people""

okay.. buddy. I know how I talk and I fucking listen to you talk. I may have a kind of dull lackluster sounding voice when talking to people.. but im genuine and natural. I've had a newspaper route where I personally collected an optional payment, so I have talked to customers before. I will be polite and say ""hows it going"" to people walking by, but im not going to try to stand in front of them or some stupid shit to try and stop them.

 And telling me to hold the book higher!?!?!?!?!?... thanks I didn't actually realise I was doing that, but maybe say it in a more polite way I guess.

The booth owner also told me to be more charismatic, said ""smiling is free"", but in a 'you need to smile more so I can make more money' kind of way. I dont have any grudge or anything but telling me what to do is kind of irritating. 

The other two coworkers started later, first brown guy was nice and genuine, I like him. The second seemed boring, and I don't really care either way.

Another note, the white coworker guy had the weirdest handshake ive ever had... his wrist cracked when I tried to shake it. And when I shook the nice brown guys hand it was like he was COMPLETELY limp. odd.

I can't pinpoint why I really dont want to go back in tomorrow after working once. Most likely is that I have the owner watching and judging me 24/7, and telling me what to do. fuck

8,"I'm 22 and as the title says I have no experience at all with the opposite sex. If I ever have sex at all in my life, it will probably have to be with a prostitute. I wasted my youth playing video games, hanging out with my male friends, and just mostly staying away from girls because I was too nervous. At this point, it's not normal for me to be a virgin at this age. I can't see any girl being ok with my situation at my age. It's not ideal but it is what it is, I can't go back and change the past. I'm not objectively good looking and very shy, honestly the only way I can see myself having sex any time soon is if it's with a hooker. It sucks but I have no one to blame but myself. I try to do the best I can with what I have, I'm trying to dress decently plus I go to the gym every day and lift weights, but you can't polish a turd I guess. Anyways, my life is fine in the most parts, I get good grades and I am mostly on a good track in life, but my lack of a sex life has been annoying. For the most part, I don't care because I don't want to get married or have kids. I just wish I could make imy sex drive go away, it's done no good for me at all.

11,"And it was all my fault.

He was asleep beside me when I touched him. I wasn’t thinking, only acting on urges and desires of something that could never happen. Now he’s afraid of me, afraid to sleep, afraid to even talk to me. What’s worse was that I kept calling him, I kept texting him, I even showed up at his work begging for answers as if I didn’t do anything wrong in the first place, as if I was the victim. No. He was hurt. 

And it was all my fault.

Two weeks after, I get a call. From him. He threatened to press charges and get a restraining order on me if I ever saw him again, and two of my other friends stopped talking to me in solidarity. That was the last time I heard his voice. Just like that, no more hangouts after class. No more late nights of Monster Energy and Monster Hunter. No more laughs or jokes. No more companionship. No more friendship. No more life. They’re gone.

And it was all my fault.

The shitty part about all this? They were my only friends. I never talked to anybody, looked at anybody, let alone made friends with anybody. Somehow my former friends saw something special in me to take me under their wing and tolerate my shittiness. For once in my life I had friends, but  I had to fuck it up and throw it all away. I wish every day I could go back and fix what I’ve done. Wishing, though, is childish. I have given up. I am destined to be alone. I will never have friends again. I must accept that friends and fun and happiness are things I don’t get to enjoy as the others do. I am a broken, worthless person. I will be alone forever.

One of the worst parts of ""old media"" was the fact that a few large corporations were able to control EVERYTHING. Nearly everything fell under the banner of Disney or some other large entity. I saw new media as the people taking back their media. We were now in control. We weren't under the thumb of the giant conglomerates, and we could truly be our own. Those hopes are now gone. The large corporations will forever control the way we enjoy ourselves. Rooster teeth is controlled by a large corporation, Machinima was recently bought out, Group Nine controlled SourceFed, Maker studios controls thousands of influencers and was bought out by Disney. Discovery owns large swatch of media holdings. Smosh and The Warp Zone were also bought out.

22,"Necessary background information:

My dad died. Suddenly, of a heart attack, on Christmas. This last Christmas. It was fucked up. But with time, I've come to be somewhat alright with it. Shit happens, to good people. He was a good dude. And shit happens. Also, I'm not religous and neither is my family.

Also, my gfs friends are somewhat religious.

Situation:

Recently, me, gf, and gfs friend (GFF) and her husband met up for a night out. Upon meeting, the first thing GFF said was ""We have been praying for you every night. You have been in our thoughts. We have prayed for you and your family."" That's not an exaggeration. They said they prayed for me/my family repeatedly, and regularly.

Which is kind of a nice thing to say. Other than the fact that she made no effort to reach out to the people who are still living. Motherfucker, I'm still here. I have a cell phone. I have FB and social media. If you actually gave a shit, it would have taken you one minute to reach out and say ""hey senkichi. your situation sucks ass. Sorry about that."" And if you didnt give a shit, dont bring up my goddamn dad's death the second I see you for the first time in months. I don't need to think about that while we drink craft beer and play jenga. I'll think about that some other time, devoid of religion and platitudes.

Its not like were great friends. I don't expect them to reach out, or actually do anything about the situation. It just feels so disingenuous to express caring without actually making an effort to care. Your prayers were with me? Motherfucker, if they were they arrived way too late.

27,"A thug uses violence in aspiration of secular gain: money, power, goods. He/she wants to live, enjoy life. 

The Jihadist uses violence in aspiration of getting pampered by 72 virgin boys in Heaven. He wants to die, 'go home to the Big Sugar-Daddy in the Sky'. 

I.e.: 

The thug lapses back into a predatory animal mode: egoistically pursuing its own / its pack's survival and thriving, ruthlessly taking whatever it gets its claws on. 

The Jihadist, however, falls below that. He does not kill for survival or thriving. He does not even have that excuse. No: the Jihadist kills because he's adhering to a nihilist death cult. Basically, the Jihadist is a spiritual zombie. 

Make no mistake: thugs being a reality is bad enough. But having to deal with what are essentially a form of zombie collective on top -- that's quite an other quality of nuisance. 

* While the thug might be betraying a more civilized society, the Jihadist betrays mankind as a whole. 

Trivializing Jihadists as ""a bunch of thugs"" is of course an attempt to blur their connection to Islam. It certainly takes a stunning degree of carelessness to believe one could afford such a generous miscategorization. 

This is not just some superficial distinction. On a very real and practical level, it's the difference between facing an enemy who loves life and fears death, and one that doesn't. 

With the first, there is negotiation, there may even be reasoning and mercy. 

With the latter, there's no basis left for either.

35,"There's this girl he's been interested in, she saw a picture of me and asked who it was.  When she found out he knew me she straight up asked him to try and arrange something so she could meet and have sex with me.  However he told her that he wouldn't talk to me about it unless she would let him have sex with her too.  They argued about it for a while and then she agreed that she would let him have sex with her if I was there too.  So basically, she will only have sex with him if I'm there and it's a threesome.

Of course I didn't find out about any of this as it was playing out.  I just got a phone call from my friend one day and he told me all this and I thought it was a prank.  I said no and then he kept bothering me during that phone call, I kept saying no.  It's been like a month, and there's downtime of a day here and there but I get voicemails, Facebook messages, text messages and emails from him basically begging me to reconsider because she isn't going to sleep with him unless I show up to have sex with her, and ""I'd do it for you man"" and all this stuff.  If I respond to anything he says, then he starts sending me a ton of messages because he knows I'm there.  If I don't respond that's when he starts sending me messages through other means, because he thinks I'm not getting the message or something.  I've seen him when with other friends and he doesn't bring it up unless we're alone, so I try not to be alone with him, because he gets genuinely pissed when he realizes I'm still not going to do it.  He's sent me screengrabs of messages the girl has sent him through Facebook so I know this is 100% real (not that I doubted it after he started pushing so hard anyway), and he's tried showing text messages when I see him in person but I don't look because I'm really trying not to encourage this.

On the other hand I have considered just doing it to get him off my back.  It isn't like she's unattractive or anything, she is good looking, but at the same time I know if I do this just to shake him this one time then it's going to set a precedent I'm not interested in keeping up.  Or even a reputation I want sticking with me if he goes around telling people I helped him get with a girl he liked by agreeing to a threesome because that was the only way she would do it.

I also have her info obviously sent he's shown me the messages, I still don't think she knows how to get in touch with me, so if I really wanted to I could just go behind his back, send her message, set something up to have sex with her and then maybe she tells him she isn't interested in him anymore and that puts this on mute as well.  Or maybe she tells him she had sex with me and then he's pissed at me but if he stopped talking to me at this point that wouldn't be such a bad thing either.

Deceptively appearing rectified, perched atop an ivory monument to the self, a scoffer surveys the serpentine causeway winding atop a lake of liquefied will, upon which the desperate hordes seek futile escape from one end of hell to the other. Each sees his own path alone, eyes magnetically drawn towards the center, only intensifying the orbiting speed with which they hurtle toward destruction.

Scoffer, ceasing, sighs and starts off weeping. ""No more!"" he cries, ""No more!"" The heights of hell none to compare with the deepest vale of heaven, attempt at elevation deepens recognition of disparity. As the ivory tower sinks into the depths, a sordid equality is re-established. 

A created wasteland, a foreshadowing of a worse-yet fate to come. We create what we are becoming. A skull and bones tattooed across the chest, the stupidity of pride.
