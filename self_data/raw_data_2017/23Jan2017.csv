1,"Hello
I have planned a holiday to Belgium in a few weeks but am a bit unsure with what I can and can't take. I know I can take a 23kg suitcase in the hold and a small one on the plane with me but I am unsure of what I can take with me. I really need advice on what I can take with me and what I will need to declare either in England or Belgium.
My personal phone and work phone and my 2 phone chargers.
My laptop and laptop charger.
My Xbox one and my PS Vita. 
My 2 Vapes, few tanks and 14 bottles of juice.
Around 15-20 DVDs.
Alcohol I can take (cactus jack/sours)
Deodorant and aftershave.
Any help on these items that I can take with me and how I go about it is appreciated. It is my first time flying and I am staying roughly 4 weeks with a friend, bit worried that I won't be able to take some things and also a bit worried about flying.",23Jan2017,1
2,"It’s interesting to see the variety of opinions people have about Trump. Perhaps more than any other individual in recent memory what Trump represents seems to change depending on who you ask and what their agenda is. If you ask someone who is more liberal they’ll probably claim he is a racist/misogynist/sex-offender whereas if you speak to more conservative folks they might praise how he speaks his mind and wants to grow the economy. However, I believe that in reality Trump is none of these things - he’s merely an opportunist who wants to gain power, influence and (perhaps) move the country in a direction he believes is right. He recognized the growing discord between Americans and capitalized on it. He recognized that a large portion of Americans feel like they have been left behind - that their jobs and way of life have been taken away. 

Now, I’m also highly skeptical as to whether Trump can fix any of the problems or truly help the middle class. But, what I do know is that this divide between Americans is a serious issue and that would still be true even if the election had turned out differently. In fact, one could argue that the silver lining in Trump’s victory is that it helped to shed light on just how divided the country really is and how many people still remain in their own little bubble.  

I’ve seen many ridiculous articles about racist acts inspired by Trump cropping up on social media lately. While I think it’s unfortunate that Trump has been used as rallying point for legitimate racists such as the KKK the truth is, again, that they are merely using a few snippets that Trump has said to push their own agenda. Racist individuals are racist because of deep-rooted societal perceptions or negative experiences with certain groups - not because of some third grade level speech given by a 70 year old man. Just check out this [picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cw2S6h8XUAY4k1C.jpg) someone on my Facebook shared recently. Really? You don’t think it’s possible your neighbor just had some racism issues ALL along? It just goes back to what I was saying - Trump is merely a manifestation of a much larger issue that has been brewing for some time. Instead of directing our effort towards decrying Trump we should try to educate legitimately racist people on different cultures instead of sweeping the problem under the rug.

All that being said, how should we move forward? As Obama said ""*If you’re tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try to talk with one in real life*"". We need to realize that despite our differences we all have the same goal of creating a peaceful nation where everyone has the means to succeed. Our survival as a society is predicated on the fact that our similarities outweigh our differences and, as cheesy as it sounds, that we can all get along. 

Nonetheless, I have to say that I’m disappointed. I live in one of the most liberal cities in the country and it’s disheartening to hear many co-workers express (slightly humorous?) regret that Trump was not assassinated. Seriously? The man has not even been in office for a week and you are already hoping he’s murdered in cold blood? I think we need to be more optimistic about the future and deal with challenges as they come.

Ultimately, I wrote all of this to hopefully inspire a message of healing. Let’s do our best to listen to each other, not jump to hasty conclusions and remember that in the end the best thing is for everyone to move forward together or risk our country falling apart.

8,"So I had a thing for this girl for months on end. I bottled it up and up, and a lot of the time she was all I thought about. We messaged each other almost all day everyday, and I was happy enough to just keep going like this and not making a move. A girl was interested enough to want to talk to me on a regular basis for once, and I suppose in my head somewhere I believed if I didn't ask her out I could just keep on going on deluding myself into thinking I had a chance. I'm sure a little bit of flirting was there, but it was pretty innocent in hindsight, and I took it to mean more than it actually did. She clearly showed interest for other guys and very little romantically in me.

Eventually I got sick of the horrible feeling of not knowing whether we had a chance, and I took the plunge. I told her how I feel. I just told her I like her a lot and that I was sorry if it made things awkward or weird. She told me that it's fine, and that in all honesty a friend had told her how I feel at a party a few months back, but she just wasn't sure if I still felt that way. She didn't bring up how she felt, which I took as her not wanting to hurt my feelings by telling me she doesn't feel the same. We just kinda weirdly laughed it off.

I decided not to message her to give her space, but after a while I decided just to not talk to her unless she initiated it to give myself space to get over it. It was so damn hard, but day by day it got easier, and I'm pretty much over her. I've seen her when I've been out at clubs a couple of times, and in my slightly drunk state the feelings kinda surface again. The first time if was a week after I had told her how I feel, and I just apologised again to her for making things awkward. She just said 'I don't think it's awkward, it's honestly fine!' I told her I don't want to take up her night, and that I'd talk to her about it all some other time. When I went to walk away she gave me a hug, which seemed to have a kind of finality to it if you get me. Next time I saw her we just made eye contact and gave each other a little smile and nod. That same night I saw her flirting hard with another guy and had to stand outside with a friend, cause it hurt like fuck. But apart from those times, I'm over it. I don't even think about her that much, and it's been quite a while since we saw each other.

Anyway, we're gonna be at a mutual friend's party in a pretty confined space this weekend. It's pretty much inevitable that we're gonna bump into each other. Even though I'm over it now, I'm kinda fed up of that air of weird awkwardness whenever we are around each other. Maybe it is only on my end, since she said she doesn't feel awkward, but I don't think so. It's pretty obvious we both feel weird about the whole thing and don't know how to behave. I kinda want to clear the air and at least be friends again, cause she is a genuinely lovely girl. Hell, God knows I could use a wing woman. Even if that's a pipe dream, how do I at least survive being around her without dying of awkwardness?",23Jan2017,1

15,"So...long story short...in August 2016 I began college 7 hours from home and the whole semester I was planning on coming back home because I didn't like being so far away and stuff. So we packed up at semester for Xmas break and I moved back home, ready to go to college there. But during Xmas break I decided I missed my old college and wanted to go back, so I did. And I just got here today, 7 hours from home. And I think I might have made a mistake. Again. I forgot about all the things that made me want to leave in the first place, and when I got back home only missed the memories and happy times I had, instead of all the things I hated. So yea, I'm sitting here in my dorm room questioning whether or not coming back was right for me. I miss home, I miss my family, I miss everything. And that's what made me leave in the first place. It just feels like there's nowhere I belong. Any advice on what to do? Cause I just feel so indecisive and stuck about everything. Thanks :)",23Jan2017,1
16,"I really really do. I still love you, I'm not sure I ever won't. You are still family in my mind. I hope you always will be. But I will never be with you again. It's been over a year that it ended. I think of you often and I imagine you think of me too. I hope you've found the help you needed. I hope you've worked on your depression and anxiety. I hope you are learning to love yourself. I remember saying to you that I wish you could see yourself the way I saw you. 

I know things ended because they had to. And I do my best to look at that relationship not as a failure but as a lesson. As an experience. I learned so much from it. I came out stronger than ever.

I want someone who loves themselves so that they can love me too. I honestly believe if you don't have love for yourself you cannot be a part of a healthy loving relationship. 

I reread our last emails recently. It broke my heart to read those words again. To finally have you acknowledge that you really did push me away and hide behind your addictions to weed and video games. I wanted to scream ""I TOLD YOU SO"" but more than that I wanted it to have never been that way. I wanted you to be an active part of that partnership. And I know you couldn't be, I know you had so much to work out on your own. 

I've never loved someone so much and felt so lonely laying next time them at the same time. I thought I could love you enough for the both of us, I thought I could fight hard enough for this relationship that it could make up for what you were not giving it. But I burnt out.

And now I'm doing it. Travelling. I talked about it so much but I'm finally making it happen. In a couple of months I'll (hopefully if I get the job) be moving to the other side of the country. And then 6 or 7 months later I'll be taking off to the other side of the world. 

I hope you find your happy. I hope you find another love of your life. I hope you treat her better than you treated me. I'm not bitter. I'll find someone to love me like I need to be loved, one day. But for now that's not even on my mind. I have 0 desire to be with anyone. I've turned myself off on that level because I'm going to put all of the energy into myself, my friendships and my relationships with my family. Those are the people who will have me 100% for now. 

I will work hard at discovering the life I want around the world. I will be open to meeting loads of lovely people but I will remain true to myself above all else. 

I love you. I hope we can speak again one day, maybe 10 years from now. Maybe by the it won't be painful to think of your name.",23Jan2017,2

18,"Hey Reddit!

My best friend moved to Florida a few months ago where they bought a new home and gave birth to a beautiful baby boy.  Yesterday her husband was driving back to NC to visit his mom when a drunk driver, driving on the wrong side of the road with no lights on hit him head on. He has severe injuries and is currently on life support. 

I am trying to organize a trip to visit with them as soon as possible, but in the mean time I am wanting to send them a care package. I was wondering if any of you had any suggestions as to what someone might need at a time like this?

I am planning on sending grocery gift cards and snacks, but I also wanted some more ideas to cover as many needs for them as possible. Any one who's ever been in this situation may have more insight on what you needed at a time like this. Even if you've never experienced this any suggestions for what she might need for herself, the baby, or things to help with his recovery would be so greatly appreciated.

19,"Hi Reddit, I'm nearly 16, I'm in 10th Grade and I have been pondering whether I should move to London after I graduate high school and attend college in the UK.

Let me tell you about myself. I love making music, I also like world politics and enjoy keeping up with current events because I feel like I, unlike many of my peers, realize the massive repercussions world events have. 

  I also enjoy programming and web development, I know Python, and Java. I considered majoring in either Computer Science, Political Science, or Journalism. I'm bent on whether I should become a politician/political activist as an adult, or if I should become a computer scientist.

   I live in the Washington DC Metropolitan area, in Northern Virginia. I have two aunts who live in London, and that makes the idea of moving to London all the more enticing, not to mention the lower tuition and exceptional schools in the UK, and also just the fact that I'll be in Europe, a place I've never been before.

It seems like a good place to take a look back.  And forwards.  Hell, I never thought I'd make it this far.  Maybe I'll drop dead in a week.  Maybe I'll live to see people uploaded into a machine consciousness or something.

Death.  I don't find fear in that concept.  When I was a kid, it was a terror.  Maybe that's some part of why I have bipolar or don't relate well.  Death was such a big deal it was embrace it or be surprised by it.  I fell in love for a while.  Danced the suicidal shuffle a few times.  Might do that again.  Maybe not.

I made a bunch of kids.  They're smart.  I hope what I taught them matters.  I hope it helps.  I hope I didn't break them along the way by being broken as much as I have been.

I want to imagine it's the world that is broken and needs to change, but the world...  I don't get it.  I can't not think of humans as humans, and whatever doesn't involve me in their lives, well, doesn't involve me.  I can't judge.

I'll never be rich.  It might be nice, for awhile.  I'd just give it all away, though, in the end.

Maybe I should save the world and myself.  Move away, disconnect, remove my influence.  One less madman in the mix, so to speak.

I'm planning on basically doing that.  Moving way out to nowhere, almost no internet.  Flush toilet and all, but 30 minutes from a convenience store.  I won't be trying to go out much.  I want to work on my writing, maybe do something else with that world.  Maybe garden.  Maybe take college courses.

I hope the friends that say they will come see me will.  I find myself almost afraid of that deafening quiet.  I have to be alone.  With me.  Writing whatever comes from that will either be what drives me truly batshit insane or will be the preserver I cling to in that sea of madness.

I think about who I am sometimes.  I look for me.  The idea that 'I' am just controlling a bone and meat avatar is a nice idea, but I want to touch it, you know?  Close my eyes and pull back into the aether, see that dimension.  Maybe that's what I see when I close my eyes and just be.

So I live in the DC area and as a teenager without a car I have used the Subway to get too and fro various locations with friends etc. So I was standing on the platform waiting for the train to arrive. As it roared past, right at the moment it reached where I was standing, I felt the strange urge to jump in front. I'm not suicidal, I've never seriously considered suicide, much less attempted it, but it was a really weird feeling. It was very much an out of body experience, and I think the feeling wasn't to commit suicide in particular, nor was it an ""ooo what would happen"" sort of experience if that makes any sense at all. It was somewhere in the middle and I felt very much out of my own control, with many fabrics of my being telling me, to jump in front of the train. Thankfully, I remained put and watched the train roll on by to it's eventual halt. I was shaken though, and I just thought about it the whole train ride and to this day, I think, ""why in the world did I get the urge to jump?"". 

I've read some cool things on the phenomenon of how when people, say, stand on a high structure or building, get the strange urge to jump off. I don't want to say that my experience is the same exact thing but, I believe it to be similar. So I just wanted to ask, Has anyone experienced this same type of thing?

39,"They didn't *create* neo-Nazis, of course; neo-Nazis did that on their own.

But reddit, GamerGate, YouTube ""rationals"", and of course 4chan have developed and encouraged a culture of postmodern irony in which neo-Nazis not only thrive, they consciously blur the lines between what is real and what isn't to cultivate a highly visible yet plausibly deniable bigotry in the minds of people who earnestly believe that they're *opposed* to that bigotry.

Here's Wikipedia's description of [postmodernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism):

&gt;While encompassing a broad range of ideas and projects, **postmodernism is typically defined by** an attitude of **skepticism or distrust toward** grand narratives, **ideologies**, and various tenets of Enlightenment rationality, including **the existence of objective reality** and **absolute truth**, as well as notions of **rationality**, human nature, **and progress**.[4] Instead, **it asserts that knowledge and truth are the product of** unique systems of **social, historical, or political discourse and interpretation**, and are therefore contextual and constructed to varying degrees. Accordingly, **postmodern thought is broadly characterized by** tendencies to epistemological and **moral relativism**, pluralism, **self-referentiality**, and **irony**.[4]

So what does that mean?

Let's look at [what happened in \/r/CringeAnarchy yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/5phjov/pure_homegrown_cringe/) -- a user discovered that the CringeAnarchy mods have linked the sub to [\/r/altright](/r/altright), a subreddit composed of actual, literal neo-Nazis. This is not some ""meta"" joke: CringeAnarchy was [*founded*](/user/Deathwave88) and is [*administered*](/user/Dindu_Muffins) by -- again, actual, literal -- white supremacists. Many CringeAnarchy users are deeply upset by this revelation. ""Off-color jokes are all well and good, but we didn't come here for white supremacy!"" is the dominant cry among much of the user base.

What repeatedly escapes these people is that these subreddits they participate in (CringeAnarchy, DankMemes, 4chan, Drama, watchpeopledie, ImGoingToHellForThis, KotakuInAction, TumblrInAction, MensRights, The_Donald, etc.) -- subreddits with a strong emphasis on postmodern irony, self-referentialism, moral relativity, and off-color jokes (!) -- are [*crawling* with](http://i.imgur.com/MbBEGep.png), and in many cases *run* by, these white supremacists and [other](http://imgur.com/a/ms9c6) [bigots](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/505el5/every_day_i_submit_an_example_of_rthe_donalds/).

This is not a coincidence, or some historical accident. There is a concerted, organized effort by white supremacists to normalize their ideologies by muddying the distinction between ""actual racism"" and irony, and it begins in these subreddits. They're *preying* on them.

[This is from The Daily Stormer](https://archive.is/pgIEo#selection-317.105-317.489), one of the largest white supremacist sites on the Internet:

&gt;However, **for White Nationalists, the really great thing about Reddit is that it provides quite a lot of fertile ground for recruiting young people into the pro-White movement**.  Reddit has a strong reputation for being a far-left SJW hugbox and it’s frequently mentioned in the same breath as Tumblr.  However, many areas of Reddit are much more open to our ideas than you might think....

&gt;**Go on European-dominated subreddits and drop subtle redpills.**  Don’t use “gas the kikes, race war now”-type rhetoric, obviously. If you must, say “Zionists” rather than “Jews.” Use their hatred of Israel and turn it into hatred of Jewry.  Be subtle, be smart, and be persuasive.

&gt;**We brought 4chan over to our side long ago.  Now, we need to focus on redpilling Reddit – then, soon enough, every other major website.**  The Internet is our most important tool in the struggle against the Jewish parasite, hence why so many of the filthy nation-wreckers want governments to filter it.  Use the Internet wisely, brothers.  It is a very potent weapon.

&gt;Once we succeed at **making our ideas mainstream on the Internet** – thus winning over the hearts and minds of the youth – it’s game over for international Jewry.

That was posted just about 2 years ago. Can you think of anything that's changed on this site in the last 2 years?

redditors laughed at [media reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/28/once-comic-pepe-the-frog-has-been-declared-a-hate-symbol/) of ""Pepe the racist frog"" last year, and of course we can all agree that mainstream journalists' reporting of Internet youth culture can be breathless and vapid and it frequently misses the point entirely. But the near-universal dismissal of this issue is exactly the sort of postmodernism we're talking about here. It's hard to argue that white supremacists and their useful-idiot ""trolls"" used the Pepe meme to great effect during the US election process. But their greatest achievement in that department was making the very *notion* of white supremacist memes so ironic, so meta, that they got the rest of the Internet to join in on the ""joke"" with them.

Other tropes and concepts favored or invented by white supremacists that have been mainstreamed in the last 2 years include:

All of this has been enabled and encouraged by a ""nothing is sacred"" culture in which young people have been assured that calling others ""faggots"" and ""dindus"" isn't actually bigotry and doesn't actually cause any harm. We can argue all day about whether that's actually true on an individual basis -- yes, I know about your gay and black friends -- but speaking purely on a pragmatic, macro level we can plainly see what the effect has been. This is the company you people are drawing. They've groomed you into creating the perfect environment for them, and now they're moving in -- like mold growing in a pile of wet clothes.

You can carry on smug in the belief that you're not part of an ""ideology"" -- that you're sitting on the top of that horse shoe in South Park Land where nothing matters and everything happens in isolation -- but you're wrong. You've simply taken up the arrogant, anti-intellectual, un-self-critical philosophy of ""common sense"" that young people mock older generations for and wrapped it in a layer of modern-day pseudo-nihilist humor and pop-culture ""science"", and there are real people in the real world who are suffering for it right now.

I'm not saying you should all go join the social justice movement (though I'm sure you can guess what my position on that is). But if you *really* believe in ""reason"" and ""logic"" like you say you do, you have a duty to yourself and to the rest of us to critically examine your beliefs and actions, what arguments there might be against them, and the potential effects they might have on the world. Because this isn't going to get better otherwise. As long as ""anything goes"", these people are here to stay.

42,"I'm a 21 y.o female and I quit my job recently. There's this guy that I had a little opportunity to talk to. I've been attracted to him since the very first day that I saw him.  I'll never see him again and I just can't stop thinking about him. I don't have his number or him on my FB friends list. It's gotten to a point that I just can't help but thinking about him all day and all night long. The only way that I can contact him is asking him about guitars or asking him to teach me how to play the guitar. I'm scared that he'll reject me because of age gap and all.

44,"My room mate recently had her boyfriend commit suicide in a very public way. He made news, and it was in front of a hospital. 

She was already severely mentally unstable. Suicidal, and given up. She'd been dating him for a couple months. 

He seemed like a great guy,  but I'm a firm believer broken attracts broken. 


They spent a lot of time together. His last week he was with her everyday. He dropped her off on her birthday,  Jan 17. She said she had a great time, other than a couple moments he spoke of murder suicide. But of course, he was joking. He had a gun in the car, but he was a hunter. Wasn't unusual. He said he was going to sell it. Which again, wasn't unusual. So, he drops her off, they say their goodbyes all lovey like. We wave goodbye. 

15 min later, she tears out of her room asking wtf to do about someone who may be in danger of blowing their head of. I was on the phone with a co worker and said, you call 911 and give them all the info you can. So she does so. I finish my call, and go to her room. I read his last Facebook post. It's beyond a suicide note. She's on the phone with 911. 

I leave for work, telling her it's alright. It'll work out. 

Well, I find out by browsing my twitter on smoke break, that a man has shot himself at the emergency service doors at a local hospital. The media is all over it. 

Hubby texts me saying there is police in our home interviewing my room mate. 

So he's dead. And she is now mourning. I get that. And I will never tell her how long to grieve or tell her to buck up. Hell no. 

But it's 24/7 of worrying if I'm going to wake up to her dead. If she's going to do something stupid. She's not eating. Sleep, get stoned, freak out, get more stoned, freak out harder, bed, and repeat. Wears the same clothes. Especially his pants and boxers. Carries the knife he gave her. Sleeps with it. 

She knows she needs help but won't do it. She says she can't go near any emergency department of any hospital. That the doctors won't help. She won't take pills. And absolutely won't be put into the psych ward. 

I don't know what I can do anymore. Half the time I feel like she's purposely putting herself into situations that will make her lose it. Like, constantly staring at his photo. Or posting photos. Walking down the alley they used to toke in. Checking out the window with every car passing. Drinking his whiskey. 

Then she'll sit down beside me when I'm on the phone and just start talking about him, crying, freaking out. I have a business. This makes it hard for me to run. I've had conversations about him, I've listened, offered whatever I can, tried my hardest to get her to pull herself out for even a min, just to eat. Nothing works. 

I dont know what to do for her. But it's mentally taxing on me, and I cannot be her caregiver. I cannot be around her 24/7. But I'm made to feel guilty cause I have to work, or do chores, or walk the dog, or go to the store, hell even if I'm taking a shower or shit. Even guilting people into doing stuff for her. (smoke pot with her, go to store to buy milk, etc) 

Help. Please. Anything. I dont want her to die too.",23Jan2017,4
45,"That's how I feel right know. I believe I'm full of potential and hunger for life, but I'm just stuck in a situition that is my life. All these strings attached that I never really wanted in the first place and Im just going deeper and deeper.

46,"I have never been very political involved in my life but in the last year I found myself going crazy about where I stand politically, especially since the 2016 presidential elections.   
  
I work in an industry that is very passionately left-leaning, and am also heavily involved in certain hobbies that have a significant amount of right-leaning people.   
  
As for my personal beliefs, they tend to range from centre-left to libertarianish, so I do not always align politically with my left-wing colleagues and right-leaning friends but that has never stopped me from getting along with either groups, until the past 6 months or so.   
   
The chaos leading up the election and now the new POTUS taking office has resulted in a very politically charged atmosphere in the workplace and outside, and for the first time I am feeling a sense of alienation.  
  
As I don't align fully with either the left or the right, I sympathise with my friends and colleagues on both sides but I am seeing a lot of resentment among both groups against each other.  
  
Now I find my self pondering bullshit like ""Are my friends really just a bunch of selfish anti-intellectual bigots?"" Or ""Do I work among a bunch elitist anti-American nutjobs?"".   
   
I don't want to be an oddball. I want to fit in. Sometimes I feel like maybe I'm literally a bad person for some of my beliefs. I try to rethink my opinions and try to agree more with one particular side but I just cant. I feel like both sides have certain beliefs I just can't get behind fully.    
    
I have literally reconsidered my career path, but I genuinely like what I do, and I like and respect the people I work with as well as the big names in the industry who are very vocal politically.   
    
I have literally reconsidered my social groups, but I genuinely enjoy those hobbies and I like and respect the people involved.   
   
All this sounds stupid and It is, but I've been obsessing over this crap to the extent of becoming a borderline anti-social hermit hopelessly searching for an answer to a question I can't even really understand myself.   
   
Just wanted to get this off my chest.   
I probably should see a therapist.

48,"If you read Reddit much, you've seen redditors talking about not having friends. They sometimes ask how everyone else seems to have such complete social lives. It's a good question. I don't think that this is the sort of subject that anyone is an expert on, but I do feel that I've had more experience in this field than most because of how many times I've needed to find new friends.

So here are examples of how I've made my friend groups in the past, and if you need any help improving your social life, maybe there are some things you can pull from my experiences. Please don't take this as a humblebrag, I'm just trying to help.

* Childhood: Made friends in class organically, kids are good at this. Eventually my local classmates and I hung out regularly.

* High School: Played on Football and lacrosse teams, also made friends with people in my classes because we all spent 6 hrs a day together and did projects together etc. Going into high school I hadn't played any team sports and didn't really know anyone on either team, I just pushed myself to join and eventually it became normal.

* Freshman Year College: Made friends with many people on the same floor in my dorm. Everybody was brand new and looking for friends, it felt a little forced at first (because it was) but you gotta fight through a little uncomfortableness to break through. We mostly would swing by each other's rooms and ask to go to the dining hall together or stop by and play video games together until real friendship blossomed. Also joined the theatre group and made friends there because it just naturally occurs when you spend so much time with other people in vulnerable scenarios like acting.

* Sophomore College: Transferred schools, but had a couple of high school friends attending the new college. Tougher year though. Made friends with my roommate (who turned out to be a sociopath) and made a handful of friends through him and through my high school friends, but overall felt pretty lonely.

* Third Year College: Decided to sign up for a study abroad semester with the hope that I would bond with cool people on the trip. It happens super organically when you're abroad because the culture differences make you feel automatically closer to the people you travel with. I found my core group of college friends this way and lived with them for the rest of our studies.

* Post-College: Moved an hour from the city that I went to college at. Made friends with my new roommates but otherwise it was pretty lonely and I didnt make many new friends. Mostly went to see my college friends on weekends. Started planning to emigrate to Brazil (where I did study abroad) because I really wanted to spend more time in the culture. Saved up ~$5000 and studied Portuguese for ~1.5 years to gear up for the move.

* Brazil: Knew a handful of people in a handful of cities but didn't have any really good friends. Fortunately my Portuguese teacher let me live with her for a few weeks while I adjusted to the move and started applying for work. Traveled between cities every couple of weeks, had a few acquaintances let me stay with them and some friendships started through this. Empathy is a good start for a friendship. In cities where I knew no one, I would stay in hostels and meet people at the hostel by asking if they wanted to go to some tourist destination or go to a museum or something. That approach to meeting people worked every time and often I would spend the next 4-5 days doing everything with my new friends. Eventually it was time to focus hard on my job search and I was wearing out my welcome on my friend's couch so I rented a room in a nice apartment for a month. There were 4 French and 1 Turkish ex-pats living in the apt and all were in their 20s (I was 26) so oftentimes we would hang out at night and watch a movie or something. They all had jobs and I was having no luck with my job search so I often had some lonely and/or depressing days. I met one guy on a ""ex-pats in Brazil"" type website and hung out a few times but mostly I had a lonely month. Eventually my job search didn't result in anything and I moved back into my parents house while I search for jobs in the US.

* Post-Brazil: After a few lonely months of doing a job search from half of a bedroom in my parents' house, I found a job in my home state. Fortunately, one of my childhood friends was also in the state so we found an apartment together in our local city. I started reaching out to people that I was friends with in high school (but I had since mostly lost contact with) that I knew were still in the area. **Lots of people are insecure about their social lives and will be very receptive if you reach out to them.** Started hanging out with a couple of them and even made a few new friends through them. This is pretty much where I'm at now. I don't have a ton of friends that I see regularly anymore but I'm mostly comfortable with my circle of friends, and I've spent the last year or so more focused on finding a good gf with some ups and downs.


I'm thinking about making some new local friends that in the local music scene because I also play music. My plan is to go to a local venue once a week and just start up conversations with people who interest me. I won't ""click"" with everyone, but I'm bound to find someone that I'll be friends with. It can be a little awkward and uncomfortable, but it's inevitable that you meet people that you just mesh well with and that's how friendships can start.

49,"I think that's a lot more common than a lot of us realize.  They wanted to do the right thing by our family, they wanted to give us love and happiness and warmth, and raise us to be strong and forthright and honest.

But they were *completely* emotionally unprepared and unequipped to be parents.  They were probably about as unprepared for it as it is possible for otherwise good, decent people to be.

When I was in my early and middle twenties, I really sort of hated them for the family life that we had (not physically or sexually abusive, but still pretty bad), but now that I'm a bit older (early 30s), and reflecting on how emotionally unequipped ***I*** am to be an *adult,* let alone a parent (I'm not, but I was reflecting on it, :P) I realized that they did the best they could.  It was pathetic, but they literally didn't know how to do any better.",23Jan2017,273
50,"My insurance company has been denying my claims for months.  I've been calling them every month to ask why.  Every month they ask me to make a phone call, fill out a form, speak to a representative, or perform some administrative task which I always do promptly.

Because my claims haven't been paid in months, my allergy doctor won't be treating me unless I pay them a considerable amount out of my pocket.  This time they want a letter from a previous insurance company of mine.  After talking to that company for a half hour, they said they could get the letter to me in two weeks.

I want to cry, yell, throw something, or just express my frustration, but I have a toddler napping in my arms.  I want to take her to the aquarium like I promised, but I need to get myself together first.  She fell asleep cuddling with me as I was on the phone for the last 90 minutes.

I have a wonderful therapist that I would love to see, but that would be another insurance claim I'd have to contend with.

69,"Baah, I usually read reddit and everytime I get frustrated I tend to write down my emotions, for which I usually have a book, but I don´t feel like it would fit that book this time around.

So I have been going out for 4 months with a woman who I actually believe, to be the love of my life. We've had great months, great experiences, I've never felt for anyone before like how I've felt for her. The only problem is, she had a really troublesome past. And that makes her tend to have silly discussions with me about things that should have never been a discussion in the first place (yes, she admitted this, it's not just my side of the story). We discuss a lot about my father and how my parents impose themselves a lot in my life (21M), or how I sometimes may talk to a woman or perhaps something silly that happened that ended in us having a small discussion. The problem is I feel like all this took it's toll last thursday when I wasn't feeling exactly well, and I hadn't seen her for 12 days. We were supposed to meet up and have a wonderful and sexy day together, but due to my obvious illness and fever my mom said she wouldn't let me out, which I was angry about but honestly knew it was the right thing to do.
Whelp, she didn't take it that great. I told her I wasn't going to her home anytime soon (11AM) because I felt like shit and my mom told me not to leave home, and this turned out into a full-blown discussion from her to me about my parents, about my personality, about how I do nothing to change, blablabla, and she started saying how her sisters bf is so much better, how he makes her feel special, takes her places, basically that she is his princess (implicitly saying I was something pretty close to garbage). This made me feel like shit because, believe, I know it's not like that, and even if it was, I am a pretty introverted person and she is very extroverted, I try my best to satisfy her sometimes but it takes its toll on me and for her to even dismiss all my efforts as nothing made me feel like shit.

The problem is, when she stops being angry she tells me it was just to make me react, to get something out of me (because I just stop caring during these discussions because she's never going to accept I am right or my opinion) a reaction or something, and that she would never feel like that, she doesn't feel like that, that I'm very special for her, that I'm her only, that she pretty much loves me and how I am, but it's just that when she gets angry she loses focus of things.

Fast forward to today, monday. We got together, and I have been strange a couple of days because I was feeling awkward around her. I felt completely thrashed around and, I don't know, just felt kinda hurt in general. And we had a serious talk today. About if I wanted to keep going with her, if I was in love with her, if I projected my life with (let's say, she's 25 almost 26 and is pretty much on the doors of life to start building her own) and I answered that I didn't know, that I needed time to think, that I couldn't answer her questions in such a small time window.

In the end, she had to leave early so we left some knots untied. But she feels like I don't really feel anything for her and that I shouldn't force myself to feel anything, while I feel like shit for letting possibly the kindest and most beautiful person, and also the one that has most honestly loved me, go away from my life like just that.

I don't know, I don't know if this feeling is supposed to go away with time or if I'm never gonna overcome it. Or if I'm just being an idiot for love and should just not care at all. I just needed a couple of days to reorder my feelings, I was kinda confused and hurt after that thursday, so I can't really feel properly, but she says that ""true love doesn't get disturbed by anything, not any fight would make one person who truly loves another one make the love go away. We could have the worst fight in the world, but I would never stop caring for you"", but I feel that's because I've never really said anything horrible to her when we're discussing, it's always a one-sided gun fight where I am bare-handed (by option). And there's also the thing where she's had horrible experiences (she was hit heavily by one of her older bfs) so she tends to be more reactive to bad situations.

Anyway, that's that. Now I'm writing this down because I honestly can't understand what my feelings are. I do imagine myself in the future working with her, in our own apartment having fun and all, but at the same time I have certain... apprehensions towards the relationship.
I am 100% sure we can overcome this, but I just can't go back to normal like nothing happened. I need a gradual reincorporation into the relationship, perhaps take things slow. But she can't understand this, that love never goes away and blablabla that what I felt never was true love, but it's not that I don't care for her anymore, it's just that... I dunno. I may be afraid? Hurt? Disappointed? Tired of all the fighting?

Oh well, let that be it. Thank you for reading dear stranger",23Jan2017,1
70,"Hi,

I'm 20 years old and I developed a real passion for soccer when I was 18. Before that age, I've never played soccer (not even with friends just for fun). Now two years later, my passion for soccer is only getting stronger and last year, I signed up for goalkeeper lessons. I consider myself quite talented in goalkeeping (since I've only just started), but I am currently only getting about 3 trainings a month and I am not playing in a team.

I'm really dreaming to play at a high level one day and I'm willing to work extremely hard to still develop a succesful soccer carreer. Due to my age, this might seem ""impossible"", but I've always believed that everything is possible - especially in soccer - and I really believe it now too. So my idea was to start a crowdfunding project for a documentary web series where I train to become a professional goalkeeper. With the money from the crowdfunding, I could assemble a dreamteam to guide me to the top and reserve some money for a living (since I won't be able to work full-time due to my trainings).

So my question is, does this sound like something you would back on Kickstarter? And does this seem like a documentary that you would watch (let's assume it is a high quality professional documentary).

Thanks a lot for your honest opinions!",23Jan2017,1
