1,"I really don't know where to post this and I'm in the heat of the moment. Sorry if this is unappropiate for this sub.

Some background, the house we live in is my grandparents'. A uncle from the family lives here too. He hates my mother's guts and he taught his sons to treat her like trash too. 

So, some hours ago my mother went to shop for dinner. I was alone in the house, but this changed when the family of douchebags arrived and started roaming around the house. Didn't pay any mind to then, I was in my room.

Fastfoward some hours, my mother arrives and first thing she says is ""My cellphone was on the living room table, where is it?"". Family of douchebags proceeds to lock up in their rooms. We are hysteric and we're looking in every corner for her phone. Calls go directly to voicemail so this is starting to get worrying.

I know for a fact they grabbed the phone. I was home alone when they arrived and I saw the phone beforehand, didn't grabbed it because I thought it wouldn't be necessary. 

She already logged out of her Facebook, her concern are the photos from family trips. She can't ask the asshole uncle because the whole family has threatened her to not even look in their general direction or there will be physical trouble. Of course they don't have the guts of doing anything because they get kicked out ASAP. 

I really don't know what to do. Already tried talking with one of the kids, but he didn't even turn around to hear. 

Anything I should know? We're trying to lock her phone, Phone Tracker says it's here on the house. If we do find out they took it, what should we do?

Again sorry if this isn't the most appropiate place to post this. We're still in heat and my first thought was this sub. ",10Jul2017,1
2,"As a musician, I enjoy music usually in a very sterile, technical way. Songs don't really invoke emotional responses from me that often, except for Wild Horses. I first heard it about ten years ago and since then every time I hear it it makes a lump in my chest and sometimes I even shed a tear and I can't say why. I'm not sad or emotional when I listen to it, but for some reason it always hits me hard. It's not a bad thing, I'm amazed at its ability to do that, but I find it interesting that seemingly without any particular cause it moves me so much.",10Jul2017,1
3,"To the guy who offered to buy me coffee  at the coffee shop inside the bookstore where we were both studying this afternoon, I feel so dumb for turning you down. I regretted it as soon as I said it. 

I'm not used to people actually paying attention to me. I've been single for a while now, and most of my friends have moved away after we graduated from college. On top of that, I just started  graduate-level classes for a degree in the medical field and it's the most difficult thing I've ever had to do. Studying takes up just about every hour of every day. So I've been isolated, stressed, and lonely, hoping someone would reach out to me. And you did. 

We made eye contact a few times as you walked past my table, but I didn't expect you to actually come up and talk to me. I was so busy staring into my textbooks and worrying about the upcoming week that I was completely caught off guard and before I could think, I just blurted out, ""no I'm good, thanks."" You seemed so nice and I totally wasted my chance to talk to you, to engage in a real conversation about something other than school, to get out of the miserable, lonely rut I've been in. 

I thought about leaving my number when I left, but you left without me noticing at some point before I did. I've never been good in social situations, so I guess I'm not really surprised that my first reaction was to avoid human interaction. Still, I feel like a huge idiot.   

I'll probably go back to that bookstore again-it really was a nice place to study. If I ever see you again, I hope you'll give me a second chance.",10Jul2017,353

10,"I went to the beach in Toronto right after it rained. I went at night, too. There were lots of mosquitoes, and I was wearing sandals, so to avoid getting bitten, I buried my feet in the sand. 

I did not know sand fleas were a thing. 

My feet and ankles are now VERY red, VERY sore and swollen, and it's incredibly itchy and hard to walk. Somehow this happened to one of my hands too?

I read about how these sand assholes bury themselves in your skin and have babies. I guess I'm now a mother?

I'm really upset. Sorry for the rant. I'm going to the doctor tomorrow but until then I want to stick my feet into a vat of alcohol or just cut them off. This is so painful and itchy and creepy-feeling. I can't sleep and I hate myself for being so stupid",10Jul2017,3
12,"My first pet as an adult, adopted from a local shelter. He's a 3 month old orange tabby named Taffy, but that'll change soon enough. My roommate suggested Morty, as in Rick &amp; Morty, but... eh. I'm leaning towards Gohan, like the character from Dragon Ball. Either that, or 49er the 4th, the successor to three of my childhood cats (none of them ever played football, though).

First thing he does when we get him home? Runs and hides behind our fridge. After rescuing him from himself, I brought him into my room, where he basically slept under my bed for most of the day. I had a bunch of boxes and random junk down their, so I slowly moved most of it out to try and limit hiding spaces. Finally managed to coax him out with food and water a couple of hours ago. After about 30 minutes of peaking out from under and retreating several times, I managed to get him to play with a string toy for a bit. Ended up wandering around my bedroom to check everything out soon enough.

He likes pets, but not being held so much. Pretty noisy with the meowing, too. Maybe tomorrow, I can have him explore the rest of the house without going behind heavy appliances again.

It's been a good day.",10Jul2017,7
13,"Don't go looking in your closet. If you ever go back to the house you grew up in, just stay away from it. If you look around, you'll find horrible things. Things that will scare you to the bones. 

There's the old shirt from that person you loved. Behind your letterjacket and sweaters, a drawing on the wall you did when you were little, of your dog that died. There's the project you worked on in school, but gave up after struggling. Hidden under a shoe box there's a bloody pin you used to poke and scratch yourself with before you knew what self-harm was. 

You'll find the bag with all the cards from graduation years ago. You'll read tender, sincere letters from people that you used to consider your closest friends. Your old sweetheart. The friend from elementary school. That teacher that had a heart attack while you were away. The neighbors across the street. The last card you ever got from both your parents. 

Then you'll remember that almost all of these people have no connection to your life anymore. They don't know you. You don't know them. Maybe you never knew really knew each other at all. And you'll wonder if any of the people in your life know you, and if they'll be in your life in another 10 years. You'll realize that you are alone. Terribly alone, and you've never been otherwise.

You'll wake up hours later in a dried pool of tears.

Don't go looking in that closet.",10Jul2017,3
14,"This is going to be an unusual post, but I wanted to tell someone what I'm thinking and I can't post about this on Facebook. I created this account just for this post. Been casually browsing Reddit for awhile without an account, so now I have one.

Anyway, my whole life, I've been overweight. I was always the fat girl in the group. When my boobs started to develop, they were just another fat roll. I mean, they obviously felt different from the other fat rolls, but when I wore a tight top, it looked like I had several rows of boobs. I never liked having boobs, because I was just more fat to deal with. Unfortunately, mine are on the larger side.

Well, over the last year and a half, I've been losing weight. I lost 218 pounds, and now I'm 156 pounds. People who have known me my whole life don't even recognise me. It took alot of work, and I feel better than I ever have my entire life.

With that comes my new thoughts on my breasts. They're no longer just more fat. In fact they're not even really ""fat"" like they were before. Before, they were very soft and more fluid. Now they're pretty much the same size, but now they're firm and don't move around as much. They bounce, of course, but they're no longer ""fluid"".

And I love them. They feel absolutely amazing! I'm almost always aware of them. Wearing a tight top feels really good now. It hugs my figure and lightly presses on my boobs and I feel very feminine and more confident. I know I can't be the only girl that experiences this. Or maybe it's just because I lost all that weight and now I'm really experiencing the female body for the first time (in a sense) so I'm more aware of it.

Anyway, I just wanted to share this with someone, and didn't know where else to go. Sorry if this was a weird post.",10Jul2017,2
19,"I'm not doing good. I haven't been to work for over a week. I do the bare minimum. I'm a lazy cunt. Self-loathing. Miserable. Cunt. I went to the doctor on Friday. She prescribed me anti-depressants I still haven't picked up yet.

I can't stop drinking on the weekends. There is nothing else I feel like doing. This isn't good. I have maybe one good week out of twelve. This isn't how I want to live. Four good weeks out of a bloody year. Been this way a long time, even when I didn't drink. 

Nothing helps. Counselling doesn't help me. I tried it many times but it is just not for me. Pills don't help. Drinking and drugs don't help long term. Doing different things don't help.

25,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this for advice, but I'm hoping someone who has been in a similar situation can help. Any comments I make about Indian culture, in general, are a combination of my own observations and what my bf has told me. Any generalizations I make are for convenience's sake. 

My boyfriend (27) and I (24) have been together for over 2 years. He is Indian, I am an American woman. We met in Canada as we both went to school here and currently live together. We are very happy in our relationship, have very good communication, and have solid plans to get married one day. My parents and my grandparents have met my bf and they all love him, so no problem there.

It's the norm for Indian parents to not ask about their children's dating lives. They just want to know when you're ready to get married - no gradual introduction to your boyfriend/girlfriend needed, and they often don't really want to ""get to know"" them regardless of where they're from.  

This definitely goes for my bf's parents, clearly. He went to India to visit his family over a year ago and delicately broached the topic with them about his intentions to live in North America long-term, as well as the likelihood he would be with a western woman (we were together at the time, but he was being intentionally vague because these things have to be spoken about carefully and his parents need to be slowly broken into the idea.) They told him they would ideally want him to marry a woman from his province and come live in India, but as I recall at the end of these conversations they admitted they want him to be with someone of good character and for him to be happy. 

Bf invited them to come visit him in Canada a few months ago. Maybe a month or so before they were scheduled to arrive, he told them specifically about me for the first time. This may seem strange from the outside, and that he's not taking the relationship seriously by waiting so long to tell them, but I promise it's just a ""protocol.""
They were pretty inflamed by this, and his dad sent him a message later saying he was ""very disturbed."" His mom was saying how he was going to abandon them and never visit them again. She was also asserting that I wouldn't be able to understand or respect their culture, that I will be overwhelmed by the way they live their lives. She was clearly getting a bit dramatic, saying something to the effect of ""we pull food out of the garden with our hands, will she be able to cope with this way of life?"" (For what it's worth, I grew up in a rural area and my dad always had me do yard work and I love gardening so I think I'll be fine ;) ) He has explained this to her, that I am pretty much the opposite of what they're picturing, but no luck.

My bf has been really stressed about this, as there is a lot of pressure on him to make the whole situation right and to bring us all together. I feel bad because there isn't much I can do. I've explained to him that his parents (and both his sisters, who have been even more dramatic about this) have this caricature of a western woman in their minds who will not let their son go visit his family and will cause him to lose respect for his culture. This, of course, is not true at all. I can't wait to visit India and meet his whole family. I'll do everything I can to appreciate their culture, and I don't think I'll be easily fazed by it. I've been lucky enough to do a lot of traveling in my life to a few places that have completely different ways of life to the west; not only will I be able to handle it, I have a great appreciation for cultural diversity. I've told him he would only have to worry so much if he had any reason to believe what they are saying about me is true (easier said than done, I know). It isn't true, and he knows this, of course. 

Anyway, they're in Canada now. They arrived a couple days ago, and last night he had another discussion about them meeting me. Didn't go well, although I don't have all the details as bf is staying at the Airbnb with them and we haven't spoken in depth about it yet. He told me they're saying the same things as before, however, and they basically said no, we don't want to meet her. They will be here for over a month, but I am leaving for the states in a couple weeks to visit my family, so he is determined to make this meeting happen soon. 

Is there any advice anyone can give me about how to best act around them when/if I get the chance to meet them? Or, any tips for my bf when it comes to talking to them about this and how to get around their stubbornness? I will do everything I can to be respectable, which I am sure will put them at ease. I really believe once we get the chance to meet a couple times and they see how I am different from what they have pictured, they will be more accepting. But in the meantime, I just would love to hear from someone of Indian culture, whether or not you have been in this position before! ",10Jul2017,26

28,"I just wanted to share my story and struggle with SSRI medication and my current journey to get off of them. I have struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life. When I say I have anxiety I get a lot of ""Oh, I get anxious sometimes too"" but I don't think everyone understands what it's like to have anxiety so bad that you cannot leave the house or have a hard time holding a job. I have been to therapy since I was young and nothing every helped so that is why when I was a freshman or sophomore in college I decided that taking pharmaceuticals may be my only option. I was prescribed many different drugs to figure out what worked for me (beta-blockers and anti-psychotics) until one day I finally tried an anti-depressant (SSRI) and I felt like it actually worked. I ended up taking Lexapro or Escitalopram. I have taken this drug for such a long time that I kept needing to go up on the dose until I hit what is usually the maximum for daily use. To be honest, it helped - I don't know what I would have done without it. A few years later and some side effects kicked in; I gained 50 lbs in a two month period with no change in diet or exercise, my hormones were acting up, I had adult acne out of nowhere! I told myself that I wanted to be able to get off of this medication for a few years before I was pregnant so as I got closer to 30 I decided I needed to get off of them. 

Getting off of these is the hardest thing I have ever done. I first started weaning off of my does and I had electric shock feelings, migraines and intense headaches, and extreme irritability. It was already a nightmare and I wasn't even completely off of the medication! 

I have a doctor that is helping me wean off of the medication and I am taking a ton of different supplements to help downplay the withdrawal symptoms. 

I am now two weeks strong of not taking any SSRI medication and as much as I am very happy, I feel like crap. I know it will pass and I know I will be better in the end but this is so much harder than I thought it would be. After 8 years of heavy SSRI use, I am finally free of them but unfortunately the withdrawal symptoms have been so terrible that I am actually quitting my job and taking a few months off to just get better. 

There is no real point to this post I just needed to share this somewhere. ",10Jul2017,2
29,"I have had a rough fucking weekend between the really dark thoughts that crept in a couple times and my lack of rum. A lot had happened in just three days and I'm still reeling from it. I acknowledge that some people have it worse; it's a valid thought, but an absofuckinglutely useless one. I am not those other people and my life circumstances are not theirs as theirs are not mine.

I'm going to take it from the top in order of least to most impacting. I organized a group to play a Cypher campaign with, but they all ended up bailing at the last minute for one reason or another. Now, them bailing is not the problem as I am used to my social life being a bowl of corn flakes most of the time. The problem is the motherfuckers ***didn't even think to let me know*** until everyone was almost a half hour late. Just talk to me, people, not hard.

Secondly, I have been trying to get my Singer 15-91 rebuilt and I need a new motor and to rewire it with copper because it's still using the aluminium wire. I made contact with a gentleman who rebuilt those little motors. What I didn't know was he was 85. What I also didn't know was that his son would answer the phone when I called to arrange for the new motor in exchange for $100 and my old motor to let me know his dad is very dead. See, it wasn't age that got him, oh no. He also rode a motorcycle still and lost control and hit a tree. Yeah.

Third on this list is my job blows. I'm underpaid for what I'm doing when compared to like-jobs with like-qualifications in town. My numbers are solid and I keep my metrics up, customers enjoy interacting with me, and my team is awesome. The problem is management is a clusterfuck: our department manager just resigned while we're expanding our program; our old team manager got replaced because some new exec didn't like ""his focus"" which came after a conflict between focusing on keeping numbers high or overall customer satisfaction. We were on the side of satisfaction; and most of the good people on my team are getting better jobs due to this mess. My biggest problem, though, is the ""underpaid"" part. Daddy has goals. Daddy needs money to meet those goals.

The next item is my purchasing of a lemon. Picked up a Focus and it's got a bit of rust damage due to the salted, winter roads, but nothing I couldn't manage. Then the AC failed. In Texas. In the summer. Now the transmission is failing because the clutch packs are old and it keeps slipping trying to get from 1-2, then 2-3 gear. I checked the fluid when I picked it up; light pink with no metal shavings. Good to go as the transmission ran smooth. Fast-forward about a month and I'm slipping a gear trying to enter the highway. With the nature of Ford transmissions, I'm just gonna have it replaced instead of rebuilt. Costs about the same anymore anyways.

Finally, there's a wonderful young woman whose eye I had caught. She's perfectly flawed and just amazing. She brings the gentle, kindness out in me and is so sweet. And I fucked it up. Long story short, she went quiet for a few days after I sent her a lengthy message telling her how I felt and what I was after. I wanted to know if she felt like she fit the bill and that's when she fell silent. I agonized over if I had said too much or if I didn't say enough or if it was too soon and then five days had passed. I've never been caught in a position like this before and thought she'd ghosted, so I told her it had been lovely speaking with her, I'm sorry if I was too much, and said ""I guess this is goodbye"". The next day she sends me a long message apologizing and telling me how much she liked me and that she was scared about that, but that she hopes that I find what I'm looking for. Part of me already thinks I have. But she didn't say goodbye back and it read like she was wanting a response, so I did. Now I'm waiting, but I'm not hopeful. That kind of hope just isn't my nature.

So, in response to all of that, I am off work today. I had the PTO for it. I figured I am gonna take the day and call around to mechanics in town about having the transmission replaced as well as estimated cost and payment options; update my resume and start fielding that to try and find a new, better job; bug Reddit to keep my crippling loneliness at bay; probably go to Michael's or one of the other craft stores and get some knitting needles because I keep promising scarves to people for some reason; and I have laundry to do. Irresponsible taking a sick day, but making sure that I am productive with it.",10Jul2017,1
30,"Yesterday i drove up to the automated main gate of my spouse's work in north San Jose to pick him up as i have done for years.  Sometimes the gate is wide open.  Sometimes the gate is closed.  When it is closed, I wait for one of the trucks or a car to come out to go in.  Other people who are picking up their family and friends after work have to wait too, which leaves a trail of vehicles sticking out into and blocking the traffic on the street.  What can i say, it would be managed much differently if I ran it.  When one of the trucks comes out, the line of cars goes in.  It has been this way for the years that he has worked there.  

Since it was a heat advisory day, i didnt want him to have to walk across the large parking lot to the street.  So I left my work early in order to arrive at his work in time to be near the exit door when he came out.  This time as i drove up to the main gate, there was a car coming out and so i hurried to catch the gate before it closed.  

I was waiting for the the gate to reverse direction and open a little wider when a older Hispanic woman comes knocking at my vehicle window.  How many people wouldn't even roll down their window for someone they didn't know?  Not a smart thing to do ever people.  It is actually quite scarey there.  But i am conditioned and so i don't think and do.  Anyhow she rudely demands, ""What are you doing?""  I am not accustomed to kowtowing to complete strangers who don't introduce themselves to me as it is a great way of getting suckered into something dangerous or being robbed, especially at this particular business.  

So I drive in and park and after a minute i see her talking to someone in the parking lot.  The uncouth woman yells across the parking lot something i didn't hear.  I roll down my window and i hear her yelling, ""Are you picking someone up?""  I didnt answer as it was a rude question.  People are coming out the door getting in their cars and leaving.  The only reason why she would ask would be to find a way to attack my spouse.  I'm not going to dignify her manipulation with an answer.  Then as i am rolling up my window again, she says, ""Hope you suffocate.""  I kept my finger on the up button and didnt respond.  I have IBS and stress antagonizes it, so at that point i drove off to find a restroom.  

As my vehicle has been there picking him up for years, it was recognizable and she found my spouse anyway.  She lied to him and slandered me to his colleagues in the process.  She stated that i had spat on the ground and who knows what else.  This business has cameras everywhere.  I mean everywhere because they hire criminals, drug addicts, and alcoholics.  People ask my spouse why he is even there because he doesnt fall into any of those classifications.  You would think that someone who worked there would have the common sense to know that whatever they did would be on camera and if they claimed something about someone else, it would be on camera too.  Unless of course she could control the video which is exactly what she does there.  Gotta love those corrupt, unsavory,  unscrupulous people.  You can't buy real class, its a behavior.  

Anyhow, you would think that she would have the common sense to know that people come in to pick up their family at four.  She didnt.  And as assistant security director, it is her job to know.  You would think that she would have the common sense to know that you can't lock people in to a place of employment.  Walmart found that out.  For those who dont understand, he didn't have a vehicle so he couldn't trigger the pressure pad on the driveway and the pedestrian gate is always locked on Sundays, therefore no way to exit.  You would think that after years of coming to pick him up, she would have known my vehicle and that i was there to pick him up at the standard quitting time.  But she didn't and it is her job to know.  You would think that she would identify herself as a representative of the company, but she didn't.  You would think that a person wouldn't approach a total stranger in their vehicle in the middle of a driveway blocking others.  No accounting for lack of intelligence and common sense.  

She told my spouse that if i came on the property again, she would call the police just to be more of a thug than she already had been.  

My spouse is extremely shy.  And she embarrassed and humiliated him.  And he couldn't stop her, so he blamed me.  

For anyone trying to identify this business, it is the one with huge piles of trash everywhere in front and in back.  Blight and Fire Hazard.  

They can't get anyone to work there, i wonder why.

35,"Over the past few days, I was contacted by another redditor who wanted to know what I looked like since I had posted in an askreddit thread about how I look like this or that, not important. The point is, I originally posted the image to imgur, but there was overwhelming negative feedback due to me posting a ""selfie"" even though I was only using imgur for sharing purposes.
Anyway, I removed it from imgur, and since I had, others could no longer view it. So, one day, I got a request from a redditor through PM - he asked if I could see what I looked like, so I sent him a shareable Google drive link. I thought these links expired, but now, I'm not too sure.
On top of this, Google drive links contain meta data that I guess I hadn't noticed before, so now this guy knows my first and last name, as well as which state I live in. I'm absolutely terrified that he'll look me up somehow and find me and murder/rape me. I would be incredibly grateful for any help or advice in this situation.

41,"Today, I decided to use some of my grandmother's nail polish to paint my nail. Yes, one nail. I didn't know how complicated cleanup would be even with remover, so I just did one in case I wouldn't be able to easily get the polish off before my grandparents saw me later in the day. As a gay man, closeted from most of his family, who rarely gets to sport his feminine side, it felt so cool getting to paint my nail against my homophobic family's knowledge. Not implying that I think that you have to be gay to paint your nails as a man, but for me personally, this was me becoming more comfortable with myself despite my home situation. It looked god awful. I did two coatings, and both were sloppy as hell, but from a distance, it looked not bad, and I felt so liberating. I now just want to go out and just browse all the colors to find my color.

I'm definitely not a makeup person (on myself, on other people it's completely fine with me), but nail painting seemed appealing at some point today, so I just went for it.
