0,"As a child and a teen, I was always badly criticized by the man I should've actually been idolizing .. My biological father. He would criticize me about my weight/appearance  and say things such as ""you need to eat you're too skinny"" ""you're so skinny I'm going to pump some gas on you"" . And would always look at me in a disgusting way that I never even wanted to walk around him. I lost count of the numerous comments he would say about my weight. Now imagine being 12-19 years old going through the changes in your body as you turn into an adult and having someone criticize your weight and your appearance . It got so bad, I started wearing double pants to look bigger or never wear short sleeve shirts because my arms were so tiny. I never noticed my appearance until he started mentioning it. He also had a problem with my school work, my childhood friends, what I wore, and as I became a young adult the bullying became worst. He started calling me lazy, dumb, etc. I was working part time and going to school full time to get my bachelors yet I was called all these names. I have never heard this man say ""I love you"" ""I'm proud of you"". In 2015, decided to go back to get my masters to shut him up from all the years he called me lazy, dumb, etc. even with a masters he would say comments like ""you're useless"". There were days he would say something so hurtful I would run to my room and just cry. The only short conversations we ever had was about him wanting me to clean, my appearance, or money. Through the years of these negative Criticism I've finally learned to block it out but it sometimes still gets to me. He has a lot of medical issues so I will say I care for him but no longer have that love for him that I once had or that love I craved for as a child, I should say. I get anxiety just even being around him because I never know what negative comment he's going to say. I dont like being around him. I feel bad for him. I feel bad for him because now I think he's realizing that I am an adult and he tried to act (or maybe now he's actually showing) that he cares but I no longer do. He physically and emotionally drained me. I feel that at my age (late 20s) I am preparing very soon to leave my parents house but I'm secretly saving money to be comfortable on my own . The only reason I actually stayed this long was because of the wonderful relationship I have with my mother . I feel bad for him. I really do. Because one day he'll be in his bed dying and as much as it will hurt me because I cared ... It'll be a little of a relieve .. And I feel guilty for thinking this way... Should I be feeling this way about the man who raised me and is my biological father ?.",06Sep2017,3
1,"Last Friday I went out for a social thing with people from the office.

 
We spent the evening cracking jokes and having a good time over Chinese food and beers.


A lot of beers.

 
I ended up sitting next to a really attractive co-worker I hadn't spoken to that much before. Not enough to realize that she's truly singular and could make my cheeks sore from laughing, anyway.

 
Whether that feeling was mutual or not we ended up at her place that night. The portions of this story I shouldn't kiss and tell about were amazing, but so was talking about nothing through the small hours.

 
The next day the hang over was the only thing keeping me from spending my early Saturday shift at the office with a conspicuous smile on my face.

 
Little did I know she'd been walking around with one herself.

 
On Sunday she texted me. And some how we found ourselves in her apartment yet again late that evening. Another night that lasted into early next day.

 
I can't really say if I'm starting to fall in love or not -- and that has always been a 'when you see it you'll know' type of deal for me anyway. But thinking of her in the middle of the night and feeling the need to write something about it evokes a familiar feeling that I haven't run into in the near decade since my early twenties.

 
It's a feeling I haven't missed: The vulnerability of eagerly wanting to find out where a just few moresmall hours together would take you.

 
There hasn't been a text between us since shortly after I left her place on Monday -- I wrote last. And now she's on a northbound night train headed into a five day hike in radio silence. Myself, I'm spending the small hours awake and alone with a bunch of questions gnawing at me.

 
Did I blow it or was it just a two time thing to begin with? Should I play it cool and see if she finds the mood to talk to me or should I lose the pride and fire away another text? The list goes on and I'm sure you could fill in the blanks yourself.


I don't know the answers but am old enough to weather the worst of disappointments. But what I do know all to well is that the anticipation for a kiss that's all but guaranteed is a vicious form of suffering.


I had forgotten what that felt like.",06Sep2017,94
2,Started college recently and in my life I have had only  two real friends. One goes to a different college and the other is still in high school so I don't get to see them anymore. I have a few acquaints in my college but they have their own friends and are older than me and we don't really hang out. Most of the time I'm OK with being to myself but recently I have been missing my friends and feeling really alone without anyone. I tried making friends but I'm not the most social person out there so haven't had any luck making new friends.,06Sep2017,16
3,"For those of you unaware, earlier this year Reddit posted the [Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities](https://www.reddit.com/help/healthycommunities) which became effective as of April 17th of this year. People thought this would be good, it would bring about healthy change and no longer allow subreddit moderators to act without consequences. Unfortunately it has done nothing because these rules are not enforced.

There are some subreddits with mod teams that abuse their position and use it to control the information and what is posted. The best example of this would be the /r/news subreddit, which is also the subreddit that had the most extreme incident of mod abuse. You used to be able to use ceddit to see removed posts on subreddits, but because reddit made some changes, this is no longer possible. There have been many news articles that have been censored between the time of the Orlando shooting incident and today, but Reddit admins ignore this abuse of power. While looking up for information on this, there was an incident where a person contacted the moderators because their post was blocked from appearing, one of the moderators approved of it and allowed it to show up only to have it removed and be banned by another moderator later that day.

But let's shift the discussion off of /r/news and bring it around to another subreddit. How about /r/The_Donald for starters. If you deny it is full of toxicity, you either have never gone through the subreddit, or you are so far removed from reality that you don't know shit from Shinola. But yet the moderators are allowed to do as they please with no consequences. Reddit admins that I have spoken with have stated,

&gt; Our moderators are strictly volunteers and as such have a fairly wide latitude in how they behave. We don't step in unless they are breaking site wide rules or the mod guidelines.

Here is [Reddit's content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/) and again here are the [Moderator Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/help/healthycommunities). So just browsing through the subreddit, you can see plenty of filth but nothing is done about it because the mods themselves are involved in it. The only time the mods take action is when something they don't agree with is said. The two subreddits, /r/news and /r/The_Donald mod teams are equally terrible in their abuse of their power, it's just that one gets more attention because everyone always talks about it, where the other one is ignored and people just say, ""That's how it's always been, there's no reason to try to fix it.""

The saddest part with /r/news is that if something is able to get through the censorship wall, you can actually have discussions about the article and what it means. With /r/uncensorednews, you can honestly see just about every news story out there, but there's no chance of having a civil discussion because most of the people there are toxic as hell. Moderators don't care about this though unless it goes against their own personal views. But isn't that against the Moderator Guidelines?

According to the Moderator Guidelines, Clear, Concise, and Consistent Guidelines:

&gt; Healthy communities have agreed upon clear, concise, and consistent guidelines for participation. These guidelines are flexible enough to allow for some deviation and are updated when needed. Secret Guidelines aren’t fair to your users—transparency is important to the platform.

These would be their rules. Let's take a look at the rules of /r/news for a moment.

&gt; Your post will likely be removed if it:
&gt; 
&gt; is not news
&gt; 
&gt; is an opinion/analysis or advocacy piece.
&gt; 
&gt; primarily concerns politics.
&gt; 
&gt; has a title not taken from the article.
&gt; 
&gt; has a pay wall or steals content.
&gt; 
&gt; covers an already-submitted story.
&gt; 
&gt; violates reddit's site-wide rules, especially regarding personal info.

Some of these rules are in no way clear, concise, or handled in a consistent manner. 

Let's start off with the first one, ""is not news."" What is ""news"" to them, and how do they determine that? News is news, there shouldn't be someone deciding what is allowed and what isn't. If something is trash, it's going to fade away just like any other trash post.

Now for the second one, ""is an opinion/analysis or advocacy piece."" I can stand behind this, the news should be about informing people of what is going on, not about trying to only report certain information that you believe to be important. If a man is shot and killed, that seems like something we will see in the news. But if it's reported that a man was killed, but what isn't reported is that he had a knife and was chasing the person...that is important information that needs to be included so people can have all of the facts when discussing the incident. The news shouldn't be someones personal blog or soapbox.

Now for the third rule, ""primarily concerns politics."" This is the second most used excuse by mods to remove posts they don't agree with. I'm going to use an actual incident that occurred to explain this one. There was a group of Trump supporters who were met by protesters, and the protesters attacked the Trump supporters and there was a scuffle, and there were arrests made. This story was removed and the person banned because it was a story that ""primarily concerned politics."" Even the subreddit /r/politics removed it because it didn't meet their requirements as a political news article. During this time, /r/news would be filled with Pro-Clinton or Anti-Trump articles, but nothing of the opposite would be allowed. Trump supporters attacked removed, but if something happened to the protesters, it would be kept on there. So again, in what way is this rule clear, concise, or enforced consistently?

The next two rules of requiring the exact title and not allowing paid sites/sites stealing content are fine, I don't think anyone disagrees with this no matter where you stand.

Now for the MOST used rule that the moderators use to abuse their position. Your post will be removed if, ""covers an already-submitted story."" Now, before getting into this understand that I understand this rule, even their full explanation of this rule is something I agree with. The issue is when they see a news story they don't agree with, so they remove it. Someone comes along to also post that news article, they don't see it already posted, so they go ahead and do so...but it gets removed as ""already submitted."" They search the subreddit again, and it's nowhere to be found. If a news article is already submitted but you can't find it when you search for it, it means that it was removed. So it doesn't break their other rules, but they have a loophole to remove it by just saying it was already submitted, even though they won't allow the initial story. BUT! But the biggest question of all is what rule did the initial post break? What was wrong with the very first person to post that story that made it so it would not be allowed? Nothing, but it doesn't matter because they will just say it was already submitted and that's the end of it.

By Reddit admins own admission, they will not get involved unless ""the moderator is breaking site wide rules or the mod guidelines."" So when you have /r/The_Donald and /r/news in clear violation of them, why have the Reddit admins not done anything? These became effective back in April and they have done NOTHING. /r/fatpeoplehate was banned because of the crap they did there. An admin even said [We're banning behavior, not ideas.](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/cs21aj4/?st=j78bcnm6&amp;sh=8ea7a435) but it's the same thing happening today as it was two years ago. What is the difference between those subreddits and the current ""quarantined"" subreddits of today?

Reddit needs to enforce their rules as they claim they will instead of ignoring problems at every turn.",06Sep2017,1
4,"Made a throwaway for this.. Need a place to vent and not sure where to turn to, so here goes nothing.

It all started 2 years ago, when I was finally laid off for the winter for the first time. From that point on, a complete shitstorm has ensued. I started working for my father, in which I should have known better than to trust him, but I was in a pinch and needed some money. He made me a few promises, and as a business owner, I had expected him to keep his word. 

Long story short, he had me drive two hours away to work on this house. I had informed him I needed to pick up my son by 6 pm, as daycare closed at that time. He proceeded to send me anyway. His response, well you better get up there and,get the work done if you wanna be there on time. With much haste, I drove to the job, got pulled over, got a speeding ticket on the way there. Ended up getting the job done, but was over an hour late picking him up (which the daycare was not okay with), paid my late fee, and on my way.  I informed my dad of the ticket, ok ill pay it. Well, that trust bit me in the ass. Father proceeded to not pay the ticket and not pay me for the week, to which I was livid. ""Payroll issues"" was the excuse he gave me. Another week goes by, I work, no pay. I let one more week go by, because I cannot afford to not work and not get paid, not to mention its almost Christmas. What happens? No pay. So I make a huge fit about 3 weeks, no pay. He then proceeds to fire me. 3 days before Christmas. Not to mention he still didnt pay my ticket. So I scrape what I have together and make it work for my kids. It was extremely tough. I felt like a failure of a father that Christmas. 

Fast-forward 2 years. 

I continued to drive and got pulled over twice for driving while suspended. I had to get to work, right? Keep a roof over my head, feed my family... I still do not have my license situation figured out. Last time I checked, it was around $2,000 to get them back. To this day, I still do not have them. I simply cannot afford the extra $2,000, and my bills.

I am working, but over an hour away from home. I carpool with a buddy on my crew, but my boss just took me off of the crew I rode in with. Sometimes we get sent different locations. So now this job is in jeopardy. Our hours have been shit the last few weeks, and have not been able to get caught back up on bills. I tried the whole room mate thing, but wound up in even more debt, due to him bailing and not paying his share of the bills.  There arent any jobs close by that pay as well as this one, so switching jobs isn't exactly an option. I can't drive legally. My electricity is on disconnect, my landlord is about to kick me out. I am not sure how my internet is still on.  I have tried calling township trustee, but apparently $14/hour is too much to try to get any sort of assistance. Boss wont give a raise.. I am stuck between a rock and a hard place, with no one to ask for help... I don't want to be homeless! Not to mention, my kids! I work hard every day, and try my best to make things work. I wish I could obtain a secind job, but it is very difficult, as there arent enough hours in the day.  

So if you are still reading this, and have any sort of advice, woukd you mind sending some my way? I could really use some wisdom/support right now.... Anyone?",06Sep2017,5

have i asked? of course i did. i hate that i had to ask but i did it and people were shit at responding. they did not respond or pretended i didn't ask. fuck those people. don't be those people. those people who ghosted when i asked for help can all go get bent. fuck you.

anyway, stop being assholes and be nicer. some of us with shit lifes are the nice ones. we deserve to be treated like gold. we are not. fuck you.

you're a grown ass woman, not some snot nosed little kid. fuck you. if you can't realize everything i gave up so you can have a great life, treat me with respect and acknowledge me as a human being, or even a good person, you're gone from my life.

7,"I'm renting a room in an older woman's rooming house along with some other renters.  Up to now our interactions have been casual, it's mostly about rent payment, me asking where she keeps stuff that renters can access, she let me use her garage and driveway, so I'm appreciative.  She'll also move me to an office bed while her house will fill up soon due to some big business event in town soon.  So I get the sense she trusts me enough to be around.   I better be careful / respectful, not only because that's who I am but because she knows where I work.  Apparently my she and my employer do business together.  

Well this evening she came up to me in her nightgown and bathrobe and it the robe was hanging open.  She's an older woman, I'd say 70+ and doesn't have a great body but opportunity struck and I took advantage of it.   She came up to me seeking help with a tablet that froze asking if I knew how to reset it.   I told her to hold down the power button a few seconds.  As she did that, I looked down at the screen if it did anything but it didn't.  I suggested she hold it down more but she said she'd ask another rented for help.  As I was looking at the tablet screen, I also snuck a peek at her cleavage, although there wasn't much to see as I doubt she was wearing a bra and she's old so her breasts would be hanging down.  Still, I felt some wood developing.  I didn't get hard as there wasn't much to see.  

When she returned from upstairs and had received help from someone else, I asked her about something else.  This time we were face to face with more distance between us.  Stupid me, I must've let my eyes wander again and since we were face to face, she probably noticed that as her eyes were looking at me while we talked.   What an idiot I am!   I need to stay on her good side as housing is very limited in the small town and she can mess things up for me at work.

10,"I had an easier time finding someone when I was suffering from my depression and anxiety, when I had a rotten marriage and I was cheating on my wife, when I hated myself and the person I had become. When I was in the lowest part of my life and attempted suicide 3 different times, finding someone was never more than a simple question away.


Now, it's 2 years later. I'm divorced, I became the person I always knew I could be - happier than I've ever been, depression gone, no more anxiety attacks, and I'm a good person.

14,"This is kind of a follow up [this post I made on the CasualConversation subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/6y4wwy/tomorrow_is_the_first_day_of_school_in_my_county/) 

I wasn't sure if this post would fit in to the kind of conversations they try to have over there, so I posted it here instead. Hope that's fine.

If you don't feel like reading the linked post, then I'll provide a TL;DR: Yesterday was the first day of school for my county, I'm recently graduated so actually not going for once feels really strange, and although I ramble a lot in that post, I was unable to nail down what exactly I was feeling, or why.

Now, I think I've found some words I can attach to that feeling.

For the first time in my life, I am shown the insignificance of my existence. I know that sounds really doom &amp; gloom but that's not what I'm going for here. Let me explain.

I believe part of this is because most of the people I had lasting relationships with were in grades below me. My two closest friends were two grades below me, and my (now ex-) girlfriend of 2 years was one grade below me. I'll get in to why this matters later.

For the past 13 years, school has occupied most of my life, and those three people I mentioned had huge impacts on me. They're still going to school, having experiences there, meeting new people, etc, and I guess it just feels weird that that part of life is going on without me, totally indifferent to whether I was ever there or not. Bells will still ring, busses will still arrive, the hallways will still flood with people. Relationships will start and end, teachers will retire, diplomas will be received. It's just strange to observe that something that has been an important component of my life for so long has gone on, and will continue to go on, and I was merely a temporary part of it.

The entire point of me saying that is because I think this applies to how some people feel about life as a whole. It shows me that I really am just a single person in a world of billions. I am small and insignificant, and that's...weird to think about. When I die, the Earth will continue to rotate, indifferent to whether or not I ever lived.

Lately, I've been thinking about the difference between existing and living. I feel like I've just been existing throughout my short life. I just do what I need to do in order to survive and basically just exist. 

I hope by doing this, I'm taking my first step toward living. I believe living is more than just surviving life, it's enjoying life. I can't really encompass all that I think about living in words but I hope someone understands what I'm trying to  say. 

I think existing is just accomplishing the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. While truly living is accomplishing the whole triangle. 

Am I wrong? Is life only about existence? Or can people truly live? Sometimes, I feel like the world the way it is today is built only to exist and not to live.

16,"Just... no matter what.

I have social anxiety, had it since I was a kid (which initially passed as normal shyness for that age). Because I've had over 10 years to ""learn"" what to and not to do, I guess I've tried to conform to my social surroundings.

And this is not for my benefit. I don't want to be ""cool"", I don't want to be ""badass"" or any of that. I just want to be me... But unfortunately that's hard when that version of ""me"" is frowned upon. 

So I try to be talkative, even though my energy is spent. I try not to be a downer even though my life is truly a mess, because nobody wants to be around that (lack of) energy. But with that comes the consequence of being seen as something just as bad or worse. 

Everyone thinks I'm weird, no matter who or what. I'm trying to be in their presence, I'm trying to be happy for them... But instead I'm looked down upon even more than I feared. It's just unfair. I hate to say and sound like that, but I'm just tired. I'm so tired of trying for THEM-- again, this is not for me but for them, even though I've got my own crap to deal with, I'm still trying to think of them.

I went in wide-eyed and innocent, thinking the law was on my side. It's been about a year and a half now since I petitioned for the case. Despite what everyone said, this case is much more complicated than I originally thought. 

To me everything was clear cut. There were no gray areas. Boy was I wrong. Nothing is black and white in law. Everything is gray. 

Lawyers and judges aren't there to uphold the law. They are there to find loopholes around it. This may be naive of me, but I honestly thought that's how law and Justice worked. 

Now I know the truth. Now I understand why people fear cops when they see them (even if they've done nothing wrong).

A year and a half ago, I thought this court case would be the beginning of the beginning for me. It was supposed to be the first step to my life plan. It was supposed to free of people who tried so hard to kill my spirit, hope, and faith in the world. 

I was so foolish. All it's done is hammer the last nails on my coffin. Everyday I wake up thinking of it. I live, breathe, and eat it. It's the last thing I think about before I sleep when my body can't take being awake anymore. 

You want to meet the worst people in society? Search through the people who make, enforce, and defend the law. I'm sure You'll find a couple good eggs there, but they might be as naive and foolish as I was.

These people don't care what you've been through or if it's in accordance with the law. It doesn't even matter if it's humane. I'm not sure why they do what they do. It could be because of the money, but sometimes I feel like they secretly like it deep down. 

This whole ordeal breaks my heart. I just want to move on  and be at peace. But I have this sick feeling that no matter what the outcome-whether I win or lose-this case will always haunt me. ",06Sep2017,2
22,"In my experience, when I play video games or share my knowledge and/or advice on anything related to technology people always assume I am male. I have been referred to as ""he"" ""Sir"" ""lad"" ""gent"" just to name a few. 


I never correct these people, with the exception of guild members in the MMO I play, but I always muse upon it.


Regarding MMOs; a friend of mine tried to explain to me that it is always assumed that female characters are IRL males until proven otherwise. This thought really gets me down.


Edit: Here are some excerpts from my comments, to add clarity to my original post:


&gt; I've known of people be forced to ""prove"" they are female by speaking in voice chat. They said they were female, but were not believed.


&gt; I grew up with friends who played video games - most of them were girls. They all went on to study/work in industries like engineering/mathematics/astrophysics/etc. When studying Computer Science at uni 75% of my year were female. On the flipside, it's apt that you should mention make-up, as some of my male friends contour more expertly than the females I know - I've never tried that in my life and know nothing about make up.


&gt;I have also experienced my knowledge not being trusted because I am female; a co-worker would constantly dismiss my tech advice, and like some total cliché, if a male colleague gave the same advice it would be accepted, leaving me thinking ""but I just said that!""",06Sep2017,21
24,"Just need to get this out I guess. Might be graphic and triggering.

I was walking to my boyfriend's car to head to school when I heard someone yell. I looked in the direction of the yelling and saw a man hit the ground. Hard. The sound was extremely loud, almost like a gunshot, and he bounced back up pretty good. Jumped from the top floor of the apartment complex. 

I thought it was a dummy at first. My mind couldn't process that a human being had just slammed against the ground, that a human being's limbs could contort in the way that his had. It wasn't until I saw the blood start to pool from his head that I dropped my bag and ran over. A man a little ways away was yelling ""Oh my God, oh my God"". I told him to call 911 and checked for a pulse. None. It didn't even matter though, he was obviously gone. My boyfriend also called 911 and I started CPR. One of his eyes was open. He had brown eyes. 

Police got there and took over. I don't know why, but I started crying. I felt stupid crying - I'm a paramedic student and will have to see this stuff regularly. Guess I just didn't wake up this morning expecting to see a guy fall to his death. It also struck something with me, knowing that a man felt so hopeless and so much despair that he hurled himself from his balcony. 

He lived a few units down from me. Had a wife and young kids. And brown eyes. I can't get his eyes out of my head. 

**Edit:** Thank you so much everyone for the kind words. I appreciate it tons. ♡  

**Edit 2:** Back again to say a couple things. Firstly, thank you all from the bottom of my heart. I'm struggling with it - I keep seeing him hit the ground. I keep hearing his wife's screams. I'm going to see what's available in terms of help tomorrow. Your comments are so nice and have really helped me.

Secondly, I see some people referring to me as a hero and whatnot. I appreciate the sentiment, please don't think I don't, but I'm not a hero. I'm nowhere close to it. I didn't save him. I didn't comfort his family or bystanders. I performed CPR on a man who was already lost. I did nothing of significance. His wife will never look at me as a hero or anything of the sort. She will look at me and feel guilty for what I witnessed and be reminded of what she lost. 

Thanks a lot everyone. I'll try replying to some comments tomorrow - sorry if I can't reach everyone. Hope you all had a good day. ",06Sep2017,704
25,"Maybe I am too sensative. Why should I care what others feel when I am close if its no fault of my own? 

I am a man of darker skin. I work in downtown Boston. I live in Dorchester and I went to school in Arlington, MA. My 1st through 12th grade experience was in ""white america"". After school was spent with my friends of same race. Now that you know a bit about who I am let me get to what bothers me.

Anytime, day or night, I am walking behind a white person, they invoke a feeling villainy in me. They dont turn their heads all the way to see me or ""disolve the threat"" and say hello. That over the shoulder, might be the boogie man, back check always makes me feel like I have to get ahead of the person to make them feel safer, more secure. If I dont pass the person the feeling of making them feel uncomfortable grows. 

I cant just shut off this connection with my fellow humans. This desire to have everyone around me in a good a happy mood. I know I cant change the immediate space around me short of becoming a really good comedian. Do I have any business caring for the feelings of strangers?

32,"I legitimately feel like a fucking failure at 26. Despite having a job and not living at my parents anymore, I feel like I'm still just missing a bunch of things in my life that I thought I would be able to do by now. Like driving, I live in a big city with public transportation but I feel like a failure for not having my own car and not being confident enough to drive. I have my license but can't drive confidently. Shit, I don't feel confident in my own skin and lately just feel like crying. I just feel like there's a massive disconnect between how I saw myself 10 years ago and how I am now. Like I got in the car with my dad this morning to practice and I just couldn't go ten minutes before I realized once again that it's pointless for me to even practice because it's not like I'll ever need a car if I live where I live. I've been doing it for ten years on and off and still haven't made progress. It makes me feel like a massive bitch telling girls I don't have a car despite not even really needing one. I just want to be able to go to places other than those in my own city. 

I just really hate myself and who I am as a person because while I don't give up often, there are things I give up on at random times. I may just give up on driving. 

There's just a massive disconnect in my head that I can't seem to accept and it makes me absolutely miserable being 26 and not being able to meet my own expectations. I can't talk to my parents about this because they think I'm just over-reacting and acting like a teenager making up problems for myself. 

Edit: just to clear it up, the driving thing is just one thing. Mostly it's that my views of myself don't line up and I get times where I panic remembering that and how long that actual road is to make them more or less even out, if that makes sense. ",06Sep2017,8

I don't want to come to the office, and I can't afford to take days off because all of those around me are constantly taking off days.  No one would be left to actually do the work.  I find no solace at home, with a senior in high school who is going to need a lot of money from me very soon, money that doesn't exist.  I see happy couples out walking around, and i think of how dissatisfied I am with my married life.  She is normal.  She's not asking anything of me out of the ordinary, and much of this started before we were even married, 19 years ago.  I am depressed, and all I know right now is to go the gym and sleepwalk through another workout.

34,"So I had a friend back in 2015 which was girl. Me growing up from when I was a kid, was not used to talking to girls so it was hard meeting up with her. But after her settling with me, I got a crush on her. I never actually had an intention to date her but I loved her for whom she was loads. So me trying to convey how awesome she is and how lucky I am, made it sound a bit creepy. I also noticed that she is one of those girls that is not looking forward to someone dating them (which I can totally respect). So I accidentally have shown a side that was not supposed to be ever shown in the first place and now she thinks all I want from her is to date her rather than being friends. A year later, we haven't talked. I decided to get back to her and become friends with her again because I missed the friendship we had together back in 2015. I do know that I should go tell her that I miss the old days and that I never really had any intention to date her and be serious and honest about it. But the problems lies here, how am I gonna proceed with the friendship so it won't be as awkward later on. What should I do next? Should I keep talking about stuff and hang around? Should I tell her we should meet up sometime later? Should I contact her on the phone and work on school stuff together? Should I do fun activities with her?

I can get online anywhere. THAT is what I love the most. I can finally browse reddit at work because I am using my own internet connection. I used to browse reddit at work and use a different username, but decided to stop just to be extra safe. 

A couple of things I dont like about this particular portable wifi hotspot is that it is wifi-connectable only. I'd like to have an option to be able to connect other devices via an eithernet cable, but... not that big a deal I guess. Also... I have to charge this once a day, kind of like a smartphone. When you think about it... it is prettymuch like a cellphone... I guess it runs on the same system. 

ANother thing I like is that the display can display how many devices are connected to it. And I can limit how many devices that can connect to it.

It was dead silent everywhere. There was a very faint light that made me see that. I stayed still and once I noticed the knife move forward, I immediately ran to my bathroom and shut the door real loudly and I could remember someone trying to push the door and saying in a very hard voice ""I have the tools to open it, you have no where to go!"" I woke up quickly as a lightning and I was shivering like I've been dropped in a tub full of ice. I remember sleeping with my blanket covering me until my neck but I woke up to my blanket only covering my knees and downwards.

52,"I really wish there were more openly-gay, male pro-athletes. A very specific request I know. There are reportedly many gay male pro-athletes, but damn near every last one of them is heavily closeted. There are openly gay lesbians in practically every sport, because they honestly have a much easier time with regards to acceptance in that sort of environment. But an openly gay man in professional sports is still taboo.

This may seem relatively unimportant to some, but there is a longstanding belief in the collective mind of society that gay men don't play sports, aren't good at sports, and don't like sports. Some of course will say, ""you don't need high-profile gays in sports to like sports as a gay man"". That's true on the surface. I personally know a couple of gay guys, myself included, who enjoy playing and watching sports.

But much like women have been statistically leaning away from math/science professions, gay men have largely leaned away from sports. And similarly to the case of women and math/science, this stems largely from a lack of visible role models, societal influence/pressure and mainstream belief. The key difference is that unlike with women and science (which will take many more years to build a roster of role models and shift mainstream belief), gay male role models in sport could be solved tomorrow.

As I mentioned earlier, we already know there exist gay male pro-athletes, according to reports there are at least 7 in Premier League soccer alone. They're just all closeted. Of course, I don't want to diminish the difficulty and stress of being the first in your sport to come out. All eyes will be on you, there will inevitably be some very shallow prior fans who will fall out of admiration, and the news media would make a truly massive deal out of it. But all it takes is one person's bravery to encourage many more athletes to follow suit.

Large multinational corporations like Nike, Adidas, etc, which sponsor athletes across countless sports have already realized being pro-gay is highly profitable, so the fear of losing sponsors is hugely diminished. If anything, sponsors will be tripping over each other to promote openly gay athletes. And having some highly-visible gay male pro-athletes will do worlds of good to shift the public perception of ""gays don't play sports"", and will give gay youth fantastic role models to look up to.

One of my many regrets is that I didn't take baseball, or squash, or snowboarding as seriously as I could've in my youth, and because of it, I'm now too old to really ""be the change I want to see in the world"", as the saying goes. I know that when I was younger, I would've greatly appreciated some, hell, any, gay role models in sport that I could look up to and think,

&gt;""That guy has fought through the same battles of self-hatred, confusion, rejection, loneliness, and depression that I have, and he still managed to become a sporting legend. The least I can do is try my best and not let my orientation bring me down.""
