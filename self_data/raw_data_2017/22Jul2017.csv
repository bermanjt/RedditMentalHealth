Now is not the time to turn a cheek or hang your head in defeat.

Now is the time to change. To change yourself and to change the world.

It seems like every week there is another story on the news about how another person has taken their own life. A musician or actor that has most definitely been one if the reasons many people may have decided not to take their own.

 I for one have used both Chris Cornell's and Chester Bennington's music as a way to remind myself that somebody, ***anybody*** out there knows what I'm going through and wouldn't want me to harm myself.

Congratulations to me I guess. I'm still alive. But my heros aren't.

This needs to stop. This world needs to stop being so cruel and so cold that increasingly large numbers of people, most without millions of fans to write an article to memorialize them, are making the same choice every day.

And there is only one way to stop this. And that's us. You. Me.

I would like anyone who has read this to go through one avenue with me. A tool many use to make others feel alone and cold despite it being pushed as ""friendly.""

Social media.

Please go into your ""friends lists"" or lists of ""followers"" and don't be the person who never messeges them. The person who is only a click away, yet so distant. Tell them you love them and care about then and they are important. You just might save a life.",22Jul2017,3

8,"I've been amazed at folks who still support Trump, I don't care if your a Republican a Democrat or whatever, Trump is a traitor at worst and a complete moron at best. I feel the truth actually lies somewhere in the middle, either way Trump is bad for our country.

My Republican neighbor finally opened up to me that she can't stand Trump, that she's so upset that he's destroying her party and she said in 2018 if he's not gone she's voting straight democrat all the way down the ticket. Why?

Cause she feels Republicans need to put country first, before party and that its obvious Trump is bad for America.

10,"I have no idea if this is an appropriate sub, but the sidebar seems to suggest that just about anything goes. I don't know why, but I just feel like telling someone about this, and the few friends I have would think I'm weird if I tried to text them about it. I don't really care if anyone reads it or responds, I mostly just want to write it down for myself.

So anyway, I started off on a post on /r/rickandmorty that had something to do with Linkin Park and Chester Bennington's recent death, and there was a comment thread about Nine Inch Nails/Trent Reznor. Someone posted a link to the NIN wiki entry on the song La Mer; the wiki said something about the song being inspired by the Debussy piece of the same name, which I then opened on YouTube. Having heard the piece in the past but not remembering what it sounded like, I thought ""huh, is this the one that goes *dun dun dun duuuuunnnnnn duuunnnnnnnnnnn* with like French horns or whatever [since there were French horns playing at the time and I vaguely associated the piece I was thinking of with either Debussy or Saint-Saëns]?"" But after listening through most of the 24 minutes, I realized this was not that piece. 

I thought of the Saint-Saëns association and thought that I might be thinking of a part of the Carnival of the Animals, so I opened that on wikipedia and saw that it was summarized by section; I ctrl+f'd for ""horn"" and nothing came up, so I figured that couldn't be right either. 

Next, I fixated on the French horn idea, and started googling several variations of ""famous French horn music"", which eventually led me to a forum that mentioned several prominent examples of French horn-based movements, including Tchaikovsky's 5th symphony--namely the second movement--which was emphasized one of the most famous.

I proceeded to YouTube Tchaikovsky's 5th, second movement. At times it seemed to be ramping up toward the little motif that was stuck in my head, and while there was a similar motif about halfway through, it wasn't the one I was looking for. I went back to Google, this time opting for ""popular"" in place of ""famous"", and kept seeing Tchaikovsky's 5th, so I opened that on wikipedia, where my brain seized on the word ""motif"", which hadn't occurred to me until then; I began to incorporate that into my searches, still to no avail.

After several fruitless keyword variations, another idea came to me: I'll figure out what notes they are and search for that. So I pulled up a virtual keyboard and clicked until the notes sounded right, then tried several searches of ""A A D F# G F"" with keywords like ""motif"", ""French horn"", ""brass"", and ""famous"". Still nothing.

Exasperated, with Google having failed me, I turned to reddit. With its diverse userbase, surely someone will have heard and remember well enough the little snippet of music I can remember. I went to /r/tomt and sorted by new to get an idea of how active the sub was, and I saw a question just 3 minutes old that I could actually answer! Encouraged, I clicked the submit button and began formulating my post. 

First, I had to figure out how to relay my earworm to others; I googled ""record notes online"" and came to an online MIDI sequencer. I fumbled through it until I got [something remotely resembling the music in my head](http://onlinesequencer.net/543144), and I copied the link. As I was thinking of how to word my TOMT post, it occurred to me to mention that the piece reminded me of Christmas. Just like that, it hit me (I actually said this out loud, to myself, in an empty room): ""Oh, god damnit, it's the fucking Nutcracker, isn't it?""

I pulled up YouTube and searched for the Nutcracker, groaning internally at the 1.5-hour-plus videos before finding a ~20-minute one of just the suite. I opened it and skipped through with growing certainty, and sure enough, [there it was](https://youtu.be/M8J8urC_8Jw?t=966): that five-note motif that had eaten up over an hour. 

Feeling simultaneously victorious and defeated, I had to share my tribulations with someone. I wanted to text someone, but a) I didn't think I could articulate my frustration because 2) they wouldn't understand and they'd think I was weird and iii) I didn't really want to open a conversational can of worms because I have to work in what was 6 hours from then. 

Since reddit helped me--albeit indirectly--figure out the piece I was looking for, I thought reddit would also be a fitting place to tell my pointless story. I needed to find an appropriate sub to post to, thinking /r/TIFU but for innocuous crap that can't really be described as a fuck-up. I googled ""find a subreddit"" and came to /r/findareddit, but after searching for a while and not finding what I was looking for, I ended up using reddit's (terrible) search function to look for ""casual off my chest"", where I found a post from /r/self. I skimmed the sidebar and decided to post.

Another hour or so later, here I am finishing my poorly-thought-out, incoherent ramblings to a bunch of internet strangers who probably won't read past the first paragraph. At the end of it all, I'm left to wonder several things: what did I accomplish with all this? why did I stay up until 1 AM when I know I have to work at 6? why can't I do anything productive? when the fuck am I going to find time to clean before my lease is up? how am I going to move all my shit back home? why am I even still typing all of this when it's completely unrelated to the story I'll probably delete instead of posting because my insecurity knows no bounds? how have I only written a little over 5500 characters? how can people reach the character limit on a post? what the hell am I doing with my life? Et cetera. 

Anyway, if you've made it this far, I'm sorry to have wasted your time. But then again, if you've made it this far, you clearly value your time as little as I value mine, in which case perhaps we can commiserate. I'll probably just go find some new-to-me depressing subs and wallow in self-pity for the next few hours, because who needs sleep anyway?",22Jul2017,2

17,"Edit. obviously my best friend is dating the girl I talk about



So I broke up with my girlfriend of one and half years like two months ago. We had a long distance relationship going on for a while and I was simply getting bored with the relationship. Hanging out with her just wasn't fun anymore that's why I was sure that breaking up would be the right choice. Also, I'm 24 and it was my first real relationship and the first person I had real sex with so I guess I was also scared about missing out other girls or some bullshit.  
Well, the last few days have been rough and I have really missed her. In the last few months I was reminded of her everywhere. When Im in the supermarket, I see products she always used to buy, when I wear the clothes we bought together, Im reminded of her, when I cook freaking rice, Im reminded of her (guess what, she's Asian)  

Ok, from what I've heard one of my best friends (our grand parents are friends, our parents are friends and we know each other since birth) apparently started meeting up with her. I have no idea whether there is sexual stuff going on but I highly suspect it.  
Reasons why I believe it:  

1. I recently met my sister and she blurted out that they were ""dating"" but immediately corrected it to that they were only meeting up as friends or some shit (like oh shit, I wasn't supposed to say that)  

2. She was at his place last weekend and this weekend. They are on their way to a birthday party where we're all invited tonight. My best friend is actually sleeping at my place (I'll make sure to talk to him, no worries)

3. My best friend has been actively looking for a girl for a long time now

-&gt; Shit, typing that out, it almost seems obvious that there is something going on.

I obviously can't blame my buddy. He had a rough year going on because he got fired. Luckily he has a few new job offers right now, so he got that going for him but getting those was tough af and I also know that the year started out shitty for him.  
I also can't blame her. I dumped her and she moved on. My buddy is a cool guy with a freaking ripped body haha (so yeah, I would fuck him too if I was a chick)  

Anyways, I need to come back to my own feelings. As I already wrote, I broke up with her because I simply got bored in our relationship.. or so I thought. In the last few months (already before the breakup) I kinda felt that I got bored with everything in life. Going out with friends got boring, drinking got boring, smoking weed got boring, playing video games got boring, college always was boring, work is boring, weekdays are boring and weekends are boring.  
So yeah, I just feel a little depressed in general. So that whole shit got me thinking that I maybe got bored in my relationship because Im simply bored with everything. 

The bottom line is: I just want to spend time with her, I freaking miss her. But I also want my buddy to be happy although I couldn't ever imagine hanging out with him when he's dating the girl I apparently still love.  
Anyways, Ill talk to him today. IF he says that something is going on with them, I will try my best just to let it be. I guess that my ex also had a rough time this year and they both deserve to be happy. 

Maybe I just need to chill out a little and see if the fucking boredom goes away. But the general boredom just fucks me up, maybe I need to see a therapist and talk about the issue.  
 
It would surprise me if anyone actually read this whole thing but if you did: Good job! Im always open for some advice as I already know that I can't really trust my own judgment about the whole deal right now.

34,"I'm hoping to get a discussion with some people about this movie. I need to know why people Like it. I can see that it is a very beautiful film and why it is made the way it is. But even as someone, who typically likes movies that are not exactly mainstream that don't follow the repeated movie tropes and stereotypes, I can not for the life me understand why this movie deserves to be as reveared as it is. 

Spoiler section:

The parts I liked:

There are many great and unique asspects of this movie, such as; The plane scenes were phenomenal. From the beginning to the end, every seen that took places from a pilots perspective was really, really good. It was fresh and it was satisfying everything he shot someone down. 

The civilian boat, more specifically the old guy. I like him. He was good. 

The rest:

I can see why the direction was taken to not give the characters any depth, I get that this movie is about a circumstance and that it is supposed immerse you in a realistic environment that is supposed to take you out of your comfort zone my problem is that I can't be immersed if there it no one I can relate to or cling on to. I tried really hard to find something that interests me in the characters. I really wanted to like this movie. There'd no story or direction. I'm trying really hard not to sound shallow, but aside from the positive aspects I mentioned above, the movie was just boring. Why did they feel the need to show us the fucking boat explode 3 times. Why should I give a shit that one dude was actually the guy he was holding on to? Why did the time if day keep changing? I went in with the mind set that this movie is going to be different, I thought I knew what I was in for, but by God I just didn't get it.

35,"Currently, I want to become a musician. In my life it's my soul passion and seems to be all that can bring me happiness, making music and listening to the music that other people make. I'm sure a lot of people feel a similar way. Now, before this year I was quite a studious person yet something hit me a few months ago, making me realise that I would probably lead a happier life if I stuck and committed to my passion rather than being thoroughly involved in other hobbies that I'd been pushed into and other things which didn't make me feel too good. Personally, I found this liberating and it was nice to feel as though I had a sense of direction and maybe even purpose. I decided to set the entire summer aside for trying to create something for myself musically. I decided I'd write a lot more songs and work harder on the ones I was currently writing. However, it seems as though the more I wish to pursue this dream and the harder I push to commit to it, the less I can write and imagine. Every time I set aside time from my day to write a new song, or make something new- nothing seems to flow, it's like a permanent writing block despite how much I feel as though it is the only thing which can cheer me up. It's miserable knowing that I may be shitty at the one thing I am passionate about, which puts me further into the line of thought that maybe my passion will stay as just that; a dream. Nothing that I can base my life around and actually commit to. It really breaks my heart the very thought that I may have to live out an entire lifetime doing jobs and working on projects I don't feel as though I'm meant to be working on. Yet nothing I do can seem to help me. I know that not many people can go from cold, to writing a song which means something- yet I feel critical of everything I write and feel as though even if I did write something; it would amount to nothing in the end- which is quite a depressing way to look at it. Furthermore, I see all my friends making their music like it's easy to do, and gaining fans. And I almost feel like I could do the same, I feel like I have a lot to write about, yet I just can't get the words onto the page. I realise that this is probably a very lightweight issue in comparison to some of the things shared here, but this is a real weight on my life currently, and the 50/50 between a good and a bad day depends on whether I'm able to write something that I like. I find it ironic, that I am unable to write a personal song to save my life, yet can jot this all down as though it was nothing. I doubt anyone read this all, but if you did, thank you.",22Jul2017,4
