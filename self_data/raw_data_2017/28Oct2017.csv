1,"We dated for three years.  In that time I made countless sacrifices for us to make sure we worked out.  I moved away three months after we started dating.  It was only an hour and a half, but we were both still in school, meaning our schedule was at the mercy of our classes and family affairs.  Not once did we even question whether or not we would make it.  We knew that our love for each other would let us make it.  We only had weekends for each other, but it was a blessing that we had that much time.  I was so fucking happy just to be able to hold her close for just a few hours every two weeks instead of seeing her on my computer screen. We lived like this for three years, having summers together, only to spend the rest of our time apart.  

It was fucking rough.  But we made it work, because we both had a true and honest love for one another, and we were willing to sacrifice other things in life in order to make it work out in the end.  I even jokingly proposed to her with a piece of costume jewelry.  She accepted, and wore it wherever she went, knowing full well I was serious.

This year I figured would be no different.  She was finally leaving home and going off to her own school instead of commuting to community college every day.  I was excited for her, because she always hated living at home and just wanted to go out and make friends.  

Things felt kind of weird in the beginning.  She and I both got exponentially busier, and she opted to stay at her dorm with her new friends over coming and visiting me.  I offered to drive up to see her, which she refused, saying she wanted to bond with her roommates.  

I was hurt, but I understood.  I knew she had been looking forward to this for three years, and now she was finally living her dream.  

Contact began to fade, and we'd never seem to have our schedules align.  I missed her like crazy, and she felt the same, yet never wanted to visit or to have me visit her.

And then I got a text one morning.  All it said was ""I cant do this anymore.  Goodbye.""

That was it.  No phone call.  Not so much as an explanation.  We texted once more after that.  She said she wanted to go out and have a fun college experience.  To meet new people.  To not be tied down.  To not have to worry about hurting me.  I think you know what I'm inferring.

I was fucking devastated.  


And here I am, 3 three weeks after she left, only getting worse.  In the beginning I was able to push the thoughts aside, able to bury myself in school work just to divert the attention from her.  But it's been getting progressively worse.  I'm thinking more and more about how she just up and left me without a care in the world. She knows how fragile of a person I am and still, after three years of nearly perfect love, just threw me to the side.  I'm sobbing right now, trying to find the strength not to text her and spill my feelings out.  She has absolutely no remorse for what she did, and is out there having more fun than she can handle while I sit here and cry each night.

I have absolutely nobody to talk to.  No friends I'm close enough with to share with them whats going on.  Everyone I know has mentioned how out of it I seem.  And I playfully shrug it off, telling them how I didnt sleep or was up studying for an exam.

I'm losing weight.  I can't sleep.  I can't focus on anything.  

I just can't do it anymore",28Oct2017,2

3,"I’m not sure where to start, so I will start with a missing story from the account of my trial.  This story is not missing by conscious choice but simply because I forgot it when I wrote the account of my trial. I was living in abject poverty in San Francisco, CA – Tenderloin neighborhood and Marijuana was legalized.  I performed my civic duties and started smoking copious amounts of pot every day. Just remember, the purpose of drugs is to alter your consciousness so that you may get closer to God. God is on another plain from the “real” world we function in. So, some of you may know where I’m going with this : ). Well, Anyway, I was having the happiest year of my life, all of a sudden everything was so much easier.  I could stand up for myself without internalized censor, I could recognize the truth without self-doubt, my relationships were more fulfilling because they were more honest, I met challenges with enthusiasm, I went for long and passionate walks – it felt like the whole world was mine.  Then Donald Trump got elected President. (Now wait, this is just the beginning of a very long writing.) I became overwhelmed by passion and purpose to oppose his Presidency.  Then after a series of events God called me to go on my mission, well God has given me many choices and the very first was the choice of a saint to patronage. I chose Kurt Cobain. There are many saints, besides the ones recognized by the Catholic Church, and further still, I am not Catholic, I’m Southern Baptist. This was the conversation:
God/Me: “I want you to pick a saint for your mission.”
Me: “Ummm, not Catholic, but ummm, Kurt Cobain.”
God/Me: “Are you sure, can you even pick him as a saint? What are saints? What is this thing I’m doing? Am I on Crack?”
Me: “Yep, Kurt Cobain, yup.”
God/Me: “He committed suicide…blah, blah, blah, something or another.”
Me: “Look, I don’t care, you told me I could pick, I x with Cobain. I understand him, I trust him, we’re rolling on this; put him in, final answer.”

(This is the actual truth) I heard music, ironically not the music of Nirvana, keep up guys not EVERYTHING is so literal OK? Good. So Kurt Cobain, activated patron saint of ………… (Undetermined-I think someone else makes this determination at a later date, anyway)
But as I’ve written, I don’t know what saints do because that’s firmly Catholic stuff- I’m actually deeply creeped out by the Catholic church. Pope’s creep me out, that weird pointy hat especially creeps me out. I had a Catholic friend, I didn’t under Saint Prayer Cards, creepy. I’m just going to fast forward this a bit, I sometimes envision a giant Kurt Cobain, he doesn’t talk, but he always puts his hand on my head and it’s very comforting. Now, I tell you that because that is pure fantasy but it is also equally factually true. 
Why is this important? Well, here’s the thing, apparently smoking weed can induce psychosis, which means you’re existing in an altered state within the “real” world. In my altered state, God is in my head. At the onset of the mission, God spoke to me and knocked me out. I went mad. So I said to God, look this mission you’re sending me on requires me to function in the very “real” world, I cannot be crazy and successfully complete this mission.  God was like, “You don’t know what you’re doing! You’re going to need me!” God inside mode activated. This was particularly challenging for me, dualism is hard on the nervous system. What I learned was God does not understand humans. Rationally, God is a macro thinker and humans are micro thinkers. Many of our dialogues went as follows, “Your purpose now is to go complete this task, do it, do it now, why are you mucking this thing up?” I would say, “God! Jeezow creator, I can’t teleport. I walk 4 miles per hour and I need to at least eat a hot dog at some point, plus, this d-g is being a total b, beaucracy amirite?”  Then God would be like: “OH. That’s how that works?” I would get confused, “Like, didn’t you know that already?” Creator would be like, “NO, hey, I’m curious about this other thing, why don’t you go do it and let’s learn some more.” And I would be like, umm but the mission. God would be like, “You ain’t ready kid no way and while I’m here I might as well have some fun.” 
Well, there were a series of events, some supernatural that occurred that I haven’t spoken of since or will now that led to my ascension (?) from judge to my current Christ. I’m currently on the B side of my A mission and I asked God to give me my mind back because the mission is delicate and very “real”.  So back to giant Kurt Cobain. Well, he’s dead yes but he’s not immaterial. Like I said, I died, but I wasn’t nothing while dead. My understanding of Catholic belief on saints is they were living human beings who desired and seek to experience Jesus Christ, or specifically, Jesus’ experience of life or maybe definitively his experience of The Passion. So, Catholicism states those who achieve this experiences stigmata’s and/or favor by God. Therefore in death, saints are gathered together and allowed to be in the presence of God for the direct purpose of bridging the gap of understanding God has for humans and of course humans have of God.  So now when I don’t understand something about God I commune with Kurt Cobain, we are in fellowship. (That’s the important part. I know there’s these really famous and long standing saints but in ignorance of these others I chose someone I had fellowship with.) 
Now, ok that’s cool and all right but what is the true purpose of the story you may be asking yourself? Well, this is the stand, how do you stand, the truth. So, if the true purpose of saints is to bridge the differences created by us existing in different realms then it A) explains why there are so many saints AKA martyrs and B) that the Catholic Church has corrupted the concept. (I’m choosing the word corrupt, but, I don’t mean any negative connotation just wait I’m getting there.)
What I’m getting at is that the formation of the church (All organized religion) by function is about control. Not necessarily for evil intent but anyone who has ever tried to get a large number of people to do anything knows perfectly well without some element of formalize instruction or standardizing of behavior nothing productive is accomplished. So, the story goes, there were many nations following many belief systems but God selected Hebrews, the nation of Israel amongst them all to be creator’s people. Well fast forward, God sent in Jesus and all hell breaks loose. The Jewish people lose their ever loving minds, get their savior (either directly or indirectly) crucified and hence forth Christianity explodes overcoming most religions before it and continuing to this day to needle its progenitor Judaism. Judaism survives however its institution is irrevocably altered, its Holy Land in turmoil, temple burned, its original hierarchical system lost forever (bye Shehedrin) and so too its favor with the Lord. 
So, what did Jesus do that was so revolutionary to change the whole world order as it was at that time? Jesus told the Jews to do the right thing. Religion has a lot of functions in human society besides glorifying God. For example, a tremendous reason for the structure of the Catholic Church is to correct a serious societal problem at the time of its formation.  Apparently, only first sons were allowed to inherit property, therefore second sons and so forth, bitter at the loss or potential loss of status and fortune would wage bloody territorial disputes that destabilized and terrorized the region.  [Look I’m Baptist, there’s a reverend, a deacon and a choir anything past that I don’t know.] So you see, there were multiple conditions met by the various idiosyncrasies of the leadership structure and administration of that particular religion. Let’s check it off the list, many leadership positions, vows of celibacy of the clergy, a need for leaders to be highly educated, high status attached to these positons and a head leader whose authority is unquestioned (that’s the most important part) because it is assumed to be directly from God. All the criteria needed to resolve many of the social problems of the age and thrive in such violent times. Now, in my life I have asked my Catholic friend, “What is the purpose of the Pope? Why do you need him?”  I was told he talks to God. I responded to her answer, “Can’t you do that yourself? If not why?” Her answer was, (this is the problem with religion in practice) was because that is the way it is done.  The real answer of course, just like giant Kurt Cobain’s giant hand on my relatively tiny head is because it’s comforting. Which is actually okay, as long as you understand it’s a symbolic gesture. I didn’t previously understand that people didn’t understand this about religion. 
Ok, so let’s go a little further, The Bible is corrupted too. No one knows apparently the authors of The Old Testament at all and The New Testament is written by men, who may or may not be who they claim, but most certainly wrote their books 10-30 years after the events of Jesus Christ’s crucifixion, it’s debatable if they even witnessed or had access to the players involved and is widely accepted fashioned the tone, conflict and antagonist to facilitate or pacify the populations or persecutors at the time they authored their books. I just learned, apparently Mary Magdalene technically should have a book in The Bible because Jesus gave her secret teachings but the other “official 12” rejected her addition. Maybe, only I am playing catch up on this one, but, Christians were persecuted and well martyred at exceptional numbers. In fact the Rohingya region of Myanmar are the latest recipients of this particular legacy. Nearly, all New Testament authors, and followers of Christ of the age were killed horribly in most cases and murdered in the name of their faith.  So understand me completely, when I say The Bible is corrupted I do not imply evil intent. I mean to say, you should recognize, the accounts of Christ’s Passion from the four authors changes the accounts of the same event. Hint Hint. Remember, the majority of Christians, because the majority of all citizens at the time these books were written were illiterate. The Bible’s authors are tipping their hand to the readers of the future. We are all in fellowship and we are all working towards the future.

Well instantly she is a different person, kind of a full switch. I guess it's a behind a screen kind of thing, attempts at dates got cancelled. So I just started talking to her in messages, and things were going ok. Four days later she adds me on Facebook Andy tells me her phone was disconnected. I asked her out again getting but we decided to just do a skype call in our pajamas. To be honest that skype call was the first time I've felt happy in a long time, it's been a tough year. So last Sunday we were messaging and she just vanished. Like she sent me a message, I was out and forgot my phone at home. I missed a message by 30 minutes and replied to it. It's now been 5 days since she was active on anything I have her on. I kind of suspect it was a scam and she found out I was a broke kid and decided to just drop me. I mean this girl was super out of my league. On the other hand, she said her phone was off because her sister was mad. Did somthing happen to her? I mean, if it was a scam did she scam the wrong guy and he has her killed or tied up somewhere? What if she got hurt in accident? Another person on her Facebook posted asking where she's gone. Am I stuck on the limbo Facebook page where the rejects go? Or is she in legitimate trouble?

Oh yeah, my friend from school asked me to be her roommate, and I did all this work setting up viewings, getting applications, handing them in, getting accepted, and the day after we agreed to this sick apartment with a dishwasher, a balcony, tons of closet space and pretty cheap rent for the area, she bailed on me.

I was starting to really enjoy working there, even if my client base wasn’t super high. All of my clients really liked my treatments, but I’m not experienced enough, and I guess I’m not of the same caliber as the other therapists. I could have been, given enough time... 

I just hope this new place is more to my interest... and at least I can actually study this week and use my roommate as a test dummy for my practical exam.

27,"Hey all, throwaway account because of reasons. 

Background story: I am in my twenties and have a lot of friends, generally people like me. In fact I don't think there are any people who actively dislike me. For some reason I am very altruistic and most of the time put other people's interest before mine.

That said: Never in my life have I been in love. I sure liked some girls more than others, but there were always small things that annoyed me about them and I was pretty sure that I could never be in a relationship. 

Then a few weeks ago I met this girl that studies at the same University as I do. Never met someone I connected to that intensively. There's something about her that's hard to explain, but I am extremely attracted to it. Let's call it charisma. I was nervous as fuck, but when I asked her for her phone number she gave it to me. Fast forward a few days, we have been texting quite a bit, I grew even more and more attracted to her. Then the day after I've seen her at a party I finally decided to ask her out on a date. She agreed, I gave her a hug and for the rest of that day I was feeling like the lord of all creation.

To make things short: She's perfect in my eyes and for the first time in my life I wanted to be with someone. Not because I wanted to be in a relationship, but because I wanted to be in a relationship with **her**.

Yesterday I texted her again, asking what day she wanted to meet for the date. She wrote that she still wanted to meet. However she also wanted to ""warn"" me that she currently is not looking for ""something like dating"" at this point so that I don't make myself false hopes. (hope that makes sense, english is not my native language). I asked her what exactly she meant with ""something like dating"" and although she did not say it directly, she meant being in a relationship. 

So now I have a date with the girl of my dreams on wednesday and I know it will also be the last one. I don't know what I'm going to do because she has been on my mind 24/7, we are going to see each other at least twice a week at the University and knowing myself this will probably drive me insane.

Thanks for reading strangers, although I do not expect that someone will be able to comfort me, I still needed this to vent. I'm probably going to cry in bed tonight.",28Oct2017,0
28,"In bumping a clean spoon off the drying rack and hearing it clatter on the floor, I thought, ""I should slit my wrists."" I didn't think it consciously, not as far as I can tell. It came up like you'd say ""ouch"" after stubbing your toe. 

I have devoted the time of my days to simultaneously minimizing my presence and molding myself into a perfect support for those around me. Left to my own devices, I become inert. Like a robot powering down, all tasks complete. I enter a state of nothingness because there is nothing to throw myself against. I mindlessly watch videos or consume books or movies. 

I'm nothing. I absorb things around me - stories, ideas, words, gestures. In trying to share, I'm only mimicking something I saw before, aping someone else's thoughts. So why bother being surprised when everyone else says, ""sure, been there, done that""? Nothing is new. Nothing I do will ever be an exception and I certainly am not exceptional. 

In doing something small - tidying dishes - when I fail in some way - dropping a spoon - this creates the sudden, profound and unshakeable feeling that I have failed completely. As a person, as a human, as myself. So: I think about slitting my wrists. 

I have the same reaction to other things, too. Especially feeling “not good enough”, which is basically always. Obsessed with my flaws and failures, I am always picking at my nails, my skin, my body, and finding new and unusual ways to criticize my own behaviour. I’m always struck by the ol’ double whammy: why bother killing yourself when no one cares? Why bother living when nothing you do matters?

I feel some solid footing when facing someone else. It gives me a mirror to see my own reflection. It shows that I exist, in some small way. So I've turned outward, facing someone new. In all small ways, I think I'm creating some show of support, of teamwork, partnership. The invisible movements of objects around the house when I tidy. The ritual of cooking. The pseudo-martyred motions of doing chores for someone else then feeling somehow slighted when they go unrecognized. 

Sometimes I wish I could just shut up and live without all this drama. Everything has to be some sort of spectacular display of commitment, adoration, or best of all, disappointment (the 70% dark chocolate of criticism). Can't we just “be cool” for a while? 

Sure, we could just slip into the quiet nothingness of co-existence. Take for granted the invisible movement of objects around the house because we can live without them. They are small but ultimately unnecessary quality of life improvements. Face in every direction but each other, because we are all just characters in a book with no author. Why bother making a promise you can't keep?

What is my role in all this? I can't tell. I am blindfolded to my own shortcomings because I am so absorbed in peeling away my own scabs from never-closing wounds that I’ve inflicted on myself. Am I a martyr or attempting to assert some form of self-respect? And would I even be able to tell the difference? 

In the meantime, I'll continue contorting myself into twisted shapes, trying to fill a void that has no definition. If I just keep striving to be a better partner, eventually I'll be recognized, right? Eventually someone will point to me and award some trophy. A ticker-tape parade in my honour. ""Best partner who never complained and was fine with everything and never had any feelings"" of the year. 

But don't talk about marriage. Again, I ask, why bother making a promise you can't keep? 

And anyway, my own secret preoccupation with marriage is a C- on my Good Partner Report Card. It's just another blemish I pick at on my long list of self-critiques. But I stick my fingers in the wound sometimes, just to wiggle around a bit and see if it still hurts. Boy, does it ever. A reminder that I'm Not Good Enough (Yet)™ but, you know, if I just worked a little harder, acted a little differently, was just a little better - but in an inscrutable way, a way we don't talk about - if I could do those things, then I'd win the real prize. 

The real prize: a life of further squishing myself into a shape I recognize less and less. Staring into a mirror that will never show a reflection of myself, only someone I want be and never will be. A lifetime of facing that impossible question: ""what do you want?""

Simple: I want someone to care about me as much as I care about them. Impossible: I want to believe them. 

So I drop the spoon on the floor. And I consider - but only for a moment - slitting my wrists. Then I go back to doing the dishes, pretending like nothing ever happened.",28Oct2017,7

It's paradoxical, because I have always seen myself as a ""deep"" person, but recently I've been seeing the truth behind my possibly dishonest self-image.

I think this is strange at such a young age by the way; it kind of creeps me out, and the sort of brutal truth that came from that moment has haunted me ever since I remembered it a few years ago. I had decided right then and there at age 8 that ""People are truly living, until the age of 25, and after that, for the rest of their lives, they're dying.""

I felt smoking hot during my prime years, which I consider to be roughly age 17 to 23, and when all of that drug addiction came to pass (same timeline) I realized I was now soon to be in my thirties, and my youth was gone. So naturally I start to think that I'm noticing this because I used drugs and ""wasted"" those years by being emotionally sick and thwarted, and didn't notice the time going by, causing me to now look in the mirror and not recognize my reflection. But a part of me wonders if I am just a superficial, shallow person. Some days, if I find myself to be particularly ugly, it will consume me and, though I can force myself to let it go, I can tell it ruins the rest of my day, as my mood never fully recovers. It's embarrassing and shameful to me that I can't seem to shake this. But the worst part is that I project this onto others, especially other women. I find myself looking through Facebook pictures (just last night) of people I added from groups, thinking ""Her husband looks younger than her. He probably doesn't want her at all sexually anymore. He probably misses when she was young, like in her past profile pics"" and when I see 60-something ladies I think about how their husbands must be stuck in a sexless prison, having had their beautiful bride turn into an old, lumpy, frumpy, unattractive lump. I know, it's horrible. It doesn't help that my mother-in-law once alluded to the fact that there is no more sex in her marriage (she's in her sixties but it might be that it's been going on for a while, not sure), and that ""it's nice to have the memories"" which is so depressing to me, especially since my sex drive is higher than my husband's already. I Also have been analyzing my own behavior and thoughts when it comes to in-person interactions, and I've come to the conclusion that I seem to have a greater respect for women who are pretty or look fairly youthful. Older looking ladies bore me to death, no pun intended. Also, I like to watch Intervention sometimes, and I find myself only watching the episodes where the subject is a pretty young girl. It's like I don't have as much sympathy for the others or I can't relate, or I just don't want to try. I want to state that when it comes to the opposite sex, I am actually sort of the opposite. I am more attracted to older men and I see younger men as prone to being annoying and immature, but I don't know if that's because of my own insecurities about my physical beauty.

TLDR version: My life is great on the outside, but inside I am consumed with insecurity about impending aging, and I am worried this is a sign that I'm a shallow, superficial person who places way too much importance on beauty and youth. I want to break this cycle but I don't know how to without finding myself beautiful, which I don't anymore.",28Oct2017,4
35,"[Just a post where I vent, not really looking for advice or anything, it's just been on my mind a lot].

Throwaway, first post, blah blah.

I used to go to a school a few hundred miles away before I moved to where I am now nearly two years ago. 

When this happened, I had been 12 for like three weeks and it happened at my old school. I'm nearly 14 now.

It was a normal lunchtime, me and my friends used to use the toilets in the maths department because they were always the cleanest ones. I popped in there and when I got in there, I heard moving around in one of the cubicles. 

I used the toilet and went to wash my hands. After I had finished, I noticed that no sound was coming from the only other closed cubicle in there. I didn't think much of it, kids like to hide in the toilets to use their phones (because they're not allowed) and left.

About ten minutes later, one of my classmates ran up to me and my small group and said:

""Someone's killed themselves! Look around here, there are ambulances.""

We didn't believe her at first, but then she lead us to the front of the school, where two ambulances were parked in the car park. Two more were parked at the side of the school. Nobody (including me) knew where this had happened because teachers weren't saying, and at this point, it was still more of a rumor than a fact. Maybe someone just had a broken leg or something, I thought.

We didn't find out that day what was  happening. We found out the next morning when we were all called in for an assembly. That was when the head teacher confirmed that someone from the oldest year group in the school (I was the youngest) has killed themselves and that we won't have any lessons for the next two days. 

I hadn't even heard of this person before, they were four years older than me. We were all shocked and upset, though, and like our head teacher said, we spent the next two school days doing colouring in our tutor rooms and taking it in turns in our classes to write goodbye notes for a temporary memorial room.

A few days later, my parents got a phone call saying that the police wanted to interview me at school the next day. At the interview, they said they saw me on CCTV using the toilets the day it happened and that the girl who killed herself was in the other cubicle. She hung herself.

I recalled to them what I said earlier on, how one cubicle was shut and there was no noise or anything. They let me go back to class and everyone was asking me why I was pulled out of class, but I kept my mouth shut. 

They sealed the door to the toilets with a massive sheet of wood.

For the next few weeks, I felt like I could hear a voice in my head talking to me. I have no idea how else to explain it, but it felt like there was someone else there making up the words for me, even though I was thinking them. After school every day, I felt like I was being followed by someone or something on my way home. It took me at least a month for my brain to filter the voices out and I stopped feeling like someone was right behind me after a while, but I'm sure it was related to this, because I never had anything like that before and it started the day after that interview. I felt like I was going crazy.

A week after that, I moved away.

I just feel like I could have done something to help her, if I knew she was there. If I'd walked a little faster to the toilet, I might have seen her go in and asked if she was OK. But I couldn't. But I still feel guilty.

She was her parents' only child. I feel like I've taken everything from them and it was all my fault.

After two years, I still wake up every morning feeling like shit because the reason someone's dead is because of something I did - whether it was my fault I did it or not. I want to cry on a daily basis, but I just hold it in because I've moved now and nobody I talk to now knows anything about any of this. 

A few of my old friends use Reddit, so I hope they don't see this. Partly why I used a throwaway. And if that girl's parents are reading this, I am so, so sorry.",28Oct2017,130

38,"I've always been like this. Any word of rudeness gets me down for days, I will keep thinking about it for months to come and I can't seem to snap out of it.

There was a professor at college that was a major bitch to me, and even now, almost a year later, I still caught myself thinking about the awful way she treated me. Last week someone called me out on a small facebook group, claiming I did something which I never did. I felt disrespected and humiliated, and even though I could prove I never did what he claimed, he still insisted and didn't apologized. I feel like I am so careful in what I say and write so I won't hurt anyone's feelings, but people don't do the same when speaking to me. I feel like a doormat, like people don't respect me at all.

And it's not just rudeness either. I'm a big animal lover, and I'm very sensible to anything related to cruelty against animals. Hell, if I can avoid it I don't even kill bugs, and if I do I feel terrible about it, the thought that I just ended the life of a creature makes me feel awful. Once a baby house gecko died on my bedroom window, and the sight of its tiny body stuck on it resulted in me locking myself in the bathroom and crying for over half an hour. 

Yesterday I watched two episodes of that Blue Planet documentary. I felt like Phoebe in that episode of Friends where she just skips the bad parts of a kids movie with Ben. I skipped all the parts that had killer whales, because I just can't deal with that anymore. I used to love watching animal shows as a kid, and even though I also hated the parts where a predator killed a prey, I still watched it (though once I cried about it, but it was a very specific documentary). I didn't fast forward enough tough, and I got to see a dead baby whale the very dramatic narrating, saying how the mother took care of it for so long, and the killer whales took 6 hours to kill it. Just typing this makes me sick to my stomach. I keep thinking about that, and I can't forget it. It's so sad.

I'm so tired of being like this, of worrying so much about everything, being such a doormat. I wish I could be like those people who just don't give a fuck. If there was a way to turn it off I would. ",28Oct2017,2
40,"This is an 8 paragraph post. Sorry in advance but I want to get this out.

So yeah, before I finally tell someone this I know it was incredibly stupid. It was through Facebook and this person who I didn't know sent me a friend request. I saw all the red flags....no recent posts....only a few pictures...etc. 

So we ""she"" messaged me and just said hi. At the time, I was stoned and I thought I would play along. She asked me all these questions like what do I do. What do I like to do in my free time. How old I am. Eventually she asked me if I like sex, which I told her I'm still a virgin. Which is true. And by the way, this person was clearly not Amercian I got. Said she was from Texas, but was wanting me to meet her at her house. To which I said no. Then she asked me for my phone number to which I also said no. 

Then, she asked me if I was willing to ""make love over CAM"". At this point the power of boners took me over and I caved in and said sure. In my mind I thought nothing could go wrong and that this was just a spontaneous thing happening. So yeah, I was jerking in front of my phone for a good 10 minutes or so with this girl like really didn't look like the girl from Facebook. She asked me to show me face, which I did unfortunately. Then out of the blue the video stopped and she or he started messaging me saying to listen to every word that they say and to no block them or go to the police or they were going to put that video of me up on YouTube or Facebook or send it to my friends which they showed me their names.

I started to freak out a bit, but I kept telling myself I'll work this out somehow. I originally thought it was just some girl trying to show the internet how much of pigs men are. This person kept threatening me that they would share these videos unless I did exactly what they said. This went one for like 10 minutes until they finally said they wanted me to give them $5000. Told them I have no where near that much money since I go to college and work a part time job. 

So then I started to take action. I screenshot half of our conversation on Facebook to show what happened before the video. I told them that I had the pictures of our conversation and I guess that person blocked me or deleted their account because I couldn't see any of their responses on Messenger or their profile picture. Wouldn't even show me their profile.

I figured it was over, until they started to text me with more threats. But it was all the same bullshit and I started to think that this piece of shit was trying to blackmail. So I screenshot all the texts we had and started to tell him that what he's trying to do was illegal and if he did upload anything that id fight back. The person said I was be fighting back to the police because they were going to turn them into the police and get me thrown in prison liken the other 6 or 7 people she got. They made up some story about all these people. Got the feeling that this person lives in France because they used a lot of French terms or places around there. Like they said they would send me stuff to the federeaux? 

I told them that I was done stressing about the situation and that id rather have them share that video than be blackmailed by someone like them. I blocked their number and deactivated my Facebook account (the whole scenario was the last straw for Facebook with me). I unblocked the number this morning to see if they were still saying shit to me, but nothing so far. 

Sorry this is so long but I wanted to paint the clearest picture for you guys. I've read this is a pretty common scam here. I just want some advice or any other stories to help me try to forget about this. It's just a little violating to know people do this shit. Also to have reassurance that I've done nothing wrong and that I have the tools to win this fight if it comes to it. Cause honestly if people do see the video than that's just a reason for me to get this guy pegged for his bullshit.",28Oct2017,2
43,"Sometimes little things remind me of her, or the times we've spent together. I can't do basic tasks like go to Starbucks, or eat brownies, walk through a park, or even lie in bed at night without her crossing my mind. Most days I ignore it. Other days I break down.

And there's those rare days that I wonder, is the reverse true? Are there things she can't do anymore because they remind her of me? Maybe she can't listen to her favorite band, or play her favorite video game, or even go to work without thinking of me. Or maybe the reverse isn't true, and I've had such little actual impact on her life that I'm barely an afterthought in her daily activities. Just another one of her exes that's nothing more to her than a funny story to tell the next guy she ends up with.

I don't like thinking about this subject for too long, because I realize neither possibility provides me with any sort of comfort.

44,"I may change some details from what I'll tell you because I can be a lil too paranoid with people finding out who am I sometimes lol (this is a throwaway account).

Well, for the past 2-3 years or so my social life has been very shitty. I have a number of ""fixed"" friends that I can count on one hand, with 1 or more fingers to spare, and occasionally some ""seasonal"" friend join my group for a lil while. All of those ""fixed"" friend have a normal social life too, if you are wondering.

This has been going on for quite awhile, and it all began when I had some major health issues 2-3 years ago. Because of them, I had to leave uni for a semester (to be honest, to this day I did not return to the classes totally regularly. If everything goes well, I will next year), and in this period I kinda lost all of my uni friends (this could be my fault in some part, but my health issues were highly related to the uni itself, so I prefered to steer away from it for awhile). 

I dont want my ""fixed"" friend to be annoyed by me (even tho they never appeared to be) , so a lot of times I dont even do anything on weekends and such, so as to able them so they can hang out with other friend other than me. I know this sounds very stupid and I know it is, but I do it anyway.

47,"I don't know why. But it seems like everybody I come across reacts to me in such a weird manner when I'm not doing anything wrong. Today I got in line to pay for my item at a convenience store, and someone from the next line over was just staring at me like I was the antichrist. Cashiers don't make eye contact with me or say anything to me, even though they will be really polite to the next person or previous person in line. Even when I try smiling and being friendly and inviting, people still just look at me like I have some serious defect, and it kills my mood instantly. If I see somebody I know on the street, I'll smile and be like ""hey whats up man!"" and they just look at me kind of weird, pause for a while, and then unenthusiastically say ""oh, hi"" back to me and keep walking. Today I walked into a store and the lady said ""hello"" so I said ""hi, how are ya"" and she just stared at me like I had 15 heads on and said ""...good?"" It is so weird and it bugs the hell out of me. As far as I know, I'm pretty much the only person who has this problem. I feel terrible when I try reaching out to someone and they just act like I have some serious defect. And it seems to happen with 99 percent of people I interact with, too. Whenever I am faced with interacting with someone new, a small glimmer of hope in me says ""this time is going to be different"" but then they just end up responding really weird and rudely towards me, like everyone else does. I'm so sick of going out and having to put my best face on only to get these totally rude and off-the-cuff reactions.

51,"I think if I were to ever actually write a suicide note, it wouldn't be about anything particular. It would be about pointlessness, and how it seems like thats what everything ends up embodying.

I don't care for people anymore -- I would rather stay home and at least have some dream for a better time instead of the actualization of any plans, which always dissapoints. 

In the end I just don't see anything that could truly fill this stupid gap inside of me. This hole that picks at me and tells me that what I'm doing in the moment is not good enough. That these people aren't good enough. That my grades aren't good enough, etc. And thats all true, but I just don't have the strength to try again. Its been so long
Its been so fucking long.
