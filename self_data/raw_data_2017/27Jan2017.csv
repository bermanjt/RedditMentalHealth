0,"To keep it brief, I'm in an awful situation and I'm staying with my parents. I moved out to the state they live in to help them move to another house and stay with them so I could save some money and get my shit together. 

But it's not going well at all, and my oldest brother is basically convincing them to get their own place and make me come up with a different plan. Never mind the fact I have no money at the moment or a car. 

So I figured I'll get some money together and get a Uhaul and move back to my state. I can stay with my friend for really cheap and go back to my old job. When I moved out here my Uhaul was about ~$200 (I moved from Arizona to California), I just checked quotes on a Uhaul here expecting the same price. Nope. It's $1000. For the same drive I did in reverse. What the actual fuck. I'm freaking out. I can't come up with that much nor should I have to. 

Also, it's my 24th birthday and my parents haven't even said anything to me. Although that's the least of my concerns. Fuck.",27Jan2017,7
1,"Just thinking that there are 146k people in this subreddit and a lot of groups who share their intentions and their sub-groups. Can we start to just upvote as PSAs around reddit these kinds of organizations or info about them, and share actual real localized political information around the web to completely circumvent traditional media and campaigning? 

Traditional media will have to recognize it, you have Steve Bannon saying ""mainstream media is the enemy"" so we should work to go right to voters (ourselves) through social media platforms.

Just posting here as kind of a thought, but I'm wondering what efforts are being taken  toward this end currently, and if we can't all kind of start to think of ways to get a solid ball rolling now before elections in 2018. We all have family and we all have friends pretty much all across the nation. And pretty much every city has facebook pages of city services and government bodies with active listeners that we would need to reach. 

I feel like this is kind of a great moment to have a mindfuck about how people in power are telling people what to believe, and that it's our opportunity as individuals to really sit down when the nation is listening and create our own futures for ourselves, each other, and our children.

2,"I find it kind of funny that trying to open this word document caused me so much trouble. When I finally want to write down my thoughts the world still makes it difficult. You know when I was in middle school I was invited to go to a water park with my then best friend. That’s when I think all of my problems first started. I refused to go with him because of some bullshit excuse that my stomach was hurting which it may have been but not because of something I ate, it was because of my anxiety. From that point on I pretty much let it determine what I was and wasn’t going to do with my life. I still had friends back then but that’s only because we were a small group. As time moved on and the group became bigger I couldn’t adapt. I always felt like the odd kid out. I would never speak up because I would always be too anxious about what people would say to me. I avoid all confrontation if I was able to. The worst years of my life have been every year since 9th grade. That’s when reality started to settle in. I lost every single fucking friendship I had ever had because of my anxiety. I stopped talking to my friends outside of school which meant that they stopped inviting me to events. During school I would put on a nice smile and act like everything was perfectly fine. And on the off chance I was asked to do something I would always convince myself that they were just asking out of self-pity of me and that I wasn’t actually wanted so I would always decline. Every time a class mate would ask how my weekend was all I would say was it was good but it never was. I would even have classes with people who I used to be friends with and we would act like we didn’t even know each other. All I would do is sit in the back of the class with my head down waiting for class to get out so people would think I didn’t exist. Honest to God the only think keeping me alive was the fact that I picked up weightlifting. And even though that kept the suicidal thoughts at bay for at least a little while longer just about every day I would still wish I would just not wake up. Back then I don’t think I would’ve ever actually killed myself but if I could’ve just gone to bed and have a carbon monoxide leak that took me and only me, not any of my family, then I would’ve been perfectly fine with it. I don’t think that anyone around meet the time could pick up on these thoughts that I was having. I think I did a great job at disguising my disgust for my life even from my own parents. No one ever questioned if I was doing fine mentally. Maybe that’s because no one truly gave two shits about me or maybe I was right in thinking I was able to trick everyone. I would still make jokes about everything I could think of to hide my pains. I hated my high school so much and I would always tell my parents not sarcastically but I think it was taken as being at least somewhat sarcastic. Coming back to the putting on a fake smile and lying about my weekend I think I have become a great liar so much so that I make myself look like I’m a bad liar. Sometimes I’ll purposefully make a dumb lie and then act like I can’t say it with a straight face. This gives the person the impression that I’m a bad liar. That way I can lie about something that I think is important in the future and they’ll actually believe me. What a great habit to have. 
Graduating high school was probably the best day out of all those four years. I never had to see any of those kids faces ever again. I like to think that I just disappeared of the face of the earth to them. I could finally get away from my house and start over in college creating a new person. But guess what that didn’t happen. I stayed the same person but this time without the weightlifting because of an injury that occurred during my senior year of high school. I’m really surprised I didn’t kill myself at this point in my life and because of that I don’t believe I could ever kill myself. All I would do every single day at college was go to class talk to no one, go play basketball and still somehow talk to no one and then sit in my dorm room all by myself and guess, talk to no one. I met one kid in all of my classes that I actually became friends with. And by friends with I mean he introduced to his group of friends who were nice enough to let me be friends with them plus me and that kid would eat dinner together every day and have absolutely nothing to talk about. I was more comfortable eating alone than with him. The group of kids that he introduced me to are the only group I have ever hung out with and I couldn’t be more different than them if I tried. I absolutely hated hanging out with them they would play fucking League of legends and watch anime two things I thought only losers did (which is funny because I’m definitely the biggest loser out of all of them). But they just kept inviting me over and to do stuff even though I think at least half of the time I would give a bullshit excuse and I honestly thank them for that. But they weren’t the kids I wanted to hang out with they were literally the opposite of that. I wanted to start over but I just couldn’t I was too weak to. My freshman year was exactly like every other year of high school. Being alone all the time made me a lot worse off. Being alone meant being with my thoughts and that’s probably my greatest fear over public speaking but it’s a fear that I have to deal with daily. My thoughts are my worst enemy but they have the keys that I need to break out of this prison I’ve built for myself and the only way to get those keys is to become friends with my thoughts because I could never beat them in a fight. 
My sophomore of college year I think I started to get a little bit better mentally but just a very small amount. Most days I would eat alone for breakfast lunch and dinner with only my music to keep me company. The kid I ate with freshman year got an apartment and even though I was asked to live with him I couldn’t see myself any happier so I decided to stay in my same dorm. This is the year that I probably met the most people that I actually liked. I eventually met this one short Asian chick who was in my group for my music appreciation class who was able to put up with me. I would literally tell her how much of an asshole I was but she still wanted to hang out with me and looking back at it I think it may have been because she was attracted to me but honestly I doubt it. I would eventually eat most of my lunches with her and some of her friends who were all incredibly nice to me. I also had one of the greatest lab groups I think I possibly could’ve ever had at the time. There was a tall kind of dorky kid, a shy anxious girl, and a kid who would eventually become my roommate. I and that girl would study all the time with each other. It was probably the most I had ever talked to a girl in my whole entire life. The thing is, after the semester ended we never talked again. I’m really good at just not talking to people. I don’t burn bridges I just pretend like there was never one there in the first place. Throughout the year I still had the same empty feeling I’ve had since the beginning of high school but this was probably the first year that I finally had at least half of days that I believe I was happy. It was finally a break even if those days came maybe once a week if I was lucky they finally started to give me at least a sliver of hope that I hadn’t had for years. Now meeting the kid that would eventually be my roommate was probably the greatest thing to ever happen to me in my entire life. I actually stayed in touch with him after our one semester of lab that we had. If I hadn’t I would still be in a dorm all by myself, doing even less than I am today. Eventually he asked if I wanted to get an apartment with him and two of his other friends. The next best thing to happen was that both of those two friends of his stopped wanting to get apartments leaving just me and my friend. The place we had chosen was a four bedroom apartment which meant we were going to get two roommates we had never met before. 
Currently it is my junior year of college. I’m on my third major with no real direction in life. Those two roommates that were randomly assigned to me have now become my two best friends. One of them is a kid who would stay in his room a lot like me but he is very different. He has a girlfriend who does the same making me believe that it is a choice of his. But he is one of the coolest people I have ever met. Even though it was awkward at first me and him both mesh well because of the fact that we both don’t do much socially even if it’s for different reasons. My other roommate is just as cool if not a little cooler than him. Me and the other roommate play basketball together one on one. It makes me feel like I finally have meaning in my life. It is the happiest I have ever felt since I could remember. Even though I would beat him most games we would continue to play and now the games are very close. I still have the thought in my head that he is doing this out of pity of me because he is able to see that I’m a loner that sits on the couch all the time, and I don’t think that thought will ever really go away, but I really hope that h genially wants to play with me. This year I have finally made big strides with my sadness. I no longer feel sad a majority of the time in fact I go through most days happy because I’m with those two roommates a lot. The times when I still get dark thoughts in my mind are times like right now when I’m writing this, when I’m alone for long periods of time while I know that my roommates are out doing things. My roommate I met last year does a lot of stuff with his honors frat so he isn’t here most nights and my other two roommates have girlfriends so they tend to hang out with them some nights. My anxiety is still with me not allowing me to meet new people on my own. That’s the one thing that is continually holding me down. In my classes I still don’t talk to many people unless forced to. My anxiety keeps me from talking to any girl I might find cute. I don’t think I’m in the right mindset for a relationship right now but I would at least like to talk to girls I find attractive. Do I see myself getting better with time I honestly don’t know? In my mind I’m completely lost in life at this moment with no real end in sight. Right now I’m kind of just hoping my anxiety somehow sorts itself out. I have never really and still don’t open myself up to anyone even writing this is really hard to do and I’m not sure if anyone will ever see it. I need to start trying to open up and do things out of my comfort zone. I’ve really started to like some improve comedy and think I want to try it out but I have no ideas where to start but I think that I’d be decent at it because that’s the type of jokes and shit me and my roommates do a lot of. Just bouncing ideas off of each other and running with it like its real life. But maybe I’m wrong. Anyways this has started to get into some rambling so I should probably end it there but I’m just hoping that everything will end up fine and that will eventually see the light from this hole I’ve dug myself.

Sorry for the long post and it possibly being disorganized i just needed to let some things out.

Recently, my friend built a home theater and I became incredibly jealous, so now I'm building one too!

Recently, I bought two front speakers, a subwoofer, and a receiver for my house, and I set them up today. I am incredibly happy with how they sound! I was trying to find songs to test them out, and a trailer with lots of bass came on. My roommate and I looked at each other in awe.

Next step is a projector and screen, which my roommate is buying soon! After that, I guess surround sound.

7,"As a country, America faces a crossroads. This is a great country, and one that was founded on the ideals of freedom for all. We've had so many advancements slowly, of women's rights, of immigration laws, and more support for the middle and lower class. Watching such a nation fall upon such times of hate and corruption is hard for me. I beg you to help spread this word. With so many wanting to bring back torture, block out other peoples of the world, and suppress women and the lower class I am worried, as I suspect many americans are. We must speak out, and do something. I propose a community of art, poems, public speaking and demonstrations. Through political comics, art, commentary, and word of mouth something must be done to restore love between people. WE have the power to make this change, and it starts with getting the word out there. I encourage everyone to spread TRUTH, not some alternate reality that is being imposed upon so many. We should form a group, or website, and hopefully in time people will come around. Movements are larger than life, but they start with, and live on through individuals so help me create such a movement, for love and for the PEOPLE'S rights. Let's gather attention peacefully, and dispel alternate truths. Spread the word.

12,"I work at a place for entertainment, and in that place is the ""arena.""  Originally I applied and was offered a job as just a person to run the games.

He tests me on my inventor skills and I pass; I modeled a desk for him and was payed $60 for what was essentially 20min of work.

Later he asks if I would want to remodel parts of the arena, only problem is is that it is in Sketchup.  He asks if I know how to use SketchUp.  Oh hell no I don't, but I tell him if he sends me the arena files I can learn.

16,"You are at a poker table with your buds. You’ve been going there for as long as you can remember (it’s the only game in town). The thing is, you know the deck is stacked.  All the signs point towards a dealer who’s rigging the game for the rest of the table. Hand after hand, you and your friends get shafted. Occasionally it’s obvious, but usually it’s much more subtle. You can’t always tell if a certain hand is false or not. But you know it in your gut that over the years, it’s been a endless game of futility. Finally you can’t take it anymore and you tell the dealer than enough is enough. Then the other guys at the table stand up all defensive: “Whoa now, calm down! Don’t get your panties in a bundle. If you want chips, you’ve got to earn them!” 

You and your buds are people of color, LGBTQ folk, women, and every other group that has been and are still being systemically oppressed by our institutions. The other people at the table are men, white people, straight folk, and everyone else who has been in a state of power (I’m guilty of this as a straight male). The dealer is the establishment, who has for hundreds of years been reinforcing institutionalized and pervasive rigging of the game against minorities and women. The obvious rigged hands are the shooting of unarmed black folk, the gay kid getting bullied at school, and Trump nonchalantly laughing about grabbing women by the pussy. The subtle hands are like when you’re not sure if you’ve been denied a job because you were not qualified, or because your last name doesn’t look familiar or because you happen to have two X chromosomes. Being dealt hands without having to worry if they’re cooked or not is called privilege.  

Now I’m not asking anybody to apologize for playing with the good hands they are dealt. Hell, I can hardly blame you, I know I do. But at the very least, don’t split in faces of the people who call out the dealer. If you’re feeling like a good person, maybe you can toss a chip towards the folk who are getting the shaft. And if you’re feeling like a great person, maybe you’ll work with the rest of us to find a better dealer.  

Oh and if you’re one of the people who think the game is fair, then wake the hell up.  

Tl;dr – the game is rigged, don’t be a dick and spit in the face of the people who are calling it out

He denies it. Makes me feel bad for even accusing and gives to reason as to why that could even happen without him doing it. He says he loves me and only wants me. I have a feeling he did it but felt bad and stopped because now since I've been distant and more quiet (this happened two months ago) he is being more loving.

Yesterday i found a great reply in this thread that explained most of the shit he has said but i can't find it anymore. I will be explaining the Sexual-Assault Allegations, Trump University, The Four Bankruptcies, The Trump Foundation and much more. 

I need the to make sure i cover the worst stuff he has done. People need to understand what kind of man this is.
Im also covering the election and the shady people who helped him win and the insane people he is putting in power now.

Please help me collect the shady shit this man has done and stands for. This is the most powerfull man in the world but the people don't get it.
