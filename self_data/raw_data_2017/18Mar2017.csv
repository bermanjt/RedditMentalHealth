This is all opinion based. Agree or not, just give it a read. 


*****



I recently became aware of this ""idea"" through one of the subreddits I moderate - /r/FellowKids. 

A user mentioned this ""rules agreement"" pop-up message to me which is implemented in /r/Politics, /r/AndroidGaming as well as a handful of other subreddits. 

&amp;nbsp;


Right off the bat I thought about how so much lack of thought was put into this ""idea"". 

Firstly, who even thought of this? I mean, seriously. This pop-up message thing serves absolutely no benefit to the subreddits in which it's being tested. Yes, one can argue, ""By agreeing to this message then all the rules can be enforced much more strictly since they agreed to the pop-up page."" *Assuming they even read the page and didn't just click ""agree"" to get it out of their face.*

99% of all subreddits include their rules in the sidebar of their subreddit which is available to see 24/7. When a user enters a subreddit, the sidebar is generally the first thing they look at and with a set of concrete rules listed there, then there should be no question by them when they are banned for breaking said rules. 

Secondly, this pop up message a does not force the user to read the rules whatsoever. If anything, this message actually removes the desire for users to find and read the rules themselves listed in the subreddit. 

What I mean by that is, when a new user arrives to a subreddit which has this pop-up message, it's natural human nature to not read anything it says and just click ""agree"". We do it all the time. Everyone is guilty of it. Even you, /u/spez. 

By having them initially agree to the rules, people will believe they've ""read"" them, ultimately removing their desire to find the rules within a subreddits sidebar or wiki because they've read them already. Right there remains a problem. So lets say they agree then later on get banned. A mod could ask, ""Did you read the pop up message?"" and they would most likely lie and say ""yes"" at which point there should be no further discussion OR they say no and the mod says something along the lines of, ""Well you should have read them before you agreed."", which makes the user liable for their ban. 

Conversely, if this pop-up message didn't exist, a user went into a subreddit, got banned then asked why, the mod could ask, ""Did you read the sidebar?"" and they'd say no. Which at this point creates user liability for their ban. 

EITHER WAY ITS USER LIABILITY. This pop-up message is just redundant! Especially when it only pops up twice in a users life while entering or separating from the community. 

Thirdly, this ""agree/disagree"" message only furthers the problem behind people not actually reading the rules due to the pop-ups message underlying and ultimate downfall - that its super annoying and people HATE annoying. Let me elaborate. 


It may be a simple comparison but the message is important. 


&amp;nbsp;


When you get a new iPod or iPhone, the software which is loaded onto your computer or electronic device almost ALWAYS comes with terms and agreements. No one actually ever reads them because it's seen as an ""interference"" for them as well as an ""annoyance"", so they just simply click ""agree"" without reading it. 

This is a horrible behavior. In my opinion, by introducing this pop-up message, people will not read it because it is seen as an ""annoying"", which to be quite honest, it really is and I myself am guiltily of just clicking ""agree"" because I wanted it out of my face. Additionally, I'm seeing Redditors also say its annoying as well. 


Lastly, it makes Reddit feel like a generic website. It makes Reddit feel like those porn websites that ask if you're 18 or not. It makes Reddit feel like its starting to become artificial and pull away from the Reddit **millions** of us know. It's not a good feel for Reddit. 


With all of the problems I have and see with this message, I do have some solutions, or should I say - ways to improve this pop up message. 


One of the things I believe would vastly improve the ""rule acknowledging"", or lack thereof, of Redditors is by possibly shortening the entire pop up down to a simple, ""Greetings! Welcome to /r/_subreddit_here_! Please read the subreddit sidebar which will contain all the information you need before participating in this community. Thank you!"". 

A simple short message could drastically improve the way users pay attention to the rules. I think Reddit may have forgotten that in the 21st century where almost everything in instant and we have quick gratification, no one wants to sit down and read a text screen with a bunch of words on it that don't interest them - *even though they should because it goes over the subreddit rules.*.

As an addition to this point, I'd like to say that what attracts users to Reddit, at least one of the things, is Reddits ""archaic"" layout. The simplistic design of Reddit reminds people of many of the websites they enjoyed during the early days of Reddit, myself included. By adding all of these fancy updates which can be modified to remain simple yet accomplish the same goal, you start to change the feel of Reddit. As I said before, it starts to change the Reddit people like.


Another way I believe it can be improved is by actually having gone to large communities first and asking them how THEY believe the rule issue could be solved. Instead of acting upon themselves, Reddit.com should go to the communities. Unless they did for this but as far as I saw, it was just an announcement in /r/modnews. 

Im sure many of you can think of more solutions or alternatives than I can and if you say them I will include them in this message. 


In summation, I believe this rule agreement pop-up message is a good idea in theory but can be augmented or adjusted to better implement the desired affect.

Genital mutilation is still a widespread practice in thirdworld counries and America. You somehow took over a non-christian jewish practice. They do that to control the american population and make them docile and the early trauma is the perfect mental mutilation of a baby to make it grow up to be a soldier. A pawn for politicans and people who want to play Paradox Games IRL with your lives.
My advice is to inform yourself about foreskin regeneration. Don't let the Elite turn your foreskin into skin cream so Tom Cruise can still look young in his 50s (okay I am not sure about Tom Cruise specifically).

I know you fear anger, about being circumsized. Other people direct that anger to false pride of some imaginary ethnic group that feels superior to all other ethnic groups and is the only one that doesn't allow mass-immigration and still has a Jus Sanguinis citizen law. They direct that anger to dilute the nations of the west and make them degenerate. To destroy them. To flood them.
You should direct that anger against them. I know it's hard to realize you will never feel the same thing a normal healthy penis is going to feel. I feel for you bro. hugs

9,"I'm 17, spent several hundred hours writing college applications this past fall and winter. I just got my first rejection back (out of 8) from a college in California that I really wanted to go to. It's like I wasted eight months of effort. I want to punch the wall but I'm pretty sure my hand would break. I put in a ridiculous amount of time, research and effort (didn't have a counselor to help me and I'm in a unique position academically so it was tough) and it feels like it doesn't matter how hard I tried, that I was just judged by the admissions office and deemed inadequate. 

This was my 50/50 college, so I guess I should have expected this, but it still hurts like hell. If I wasn't good enough for them, I'm definitely getting rejected from all my reach schools (especially since no one asked for an interview) and I don't think I want to settle for 40k of debt from the third tier colleges that will accept me. 

This feels like the most important and formative stage in my life. I don't know what to do next. ",18Mar2017,3
10,"We're both in college together and have been together seriously for a year.  Being in college makes getting free time to go on a trip pretty tough.  There's only a handful of different periods over the course of a year that has enough time to travel, especially since we both have jobs over the summer.  I'd love to travel with her, but she's planned trips with other friends, family, and school months in advance, every time.  I'm not upset about her taking any of these individual trips without me, and wouldn't expect her to cancel them.  But I'm getting really frustrated that at some point she doesn't seem to think about leaving one of those breaks open to go somewhere with me.  Last spring break was a family trip, christmas break was 2 trips out of the state with friends and 1 out of the state with family, this spring break was to the other side of the globe for an optional school trip.  None of the trips are unreasonable at all, but man, they're starting to stack up.  We have 1 week between the end of school and the start of our internships apart in different cities, but of course there's already a trip planned for one of her female friend's 21st birthdays.  I'm just frustrated and feel like I'm being put on the back burner.  Is this something worth bringing up, or am I just being jealous? I feel like the easy solution is to plan a trip super far in advance, but I'm butthurt that I need to plan ahead to the end of summer for a trip.  


The 8 hour time difference between us this spring break since she's across the country has been strange, and she can only text me when she's at the hotel with wifi.  I'll have messages show up as ""delivered"" (aka, she's gotten back and has wifi), but don't hear from her for hours.  Or she'll get in and just say she's exhausted and that she's going to bed.  And I trust her totally.  I'm not concerned about cheating or going off and doing crazy stuff when I'm not there.  I just am not getting the feeling that she's as excited to tell me all about her day as I would be.  I'm checking my phone nonstop so I don't miss the small window of opportunity we have to chat, and to get nothing in return hurts.  I don't want to get in the way of her having fun, but it would be nice to have her put a bit of time aside to chat with me.

  **tl;dr**: I'm frustrated that every break from school my girlfriend is taking trips without me.  I'm upset that she doesn't think about trying to squeeze in a trip with me after being gone break after break.  Also a bit of venting at the end about her being out of touch while she's gone and wishing she would put more effort in to talk with me.

11,"Not like a movie or anything.  It's pretty boring how I do it.  The long slow game so that they will only blame themselves, I'm basically invisible in it because they forget how it started.  I remember a few things they did, that made me realize what life really was, decide not to kill myself and to instead waste as much of their life as possible.  I do know that back when it happened, I wrote an email to myself saying what had happened and to never let up.  And because I know who I was when I was younger, that guy wanted things, I know I need to trust the email and keep going.  I owe it to myself.

I know it's working.  They wanted to be rid of me and they left me for dead.  For almost *two years*.  That is what happened.  Then I came back and they didn't know what to do.  Then they were panicking like they thought I would do something violent as revenge.  No.  Everything's ok.  Forgiveness.  Let me back in.  Long, slow game.  And it's been working.

Financially draining them.  There goes my parent's extravagant lifestyle, now they are always downsizing.  Because of me - slowly, but very measurably over the years.   Less and less for them.  More nothing for me, so then even less for them.  The inheritance my sister thought would be all hers when they all left me for dead, ever dwindling.  And I don't care.  I should because it's a lot of money that's been lost getting them to always waste it on me.  Out of guilt for what they did.  No one acknowledging it.  None of them probably remembering the exact ""why"" anymore, just the feeling.

I am incredibly bitter.  It started when I realized why they did what they did - to erase me from their memory and carry on like they were better off - and it only gets worse as I age.  Once it happened I knew it would only get worse with age, and because I have to carry it for life, it has become worse with age.  When people do something like that to you, there is no going back.

The long, slow game.  And I have been hugely successful.  But it isn't just my family.  There are so many people who had a hand in it.  And I can't do anything but the invisible.  But I know what I've done.  I have done so much damage.  To careers, to relationships, to finances, to emotions.  People really just wanted to erase me.  After everything I did.  So I came back.  I got in all their lives.  And yes some got wise and left.  But by then enough damage had been done, I knew they had something permanent for life now, too.

Invisible...

Is the maddening part about it, though.

Because it's damage that was done.  And so effective I can see the damage it did.  But to outsiders they would just see lives falling apart and they can blame it on many, many things.  To the people I've done it to... well, it's damage so significant, they don't even realize it's been done.  A curbstomp to their ego so they don't even know I've gradually been razing their life.

That's how good I am.  But because it's invisible from the long, slow game.  No one will ever know how good of a job I did.",18Mar2017,2

22,"I was raised a Christian. I have no idea what denomination, I just identified as Christian. For years, we would hop around from church to church, some sundays we wouldn't even go at all. Then, in 2009, when I was 8 years old, My family decided to join the Mormon church. Me being 8 years old at the time had no idea what being Mormon and all meant, and I simply went along with it. 

  Between the ages when I was 9-12, I wouldn't say I disliked going to church, but I didn't exactly enjoy it either. I simply found it boring. At this time period I'd still consider myself religious. 

  Fast forward to 2013, I'm in 7th grade, and I'm meeting a lot of new people at my new school, and reconnecting with some of the ones I already knew. One of the new people I met was a guy named Griffin. At the time, I had no idea, but Griffin and I would eventually go on to become very close friends. One of my earliest memories of discussion with Griffin was when in Japanese class I asked him, 'Do you believe in God?' To which he replied, 'No, I am an atheist.' It sort of shocked me at first, because I knew what atheists were, but I had never actually met anyone who claimed to be atheist.

  A year later in 8th grade, Griffin moves to my neighborhood, living only a few houses down from me. As a result, we started talking a lot more and hanging out more often, but it wasn't until 9th grade that we started becoming really close friends

   By the time 9th grade had started in 2015, I was still semi-religious, but way less religious than I was a few years prior. I had started exploring other religions. For some reason, I was particularly fascinated by Islam. In the middle of my 9th grade year, I was reading up on stories of Muhammad, and I read about how upon his return to Mecca, he ordered all the nonbelievers to dig their own graves before beheading every single one, as he watched with one of his underage brides.

   I then thought to myself after reading that ""Muhammad is not a man of God. Islam is a truly beastly religion."" But who was I to make that assertion? I was just another religious person as well.

   Over the summer after 9th grade ended going into 10th grade, me and Griffin hung out a lot. We smoked weed together, and we made music, and lots of good memories were made. I recall one conversation we had that made me start to seriously question religion. We were talking about what happens after you die. He said, ""We have no proof there's an afterlife, and its far more likely that there isn't one than there is. All of your consciousness is stored in your brain, and once you're dead, that's gone. That's why our one life we're given in this Universe is so precious."" 

  As I continued my study into religion, the beginnings of Islam and Christianity, I learned how Jesus had nothing to do with the writings of the bible, and that there are no primary sources of Jesus. I then looked into the Mormon church and found it to be the racist, authoritative, misogynistic, narcissistic organization that it is. That was what drew the final straw for me.

   I was finally able to use my own logic, reasoning, and better judgement to come to the conclusion that religion is untrue and that it is a mind cancer. The ironic thing is that, I recall Griffin saying to me a few months back ""Before you graduate high school, you will either be an atheist or agnostic."" And he was damn well right.

  Here's where the dilemma comes in; my family. My best friend goes to the Mormon church. He doesn't seem anywhere near as religious as the typical Mormon, which I'm glad of, and I've told him about my stance on religion and he accepts what I say. I've told my father, and he doesn't agree with my anti-religion viewpoints, but he says he isn't one to force religion upon me

  My mother, on the other hand, is a different story. She is much more religious than my father is, and my mom has said many times that she doesn't support the disbelief of God. What should I do? I feel really bad continuing to pretend to be religious, but at the same time I feel its necessary to preserve a good relationship with my Mom. I asked my friend named Stephen what I should do. 

  He told me that I should just go along with it until I graduate high school, and then whether or not I want to reject it is up to me. I'm 16 years old. Do I seriously want to continue to pretend to be a Mormon for 2 more years? Do I want to entertain the belief that ""TheMetaphorer is the best guy out there, strong faith and testimony""?

  Within the Mormon church, upon turning 16, boys are promoted to the office of 'Priest'. My Bishop asked if I had a testimony. He asked me if I had any thoughts or rationales that went against the church. I straight up lied to him for fears of what the repercussions might be. He has told me many times that he thinks that I am a good, bright intelligent young man, but I'm not sure if he will still see me that way if I tell him I'm agnostic. I don't even know what to do.

Sorry for the rant, just wanted to get that off my chest.

I spill it as I give it to him, clean it up, and it's only after I give him the drink do I realize his ""female friend"" is his date. I'm a total third wheel and I tried to make a move and I didn't even realize it. 

Well, I try not to let this get me down despite the fact I'm sitting across from each other eating faces. Yes, I'm butthurt. But I carry on in my search for ass. 

It failed. Long story short, I don't know how to interact with people apparently. I did get hit on by one guy, an older gentleman asking if I came to the bar looking for some sort of ""FULFILLMENT"". And then he took a call from his wife and he asked if he could stay longer.

I've noticed that if you preface a comment properly you can be given leniency for an opinion that would otherwise be torn to pieces by criticism. If you say ""take this with a grain of salt"" or ""I'm just incoherently babbling"" other people might not be as willing to harshly criticize you. I know that criticism is inevitable and a part of the process of sharing yourself with others and with you yourself. But it doesn't mean I like it. 


Let me preface this by saying that I'm a fool. I hardly travel, I cannot speak in a second language and I actively avoid in many cases information and experiences that seem to contradict my most strongly held opinions. 


But all that aside, I love Russia. 


I've never been there, I've never had a good Russian friend, I'm not even part Russian. I'm aware of plenty of anti Russian sentiment related to the horrors of Stalinism and repression of human rights and democracy generally. Apparently the Russian mob is pretty awful, too. But I don't care. For some reason whenever questions of Russian importance are presented to me either in the media or in conversation or especially when I'm considering the general state of the world as I see it I inevitably assume in my mind the disposition of something like the blind, unflinching devotion of a wife to her husband in some meaningful sense although it's an admittedly thin analogy. 


It's more than the fact that at my core, I just want everyone to get along, it's this feeling that the Russian people have gotten such a raw deal, they lost over 20 million people in WWII and Stalin took millions from them years before the war even started. So much death, loss and misery. So much pain. Over and over again they defy the odds, what they accomplished in beating back the bestial Nazi onslaught deserves it's own book that is celebrated the world over like a Bible, a testament to human greatness that serves as a positive inspiration to humans the world over. A true Triumph of the Will. So many geniuses, so many artists, so many people that could save the world if given the chance to apply themselves, the spirit that saved Russia from the Nazis can save the world from the daunting challenges it faces from similarly perilous circumstances..I feel like hunger, looming climate catastrophe and greed among other things represent abstractions that stalk humanity not unlike the fascists that stalked Russia and even at this late hour, 'We' the global community of people who want to live in a truly peaceful and Just world can beat the fascists that we've all collectively created just like Russia did in the 1940's.


I wish Russia and America could get along even if it means overlooking the sins of certain actors on the world stage in the pursuit of a mutually and globally beneficial relationship that quickly and effectively addresses the world's most pressing problems. 


I wish someone would make a movie where Russia and America are true allies and friends in the present time and that this new situation naturally suppresses Russian political corruption for all time in this fictional universe. Maybe such a movie, well made and extremely popular might inspire a similar outcome in the real world. 


I love Russia.
