3,"I know there's a lot of ""I'm so sad"" posts here, but I just need to vent.

I'm just at a point where I want to quit. My family life is chaotic and drama filled. I'm broke, jobless, and just completely unhappy. Many times I drive over a bridge, I consider just driving over the side to take care of it forever. 

I'm just everyone's laughing stock. No one likes me. I try to stay nice and appreciate what I have, but it doesn't work. I just hate constantly losing in life. 

Dating? Hahaha, in my dreams. No girl talks to me unless they want something from me. I've never even been in a room alone with a girl, let alone any form of real physical contact other than a handshake with a stranger. 

It's not like guys want me either. Pretty much any gay/big guy I know says I'm like a 1/10. So even if I did like guys, I wouldn't have a chance there either. 

I fucking hate myself. I hate my life. I just hate everything. I guess I'm just going to have to cry myself to fucking sleep again and hope that tomorrow will finally be the day that something actually goes right. ",24Jul2017,6

19,"Holy FUCK. I'm mid-fucking-wank right, and I had to take a leak. No big deal, it happens. Nature calls. I walked into the bathroom, flipped on the light, closed the door, and popped open the toilet seat. Bog-standard bog-action, done it a million times. That's when I felt something on my ankles and saw something in the corner of my eye on the right side. Something brown. I thought I kicked over a used toiletpaper roll or something, which was odd since I didn't have any lying about. 

Then a fraction of a second later after I had that thought, I see the brown object move rapidly along my shower towards the back of the toilet. It was at this moment that I realized, no, that is not a toiletpaper roll. I hadn't started peeing yet, so I jumped back in surprise. The thing starts dashing out again and I realize that it's a mouse. A small, brown mouse with a long tail. It was at this moment that I loudly exclaimed, ""WHAT THE FUCK?"" for reasons that I assume are obvious. The fucker dashed between my legs for the corner where the door hinge is and tried to shimmy under the crack. I was still a little bit in shock at this moment, given that so far approximately 5 seconds had passed. The mouse quickly realized the door wasn't going to work, so he bolted back across the tile towards the shower. I again jumped and loudly exclaimed. 

This repeated multiple times, with the mouse bouncing around the room between my legs, all while I was jumping about and yelling completely unintelligible gibberish. I imagined it sounded something along the lines of, ""AH FUCK DAAH DIB DABASDOASDIM AAAAA DEH WAAAAH"", but I can't be certain. Keep in mind that I was about to take a piss and I was mid-wank. I'm jumping around barefoot in a 4"" by 3"" bathroom with my dick flopping about trying to figure out what the fuck I was going to do to solve this predicament. I had nothing in line of sight that I could easily trap or kill the foul beast rummaging through my bathroom, so I figured my best shot would be to try to escape that death-trap of a room. 

My plan was to hastily open the door, get out of the room as fast as I could, and then close it behind me. Ideally, the plan was to get away from that god-forsaken rodent and leave it stuck in there so that I could better find a way to assess with the situation. After I formed that fool-proof plan whilst trying as hard as I could to levitate, I went to put it to action. The plan may have been impervious to even the most stupid of creatures, but the monster that was putting an attempt on my life was anything but a halfwit. The moment I began to turn the knob(No, not my penis), before I had even started to move my feet, that rat bastard saw his opportunity and took it. He went for the door at the same time that I did, and in the kerfuffle I accidentally landed my foot directly on his body. The unfortunate part about this being that it was on carpet, but thankfully the carpet appeared to make it out unscathed. 

I didn't even realize that I had slayed the beast for a few moments because of the hectic action and my screaming(which was in a completely masculine and dauntless way, I assure you). Once I finally realized that it was dead and not twitching at all, I of course stared at it and continued screaming ""AAH AAH AAH AAH AAH"" for a few seconds longer. I then went to grab a paper towel that would allow me to gracefully lift the deceased warrior so as to give him a proper burial for dying an honourable death in battle. The proper burial site, of course, being the curbside trashcan outside.

I had planned to finish up a wank before bed, but now it's 4AM and I'm wide awake. God damn it.",24Jul2017,310

21,"I'm a 25 year old guy. I'm short, fat, ugly and balding. I've never even held a girl's hands and I've never had a job. I have no achievements in life and no skills. Not even good at video games. My teeth are a bright yellow, crooked and some are so corroded they're see through. I have the posture of a 90 year old. I have a tiny dick I can barely see that only lasts about 1 minute as I jerk it to cuckold porn. I can't even imagine a girl being interested in me unless it was to degrade me.


People look at me when I'm out and about, I can feel it. I know I look like a loser. I have no fashion sense and the hair I do have is a complete mess. People have said to me that they can remember seeing me walking around, even years after the fact, I know it's because of how much a loser I look. I feel so ashamed all the time. I'm sure I'm fucked in the head, how could I not be for it to get this far. I tried so hard for years, to lose weight, to work out, get nice clothes, to take care of myself and one day after all the years of trying I just looked in the mirror and realised I hadn't made a single bit of progress. I was still just as fat and ugly. I procrastinate on everything and I have no will power. I'm so scared all the time, I dread just talking to the cashier as I shop. Thinking about going to a job inteview seems almost impossible. I would show up bright red the whole time, shaking and stubling over ever word. I'm so ashamed. There's litteratly no job I could do, especially one where I had to deal with people.

It feels like I've been in denial my whole life. Even when I was treated as an outsider at school, I still had friends and I still had hope. My whole life I've been thinking I'd get fit when I'm older, that I'd sort my life out. I realise now that I don't have the will power for that kind of change. I'm just so scared. I want out.

27,"I'm a west coast Canadian born on Vancouver Island, widely known as one of the most beautiful places on the planet. Yet in recent years, the thought of returning home or dipping my toes in the ocean is a legitimately fearful one. Marine wildlife is disappearing on our end of the Pacific, from Alaska to California, and likely even further south of that. 

Starfish are disintegrating, polar bears are losing fur with open sores, barnacles and shellfish are disappearing, seagulls no longer flock the way they used to. Over 75% of all fish are reported to be irradiated, including ones both caught by North Americans and especially ones that Japan ships to us, with 100% of the sharks and other top predators that have to swim, eat, and breathe radiation.

Japan has never taken steps towards true containment of this disaster. Even from the start, it wasn't the government who stepped in...it was Yakuza hiring the homeless for 100$ a head to be the front line in this radioactive epidemic. The only reaction from the nuclear agency was to raise the threshold of what was considered to be ""safe"" levels of radioactivity, a despicable move that has absolutely no merit for the health of the globe. That threshold was raised by 3000% of what is considered to be safe in drinking water, the equivalent of 250 chest x-rays per year. Now, Tepco is saying that their cleanup efforts will be in 2021, a full decade after the original spill.

WHY IS THIS BEING TOLERATED? 

This is a disaster that affects four continents, all of Oceania, and the largest ocean in the world. It is destroying the largest ecosystem, and irradiating countless people. The radioactive isotopes are being found as far as Pennsylvania, and currently Japan is seeking to dump EVEN MORE RADIOACTIVE WASTE IN THE OCEAN!

This is a true threat to the world. The distractions served by guns in the Middle East (while being awful) is not going to kill anywhere near as much as this disaster being left unchecked for another 4 years, an amount of time which very well could leave the entire Pacific a dead zone. 

There is no excuse. The companies in charge need to have their entire assets seized in order to deal with this disaster instead of allowing their focus to be on profits. The executives need 100% of their time, effort, and capital to be directed at this. Scientists from every nation need to be figuring this out, because it doesn't just affect Japan, and it doesn't just affect me. This is a world-threatening catastrophe that has not been respected at all, instead having been covered up in order to protect Japan's wealth. If it is allowed to continue...all oceans are connected, and there will not be a single square inch of land that will be safe from the eventuality of neglect.

While researching this, I continue to find naysayers claiming that the radioactivity found on the west coast is completely natural, that the Geiger counters blinking furiously is simply an occurrence of nature...if that is true, then the effectiveness of the tool is in question for it cannot distinguish normal levels from elevated levels, which is the entire point of the tool. Or perhaps far more likely, public concerns are being purposefully downplayed to prevent money and efforts from being concentrated on the disaster, the exact same thing that happened with Chernobyl.

Our world is dying by our hand and from our neglect...when are we going to help it?

28,"This is a sort of long-form, biographical rant about me. It is going to be long, very personal, and - especially since I'm writing on mobile - probably unorganized. It's mostly just a rant, but also sort of an ""off my chest"" thing, so I might cross-post this to /r/offmychest. Some of these things are things I have never told anyone before. I expect a lot of this to be controversial, so I understand if anyone is offended or upset by some of the things in this post. I just ask you to be civil.

I am a 20 year old white man who was raised in a conservative, religious family, in a conservative, religious part of Texas. To give you an idea of how religious my family and my area was, I didn't even know that there was such a thing as an ""atheist,"" or even any religion other than Protestant Christianity, until middle school. I always assumed that God was real and Jesus was his son and that was a fact - I didn't know it was up for debate until at least age 12, maybe later.

As a consequence of my conservative and religious upbringing, I was *very* conservative and *very* religious. If I met me at 14 years old, I would want to smack that little twerp upside the head for being such a racist, sexist, homophobic jerk. I remember when I was 15, I had an argument with my first girlfriend on Valentine's day. We were watching a movie and in it, a guy made a sexist, objectifying comment to a woman. My girlfriend (at the time) mentioned how gross it was that he said that, and I defended the guy, thinking that she was overreacting to his comment. My position was that it was a playful, harmless comment that was not in any way sexist. This devolved into an argument in which I was so adamant that I was right and that he was perfectly in the right for objectifying and degrading that woman that I started yelling and eventually punched a hole in the wall.  
I remember another time, with the same girlfriend, that she talked about something I had never heard of before: ""slut-shaming."" My first thought was ""slut-shaming? She's talking about this as if it's a bad thing that needs to be addressed and stopped, but of *course* we should shame sluts! They're *sluts*! That's bad! There's nothing wrong with shaming them!"" I had so little exposure with feminism - or really anything that didn't fit the conservative, religious mold in which I had been brought up - that it flabbergasted me that someone would say that insulting a *slut* was ***wrong***!!

That relationship with my first girlfriend lasted just under 2 years, and it was not healthy, or very happy, although I failed to notice how unhappy I was in the relationship until it was over. But that's to be expected: it was a 15 (and then 16) year-old conservative, religious white guy in a relationship with a 15 (and then 16) very liberal girl, both of whom are immature and not very experienced or mentally stable (given we both suffered from severe depression and anxiety, I am on the autism spectrum, and she had an eating disorder). It was ill-conceived from the start.

But I don't really regret being in that relationship because that girl helped start me down the path of opening my eyes. During those ~2 years, I fought consistently with that girl over issues of religion, LGBT rights, trans people, sex and slut-shaming, abortion, and all sorts of other political issues. I can be a stubborn and close-minded person sometimes, but I like to think of myself as having an open mind for the most part, and all of those discussions, debates, and fights changed my trajectory so that over the coming years I slowly evolved into the sort of person that was devastated when Bernie Sanders lost the 2016 democratic primary. The sort of person that donated 20% of their very first tax return to Planned Parenthood. The sort of person who looks up the closest Gay Pride parade to where they live and is disappointed that it's too far away to make the drive without their parents knowing.

And around age 16 or 17, the sort of person who starts to question their sexual orientation.

I know that everyone, even the most conservative of us, get a little curious at some point in our lives, to varying degrees, and for varying amounts of time. But I don't think this is just a little curiosity. At first I tried to explore my sexuality by doing things like looking at male models and seeing if I ""feel"" anything, or by curiously searching for mild gay porn, and skipping through it, only watching for a minute or two. Over time this has grown, so that I sometimes look at gay porn or pictures of naked men in addition to straight porn and pictures of naked women. I've even masturbated to this sometimes. I started lingering on the thought of giving a guy oral, and I grew so obsessed with this thought that I started thinking of ways to make this a reality.  
I am very shy and introverted, and I struggle with social anxiety. Additionally, as mentioned before, while I have not been officially diagnosed, multiple counselors have said that I exhibit many symptom suggesting that I am on the autism spectrum. This combination does not make for a social butterfly, to say the least. I didn't know anybody that was gay, and I didn't know how to find someone gay or bisexual that was interested in experimenting with me. I was still a virgin at this point and had only dated one person before, so I had no reason to believe that I could hop in the sack with a guy any time soon.  
So, foolishly, I turned to Craigslist. I would go onto the personals, men seeking men for casual encounters, and I would scan for posts that fit what I wanted, or use an alias email to post my own ad. This happened for weeks. After a long while, I finally got the nerves up to meet someone. I won't go into the details of this encounter, but it wasn't very pleasant. The guy was much older than he described, very ugly, he and his apartment smelled strongly of cigarette smoke, and his penis was small and weird. I didn't like the experience, but it had nothing to do with giving oral. That part, I enjoyed. That part, I still want to try again, to this day.

Around that time, maybe later, another curiosity popped into my head. I started questioning my gender identity. I don't really...*like* being a guy. While I sometimes find myself sexually attracted to men, I honestly hate men in general. And I hate my body. I've always been a little on the chubby side, but my hatred of my body was more than that. I didn't like my proportions. Even though I've always been a little chubby, I've also been fairly muscular and masculine looking, despite only working out very rarely. My broad shoulders, my thick, toned biceps, my propensity for growing facial hair. I hate it. I hate all of it.  
Despite being a little chubby, I think of myself as a fairly attractive man. At the very least, I don't think there are many people that would call me ugly. But I hate it. I hate the way I look. I am extremely self conscious of my body, my face, my whole appearance. I always have been, since I was a small child.

I don't really know how to explain it. I want to be a girl, and I hate being a man, but I'm not sure if I am a girl. I don't know if I'm trans. At the very least I would call myself agendered, but I'm not confident in saying that I'm a trans woman. I'm still very new to exploring my gender identity, as this has only been in my mind since age 17 or 18 at the earliest.

I do know, however, that I have recently discovered a love for drag queens. There is no way I could do drag right now, given that I still live in that conservative, religious part of Texas while I go to school, but I wish I could. The confidence, the beauty, the bending of gender rules, I love it so much. I very much yearn to give it a shot, even once. I remember back to a day at my first girlfriend's house at age 16, about a year into our relationship. I had just shaved my face, and she had just put on makeup, and she *begged* me to let her put lipstick on me. She did, and I loved it. I looked in the mirror and I felt so....*good* about my appearance for the first time I can remember. I didn't think anything of it, I thought it was just a good day, and that I was just in a good mood at the time. But was there more to it?  
Sometimes I think about shaving my legs, my chest, my stomach, just about everywhere except my eyebrows and head. Sometimes I think about painting my toenails. But I've never had the courage to go through with any of it.

Even though it's only been a few years, it's been a long, frustrating struggle to determine who I am. I know that my struggle with my gender identity and my sexual orientation is muffled by my upbringing. Even though my ideals and beliefs have taken a complete 180 from my previously conservative mindset, I was raised in that environment and believed it firmly for the majority of my life. That doesn't easily disappear from your mind, and I know that the vestiges of my conservative upbringing are fighting tooth and nail with any feelings I have of potential gender dysphoria or bisexual tendencies. The ghosts of my sexism, transphobia, and homophobia keep me feeling just a *little* uncomfortable with anything remotely gay or transgendered that I think about, explore, or feel. It feels like my mind is fighting itself to bust down a locked door and find out what's inside so that I can finally get answers.

For now, I'm a man. Quite a masculine looking man, tall, with broad shoulders, short hair, and a big, bushy beard. Nobody in a million years would guess by looking at me that I'm anything other than a completely cisgendered, heterosexual man. And that feels horrible to me sometimes. Not always, but sometimes. There's a lingering discomfort in the back of my head, sometimes very mild, and sometimes burning.

Since I have started questioning my gender identity, and since I have started considering myself a feminist, I have been much more aware of men, their behavior, their mannerisms, etc. The ""nice guys"" that harrass women for daring not to go on dates and have sex with them. The rapists. The casual sexists. Almost all of the women I'm close to, including my own mother, have been sexually assaulted. Every woman I know has been catcalled before. I have spoken with multiple women about how they are afraid to say no to a man who asks for a date or who comes onto them because of the potential consequences of rejecting them. I've read articles about how few woman can get far in businesses such as acting or modeling without flirting at best, and trading sex for career favors - or even turning a blind eye to being sexually assaulted - at worst. I hear about cultures at companies like Uber, who have a track record of punishing women who dare to complain about a hostile work environment, or even harrassment and assault. I participate in discussions about whether a woman should be allowed to terminate an unwanted pregnancy or whether she should be forced against her will to spend 9 months going through the physical and emotional toll of carrying a child in her body, and then giving birth, only to have it ripped away and sent off to be adopted, or have to care for the child when she may not be in a position to care for herself. I listen to old, rich, white men explain why women don't deserve to have easy access to birth control.

I hear about these things a lot, and I think about them all the time. It disgusts me, it hurts my heart, and it angers me. But more than anything else, it makes me painfully aware of the fact that I am a man, and that there's nothing I can do about it. And honestly? I am ashamed of that.
