#this is VERY long. a tl;dr is at the end. but, if you feel you are up for it, I encourage you to read the whole thing. I really laid out the most vulnerable parts of me here. Sorry if I dragged on in some places or this is structured in a weird way, I'm not the best writer out there, and this was all typed using my phone

I'm posting this with my alt account. I usually do post the embarrassing/crude/no-one-can-ever-find-out things about myself on my main account, but compared to this they are child's play, and while I think it's unlikely my main account will be discovered by my friends, or  get doxxed, I'd like this to have no possibility of reaching the public because I am about to go into the nitty gritty on this.

A fair warning - some of this is gonna be really sad, sometimes pitiful, pathetic, and  pretty gross... Not reddit-museum-of-filth gross, but still pretty fucking nasty.

Here we go.

 highschool. I was a handsome freshman with cool hair and a reputation to match (I was kinda popular in 7th &amp; 8th grade) and I decided I would start a sport because I didn't like being called skinny anymore so I joined crew (rowing) and the rest of highschool was gonna be a breeze (I thought). I then got a girlfriend (sweet!) And I then dislocated my kneecap (ouch) so I was going to be out of crew for awhile (bummer). And me and my girlfriend had a mutual breakup (double bummer). And my mom told  my dad it's over (sad and relieved at the same time really). Then my dad went apeshit and threatened to kill himself (wtf). Then I dislocated my knee again... and again. (Fuck... Fuck). Then my other kneecap dislocated (are you fucking kidding me). Then the first one dislocated again, so I had to get corrective surgery. (Great) and then when that healed, my other knee dislocated three more times, so another surgery. (...) At this point I have to use a wheelchair at school to get around. If you'd ever had to use a wheelchair for an extended period of time, you know that it fucking sucks. Then our toilet in the house regurgitated massive amounts of water damaging the flooring. So we got everything replaced with hardwood and we lived in a hotel for 3 months. All the while, my dad refusing to pay child support. Then, a good friend of mine got in an accident on my 16 birthday. I didn't find out until the next day after he had been declared dead for 12 hours. My birthday will remain bittersweet for the rest of my life.

I was probably at my most depressed in the middle of 10th grade, when this shitstorm was at its peak. I thought of suicide constantly. My English teacher was an absolute power tripping bitch who would publicly humiliate students in class (of course carefully avoiding to name-drop, but everyone knew who she was talking about when she said these things) and everyday exiting her class I would think what would happen if I blew my brains out in front of her, if that could even affect her emotionally, I didn't know. At the worst times I wish I could die in a way that my mother wouldn't know. Like I wished I could disappear, and my friends and family could believe in their hearts that I was alive, somewhere out there, wouldn't have to feel guilty in knowing that I committed suicide, and thinking that they somehow could have prevented it. I didn't think about it in an emo kind of way, like everyone hates me, I hate myself, I hate everybody blah blah blah. (I've been there, too.) But in a way that I just wanted *out* . I actually wanted to die in such a way that no one would have to suffer mourning, guilt, and grief. The only reason I'm still alive is because I knew it was impossible for my mom not to blame herself. I loved my mom too much to put her through another experience like that (her brother took his own life). 

I'm doing better now (mentally). I see my therapist once every 2 weeks and I take my meds everyday. Haven't had thoughts of self-harm in quite a while

HOWEVER

This is where I will describe to you the gross stuff. 

Growing up I was relatively poor on my hygiene, I would brush my teeth only once a day, maybe skip a day or two every week, my parents never stressed the importance of dental care to me, they never taught me to floss, and said if I just brushed once a day I'd be good. I would take stupidly long showers for no reason, I guess I liked the isolation, I don't know. My parents would often yell ""what the hell are you doing in there?!"" After me being in the bathroom for almost an hour with the water running. I wasn't even actually in the shower sometimes, I would be meditating on the floor or some shit I don't fucking know, looking back I don't really understand it.

I also had a problem of *stool hoarding* which often lead to [Encopresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encopresis) I would poo thrice a week at most and my dad would often make jokes about how gigantic and rock-hard my elephant sized turds were. At the time I laughed along because I was young and thought poop jokes were funny (even funnier that my dad was making them). Looking back on it now, I'm positive his teasing instilled deep-seated insecurities about my own poop and caused the problem to snowball (because, for an 8 year old, the solution to not getting  teased about your poop was to not poop.) 

As of today I am 18 years old. Recently my stool hoarding problem has flared dramatically. I think it has something to do my stress levels, I'm very stressed right now because we are really tight on money and I need another job QUICK or my mom will sell my stuff, and eventually kick me out.

Anyway, basically right now I only shit once a week. I hold in my shit until my stomach hurts too much to stand anymore.The shits are huge. I cannot explain how large some of the shits have been. They are absolutely massive. They *never* flush. The plunger is my greatest ally in the restroom. However, while that is a problem in itself, the *encopresis* is bad... Real bad... I maybe soiled myself from encopresis as a child a handful of times. But not like this. I own probably 30 boxer briefs. I should say ""owned"". Every single one of them now has a big shitstain. If I feel something wet on my ass, I grab a pair of fresh undergarments, go to the bathroom (conveniently located only feet from my bedroom.), Liberally wipe my ass, slip on the clean underwear, and exit the bathroom. I then curl up the shitted ones so that the feces is contained in a kind of shitty dumpling, and stuff it far down into the laundry basket. This is so my dogs cant get to them and eat the shit (wtf dogs). When I do my laundry, If they come back out of the wash with the shitstain still on them, I throw them away. Currently I am going commando because I need to buy new underwear. Don't be like me. Please poop everyday.

Next gross thing. This was born out of my depression and my bed-riddenness during my recovery from each of my surgeries.

I can't remember the last time I took a complete shower. It's been weeks at minimum. If I press my finders tightly against my skin and rub hard enough little clumps of a malleable, grey, clay-like substance will accumulate. I imagine this is a combination of dirt, dead skin cells, oil, and a bunch of other stuff I guess. Basically I am encased in a thin layer of filth.

Another gross thing. I haven't brushed my teeth in at least a year and a half, maybe 2. I don't even own a toothbrush anymore really, I don't know where it is. The only major dental issues I have is noticeable gingivitis (not periodontal disease... Yet) lots of tartar buildup (not a shit ton but you get the idea) and damaged enamel (my teeth are really sensitive to cold stuff) 
I probably have a couple cavities as well but I don't have dental insurance anymore so I will have to wait to get confirmation on that.

A pitiful thing

I'm officially an unemployed man who lives with his mom that financially supports him. She paid 2k for me to go to college but I have since quit opting to get a full-time job because I knew after the first couple of weeks into the semester I was going to fail miserably. I barely scraped out of highschool with a 1.7 GPA and an advanced studies diploma, a step above the standard diploma. ""How is that possible?"" I don't really know but I may be the student with the single lowest GPA that still managed to snatch an advanced diploma. Yay. 

 I owe my mom a lot of money and we fight about it almost daily. 

I'm ashamed of myself. 

 If you read that entire thing I applaud you. You are my hero, I cannot express how thankful I am that you spent the time to hear my story. I will answer any questions you have.

##TL;DR

Was a pretty normal teen. Then shit happened. Can't remember the last time I brushed my teeth or showered. I Poop once a week and shitstain my underwear almost daily. I live off my poor mother. She is now desperately broke after paying 2k for my school (we were pretty broke in the first place). After the first month I quit school to get a job instead. It's been almost a month and I still have no job. I am a husk of the person I once was.

###TLTL;DRDR

Kids, poop and shower at least once a day, brush your teeth twice a day, and tell your mom you love her 3 times a day.

8,"Here goes... 

I can't give away too much info but long story short my gf started hanging out with some dude where she works. 

She started acting really strange after a while. She previously sang praises of the guy then she quit talking to him and quit talking about him. 

The whole thing struck me as odd. 

Then one night curiosity got the better of me after I received a bizarre email from a disposalble email account. It effectively said ""she's mine give up."" I couldn't help but feel like it was about my gf and this dude. 

I checked her phone and saw some stuff that made my heart sink. I felt like I was gonna puke. It wasn't anything explicit, but there was a certain tone that developed over the course of their texting that hinted at something stronger than ""just friends."" 

I figured I'd sleep on it as I'd never done anything like that before and didn't want to jump to conclusions. 

About an hour later I get another email saying ""she wanted me and she got me."" 

This proved too much for me to keep inside and I confronted her. She began to cry, I was uncertain if it was because she had been caught or something else. 

After a heated discussion she tells me he raped her twice. The dates she mentions correlated to a drastic change in her behavior. 

I told her that if it was consensual to be honest. She insisted it was not and provided some details about how things transpired. When I pressed her about the second time she stated she was afraid that if she didn't hang out with him he'd hurt her, or if she told anyone about either instance. 

Things still didn't seem quite right afterwards and I continued to receive emails from burner Email accounts. 

She insisted that we change our phone numbers among other things. 

She request that I buy her some self defense items should he try anything again. 

Then I got the feeling that again something was amiss. After checking her phone again I noticed she installed a messaging app and installed Google hangouts. His name was the only contact listed in Google hangouts. 

I want to believe her, I do. For the most part I do. But some part of me feels like I'm being played. 

The fact that she hid it from me makes me feel difficult to trust her. I did research and learned that hiding it is common behavior for sexual assault victims. 

I just wish I knew what to do. Any advice? What would you do if you were me? 

I have always been a firm believer that you take every rape allegation seriously until evidence or lack of it proves otherwise. ",24Feb2017,1

Exactly one week ago I was at another party where I spent most of the with this girl. I've known her for a few months, but for the past month I've been quite interested in her. We danced a lot and it was real fun. I had the silliest moves so she laughed a lot. I really like her. I can't say if she's interested in me. Sometimes it seems like it, other times it doesn't. She hugged me that night which only made me even more confused. I wish I could tell. 

I've never really had a girlfriend and I'm pretty amateur at this, so I'm not really too sure if I'm doing it correctly (if such a way exists), but I really hope it works out... She's really awesome.

12,"Hi r/self,

Throwaway, just need to tell someone. r/relationships said it was more appropriate to post here. I moved to United States a 3 years ago to start graduate school and groomed into a relationship with an older professor [67 M]. I was very naive and sheltered, 23 years old and had no sexual experience. This was my first relationship.



He made overtures like touching my hair and my neck, and asking me to write to him every day. This escalated to drinks, and then him getting drunk telling me about how he got tricked into getting married and asking me to have sex with him.



After we started having sex, he became verbally abusive -- he called me a slut, a cunt, said I was too dumb and stupid to be worth anything, that my research was useless and I wasn't even good enough to be be a ""proper woman"" because I didn't dress enough like one, or act feminine. At that time I had already published 2 papers and was a peer review editor in several journals. His words diminished me. I was on track for a fully funded PhD scholarship, and even though the prospective school had encouraged me to apply and welcomed me --- he said it was ridiculous, and actively sabotaged my application.


He took me out to ""celebrate"" on the night after I published a co-authored book, and sexually assaulted me. Since he was old, he couldn't get an erection, and vented his frustration on my body. He held me down, choked and hit me, tried to put his fist into my vagina and anus. I couldn't breathe at one point because he was choking me so hard, and passed out from pain/fear/can't remember. I woke up with blood on the sheets, but I was fine except for some bruising and tearing.



I tried telling an associate professor, but he didn't believe me. This guy was a senior professor with tenure and a fancy British accent. I left academia then.



After the incident I gained 30~ pounds because I hated my body, hated how disgusted at I felt, and how could I have let him touch me. I still feel sick at the thought that I let him do this to me. That somehow it's my fault for believing his crap, and allowing myself to be put in that situation. Why did I let him do this to me?? Why did I have sex with him?? Why did I ever think he cared at all??????!



I've tried therapy, but it's hard opening up about this. No one in my family knows. I have a partner now, and they are aware of it but maybe not to the degree which it hurts me. Sometimes I feel like I can never be in a relationship again and I love them so much but I can't bear to be touched in the same way and it hurts. I just want to move on

tl;dr: Had a bad relationship with a predatory professor, it's been 2 years, how do I move on? Please help

13,"  the concept of being sexually appreciative of someone didn't become apperent to me till love became a subset of sexual appreciation 

    i would dream of the day he would careess my body and slip his hand up places that were meant to be sacred. i dreamt of the big white dress and as his lips slowly met with mine and the way he pulled me closer as he did so. i dreamt of the night when made-out-of-cotton pillow was substituted with human flesh. as i dreamt his words whispered i love you. as i dreamt of the holding hands, the pillow fights, the tickling. but little did i ever recognize that love itself was more than 'love' but pain incorporated as well. unfortunately, my dreams didnt potray the constant insecurity you develop due to our inherited narsassitic behavior - ""we want it all to ourself"" , i was ignorant that ""i love you's"" can be molded into ""i hate you's"" ..  i failed to recognize he is not mine but he is only a prisoner of my love..

Basically the only thing I really like about being a guy is body hair (facial hair included) I find hair extremely attractive and recently I've been growing my hair out longer to feel a bit better about myself. 

Edit, I should note the thing that fucks me up the most is having that intense fear of rejection for even doing something like painting my nails, I'm already pretty socially inept.

18,"It wasn't an especially bad one.  I didn't find myself fighting the urge to kill myself or trying to having to argue with myself over whether life was worth living.  I was just sitting here in bed, lurking on programming subreddits because it's my career aspiration, when the thought crossed my mind that I didn't enjoy programming enough to make it the center of my life.  It also occurred to me that there's really nothing at all in my life that's worth making it my ""purpose"".  So, naturally, I thought to myself that if there's nothing worth living for in my life, why not just kill myself?

I didn't entertain the thought long before I reminded myself that I have a lot of love in my life and a lot more time to make my life feel whole, but it was scary to experience that thought.  After a lot of therapy and a couple of years on medication, I haven't had a real suicidal thought in a long time.

I don't know.  I've made a lot of progress and I'm happy for that, but I can always feel depression just sort of lurking on the outskirts of my consciousness.

But I can't help but feel like when I first became drawn to this site it was the exact opposite. It was engaging. It was fascinating; full of radical people and ideas constantly engaging each other. And some of the most hilarious, mind-boggling, and jaw-dropping stories and coincidences were shared on this very website. One thing is for certain, it is not that anymore. 

Now it's nothing but intolerant assholes of all colors and spectrums dictating and censoring discussion. Everyone is horrifically offended over the slightest of things. No one is allowed to hold reasonable debate without someone getting harassed and banned and everyone considers what stories they share might come back to bite them in the real world. The reddit that first captivated my attention was grantedly reckless, and sometimes led to situations where censorship was probably for the better. i.e the whole ask a rapist thread. But I now wholeheartedly feel the pendulum has swung in an incredibly dangerous direction with it. What the hell happend to, ""I disagree with what you're saying, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.""?

Is it just another example of when something gets so popular that your average person makes it complete shit? Is it more just a sign of the times? Or am I just looking at the past of it through rose colored lenses? 

Maybe it doesn't matter. As few people from opposing beliefs can seem to have reasonable discussion on this website anymore. It's all people just riling each other up and jerking each other off.

30,"The 2018 Olympic Attacks were a series of coordinated assaults perpetrated by North Korea on the Harmony Olympic Village in Pyeongchang, South Korea and surrounding areas on February 12 and 13 during the 2018 Winter Olympics. The attack began when a large amount of VX nerve agent was dispersed by an improvised explosive device inside the dormitory area of the Harmony Olympic Village in the early evening hours of February 12. The chemical weapons attack was then followed by surface-to-surface missile attacks across the Korean border by the Korean People’s Army Strategic Force and a public claim of responsibility by Kim Jong-un’s regime. The attacks are generally agreed to be one of a few key inciting incidents of the Third World War following various military responses to the attack on the part of the People’s Republic of China, the United States of America, and other governments around the world. 

**Background**

Pyeongchang, South Korea won its bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics. The years leading up the games were marked by worsening relations between the reclusive Juche government of the DPRK and South Korea and its allies. 

Since rising to power in 2016, Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un’s government had conducted several missile weapons tests in violation of international sanctions, continuing through late 2017 and early 2018. By the time the 2018 Olympics were underway, North Korea had been subject to six cumulative rounds of sanctions by the United Nations in response to North Korea’s nuclear program and missile tests. By early 2018, it was generally agreed that North Korea had not developed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) technology, although it had successfully tested shorter-range missiles such as the ones deployed in the 2018 Olympic Attacks. In late 2017, the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency tendered a report to President Donald Trump’s administration that North Korea was developing plans for a soft-target attack. These intelligence reports were based in part on information gleaned from the investigation of the assassination of Kim Jong-nam using VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in 2017. 

**Chemical Attack on Harmony Olympic Village**


At approximately 5:15 pm on February 12, 2018, a small explosion was detected in a hallway near the main entrance of the Harmony Olympic Village Dormitory “A.” The explosion caused a small fire, and responding South Korean firefighters suspected a chemical attack when dozens of evacuating Olympic athletes and fire crew members died from exposure to the heavy fumes dispersed by the explosion. A full-scale evacuation of the entire Olympic Village followed, which was complicated by the build-up of hundreds of casualties within the heavily-populated area. By 9:00 pm, the presence of VX nerve agent was confirmed by South Korean military personnel. 115 athletes from various nations and over 75 South Korean first-responders were killed in the initial attack, and subsequent contamination of the Pyeongchang area led to hundreds of additional casualties. 

At approximately 1:30 am on February 13, as South Korean authorities worked to evacuate and quarantine the area affected by the chemical attack, several surface-to-surface missile launches were detected, originating from the Musudan-ri launching site and the Yellow Sea. North Korean Taepodong-1/2 missiles carrying VX and sarin gas payloads made landfall near downtown Pyeongchang, complicating the response to the initial Olympic Village attack and causing heavy casualties, which included hundreds of Olympic spectators from countries around the world. Several other Hwasong-10 missiles launched from sea-based mobile launching sites intended to strike Seoul were intercepted by nearby United States Navy and Republic of Korea (ROC) Navy ships, however, the overall defensive response was blunted by the chaos caused by the initial chemical attack and missile strikes near the Olympic site. 

**Reaction**


South Korean Acting President Hwang Gyo-an immediately condemned the attack and announced a rescission of the 1953 Armistice Agreement, stating that the two Korean states were now engaged in a resumption of open war between the countries. Hwang made a televised statement at 7:00 am on February 13, declaring that the North Korean attack was an unprovoked act of war, that the South would respond with force, and appealing to the United Nations and allied states for full military and humanitarian support. 


President Donald Trump made a televised statement at approximately 6:00 pm on February 12 condemning the attack and pledging the United States’ full military support to South Korea in responding to the attack. 


People’s Republic of China Premier Li Keqiang issued a statement through China’s state press agency that China condemned the attack on the Olympics, citing the deaths of 16 Chinese Olympic athletes in the attacks, but stopping short of pledging any direct support for South Korea. Li’s statement also cautioned the international community against responsive military operations in the Yellow Sea and the South China Sea, warning that China’s claimed sovereignty over these areas would be defended vigorously.

I don't exist to her, I'm only a burdening memory for her, she's a good memory for me. Why does my brain work like that? Why can't I just forget? Why doesn't life make sense? I'm only 18; I shouldn't be going through this process. But alas I have, due to maybe homeschooling (causing me having a warped social life), and a shitty relationship with my mother.

I feel inhuman and unable to solve my interpersonal problems 


The person i studied Saturday with and got invited back to study with is a female who seems to be into me but I'm not into her that much and it just reminds me of my ex?? in some weird way as in I don't think it's directly related to anything like it in the moment and it felt good studying but then 


Then out of the blue I had 2 ridiculous dreams that made me feel inhuman waking up like on Monday I dreamt uhh heather was explaining everything on a couch and it made so much sense I mean like so much sense and she wanted to come back to me so I didn't wanna wake up and last night it was something different (dealing with snapchat) so I woke up and just cried (which I don't do) and felt inhuman. why can't I just forget about it? Why am I so weak? It's been 13 fucking months. why is my life so easy yet my brain makes it hard? 


when I go out for a run at night it's usually because I can't stop thinking about bullshit so physical exhaustion is a different way to deal with it but sometimes I wish I get hit by a car or something cool/tragic



It always made sense to me to come back to my ex when I'm successful..


but I already have come back to her broken too many times &amp; I'm dead to her
Nothing helps to take my mind off it, so self improvement is huge to me. I have to become strong in order to attract her or someone of equal value


There lurks a deadly and paradoxical frustration within my brain: I want to know everything (about her) to solve the issue yet i want to know nothing  to forget about it. I want to know nothing. I want to be ignorant and free of this ridiculous situation. 


The last time I messaged my ex my heart seized up and it felt like my body was fusing with the bed in paralysis. When she replied with a fatal ""Ok"", I knew my dreams were dead. It was not happening; it was unreal, but it was real.

I want to come back to her when I am strong but there's a contradiction there because without her I am not strong and will never be strong without her or someone like her
Above all this seemingly deranged journaling exist the effects of adderall and ADHD which I have no real control over. I'm victim to however they affect me. I've always been, and she just didn't have the empathy to see past that; rather it was easier for her and her friends to mock me as a merciless and manipulative monster. I can't disagree. 


My ex taught me it is wrong to have self pity, it is shameful to have self pity, it is manipulative to have self pity, so I avoid it at all possible costs now, like a plague, and I've integrated the fear of it into my personality to effectively become a coldhearted bullying machine. Any weakness shown by me as a human, and therefore all humans, is an internal problem and must be internalized, and one should never dare externalizing it. That would be manipulative. 


I have mommy issues too. What if I just want her approval? If ideally I had a dying wish it wouldn't be to fuck, marry, or punish heather. I think I just want her approval. Something like a proud mother or something which is something that cut herself out of my life.. I want heather to be there and not distant from me to see whatever I become. I want her to notice. I want to feel like I'm doing something worthwhile. I put all my trust into her and she trusted me and I totally wasted it. This could have something to do with the nonexistent relationship with my mom. I wonder if my mom feels the same way about me that I feel about heather? If so, she never shows it to me. if she did, I would react in exactly the same way that Heather reacted to my pitiful attempts of reconciliation: with complete apathy. What force started this vicious cycle? What force could be so strong? 


I was thinking earlier if I actually wanted her back I could talk about her productively. Truthfully I didn't realize how perfect she was until after we split. I told a group of friends in a discussion yesterday I'm not attracted to asians, white girls, or any in particular type of girl like a normal guy would describe in front of his friends to be cool; rather, I concluded I am most attracted to any girl that reminds me of my ex. Heather wasn't perfect and we acted toxic to each other at times (age?), but I think the way she acted and made me feel imprinted on my brain as true love. Her begging for attention to be cute, teasing me, and obsessing over her own passions infatuated my heart in a way I can only describe as paradise. Lost paradise, worthy of remorse 13 months after the fact. It's a shame all she has seen is weakness and desperation out of me after the breakup. I'm not making stuff up when I say I still love her. All of the fucked up things I've experienced and learned from her could be forgiven if the option to gain her trust again was an option. She motivated me to be a good person because I felt like if I were a good person I would deserve her. 
This brings me back to the contradiction of going back to her again. If I were a good person, I would deserve to have a good girlfriend like her, but in her eyes (and therefore my eyes) I am not a good person, so I do not and will not get one. 


I want to be normal so badly. I want to be self-aware. I want to move on. But, my heart and brain remain attached to her eternally. I reread the message I sent her last May and if I remember correctly she just responded with a link to an informative paper on manipulative tendencies. Metaphysically I poured my heart out into words and she discredited them with... psychology. a liberal arts major. not a real science. thanks. My brain is exhausted from thinking. 


Everything she said about me I took straight to the heart and head. I allowed her to destroy me like some curse. She broke me down, and neither of us ended up strong.

What does the internalization of our problems accomplish though? Pent up rage and frustration? That's what it is netting me. I must be a shitty person then. 
I honestly don't do anything unscrupulous any more besides neglect my responsibilities and play too many video games. But the standards I hold myself to aim to be some strong machine that transcends human error, and I can only picture heather picking me apart even more than I do to myself, because forgetting about every positive aspect about me is one of her methods of moving on. 


If she IS RIGHT in concluding I am an abusive asshole, and I do not agree, then she knows me better than myself. how am I supposed to live without the guidance or realization on how to fix it? I'm left falling into an abyss I can't even see. Besides ""don't gaslight or watch _"" because I don't need a therapist for that. I am now afraid and frightened I'll fuck another girl's life up in good intention. 


So where should the blame, for lack of a better word, lay? I cannot deal with the sole blame on myself despite how much I want to and know it is right. I've tried for most of the 13 months. Friends have told me forget about her and offered advice ETC she messed with you (and there ARE things she did to me that were unfair) but I know it is incomparable to however I treated her. cutting me off with a deathly apathy leaves me swimming in some limbo of morality with no guidance or closure.

35,"This is my situation... 

I have an IP security camera that sends a push to an app on a wifi-enabled tablet when triggered. But I cannot keep the tablet on all the time in order to be notified. 

I DO have a simple cellphone I have on all the time (it is not a smartphone). 

I'd like to be able to be notified (via a phone call or a text message) when my IP security camera is triggered. 

Is this possible?",24Feb2017,2
36,"Well today I found out that I will be unable to recover my Reddit account of 5 years because it was compromised and I no longer have access to the email account associated with it. It is a sad loss but on a brighter note, I work at a big chain convenience store and I try to to be extra enthusiastic and positive every single day I work. Today a customer came to me with their phone and showed me a local Facebook page where people post about businesses in the city. Several people had made posts specifically about my customer service and even more people had commented and liked the post. It just felt good to read praise, it made my day brighter like I hope to do with anyone who comes into my store. On days when I feel like I am accomplishing nothing with my life or on days when I feel like my job doesn't matter I will always remember the ones I make smile

This is my first post on my new account, I mostly lurked for the five years I have been on Reddit and maybe this is a good time to contribute. Thanks for reading my post!",24Feb2017,3
37,"It was less than 10 years ago that I remember people asking my mom and I if we were Japanese/Chinese. Many didn't even know where Korea was. Those who knew proceeded to ask, ""North or South?""- that was in a city with decent Korean town presence.

Now S.Korea gets mentioned frequently on reddit. No one asks me where Korea is or if I'm from North or South. People watch Korean cooking channels on youtube. It's not just Koreaboo obsessed with kpop that I can talk about my culture.

I just thought that it's pretty cool to first-hand experience a culture being brought to awareness in this ever changing environment.",24Feb2017,7

I am trying to get into the business too but I don't know where to start. Can anyone help me (of course im going to ask him aswell)?

43,"For those, who don't know their US History:

&gt; The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.

It's as simple as that. The founders wrote such a amendment precisely because not all states share the same ideology when it comes to some issues. Many issues we face today are not clearly stated in the US Constitution, and the States have the power to enact their own laws and to govern as their citizens want.

As a US Citizen, it is your obligation to do one of the following:

* Petition your local government to enact laws and regulations that the federal government will not.

* Move to another state that shares your cultural/societal views.

Over time, the federal laws may be adjusted to suit the general population, but as it is right now, if you want certain things (e.g. legally available Marijuana, a more fair minimum wage) then you are going to have to live in a place where other people want it too.",24Feb2017,0
