I have little social life and self confidence and feel like I'm not in control of what I'm doing and not experiencing my life, almost like watching a movie. Any advice on how to get me out of my current depression slump and how to improve my social life would be much appreciated ,thanks.",19Jan2017,4
1,"It's only been 2 years, so I feel like I'm not allowed to feel like this was the biggest mistake of my life but... I'm $90,000.00 in the hole and for what? To be constantly stressed about billable hours, never interact with people outside miserable officemates, not even get my own cases, and make $50,000.00 a year. I hate litigation, and have no idea where to turn to next because I feel locked into these skills. 

I get an offer to go elsewhere, in creative pursuits, and all I can think about is sunk costs. All I can do is be terrified that if I leave, I'll regret it forever. I feel at the end of my rope and totally lost. Fuck. ",19Jan2017,53
4,"There's a lot of problems in my life right now and I have no idea how to fix them.

I'll start with university itself. I live in a town that's so close to nearby universities that almost nobody moves out. It means that while I still regularly see almost everyone I went to school with, and have remained friends with loads of people, university has been pretty shit. I've been there for only one semester. The university itself seems to attract pretentious assholes, and while I'm sure there's some decent people, it's insanely hard to find them. I'm really not enjoying to at all. The course isn't as interesting as I'd hoped and the career prospects are pretty lacklustre. I've never had an idea what I want as a career and so just chose a course I thought would be fun. It's always just been expected of me that since I was always good at school I'd end up at uni. I just kind of did it on auto-pilot. What else was I gonna do? 

But on the way home today I just found myself filled with fucking anxiety. Like a massive pit in my stomach. This is not what I want to be doing. I'm studying a course I don't even really want to do, with no end goal in sight, and surrounded mostly by people I dislike. It's a massive struggle to get out of bed in the morning and drag myself to lectures. Often I don't find the motivation to attend. It's got to the point that I don't even really care what happens. I feel drained all the time and I'm just completely fed up, and I'm only half finished my first year. The only time I get any real enjoyment is going out at the weekend where drink and drugs are usually involved. This time last year I hadn't even touched alcohol, and while I'm not an alcoholic or junkie, I've still dabbled in weed and cocaine. I don't condemn it outright, a ton of people I know have done it. I don't have an addictive personality either, I know my limits, but I also know when this is the ONLY thing you have enjoyment from things can go down a very fucking slippery slope. I think I honestly might have depression or something, I always thought I might have like a mild case through high school, but it's gotten worse recently. I feel so indifferent to everything.

I feel like I may get some enjoyment if I dropped out uni and tried something else, anything. I feel like I need to find my passion in life, whatever it is. I spent all of high school stressing about what I was gonna do when I leave and I just took the safe option. But I feel miserable. I know some people would kill to be in my position, but I just don't think it's for me. My parents never got the chance to go to uni, and they were always (with good intentions) pushing me to it. They want to see me succeed, but I just don't think this is the way. My sister dropped out of uni twice, and I remember it being a big deal at the time.

I kind of knew this would happen, and even suggested a gap year before uni to figure out what I want to do. They completely trashed the idea, saying it was stupid, and that I should just go straight to uni and that I'd be fine. But they were wrong. At the same time though, I know without something to do I'll stagnate. I know almost everyone in my town, and it's getting old. But I've lived here all my life and it's getting boring. I want to experience more. I'll always have fondness for the people here, but if I don't have uni I'll be stuck at my shitty job here and I'm scared I'll never escape and be stuck with the same people my whole life, and never really put myself out there. 

I feel like I'm at some big crossroads here. I want to go experience so much, I want to go have some fucking fun. Find what I'm good at, what I want to spend my life doing. I want to maybe meet a girl, which never happened for me in school. I want to travel. I want to do so much, and while I know my town can only offer me so much, and many see uni as a new opportunity, I also know uni isn't changing anything, at least for me. It's just making me feel worse. I don't want to do the whole go to school, go to uni, find the first decent paying job and work my ass off thing. I want something more, but I just don't know what. But I feel like I need to go out there and find it, and get out of this shitty cycle I'm in. I just don't know how to do it.",19Jan2017,11

9,"I have list of reasons why the President-elect Trump promotes anti-diversity and supports the overly affluent Bourgeoisie.

1.He is Caucasian. We need to have a line of non-white presidents to account for the un-fair 200 year influence of racist slave owners and privileged whites who failed to let African Americans and other minorities have a chance. Also, he has blonde hair which could excite the Neo Nazis.

2.He is a multi-billionaire. It is a sad reflection on our modern, liberalized society that only the wealthy have a chance at being president. It is even sadder that Donald Trump is going to be the FIRST BILLIONAIRE president.

3.He is a cis male. He is an utter disappointment to the future aspiring female politicians. His simple existence will simply tell other women to give up on pursuing their dreams and will also send a negative message that women should remain barefoot and in the kitchen.

4.He is fat. A common characteristic with the Bourgeoisie is that they are fat; this is because they can afford to eat steak and drink Hennessy every night. Trump doesn't have to get off his buttocks every day and break his back doing construction. He earns money by doing nothing!

5.He is a conservative. Not much to explain here except that he and the rest of the Republicans wants to bring America back to the Gilded Age. Removing rules and regulations is removing progress.

13,"Hello, 

I am a college student working on a project that involves connecting two metallic cylinders of different diameters. The only issue is that, while I have a basic understanding of milling and lathe machines, I have no experience working with mechanical connectors/adaptors and am having no luck after hours of searching the internet for information. I simply don't understand what they look like or how they work (or how they are actually attached, etc.). Are there any types of mechanical connectors that are simple enough that I, a college student, could design and machine them? 

I would greatly appreciate any advice/information that anyone has. 

System description: The cylinders are being used for a prosthetic leg. This includes an aluminum round tube, inner diameter 2.25 inches and outer diameter 2.5 inches. Beneath it is another smaller tube, parallel to the first tube, with outer diameter of 3 centimeters. This smaller tube connects the larger tube to the prosthetic ankle and foot. The tubes do not need to be capable of rotating, but the connector should prevent the tubes from sliding in the axial direction. I don’t understand how a mechanical connector/adaptor can reliably prevent this axial motion… The connector should also allow a thin piston to travel through it.",19Jan2017,2

18,"Life has been fairly up and down for me lately. I found out about 2 weeks ago the store that I worked at for almost 3 years is going to close and that I was not needed to stay on for liquidation. Okay, so I'm unemployed, no big deal. I've been looking for jobs in a similar field (front facing sales and marketing management) and also seeing what's what to be able to do a field change. I have about 70 credit hours of college done and have nothing to show for it thus far. I'm not in school this semester since I was told I could not get financial aid since my family makes too much, and I actually pay for my education  out of pocket, so yeah...no college this semester as well. Obviously these events have had some impact on me. Otherwise, I would not be writing this drawn out post. 

Anyway, my brother and I both live with our parents. He recently moved back in after being a dope dealer for the past 8 years, and the only reason he was moved back in was because his ""best friend"" shot him. Here's where my big issue is. My parents know I'm out of a job and out of means to pay for my education, and yet the most help I get is being told to check the classifieds or look online. My brother, on the other hand, is getting a paid trip (out of their pockets) to fly out to Montana and learn how to be a hunting guide for trophy elk and mule deer hunts. Tell me how that's fair.

25,"2016 was a rebound year for me in nearly every aspect of my life. I've had many good things happen to me since last summer that I absolutely do not deserve, but I'm grateful and I've been looking at the positives the best I can. Still, my biggest annoyance from last year was how I could never find a girl that I really connect with. I dated lots last year, but none of them were right. I couldn't stay with them. I was coming off of a very tumultuous breakup, so I think I was still just looking to fill a void? I don't know. 

Either way, just about ten days ago or so, I met an incredible girl. I'm easy to get along with, but sometimes when I get along with people *this* well all I can do is relax and let it happen. In this case, we went our first date just last week. That one date turned into spending four straight days with each other in some fashion, and my goodness it was such a fun feeling. I've never connected with anyone on this level. It's incredible! I understand it's still so early on, but I know myself well enough to know that I couldn't take this for granted. She makes me absurdly happy, and we both have such a similar viewpoint of life and everything that I just cannot overlook the fact we obviously have something special. I've also never met anyone in my life where things have moved this fast. It's crazy!

Our next date is going to be getting drunk for the Inauguration on Friday. There is so much about this that I love. If you would have told me this one month ago I would have laughed at you. But I dig it.

31,"Hello reddit. You're going to be the first people to know how I grew up outside of me. It's been really hard to come to terms with this to.look at it and realize it's not normal.

My lifestyle was fairly typical up until Grade 2. There were certainly several alarming moments but in general it was a normal family. Until one day my parents get a divorce. My older siblings went to live with my dad (for a time) and me with my mom. I think it's best to discuss them separately and my different experiences with them. 

Prior to the divorce I remember my father being well known in the community but not too active in actually doing things. I wouldn't be surprised if he was some kind of criminal but he told me he was a contractor. My earliest memory of him though was pleasant. I remember playing in the livingroom while my sister played piano. He barges in and demands she stops playing and when she keeps playing he flips the piano over and smashes it. There was never another instrument in his house. He drank and smoke a lot and even bought a gun. Post divorce I saw him occasionally every other Saturday where the time would be a few hours of him doing errands while I sat in his car until one day he leaves the country back to his home country and that biweekly car ride turned into a monthly phone call (mostly initiated by me). My sisters moved back in with me and my mom and he started a new life in his home country. Always begging us for money, always saying he'll come up but not following through, and worse... The summer before Grade 8 I took a trip there to visit. It was second time I went since he abandoned us. It was horrible and miserable. He drives me to his house and I see a little boy looking back at me. This was his new step son that he neglected to tell me about and inside was his new toddler and new wife. My month there quickly became counting down the days like an old convict until I could go home. His time with me consisted of him being upset that I didn't understand the way things are in his country and him spending all day on the road while I was left alone with a step family I barely knew. When I was there I learned the existence of uncles who I have still yet to meet and saw a huge fight that resulted in him pulling a knife on my step mom. Also worth noting is that not one cent has he given to help support us. To this day he is still the same deadbeat only he has another divorce now.

My mom I do appreciate actually attempted to raise me but unfortunately it wasn't the best also. She became hyper religious to the point of being abusive. My spare time became time spent in the church. I probably wouldn't have minded a more positive church with more normal people but instead I learned of the wickedness of other groups of people and on that front my mom was more extreme than pastor. When I was transferred to a public school due to us having less money and couldn't afford Christian school my Mom told me ""Tell them you are a Child of God!"" Even though I was still religious I had the sense not to be so abrasive. In my house or her car all that would play were angry pastors decrying the sin in others. When any of us misbehaved she would yell at us for hours on end about how horrible and wicked we were sometimes even calling us demons and making crosses out of olive oils on our bedroom doors. She also regularly insulted our appearances. Called me wicked for needing glasses and often mocks my teeth that are desperate for braces. The freakiest part was the speaking in tongues that she'd often do. Church was 6 hours long on Sunday and for the last hour the congregation would run and jump and scream unintelligible babble claiming it was a prophetic language. This environment certainly hurt the mental health of me and my mom. At home there was never much food and she refused to support us in any way financially. For holidays I got old candies hat were often expired. This wasn't for lack of funds because she still gave 10% to the church. I eventually stopped going and as punishment she took away my computer (which I bought myself) and has become more irate with me. Though it calmed down after a while.

Luckily there was one person in my life who cared and helped me work to being a halfway decent adult. My sister. She was ten years older and provided any support that I would clearly not get from elsewhere. I probably would have become homeless or an addict without her. She always knew even though I repressed a lot of what I should have known was not a good upbringing.

55,"I just wanna put it out there that I'm definitely NOT a tight-ass... because that's how this story is going to make me look at the beginning, but please keep on reading to see the whole back story about me and my ""friend"".

My ""friend"" asked me if he could get something for a dollar, I said ""alright just $1 ok?"" and he agreed. When I'm literally handing the cash out to the cash register lady, he just throws a bag of Skittles in front of her and doesn't say anything. The register lady asks me if I'm paying for that 85 cent candy package, so I ask him if he's paying it. He respons with; ""Can you get it?""... In my mind I'm like ""hold it right there, this is NOT the first time that this guy plays dumb and asks me for something extra in front of another person just so I can feel rushed in the spot and say yes"" and after like 5 awkward seconds of me thinking about the situation I told him ""No. I said one dollar bro""... 

It made me a little mad inside because ever since I met him he's played dumb in A LOT of situations. Trust me, when I say ""a lot"" I mean in 100+ different situations we've been in. And it hasn't been about money most of the time, but about time. There have been days in which he asks me ""hey man can you give me a ride to Circle K real quick I gotta get something real quick"" (That's LITERALLY what he says, word by word)... then when I got to his house to go give him the ride at the time he asked me, he would ask me for little seemingly inoffensive favors, but then after the first one he would ask me another one, then another, then another one... it would go on like this until I spent over an hour doing his bidding. The first 2 times he did this I got frustrated but didn't tell him anything. After the ""little"" favors were done, THEN we would take off to Circle K. As I got in the car and started to drive off, he would then proceed to TELL me (NOT ask me) ""I gotta make a stop before we get to circle K real quick"" and the first time he did that, I went with it... he spent over 2 hours talking to other people he knew before he actually went to circle k... 

Anyway there's a TON more I could keep on talking about (like him TELLING me to do stuff back when I met him, instead of politely ASKING me- he does this with EVERYBODY I've seen he talks to), but from this you get the idea of how he is... he's the kind of person that will tell you just enough so he can get you to do him a favor and then he will hustle his way into literally taking your whole day away from you and make it his. This didn't happen after the second time though as I let him know bluntly (and I am not a blunt person just for the sake of being blunt - he's literally the only person I've had to act this way to) that he needed to ask me everything in advance otherwise I wouldn't do any random stops for him... I have got to admit that he got me to do more small favors for him in the few weeks that followed... so that I only meant that I had to step my ""blunt"" game with him and only him.

So now as you can see, that seemingly ""tight-ass"" situation I just had with him at the store was literally me not taking more of the same shit he pulls on everyone he can get to do him favors... his whole way of acting since I met him is the reason why I told him ""just one dollar"" to begin with... I literally don't do that with absolutely anyone else... It's that I won't put up with his sneaky, hustling shit no more (I'm very vocal about it, unlike the whole first month when I would literally hold myself back hundreds of times) that has changed him quite a lot in how he acts towards me, but as you can see some of it has stuck...

I admit I still do him favors as he has calmed down with those nasty tendencies with me (but I really doubt that he has done so with the other people that let him handle them at his will) and because despite those tendencies, he was there for me in a few situations when I needed a helping hand... but I just can't take those nasty behaviors anymore, and it really pissed me off hence why I'm venting about it here...

I know my original question was if I was an asshole for doing what I did today but I clearly answered my own question here - I know I'm not... but it sucks because even though I KNOW I'm not, I still FEEL as one... and I don't know why the hell I allow myself to feel bad for saying no when he tried to hustle me when I was paying... The amount of money has NOTHING to do with it... and I guess that's something that had me feeling like an asshole for a few minutes, after all.. ""it was only 85 cents""... I'm not a cheap-ass... I really do like helping people, but I really needed to vent the whole picture... what I know for a fact is that the girl at the cash register won't forget my ""asshole"" move, and I'm still mad inside because she won't ever know the WHOLE story behind such a simple and seemingly ""cheap-ass"" move :(",19Jan2017,1
