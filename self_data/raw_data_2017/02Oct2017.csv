0,"Hi, just a bit of backstory. Ive recently finished my A-levels and have decided to take a year out of education before I go off to university due to social anxiety and wanting to mature more before undergoing such a huge change.
I am currently working a difficult job as a dish washer in a pub and have very little social contact with anyone other than people I work with, as nearly all of my close friends have gone to university this year.
I was just wondering if any of you guys had any advice on how I can be happy this year? I live in a small village with very little going on but live near a few big towns and cities. Are there any hobbies or leisure activities anyone could recommend to fill the gap school has left in my life and meet new people? 
I've found myself getting pretty lonely and depressed, but still think a gap year was a good idea just to work on myself before university! I don't wanna go there next year and just be seen as a weirdo who struggles to socialise. Any help from anyone would be really appreciated - thanks for reading if you got this far! :)",02Oct2017,3

2,"Ultimately, I regret doing this, but it's not the worst mistake I've made. 
	Now I never was the guy who wanted to do that kind of thing, but a lot of people do it here, so I said fuck it. This was the night I said I love you to Gabi. The night we had some pretty great sex. And after I walked her home, I felt so great, I should have left it at that. On my way back I saw a friend of mine and a couple of people I knew. They were doing weed. I decide to try it, and it didn’t go well. We did something called a gravity bong, basically it hits hard and fast. To someone experienced, it doesn’t last long, but this was my first time. It was really strong to, and it all kind of happened in a moment. He prepared the thing, there was a cap with weed in it, and the filled a water bottle with water, putting the cap on top, and then let the water drain through a hole he poked in the bottom as the weed is lit. This sucks the weed out and into the bottle where you then suck in as much as you can. He told me “do as much as you can” and sure enough I did idiotically. Thinking back, I don’t exactly know why it came down to this, I said I wanted to try it, and here I was, but why that night? It hit me hard, at first I felt like I was being lifted out of my own body, and then the experience is really hard to describe. 
	I was kind of over the experience after about 15 minutes, which felt like an eternity, so I tried to fight the feeling. This is where I started to really regret what I just did. Time was slow and different. I had this feeling that I could only really explain using some clever camera effect, but I write music. It felt kind of cool I guess. But to me it was a little over rated. I like laughing at things because they are funny, I like being in the moment, I like having a good time with my friends. I don’t like laughing hysterically for now reason all the time, I don’t like having an out of body, out of control experience, and I don’t like having my friends hold my hand the whole way through. I want to be in control, and face my problems head on. 
	I apparently ate a lot, and was afraid of having Gabi find out. I didn’t want her to think this would be something that I would do from now on. I called my best friend, then called her for some reason. I don’t really know why, but the day after she said she’d rather have found out that night then the morning after. I had some really bad anxiety, the day after. I fought the effects all day. I made her cry for me, she didn’t like seeing me so out of it. I really really love her so much, that’s the kind of girl I want. Somebody who wants me for me, and not somebody who is always wacky and crazy. She is amazing. 
	There were a couple friends who helped me out that night, and I thanked them all by now, they’ve seen it before and gave me tips along the way. I want to jam with one of them now, because he’s got a bass that’s similar to the new guitar I’m getting. 
	I get the appeal of the drug. I get the reason people do it, I mean I can see why it’s fun, and a necessity for some. But I have no interest in doing it again. I like being here, I like having the concentration and focus of a normal human being. And I guess I’m one of the few who can take the pain of real everyday life. It’s an escape, I couldn’t think of anything when I was high, and I think at this point I’ve established so much of what I do for my music that I wouldn’t even need to try anything to have to be a genius. All I need is more practice. 
	I regret it, but it wasn’t the worst mistake of my life.

3,"Hey there /self. I guess I just needed to vent a little and get some opinions on my situation.

A little about myself to start this off. I'm 24, have a small family consisting of myself, my partner and my 2 year old daughter.

However I have a very serious issue right now that is causing me a serious bout of mental instability and that is the subject of unemployment.

Now I'm not totally unemployed, however the job I do have is of casual nature and therefore I never get rostered shifts. I'm basically the call-in guy and it isn't reliable.

My work history has been rocky. I've worked at my local supermarket for the last 7 years with varying hours depleting the more I've aged, and I've usually worked a second job on the side (which usually ends up being my main source of income)

The last 3 years have been a real kick in the teeth for me when it comes to employment and being let go. For about 8 months I was earning decent money while my fiancé was pregnant working at a pizza place (for my friend who was managing the place for another fella) and working super consistently (as all the other employees liked to call in sick quite often)

I was fired from this job assuming my because the ""big boss"" didn't like me. I was working 30 hour weeks most of the time and had very few encounters with him at all. The week my daughter was born my friend had to tell me I was fired, and the only reason I got was that my boss thought me having a new child was ""inconvenient"" and that he was doing it now to save trouble later. I hadn't called a single sick day on this job the entire 8 months I spent there, and picked up 50+ shifts. This guy also had 3 children of his own, by the way.

Fast forward 6 months after being fired from that job and I landed a part time job at a liquor store covering for someone who was on pregnancy and childcare leave, where I worked about 20 hours a week. This was the height of my employment opportunities. It was part time, paid holidays, I was super passionate about the job and I could have gladly worked there the rest of my life. The regulars loved me (they still often ask why I'm no longer there) and I had a bright outlook that this may be where I stabilise.

Turns out I was wrong about this one too. I worked there for about 2 years, near the end of my contract and the woman I was covering for would return. My boss was also leaving so I thought that maybe I'd have a pretty good shot at keeping my employment. Assistant manager would bump up to manager, and I'd take his position with the lady on leave taking hers back.

This was fine and dandy until about 2 months prior to the boss leaving, assistant managers sister was hired. It was downhill from there.

It happened swiftly. I lost my contract, my boss left, boss' sister was promoted to assistant store manager and I got shifted to the casual roster. I haven't had a shift there in over 6 months, which is about when I lost the job.

Now I'm back with my eldest job again, 7 years later, relying on maybe a shift every 2 weeks. I have a 1k electricity bill on my head, a 10,000 dollar car loan to finish paying, my PC that I do just about everything on (looking for work, attempting twitch streaming, playing video games, etc) is dying slowly, and opportunities for work are dwindling as I get older.

I've been searching for jobs but just about everywhere wants prior experience nowdays. I think I've applied online for 4 jobs I'm eligible for in the past 2 months, I've been around and dropped resumes in to places where I have experience, I'm with employment agencies just can't find me anything. 

I'm starting to lose my mind here. I've been told I'm a good employee, so why do I lose out every time? These people know I had debts and a child and they won't even give me casual work to at least supplement the fact that we live week by week and struggle to pay anything on time. I've tried going to human services (ie Centrelink) and they won't help me at all as my partner earns just enough to pay the fucking rent so they don't care.

I'm tired of running around in a circle, I'm sick of these debts piling up, I'm sick of seeing my stuff around me break down that requires money to fix and I'm especially tired of looking like a failure in font of my fiancé and daughter. I really need some advice guys because this shit is killing me.

5,"This isn't going to flow well. A lot has changed in my life in the past few months, most of it for the worse, and I just need to write it all down in a way that it doesn't feel like I'm the only one who knows or cares.


I'm a sophomore in college. For years my family has been struggling financially, so it was only a small surprise when I came home for the summer and soon after my mom decided it was time to move back to where the rest of my family lives where it's cheaper. I know it was for the best, but now I'm thousands of miles from my friends both while at college and at ""home."" It would have greatly complicated things for my girlfriend and I-- if we hadn't broken up. More on that later. The move happened in the middle of the summer, and I stayed behind to finish out my summer job and to be with my friends and girlfriend. 


I suppose I should talk about the breakup. My ex and I were together for almost two years but we had known each other and been friends for four. We started dating halfway through our senior year of high school. We were happy. When college came we decided to go for long distance. Our freshman year was rough for our relationship. We were only six hours away from each other, having both gone to college on the East coast. But we still only saw each other once or twice a semester. We started to fight more and it was always pointless. Things got worse and I started to doubt myself and lose my self-esteem because I felt like I wasn't good enough. Winter break came and we were home together, but she quickly came to find me annoying and she was clearly unsure of our relationship by the time we went back. But we kept trying, and things started getting better -- until she started drinking. 


Now, you probably assume I'm going to tell you that she became an alcoholic or something like that. No, her drinking wasn't so much the problem as it was the way I handled it. At the time I was a staunch teetotaler. While I would never stop her from doing what she wanted to do, it made me upset and we fought about a few times. It was entirely my fault, I realize now I was uptight and jealous. 


But again, we worked through it. We came into the summer happy, excited to spend a great summer together. That fell apart quickly. When we were together, she was get into these moods that I still don't fully understand where she'd become angry and cold, possibly because she found my presence annoying or I guess I wasn't good enough for her. I don't know. But by early June, she had decided she wanted to end things at the end of summer. I saw a text she sent to one of her friends that I wasn't supposed to see. I was broken. She was gone for ten days out-of-country, so I had time to myself and to think. I decided I would try to better myself to save us, because I still loved her and wanted things to work. I suppose I didn't try hard enough, or it was too late, and come the end of summer it was over. I was okay with it, still am, because above anything else I have always wanted her to be happy. If she wasn't happy with me, then it's best we aren't together. So it was a semi-mutual breakup. I can't pretend like she was perfect, there are a lot of things I resent her for, but I'm not writing this to tell her off. Neither of us were who the other wanted us to be. 


Now I'm back at college, single, and stressed out of my mind by courses that went 0 - 100 real fast. I keep trying to break away from my thoughts about her. I went full no-contact recently and felt good for a few days. But I'm coming down from it now and I'm right back to where I was. I miss her as a best friend. She was my truest friend and I had great experiences with her. I know we can't get back together, I don't even want that -- as much as I do -- if that makes any sense. I want us to go back to before the breakup, because I feel we could both work to make things right, but I don't want to get back together because I know we need time to grow on our own. Not that she would want to anyway, she seems to have taken this a hell of a lot better than I did. Which I can't resent her for, I'm glad she's happy. I just wish she'd think about me. Miss me. I'm sick of bothering my friends with my inability to get over it all.


But hey, it's not all bad I guess. I'm eating healthy, rock climbing, working out, and making a lot of new friends. I know it'll just take time for it to stop hurting. 


She always wanted me to be more positive, so I guess there's no better time to start now. If there's anyone out there who bothered to read all of this, thank you. There's more I want to say but I don't know where to begin or end. So I'm going to leave it here. ",02Oct2017,2

Last year I had the best school year of my life. I stayed well afloat with my grades as usual, and I really came out of my socially awkward shell. Now that I’m out of my shell, my parents decide to put me in a new shell, an Islamic school.

Nobody in that school wants to be there, they dream and beg like dogs to be in public school, where they must have had a blast. Meanwhile I’m here planning my Halal frat party where we can play zamzam pong. I had so many good friends, and I was looking forward to making a basketball team this year.

10,"First post here, on a throwaway because some people in real life know my reddit user. 

Basically I was a mess last night. Went to a club with some friends, met a couple of my brother's coworkers while out there. My brother hears of it and invites everyone back to his place after the bar closed. Went to my brother's house, drank way past my limit, and blacked out for the rest of the night. Apparently my antics included:

Hitting on a married coworker of my brother's. 

Texting TWO guys (one I had just met that night, got his number) and asking them to please come fuck me. Called them both too, not sure if I left voicemails but hoping to god I didn't.

Accidentally messaged my little sister a dirty text meant for one of the two guys.

Hit on another coworker, told him I thought he was gay at first then hit on him some more. Apparently another drunk girl was hitting on him too, so I don't feel so bad for this. 

Ended the night finger banging myself on my brother's couch and moaning like a cheap pornstar. Not sure how many people were left at the party at that point, I get flashbacks to this and I think most people had left and I was alone in the room but still the moaning...

Woke up the next day and my brother's wife was just shocked for me. She started to tell me all that I did and I just couldn't listen after a while. I'm so embarrassed and I want to cry. Why did I do that?!?! What is wrong with me? 

I don't drink often, and when I do it is hard for me to recognize when to stop. I just... don't know what to do. I sent out like 5 apology texts to people and told my brother I was so sorry for being so awful. I can tell I just completely weirded him out. I feel so bad. :( 

Edit: Got more details from my brother. No one remembers the finger banging, which is good at least. However I did end up trying to make out with the coworker I thought was gay and took off my shirt after another girl did. Put it back on because my brother told me to, but still. UGHHHH.

We work together, but work in different areas, so we only see each other in the break area or in passing. But yesterday the stars aligned and we got off work at the same time!

So we decided to walk to the employee parking lot(about 1/2 mile away), maybe 3/4ths) instead of take the employee shuttle. We had a great time, we were both laughing the whole time, it was honestly the best thing ever. Once we got to the employee parking lot we said goodbye to each other and got in our cars and went home.

I was in *such* a good mood after that last night. 

I’ve known her for about a month (got her number the first day I ever talked to her) and as far as I remember, every single texting exchange was started by me. Well today she texted first! We ended up texting for the rest of the night until she went to bed. 

I got so happy when I got her text and had the goofiest grin for the rest of the night, people probably thought I was crazy.

12,"I am 18 and a month into university. I thought I was going to school for something I loved, graphic design. But within a week that loved turned to hate. Im unhappy doing what I geared my entire highschool years to do. I am also living alone in an apartment here with zero friends, and for about a month I havent talked to a single person from my school outside of class. I feel lonely, depressed and unwilling to keep going with this stage of my life, I feel like I need to take a step back in live, maybe just take a year break, spend some time working and see what I want to do.

I am afraid of taking this to my parents. there is so much invested into me at this point, tuition, rent, utilities, textbooks and supplies and just the time and effort that they took to help me get here. But the way I look at it, the only two options here are to take a break, or fail out because all my work relies on understanding of concepts, creative thinking and skill, all three I have been having more and more trouble with as I hate the stuff that I am doing more and more ",02Oct2017,3

I got a new job bussing tables. I only have 2 weekends under my belt, all weekend nights (aka busiest nights for a restaurant) bussing 120 tables. ALL BY MY SELF. Along with various other duties I have to do in the back. I'm busting my ass out here. Literally never stopping for a break, sweating like I just ran a marathon from everything I'm doing. 

At one point in the night, the manager comes to kick me out, which means no more cleaning tables, just do my closing work and get out. I tried to sneak in a few more tables to help out and maybe get some more tips, but I got yelled at. 

Once closing duties are done, I gather tips from every server or bartender, then clock out. 

So obviously being brand new and working the busiest shifts of the week, sometimes not all the tables get cleaned before the manager kicks me out. At that point its up to the servers and bartenders to clean their own tables.

This one bartender for the last 3 nights has thrown a bit of a dramatic shit fit, cursing, not looking at me after I tell them I have to go or saying anything back to me when I wish them a good night. Tonight he went as far as to go ""I'm getting really sick of this shit"" Then stormed off to go hand me my required tip which is 1.5% of their sales ($5).

I'm personally not the most confident person, and I'm super hard on myself, so when people make me feel like I've done a bad job or didn't do that well, I get down. 

Wanting to be a bigger man, I walked up to him after the fact and said, ""Look X, I know your pissed off, but I literally can't help you out any more, manager says so. If I could I would. I'm sorry"" 

Wouldn't look at me the entire time, and didn't even acknowledge what I was saying. 

Granted that lack of confidence might have made my voice waver and get quiet at times, but still. 

At this point do I just deal with his little dramatic shit fits, or should I look into maybe calling him on his bullshit. I already tried taking the high road (maybe a bit shaky) so I feel like that is out of the picture. 

Any advice or opinions are appreciated. ",02Oct2017,3
15,"EDIT: I talked to someone who is happy to get us in touch but shes in a relationship.


I met her at a party last night and we had a big conversation just about fantasy books. I came back after I left in the morning to get my drink bottle and saw her and was not brave enough (and in a hurry to get back to my dad in the car as I rationalized it) to give her my number. We did want to talk to me more in the morning. I think a friendship with her would be something I would be happy with as well. But there a catches;

1 She has no facebook I could find yet 

2 I'm 18 she is 26 


3 I sent a hungover text to my friend about her that came off wrong, If you guys want to see some cringe I can upload it I guess.


 4 She came with another guy but I don't think they were together :/


Yea I still might try and ask other people I met in the party about her. Hopefully it will go over better.


The party was a housewarming party for my DnD friend. I DM a group of adults and one other 18 year old. So I am trying to justify to myself that we could get along and have more in common if I hang out with the other adults so much. But I suppose another catch is that I have never kissed anyone. I think it's a catch anyway.
So do you guys have any advice for when I ask people I met to give her my number? Or do you think I should even try?


TL;DR Met a woman at a party, I want to find her but she has no facebook.

You are the prettiest person I know, and I've thought so since the very first time that I saw you. (What, like a year ago?)

Before you'd said anything, before you'd even opened your mouth, I thought to myself *holy fuck what a person, damn she looks nice*.

Now admittedly I sometimes think well of a person based purely on their looks and then I am proven wrong when they talk. But not you. 'Cause when you talk I am captivated. And it's not just your voice or the things that you say. It's also your eyes. Your eyes and the way that they shimmer. Shimmer when you speak and shimmer when you listen.

When I look into your eyes I feel like I can see into the core of your very being. I see a calm, strong, good person, Lizzie.

There is yet a great deal of things that I don't know about you. This is why now is the time to try and make it so that we end up not just friends. I look forward to hearing you tell me more about yourself.

When you asked yesterday about whether there was (REDACTED BECAUSE I'M NOT 100% CONFIDENT THAT YOU WON'T SEE THIS, AND IF YOU DO I BETTER NOT HAVE SAID ANYTHING THAT COULD MAKE YOU BE CERTAIN THAT YOU ARE THE SUBJECT OF THIS PIECE OF TEXT), you got me excited.

You came over and because you had (REDACTED) I thought that it was going to be (REDACTED), which is cool too but not what I had allowed myself to think at first when you got me excited.

Then when (REDACTED) and it turned out that you were there because you, not him, (REDACTED), I almost couldn't believe it.

And when you told me today, after you'd spoken to (REDACTED) that you'll (REDACTED), oh I wanted to just shout of joy! Of course I played it cool.

And that's what I'll need to do going forward also. Play it cool. But not too cool. I carefully need to let you know the nature (but not the vast extent) of my feelings for you. Not too carefully though, and not too slowly either. If you are in any way, shape or form open to being anything more than friends (I'd like for you to be my gf but I would accept fwb also) , I need to figure it out and to bring us there.

I know how to play it cool, and I know that it is necessary to do so. However I am not as smooth as I wish so it's going to be difficult to pull this one off but I am going to try.

I must be careful so that in case your feelings for me are not like this I'll be able to determine that without making you uncomfortable. I actually for the first time in my life had someone creep on me this summer. It was an interesting experience because now I know a little bit of what women face. And if there is one thing I don't want it is to creep you out. That would suck big time. I have a responsibility to not be creepy.

I am scared shitless that I'll fuck this up, but I simply *CAN'T* let this opportunity slide.

You obviously like me from how you act when we're together. My only question is, *how much* do you like me? I'll push you gently until I find out.

I wonder, however, how firmly I should push you, and I wonder to what extent I should compliment you, etc. I wonder exactly how obtuse or how obvious I should be. I think I should be very obtuse at first and gradually get more obvious and see how you respond to that. But even if I'm that careful there is room for fucking up. If you suddenly appear nervous it might be that you are uncomfortable or it might be that you are afraid to respond in case you think that I am not actually serious even though you might want me to be so.

Should I try to flirt with you? I don't really know how to flirt so I guess I'd better not try. If it seems like you really do like me more than as just someone you want to be friends with though, then what? When do I make moves? What kind of moves. These things can't be planned ahead.

There are only 2 weeks left of semester though, so hopefully I can stave off crashing until then. The doctor's treatments all failed, so now there's nothing left for me but sleeping pills.

I am most definitely an over achiever, and as school has gotten more stressful I've noticed myself getting distant from friends and people I love.

It keeps being emphasized to people my age that education is what will get you where you want to be, thus providing satisfaction in the end, but to realize that your own aspirations are pushing away people that love you feels quite disheartening.

9 hours after the shooting today, posts about it on /r/all were nonexistent. A meme about drinking October themed bleach was number one. Only at number 18 was there an article about the identity of the shooter.

Furthermore, the original article about the shooting was gone. Checking Reddit, you wouldn't even know there was a shooter today.

This is unacceptable. The algorithm should not push major news off he front page. It's even more infuriating because of a bleach meme at the top, of all things. Reddit has become unusable as a source of news. It wasn't this way until recently. 

If admins are reading this, please take a look at the algorithm. It needs major work.

49,"I'm pretty okay with bugs and spiders. They don't bother me and I don't intentionally kill them when I find them in my home...is my life really more valuable than theirs?

Anyways, the only thing that I really cant stand are those massive (NSFW!!) [jungle centipedes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRPzPjOR9lc). Their armored, jet black, chitinous body segments, bright yellow fluttering legs, blood red and massive jaws full of paralyzing toxin...the things are unpredictable killing machines that don't hesitate to take on prey much bigger than them including mammals and birds.

Last night I had a dream that, for some dream-logic reason, I had to care for this fucking giant centipede. It was probably about 5 inches long and was just constantly scuttling everywhere. I knew in the dream that I couldn't let anything happen to it, so I kept trying to re-direct it's movement like how you see herpetologists do in nature documentaries. 

Every time I did that, though, it would scuttle onto my hand and just start crawling all over my body. I distinctly remember the feeling of trying to stay as still as possible through fear that any sudden movements like trying to swat it off of me would cause it to bite me and latch onto my skin. Even typing this out is giving me the heebies.

I kept trying to trap it underneath plastic containers, but since it was on a carpet floor it wasn't sealed perfectly so it would just crawl right under.

Fuck.

So a lot of people believe that we should have access to assault rifles to defend ourselves from our own, or another invading government. 

This is entirely bull shit. 

#1) If we are being invaded, you don't have to worry about foot soldiers. You have to worry about [THIS GUY](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/AC-130H_Spectre_jettisons_flares.jpg/1200px-AC-130H_Spectre_jettisons_flares.jpg)

You see, this guy has some pretty cool features. It can fly way higher than you can see, but its optics are good enough to see you despite that fact. Its also got thermal vision, so there is no real hiding from it. Its also got a big fuck off cannon that shoots off thousands of explosives in a minute. Theres tons of footage of it out there blowing up enemy combatants. They never knew what hit them. Assault rifles didn't help them. They wouldn't help you. 

#2) There is his partner in crime... [THIS GUY](https://aw.my.com/us/sites/aw.my.com/files/styles/news_body_image_1/public/images/M1Abrams/armored_warfare_m1_abrams_1.jpg)

Go ahead, shoot at him with your assault rifle. You might give him a tickle. This thing also has a big fuck off cannon that could bring down buildings. So you're kind of fucked going up against this bad boy. Not to mention all the other technology on this thing that makes it a mess to deal with. 

#3) Even in a scenario where those things got ditched, do you really think you and your PRB slamming buddies could handle elite squadrons of soldiers who have probably been training for months if not years? Like you vs Navy Seals, whos going to win?

Now if you claim you want weapons for self defense in the home, that is a totally different subject with which I could agree with you. 

Definitely not for assault weapons, but for shotguns and hunting rifles, I could understand. There is no excuse for assault rifles.

End rant.

In a completely separate conversation this evening, she was talking about having guy friends and I commented to her ""Honey, it's because you're the total package - you're funny, smart, easy to talk to, fun to have around, you're cute and you have an amazing body. I'm pretty sure all my friends want to sleep with you, and that's including the women. Seriously - I asked them."" (the women, that is)

There were some random flings here and there, but that happened once or twice every other year I was at college.

Not sure if that's what they were implying or if it was something else.  


I know how the song goes, so their analogy kind of weirds me out that I am associated with it.  They just kind of snickered and then moved along when I asked what they meant.

I recently returned to the city where I graduated and found a lot of my old frat brothers in the area.  I would like to introduce my girlfriend to my old friends, but I couldn't ever tell if they are playfully ribbing me or if it's something weirder.

Everyone is the runt of the joke in the frat, so I play it cautiously because sometimes it's sincere and other times it's just a hyperbole.  Like sometimes they would just make fun of you behind your back...Never to big of fan of that, but technically I'm doing the same right now, so who am I to judge.",02Oct2017,0
