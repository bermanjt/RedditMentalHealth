4,"I've been volunteering at a wolf sanctuary where, once I am able to be a tour guide, I can go in the enclosures and do pen cleaning and start forming relationships with the wolves. I am really looking forward to this, but I'm a pretty quiet and shy person, and have never spoke to a group of 40+ before. 

The other day all I had to say were the rules of the tour, and while the first sentence came out strong, it all went downhill from there. My voice started shaking the longer I spoke and if I went longer it would sound like I was crying. Idk how I can give an hour long tour when I can barely speak for 3 minutes. I'm terrified to go back there tomorrow, but I also want to be in with the wolves and helping them. Does anyone have any advice on how to overcome this extreme fear of public speaking? ",28Mar2017,3
5,"When I was young maybe around 4 years old, my mother and 2 sisters lived in my grandmas basement at the time which was like a whole different house with 2 bedrooms and kitchen and all that. Its hard to describe but when you come out of my moms room there was a very long hallway that went though the living room and kitchen and at the end of it was the door to the boiler room with the water heater and all that jazz. Well for an entire year every single night I had the same dream. I would get out of my bed and go out of my room to look down this long hallway. The door at the end would open and what looked like a severally burned  person with no hair would come out. He was burnt from head to toe and there wasn't a single spot of skin that wasn't charred or falling off. If anyone knows what the crypt keeper looks like it's similar to him. I remember holding about 3 hard cover books for some reason and he or she was holding one soft covered book. It looked to be leather for the covers and the pages looked very old and warped like if someone has spilled water on paper and they were discolored to an almost yellow tinge. The book had a thin piece of leather string that would wrap around it and loosely tie the book closed. I would give him the 3 or so hard covered books and he would hand me the leather one and when I would look down at it I would wake up.

This happened every single night for about a year and I just stopped having them randomly before me and my mom moved to an apartment a city away.

Ive never been able to explain it and it still to this day gives me the creeps. I can still remember it so perfectly. Ive been back to the house a few times and every time I go to the basement even though its been renovated I get this feeling of being terrified and anxious I keep myself from going anywhere near that door, not even look at it. Ive never told anyone this besides my mother who just put it off as childish nightmares and too much tv but I can't get over that feeling I had both in the dream and also when I went back to the basement a few times after being grown.

Tl:dr the crypt keeper appeared in my dreams and gave me a creepy leather book before I woke up and have had the dream for about a year and I'm still scared. This was damn near 20 years ago. ",28Mar2017,7

Short back-story: I almost got sucked into a job with one of their affiliates, and have been doing a lot of research on them and who they really are ever since (essentially a legal version of an utterly deceptive pyramid scheme).

8,"I live in a townhouse where our houses and backyards are connected. I've had this neighbor who has speakers set up on his fence facing towards his (and our) house. Every spring &amp; summer he would play his music every other day when he's not even outside. About 2 years ago I went to him and told him that we don't want to hear it and during that year he didn't play his music much but the year after he went back to playing it often. This year seems like he doesn't care either so I've decided to write a letter to him to get the point across as one last resort before going to management. Any advice is appreciated.

Here is the letter:
&gt; Hi, it’s your next-door neighbor. Can you do us a favor and **not** play your music through your outside speakers *when you’re not outside*. There’s really no reason to have it be playing outside when you’re not even there. I’m sure you have speakers setup inside your house (seeing as how I can occasionally hear it from the far end of my house when you have it on full blast) so why not just use those (at a moderate volume level) or get a pair of headphones? 
&gt; 
&gt; We don’t want to hear your music in any case and time. I understand if you’re playing it when you have friends over and you’re all at your backyard. But other than for times like these, please keep them off. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you.

14,"Yo.

I'm Sean. I'm 19. Without being overdramatic (I'm asking you not to freak out and post hotline links), I think about killing myself a lot.

I don't really know how it started. I'm not suicidal - if I was I would've killed myself by now. I just think about death a lot. I think about how easy it would be to kill myself. Like, when I'm driving my car in the left lane on the highway, I'll look over at the barrier and think ""I could ram that thing at full speed and it'd be over just like that"" and then sometimes I turn the wheel just enough that for a moment, I'm on a collision course. 

Or, like, today, I was walking around my college campus when I noticed one of the larger buildings had a broken window on the 20th floor. (They're doing construction on that floor) Part of me wanted to take the elevator up and jump. 

I write suicide notes in my head all the time. A lot of the time I wake up thinking about suicide. 

*Don't think about a clown.* You're thinking about a clown, right? Okay. Now try *Don't think about suicide.* Welcome to my world. 

I'm in a bad mood pretty often. I wouldn't say depressed, just in a bad mood. 

It doesn't negatively effect my life much. I get good grades, I'm in the honors program at my school. I take a lot of pride in my grades, and I spend a lot of time on my homework and studying. I have a lot of friends spread out over the country - at least five, sometimes ten people message me everyday. On campus, I get food or hang with people at least twice a week, usually way more. I go on dates a few times a semester, and sometimes I hook up with girls. I haven't had sex in a year, but that's on me. I'm not very confident and I don't flirt or ask girls out often. Usually I'm the one getting hit on. 

But can you be happy when you're always thinking about suicide? How can you work up the confidence to ask a girl out when you want to kill yourself? How can you do that when you don't like yourself?

I guess that's where it comes from. I don't hate who I am anymore, but I used to. The self hatred went away, but the emotion didn't.

Anyway, whatever. I'm only writing here because I don't want to write in my diary today. I think it's perpetuating my suicidal thoughts. Not much important happened today anyway.

This semester has been worse than others. I've only went on one date, and I've only hooked up with one girl. I've only been to a few parties. School is much harder than usual and the time is flying by. I feel lonely a lot lately. I've been in a worse mood than usual lately, and I'm thinking about suicide more and more which gets to me sometimes. 

Again, I want to stress that I'm not looking for attention. I just wanted to put this down somewhere. I'd appreciate advice but please don't freak out.",28Mar2017,3

Is it the kind of question that someone wouldn't feel comfortable saying ""no"" to?  It feels kinda high-stakes to me. It just seems like it could basically create a ""chore"" for someone and I wouldn't want to put them in that position of having to say that that wouldn't work them and feeling bad about it.

19,"I was sitting on a la-z-boy, corduroy, teal and honestly really comfortable. I found myself letting it all out because, I told myself, I need to let it out rather than keep it in. It was becoming too heavy for me to keep within, to bear day in and day out alone. 

Dr. Ramirez was nice. I think he was either a graduate student or recently graduated and doing some sort of special program. It was nice having someone young, I guess. I admit that I initially felt apprehensive because of his youth and possible inexperience, but I let that feeling subside. I let people show me who they are with as much honesty possible, I think, even if I am quick to judge.

“I know why I’m crying,” I told him. “I miss her, but I don’t think that her coming back to me would necessarily make me feel better. I’m just sad that what I thought was perfect is gone.”

“Maybe it wasn’t perfect, then,” he replied. 

I thought that sounded unprofessional - if I were to nitpick - but I was glad to be distracted. Maybe I’d rather be judgmental than actually face my sadness.

“I don’t know,” I said. “I just can’t stop crying. It really feels like something inside of me died, like a light is gone, like I’m lost now. For so long it gave me purpose, or I convinced myself it did. It was something I used as a bedrock in my life, to give me strength and direction. And now it’s gone.

I feel so lost.”

He looked at me. 

Much more professional.

I was teary-eyed now. I held back fully crying. I didn’t want to do that here. Maybe I was afraid that someone outside the office might hear me crying. I don’t see why they would judge, but that was my instinct: to hold back.

I continued.

“It’s been over a year. I’ve spent most of my life so happy, nary a moment of sadness or depression.” Did I just say nary out loud? “And now, when I’m alone, I spend so much time thinking about how sad I am. It’s actually making it harder to do work.”

“That’s depression,” he said softly. He was quiet in tone, inviting me to speak more, which I did.

“Maybe it’s because I’m alone.

Being alone is so hard for me. I’m like a dog, you know? I need other people or something around me, anything, and I light up. Yet I could handle being alone when I had her, you know? I never felt truly alone after I moved away but still with her, just lonely. But now, I guess I feel alone for the first time without her and in this new city. 

I have to keep reminding myself that I have people in my life who love me, who are rooting for me, who look up to me, even. I have to get into this mental game to cheer myself up because I want me to be happy. 
I want to be happy so much, but sometimes I’m just not. It’s hard.”
I took a deep breath.

“I can’t seem to fully appreciate these people around me. I know they love me and care about me. They keep wishing me well, telling me how proud of me they are. Sometimes it picks me up, but sometimes I just feel so numb to it. I feel like it’s not cheering me up like it should, and I feel guilty. On top of all the shit I feel, I feel guilty! I don’t want them to stop, I guess. Sometimes it does make me feel good. I don’t know. I just miss having a group of really close friends, I guess. 

My entire life I was able to bounce from group to group and get close with everyone. Sometimes we would split up naturally but remain friends. Sometimes our lives would pull us apart but not unexpectedly, like a graduation. We knew it was coming so maybe we emotionally prepared ourselves because we still had purpose. My friends would move onto different schools and stuff, but that was okay. I had other friends to be with. I never thought about looking for friends. I just had close ones no matter where I went.

In college I made friends quickly and formed lasting relationships easily. Not all of them turned out to be forever-friends, but a couple of them did. Then we graduated and separated. I went home and my friends from high school were still around. I began to hang out with them more and had those strong relationships again. Then I met her and my friendships became even stronger. We were all so close. She had that something, you know? She really brought people together.

Then I moved to San Diego, without knowing a soul down here, because I felt like I could be alone as long as I had my girl back home. It was tough, but I always had that light burning within me, my love. So comfortable, I was. I always felt safe, you know? Then after a few months, during my second quarter of grad school...”

I shook my head. It’s just a breakup, right? Why was it so hard to talk about?

“You’re a people person,” Dr. Ramirez interceded. He didn’t have to. I had grown comfortable with silences. I knew silence better than noise. Silence was an unfamiliar creature once, feral and strange. I had brushed up against it a few times in my life, but not enough to have tamed it. It was the same beast that stalked me now. Maybe I would feel better if I could master my silence.

“Yes!” I told him. “I’m a people person. I thrive when others are around. I think I’m a performer by nature, always seeking the approval of others, always trying to show off. I don’t know why, but I love it when others love me.”

Something tickled in the back of my head, a thought that maybe that was unhealthy, that seeking the affirmation of others might yield disappointing results. Perhaps it was that same desire for others’ approval that led me into depression, that made silence so uncomfortable. People can’t make me feel good about myself at every moment, and what happens when they stop? Eventually I have to do it myself, right?

Maybe that’s why being in love was so nice. It was a constant affirmation. It felt like I was loved at every moment, and at the same time, I gave love back at every moment. Maybe that was why I felt so weak now, because while others love me, I’ve forgotten how to love everyone back.

Maybe it wasn’t that people loved me that made me happy after all. Maybe my happiness came from how much I loved them too, how much I love her too. Maybe if I remember how to give back love again, I can feel that purpose again? I don’t know.

“It’s good that you feel like that.” Dr. Ramirez. The office. On campus. Did I just say everything out loud?

“I guess,” I said. “It doesn’t feel good.”

It’s okay to let it out sometimes. 

I think he said that too. Or maybe I said that to myself. 

It’s starting to get fuzzy within this silence.

This started about a month ago. I received contact from someone who I hadn't heard from in a few years. I lost my virginity to her years before. I was 20. She was 17. I should note that this is legal where I live. We met working on a play together. She came onto me. She presented herself as more experienced. I felt like, as much as it was wrong to do, I probably wasn't going to have another chance to lose my virginity. Stupid, I know. After hooking up with her a few times, she informed me she is engaged. I tried (being young and having never been in this situation before), but found that I couldn't enjoy myself with her anymore. She contacted me in the middle of the night for a booty call. I refused and offered to see her another time, not intending to follow through. She threatened to go to the police and tell them what I did with her. I told her I wouldn't have slept with her if it were illegal. She implied that it wouldn't matter. I blocked her.

When she contacted me a month ago, she apologized profusely. She said she wasn't actually engaged and that was actually a joke from a play she had been in in high school. Who knows what's true at this point? We catch up sporadically in messages for about a week and then...well, things happened again. It was another hookup. She agreed to let me check her apartment for anyone other than her beforehand, which I did. She seemed interested in dating, but nothing serious. It was a fun night.

A couple days after that, I add her on Facebook and find that a lot of her shared posts are fairly racist. General ""white people are evil"" stuff, but still, kind of hard for me to remain attracted to her if I think she's going to be silently judging me or my family just because we were born a certain way. So, now I feel like I've slept with the same girl and now it's going to come back and bite me in the ass. That especially sucks since I just got over the issues it caused me during the initial meltdown.

But that's just the beginning. During our catch up conversations, a friend came up. She was the first friend I ever made in theatre. That outstretched hand saved me in a lot of ways. I felt like an outcast even in a medium that attracted outcasts, but she helped me feel like I had a place. She eventually disappeared and then we reunited on the same show where I met the aforementioned hookup. My friend had disappeared because she had a problem with both meth and heroin. She showed me her 7 day coin. I told her I would be there if she needed me and I wanted to do whatever I could to help.

She eventually moved to Chicago and became a guy. He seemed very happy. She died of a heroin overdose. The hookup informed me. It had happened a full month before. I had just missed the celebration of life that they had here for her. I felt awful. This person who helped me through hard times died and I didn't even know. I never did anything to help. I never saw him the few times he came back home. I never expected it. I don't think I've really processed it yet. Life hasn't let me.

A few days after I found out, I develop an awful toothache. I immediately know this is an infected tooth abscess. It was originally diagnosed in January and treated with antibiotics. I have since been trying to get a root canal retreatment scheduled to fix it, but I am dealing with a local dental school as I recently switched to Medicaid. Their scheduling process basically comes down to ""call us, we'll call you back tomorrow and, if you miss the call, you have to call us and wait a day again because we can't be fucked to leave a message."" Once the pain began, I dialed their emergency number and had an appointment the next day. At this point, I am alternating ibuprofen and percocet (some given to me for the first infection and some given to me by my mom, who suffers from back sciatica), so I'm fairly out of it from the percs and not being able to eat because my moth hurts.

When I go to the school, the student dentist is half an hour late. When he finally takes me in, he looks and tells me it needs to be removed, but it can't be done today because I had a late appointment. Yes, he really put it on me for being late. I ask about a root canal retreatment and he says it's too expensive. I ask how expensive and he tells me. It's expensive. He says insurance won't cover it. We stop at the cashier's office and she says it will cover it. She calls the student doctor, he comes out, says something to her, and walks off. Nobody tells me what's going on and the cashier just says ""make the appointment and it will be handled"" when I ask with no other explanation.

I have since found out that medicaid should cover this procedure due to the infection making it medically necessary. Unfortunately, I am also back in this school's ""call and wait"" scheduling process. This is scary for three main reasons.

1) An untreated tooth abscess can fuck you right up. It can become necrotizing fascitis. It can spread to the brain and cause a fatal brain abscess. It can spread downwards and cause swelling that blocks airways. This is an untreated tooth abscess. What scares me is the lack of treatment I had. I asked my student doctor about getting antibiotics and he said he didn't want to prescribe them because he felt I would just take the antibiotics and skip the appointment. I assured him that's not the plan (I didn't have the heart to say ""TAKE THIS DEATH TOOTH OUT OF MY HEAD RIGHT NOW"") and he said we should make an appointment now. I said that would be great and he offered one the next day. Unfortunately, I had to work and my job has a strict no-call-off policy. So, I offered the next day, a Friday. He said ""we're not here Friday"". I offered some time next week. He said that wouldn't work. I asked why. Fucking. Spring. Break. Still, he refused me antibiotics. I figured the doctor knows best and I should be fine.

2) The next day, the swelling had gone up under the tooth, indicating that I was not, in fact, fine. I called the dental school and explained the situation. I was speaking to a resident doctor of some sort. She said she needed to talk to the student doctor and call me back. Thirty minutes later, she called me back and informed me that he refused me antibiotics for the same reason as the day before. I explained that the swelling was worse and there was no way I could get an appointment for the next week. She said she'd speak to the student doctor's supervisor, put me on hold for a minute, then came back and said the supervisor refused me antibiotics too. I lost my cool. For one, I didn't believe for one second that it took her a half hour to find the student, but she had a direct line to his supervisor. Two, I wasn't about to die because my life isn't worth the same as time off and fuck you if you try to treat me that way.

3) And to move away from the medical, I am currently finishing my degree on financial aid appeal. What that means is I can't fail a class. Obviously, this is the worst time to be suffering debilitating toothaches. I already missed about two weeks of classes due to a bad sinus infection (which I'm actually starting to wonder if it was caused by the tooth infection). I feel like my back is to the wall and I can't even get what is apparently a dire situation remedied by medical professionals. I feel like every ounce of self-loathing that I feel is completely rational because, if I were truly a good person, why am I not worthy of medical attention?

But that's for r/depression. In all honesty, so is the next part of my story.

So, I end up getting antibiotics from my general physician. I spend the week of the dental school's spring break getting caught up in school (though I'm still somewhat behind as of this writing). I figure I'll make my appointments first thing Monday morning (3/27). All should be fine. Sunday was actually a somewhat nice day. I've been working on a creative project which involves me playing a bitter childish character who decides to become a rapper. Stupid, but fun. It's based on a lot of qualities I had that I once tried to justify, but have since realized were unhealthy. One of those qualities is my propensity for blaming everything on myself.

Sunday was rainy, but the rain eventually subsided and a gorgeous mist hung over the field behind our house. So, I took my phone out and made a quick video. Just panning across the puddles and my neighbor's house, then showing the field and saying that it's my fault because I'm making videos again. The character is purposely not well-spoken unless rapping, so I also put ""Sorry I'm making videos again. This is my fault."" in the description. I upload the video and I go about my day.

That night, my mom, who I moved back in with after she got heart surgery (just noting because, God bless her now part-pig heart, it's something I worry about a lot), comes home from work. I can hear her speaking to someone in the driveway. I come outside. It's a police officer. They're next door at my neighbor's house. My mom walks over to me.

""Greg died, honey. He died a while ago.""

Me and Greg were never great friends. In fact, I got the sense he was afraid of people my age. He was 64. I am 26. He seemed like a nice guy. He sent a few nice Christmas cards and would speak to my mom if I wasn't around (generally during the two years I had moved out), but he kept to himself and even left town during some winters. I figured he had left town again, though it had occurred to me that he usually drove himself to the airport, but his SUV was still parked in his driveway. He was a bit on the big side and would often over-exert himself in the yard. Truth be told, as sad as it is, I wasn't completely surprised. Shocked, sickened, saddened, but not particularly surprised.

And then I'm hit with the most selfish thought I've ever had. The video. That stupid fucking video. Of all the days for me to pan a camera past my neighbor's house and say the words ""it's my fault"", it just has to be the day his dead body is found inside. I couldn't have worse luck if I tried.

I immediately feel awful. I delete the video out of respect for him and then ol' anxiety brain pops up.

""Y'know, that would look incriminating if anyone had noticed that...which they did. Everyone, of course, but the police in particular.""

I hadn't spoken to the guy in years, not for lack of trying. I would generally say ""hi"" if I saw him, but he never answered me. I didn't see the inside of his house until I pulled up to my house today and the front door was open while his family moved his stuff out to the curb. I went over and offered my condolences and help if needed. They refused, but thanked me. All I could think about was the video. How the fuck does that even happen? How unlucky can I get? How selfish can I get? How scared can I needlessly make myself?

Due to missed sleep the night before, I lay down for a nap and miss my second class. Of course, it's one of the ones I'm behind in. So, now I'm scared about dying (both randomly and from the tooth infection), being alone, my grades, my job (which I never got into here, but trust me, the DVD rental business isn't hot and sales is the worst job an anxious person can have), my mom's heart going out, and my stupid brain convincing me that I'm going to get slapped with a bogus murder charge.

28,"I'm in love with a slut. I know she's a slut because she calls herself a slut and she fucks a different guy every week and for some stupid reason I love her.

--------------------------------------------------------

The other night I ran into her at a thing and we left together.

On the bus back she'd stared at me for a while, her hazel eyes melting my heart, before looking over at her friend and saying ""If I fuck him tonight, don't tell the girls.""

I'd asked her ""Who?"" because her and I, we were just friends.

""I went on a date earlier.""

""Oh.""

She was still staring at me. ""I like the way you look in this light.""

""You look good too.""

Her friend - ""What's so special about this light?""

And she said ""The blue. I like the way the blue makes everything look. It's so mysterious.""

The bus hit a bump and we all shook. A football player standing in the back almost lost his grip. She wasn't looking at me anymore.

*There's no way she feels that way about me. I'm too in love for her for that to be real. That would be too perfect. I could die and go to hell and still be happy as long as she kisses me.* 

We got off the bus.

Outside of her room we stopped, and she looked back at me, winked, and blew a kiss. *""Have a good night.""* 
 
I stared at her for a second. I knew she was teasing me.

""You too."" She disappeared into her room.

I few minutes later I texted her and asked her if I could come over.

""I'm sorry, it isn't a good time. Is everything okay?"" 

Right. The dude. Why would she ever want to fuck me?

""Yeah. Everything's fine. I just thought you were flirting with me back there.""

""Oh...no. I'm sorry, I do that by accident sometimes. I didn't mean to give you that impression.""

""Oh. Yeah, no, it's fine, I got confused. Sorry.""""

I wished I'd never met her. 

------------------------------------------

I've been trying to cut her out of my life. She'd scream if she knew how I felt. I don't even like how I feel. I don't hang out with her much anymore, but whenever I run into her she compliments me and it always breaks my heart.

I wish I could write this to you in a way that makes you see it like I do. ",28Mar2017,0

32,"My girl of almost 3 years left me for another guy (for her moms boyfriend actually lol I know super fucked up) a little over a month ago. I was extremely depressed &amp; upset about it. But now im thinking its the best thing that ever happened to me. I could never quit using when I was with her as her &amp; her whole family were user’s, &amp; the people she lived with all used &amp; none of them had jobs or a plan for the future. almost 3 years I wasted my life being like them &amp; I forgot what its like to have my shit together…
 I decided to quit smoking speed after the breakup &amp; fuck it feels good. I got past the stage of being unable to get out of bed &amp; having absolutely no energy. I gained my weight back I feel so much more confident than I was. I found a (fulltime) job &amp; now that I have no addictions to feed other than my smoking habit I literally have nothing to spend my money on I just save that shit. Its payday in 4 days and I spent only $80 since my last paycheque.  
I did relapse about a week or so ago. The whole time I was high, I was overthinking my issues &amp; feeling really upset that my ex left me for another guy &amp; the whole time I was on it I was thinking fuck, this drug sucks. Not only could I not stop thinking about that shit, but I couldn’t sleep. I stayed up all night just miserable in my own head feeling bad for myself &amp; thinking about the things I should have or shouldn’t have done differently... It was not fun at all. If there was a pipe put infront of me right now, I wouldn’t even hit it just because I don’t want to go through that again.
I used to plan my future out &amp; include how I could keep on using &amp; afford my addiction in the future. My priorities were fucked when I was with that chick lol. I went through one of the loneliest &amp; most depressing times of my life while I was getting clean &amp; dealing with the breakup but its finally starting to pay off. I wake up and I have a purpose now &amp; am excited about my goals. Before I had no goals the only priorities I had were how i'm gonna get money for more shit before I run out.

Anyways, I am glad that bitch left me for another guy. I feel like in this past month or so I’ve improved myself in more ways than I have that whole 3 years I was with her. I learned from this whole experience that I have to always focus on my life &amp; do what I need to do before anything else. Ill never allow a girl to dictate how my life is again. I had my shit together before I met her, and almost instantly my life changed for the worst. Never again will I let good pussy interfere with my goals &amp; dreams. 
Anyways, thanks for reading – im out.

35,"Hello everyone , I don't know if this is the right place to post about this but I really need to talk about this. I'm 23 and I'm from Europe. I graduated in Advertising last year. During University , in the 2nd year to be exact, I decided to take the opportunity provided by the Work and Travel program and work in the United States of America for the summer. I decided to choose a small city to live and work for 4 months (duration of J1 visa) in the state of NY. I rented a room in a poor part of the city and I was living with students like me , but from another country .I got 2 jobs , worked for up to 17 hours a day and I enjoyed every second. I grew up with American movies and living there was even better than I expected. The friends I made there were real. Everything felt great and like It was supposed to. I was happy.
I’m back home for almost 2 years, I got a nice job but I can’t enjoy anything anymore. Nothing feels like it supposed to and I’m miserable. I would give up everything I have in order to live there again. Every year I apply for the diversity visa program and hope for the best but the odds are really low. Even after that , If I had to take that decision again, I would do it because it was priceless.

39,"My dad thinks I'm crazy for even considering getting rid of my TV. Well, I stopped watching cable 2 years ago and I don't miss it. I don't play video games. Sometimes I watch movies and Netflix. I don't enjoy that like I used to though. Most of the shows are so stupid that I can't develop an interest in them. Or they're TV shows that I've watched thousands of times out of boredom. 

I've given this quite a bit of thought. I still have my computer if I want to watch Netflix. However, I'd rather cut back on my screen time entirely. I've been making the rounds at the used books stores in my area and have quite a collection sitting on my shelf. I also got a new bicycle that practically shines with interest whenever there is a sunny day. Plus I'd like to invest more time in my relationships with friends and family. 

My suite is tiny. If I got rid of the TV, stand and coffee table I could fit something else in the space. Maybe a small workbench for fly tying and I could have a fold up table for game nights with my friends that I could move in and out. Or another bookshelf. 

I don't think I need a television. What are your thoughts? ",28Mar2017,1

We have children together, and I get along fairly well with my ex-wife, but I haven't yet been able to move out of the house due to our financial situation.  I am working on getting a loan and looking at affordable houses within my price range.  Lately at work I've been assigned to a gigantic task that will take a long time and is very tedious.  I have been feeling like I'm being kicked when I'm already down...I have been seeing a therapist who has prescribed medication, but I haven't been taking it because it makes me feel awful, and medication is a temporary fix to a permanent problem.

Anyway, I told my boss how I felt about what I'm working on, and everything just came out.  I couldn't stop my emotions for what must have been only 5 minutes, but it felt like forever.  He knows I've recently been through a divorce, and I've been trying to limit it's effect on my work.  I feel so ashamed and embarrassed.

It also gotten to the point that it can be the thing to ruin my day. A homeless dude came up to me and asked randomly what I studied, I reply and of course he has no clue what I'm saying so I had to repeat myself two times. He asked my uni and by some miracle he hears me the first time(just about, he had to pause for 5 seconds to process what I said) and tells me that I should be ashamed I go there. I nodded and walked off, and I spent the day annoyed he couldn't understand me. I've tried slowing down, articulating my word, doing all kinds of stuff and nothing works.

56,"I live in Brazil, so that's a pretty big start.

Stupid people at the Congress are trying to (almost done actually) create a law that, basically, legalizes the Outsource of *every single profession*. HOW CAN THEY DO THIS?? Those employees are paid less; they have even less money. They buy less. Owners of business gain less money. The whole country enters a colossal crisis. Yay.

Plus, along with the crisis going on, a new law was *approved*: you can only retire after paying Social Security for 49 YEARS. The average person starts work at 20. 20+49=69. The average life expectation is 74 years. So, the average person retires at 69 years old; they paid 10X for 49 years - to receive 6X for 5 years. Doesn't that seem favorable??

Now, there's some shit going on: they put *cardboard paper* in meat, so it's more consistent. Plus all the rotten meat sold, the cancerous products put to conserve it... BUT do you wonder why this all came about NOW? Because the scandal called ""Car Wash"" (an operation arresting corrupt people) is too big. They want to address the people's attention to the food scandal. I have to go in 5 minutes, but, if I could, I would say even more real shit about my country. I'll try to update, though.

Update: the minimum salary here is R$900, equivalent to $300 dollars. The salary of a cop is from R$2000 to R$3500 ($666 to $1166 dollars). This is why there was the day the cops didn't work, in Espírito Santo: the whole fucking town went to the retail stores to steal. To steal.  
Well, and the salary of a deputy, benefits excluded, is R$30k (US$10k). With benefits, it goes well over R$150k (US$50k). I don't know the salary of a deputy in America; my point here is that a big percentage of the population earns $900, while there are people who make $150k. More than a 100 times. Why?

Oh, also, there's the thing that 80% of the country's roads are not paved. 80%.  
Also, only 90% of the population has electricity.  
Also, 50% *doesn't have* sewer pipes anywhere near their houses.

They want to remove History and Geography from the obligatory classes. A country of stupid people with their minds on football.

Oh, there's also the stadium corruption: Corinthians, a football club, received a sponsorship from the Federal Bank (which is illegal, since the government can't give money to private initiatives). Turns out the club owner made a deal with someone important, and he was receiving benefits. Corinthians received, as a gift (with the pretext of ""We are building it for the Olympics""), a whole stadium. For free.

Did I mention that the government cut support to ""Science Knows No Bounds"" (free translation), a project that used to give money to students in foreign universities? And that those students had to interrupt their studies, because they couldn't pay for it?

I've recently took stock of my social situation and my own self-esteem as a person and come to the conclusion that A) I don't have many friends and B) I play up this whole persona of a stud because I like having sex but place too much importance on it in absence of anything else meaningful going on in my life right now.

It all kinda started with a girl (doesn't it always) who we'll call B.
B is hot, 4 years older than me and really open about sex which I love. Asked her for a drink, got turned down because of a situation with a different guy...whatever.

B has a house party last weekend which I go to, because I figured I had a chance to get laid but also because I need more friends XD
Long story short, we fuck, there's an orgy and it's great.
However, now I can't get her or it out of my head which is pissing me off. I can't see myself asking this girl out for a drink again, nor do I want to get rejected again, but I also want something more with her...

It was just sex with one girl, it probably won't go further so why is it such a big deal to me? And that's when I realised I place too much emphasis on who I sleep with, and that whilst I'm a confident guy I find myself always looking for my next lay to the point a dry spell really knocks my confidence...

And the one girl who I'd stop sleeping around for, ironically loves sleeping around as much as me so likely it won't happen.

No.  It was very sweet.  It was rubbing up against my legs and sat in my lap and purred when I sat down.  

After 20 minutes, I continued my ride.  I couldn't stop thinking about this cat.  It was so skinny and there was a cold spell forecasted.  You could see it's ribs and it's shoulder bones stuck out its back.  It could have been on one of those abused animal commercials with Sarah McLaughlin.

On my way back home, the cat was still in the same spot.  I stopped and it ran over to me when I called.  That was it, I was going to adopt this cat.  I had 20 miles to go and no place for a cat on my bike.  I was going to come back with my car and cat food later.

When I got back with food, it was starting to get dark and was already in the upper 30's.  The cat was gone.  I left the food and hoped someone had given this cat a warm place to sleep.
