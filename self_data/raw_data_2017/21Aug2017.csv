3,"I am an extremely easy going person, even when I get mad/frustrated with something/someone it only lasts a short time I don't dwell on things if someone does something wrong to me I usually get upset for a short while and just don't talk to them or anyone else for a short while, and I just move past it, i kind of hate it at times because often I don't know if it's something I should be more upset about or if it's minor? I am horrible with confrontation I generally don't confront anyone about anything.

My wife hates this because she perceives me as not caring about anything but I just have a hard time being mad about something for a long time, I look at it as not letting 1 thing ruin a week/day.

I mean I guess I just posted this because I want to know like....is there something wrong with me? ",21Aug2017,2
5,"Preamble. Often times you'll be given the advice ""The worst [they] could do is say no,"" now this is bad advice. All dating advice is bad advice, because dating is the most subjective and situational aspect of life. Where am I going with this?

 Well, I don't know if some people just never had strong emotional feelings or just rarely get rejected, but people don't understand that it isnt about the response at all. There's no difference to me if they say ""sorry, your not my type"" or ""Fuck off loser."" 
It's the fact that I spent so much time and immeasurable stress building up a shred of confidence to tell someone they mean the world to me and they couldn't give less of a shit. I have to deal with their perception of me forever changed, and you just cant talk to each other normally after that, every thought, every exchange is augmented by the knowledge that your in love with them. Things will never be the way they were before and the best you can do is pretend it never happened. Suddenly what you thought might be a bright moment for your life may be the catalyst to the end of a friendship. It's much more than them just saying ""no,"" in fact the word itself is almost irrelevant.

 So *the worst* isn't a rejection, the worst is much more horrible than that.",21Aug2017,2
6,"I'm worried about my mother. For the past year or so, she has been having chest pains and shortness of breath. I've been telling her to go to the doctor, but she doesn't want to because she's afraid it'll be to expensive (she doesn't make much money and has cheap insurance). Just yesterday, she had a pain that felt like a crick in her neck. It occurred suddenly after she went up into our attic to check something. The next day, the pain in her neck spread into her shoulders and then her chest. I just convinced her to get a doctor's appointment, but I'm worried that maybe she should go to the hospital instead.

Now, here's another thing that's bothering me: My father and mother divorced a long time ago, and he remarried. He claims my stepmother has had many dreams that came true. She once dreamt of a coffin and a cross, and shortly thereafter, my grandfather passed away. She dreamt that her aunt passed away as well, and it happened, though the details aren't clear.

Just today, my father told me that my stepmother, who has never met my mother, had a dream that my mother died. I don't believe in prophetic dreams, but the timing is freaking me out. Can anyone perhaps walk me through the reasons why the dream doesn't mean anything? I'm having a little trouble being a skeptic at the moment.",21Aug2017,6

9,"After going back to school and changing careers, I'm looking to a rent a room and start a new job soon.  Most of the rooms I've seen to rent are in private homes.  I met the parents at one place.  They have 2 teen daughters (16 and 19 yo), plus 2 renters (one young woman and a guy possibly in his mid 20s).   I think the parents are in their 40s.  I'm in my 30s.

What's great about the place are their pets, I love animals.   Apparently the 3 room renters get to use a ground floor bathroom and the family (2 parents, 2 girls) use the basement one.  The room to rent is in the basement so I'd have to go upstairs to use it.  If I have to use a bathroom urgently, I can use the family one in the basement, but only for emergencies.  That sucks but what I'm more concerned about is sharing the space with the girls while keeping my distance, avoiding conflict , but remaining friendly.   They also have a hot tub in one room (a converted garage) that's reached on the way to the renter's bathroom so there could be incidents where I see the daughters in their swimsuits...again I want to avoid any awkward moments.     Should I avoid this place and find somewhere with more adults and a better bathroom to renter ratio?

Apparently the parents seem pretty open minded to have an unrelated male sharing their home with their daughters - I know another homeowner whose ex-wife forbid male renters on the same floor as their teen daughter.   The parents I met even said it's OK if I invite a gf over for the night (and she sleeps over).  Am I the one who's uptight thinking drama with those teen girls could develop?  I get that they use the family bathroom and I'm not to use it, so that's a way for them to have their space, but still.  Looking for tips on how to act ""chill"" around the parents and girls.  One thing I noticed today when speaking with the mom is how she had a bra strap that fell off her shoulder and she grabbed it and propped it under her blouse.  I tried my best to look her in the eyes or above her head ...again for respect, but maybe she saw my eyes move to the right of her face and saw that loose strap?   I don't want to be accused of anything I didn't do around those girls.  The parents know where I'll be working, the employer name, even someone working there...so they could somehow mess with my job.  I dunno...maybe I'm too paranoid / uptight? ",21Aug2017,2
10,"I've completely screwed up. I had all my jobs ending in 2016 instead of 2017. In one case a job was from September 2016-June 2016.

11,"I'm a mess, there's no other word or description that would currently - or ever - summarise me better.

Ever since I realised the messiness of my existence, I did what everyone would try first, I started to sort things out, clean up and occasionally swiped things under the carpet for temporary mess-storage. Solid system... if you're cleaning your neglected flat from the remains of your own laziness and large amounts of 'not-really-caring', but as most people know: Cleaning is hard, keeping it clean is even harder. 

As it turns out, adapting your superficial, half-assed cleaning scheme from kitchen sinks and dusty bookshelves to your own - and entire - life isn't the most effective way to achieve self-improvement. But hey, eventually even the biggest idiot is able to notice flaws if they are right up in his face for over 20 years, at least he does when that bulge below his life's carpet starts to erupt like a wonderful volcano shouting '*You fucked uuuup!~*' as it lays its burning ashes all over his seemingly neatly cleaned life.
So all of a sudden everything was grey, dull, unrecognisable and covered in messes I had forgotten about for ages and I rolled up in a little, shivering ball of self-pity, hoping to be engulfed in flames and ashes and eventually excavated like the people of Pompeii, leaving behind a relic, a memorial for the generations to come, neatly labelled with a sign that says: 'Unknown mess, A.D. 2016 - Please don't step on it, we don't take responsibility for damage to your shoes.'

And really, I wanted it to end, I didn't see a way out of it, just wanted to stay there and wait for something to deliver me from my misery which had always been there, but now it was out in the open and shouting at me at the top of its lungs. If it hadn't been for certain obligations and promises that I'd made towards others, I would've done exactly that. 
But I couldn't, so I started to navigate the dark seas of self-hatred and overwhelming waves of regret under the star-free sky of utter nihilism with a compass crafted from the last pieces of respect I had for my own existence, not because it was mine, but because it was an existence I felt obligated to somehow continue.

I got nowhere, just rotating pointlessly like a fidget spinner in the hands of an underachieving child called 'Life'. 
In slowly giving up all hope, I realised something about giving up in general. You can give up in several ways, first of them is pretty straight forward, you just give up. The second one is kind of a cop-out on giving up, as it comes, during the process of giving up, to a point at which you might - and just *might* - realise that everything being pointless and hopeless, reaching rock bottom, also means that there is no reason *not* to continue, while simultaneously, of course, meaning that there is no point in continuing. You become the Schrodinger's Cat of giving up, the quantum state of 'Giving a fuck', so to speak.

I did what I never wanted to do, never did before actually, possibly out of pride and the illusion that there was any self-respect to begin with that I could preserve that way - I sought help. Looking back, I doubt that I really found it in the way I needed it or would've shouted rough descriptions of into the blank night sky above me, out of frustration, even though I knew that a receiving end didn't exist. But I found something, a temporary crutch to climb the summit of Mount Mess, to at least get a nice scenic view of the wasteland my life had turned into. That climb took about half a year and there I was, standing on rubble, looking down on rubble, made of rubble and starting to realise that all rubble looks the same, seamlessly stretching over everything as a thin, brittle skin, like the skin of an old lady which lines and wrinkles look like a topographic map, streaked with blueish rivers of veins that barely seem to be able to hold the blood that flows inside of them. But my rubble-map seemed to be missing these streams, these signs of life navigating the valleys and canyons, nothing a doctor could puncture with a well placed needle to suck a few drops of life out of it.

And then it hit me, like a freight train hits that unfortunately parked truck on the tracks, splitting it in half, littering the area with whatever it transported (Let's be serious, it's probably fidget spinners.) - There was never life to begin with, there was never blood to be sucked, I never started to fill these riverbeds with anything, I just concentrated on reorienting and redirecting messes from A to B. There was no person below that rubbish surface to emerge out of it in all of his glory, nothing to wait for to break the surface like a whale taking that long awaited breath after dwelling in the depths for ages. I, I wasn't. I had created a heap of things with my name-tag on them, but who was behind ""Hello my name is: *blank*"", the last person to know the answer to that was me.

A realisation like that should probably be devastating on top of all of that, but it wasn't. Of course there was regret, the thought of 'I should've done it all differently', but in the end - tracing back to the second type of giving up - it set me free from the mess below, it would always be there as a reminder, it would never go away as there was no person linked to it to really be able to clean it up, like Old New York in Futurama, it would forever dwell below the surface, inhabited by those mutant creatures that resemble my failure, the remains of my misguided experiments to become a person. But regardless of all of that below, I could start and - at least try - to build a person now, naturalise the wasteland, not with things from the past converted into shitty images of what should be, but with actual, new things that would seem like they belong there.

I started a process of self-discovery, trial and error and most importantly: Mess prevention. And all in all... well, lets just say: I failed miserably. I fell down Mount Mess several times, climbed back up, started to fill up some of those rivers just to watch them dry out again, planted trees throughout the landscape of my new 'me' and they looked utterly lonely. There was effort, there actually was a sense of hope and there were discoveries throughout that journey, that occasionally made me smile and kept me going. But in the end, you can't build something out of nothing and expect it to be perfect or even decent, or acceptable, or anything you wanted if what you want isn't a life in the style of a Mad Max car, build from all of the crap that wastes away on some junkyard. It might be cool for a while, but in the end, you're driving a rattling piece of rusty old shit that can break down any minute, and break down it did, again. 

So this story is a circle, there's no point to it, or hope to be taken from it, right? Wrong. Neither of those.
Today I had a conversation with my closest friend, we have been struggling maintaining our friendship what it once was ever since the eruption of my messy life-carpet, as I was just broken and distracted from that point on. But once in a while that old feeling of belonging together and being understood shines through and throws a warm light into the room, letting that rubble around me look a bit less intimidating for a moment.
In that conversation a very meaningful sentence was said, that set of a chain reaction of 'clicks' in my head, like pouring glue into the cracks of the broken vase you carefully put together and have been looking at for ages, wondering what was missing to make it a vase again, finally fixing it. Without seeming bitter, angry or trying to be hurtful, she said: 'If I would meet you now, I don't think we would become friends.' Completely contrary to what I would think this sentence would've done to me a while ago, it felt warm and uplifting, a weight being lifted and something very important reassured within me.

I might not be a joyful, error-free person, with a life that is under control and no mess around himself. I'm also no good at creating myself from scratch, I can't just float above my life and ignore it to concentrate on building things with no foundation that will eventually and unavoidably crash to the ground. Not because ignoring your life isn't helpful at times, but you can't selectively cancel out parts of it without cancelling it out all at once. Of course I don't want to look at my mess every day, but within that mess, even though I don't see him and maybe never will, still lies a person that others might see, recognise and like. Those who find you inside of your personal wasteland and yet manage to obtain your sympathy, as well as give their own, are the ones you should turn to when seeking for help, or a map. They navigated your shitty dump to find you within, they probably know the way out. I didn't realise that for a far too long time, thinking all of those who dwelled upon those forsaken territories were part of the problem, just manifestations of my mess which should be discarded as well.
For a while, I left them behind, climbed mountains and tried to play God over my own life, not knowing that those I left below would eventually drown if my plans succeeded and those rivers would've filled up. My mess is and will always be my mess, but I can never make it other people's mess or leave them to drown within it.
I changed, as I tried to, but I failed at changing for the better and looking back on what I started changing from, I didn't ever want to go back. But if the only thing that I have back there are a few familiar and well-meaning souls that see the person I'll never be able to see in myself, I'll gladly stop trying to fix unfixable shit and go back to my messy home which at least has company that doesn't mind the bulge below my carpet as they navigate around it with a friendly smile on their face as if it wasn't there. 

Yet, of course, I'll need to fix things eventually, but I tried giving up and it wasn't what I thought it was, I also tried escaping it all with no effect and nearly lost what I forgot was still good about all of the shit I lived in. Time will tell, but for some reason, I feel well now. Free from my quest to leave it all behind, yet accompanied in my little base-camp back at the foot of Mount Mess.

(Is there a point to all of this rambling? I don't know. Maybe you find one in there, maybe you don't. I just felt like writing about it and if you like or hate it, feel free to let me know.)

12,"Back in 8th grade i was going through alot and it slowly built up on me. I eventually resorted to suicide and when my parents found out i had taken a bunch of medications i was immediately taken to the hospital. I was kept there overnight and was then driven in an ambulance to a mental hospital. At this point (driving there) i still didnt care about my life and i wanted to die. It felt like there was nothing left to live for. Then comes the EMS guy who was in the ambulance with me. He talks to me about his life in the military and his buddies as well. I learned about their hardships and how several of them killed themselves. He told me that he had seriously considered suicide as well and that instead he chose this (EMS) so he could save lives instead. He told me how young i was and how much i still had to live for. He then played music for me for the rest of the trip and calmed me down and let me find a reason to live again. He didnt have to do any of that but he did and it is the reason im still here today. I just wish i could thank him for how he changed my life. I don't remember his name, face or anything but he did so much for me. Thank you EMS guy and thank you to any other out there that go above and beyond their job. Just know your appreciated even if youre forgotten. ",21Aug2017,452

19,"I'm 24, but physically, mentally and emotionally I feel old, decrepit, worn out, as if I have already entered my twilight years. The idea of living for potentially 50-80 more years terrifies me, but it is a fate I hopelessly resign myself to - I have too many people dependant on me after all. But the idea of taking a long, final plunge is beautifully happy to me.

I put on a smile and a humorous attitude to cover this pain, both online and in real life, but every now and then it feels wonderful to peel off the mask and let my inner thousand mile stare show on the outside. Sadly, talk like this gets labels of ""edgelord"" ""emo"" ""cringe"" ""fedora"" and all sorts of other shit that basically says nobody cares, get over it. And for the most part I do. But on nights like tonight when life has become incredibly shitty, I don't give a fuck about appearance, because I desperately need to vent. So, let's start.

As I said, I'm 24. I'm also INTP-T, a high-functioning autist, possible schizophrenia and who knows what else because I'm too poor and busy to go see doctors. I work 39.5 clocked hours a week at a job that refuses to give me a set schedule, keeps my hours at awkward times so they inevitably eat up the whole day, schedules me for big lunch breaks (that I never get) so I actually stay at the job for much longer than the hours scheduled, your standard corporate fuckery. On top of that, the work is physically and mentally taxing to the point of it sending my supervisor to the hospital for a stroke and aneurysm last week.

But I can't leave this job, it took me two years of hustling up random handyman work while applying for actual jobs to get it. I have a disabled father who is being screwed out of his disability benefits, a psychotic narcissist mother who violently refuses to help pay the bills because she did work for a couple of years 30 years ago and she raised us and that's good enough for her, a sister with poor mental health my mother can't help but get into physically, emotionally and psychologically abusive screamfests with (and she also works two jobs to try and help us survive) and a very old furry friend I've been too poor to take proper care of (and it fucking guts me every single day that I couldn't afford a good life for her).

I live out in the wilderness, away from all civilization. The land is paid for, and so is our single wide mobile home. But that doesn't mean that life is easy - the debt my mother has accumulated makes us barely squeak by on the money that trickles through our hands from those we work for into the hands of those we owe. In fact, right now I'm overdrawn, so if my father continues to be screwed out of his disability benefits, we'll be penniless within a week 

It has been this way my entire life. I started working for the family when I was 14, and I have rarely seen a dollar I have earned in the decade since, and I feel incredibly guilty - and then am made to feel guilty by my parents - whenever I do spend the occasional dollar on me. We don't even have electricity - I have to continually provide gas for a cheap generator that barely runs enough fans to partially stave off some of the immense heat that sometimes floods the house and makes it unbearable to stay inside. One of those fans sits right at my window, and it sucks in a million bugs onto my bed every night. I brush them off before I go to sleep, but I always know more will be coming in as I sleep. Oh, and my ceiling has developed a leak that is beginning to grow mold.

I was born with a bad back and legs, but I developed two wonderful new conditions within the last five years. The first is a shrunken esophagus that makes choking happen on almost every other meal, the second are cluster headaches that last in several-month-long stretches at a time. But I am too poor and too busy to go see a doctor. When I did go to a doctor for the clusters, I waited six hours and was then told to take advil and to have a nice day because I didn't have health insurance. My narcissistic mother happens to be a hardcore christian who tells me Jesus can fix it. Jesus didn't suffer for shit, 12 hours is nothing compared to up to six months of feeling like someone is constantly taking a power drill to your head. Some god he was, if suffering agony makes you a savior of mankind then I have far more experience at that than he ever did.

Now let's add into this open air prison of existence my sexuality. I live in the middle of the country with two very strongly anti-lgbt parents. I tried to come out before, but they said I was pretending and that I was to never mention it again if I wanted to continue having a home. They are my only transportation, and I have no support network to keep from going homeless should they ever kick me out because I live in a state where ""them queers ain't welcome"" and they take almost every penny I earn, which they justify as being the equivalent of paying rent if I was by myself. I will likely never have a love life, and never get to be out. Because of this hopeless situation, and my perpetual exhaustion, I have let myself go. I will never be attractive anyways, not with a carbon copy of my father's brutish mug plastered on my head, so why bother? I don't even deserve a cute guy's love, I'm too hulkish and ugly to even compete with real gay men.

I am perpetually horrified at my existence, and the idea that nothing so far is stopping it from continuing for a very long time, and that there is nothing else I can do to keep from drowning. Eternally living on the edge of falling even further into the abyss of how bad life can get horrifies me even more. I would cry out to a higher power, but if they won't help those who are unthinkably impoverished and deprived, they're not about to help me.

So about that American dream, I'm glad that corporations are undoing every human right imaginable so they can make even more money they never give back out. It really helps knowing that every feeble attempt to reach upwards is always kicked away by those who have more than I do. I can't wait until they create fully automated capitalism and then only those who own the means of production can afford to continue surviving and the rest of us will just have to die of starvation. Knowing that's the future America is headed towards makes continued living worth even less.

I don't know how I can continue existing like this. My mother and sister were just at it again, shrieking at and slapping each other right outside my door. I don't have the energy to break them up.

Life fucking sucks but for some reason I unfortunately continue to exist. I hope every single night to never wake up again, but grievously I always do. It's like fate read Waiting For Godot, The Portrait of Dorian Gray and Dante's Inferno and decided it wanted to make a human that combined all of these into one life. I have no hope, no belief, no confidence in anything but my continued existence. I must have been truly evil in my last life.

I'm so incredibly tired, and I didn't even list all the batshit crazy metaphysical facets of my life that make it even crueler, but hey let's just chalk that up to schizophrenia because that's far simpler.

I'm sorry if this post annoyed or bored you. I don't mean to be a nuisance, I'm just lost, dazed, comfused, disoriented, grieving, angry and in need of a good cry, some sleep, someone who loves me and a lot of money.

You know, as I lie here in my hotel bed, anxiously waiting to have my car fixed, I've begun to wonder what the point is of being violent and disruptive at political demonstrations. The trend towards hatred of each other is startling.  We are Brothers and Sisters united in Christ.  There's no need for hurt or humiliation to convey an opinion.  Those things can be expressed by peaceful demonstration.  But why the rush to judgement of the dissent? Jesus was, among other things, non-judgmental, towards both Jews and Gentiles. He healed those of and not of faith out of God's unconditional love for every person on this earth.  We also can choose to be non-judgmental of people of different races, ethnicities and political ideologies.  You may profess your political belief, but do not surprised the same of someone who disagrees. Let your mind be open; hear them out.  If you disagree thereafter articulate why, but don't resort to using generalities and name calling just so you can have the loudest voice. Know what your position is. Speak with eloquence. Never drive away those in disagreement. Remember, we're all related as God's children. Beating a protester or counter-protestor is the same thing as a parent physically abusing a child because they don't like the cereal you feed them for breakfast.

28,"Well I'm overweight (obese 1st grade). I started my weight loss journey at over 280 lbs. 

I managed to lose 50 lbs in around 3 months only by trying to eat at the same hours and 3 times a day. I used to eat 1 time only and tons or calories so that's why I was fat. 

Anyway I went on 2 trips and I just got back yesterday. 2 weeks and a half where I lost myself in the food again. 

I mean, I had around 210 lbs when I left. I felt great but when I saw that much food and I didn't need to cook it all etc... I just lost my shit. And i ate everything I could. From the unhealthy chips and cakes (it was my birthday too) from fish and salads. 

I think I ate smaller portiona than before otherwise I can't explain why I only gained 1,5 lb in 2 weeks of piggy eating. 

And i am happy!!!! I expected to have +5 lbs from how much I ate. 

I know it's bad I lost my shit. But in the past I used to gain 1 lb/day from eating so uncontrolably. 

I still made my regular small exercices, even though it was not everyday. 

So I am happy and I am back to my diet now. I know it's weird to be happy i gained weight. The idea is that I'm happy I didn't gain so much weight. 

I still have to work on controlling myself on holidays. If I leave my house for more than a few days, I kinda mess up with my healthy routine. So I am learning this everyday. Hopefully I will master the ability to control myself better one day.

I tried forcing myself to be straight for so long and sex with a girl was just so much better than with a guy. I had a ""god, *this* is how it's meant to be"" moment. 

My ovaries had awful timing but just giving and a bit of above the belt stuff for me was so goddamn amazing. Seeing her squirm and close her eyes and arch her back and swear under her breath was the best thing in the whole world

She's, uh, marked her territory and every time I see lovebites in the mirror I get giddy all over again. My neck and chest look like I've been abused and I couldn't be happier. 

I just really like boobs...",21Aug2017,52
32,"Knowing me, my thoughts may change, but for now...

At the start of the year, I was given a ""hall pass"" by my husband. The recipient was going to be his only good friend. After talking with Husband about it, and seeing how much it bothered him, I called it off only hours before Friend was supposed to arrive. 

In the months that followed, Friend and I would text every day and talk about how badly we wanted to be with each other, even just once. It reached a point where I almost considered having an affair. I did not. 

The guys got a busy life, so we don't talk as much or as often as we used to, and yeah, I still care about the guy, he's one of our best friends, but I'm not as desperate for ""it"" now. 

And thank god. Husband wouldn't outright say so, but I know it was eating him up, and our relationship didn't exactly suffer, but he was more distant than usual. 

Maybe now I can actually focus on what's important. It's a relief to be honest. 

Though, as capricious as I am, that may change as soon as tomorrow, but we'll see. ",21Aug2017,0
34,"I can have a seemingly normal day, a small thing kicks off me feeling slightly negative about something, which snowballs and escalates into me feeling more and more down and eventually even my body slows down. It even gets to the point where just moving my hand is tedious and feels pointless.

I can't snap out of it, I have no motivation. I have goals and dreams but for some reason, I can't pursue them. I should go out for a walk during the day while it's nice out but... Can't be bothered.

Should cook, but I can't be bothered.

Everything feels like a waste of time because one action can't solve all my problems. I know that's unreasonable and I know everytime I actually get to cracking on one issue, my apathy fades. But I can't convince myself to do it. I know if I go to workout and then cook, I'll feel great again even though it didn't solve all my problems. But I just can't be bothered.

Right now I really want to just Alt+f4.",21Aug2017,2

40,"Long story short, as a young teen I could not wait to go to college. I did. I got into the course, the college even the accommodation and I saw the vision I had at 14 come to life when I was at a party. The only difference was I was not at all happy.

I failed 3 exams, I did not do continuous assessment, I did not go to lectures I assumed I'd drop out.
I get my results next week from my repeats, I could have passed, I'm not sure.

If I pass, I have no accommodation sorted which means living with my parents and an hour and a half bus to and from college every day, every day spent sitting around the campus, since I can't just go home so 8 am till 6pm every day sitting about between the intermittent lectures.

I have lost all contact with my friends from college, I tried to sort out accommodation with two who are living together but they're keeping the place for a friend possibly coming in this year..

My other option is to drop out, go home, I have to wait a whole year to reapply. 
Being 20 years of age and sitting around at home with my parents sounds like torture. I can (already do) hear the constant nagging sounds of 'you're a waster', unambitious, useless, just a waste.. If I was at home I would not have a minute to myself, I'd have to deal with parents over analysing every detail about my life and just when I'm feeling slightly less shitty I'd hear 'what made you this way? Why are you so bitter, you were a lovely child, now you're spiteful'.

So what the fuck do I do, honestly, because fuck me if I know.

I've thought of getting trade, but my parents see it as below me, I was a gifted student, got on very well for someone who did nothing, I got into a great college, I just fucked up.
I hate virtually all aspects of my life.

I can not see eye to eye with my parents, I was just a friend of a friend who hung around, not actually part of the group, no one invites me, no one wants to talk to me.. every conversation is just a exchange of facts. 
I've talked to them one on one, the girls say I'm very smart, every says I'm quiet, that they never knew I had anything to really say. I never feel apart of anything.
I have grown so far apart from my old friends because to be quite frank I am fucking sick of hearing the same jokes over and over again.

I am tired of dealing with the same alcohol inflated ego every night we go out, I'm fucking sick and tired of everything going on. 

I could not wait to get out of school, I could not wait to actually do something I wanted to do. Now I'm out, I don't know what to do.

I had such grand ambitions. I want to start a company, I want to do something I enjoy, I want to make a lot of money, I want to be able to afford what I want, I want to work because I enjoy it not just because I have to.
But instead I'm a 20 year old who gets told by girls he's the smart guy they know but he's just crippled with depression, crippled in virtually all aspects of life, I can drink and act fine but I wake up the same shitty way as I was before.
I am lost, I don't know what to do.

42,"We are these grand animals biologically designed to live in sophisticated social structures. At least the very existence of our elaborate system of morality, derived from evolutionary processes over millennia, seems to be a strong argument behind regarding it as an adaptation system. What’s new is the concept of individualism. And what’s fairly new in human history is where this idea lies within our society – and how do we resolve associated issues of free will, mutual and/or individual responsibility, objective truth or objectivism itself. After all – whatever is individual cannot be very objective, but we’re so hooked up on self-rewarding individualism, we disregard the fact our actions are often perceived as virtuous only by our splendid-selves and our closest circles of mutual admiration.

All of our judgements, decisions or interpretations of (supposedly) objective truths – are sifted through our cultural, historical, biological and mental background buried deep beneath our awake minds, in the midst of vast unknown of collective unconsciousness. 

May it be that what we call our conscious-self, apparently disconnected from fundamental human drives wired in our brains, is a mere illusion? Ape’s adaptation to an evolutionary by-product? Does it make it any less miraculous? 

It doesn’t, if you ask me.

I found one of the most intricate variations of this idea, among others (i.e. Jung’s cultural ideas concept or modern meme theory) –in one of the masterpieces of modern literature: Ian McEwan’s 'Atonement'.

When Briony reflects that ‘behind the smooth continuous fabric was the real self – was it her soul? – which took the decision to cease pretending, and gave the final command.’, while flexing her fingers in the first chapters of the novel – in this brief moment, in this single line of thought - she imposed on me a certain line of interpretation. If we don’t know when does our seemingly independent decision-making ability escape the biological mechanism – can we really trust ourselves to the extent our arrogant human nature would like to allow (or: encourage) us to?

What is universally right and not entangled in the modern complexities of socially differentiated cultures?

And then what follows (also as one of the questions in the novel itself) - what consequences can a spoken word have? What is the acting power of the articulated word? Word that carry meaning, which may have been born from no more than a mere impulse that came to be in the pits of our brains? And eventually – isn’t it terrifying we may be atoning for the rest of our lives for an inadequate word? Word that may have ignited a small-scale, but gradually escalating cultural conflict, and driven our life into chaos.

Words create our human world. We’re storytellers. This is how our realities, cultures and civilizations are being created. All build upon ideas.  

Jung said that, quite frankly – it’s not people that come up with ideas. It is the ideas – Jungian Archetypes, that possess us. We retell them. And this retelling, through using words rooted deeply in our individual upbringing and cultural make-up – to describe an idea that is rooted deeply in human biology: this I can describe only as a lyric, blindfolded search for an unknown item. This is how ape’s biological adaptation becomes a wonder and a weaved rainbow.

Idea of free will, idea of virtue, idea of atonement, of guilt, punishment , hurt, blame and shame, idea of control over a piece of the world.. - all ideas in a human mind. Stories of the natural storytellers.

Not leaving 'Atonement' behind, but rather intertwining it with a novel as alien to it as it’s physically possible (but through their immense differences in subject-matter and having something more fundamental in common, they do suggest that Jungian Archetypes really possess our modest minds) – I will leave things at an excerpt from Spanbauer’s ‘The Man Who Fell In Love With The Moon’. Fragment I came across at the very start of my personal atonement:

‘Here’s a story: life is a dream. It’s all a story we’re telling ourselves. Things are dreams, just dreams, when they’re not in front of our eyes. What is in front of our eyes now, what you can reach out and touch, now, will become a dream.

The only thing that keeps us from floating off with the wind is our stories. They give us a name and put us in a place, allow us to keep on touching.’

44,"This isn't going to be a very long post, just something I wanted to share that the person that cuts my hair shared with me. 

She's not much older than me, only 26-27ish and I'm 17. I told her how I'm nervous for senior year of high school and that I wasn't sure if I was going to do well. I basically told her how I was scared my future might not be what I want it to be.

She made a really interesting point that I'm not going to forget. She pointed out that that ""butterflies in your stomach"" feeling is the same for anxiety and for excitement. As we both have pretty bad anxiety, we can vouch for this. Anyways, if you have that feeling and it's making you feel insecure or anxious in a bad way, then try and think of it in a positive way. In my case, instead of thinking about how bad senior year can go, i should use those ""butterflies"" to get excited to be leaving high school and starting college next year.

This really opened my eyes. I had never thought of that feeling in that way before. This was only a couple days ago, but it has actually helped me curb my anxiety about a few things by quite a bit. 

Thanks for reading if you did.",21Aug2017,2

49,"I have lived about a two-thirds of a normal lifespan. The idea of living the final third to it’s natural conclusion fills me with such despair and hopelessness I cannot bear it.

I live with the unrealistic internalized expectations of my parents and societal pressures resulting in extreme efforts to prove I am not a bad person, that I deserve to love and live, that somehow if I do enough for others, work as hard as I can for others, somehow the pain of disappointment and failure will go away.

But it never does.

I am very tired and obligation is not enough to carry me another two or three decades. I lack the resolve to end my life or the will to abandon my it. In the past I’ve tried to drown the pain in alcohol or binging food, but no matter how pass-out drunk or fat I got, obligation made me overcome it.

Someone close to me offered the Maya Angelou quote “I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” to explain why their feelings were more important that the damage they were doing to themselves and our future and I understand them and everyone else now.

It’s all about manipulation. All the years of effort and struggle were wasted. My life is a pointless waste of time and energy. I wish I would die.

52,"I don't know if this has been an ongoing phenomenon or it's just more recently being uncovered with the emergence of technology and social media... but it appears to me that there is a small cult of ignorance that seems to be self perpetuating itself online. I see it with horribly sad comments such as ""the earth is flat"". It is deeply troubling to me that as a man of science and an educator that there is a aggressive resistance to reason among a small but pesky group of people. (Recorded) Science and history is a culmination of the great achievements and discoveries made over thousands of years, and for some small groups to willingly toss concrete and accepted ideas in the trash so easily makes me very sad.
