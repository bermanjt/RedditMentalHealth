0,"There's a subreddit that makes fun of Indians and it makes me livid. I don't have a low self esteem but people call me a ""sad beta male"" when I go defensive on my own identity. If someone called a black guy the n word I'm sure he'd be pissed. When people make fun of my race don't I have the same right to be offended and shouldn't it be validated? I think people who tell me to calm down know they're being racist but want to side step instead of apologise. ",20Jun2017,5

3,"My dad didn't abandon me, he was part of my life as a child. He's a criminal however, and a repeat convict. I haven't seen him since I was a 10, after my mother passed away. I remember he tried to shame me because, I hadn't gotten him anything for fathers day. We went to the movies together and afterwards he mentioned I didn't get him anything.

I haven't seen or spoken to him directly since then and it's been a long time. I don't think of him much, I live with my grandparents and I love them and they me. I looked up my last name to see who else had it, since it's fairly unique; at least in the US. I saw his profile and a few pictures.

I shouldn't feel like I do, it brought back so many feelings that I hadn't thought about or felt in so long. It's mostly negative, just sadness and some resentment. I don't want to and, I want to forget it but I can't right now. I don't know what to do now, I feel lost and depressed.",20Jun2017,26
4,"When I was 5, I was struggling with the simple task of tying my shoes. I was a smart child and it bugged me to ne ends. I decided to burrow an illustrated book about knots at the local library. Soon, I developped a fascination about knots and I could knot my shoes like a champ. My grandpa taught me more knots to my childish delight, including the knot they used in public executions. He asked me never to use it and I never nderstood why. Now I'm 25 struggling with addiction and I can't stop thinking about the sweet irony of using it as a way out.",20Jun2017,9
6,"I know exactly who I'd like to be. I know the characteristics I want to possess. Part of me thinks that there's a way that I can achieve that, but as each day goes on, everything stays more the same.

I want to make it clear that my expectations are all within the realm of reality. I want to be kinder, I want to be more friendly, I want to be more energetic. I want to be confident and self-aware. I am starting graduate school soon where I will meet a whole slew of new people that I will spend the next 3+ years with. This is the perfect opportunity and I know that it is a slow process.

I envision a bright, friendly girl who makes others happy. Someone who is nice to everyone. But I am still a quiet, unconfident person. I have made great progress in the last few years, but how can I pragmatically achieve my goal?",20Jun2017,3
7,"So, the question stands. I have never believed throughout my life. I do, however, agree with the taught principles and morals, absolutely. The reason for wanting to attend is to find some sort of family within - with peers and people in general who are just genuinely good people overall. A little elaboration: I've cut out a ton of people from my daily life who I don't think I should be surrounding myself around and I'm pretty much down to my best friend, his wife, and their 3yo son. I always get the feeling that I am pretty much alone and can't seem to find other people I would genuinely enjoy being around. Sure, I could go out at night and drink beers and talk to many people (there's really not much to do in my city except bars and casinos - social things, rather. People just kind of keep to themselves) - but I've done that, a lot, and none of them are people I would actually call up on a Saturday afternoon wanting to hang out or do something. A friend who moved to Alaska actually referred me to a non denominational church she went to, so the plan is to go this Sunday and maybe try and find a young adult group to get involved with. Is this a okay thing to do?",20Jun2017,5

Does that mean I've been breathing the wrong way my whole life?

33,"Been chasing my career for ten years moving around. Started hating moving so when I took the job I have now, I bought a house. I was so focused on not failing financially that I never even thought about living close to my parents.

Now my wife and two kids and I are settled about 6 hours from my parents and 2 hours from hers.

Long story short: my dad gets Parkinson's and is deteriorating. He's not great at taking care of himself and my mom does her best , but he's fallen down the stairs twice. 

I feel like I've abandoned him. I don't know how to support him and I'm so far away, I feel like I've abandoned him. He's a good man and to think of him struggling every day , without me there to help or to share my life w him- I feel really hart broken.",20Jun2017,1
36,"We all heard about how many calories an adult needs every day ( can't put out any numbers here since every source I look at says something different  BUT let's say an adult male should take in about 2500kcal a day) and as every other person, I have my ups and downs. What I struggle the most with when I am not feeling quite on top is eating. I can go days without barely eating anything, but it always ends up in a food orgie after a few days of starving. Say I put in an avarage of 500cKals on my bad days, and then I'll make the feast of the week which has 6000ckal, so in 3 days I get the ''correct'' amount of kcal, just distributed very badly...

38,"Last week on vacation [I accidentally had sex with my sister in law](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/6h4hh0/i_fcked_up_and_losing_my_mind_nsfw). I'm back home and never been happier for a vacation to end. This was the most jacked up week of my life!

Some time has passed and the reality of the situation has started to sink in. I spent the past week going over this in my head. I cheated on my wife. Thinking back, I definitely knew something wasn't right. Her body felt a bit different. She was more aggressive than usual. Things were just off a bit. Nothing major but enough that I knew in my head it was different. I should have known but I fucked her anyway.

Plus I spent the past week thinking about her sister. I find myself staring at her or getting aroused whenever I'm around her. She's around a lot at home but on vacation we were together constantly. How the hell do I get her out of my head? Is this going to stop? The other day I couldn't have sex with my wife. We started kissing and I started rubbing her breasts I started thinking about her sister. I had to make up an excuse and stop. I had an erection from here to China but the guilt made me sick to my stomach.

If I can't figure out how to get over the guilt then I think I need to confess to what I did. Is this a stupid idea? I feel guilty that I look at her sister differently now. I feel guilty that I enjoyed the sex. I feel guilty about her husband. I'm afraid I'm going to slip and say something. I think it's better that I tell her rather than they find out because I slip or whatever. I'm not sure how they will react. I positive it won't be good either. How do I get rid of the guilt?",20Jun2017,3

53,"So I'm on my way out.  Not *immediately* but soon I won't be experiencing anything anymore.  No one in my personal life knows it, and that's how I want it to stay for now.  I'd rather not share a lot of info, but let's say I have 3-4 months before checkout time.  I'm pretty fucking poor (nothing of value to sell either), and I'm financially reliant on a family member despite being almost 40.  I would like to pay off this debt somehow while I'm still around to do so.  Actually, even if I could somehow pay it off postmortem, that's cool too.  I don't have any life insurance and getting some is not an option.  I've even tried taking out a ""loan,"" but my credit is shit, and even if it weren't, when I'm gone that debt gets laid on my family too!  

I just want to thank this family member for having had to put up with me for so long, and give them something back for everything they gave me.  Something they can use to improve their life.  Not just a kind sentiment, but... the currency of well being in this society: money.  As far as financial support, it's been a one-way relationship, and that kills me.  No pun intended.  So I want to reciprocate somehow while I still have a chance. 

I've been trying to think of good ways for a person who doesn't care about the personal consequences of their actions (because they won't be around long enough to have to deal with them) to get some decent money.  There's obvious (which are often also obviously stupid) things like: ""rob a bank!  The worst that could happen is you get shot and die a little bit sooner than anticipated.""  However, I really don't want to be the cause of any real harm to other people, and bad shit can happen during a robbery.  And I know I'd fuck up robbing a bank anyway.  Putting MYSELF in a dangerous or painful situation is fine, though.  

I have a few other more realistic ideas, but my intention in posting this wasn't to list my own ideas which probably suck, but to see if denizens of reddit had some good thoughts on the matter.  I don't mind suffering quite a bit, but it has to be within reason.  No, I can't prostitute myself out, even if I were attractive (I'm anything but), I couldn't make enough for it to be worth it.  I'm thinking a few grand would be a token gesture, but better than nothing.   

So, if you were in a situation like I described, what would you do?  If you were short on time, literally had nothing to lose, but wanted to give back to someone who deserves more than the death of a loved one after their years of selflessness... what would you do?  Is there any clever way to make money off one's *own death*?

Also, if anyone knows if there is a more appropriate sub to post this in, please let me know.  Seems a bit too heavy for /r/personalfinance.  

Thanks.",20Jun2017,2
