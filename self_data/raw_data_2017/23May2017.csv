5,"My grandpa just passed 2 days ago and if I did visit him before he died he would have still been alive. I just came back to my home country after finishing my semester overseas and my father did not tell me that my grandpa's condition got a lot worse. He also got out of the hospital just before I arrived so that I didn't have to see him in such state. First time I went to visit him I couldn't hold my tears back and couldn't say much from how bad his condition was. I also went to see my friends before I went to see him which makes me feel terrible. My father told me that his condition got a lot better after I saw him and he started eating again and asked me to keep visiting him. 5 or 6 days go by and I visit him again and this time I actually talk to him and we have a couple of good laughs and I will forever remember our talk. Third night and second night before he passed away my father asked me to visit my grandpa again but I told him I will later, the night before he passed away my grandma called me and asked me to visit him now but I was with my friends and told her again I will later, I picked my friends over him, in my 3 week stay I only visited him twice. I feel terrible for not seeing him, I feel terrible not guessing that his time was soon and not spending as much time as I could with him, I feel terrible for someone loving me so much and me ignoring him so much if I could go back in time I would be incredibly happy. His death came so fast and unexpected it almost feels like it never happened. Why do we ignore those who love us and our elders like that, my grandpa deserved a much better person that who I am.

6,"(Its a bit long, my native language is not English so there are going to be mistakes, and its a bit repetitive too)
I'm very confused. I don't know if it's my fault and i should suck it up because i didn't stop it. But i feel terrible about it.
Last Saturday night, I wasn't very happy and needed someone to go out with, a drinking buddy to go out with. 
So i texted one of my friends that has been my friend for like three years. And i thought we were very good friends with absolutely no attraction for each other, 
He is an extremely religious guy so i never thought he would try anything and i trusted him a lot (sorry for being repetitive ). 
We agreed we were going to one of his friends house and having a beer before heading to a bar. He hugged me a lot while we were sitting but i didn't think much about it, he also made a comment on my boobs, but i didn't think much about it either.
We went to a bar, started drinking more, 
A guy tried to kiss me and I looked at my friend and said thats my friend. And my friend said if I wanted to get rid of him easily I should have said he was my boyfriend. 
Later that night he walked me back to my house. He said he needed a bathroom but i told him he couldn't come to mine because i didn't want my brother to wake up. So we went in the maintenance area of the building and found a bathroom. After that we started talking and he listened to me. I was telling him about the guy that i love, and how about that was true love and that i felt like i was never going to be happy again. and then when we stopped talking he told me he owed me a massage (i asked him for a back massage earlier that night) he put his coat on the floor and told me to lay there and started giving me a back massage first. And thats when things got weird. I was still drunk. He started to ask me if i wanted him to do my legs too and first i said i need it more in my back. but then he asked me again and i said okay, and i was wearing tights. he asked me if he could remove them i fist said it was okay with them on but then he insisted and i said okay its fine. and started giving me massages there. It didn't turn me on at all, it was just relaxing me a bit. then he went back to my head and started massaging my ears, i said i wasn't a big fan of that, and he said thats because they have never done it to me with the mouth. (sounded weird but didn't have the energy to tell him to stop there) then i was about ready to get up and he asked me if there was anywhere else were i needed a massage, and i said on my side because i was stiff. he moved further close to my boob, started asking me if i wanted him to massage my boob or if it made me uncomfortable, i said it made me uncomfortable he kept giving me a massage close to there and said he was going to ask me again if he wanted me to do it. and i said what he was already doing was fine. He started kissing my ear bit harshly. and touching my boob, and all i was thinking was this shouldn't be happening, it wasn't turning me on at all but i didn't have the energy to stop it, couldnt think much. and he was my friend, i didn't want to make it awkward. then someone knocked the door and i was partly relieved because it forced us to react get up fast. And as soon as we stepped out I told him, i didn't know what happened, and he told me it was okay, that i was missing the guy that i loved and needed that so thats why it happened. But he was the one who was actively making it happen, so im confused. If i think about this it grosses me out, i wish it would have never happened, i didn't enjoy it. but i feel bad because i didn't stop it, when i should have i can't blame him because i didn't stop but i didn't want it or liked it either.",23May2017,1

So I'm seeing this shit getting thousands of upvotes.... and I really don't see what the problem is! *Anyone* can beg for money. You don't need credentials to beg for money. Begging is work. Just like taking cans and bottles out of the trash and recycling them for ten cents each is work. Same as giving blowjobs at the bus station is work. Same as digging ditches is work.

Is she lying to people? Absolutely. That's part of the job. Hell, it's part of *every* job. The bar I go to doesn't have ""the coldest beer in town"", the power tool I picked up doesn't ""last twice as long as the competition"", and those pills at the gas station have never made anyone's ""penis"" bigger. *It's called marketing.* No one gets paid with a sign that says ""give me money for no fucking reason in particular"". Yet every single panhandling sign might as well say ""please give me money, and in exchange I will keep your money."" You're just giving out free money, what difference does it make who they are or what they spend it on?

The reason more people don't beg for money is because it pays absolute shit compared to most jobs. Considerably less than minimum wage, at least in my area. So obviously this woman doesn't have a better source of income, otherwise she would be spending her time doing that, right? In fact, many of the people you see panhandling *could* work better paying jobs but they can't get hired because they aren't sober, are disabled, or have a criminal record. Which is kinda fucked up in my opinion.

So explain like I'm five what the big deal is about this rando deciding to get in on the free money express going on at the intersection?",23May2017,1

19,"Ignorance is bliss.

Some background info: I am one of those people with an existential crisis. I'm extremely afraid of death and the fact that my life is going to end. Sometimes I have panic attacks in the middle of the night due to this fear. 
And recently, the notion that life is meaningless has affected my daily life. I can't appreciate things as much anymore. When Arsenal misses out on top four or my Melbourne Demons lose a match I don't feel the frustration that I used to feel. When I walk home from school by myself I am almost emotionless. Talking to my friends is like a type of antibiotics, it helps short term but doesn't solve anything and eventually I'm afraid that it's effectiveness will wane.

I understand that many morbid people have come to reddit and posted their depictions of their fears of death, and what occurs after death.
I've read many of these posts, and thus have been pointed in the direction of different opinions and views on death, including philosophically and scientific articles about death.
I recently read some Richard Dawkins article and blogs about Richard Dawkins' views on death, and the ensuing responses and comments. And to be frank, I find them incredibly pretentious and unfathomable. And frightening.

One commenter said that we are just the result of chemical reactions occurring and that we are all part of a grand process. And that is the most fucking scary part about life. It's a process. The Big Bang occurs, the universe is born. The universe collapses. Rinse and repeat. This process has occurred infinite amount of times and will occur an infinite amount of times. We don't mean anything as all historical records will be abolished.

Richard Dawkins expresses delight at the thought that one day, someone will sit on the grass that grows where his body has been buried. He expresses excitement that the universe is going to continue to grow?

One of my friends told me his philosophy on life. That life is what you make of it. It's like the plank on a pirate ship, that you keep walking and walking until you eventually fall off. How is that supposed to calm my fears? There's still the bloody jump off the plank to be afraid of.

The above notions are terrifying. Completely terrifying. No matter how much I love my parents and my sister and eventually my wife and kids, no matter how much I try to achieve for human society, no matter how much money U earn or happiness I obtain, I mean nothing.

I can't summate into words how fucking ridiculously scary this is. Sometimes I just scream at these prospects; my family asks me what's wrong and I just say that I saw a spider. But obviously it isn't true.

I've considered going to my school counsellor, but I don't think this is an issue for them. They aren't proficient in neuroscience or philosophy or chemistry or physics. Why should I heap this burden on them?
If our consciousness is an illusion, then why have we been given the ability to learn, to change, to adapt, and to mature. What's the point of maturing if there isn't an end result. 

Going back to my first statement. I completely agree with this adage. The joy of being a young boy, the pure anger when I fought with my sister, the pure taste of my parents' cooking. The sadness of my dad leaving to work in China. The disappointment at losing a tennis final. The pure frustration at my teachers.

I'm not even 18. I'm barely mature, but if at this stage of my life, I'm already so scared of the future, then what am I going to be when I fully mature.

Is immaturity a virtue and a blessing?

I really just want to go back to a couple of months ago. No thoughts of death. None completely. Just pure emotions. Pure bliss. Procrastination. Getting slapped by my dad. Punching, and getting punched by my sister. Crying and getting consoled by my mum. The pains of learning Chinese VCE

I can really understand why people are religious. Ten thousand years ago, there is no doubt people were afraid of death, and so they created a fantasy for them to believe in. I completely endorse that and tbh, I'm considering taking up religion. But I really just want to live a normal life. Find love(or not). Have kids. Watch one of my favourite sports teams finally win a title. Get sad after watching an anime.

I also can't understand why our emotions exist in their current state. Our brains are capable of processing so much information and so many thoughts. Why are we equipped with this when it is irrelevant in the end.

To conclude, one of my group of friends on the train said ""That's a depressing topic to talk about,"" when one of us mentioned war and death. And strewth, that's true. 
So how should I go about this? How can I rediscover that ignorance? How can I accept death? How can religion save me?
And what is the chance of this post actually getting seen by someone?
If anyone takes the time to reply and read this post, it is greatly appreciated. Thanks guys.",23May2017,9

27,"Originally posted this to r/talesfromretail, but it has been removed. Can't figure out what rule I violated, so I am going to post here.

So, I worked for a local grocery store. This was a grocery store that almost every person in my area gets their first job in retail at. I had been hired because there was going to be a huge thanksgiving rush (it was a small town and the nearest walmart was miles away), and they needed extra help. So, first job, fresh from orientation, I was ready to go. I was a sackboy. I put groceries into sacks, take them out to peoples cars, and make sure that they are happy as they leave. My first customer was a complete butt. She was a middle aged lady. She had some re usable bags, but after a while, I had completely filled them to the max. So I put them in plastic bags like I was trained to do. Pretty standard stuff, from what it seemed. Then she came back. She let out a little scream, said ""no plastic bags,"" and had me unsack her entire buggy of groceries to put into paper sacks. I was a little put off, but no biggie. That was my job. Make the customer happy. 
Until we left the building. 
The entire way she kept insulting my intelligence, cursing and swearing, calling me stupid, telling me how I am killing the environment and saying I need to go ""back to sacking college."" She said this quite unironically. I asked her what she meant, and she legitimately believed that we went to a college to learn how to put groceries into sacks. I thankfully never saw her again. I stayed at that job for another two years, and to this day, she was one of the rudest customers I have had to deal with.",23May2017,3
28,"I don't know where else to put this and I feel this weird need to broadcast it, so yeah. I'm starting all new. Its like my eyes have been open. I was in some pub with some classmates and I had to leave early. As I left I noticed these two girls looked at me and they quickly starting whispering at one another. You can kinda tell they were saying negative stuff about me. At first I was upset, then I realised something. Can you blame them? To give you picture of how I walked into that pub: I wore this really old dusty jacket, my hat was put on the wrong way(didn't look in the mirror before leaving), despite the deodorant I probably smelt like a skunk as I hadn't showered for a WEEK. and I had this very long and unmaintained beard that made me look homeless. When people tried chatting to me I gave these one word answers and I even when I spoke a little more people found me hard to understand me as I do this weird thing sometimes where I talk more from the back of my throat - I do this out of insecurity about my speech, its silly. When I headed home, I saw the state of my room which had clothes everywhere, pizza boxes, Chinese containers, Two plates with dried up spaghetti sauce and a plethora of empty bottles everywhere. For first time, I noticed the odour in my room. Jesus, I had to open the window. It dawned on me that I need to change. I can't live like this anymore. As cheesy as this sounds, this marks the new me. If you see some my old post, its a series of depressing post about my insecurities and failures.

29,"It is absolutely absurd how much wealth some people have, while others are literally starving. And 99.9% of people with stupid wealth don't deserve one hundredth of it. Hell, many couldn't SPEND one hundredth without concentrated effort. These people blow more money on one rim of one car than I can spend on myself in a year.

I have never gotten a windfall, most money I have ever had at once was a 1300 dollar tax return, that went straight into bills that had been piling up. And I never will, born into the wrong family.

And while I am struggling to eat, I have a broken down truck I COULD maybe use to make money, except every time I get it back on the road it dies before I can start working. One lousy thousand dollars and I could fix my truck, fill up the tank, stock my cupboards, and be free and clear to actually get ahead. But it won't happen. 

And even the briefest of stints online is an endless barrage of people so well off it makes me feel as 'poor' and 'broke' as society labels me. It's just infuriating having so little food that I actual have to mindful of burning calories, dreaming about the day I can fix the only thing I own (my truck)... while some people time and money to spare to make literal 'eggs woodhouse', driving around in cars worth more than every thing I ever owned, or will own, combined.

And it isn't like I am unwilling to work. I am a VERY hard worker... but I lack a trade, and without my truck I am limited in options. Every time I start to think I am actually getting slightly ahead, truck breaks down, room mate moves out, I lose the job... SOMETHING to forever keep me scrambling just to make ends meet.

Realized the other day, in response to a friend saying he 'has faith I will get back on my feet'... I have never BEEN on my feet. Right from the time I was tossed out at 15, to today twenty years later, I have forever been scrambling to 'get on my feet'. But I never have. Never managed to have any kind of savings, never managed to build any credit, never even managed to stay interested enough in one field to be an expert. And I'll admit, a fair bit of my current problems are self inflicted. Especially my lack of trade, I had opportunities aplenty.

But now? Today? I'd be willing to do about anything honest. But it feels like there are no options for me anymore. And it just pisses me off seeing people thoughtlessly and carelessly wasting money that even a small fraction of could turn my life around.

Got no one to borrow from, too much pride to beg even if it would work, and simply wouldn't steal no matter what. It almost seems my only option is to sell my truck for scrap because even though all that is wrong with it is the starter, I surely can't sell it without being able to show it runs, and without it to find/get me to work I am not gonna be able to repair it either.

Sigh. And it feels so unfair that the amount literally stopping my life from moving forward is such a pittance for many. Feel like someone like me who could be independant with a small hand up should be a priority of social services... but they only want to help people who have NOTHING left, and even then, never enough to actually help them get on their feet.

38,"As I was spending a long time putting branches in a shredder, I felt profoundly okay. That's a level of comfort which I tend to not normally experience. Usually there is always some unpleasant tension.

Then after I was finished I smelled some flowers and simultaneously looked at furniture inside the house. I saw the furniture the same way that I remembered seeing furniture at home in Croatia during my childhood.

Sure, it's the same furniture that I'm familiar with on a daily basis, but this way of experiencing it is amazingly better compared to my usual experience. It is so much better that even drugs cannot be relied upon to bring about such goodness. It's a state of peace, comfort, pleasure in perception of mundane objects, and fulfillment  in the present moment. States like that are so good that upon seeing the difference it's almost like there's no point in being alive for the lesser usual state. It's painful to see the dramatic difference, and to think of the countless times I failed to enjoy things.

After moving to Canada I lost happiness due to bad life circumstances. Because I experienced so much of life in Canada in that state, it seemed like Canada *actually* *was* that way. It's practically impossible to find the boundary between subjective experience and fundamental reality.

Furthermore, because I was in such a state constantly, I forgot about the existence of the better state.

I'm reminded of a long time ago, when I got a new lamp in my room which was similar to the lamp in my room in Croatia. I cried for maybe an hour after that, and I couldn't really understand why. The crying was focused on something about the feelings that lamp reminded me of. I didn't understand back then that those feelings are key aspects of happiness.

I've figured out how to feel good sometimes. First I discovered it with drugs. Then I discovered how to feel good without drugs, via activities which helped tune into a better state. Then I found deeper levels of feeling good which I had forgotten about, and I started seeing certain places in a good way. But, feeling good is still the exception, and not an every day thing. There are various ""islands"" of places and activities in my life which feel good.

There are still levels of feeling good which were common in my childhood, but from which I only catch occasional glimpses like this. I don't even know how to reliably reproduce those moments, or how to make them last longer.

Sometimes just saying I hate Canada moves me toward a better way of perceiving the world around me in the present moment. It seems to destroy a certain habitual pattern which builds up in my mind, and allow me to see the world around me in a more pure and innocent way, without that pattern messing with it. Maybe my parents trained me to be anxious in Canada, and that's the pattern I'm destroying. The pattern itself is certainly worthy of hate.

Someone gave him a big box of free groceries, and while he was grateful at first, when he started going through the box he was like, ""What is this s**t?? 'Chicken and Dumpling' in a can?? That's disgusting!"" and threw away a bunch of things, even slightly expired corn flakes that sure just a little stale. It was still edible, it was just extra crunchy.

I'm not saying that you shouldn't buy skins for your Xbox One controller. But it's ridiculous to be on the phone screaming because it didn't come in TODAY.

As for the food, I know a bunch of homeless shelters that would have gladly taken it. Heck, I even offered to take it. Set it aside and let it be my pile. But he laughed and said, ""No, you don't want that. I won't let you eat garbage"".

I mean, I appreciate him helping me, but I think my situation has opened my eyes to how wasteful some people are.",23May2017,57
41,"So I just recently turned 25 and I do a little writing that brings in some side cash, but I mainly write just when I'm procrastinating. A coworker gave me the idea to make a (kind of) brief list of 25 snippets of scattered wisdom that I've gathered thus far in my 25 years on this planet. So here they are, in no particular order:



1. **""Nobody Cares.""** This two-word quote from Sonny in *A Bronx Tale* is superficial at a first glance, but truly captures the essence of human existence. At the end of the day, people only care about themselves. Do what you have to do to take care of yourself, because, when all is said and done, nobody else will.

2. **Do favors for people.** While many people - as the item number one on this list suggests - will be quick to forget a favor, there are those people who won't forget. It can never hurt to have a favor in the bank with the right person.

3. **Never agree to help someone move.** Perhaps the lone exception to item number two on this list. Unless it's a close family member or one of your closest friends, *never* agree to help someone move. People have a way of making it seem like an easy task when asking, but as someone who took a long time to learn this lesson, it never will be. Always having an excuse ready will save you a miserable day.

4. **Always buy quality tools.** Stealing this one from my old man. Sure, Home Depot, Lowe's, etc. have decent tools at decent prices that are often guaranteed for life. But I promise you this: the day you need the tool the most is the day that you'll have to waste an hour driving to Lowe's to make good on that guarantee. Buy quality tools so you'll only have to buy them once.

5. **Always keep the following in your vehicle: a sweatshirt, a dry pair of warm clothes, a basic set of tools, $250 in cash stashed somewhere safe, *two* phone chargers, a few bottles of water (even on a summer day where they'll be scalding hot, gross water is better than no water if you're in a situation where you need it), and jumper cables.**

6. **Always carry cash on you.** There's nothing more annoying than a guy who doesn't have cash on him in a situation where it's necessary. Even if you tuck only $40 into the back of your wallet, you never know when you'll need it.

7. **Try not to lie.** Situations in which lying may seem the best route present themselves almost every day. But as someone who's better at lying than you, I can assure you that, eventually, you'll find yourself in a hole that a lie can't dig you out of. I'll also add this as a sort of sub-rule to this rule: **If you do lie and you get caught lying, *never* admit to the lie.** Stick to your story no matter how foolish you start to look. Once you admit to being a liar, people won't forget it.

8. **You'll never become truly wealthy without being a little shady.** Hard work only gets you so far. Don't go full-blown criminal, but if a life of true luxury is one of your highest priorities, get involved with the right type of shady people and start putting your money into some shady things. That's about as much as I can elaborate on this rule.

9. **The more selfies a girl posts, the more selfish she is.** If you start talking to a girl and her Instagram/Facebook posts are mostly selfies, she can't be trusted. Sure, every girl is going to post selfies, but the more there are, the more self-absorbed she is, and the less she can be trusted. She craves attention and will entertain anyone who gives it to her.

10. **My father is always right.** Even I'm not yet mature enough to fully abide by this rule, but the older I get the more clear it becomes. I've never gotten bad advice from my father.

11. **A friend who cheats on his significant other shouldn't be trusted.** I was far from the poster boy for relationship values in my college years, so this dances on the line of hypocrisy coming from me. Nevertheless, if you have a friend who regularly cheats on his girlfriend/wife, be careful around him. He's a dishonest person whose lies and deception aren't exclusive to his significant other. This doesn't apply to that one buddy who's always got a different girl on his arm; I'm talking about a guy who's in a long-term relationship and regularly strays from it.

12. **Get your hair cut on a regular schedule.** Keeping a regular haircut schedule will help keep the rest of your life ""neat and trimmed"". Show me a guy who goes 3 or 4 months without getting a haircut (unless he's deliberately growing his hair out) and I'll show you a guy who doesn't have his shit together.

13. **Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today.** Again stealing from my old man, and again a rule I don't yet abide by fully. If you can do something today, do it today. Don't wait until tomorrow, or next weekend, or next month. You'll be amazed at the free time you gain by practicing this.

14. **Avoid financing purchases whenever possible.** There's always tempting offers being presented on commercials advertising all types of products for low-interest financing, zero-interest financing, no interest for six months, etc. But if you have the cash to pay for something now, pay for it now. The odds are that if you don't have the cash to buy it now, you shouldn't be buying it at all. This of course doesn't apply to high-price necessities like cars, homes, etc. 

15. **Don't report all of your income if you're in a position where you're able not to.** Of course if you work a job where you get your weekly paycheck every week and have no other sources of income, you don't have a choice. But, if you're someone who deals in cash or someone who has one or several additional income streams, keep that shit on the down-low. What Uncle Sam don't know won't hurt him.

16. **The less people know about you and what you're doing, the better off you are.** Simple. Don't blab to everyone about what you're doing with your life. People love to talk and word spreads quickly.

17. **Don't ""take time off"" from your higher education.** I made this mistake when I was 18. I figured that taking a year off after my first year of college would help me figure things out. It didn't. I wasted a year cutting down trees to pay bills. Finish while you're there. Take the year off *after* you graduate. Spoiler Alert: after you graduate, you won't even want to take the year off.

18. **Don't berate the people who handle your food.** If you order regularly from a pizza place or a Chinese restaurant, etc. and they take a long time to deliver it one night, or they miss an item on your order, *Let. It. Go.* Don't call them and flip out. 

19. **Deposit 10% of your income into some type of a retirement plan/investment portfolio as soon as you start making money.** Another piece of wisdom from my father. If you find that you're unable to afford to do this, odds are that you need to sit down and figure out a better budget for your money. 10% is nothing in the now. It's $100 for every $1000 you make. Over the course of 40 years placed in something with decent growth, your 60-year-old self will be thanking you.

20. **If your dog doesn't like someone, or if someone doesn't like your dog, odds are that that person is fucked up.** What sick weirdo doesn't like a dog? Pretty self-explanatory.

21. **Make eye contact.** Look people in the eye when you talk to them. Whether you're interviewing for a job, flirting with a girl, getting chewed out by your boss, whatever. Eye contact exudes confidence. 

22. **People who constantly complain about problems with other people are generally the cause of those problems.** You know the type. The guy who's always getting in arguments, the girl who's always complaining about guys, etc. Anyone who has that many issues with that many people is, by basic logic, a problem him/herself.

23. **Don't get ""wasted"".** Again, borderline hypocritical coming from me, but that doesn't make it any less true. Go out, have a few beers, get a nice toasty buzz, but keep your faculties. Especially as you get older. The older you get, the heavier the consequences of bad decisions become.

24. **A girl's relationship with her mother tells you all you need to know about that girl.** A girl who fights with her mother constantly, who complains about what a ""bitch"" her mother is, etc. is a girl that you want to stay away from. I'm not saying bad mothers don't exist. And I'm not saying that a girl is wrong for disliking her mother. The point here is that if you become involved with a girl who has a poor relationship with her mother, you'll eventually find yourself thrown into the wake of that relationship dynamic. Steer clear.

25. **Don't let people see you miserable.** Try to present a happy persona at all times. People are drawn to jovial people. Even when you're miserable and want to punch everyone who looks at you in the face, paste that smile on and act. ",23May2017,5
