3,"Kind of a clickbaity title, but I was reading some ancient post and a person mentioned how many times he's felt like he ""had it all figured out"" only to learn otherwise. I see a lot of people to refer to this kind of mentality (as much as I like you r/iamverysmart, you're infuriatingly guilty of this) as a normal thing, just a ""cringey"" part of youthful awkwardness everyone goes through and matures out of. I never experienced it though - not in any meaningful way. If anything, I've had much more notable experiences of feeling incredibly, hopelessly behind - as in, ""Holy shit this 14-year-old understands the meaning of life and here I am dithering around caring about things at 20!"" If anything, the internet has taught me to be a little less gullible about this stuff. I have a long history of taking people's pretensions at face value; especially if it's online. On one hand, yeah, people lie, but the internet's also a great place to be brutally honest about socially inappropriate things, like how much better you are than everyone else. It never before - and often doesn't - occur to me that the person writing about how isolated their genius makes them, how frustrating it is that everyone's so stupid and shallow and no one's on *their* level, might be exaggerating or even lying, rather than legit venting. Obviously they must be geniuses! I'm surrounded by geniuses, how am I supposed to compete - what do you mean they're bullshitting?

All of the above applies to thathappened-style stories. I can think of a number of posts I've probably read in the past three years that would be great on mockery subs like taht: the person who is loathed in numerous professional circles because she's so much more knowledgeable than the actual experts their egos can't handle it; the guy who made the interviewer at his job question her existence because of his antiestablishment response to a question; the person no one wants to take their ideas to because they know he'll rip them to shreds and always be right, the 30-something lamenting the burden of always being the smartest person in the room...my gut instinct is to be scared shitless of people like this, now I think they've been defanged in my mind with the possibility that maybe they're not as godlike as I fear.

I have no damn confidence. It never would occur to me that I have everything truly figured out - or that I'm in any place to tell anyone about it. I tend to feel more like I'm fucking guessing, getting lucky, and constantly learning shit from other people instead of figuring it out for myself (probably a big part of it. It's impossible to superciliously feel like you're the only person who ""gets it"" when you learned about whatever concept from someone else, possibly someone younger than you).",05Aug2017,1

8,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub but I couldn't think of an appropriate one. The purpose of this post is to see if I need to go to see professional help or if I've just been spending too much time talking to Dr. Google. 

For the past 3 weeks I've had a chronic headache which has gotten better and worse but has never left. At my worst I couldn't open my eyes or look at light and at my best I have a dull ache (4-5/10 pain) through my whole head. 

I've also had small instances of heart palpitations and dizziness which I know are signs of CO poisoning. 

I've also had a general sick feeling and had a few days last week of nausea. 

No one else in my house is affected but through the walls in my (isolated) room you can hear something wrong with a heating duct which brings up questions on ventilation, etc. 

I've been in hospital since this has all started and blood tests have been done to check for viruses but would they have checked for something related to CO? Since I've already been to hospital I don't want to waste time on this if I'm just overreacting. 

Thanks in advance ",05Aug2017,1
9,"NOTE: This dream has some disturbing stuff in it. If talking about people getting their veins ripped out would make you uncomfortable then don't continue.

So it began with me at a park. I meet a girl and we talk a little bit and I give her my Grandpa's address for some reason. As she leaves one of her fingers falls off.

Then, I'm at my grandpa's house and for some reason all of my family except from his side up is there. 

For some reason my mom is a shrimp (Which is a recurring aspect of my dreams). She is in my grandpa's bedroom in between the pages of a book called ""The Lizard Who Fell From Hell."" 

Everyone is talking and stuff and then a group of people arrive. They look human but unnatural sort of. They all sit down and then they get less and less human looking as time goes by. One of them is a goth chick who looks like she's been stitched together with different people's body parts, one of them being the girl from the park's finger. Another one is a lizard person. A bunch of them are super skinny and a few are super fat. My grandpa says they are from his side of the family and that, since he never had a son, me and my siblings aren't like them.

Then things suddenly went to shit and they all attacked us. The goth chick started sawing off people's arms and the skinny people (that other people were calling Wendigos) started eating people. The lizard guy pinched my arm then tore out one of my veins and slurped it like a spaghetti noodle. Then my grandpa's arm got 5x bigger and he said ""Hahaha! The claw!"" and then fucking tore out my spine (It grew back a moment later).

 At one point one of the fat people came up to me and I asked if they were going to eat me and they said ""No, I'm here for the repository!"" and then one of the walls vanished and instead there was a conveyor belt leading to a place with tons more of the wendigos. He laid down on the conveyor and as he went by more and more of the fat ones jumped on and the skinny ones tore them apart and ate them and the whole time the fat ones were giggling.

Later my cousin said ""GET YOUR MOM! SHE KNOWS KARATE!"" so I ran in the room to open the copy of *The Lizard Who Fell From Hell* that she was hiding in. When the lizard dude saw it he said ""Hey man! You know that book is about me, right?"" Just a second after I let my mom, a flying shrimp who apparently knows karate, out of the book the roof turned into the ocean and a boat sailed by and grabbed her and went off.

Later me and my cousin were the only non-monsters alive and we ran to the car and we drove away. The whole time I was driving she was yelling at me and saying it was all my fault.

Then I woke up and cried a little bit. If you want to interpret that go for it my dudes",05Aug2017,1
10,"My friend invited me to go to the gym with him. He invited his girlfriend too. I am also friends with her, I met her in my English class – met them separately, but I’ve known each for about a year.)


I asked them whether or not she was gonna be working in with us, they both more or less said no, and that she was going off to do her own thing. I then flippantly said, “Good, know your place.”
My and friend and I both laugh, cause obviously (only to us, apparently) I was only kidding. I was expecting pushback for banter, which is expected – but not this. First, she gets upset at her boyfriend for, “Not standing up for her.” I then turn to her, to let her know I was just joking – Before I can even finish my sentence she says, “No” and walks away (rude).


I was pretty surprised by this, because I know this girl, it wasn’t some random person. However, I understand you can’t dictate and control how people react. I consider myself a pretty emotionally intelligent person (Ironic, I know.) so I immediately recognized the Catch 22 I was in. 
A.	I could do what I would normally do in this situation, not care at all. Personally, I don’t think what I did was that bad – but I’m invested in these people, they’re fun to hang out with, and I don’t have a lot of friends I can unwind with. I also realized if I treated her bad, I’d be disrespecting her, and my friend would HAVE to say/do something, or he’d look bad if he didn’t.


So I went with option B.  The weak, timid, (I hate this word, but it sums up my attitude) beta approach.
Even though my friend said to ignore her, and that she’d get over it; I apologized, tried joking, at times avoided eye contact. I knew she could tell what I was doing; and even though she tried acting like she wasn’t, I could tell she was still annoyed with me.


In fact, I’m annoyed with me. I hate that I felt like I had to act like that (and did). But I can’t change the past. So the question is, how should I proceed with my encounters with her? Being vindictive and passive aggressive is petty and weak, nor am I going to overtly ignore her. 


I guess I should just let it go. I don’t know. What do you guys think – do you guys think I was wrong here? Interested in your responses.


TL;DR: Went with my friend to the gym, his girlfriend came along. Asked them if she would be working out with us, she says no. I say,(Jokingly)  “Good, know your place Samantha.” Friend and I laugh. She does not laugh.

16,"I believe that the death penalty, the system of capital punishment in the United States, on both the federal and state level, should be either discontinued or reworked. The three chief reasons I believe this are, firstly, that it does not act as an effective deterrent of crime, that it is much more expensive than the alternatives, and that the prices it creates in terms of the innocents it kills is far too high.

Firstly though, before I get into the crux of my argument, I want to state an exception to my stance on this issue: one use of the death penalty is as a method of “getting revenge”, wherein we as a group of people can enjoy the sort of catharsis that comes from knowing that a truly evil person has been killed (and can no longer hurt anyone else). I am not totally against this, and I can understand this aspect of the death penalty. I personally am okay with the death penalty in situations like this, as long as the person to be executed has committed a particularly abhorrent crime, is fully lucid, and has admitted to their guilt of their own volition (as anyone who hits those criteria helps eliminate some of my issues with the death penalty, primarily the execution of innocents).  This exception is one of the reasons I wrote that it “should be discontinued or reworked” - I believe that capital punishment has many flaws inherent to it, but there definitely do exist reasons for it, some of which I can agree with.

So, let's get into the crux of why this is my view on the issue. First and foremost, I believe that the duty of the government (specifically, both the state and federal governments in the USA) is to help as much as possible, and to hurt as little as possible. More specifically, the government (any government) should do things that bring as much good into the world as possible, while also minimizing as much suffering as possible. My issue with the death penalty is that I believe that it actively acts against that goal - that although it can serve a strong purpose in “minimizing suffering”, insofar as it takes evil people out of the world, it can also introduce an amount of suffering into this world that may ultimately exceed the suffering taken out. At the end of the day, though, I believe that the death penalty could be reworked to minimize the occurrences of the infliction of suffering, and maximize the occurrences of the removal of suffering. There are lots of ways this could be done, and many people would prefer that the government go about those things in different ways - this discussion though will revolve around how this idea relates to the death penalty.

So that is some of the general stuff that lies the groundwork for my view on this issue - I want to detail now some of the specific ways the death penalty fails (and these are the reasons due to which I believe capital punishment should be reworked). Firstly, I believe that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent to crime. It is important to clarify here that I am not saying that the death penalty is not at all a deterrent to crime; I am simply stating that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent to crime, especially given the fact that in order for it to be a deterrent at all you have to kill (bad) people. I have done some research I will reference now (and again in the future), you can see the sources, fully cited, at the end! 

So, as I was doing research in order to see if I was correct on this idea, and I found the papers of Lamperti and Pepper, titled “Does Capital Punishment Deter Murder?” and “Deterrence and the Death Penalty” respectively. These papers focus on the gathering/interpretation of mostly statistical data to determine the efficacy of capital punishment as a deterrent to homicide. Lamperti concludes, in a quote from Supreme Court Justice Blackmun, that “capital punishment serves no useful purpose that can be demonstrated” including that purpose of deterrence (10). Pepper & co. speak in their paper of multiple examples wherein the death penalty was not shown to deter crime: one example is that of Texas’s, about which Pepper & co. write that “there is no apparent relationship between the homicide rate and the frequency of execution” (39) in the state of Texas from the years 1974-2009. The ultimate conclusion of their paper, however, is that “inferences about the effect of alternative capital punishment regimes cannot be reduced to purely statistical questions” (43).

So, given that we cannot prove that it is not functioning as a deterrent to crime, we can also not prove that it is. We do, though, have access to small studies that show that in many places it did not affect crime rates. At the end of the day though, given the costs involved (in terms of money & lives), as well as the fact that this system does not clearly and obviously act as a deterrent to crime (mostly because we simply cannot know if it is), I believe that this opens up the system to critique and a potential reworking.

My second issue with the death penalty, after the idea that it is not a clear and effective deterrent of crime, is due to how it is actually more expensive to execute someone than to keep them imprisoned for life. I have conducted a good amount of research on this as well, in order to flesh out my initial viewpoint. Spangenberg, Kasten, and McFarland are the authors and/or editors of “Capital Punishment or Life Imprisonment – Some Cost Considerations”, “An Economic Analysis of the Death Penalty”, and “The Death Penalty vs. Life Incarceration: A Financial Analysis” respectively. Spangenberg writes that “it is not more economical, necessarily, to execute a criminal that to keep him in confinement for life” (45). Kasten writes that capital punishment is usually more expensive, with costs “estimated to range in the millions of dollars” (11), but he ultimately concludes that “economic efficiency cannot be accurately assessed given the present shortage of quantitative data on the marginal benefits and marginal costs of the death penalty” (15). McFarland writes that “the death penalty has grown to be much more expensive than life imprisonment, whether with or without parole” with the cost coming from “expensive living conditions, a much more extensive legal process, and increasing resistance to the death penalty from chemical manufacturers overseas” (46).

The point of throwing this handful of sources at you all is to provide a backing to the general idea that the death penalty is actually rather more expensive than simply imprisoning a prisoner for life. The chief reason for this cost disparity is the intensity of the legal process related to strongly-enough confirming the guilt of someone that the state intends to execute - it is a lengthy and expensive legal process involving many checks and balances (and I expand on this a bit more in the next paragraph). The reality of this issue though is that the costs could be reduced by simplifying and/or expediting the legal process - but then you increase the rates of execution of the wrongly convicted (which is absolutely my largest issue with the death penalty).

So, to speak to that, following a pattern you’ve probably discerned by now, I conducted some research on the relationship between wrongful conviction and capital punishment. I was asking Google about this, and Google answered me via Carter and Radelet in their articles “Parallels Between Innocence of a Crime and Innocence of the Death Penalty” and “The Execution of the Innocent”. Carter argues that innocence regarding capital crimes is a complex issue, and talks of the legal processes involved as well as examples of such processes. She ultimately does not take a side in the issue, stating that “legal issues in capital cases are highly complicated, whether at the pretrial stage, the dual trial stages, or the mandatory appeals...” (461) - this is, of course, extremely relevant to my last point. The trial is complicated to minimize the chances of a mis-conviction, but due to this the cost is inflated. Radelet (and Bedau) felt much more strongly on the issue, coming out strongly against the death penalty, citing reasons of innocence amongst some of those executed, as well as “innocent victims in the death row inmate’s family” (112) amongst other reasons. They ultimately wonder “how future generations, when they look back, will evaluate America’s current love for the executioner” (124). The specific reasons they give can be seen in their paper/figures, but the crux of the issue for me is the death penalty is not necessary at all, and the fact that it kills even one innocent person is disgusting and a failure of the justice system. Especially because, if someone has been wrongly imprisoned, they can have a life afterwards. Those who have been executed wrongfully are just dead. And for those people that have to live on, knowing their loved one was wrongfully killed by a system that not only is not effective deterrent of crime but also more expensive than the alternative (wherein their loved one gets their life back), it can make the whole system seem nonsensical.

So, to summarize, I believe that although the death penalty absolutely serves a number of purposes, the inherent costs to the system suggest that the best course of action is a reworking of the system in any way that minimizes those costs.

From an outside perspective, it might seem like I have a cool life. I live in an exotic city with a rad apartment. I travel all of the time. I'm hooking up with/in the early stages of dating a very foxy girl (who I haven't told that I'm depressed yet, I suspect that it's too early for that or maybe I'm just afraid it'll scare her off)

23,"someone posted on askreddit about something that has ruined your life.

I wouldn't necessarily say the series of event have ruined my life but they have affected me as a person

small background: my family was doing some....thing illegal (never found out) and I was placed into fostercare from 5 years old until I was 18. I was taken in to family when I was about 6 and they made it sound like i had a new family, I didn't quite understand but I went with it, I just wanted a family and to be loved instead of that weird pseudo-orphanage place. Turns out I was just some kid that was taken into custody.

Tl;dr : I thought I had a family, foster parent made it clear I didn't. Got depressed and it led to bad decisions that affected my future. Also never learned how to have healthy social relationships.

Now I wasn't a great kid but I was never trouble. I generally stayed to myself helped when asked. I would moan and groan but I would still get done what I was asked too. 
A/B student from elementary to high school junior year. 

She on the other hand was focused primarily on her work ( she ran an at home daycare) and her family. Don't get me wrong it wasn't a bad place- nice quiet suberb, house was generally pretty clean, and I had what I needed. Other than that our interactions were basically only at dinner or when she needed me to do something. 
Fix this, fix that, show someone this, clean that, etc. 

Didn't teach me anything growing up, everything I learned was through school, my own research or my foster services. 

Also she showed that her family was her priority above everything else. They were gone for 4 days one time didn't hear from them, apparently they went to Disneyland without me ( I was 17 at the time and I was used to it so I never said anything to case worker). I was usually not considered to go out with the ""family"" for outings, I could even sometimes hear them talking about the plans without even mentioning me. She didn't care about my feelings as long as she made the point she was in charge. Would constantly get called faggot, or told the reason someone else got something nice like an xbox or even just nicer clothes was because ""they are my [her]  family."" I also basically wasn't allowed out my room while the daycare children were there ( which was fine since I didn't want to be out there anyways). 

Come Senior year of HS, I had saved up money for one of those crappy net books for school to do my homework and occasionally IM since I couldn't always afford to have a working cell at the time. One day the internet was out and i spent about 5 hours after school trying to get it to work since I had a couple unfinished papers due and a midterm the next day( keep in mind this was about 9 years ago when basically everything fucked up your internet connection). She let every 5-10year old use the PC that was directly connected to modem and wireless router and it was riddled with viruses, barely worked and on top of that she barely remembered any of the passwords that they were constantly changing ( let alone dealing with the service provider). Opening any sort of software or repairs felt like the PC would burst into flames. Finally at about 9pm I got everything up and running but I still had time to get things at least started and maybe finish before the classes started later the next day. So I go to my room, close my door and start working since everyone else is already going to bed and I didn't wanna keep anyone up by working in the living room where the main PC is. Come 10pm shes knocking on my door telling me that I have to go to bed. I told her I can't I have homework that I had to get finished. She told me that it wasn't her fault and that I should have started it earlier and I have to listen to her rules. My rebellious self told her "" No, because all this work is worth most of my grade for my classes"" ( which they were, they were projects/essays that just needed a few pages that needed to be finished, would have taken maybe 2-3 hours at most). She didn't say anything and left. A few minutes later my internet connection cuts out while researching for one of my essays. At this point I'm saying to my self ""What could possibly be wrong now?"". Go to check the wireless router, there she is unplugging everything I spent all day working on FOR MY EDUCATION, for my grades, and for my sanity just because she wanted to be in charge. I didn't say a thing. I went to school the next day, failed 3 classes ( well D but that doesn't look good on a transcript) and just gave up from there. Social Worker saw the sudden drop in my grades and asked what was up, I told her "" Ask my guardian"". She just said she didn't know, with no excuse. No follow up from my social worker. Failed the next semester because I was too depressed ( and a teenager lol) to do any of my work. Why was I doing it? Who was I doing for? If it was for my ""parent"" she obviously didn't care and neither did my social worker. I was doing it because I thought they cared but when it  became clear that they didnt' why should I continue. I could be doing it for myself but at that point I felt so lost that I didn't really care about myself at all. Despite all the ""I love you"" and stuff like that she said, I realized she never meant it, she just said it to say it. From there it was kinda just me building emotional barriers, not letting people in and doing my best to just get by without killing myself. I had almost no friends because the agency required fingerprint from their parents for me to do anything outside the home I lived at. Birthday party? It would take more work than its worth. Couldn't learn to drive because nobody in the family wanted to teach me and the agency wouldn't allow me to go a driving school. Couldn't have a boyfriend/girlfriend again because of the fingerprinting nonsense. Having a cell that I paid for on my own was nice though because they couldn't say anything about it since I paid for it myself, but it wasn't always in service. I had video games as a hobby which was nice because I could enjoy it on my own assuming I could save up the money to buy a console and a game as long as it wasn't M rated ( which was fair). 

By the time I was 18, I was a shut in who only played video games going from a A/B student to a D/F student with no social skills, emotionally detached, and scared to form any kind of relationship. 

The last two things that happened was once I turned 18 I was told once the school year was over I would have to start paying rent. I was like Okay, I have 3 months to find a job. Come June she suddenly says I owe her 1500$ of backrent because she ""changed her mind."" I had the money due to a savings that I had been building up since I was 13 years old through my foster agency  but that was supposed to be for school, buying a car, and you know... a home. At that time that was about 80% of my funds, and my social worker just went along with it. Hated it but I got through it and continued to live there for another year while I tried to save up money. Unfortunately I couldn't work full time and go to school like I originally wanted. Financial Aid I wasn't able to qualify for because of my grade, my fault on that one ( I think...). Tried to do both but failed horribly so I had to just take the job and try to survive. Anyways I had to stop living there because long story short she lost the house because she wasn't able to keep up with payments, seeing how she was always buying stuff like xboxs, flat screen tv's, and new cars for ""her"" family I wasn't surprised. So they were all gonna move to a home with her daugher, without me because there wasn't enough room. Conviently her son who couldn't hold a job and needed a place to stay was given a place in the new home, but I wasn't surprised like she said so many times before, he was ""her""family. 

For those of you who actually read my backstory, I know it's not as bad as I make it sound and there are definitely worse things out there but I needed to vent. I'm still working on a lot of personal things and overall I know I can't blame everything on her but I still feel like this affected me more than i would like to admit and it's also something I've been wanting to get off my chest. 

Or I'm just being dumb and over analyzing my life and shifting blame lol

I was sitting up late with her the other night, she said she was going to bed so I told her to throw me the remote. She did and I said ""I think imma watch shameless again"" 

Then the way she moved I thought she'd thought about sitting with me for the first episode, but she fucking didn't. She made this crazy noise and then fell on the ground. Like she didn't put the arms up to soften the blow or do anything besides check out completely for a second. 

Her dog was barking and snarling at me, so I threw him in a room, and I was screaming ""mom mom mom, can you hear me?"" The entire time.

Finally I pulled her upright and she opened her eyes. She told me to stop shaking, cause she couldn't tell if it was me or her shaking. 

She refused to go to the hospital.

25,"A life feels, for lack of a better word, larger than life. Life isn't just electrical impulses and pumping blood - it's unique experiences. We can record our experiences, but the vast majority of our memories will one day be wiped out permanently. Our childhoods, our first kisses, they're now just faded recollections doomed to complete obscurity. 

There isn't an answer to life. The formation of life is simply prerequisite on a series of coincidences - in the vastness of the universe, it's an eventuality. The entire history of humanity is doomed to one day be lost along with the heat death of planet Earth. 

Human history is fed to us through textbooks and lectures, but imagine how easily we could have actually been born in a different era? A millennium isn't even a tick of the second hand on the cosmic clock. It feels almost unfair how millions of people lived out their entire lives without the technologies we have today. It makes you wonder what life will be like 500 years from now, and whether it will have improved or worsened. 

The universe is so incomprehensibly vast that it would be foolish to doubt the existence of extraterrestrial life. If that life is intelligent life, they're likely destined to the same ultimate fate. 

We only live for 80 years. In the grand scheme of things, that's insultingly short. When we die, our ability to perceive reality will return to that of before we were born. It seems so pointless to waste our lives on the bullshit we waste our lives on.

26,"""Sir, The articles by Clare Foges (""Gender-fluid world is muddling young minds"", July 27) and Hugo Rifkind (""Social media is making gender meaningless"", Aug 1), and the letters about children wanting to be pandas (July 29), dogs or mermaids (Aug 1), show that the confusion about gender identity is a modern and now internet-fuelled, form of the ancient philosophy of Gnosticism. 

""The Gnostic, one who ""knows"", has discovered the secret of ""who I really am"", behind the deceptive outward appearance (in Rifkind's apt phrase, the ""ungainly, boring, fleshly one""). 

""This involves denying the goodness, or even the ultimate reality, of the natural world. Nature, however, tends to strike back, with the likely victims in this case being vulnerable and impressionable youngsters who, as confused adults, will pay the price for their elders' fashionable fantasies.""

I know it is a ridiculous thought, based on nothing but my own insecurity. Still though, I feel a bit down. This tends to happen to me. I feel great, until some small event triggers this paranoid thinking. Afterwords (now) I just want to shut myself in to be sad. Is this normal?

Her father is an abusive fuck. Her mother has been dead for 10 years.

She got this beautiful mixed pug yorkshire puppy two years ago when we still were in a relationship. I met the pup, I slept with the pup. I slept with her and the pup. I fed the pup. I played with the pup.

She died yesterday to complication of a castration surgery. Mother fucker why.

I am so fucking sad. I'm crying. I'm crying for the pup. I'm crying for my ex. I'm crying for me.

This is the first sad thing I've ever felt in my life.

Nothing has ever been this sad.

33,"It's kind of pathetic really, when we broke up nearly 5 years ago and we were only together for 4 years. She got married and had a kid within a year of us breaking up. She was my best friend, the only person I could ever see being with for any sort of extended time. 

But I was a dick and never had my bi polar under control. 

I insisted I didn't need help when I did. 

I pushed her away when I needed her most. 

I was selfish pursuing my own dreams and never asked her what hers were. 

I have to live with this for the rest of my life. 


I've dreamt of her a lot lately. It always feels so real. 

I can feel her.

I can hear her laugh. 

I can touch her. 

I can smell her. 

Then I wake up. 

I've only had one girlfriend since, and it was really just a half-assed attempt to replace her. She reminded me so much of her. 

But she was a different. 

She looked like her. 

But in a different way. 

She laughed like her. 

But at different things. 

She was loving. 

But never the way that my ex was loving. 


How do I cope with the fact my best days are behind me? I'll probably never find what I had with her. How often do you date your best friend? Someone you want to spend every waking moment with. Someone who understands what you've come from and how far you came from there? 


I struggled a lot growing up. I know misery is not a scorecard, but I feel like I'd be in the top scorers. She'd never judge the things that I did, even when we were kids growing up. She understood why it was hard for me to eat and why I'd wake up in the middle of the night crying. 


How can I ever explain these things to somebody new?

How will they ever understand?


I guess I'm really just venting because I woke up crying because of a dream of her. But I really want anybody that reads this to just understand that you really don't understand what you have until it's gone. 

If you need help get help.

If somebody else wants to help you, let them.

It's impossible to find somebody that will give you what you already have. 


Tldr: Instead of deleting Facebook, hitting the gym and lawyering up after shit hits the fan.. 

Maybe you should delete Facebook and focus on the ones you love.

34,"Yesterday I went to a music festival. I went there alone. I didn't have to work during the weekend and the weather was nice. So I decided to take a 300 km drive and go to a music festival. Alone. 

I knew there would be some people who I knew there. I was hoping that no one would notice me, say hello. Sadly, a couple of them still did. Fortunately they only said hello. No small talk. But still, when they came to say hello to me I thought, ""Why? Why are you doing this? You don't have to do this. Just move along. Please!""

I saw my ex there as well. I broke up with her about two years ago. It was a long distance relationship and I couldn't deal with the regular goodbyes and Skype calls anymore. Also I realised that I was a manipulative and pretentious asshole and she deserved better than that, but that's a whole 'nother thing.

Anyway, I saw her there. At the music festival last night. She didn't saw me, I think. She came and stood like 2-3 meters in front of me. That very moment a song about everyone having a special someone started playing. Life is funny like that some times. Especially since she was there with a guy. They were holding hands and cuddling. I didn't know the guy. I tried to ignore them, but I couldn't. So I left. 

I don't whether I still have feelings for her. I'd like to think I don't. In fact I don't know if I've ever been in love. Or felt something special towards someone. I've kind of liked some people. But when I see myself with them... Well, it kind of ruins the whole picture for me. Quite frankly it makes me sick. Having sex is a good example for it. It just doesn't work. Me being there is a turn off itself. 

I don't know if I have anything to say with all that nonsense really. Since I try not to talk or connect with people anymore I think I just want to rant somewhere. Get some things off my mind. Reddit seems like a good place for it. I don't think no-one I know follows me here. Although I wish I could not know people.

I'm not looking for life changing advice, financial advice (I can manage but you can't predict the unpredictable), or pity, just maybe something to help me get through this.

Saturday: Grandpa in hospital, very ugly end to a long and serious relationship that almost ended with my ex killing themselves or moving across the country

Monday: Grandpa passes away, beginning of 4 day abdominal cramping and bloating session

Tuesday: Car has major issues which could cost me my job, first retainer (bottom teeth) breaks (-275$), first payment for fall semester due (-600$, not including help from parents just personal payments)

Wednesday: Ex calls again and I end up having to talk them down (this is the first time, it happens two more times this week) second retainer (top teeth) broke (-300$), car breaks down at work first time

Thursday: Parents find weed and bowl and go on hour long rant about how my life is going down the gutter ONLY because of pot and atheism (good student, good moral, Eagle Scout, not an ass) (-80$), car breaks down second time 

Friday: Parents find another small baggy of weed (hell, I need that shit for the week I've had) (-30$), managers threaten my job if car cannot be maintained or replaced

All throughout this I have no friends to talk to because they've all gone off leading lives of drug addicts and crime (I'm young but these people are crazy), I can't talk to them about my relationship because I'm closeted w/ rumors surrounding my relationship, and the only person I have to comfort me just wants in my pants. My parents are the last people to go to because they have always been judgmental and quick to point a finger even when it is nobodies fault.

47,"10 months ago I decided to move. Id been unhappy where I was for several reasons, mainly that everything there reminded me of bad times. I used to be addicted to heroin and even though it's been years since then, I could never shake the reputation or stigma attached to my past decisions. So one day I decided to leave, packed my things, and 4 days later I was in another state. 

Where I used to live I never had an issue getting a job. I loved how companies would basically fight over me, and not once did anyone question my salary requirements. I worked great jobs that paid well and offered amazing opportunities. And then I moved here, where the same kind of job told me I was severely under-qualified, but grocery stores wouldn't hire me to stock shelves either because I was overqualified. For 10 months Ive felt like there was something wrong with me that put me in a position where I was simply not hirable.

Today I went to yet another job interview. It's not a fantastic job, and it's not going to further my career plans in any way, but it will pay my bills. I'll be able to save up, and move out of the house I'm unhappy living in. I won't need roommates to make my rent cheaper. I'll be able to afford to go out, which I haven't done even once since moving here. 

I'm so happy that this small pizza place recognized my desperation and decided to take a chance on me even though Ive never worked in food service at all, and have no experience with a cash register.

And while I did so, I discovered that if I struck the bottom end of it just right on the concrete, it would light up bright white as if it was glowing hot.

I had a dream last night that I was supposed to get on a train, but I missed it by only a few seconds. Thankfully, it broke down and had to be pulled back to the station by four horses - three white and one light brown. And I tried to joke with the passengers about how it was almost like that scene from Princess Bride with the four white horses. I even did my best Andre the Giant imitation and everything. But everyone kept fixating on the fact that one of the horses was brown and therefore it was completely different.

I had a dream last night that I needed photographs of myself taken to send to my mother, and a friend of mine and two random people that she was hanging out with offered to take them. But throughout the photo-shoot, I kept discovering that I was wearing different clothes than the ones I had carefully picked out. And then when it was over, it turned out that one of the guys that was taking the photographs had already done all of the post-processing and put them together into a little book, and I had to try to pretend that I was pleased with this in order to not hurt his feelings even though I really wanted to do all of that part myself, and some of the effects that he had chosen to use were honestly just plain awful.

I had a dream last night that my brother and I were part of a clan of anthropomorphic weasels, but that our colony was in the process of collapsing, and while running desperately from some unspeakable horror we came across a walled city, the gates of which looked like the gates of heaven - only grey instead of white. It turned out that the city was home to a colony of anthropomorphic wolves who were willing to welcome us in, but we had to adhere to their list of laws, called ""The Thirteen Commandments"" - all of which were strange and nonsensical, but apparently somehow held their society together and made it strong. My brother got in trouble for breaking the thirteenth commandment (""Thou shalt not attempt to punch something, but miss"") and we ended up on the run yet again.",05Aug2017,1

57,"Hello there /r/self folks, I have something to share that I'm not proud of and a problem I don't know how to deal with.

I will need to buy (pet) cattle in the future for complicated reasons, and decided that instead of getting them from a breeder, I'll be picking one or two spent dairy cows who are supposed to be sent to slaughter. I've spent time with the herd of a local farm for a month, and being familiar with the cows, I've already chosen two of them who like me.

Recently, another big white cow decided to tag along. She's very affectionate (more than the two I've chosen), but she's also very deformed and most likely going to be sent to an abattoir soon because of that. And because of that I ignored her while playing with the others. When I'm feeding others treats, I don't give her any. I avoid looking at her when she's trying to get my attention. I don't want to get attached to her knowing she's going to be killed soon, and I feel awful about pushing her away while she's seeking signs of affection.

I don't know how to handle the situation. I don't have anything prepared for them yet and I'm in a temporary difficult financial situation (my original two have years to live before their slaughter get scheduled, which was more than enough for preparation, but now I'm caught by surprise with this new girl that has only months), and I dread having to pick only two out of the three because I don't have enough money.

Part of me tells me to let the big white girl go, as my chances to save her are much slimmer than with the others. But it's unfair to her, she deserves a second life, especially considering how much hit the fan with her first one and that the only thing she wants is affection. I need to hear people on this please, what I should do, maybe someone will (miraculously) find a way to delay her slaughter and give me more time to work with, but by myself, I'm lost on this one.

[They look like little lightbulb](http://www.cupwise.com/fx/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/tube-fm3.png) and are the main elements in old audio devices.

The problem is, you can't walk into your favorite electronic shop and order the tube you want these days: you need to go online and they're quite pricey (12-15€ on average) so you either bite the bullet, trade yours with other collectors or make something up, which is not always easy.

65,"Last January I went to MEPS in Knoxville to join the Army. It's a two-day process where you take some tests, do a physical, fill out loads of paperwork, etc. I was doing it so I could go to college for free once I got out and I thought I had no other choice to make it.

Before I even got there I knew I wasn't going to join. My recruiter couldn't secure the MOS I wanted and forced something on me I had no idea about or didn't want. Before I got too far I implied that I was doing drugs so I shouldn't go do the physical and be denied forever (I wasn't actually doing drugs, just wanted to get out early.)

Well, the people working there implied in return that I was making the biggest mistake of my life, just adding more to the feeling that I was pretty screwed. After getting chewed out I had to sit in the designated 'game room' for about 6 hours waiting for the van that had taken me there to come pick me up. While everyone else was making something of their lives and getting jobs, I was watching Seinfeld season 10 and playing XBox on a CRT tv.

A man I had ridden in with was also kicked out early because he needed to provide documentation for a car crash he had a long time ago. He was sitting on a couch in the waiting room looking sullen, as I could see through the glass. I don't normally go out of my way to talk to people, but he was looking just as sad as I was so I went over there.

We spoke for about 2 hours and I'll never forget it. There's no way to explain it truly. I hated my high school, I hated my potential future, everything just seemed to be going to shit. But this man reminded me that there are some people out there that seriously just care, regardless of how little they actually know you. I think I might have helped him out too. 

There was something so cathartic about telling someone your problems when you knew you'd never see them again. At the same time, as I was leaving MEPS to go back home and was saying my goodbyes, he said ""I have a feeling this won't be the last time we'll meet."" I hope he's right.

In any case, after looking him up on the internet multiple times, I finally found him on Facebook the other day - he has just recently gotten out of Basic and put a photo of him in his service uniform on there. Nothing had ever made me so purely happy before.

You know that little preamble that happens when you just arrive at a party? ""How are you/what have you been up to"", that kind of stuff. Nobody asked me a single thing about myself. Ive been entirely inactive on facebook for a little over a week now, nobody noticed or messaged me except one friend but 90% if the conversation was her talking about some guy shes hanging out with lately. Just every time we talk its always about him. 

Later in the night as people got more drunk some of them start making snide comments at me. Just making me the butt of jokes or talking down to me like a child. One guy outright suckerpunched me in the gut and was belligerently insulting me (but people looked the other way because thats how he normally is when hes drunk). 

Was also confirmed that my best friend, whom I had confessed my feelings for a few weeks ago (at first he acted like he was cool with it but got progressively snippier at me for unrelated things) was in fact talking to and hanging out with other people pretty regularly after having told me he was going into hermit mode. So basically he's just avoiding me. 

So today I deactivated my facebook. It's not worth having if people are straight up ignoring you or just end up shitting on you for whatever reason. It really fucking hurts. I try my hardest to be a good friend to people, I try to be supportive and always down to spend time but there's just something about me that people dislike, that makes them leave. Ive been trying to avoid posting my problems online so I dont bother anyone (i was on the verge of homelessness up until thursday so my stress levels have been through the roof) but even then nobody cares.
