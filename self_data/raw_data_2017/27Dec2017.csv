1,"At his coronation, Alexander the Great, pre-greatness, was to take a pinch of expensive incense and cast it into a fire as an offering to the Gods. To everyone's shock and horror, he instead took the entire container of what we in the modern world must understand was an extremely precious commodity... and set it ablaze. Was it arrogance, the carelessness of an entitled young man? Was it wisdom? Was it that he intuited that greatness can only be pursued by those willing to suffer great cost?  

I'm not sure how this is related to my terrible dental nerve infection. It's extremely painful, but I assume not worth anything. Didn't the voodoo queen of New Orleans, Marie Laveau stand at the Church altar with hot peppers in her mouth until blisters formed for some reason or another? In such religious traditions, it's believed that even spirits can be moved to action by the sight of someone suffering. I make a mental note to set aside some time this week to suffer more to see if it can do anything to improve my situation.

I boil water and in the hiss of gas I hear whispers. This is not so unusual. Which is to say, it's very unusual, but not for me. They aren't sinister or paranoid, but read as snippets of overheard conversation... the inconsequential words of strangers. Usually. 

The water bubbles, it blubs and *I didn't even know she had a tattoo* emerges. A woman's voice, it's a whisper, but an enthused one... scandalous. It goes on, but diffuses into softer gibberish, words as opposed to sentences. I forget why I was boiling water, perhaps tea, or perhaps oatmeal. My tooth hurts extremely badly. I pour the boiling water into the sink and turn the stove off, pointless.  

My apartment is not my apartment, in a sense I live in a monument to pity. I'm sure one day my roommates will ask me to start paying rent, and on that day I'll presumably leave.  

My thoughts are sticky and echo too long in my head. There's a synaesthetic equivalence between all things, the thoughts in my head are the whispers in the pan are the pain in my jaw are my mediocre life. I am a fractal of myself, down to the skeptical, schizophrenic neurons which sieve through ambient noise so observantly.  

Where was I? Fracture of the cervical veterbrae is rare in hanging suicides, the velocity required in the drop to snap the neck is not achievable by most people who choose this method. In most cases the cause of death is asphyxiation which results from compression of the airway and the carotid arteries which supply blood to the brain.  Due to the importance of continuous blood supply to the brain, loss of consciousness is known to be able to occur in as little as twenty seconds, much quicker than would be achieved by simply cutting off oxygen without restricting the arteries.  
 
My hopes for you have changed James. I recall having hopes that you were happy, hopes that you would please for the love of god cut your hair shorter, but leave some bangs in the front of course. There wasn't any reason to hide your face. I hoped that leaving this town behind was everything you needed it to be. Now I hope you used a sheet, something soft that wouldn't dig the deep black v shaped bruise left by ropes. I hope no fibers were found in your fingers from when you may have pulled at the rope or the chord with just enough life left to decide you didn't want to die. I hope that by some anomaly it took less than 20 seconds for your world to go dark.   

I don't think I told you about being in the institute last year, when my own brain was on the fritz, without even the excuse of pinched carotids. I'd meant to get around to it of course, I thought you'd get a kick out of the cup shaped door handles, sloped so that any string or chord would slip right off. Known as partial hanging, one can also use a portion of their body weight to pull down on a knot without the need for space the length of the body. This is a common method in prisons and institutions where full suspension is impossible. Victims of partial hanging are sometimes found in rigor mortis, frozen in a crouch or with feet turned up, as if still leaning towards the floor. 

My room mate at the institute had a forehead tattoo of a cross and believed there was only one police officer he could trust. He'd written... or rather *scrawled* a note and hidden it behind our particle board dresser.  

I read it with the utmost reverence, as outraged as he was about the conspiracy against him and the tangential tragedy of some sort of ex-girlfriends current boyfriend robbing him blind and stealing his Christmas presents. Manic-depressives in cases of severe manic episodes may experience psychosis, with delusions of being ""chosen"" or having to fight a personal war or mission. 50% of people with manic-depression will attempt suicde in their lives and cause of death by suicide is 20 times higher than in the general population. In other words, my room mate was the reason for the cup shaped door handles and probably the bars on the windows and maybe even the mandatory power-walking to 80s music in our no slip socks up and down the hallways because that activity certainly wasn't for my benefit. One doesn't truly understand suicidal ideation until they've shambled to Madonna's discography from the window over looking a funeral home to the more scenic window with a view of the cemetary, and then back again. I meant to joke with you how morbid that all was, a dark joke about the placement that I know you would have appreciated.

The night you died my eyes crossed with drunkenness under the moon. I hummed ""fuck the police"" under my breath for no real reason and a forty shook in my hand as I walked home from the corner store. Two raccoons seemed to have lazy sex in a front yard and I heard crickets underneath a ringing in my ears. It felt magical. Pretty much all animals fuck, but how often do you ever really see it?  

I fantasized about the cops coming to pick me up, my starting an unnecessary confrontation maybe and then... and then what? They kill me? Was that the idea, did I want that for myself. No, death didn't have much appeal, but did life? Was there not a third option here? I looked down at my booze, ah, there we go, there's the third option and I took a deep sip. I found myself thinking...  

If you were going to hurt me why didn't you just finish the job? Made one last round to your home town and taken me out so I really could be the kind of person we had laughed about over the sound of our own doubts and twisting nerves, people who were born, lived and died in this town. Had you offered I would have served you up a train ticket on a silver platter, god knows commuting to a murder suicide these days is costly and in this economy too. And cost wise James, I can only afford so many weapons in my arsenal against the feelings you've started, most of which also require a chaser. They say there's nothing I could of done and maybe, just MAYBE, they're right, but there are some things I fucking should have done and now I have no idea what to do.  

Did my living do to you what your dying has done to me? Or did you never look back after that night? And if you knew, if you could have answered those questions when you had blood and life why not tell me before killing yourself?
This is sick and guilty anger, I can't be mad at you without admitting that what you did has hurt me and I can't mourn you without hating what you've done. You're the helpless victim and the murderer. I want justice for and from you and I am disgusted with myself.  

Years later in New York City I was on the subway and I saw an emergency cord with a disclaimer underneath that said that the emergency cord was NOT for... fires, crimes, or medical emergencies. Is that not thee perfect metaphor for life? A choice with no options?  

I'm not sure where I'm going with this. I find it hard to eat, hard to sleep, hard to ignore the ice cold burning of my face. I'll cheer up, I'm sure, but... but even in my happy moments I can't help, but feel that someone has thrown me on the fire, or that I am the hot pepper. I feel like bait for the gods, drawing them in with pity, at the cost of my own slow demise. I am someone else's opportunity to be charitable and I don't aspire to much more.  

Are you still listening James? Icey rain is falling on the roof, and in the sound I hear a gently mocking laughter.

3,"I'm a 32 year old guy on disability. Up until recently, I got along by living (nearly) rent and utility free with my grandparents. Now it's just my grandfather who's terminally ill, and my uncle. My grandfather has wanted me to find somewhere I could afford to live so when he dies, I won't immediately end up homeless. The plan was for me to ""switch places"" with my mom, who shares a house with my younger sister and one year old niece. I'd pay a third of the utilities and rent, which I could barely manage, and my mom and sister would pay the rest. It was charity on my mom's part, and not something she could really afford either, but it was something.

Then she had a stroke. She's recovering well, but she doesn't have any income now and debts are piling up, not to mention being behind on the utilities my sister (and I) are inheriting.

Pooling our money together, it's just not enough. My sister works two jobs along with having a toddler. I'm on a fixed income. We're going to be about $400 short every month, before I factor in food for myself. At least the kid is taken care of through WIC and SNAP benefits. All these years, I could only have saved up anything by stuffing it under my mattress or directly lying to the federal government -- once you hit a certain amount of collected assets, especially money, they cut you off. That amount is ridiculously low.

It's possible, though unlikely, my sister could bail somehow, maybe live with a friend. I don't have that option. The few friends I have are either un- or underemployed and living with family as well. If I can't afford to pay for what I have now, I can't imagine I could afford to even find a roommate on craigslist or something. I've looked. 

Everyone here's fucked, it seems. Subsidized housing is so scarce that the years-long waiting lists are simply cut off. I doubt I would qualify anyway, since I don't have a lot of work history and I'm not over 65.

I'm just a burden with a bum leg and a bad brain.",27Dec2017,2
4,"So I guess the best place to start is by saying that I love my family very, very much, but unfortunately I barely ever get to see them. When I was 8 years old we moved states and so I really never get to see any of my grandparents, aunts, uncles or cousins. Hell, even my dad eventually moved away after my parents got divorced, so now all I'm left with is my mother, stepfather and some step siblings that I barely ever see.

Basically, the holidays tend to get really lonely around here. I'm now 20 years old and I usually never have any plans for the holidays, but this year I finally got a girlfriend. And I don't mean any girlfriend, this woman is truly special. We instantly clicked and I truly believe that someday, eventually, I will end up marrying her. Anyway, on to the events of Christmas evening.

We decided to go over to my girlfriend's aunt's house because my parents worked that night and so were sleeping. Now you gotta understand that I am very socially awkward and shy, plus many of the people here besides my gf and her mother were people that I had only met a couple of times tops. This basically means that I was super nervous, but the night wore on and I somehow settled into it.

Her family is just so... welcoming, it was a crazy experience. I barely knew most of these people yet here we were, playing cards against humanity and laughing our asses off over vulgarity. It really was amazing how welcomed I felt. But then I began to feel something else, something bad. It was... jealousy I guess, a certain sad kind of jealousy if that makes any sense. I saw her family there, surrounded by good friends, having the time of their lives, and what did I have? What was my family doing?

I didn't even know, I couldn't even tell you when the last time I saw my uncle was, that's how long it's been. It really saddened me, the fact that she had all of this loving and supporting family so close to her, and while I loved my family so much, they lived over a thousand miles away. It's strange how I could feel so lonely while being surrounded by so many great people. 

Later on that night, everyone was saying their goodbyes, we were getting ready to leave. My girlfriend's mother turned to her, gave her this great big hug and said how much she loved her. I stood back, thinking once again to my mental loneliness. It was then that she turned to me and said ""I like this kid a lot, too."" and gave me a hug. My heart melted. That moment meant so much to me, it was such a small gesture but the fact that she accepted me into her family, that everyone including my girlfriend had been so loving even though we've only dated about 4 and a half months, was so beautiful.

I almost cried on the drive back home. I was so happy that her family was so accepting, yet at the same time I felt such a great sadness. I miss my family, and even when I get to visit them it's not for long, I'm probably never going to have a Christmas dinner with them again like I used to all those years ago. So I don't know. I don't really know the point of this post, and I honestly don't really understand my feelings. Everything is such a mixed bag right now. I guess that at the end of the day I can either choose for it to be a happy thing or a sad thing, and I choose for it to be happy.",27Dec2017,4
5,"I'm just so sad. I miss her even though I don't. I feel like I was broken up with even though I left her. I know about cognitive dissonance and that's great and all but how the hell do I deal with this? The shit my ex pulled was bad. For me personally, it was traumatic. I hate to say that because it feels so dramatic but I'm beginning to think it was. I'm not going into detail here because, as far as I know, whoever responds to this could be anyone and those events are definitely meant to be talked about with my therapist. That said though I'd love some advice on how to move on. I mean shit man it's a been a little over a year now and I'm still fucked up about leaving her. 

For a long time I didn't want to be mad at her or see anything that she did wrong because I wanted to be the nice guy but that is literally killing me. I want to become this vile monster of a man who doesn't care about anyone and uses violence to solve his problems but that isn't me and I refuse to become that. I've been trying to motivate myself to go to the gym and eat better and all that shit but at the end of the day I've said ""I'm gonna change for real this time!"" About 7 fuckin times. I do want to change. 

I just found out that this girl is going to the same university as I am and I'm honestly scared to go back. Not of physical violence, if she would've hit me with the intent to hurt me like that I'd hit her back, but I'm scared because of all the mean things she, and her friends, said to me after I left her the second time. I'm scared because she is the only person, beside my mother who would never do this, can absolutely destroy me. Can I do that to her too? I think so. Can I use my 6 foot 2 inch stature and wide shoulder build to intimidate whatever poor sap is her new boyfriend? Almost definitely. But there is one thing she can say that will hurt more than anything. More than when she claimed I wasn't disciplined because I didn't wash dishes every night after work while she sat at home not doing anything. More than the time she told me to 'do whatever I want, it's what I do anyway,m'  even though every waking moment I spent trying to help her with her illness and just caring for her in general. More than when she told me in an email after I left her the second time that said she ""deserved better.""  Cliche as that may be it still hurt because I want to be the greatest boyfriend/husband I can be. She can tell me that our relationship meant nothing and that I meant nothing to her. 

I am mostly aware that she thinks that already but confirmation is worse than uncertain worry for me. 

I don't know man. I don't know what to do anymore. I try and be a ""good man,"" and do shit to help people and without fail I've been screwed each time. My mother told me to ""do unto others what you would have done unto you,"" and I've always been that way. I still am for the most part. But I can feel that slipping away. I can literally feel my anger seeping out of me like a poison. I wish genuine ill on people sometimes and I have to remind myself that I don't mean it I'm just mad. I find myself fantasizing about beating my ex's new boyfriend to a pulp, I fantasize about her saying something nasty to me on the streets of our university and I roar at her. Literally an inhumane roar. Looming over her like an animal, watching her fear, feeding off of it. Drinking in the thought that I am now something that horrifies her. But I know that I don't want that, not really. 

I just don't want someone who I loved to hurt me anymore. ",27Dec2017,1
7,"This seems to be how the world works.

I read a book over the weekend, 'Slowness' by Milan Kundera, and the theme, to me after a first time read, was that the possibility of an experience in an existence fundamentally and irreversibly changes that existence regardless of whether or not that experience occurs. I connected this to mindfulness. Be aware of what you can and cannot change and accept it. Do not begrudge the world for what it is, but move forward and live the life you want with the circumstances you are given.

I've spent the last year and a half pissed off that life isn't how I want it to be. I revel in my sour attitude. I think it puts me above the unenlightened masses who do not understand their plight; the frivolity of existence. I want to feel shitty and superior.

That's a bullshit way to go through life.

This book was a change of pace for me. I was home for the holidays from a city I didn't want to move to for a job served as the next step in a life I thought I could not escape. Instead of making the best of an admittedly not so bad situation (I have income, a means to pay off debt, new friends, and I am succeeding) I consume all kinds of media that reinforce what I think of my world. Depressing music, melodramatic films and movies, Reddit comments I disagree with (this hasn't changed hahah) and other similar escapes.

Leading up to reading this book I decided to check out some new music. Something a little deeper than ""my life is hard and I'm depressed"", and I felt better. That led me to reading this book. I felt even better. I went back to work after the holiday (today) and immediately fell back into my habit of sad tunes while working and noticed my familiar mood taking hold again.

I had a smoke outside after work. I started another book (again by Milan Kundera, good shit, check him out) and was halfway through a glass of wine. Good thinking vibes were all around.

I can't go back to a world I never lived in where we aren't assaulted by advertising and distractions at every turn. They shape who we are and how we feel. That's just how it is. I can, however, limit what I consume to things that benefit me, or at least don't make me feel like an undeserving piece of garbage. I need to take advantage of the things I cannot escape to improve my situation and to make me happy.

I hope this motivation lasts. I'll return to this if it doesn't.",27Dec2017,8

11,"Um hi to everyone this may concern. This is very nerve-wracking for me but I have to let it out. I'm suicidal, mostly because of my dad, and have attempted suicide once but none of my family knows. Before you answer let me tell you what's been going on.

I was born and raised in the US. My dad is a super religious d head. From the start he put me in a private school so that I could learn more about my religion and he has been verbally and physically abusing me for as long as I can remember. If I wasn't doing well in my religion classes he would screw me up, but he wouldn't say a thing about how great I did in my other classes. I'd always want to know why he was being like that but I was too afraid to ask. After my first year of middle school he put me in homeschooling in order to advance my religous studies. He found a tutor who he thought could help. The tutor told us that I'd have to learn religion from the basics but my dad decided to go with it anyway. The tutor wasn't a nice guy. The whole day he'd either fall asleep or scratch his dandruff. He couldn't teach anything well at all including religion. I tried to tell my dad but of course he never listened. A year went by and not only did nothing improve but things just got a whole lot worse. My dad decided to take it to a whole new level by sending me to another country to attend a school that only teaches religion. I have to get up at 5am, then study, then have breakfast at 7am, then study, then have lunch at 11am, then sleep until 1pm, then study until 4pm, then have break, then eat dinner at 7pm, then study until 10pm, and then finally sleep. It's only closed one day a week. I've been here for over 3 years and I don't think I can take it anymore. A lot of things are making me depressed; teachers, food, homesickness, studying, loneliness, etc. I just want to come back home. My parents won't listen to me and I don't want to call authorities because my dad will go to jail. What should I do now?",27Dec2017,1

15,"TL;DR - Do I make myself unhappy or is it who I hang out with that makes me unhappy?

I don't know if it's me but I am never truly happy. I never truly enjoy a moment of my life the same way as I see some people do online. I know it's not right to compare my full life with the life people pick and choose to show everyone online but the problem is that there is never a time where I am truly happy. 

When I am alone I am upset that I'm by myself and not hanging out with friends. When I am with my friends I realise that I can never tell them anything secret or express myself to them because they're constantly either talking shit about other people or talking about something really negative.

There has never been a time where I hang out with my friends and think to myself - ""Oh wow I've got a great bunch of friends and I love them"". Almost everyone in my friend group is the same way except a couple (who are genuinely nice). All they talk about is games and things that don't interest me. I just want friends where I can hang out with at night and talk to about anything. I don't want friends who don't have lives and talk dirty about other people. 

On the other side it could be my fault. I never open up to people about things because of my past and I am a little anxious being around people (getting judged) so that might affect the way people see me and as a result our friendship won't be as close as other people's. (My friends in our friend group are close to each other). 

What should I do? Should I try to get with a more positive group of people and stray away from the old ones? Or am I the one at fault for not being positive myself? My thoughts are convoluted at the moment but I can try to elaborate on anything that you might need to know in order to help my quality of life. Thank you for reading.",27Dec2017,6

We both just got out of relationships, she has liked me for a while and I needed to get my Ex girlfriend out of my system so I invited the new chick over for drinks last night...

This girl is not completely unfortunate looking, but she is squarely on the chubby side. She was awesome to talk to, smart, witty and aims to please. Her personality is a gold mine (she might be a little crazy, but our crazies mesh) but I am just not that sexually attracted to her.

My last girlfriend had the body of a Greek Goddess, but lacked the ability to challenge me intellectually, which is something I crave. It was the source of many of our problems. The new girl intimidates me with how smart she is, which I find incredibly attractive but I cant get over the fact she is a little bigger and it is fucking with me.

I know looks fade and if I find her to be such a good fit, in terms of our personalities, why can't I get over the fact that she does not have the perfect body?

I was raised by a middle class family. A typical run of the mill family with no financial support from grandparents. My parents worked very hard to give me and my brother the best education. That was the sole driving aim in their lives to give us everything they didnt have. 

After high school I managed to get myself a full ride to one of the top schools in the US. I had 4 years of amazing opportunities in front of me. How did I spend it? I spent it just wasting my life after a girl amongst a lot of other things. I never did manage to get a good GPA and i just trudged along. I had no idea what I'd do after I graduated. 

Three days after my graduation my brother committed suicide. I was the last person to speak to him. I came back home to my country be with my parents. They had already lost a son. With time they recovered a little but never really demanded anything from me anymore. If my brother were here I am pretty sure they'd be disappointed in how badly I had fared through college. I honestly dont even know why I didnt work hard. I just didnt. I have a decent job now but I am nowhere near what I could have been. 

Everyone who was with me is doing so much better. And living their life in amazing countries. And I am just here. Getting by the day. Most of those people don't even speak to me anymore.
