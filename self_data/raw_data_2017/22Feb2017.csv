1,So around the year 2000 Yahoo mail had a thing where you could write an email to yourself and they would deliver it to you at your yahoo email address in 20 years. I only have like 3 more years to go! But I have a feeling that it's not going to happen. I try and google to find out any information about this and nothing comes up. Does anyone else remember this and did anyone else do it? ,22Feb2017,2
3,"I knew this girl from school where we had a class together and we always had a similar sense of humour. I found myself crushing on her later as we left school so I decided to message her. We got talking more and more often and eventually were talking everyday for like most of the day. At one point we were each other's top best friends on Snapchat (had that stupid yellow love heart thing lol). Anyway, my friends told me she's out of league so many times, but I thought I was in with a chance. So I told her how I felt.

Apparently she already knew I'd felt that way previously but didn't know if I still did. She never told me how she felt, but I suppose that was an answer in itself. I just told her that yeah I do, and that I'm sorry if it makes things awkward. She said it honestly doesn't at all. But it did. After having talked everyday we didn't talk the next day. And the day after. And the week after. I saw her the next week at the only club in my town (you see like everyone there all the time). I went and said sorry to her for making things awkward again. She has this look in her eye like she felt really bad for me, and she just repeated it was all fine and gave me a big hug.

After that I saw her in that club a couple of times. We hadn't messaged or anything. One time we outright ignored each other as we walked by. The time after we just smiled at each other. Things had for sure got weird. A few more times we bumped into each other but they all kinda merge together. Very little was said between us at all. I was just trying to avoid her in all honesty to get over her, and I assumed she was doing the same so she didn't have to deal with the awkwardness. One thing I did notice was that she would also retweet something I retweeted like a day or two after we'd been avoiding each other or whatever. Chalked it up to coincidence though.

I walked by her on New Year's night and she shouted 'happy new year!' At me, clearly drunk as hell. That was the first time we'd even interacted in a month or two, and I hate to admit but I still had a thing for her. Not as intense, but whenever I seen her it would all come back. Anyway after that I noticed her liking a lot of things I was retweeting, and then she retweeted a post later saying something like 'liking someone's tweets just to remind them you exist'.

I was a bit confused. Like I was sure she wouldn't want to talk to me anymore. I met one of her best friends on the way home university one day and got talking. The usual polite shit like what we're up to nowadays. She said 'you're at uni now aren't you?' And went on to name the subjects I was doing. This girl was like an acquaintance at best, there's no way she'd know this unless she was told by the girl, which means she's been talking to her friends about me. Things kinda dried up again until the other night when I saw her again. This time though she ran up to me shouting my name all excited, gave me a hug, and she was all like 'how've you been?' and we got talking at the bar for a couple of minutes, which is the most we've talked in ages. It was nice. After that, guess what, the last couple of days she's back to retweeting and liking what I retweet.

What's going on here? I'd given up on her but it seems like she's trying to drag me back in, or more likely, misses me as a friend. I mean I miss her too but even now I still have a thing for her and I know talking again extensively's just gonna feel like shit when I still have feelings and nothing's gonna happen. What do I do here? Am I looking into things too much?

 **TL;DR**: Massive thing for girl. Talked for months on end. Told her how I felt. She had known but never told me how she feels back. Things got awkward as we kept bumping into each other at this club at the weekend. At first we'd talk a little but eventually we were ignoring each other basically. Now though she seems to want to talk to me/misses me as a friend and it seems like she's been talking to her friends about me. I still like her though and don't want to get hurt.

A company ""Chongqing Shindary"" has made a job offer to them, and the job seems a little sketchy.
Apparently they send you information through email of purchases from their website, or wherever, and send you the money by check.
Once you get the money, you cash it out and put it on a REloadit card. After that, you email them the PIN of the REloadit and a receipt of the transaction. The transaction equals the purchase amount minus a transport fee, card purchase fee, and spiff (Bonus to employee) which you reimburse yourself for.

15,"Hey there. So I'm selling small photo pendant thingies online. They're not particularly unique or hard to come by, but I'm doing okay selling them locally as a small hobby side business, and I want to be able to send them overseas too if someone wants one.

However, I have to send this crap out from Australia to the US and other countries. It's expensive, so I'm trying to squeeze them into the cheapest shipping option I have, but I really need to make sure it works before I go making actual sales.

So I need some help receiving the item and letting me know if it got there okay, and how long it took.

I need at least two people in the USA, and at least one person in the UK. I don't mind if I send a few to other countries as well (not Australia though).

The item I will be sending out at this stage is a small heart shaped (edit: or circular) chain charm like [this](http://i.imgur.com/2dB17Qf.jpg). It's about 2.5 cm across and can have a picture added under the glass.

What I need you to do is:

- Send me a photo you want in it (or say you're happy with a blank one, they still look nice)

- Tell me where to ship it

- When you receive it, tell me so I know how long it took to get there, and if it was in okay condition. If you could snap a pic on your phone and send it back that'd be a nice bonus. If you **don't** receive it after three weeks, I need to know that too.

In return for helping me out you can keep the item for free. I won't be spamming the name of the business or asking you to advertise it, this is a genuine postage test and not an advertising thing. Since this is a test of postage I don't, of course, guarantee that you'll ever receive it.

Don't put addresses in the comments, PM them. Feel free to use a throwaway account and/or fake name (as long as you'll receive it), and I don't care if it's your home/work/PO box/whatever. 

However, please don't agree if you're not going to message me when you receive it. I need to know either way. I will send a reminder message to you if I don't hear back, but otherwise all I can do is assume it never got to you.

If you decide to help me out, thanks in advance!",22Feb2017,1

Human life exists simply to end. This baffles me. Don't get me wrong, there are so many beautiful things in this world! Watching my children grow fills me with so much love and beauty. But, at the end of the day I still have that lingering feeling. All that I do, every private thought I ever think will simply disappear with me.

32,"I kinda just want to post my thoughts right now, so if you want to read, go ahead.

During high school, I wasn't much of a social person. I guess you can say I'm a  somewhat attractive guy, but I'm pretty boring. The only reason I had friends in high school was because I met all of them back in middle and elementary school. I never really got into a romantic relationship with a girl because I was always afraid of rejection. I did have a really close relationship with one girl, but it never escalated.

I am now in college and am trying to open myself some more. I'm in my second semester of my first year right now.

During my first semester, I had sex for the first time and the girl got attached. I am person who likes to put everyone in front of myself, so I decided to date her for her sake. I was not happy during the 2 months we were together in all honesty. I broke with her right after finals. Besides that, I was still keeping to myself a lot. I was only friends with my roommates and others who I met through my roommates.

Now during this semester, I finally got to being more friendly and open with everyone. I tried drinking and smoking for the first time and it was fun! Not to say that the only way to have is doing those activities, but I enjoyed them and they helped me meet new people. When drinking, I met a girl. I was super nervous, but I decided to approach her. We started talking and I got her snapchat. We were only talking through their and we would say hi when we would see each other in the halls (we live in the same building). I knew if I didn't do anything to talk to her in real life, nothing would ever happen. So, I decided to ask her out to dinner (in person, of course) and she agreed! We ate dinner and then came back to campus and just walked and talked. I let her know that I was interested in her and she said she was interested in me as well. That doesn't seem like much, but I've never had anything like this happen, so I was excited to hear that. Right now, I'm still talking to her, seeing how much we connect before I ask her to be my girlfriend.

Besides having another intersted in me, I also met new people on my own! Whenever I would see anyone with an interesting piece of clothing, or would overhear that we enjoyed the same honby, I would chime in and compliment or let them know I liked the same thing.

I know this all seems like what any normal would already do, but this is all new and exciting for me. I was never really happy during high school. I would just go to school, go to work, and then go home. Every once in a while I would go out with the few friends I had, but that's about it. I am actually enjoying life for once, and I just wanted to share that with anybody who would listen to me.

I am happy.

Even though we didn't talk much back in high school, you were the closest thing I ever had to a best friend. Sure I had people like me and people that were chill with me, but you were my favourite. I absolutely hate myself for acting like a prick and completely ignoring you whenever you tried saying hi to me. Don't know why I did it, I guess I just missed you too much and didn't know what to say because I thought you were gone forever.

Yes, I'm talking about the people we see on the memes that are shared widely on the internet. Do they like their pictures getting shared such widely? Imagine, if someday a picture of you, taken by someone went such viral? Would you like it? Would you like if it becomes a sticker and is shared widely on instant messengers? What about your digital footprint? Last year, a Pakistani tea seller went viral on the internet, without his consent obviously. http://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/pakistani-tea-seller-turns-model-after-viral-photo-1.3123716 Think about it. You get skeptic about your digital privacy when a smartphone app asks permission to access your photos; those people have already had their photos shared on the internet, very likely, without their consent. Do you think that we should now stop sharing memes and that social media companies should not allow sharing of memes?

I abused the hell out of those little guys for a whole year until my body couldn't take it anymore and I quit. After that I fell into a nasty depression and i'm now on other meds for that, and the doc said I needed a little more motivation so he prescribed me the Aptensio, which is a Ritalin based drug for ADHD. 

On the very first day, I took five of them. Worst decision of my fucking life. The rush was incredible and god how I missed it so. But in the end, all I got in return was an unwanted all nighter with a MASSIVE panic attack during that time. I honestly don't know how I'm still here. To put this in perspective, I'm sixteen.

48,"As a part time Uber driver in a major American city, and as a late-40s male with growing suspected prostate issues, sometimes I have to take a small break to go to the bathroom. No big deal, right? Stop at a gas station or a fast food restaurant and do your business, back on your way.

What I have discovered is eye-opening and rather troubling. Most business in the city have placed prominent signs on their doors stating ""BATHROOMS FOR PAYING CUSTOMERS ONLY"". Even gas stations. A good number of them actually have locks on the doors so you must find a store employee to let you in, after you've bought something, of course.

Now, this wouldn't be a big deal if one had other options, but at least in my town, there are none. Public bathrooms, as disgusting and dangerous as they have been perceived in the past, at least existed for use in an emergency. Now they don't. Whether they've been closed and gotten rid of out of safety, or budget cuts, or whatever is unknown, and you'd probably get 10 different answers from 10 different public officials. But the message is clear: going to the bathroom isn't free.

And lest you think ""well, I'm gonna pee my pants if I don't go right now, I'll pull into a secluded area and go on a bush""... that's a gigantic no-no, too. If caught, you'll get a hefty fine at best, and thrown in jail as a sex offender at worst. The few times I've had to resort to this, I have driven around in agony to try to find a suitable spot, and been scared shitless someone will see me.

I can only imagine what kind of hell this is like for homeless or semi-homeless people. They have been relegated to the quasi-criminal for simply doing their human business in an unsafe, unclean environment that not only risks them but presents dangers to the community in general through unhygienic waste.

What's the answer? As with most societal problems, the solutions are just a nebulous and complex as the problems.

49,"Does anyone on this sub have experience with mental or psychiatric hospitals? I've done a shit-ton of research and reading for the past few days, but I also do want to hear some personal anecdotes.




I believe I'm very near the end of my rope, especially with my extreme suicidal thoughts, nervousness and possible panic attacks, and I do feel that voluntarily checking myself into a psychiatric hospital would be in my best interest. I would be doing it indefinitely, because I don't know if I can honestly survive very well outside of a psychiatric hospital and because I believe I would be a genuine and constant threat to myself the second I get out. So I will stay as long as it takes, even if its the rest of my life. 




I know I would need shit like my social security, birth certificate, I.D., and I know I'm covered by Medicare or some shit. And I will have to fill out some paperwork. If I'm missing something, I doubt a hospital will just turn me away, because they are almost obligated to help me. I also know I will be examined and given a physical, and have to take an assessment or something. I very likely have BPD or bipolar disorder, OCD, depression and major anxiety issues, so speaking to a doctor or psychiatrist about this would be great before I am admitted.





Finally, if it makes a difference, I'm 19 years old. But I don't want my family knowing where I am or why and I want to cut off all contact with them, because my grandparents are narcissists and my other family members are enablers or neglectful. I don't care if I won't have any visitors, I just want to get away from them. 
I'm thinking of leaving a note saying that I left of my own accord and I wasn't kidnapped and that would be the end of that.





I'm planning on getting the fuck out of here and calling or going to a hospital and asking to be admitted to a nearby psychiatric hospital. Is that all I have to do, or how do I admit myself?





Except there are several in my area and I don't know which one to go to or particularly care which I go to, but I also want to go to a psychiatric hospital outside of my area. I'm concerned about my family tracking me down or looking for me because they will be mad as hell and won't understand and I will legit be concerned for my very safety and well-being if they find out what happened or what I'm planning. 




I'm thinking of getting out of my home or state very soon and then just checking myself into a psychiatric hospital. I have almost nothing except the clothes on my back, basic essentials like soap, razor and shaving cream, toilet paper, and a small amount of money. I know they will check my stuff and most sharp objects aren't allowed.

51,About five months ago I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/53p25s/just_respond_damnit/) post about a girl I'd met. It is hard to think that I've only known her for less than half a year. I wouldn't call her my girlfriend exactly but we aren't platonic friends either (She isn't the type to make a habit of making out with platonic friends.) We just seem to click very nicely. I've met her friends and they feel very much like my own friends do. Hanging out with her still feels more like talking with an old friend than anything else. She is really busy most of the time (trying to do a four year degree in three years) which causes some problems (especially because she often will read texts and then forget about them).,22Feb2017,2

55,"My post was removed from /r/relationships and told to post here. Hopefully I can get some advice.

I have been going to counselling at my university for the past five weeks, and it has been going well. My schedule is loaded with different stuff each week, and I get pretty stressed since I never really have a day to myself. Also, I’m in my last year, approaching graduation, so the pressure is really on.

Anyway, through these sessions, my counsellor and I have discovered things about myself. They are things that are really affecting me, but I have no way of going about actively changing the situation. She will not give me direct advice necessarily, which I understand, but it is quite irritating.

I know therapy takes time - I've been to several counsellors since I was 12 - but surely there are things I can do right now?

**FIRST PROBLEM**

I have a very negative self-perception. My worries are largely about what others are thinking of me – the way I walk, talk, smile, create eye contact – everything about me. I feel pretty unattractive and that no one is ever really interested in me romantically. If they are, then (a) I would not see it until it is too late, (b) misread it, or (c) not know how to go about reciprocating.

It’s even more damaging when I am self-conscious about being a minority. I guess this stems from my hard luck in online dating (from Tinder, to OkCupid, to Bumble, to eHarmony, to Match, to CMB), but I feel like my chances are significantly limited by being black. As if it means women that I am attracted to will never really feel the same way about me.

How do I actively change this?

I want it to stop, but it feels as though everyday this idea is being perpetuated in social interactions and even over messaging. For instance, when I look at someone from afar, I am scared to hold eye contact. Especially with women I am attracted to.

**SECOND PROBLEM**

I definitely have a fear of being rejected. Growing up as a teenager was not great. My attendance was well below average, I was barely getting through each year, and I was physically and verbally bullied for years. Particularly about how I look and my skin (“You’ve got a massive forehead”, “You have huge lips” “You’re so black that (insert racist joke)”). I hated being black.

Then people coming into my life and telling me that I am some problem child, instead of actually understanding what the issue was, worsened it. My Dad may as well be dead, because he has not been an active part of my life since I was about 14. I don’t talk to any of my closest cousins, in terms of proximity, on a regular basis, the youngest of which is about 31.

I have been told before that I would always be miserable, have no friends, I am a compulsive liar, to “Shut up and stop crying” (thanks Dad), and that I am a ‘pussy’ by my cousin because I was deathly afraid of boarding a flight at 16. He later apologised on the next flight, but it has stuck with me since then.

None of the people that did these things talk to me. None of them have ever spontaneously rang or texted me to say, “Hi, how are you?”

Maybe that’s why all I want is to be loved back? What do I do?

THIRD PROBLEM

I do not want to come off as a creep to women, or desperate. Considering that I go to a majority female university (something like 60%) and never kissed a girl here, let alone slept with one, since I was 16, I feel as though I have blown my chance at being in the best possible position to experience sexual freedom? It’s weird.

There have been a few times where I thought it might go somewhere, but then it doesn’t and then I blame myself. I am not socially inept. I can easily strike a conversation up with girls, make them laugh, and we get on well. Oftentimes, they add me on Facebook, too. I dress pretty well, go to the gym when I can, and remain actively involved in sports. I know what I want to do outside of university.

But I am scared to death of asking a girl out and then word getting out that I did. That then turning into “That guy is such a creep”. It bothers me more than it should, definitely. Then I see people together and I think to myself, ‘What is that guy doing that I am not?’

Particularly in clubs with my friends, I feel so out of place. I’m not a club guy, but all I want is to dance with a girl, maybe make out, and see where it goes. It doesn’t have to involve sex. Any advice here?

**WHAT DO I DO?**

I have been told by an (ex-) friend that I have a lot more going than I know. Which is probably true. But I doesn’t stop me from feeling down about myself a lot of the time. Here is an example of what is bothering me:

- Met this girl on a course. We click; similar ages, ambitions, ideas, likes, dislikes (etc). She is also single. She adds me on Facebook – probably with a lot of other people.

- We lose contact for a bit because we are both busy. I message her to see what’s up. We talk for a little bit, but then she stops. That’s fine.

- We bump into each other in person, talk and catch up. We part ways. This was actually the day after Valentine’s Day. I go home and message her a teasing GIF about her being ill with a cold.
The GIF was one of Dumbo (the Disney character, she worked at Disney for 3 years before university) sneezing. I said “This is you sneezing”. No response. I went on the main Facebook page later and saw she got into a relationship 11 hours ago.

I have not spoken to her since. I felt sort of bad, but I don’t want to come off as needy. I also didn’t mean to be harsh either, it was a light-hearted joke. Maybe I should have included an emoji.
Does it even really matter now considering that she is in a relationship?

Any advice?

**TL;DR:** I have problems that are stopping me from being happy. I feel unattractive, unloved, and just want someone to like me like I like them. Can you help?",22Feb2017,1

63,"About once a month, I get an envelop mailed to my house from Guangdong, China. These packages have all been sent directly to me (they have me written down as the recipient) and they have all have came from the same address. This has been going on for about a year. The envelopes contain anything from absolutely nothing at all, to one word notes, to cheap gifts. Everyone online seems to agree that this is part of a scam, but I have only ever used Amazon for online shopping, and even on there, I have never connected a credit card for payment; I only use gift cards to make payments and to increase my balance. My balance has stayed steady for several months, so that can't be it. Why do these people keep sending me stuff?

Worth mentioning that the packages have the word ""gift"" handwritten on them (small).",22Feb2017,305
65,"I don't know what I'm going to get out of writing this but maybe it'll do something. I've reached the edge of my sanity. I've spent the whole day wanting to jump in front of a car and end my pathetic existence. I feel so alone and so broken. 

How did this start? I don't know. I think I've always been a failure. Never got the highest grades, never was the most athletic, never was the most social, just a shell of an empty existence. I'm in my last year of college and I see no point in continuing on, I won't make it to graduation, I won't make it to med school, I won't become a doctor. I'm just an empty shell taking up space in this reality. Everything feels so empty. I feel so hollow. My grip on reality is slowly fading and the day will soon come when I take a step in front of a speeding car and the empty shell of my existence will be no more, hopefully to be taken up by a better use. 

I've been seeing two guys. Both nice people. Both have a good path before them, they don't need me involved in their lives. I messaged them both before this post, ""I'm sorry this is out of the blue but we can't see each other anymore and I'm going to ask that you also don't contact me. Just let me be."" And like that, I pushed away two guys I cared about. But it's ok, they won't miss me or have a second thought. No one will. I can't be loved. I can't be adored. I can't be cared about. It's just me in this empty shell. I am just an empty shell. Soon the day will come when this empty shell is no more and until then, I'll watch as my sanity fades and my biological need for survival dissipates.  ",22Feb2017,5
66,"A heavily suicidal person wants to be dead as much as most people enjoy being alive. Pressuring them into staying alive is basically saying ""You can't do what you want most because **I** want to be in your presence sometimes."" It's throwing away someone's deepest needs because you feel you can slightly benefit from them. It's so selfish and it feels like being kept as a fucking pet by society. The stigma against suicide is far worse than murder in my opinion.",22Feb2017,5
