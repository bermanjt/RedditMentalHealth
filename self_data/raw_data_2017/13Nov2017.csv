0,"I never had many friends until my last two years in high school. Even then we kinda lost touch after that. I only have four friends at all, one of whom I haven’t seen in literally a year and another I met online and we call frequently. I just want someone who knows me well to talk to and that doesn’t happen often or at all. I also feel like since I never had many friends I’m not quite sure how to go about making them in a college environment, especially since none of them go to my college and three of them didn’t even go to the same high school as me. My biggest fear is that since I never had many friends I simply don’t really know how to establish any kind of connection beyond “this guy who shows up occasionally and who no one really talks to.” I really wanted to be able to re-invent myself in college but I’m falling into the same rut and am scared it’s going to be my life now.",13Nov2017,6

2,"So it's college application season, and I'm a senior in high school, so I've had a lot thinking to do

I've always been very successful in school without ever having to put much effort. I don't want to sound like I'm bragging but I've always been a top 1% student with 4.0, 35 ACT, national merit finalist, etc, and I never really had to work for it. Now I have to think about college applications and my future and all that, and all I can think about is that I'm wasting whatever ""gift"" I have because I never really put in any effort. Every time I think about it I get closer to deciding to just go to my in-state school, but I always feel almost a bit guilty that I never really pushed myself.

Anyway, I guess I just wanted to actually tell someone how I feel because I can't really get myself to talk anyone about it. I'm sure everyone out there is laughing at some kid who thinks he has actual problems, but I'm kind of starting to hate myself over this.",13Nov2017,2

10,"So you’ve found yourself facing sexual assault allegations when people are beginning to take them seriously. Are the old statements like, “I don’t even know her,” “she was asking for it,” “I’m a man I can’t be responsible for my acts,” and “it’s just locker room talk” not holding up the way they used to? Never fear! With these 7 easy steps you can write your own apology and be back to your career as if none of this ever happened!

STEP 1
Admitting it Happened:
When constructing your apology it is tempting to go with the old rhetoric. These days there are too many female journalists and lawmakers influencing public opinion to get away with blatant misogyny. So it’s time to try a new approach. Steer clear from the tired “oops, my bad” language and remember that you can no longer deflect by [tweeting your denial](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.gq.com/story/ed-westwick-notes-app-response/amp), [coming out as gay,](https://twitter.com/kevinspacey/status/924848412842971136), [victim blaming](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/10/563240298/i-have-never-engaged-in-sexual-misconduct-moore-says-in-statement), or claiming that you can’t help it if your fans admire [you so much](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/arts/television/louis-ck-statement.amp.html). Instead, this would be a good time to admit all forms of assault and sexual harassment towards women and men of all ages that you may have committed in the past, whether or not there’s been an expose written about it in the New York Times. If you’re having a hard time remembering all of the people you’ve raped, exposed yourself too, harassed, groped, stalked, assaulted, or abused, talk it through with a friend. Create a timeline and retrace your steps. Don’t forget to check your court records, emails, and media accusations to refresh your memory!

STEP 2
Admitting Guilt:
 This is one of the most important parts of an apology! Make sure you go out of your way to admit that it was your fault. But be careful! Don’t fall into the trap of adding a “but she was asking for it,” or “I asked if it was ok first,” or “sure this was bad, but you should see what the other guys did,” as it will undercut the sincerity of your tone. Instead use words like “no excuse,” “my fault,” and “I’m a horrible person who thought that I could get away with misogyny because everyone else was doing it.”

STEP 3
Checking Your Privilege:
You’ve started your statement by recalling all acts of abuse, past, present, and for the forward thinking among us, future, and admitted guilt. Now what? Well it’s time to check your privilege! Remember even if you thought the other person was asking for it, wanted it, or used language that might indicate consent, if them saying “no” could lead to any physical, personal, political, or professional fall out then it qualifies as assault. Examples of inability to give consent include: if the person is a minor, if the person is drunk or you or someone else has drugged them, if they are an employee, if you are bigger, stronger or could physically injure them, if they are in the same industry where you have power and influence, if you are holding a weapon, if their career is on the line, if you are thinking about casting them in a show, movie, play, Olympic event, tour, musical event, etc. Now that you have some more context, take a minute now to go back to step one and add any additional assaults you may have missed.
WARNING: Be careful of “playing dumb” when checking your privilege. Saying things like [“I didn’t know at the time,” “I learned too late,” “I’m just going to take time to listen”](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/arts/television/louis-ck-statement.amp.html)  may feel like the strongest way to go but it can quickly make you look like the callous, heartless, abuser that you are. If you’re having trouble figuring out if you might “accidently” be playing dumb, try replacing the crime with murder and repeat the phrases. If it seems like you “accidentally” killed someone, then you’re probably on the wrong track.

STEP 4
Acknowledging the Damage You’ve Done:
While it’s tempting to skip over this one (other people’s feelings. Ew. Gross.) It is vital to include acknowledgement of the fall out in your apology. This can be done with easy statements like, “I recognize that I have forever and unequivocally physically, emotionally, socially, and spiritually hurt _______ with my inhuman actions and forever changed their ability to interact with, trust, and be around other people.” Example statement of what not to do could look something like this: “I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men.” Remember, rape can lead to serious mental and physical damage including but not limited to: PTSD, autoimmune disorders, depression, dysautonomia, weight gain or loss, suicidality, self harm, eating disorders, panic attacks, flash backs, night terrors, agoraphobia, and other serious life long conditions that the abused will have to spend the rest of their life dealing with, paying for, and attempting to explain to doctors, family members, partners, children, insurers, and other medical professionals who will probably feel like they are “over reacting,” “not strong enough,” or “just looking for attention.” The list above does not include the social, spiritual, or professional ramifications which may include: being passed over for work, loosing friends, family, and acquaintances who don’t want to believe you, loss of faith in humanity and the idea of a benevolent god or gods, disenchantment with the political and social and legal systems and processes, inability to find joy in everyday tasks, work, life, etc.

STEP 5
Don’t Brag:
While it’s tempting to use all of your newfound attention to show off your accomplishments, stay away from lists of movies, TV shows, specials, works of art or music, comedy, personal achievements, medals of honor, past or future service or [philanthropy](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/05/us/statement-from-harvey-weinstein.html), or any other accomplishment that might take attention away from your apology or remind your readers of how awesome you are. While advertising campaigns are effective, they are better left outside of apologies for felonies.

STEP 6
Apologize Sincerely:
This is the most important part of an apology and can also be the trickiest one for people used to the old rhetoric! In order to apologize sincerely it is best to be specific. Instead of listing the people in your life you’ve hurt such as your family, your fans, your recent or upcoming projects, your managers or producers, etc. It is important to apologize personally to the person you’ve abused by name unless that person hasn’t outed themselves yet, and then it would be more appropriate to send them your apology personally rather than in a blanket statement. That might look something like this “(Name of abused) I am sorry for: (Select all that apply) sexually abusing/raping/groping/drugging/assaulting/harassing/stalking/slandering/lying/dismissing/attacking/victim blaming/shaming/gas lighting/molesting you. What I did is wrong and there is no excuse for it. My apology does not absolve me of any wrong doing, any hurt I have caused you or the people you love, or in anyway require or request forgiveness for the horrific acts I’ve done.” 

STEP 7
What to Do Next:
Once you’ve shown your statement to the world, and comforted yourself in the knowledge that out of [1000](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system)  rapes only 6 rapists are incarcerated you might be tempted to breathe a sigh of relief and resume your life as if nothing happened. But before you do that, it’s important to educate yourself, get help, and turn your life around. While this seems exhausting, without it your apology is worthless. The more you admit to yourself that you are in the wrong, the less likely you are to attempt to commit another act of sexual violence so you won’t have to write a pesky statement again! The good news is, that unlike the people you’ve abused, you can enjoy your own process of self-discovery without fear of repercussions. In fact, if you pursue therapy, give to organizations that support people who have been sexually assaulted and abused, and set up a fund to cover the medical and therapy costs of those you’ve abused you come out looking like a hero! Don’t forget, if all else fails, take some time out of the limelight and try not to think of the people whose lives you’ve ruined forever, and before you know it, it will all be over.


Note: While this post was written directly in response to the dozens of men who are attempting to apologize for inhuman acts, it is important to note that people of all sexes can also be abusers.",13Nov2017,0

13,"I’m 20 years old and I have social anxiety and depression.

I’ve had them since I was 17 because of some friends and teachers that I foolishly trusted. I can never forgive them and I’ve stopped hanging out with my high school friends because they remind me of those people and it is still triggering for me. 

Those were some very traumatic few months of my life. People I trusted turned backs on me, crossed many lines, threatened me, forced me, humiliated me, and isolated me from everything. At that point, I felt that nobody would listen to me even if I️ tried. 

I didn’t want to go to school anymore. I tried to stay home as much as possible. I stopped hanging out with friends. I didn’t socialize. I slept and stared blankly through classes.  Occasionally smiled pretending everything was okay. I stopped talking to my family. Most my time was spent sleeping because that would be the only way I would feel nothing.

It wasn’t too long before I began blaming myself. I became suicidal. I made several plans to kill myself. I knew where the gun was kept, the fastest way to bleed out, how to tie a noose, and such. In the end the one thing that kept me alive was my family. I  didn’t want my family to take on the burden of my death. I didn’t want to be selfish by just ending my life. 

I convinced my parents to let me transfer schools for my senior year. I held everything in and tried my best to make it through the rest of the year. It was really hard. Nothing was better. If anything everything became worse and worse, but I only looked forward to the day I would move away from this hell. 

I went to a different school and met new people. Trying to act cool and happy was really hard. I had trouble trusting my new friends and frequently doubted if they were really my friends. I could never be sure. And this still happens today. While most days are good, the bad days consist of anxiety attacks and paranoia. It’s scary knowing that I can’t control what my brain or body does: 

I can’t control my thoughts, my face feels numb, my heart starts racing, it gets hard to focus my eyes, it’s hard to breathe, and I feel nauseated. 

Everything feels so unfair, so I cry. Sometimes I can figure out what triggered me. Sometimes not. It’s all extremely emotionally and physically exhausting. My hatred towards those people grows each time I experience an anxiety attack. I don’t think I will ever be able to forgive them. 

Two months ago, I was in a semi-big car accident. Since then, I can’t remember many of the details of what happened during those horrible months and I am kind of relieved and also not. I used to remember every little thing of what those people did and said to me and now I don’t, but I. still remember those same disgusting feelings just like it was yesterday. It’s gotten a little blurry but I still have the same triggering points and same amount of anxiety attacks as before. 

I don’t know when all this will stop, if ever. It’s infuriating knowing that those people probably have never looked back or thought about how much damage their actions caused on a single person. ",13Nov2017,1
14,"Today I was using the botcheck.me chrome extension while browsing through tweets for the hashtag about boycotting Keurig. In doing so I came across a huge number of vehemently pro-Trump twitter accounts that botcheck.me reports as most likely being bots. They all retweet each other and occasionally promote each other others' accounts. 

The weird thing about these accounts is that they are all wearing poorly photoshopped santa hats in their profile pictures. Many of them appear to be using the same source image for their santa hat.

The only other person I can find online who has noticed this as well is somebody who tweeted it about it just 18 hours ago.

Earlier today I stupidly left a nonstick pot boiling water and all the water evaporated and i burned the nonstick coating and had to throw it away. I ventilated the house, but i forgot to ventilate my upstairs room.

I didn't crack a window or nothing. Naturally, I assumed if I had CO in the room, my CO detector would go off... but it turns out i have none. My dad just told me the things in my room are only smoke detectors. 

I was feeling super delirious and nauseous after having sat in my room all day. seriously. I woke up two hours later seeing patterns on the ceiling. With a bit of mild paranoia too.  I dunno why, but the thought of opening the window was kinda freaky. So i was hesitant. 

I'm still in this room but with two windows wide open. I don't wanna catch a cold so ill try sleeping somewhere else. ",13Nov2017,6

19,"So, I'm a trans girl who started transition in senior year of high school. I'm now a freshman in college. 1 year hormones... I pass pretty well as a girl, a cute one at that, straight guys hit on me a lot.

However even after 2 years of transition and estrogen I still have recurring fantasies of what it would've been like to be a successful handsome man who slays pussy, or a ""Chad"" as they say. I remember being a freshman in high school in marching band during football games, seeing those big popular football players and thinking about what it would be like to be one of them.

I always heard those muscular varsity football players live like kings/celebrities. Girls ask them out. They go to saturday parties after football games where they bang the hot cheerleaders. Pounding pussy regularly.

However, the reason I pass so well as a small cute girl now, 115 lbs and 5' 7"" and quite small and skinny, is because I had low testosterone and delayed puberty/growth, which probably stopped me from ever getting into football. I sometimes playfully regret that I never got to be the Chad high school football player I could've been. Just like the linebacker builds that jokingly regret they never got to be the petite little girls they could've been.

Maybe I'm a detransition case waiting to happen. Honestly, if I had a button that would instantly turn me into a big handsome muscular Chad that attracts girls, I would have to think long and hard about if I want to press it or not. If I really really wanted to I could turn myself into a chad over the next year or 2, but it's irreversible. I'm scared to quit estrogen. Which would allow my testosterone to return, so I'd grow the beard and muscles and stuff. Meanwhile I will continue to take estrogen and be a cute girl.",13Nov2017,1
20,"It's odd, I've started seeing myself externally (in third person) more and more as I review the footage from my home security camera and I notice I just stare at the ground. My neck is bent weird and looking down. I wonder if this projects like ""mopiness"" depression, I should stare people in the eyes, hold their faces with both my hands and lock eyes moving in closer until our teeth grind against each other.

I hope I can change this, maybe I don't always stare at the ground, I generally do avoid people though and am a pushover. Thankfully I'm genetically well built but still, the mindset is bad. Also as soon as I make eye contact I usually look away like ""Oh fuck"" I'm sorry ahh well going to pull a rainman and start hitting myself in the face while I scream.

edit:

Kind of funny too ""home security"" what will somebody do if they actually broke into my apartment, see the camera system, take it down, I have the files uploaded to the cloud. Go to the police ""Here are some photos please help me"" okay we'll just take our quantum super computers and take your somewhat blurry photos and we'll figure it out who it is.

Everytime I post anywhere I get downvoted and the most unessacary comments on my posts. It’s annoying because it’s like I can’t even relate to people who have the same interest as me without them trying to exclude me from it.

I don’t really relate to too many people irl but once I️ truly understood reddit I was excited to contribute instead of just lurking, to actually be apart of the communities. But people literally refuse to let me while everyone else gets decent comments and upvotes.

32,"I always had anxiety problems near people, I have a hard time talking to people I don't know, and I dread the thought of being with someone else alone in a social situation (like, even sitting at the car. I hate being with someone while I'm driving). 

I have a girlfriend now. I never had one before, and it's hard. In fact, it might be the most mentally tasking thing I've ever had. My anxiety near her spikes to uncontrollable levels.

When I'm alone with her I'm always trying to be funny, be smart, be cool, whatever. When I text her I fear that she won't get my jokes, and if she takes time to reply I start seeing things negatively. She could tell me she loves me 10 times a day and I'd still believe that she doesn't care about me. I hate seeing her with other men (just talking to them), and I never bring her to my hangouts with friends because I'm constantly afraid of her seeing someone else as cooler, funnier, and better. In fact, deep inside I believe that almost any man in this planet has the potential to impress her more, and make me look like a loser near her.


So yes this is mentally tasking. Texting her, or talking with her on the phone, or being alone with her is very hard on me mentally. And it's not like I don't like her, I love her, that's why I suffer through it, but I want to enjoy this. I've read things like ""you should trust her, she chose you!"", But while this is true I feel like there's something deeper to solve here. I'm pretty tired of living like I have to prove something, and being dependent on her replies and reactions to me. Like, I could feel great if she tells my I'm funny or she loves me, but an hour later see a random dude make her laugh (like, a friend of her or something) and go into a depressed state where I think she likes everyone else more than me. And I hate living this way . But I'm not sure exactly why it's happening. I knew this girl for like 10 months and only after we were together all those things started happening.",13Nov2017,4

But I'm starting to make friends here. I even got invited to a party last weekend!

It's tough to insinuate yourself into existing social circles, though. People are set in their routines and they don't think to invite the new person at first. It will take time. I just have to stay positive and keep trying.

38,"In my now 12-14 years of work experience [it's hard to keep track trust me] 

I've worked retail , on every level except cashier, janitor, stock , management ,back of house. 
I've also worked corporate, general office, district assistant manager. you get the point 

I would like to start this with something a bit different then most , I would like to start this by Thanking all the cashiers out there. Seriously Thank you , leave a comment about your worst experience as one in comments section please. 

Recently I have been working for a certain entertainment store , spoiler it's not adult entertainment. 
This business has implemented a new system for it's stock management , The new system is touchy as all hell and crashes itself pretty frequently. The system also manages all orders that are being shipped out to customers from the stores. 

Now my main job , is managing those orders and reporting issues with the system and fixing them if possible. Along side helping customers, stocking the store and straightening it. 
Did i mention the new system lacks features the old system has so we have to use both old and new and make sure not to try do any new system processes on the old system and vice versa? 

So of course on a average day , the new system crashes while in use causing errors that have to be fixed through the old system. tie it in with all other things and you'd get stressed out pretty easily so I won't even gripe about my physical limitations at this point. 
I'm employed by the company not the store however my work directly effects the stores numbers and the store manager still out ranks me. So I'm stuck with two bosses both have the power to fire me and one out ranks the other.

So on a good day the systems are the only thing giving me trouble , What makes this such a lovely nightmare is that when it gives me 'enough' trouble , I get chewed out by 'both' of my bosses. The company won't give me access to the full system to fix it's basic programing errors and they won't let me or the store just use the old system.  

So my choices are : 
1.Work with both systems and get chewed out
2.Work with one system and hope / pray it keeps it's shit together
3.Try to fix the systems to work together in sync , taking up time and get chewed out .
or 4. Do my job the hellish way they have it , and get chewed out for the system failing. 

As to why I don't leave , 
1. I'm a tech school student , so im a few k in debt after sustaining a injury making me unsuitable for my career path. 
2. Believe it or not the staff at the store are beyond amazing to work with so when store manager gets on my case it hardly bothers me.
3. did I mention I'm a few grand in debt. from trying to get into a career. 

Some background : 

In all my experience there is still one place I'd never go back to and will tell people to avoid till the day i die , The big W. No full names but you can feel free to guess . 

I've worked for a lot of big retail companies on the eastern shores of the US. 
I've worked for two big name game developer companies , as a office pleeb, don't get jumpy trust me my names not gonna be in your games &gt;.&gt; far as i know anyway
And I have worked for a few come and gone companies at store and in office.  

If you have read this far and want to know why i respect cashiers so much having never worked that position . It's because I have seen what they have to put up with and some of the things I have personally witnessed would have been responded to in a way that I am 100% certain would have found me in jail.

I will say one last thing though , I honestly think 'the big W' should be held accountable for all ... or at least more of the on site deaths that occur every year or so. within in my time working for them three co-workers died on site via self-termination. ",13Nov2017,2

43,"So, I started seeing this girl about a week ago. I didn't really think much of her at first until she mentioned a comment about it sounding like the performer crapping their pants (a bridesmaids movie reference.) Most girls I date seem kind of boring, but she was really fun. The night kind of ended on a weird note when this married guy started asking questions to us about how we met while we were at a bar. She mentioned she liked me because I seemed put together and she was tired of dating jerks. Some guy was rolling down a fill, and she said she wouldn't do it because she didn't want to get her top dirty, he made a comment that she could take her top off. He then mentioned she will let me hit it in 3 weeks. We left shortly after. She still seemed interested in me. I texted her about going to this festival, and she mentioned she would rather have me join her on a volunteer thing or a road trip. We made plans to hang out the following weekend.

She didn't respond much over text. On Wednesday, I have a trivia group, and she mentioned she will bring her friends and compete against my team. I told her she was more than welcome to, and she ended up coming a bit late. Friends were joking she was on another date, which would make sense. She got along with my friends, and through some banter she implied I really liked her. She would text me but not during work (shes a teacher) and not between 7-9pm (i assumed dates.) 
Saturday rolls around and I pick her up for our date. We go to a restaurant and order a bottle of wine.  She mentions she actually matched with one of my friends before on an online dating app, but never went out with him. I laughed and mentioned it wasn't that big a deal, and that guy tried to set me up with this other girl he dated. She inquired, and I mentioned it was the girl in the trivia group. She asked why he would set me up with her, and I said because we banter a bit. She asked why I didn't date her, and I mentioned how she referenced three ways with actors (she's an actor.) She said, ""well you might still have a shot."" Then we got into online dating. I mentioned if I don't feel chemistry I just tell them I would rather be friends. She said thats better than her, she ghosts them. She then mentioned it would be weird to stay friends. I mentioned there were only 2 girls I tried to stay friends with, and its a mentality that I tried adopting because my ex still talked to her ex's and it made me uncomfortable. She mentioned shady is shady. Later on int the night, we were talking about our family, and as she was inquiring about my family I mentioned half of them pretty much joined a cult, so I'm not really religious. I tried to clarify it by stating they are just extreme christian fundamentalist, who follow a prophet on youtube, and think the world is going to end so they stopped talking to us.  We were at a arcade bar, and I was getting kind of tired (we met at 5pm, started drinking early, and it was 11pm.) I mentioned leaving and she kept asking about when they closed which was 1am. I drop her off home, and as she's about to exit I say ""so would you..."" she finished saying ""you wanna kiss me."" Se she leans in for a kiss and we make out for about 30 seconds. She leaves, but she was smiling. I get home elated. I look at her online dating profile because I wanted to see her face, but noticed she added some new pics. Then it kind of struck me that she's still looking. The next day I tried to make plans for another date, and after a little back and forth said that would be fun but she's going to be busy this week because of school. The fact that she took about an hour to respond to each message on the last date, I feel like she's ghosting me. It hurts more than I thought it would after only 3 dates. ",13Nov2017,7
44,"My parents always seemed happy together, up until a few months ago when my second sibling went to college and now it's just me and my parents. My mom is sleeping in a different room (she claims it's so that she can respond to texts from my sisters without bothering dad but that's a really weird reason), she bought and is reading a book called ""The Secret to Facing the World by Yourself"" or something like that, and my dad has been acting more and more irritable, often becoming agitated if someone asks him a simple question. My mom has expressed her exasperation with his recent attitude multiple times. Should I be concerned? Should I talk to them?",13Nov2017,24
45,"Maybe this is a poor person's thought/mindset or something

I'm in a good place I mean it's not great, but I'm not homeless, have internet access, I can learn anything I want to.

It takes time, I just need patience, see incremental steps.

Relax and be in the moment. Be grateful to exist even if just a blip in the universal time scale.",13Nov2017,9
47,"I dont...fully hate myself, just sort of a low key thing that never goes away. Usually I can ignore it but sometimes I cant.

Its been getting worse, Ive been drinking more to cope with it.

I dont have a reason to be shitty to myself, but here I am doing it. I ant it to stop, because I actually have a damn good life. I just need to convince a part of my brain to shut up and enjoy things.",13Nov2017,4

It feels like I'm cursed. I don't like most people. At the place where I work out of a hundred there're barely ten that I lukewarmly like, and no one I like for real. I can't influence that, just find most people boring.    
    
And yet there're people in the world I find fun. I can barely count twenty in all of my life, but they exist, and I know it. I miss their company really badly. And they just don't care.     
    
I mean, it feels like the most dishonest thing in the world. All I've ever wanted was to not feel alone, to talk really deeply, to connect, to be understood. I'm not pretty, I'm not that smart, but it feels like my brains just work in a rarely weird way, and that should evoke sympathy from like-minded people, right? Well, no. All of them, literally all of them but one just began ignoring me at some point or didn't say anything at all when I wrote them.     
    
I mean, you find someone, say, on a dating site, and you think, woah, we're really gonna click, there's literally no choice. I can do weird jokes, you can do weird jokes, we share more than three hundred interests, we're made for each other. And no. The qualities required are something that I don't possess.  Something is wrong. Something more is needed.   
    
And yet a lot of people seem to like me on that dating site. It's just ALL OF THEM seem boring.    
    
I realize I sound like an entitled idiot. Sure, no one owes me anything. I'm not that perfect charismatic handsome stranger everybody dreams of. Gotta live with it. But why don't the subsets of people I like and people who like me intersect, at least a little?    
    
It feels a bit as if it doesn't happen because it's important. It's literally the most important thing in the world for me right now, I'm sick and tired of being lonely, I want *someone*, but of course a special someone. And the best I get is lukewarm attraction and remote friendliness.    
    
And idk what I could change. I don't break rules, I respect everybody's place on this planet, even of those I actively dislike. I'm not confrontational. I'm sane. It's my word against this bloody post, but I am sane. I'd gladly find something to like in most people, but it feels like they're so alien there's literally no common ground. And I can't change my attitude. And I don't know what to do, really, because everything just slowly gets worse and worse, and even escapism no longer helps. And it sucks, really-really does. Yep.

54,"All my parents do is watch TV. From the minute they get home from work until they go to bed. On their days off they spend them in front of the TV. And they don't do anything else. They don't have any hobbies, they don't go on dates, they don't listen to music, they barely clean, they don't even cook dinner. It's to the point where I can't be downstairs once they get home because they turn on the TV right away. I can't cook in the kitchen or listen to music or be downstairs at all unless I want to listen to the TV. It's such a negative environment and I'm so sick of it. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could inspire them to do something else? I live with them and it'd be nice to be able to share the space.",13Nov2017,5
