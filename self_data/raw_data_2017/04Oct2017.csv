0,"Sorry if this is long, I just need to vent a little. 
Maybe if I put it into words I can make more sense of all this.

In the last few weeks I’ve had a few issues with myself. 
I’ve always been quite mellow, I’ve never been one to share my feelings or show much excitement. I keep almost all of my feelings to myself and I don’t know why, I’ve always been like that and I liked it. 

Recently I’ve been through a lot, I found out I have a tumour in my breast that is benign luckily but I need an operation to get it out, my grandmother has an incurable cancer and my partner of five years broke up with me just last week. So I’ve just moved back in with my parents.

But my issues started in July. 

I have had problems containing my feelings, I’m sad a lot, I cry uncontrollably for no reason and I don’t know if this has anything to do with anything but when I’m on my own or trying to get some sleep I hear voices talking to me, it’s never anything bad. It’s often a just a mans voice yelling, “hey!” Or asking what I’m doing. Once I heard a woman and a man taking to each other but the conversation started mid way through and I didn’t know what they were talking about but all of it was in my head, my ex couldn’t hear anything when I asked him about it.

I’ve been feeling quite erratic and I’ve been getting angry and annoyed or weirdly overjoyed by nothing, these feelings come in waves. I’ve been talking a lot, rambling on about stuff that is really not important and half of it doesn’t make sense and it’s worrying my Mum. I can’t control what I’m feeling anymore and it’s scaring me. I’m so used to being completely neutral about everything but now I’m happy one second then I’m upset and I have no idea what’s going on. 

I’ve also began to stutter when I talk, and I can’t get half of my words out and it makes me panic and I have to lie down on the floor often in a ball to settle myself or sit down and tuck my head between my knees.

I think I should see a doctor but I’m terrified that they’ll say I’m broken and need help. I’ve never needed anyone else’s help with anything.. I’ve always been very independent and now something is wrong and I can’t deal with it myself. 

I don’t think I’d ever do something to hurt myself or anyone else but at the same time I had my first ever thought that if I was to die all of a sudden all my feelings would go away and there would be nothing. I miss feeling nothing but I definitely 100% don’t want to die haha unless I’m old and get to the point of having some poor nurse changing my bum every day... because that’s no way to live! 

But yeah, I think that’s it.
My parents are getting a new puppy today so let’s just hope a new fur baby in the family will get my mind off all my crazy shit. 


tl;dr: I think I’m losing my mind but we’re getting a puppy today so that should be fun. ",04Oct2017,1
1,"Im kind of lost on what to do at this point. Ive never been able to find happiness which has been manageable until now. Depression hasn't been a huge problem for me ive always been able to manage it and work through it and try to stay positive about my life, I kept telling myself you still can do something and make it better. But at this point its just becoming to much. Im 29 years old and recently moved back into my parents basement after a failed relationship with someone that i thought i was going to spend my life with. I just found out my grandmother has stage 4 cancer on saturday, and my mom told me today that she wants a divorce from my dad. I dont know how much more i can take. I feel like my life is in ruins and I have no desire to try anymore. I cant think if much that brings me happiness besides my dog, and I have a harder and harder time actually caring about anyone else let alone myself. I tried to talk to a friends about it but they just say the standard ""itll get better, just push through"" shit that doesnt help.

On top of just always hating myself I come here to vent and I cant help but just feel like an idiot when i go to the depression page and see people that are worse than me and that just makes me feel like shit thinking my life is worse than theirs. I feel like i cant relate to anyone about it or talk to anyone that understands how i feel. I know that i could be worse off but my brain just wont work right and let me find positive things to focus on. I wish i could just change how i am and make everything better. ",04Oct2017,1
2,"So I left this group of people I've been friends with on and off for years, these guys were my main friends in late highschool and early college and were basically my entire social circle. I was friends with them for 3-4 years give or take. I left because I felt like they didn't respect me enough after a lot of things happened, such as one of them went on this extremely degrading rant full of profanity against me in a group chat we were all in, they also wouldn't really take any of my personal problems seriously and constantly made fun of me for having anxiety/depression, etc. I also just never had fun around them, I hated hanging out with them and interacting with them was a chore at most times. 

But at the same time, they were kind of all I had socially. I've found a few other people since breaking it off with them, but I still feel a void that won't close. Also I was accidentally readded to a chat they were all in tonight and before I left, I saw that they were still talking shit about me *months* after I stopped talking to them. It doesn't feel right or natural that people I trusted and invested so much in emotionally and socially would just start treating me like this.  I feel like it's my fault even though I know intellectually it never was. Is this some kind of crazy, unusual thing? Does anyone know of somebody else having a situation where they had to leave close, long-term friends because of a breakdown of trust and respect like what I described? ",04Oct2017,1

There's this one kid who is a friend of my best friend (who also isn't truly my friend) who long story short finds it funny to put me down every day. And there have been times I've been walking behind him and just imagine grabbing his shoulder with one hand and snapping grabbing his chin with the other and snap his neck. I've thought about this several times.

There is also this one girl who pretended to be my friend over text/sc (we would text hours a day (3-4) every day and it was fun) (who I thought was my only actual friend) and then one day just stopped, like disappeared. And I texted her asking what happened and I was distraught because I thought I did something bad to her to make her quit and made up some excuse, and the only reason why she gave me an explanation was because I said I was going to ask her in first period if she didn't tell me and that'd be awkward because people will be there and she didn't want to do that, and acted as if her half- not true explanation was doing me a favor. (No, she didn't like me and I didn't like her, trust me on this one) Then I still visualize/think about shooting her in different scenarios.

Now of course I know I would never shoot anyone or hurt anyone even, but I don't know if everyone does it? Like it's not an urge, I am not fighting back an urge from doing it, I just visualize me doing it. ",04Oct2017,1

6,"So for some details I am a junior psychology student at a university.

I don't want to say it is 'wrong' exactly because it's less a matter of fact than a way of conceptualizing the facts, but I think the professor has conceptualized it poorly and it should be changed.

13,"I'm in college, first semester. Engineering. In terms of educational substance, I love it. But I have this nagging feeling that those who go to this aren't very good people. I'll explain. If you don't want to read the background, fast forward to the third paragraph.
    
**BACKGROUND:**

When I was in highschool, I took all science and math courses. Did pretty good reaching later years, but math was always a struggle for me. Grade 10 math I got lazy and didn't click with the teacher and I failed it, the only course I've ever failed, then took again and passed in summerschool with flying colors. Wasted grade 11 by taking a lower tier math course that wasn't the prerequisite to calculus, by a recommendation by a misguided, guidence counselor. Needed calc for uni. Graduated. Victory lap, minus the victory. 

Took grade 11 prerequisite for calc in summerschool, full course. Passed with flying colors. Took the second prerequisite to calc, passed with a 50. Did not click with the teacher, in addition to his terrible teaching style. Had the same teacher for calc. Could barely keep up as my knowledge in the fundamentals was weak. Ended up dropping out and applying to college. Got in no problem since I took all high tier courses. Fast forward to now, in college and flourishing. 

**PRESENT:**

When I look back on highschool, one of the greatest things I remember was how great everyone in my high tier classes were. Everyone was either academically serious, or semi-serious, but all had a passion for science and learning. I remember fondly my highschool classmates. But they all went to university. I was seperated from them and went to college, and although I am doing engineering, it feels no where near the same. No enthusiasm, just passive. People call me smart now, but it makes me feel awful because I was nowhere near the smartest in highschool. I don't feel empowered by the compliment, I feel like I threw away my potential from a mistake I made over 3 years ago. I enjoy being able to help others with their classes since it is rewarding to see them finally understand and it also helps me study. Nevertheless, I just can't shake this feeling that these are the people who don't have any passion for their studies, but are just passive, apathetic, and uninspired people who never cared in the first place. I don't feel the eagerness or zeal towards science I once experienced and shared and it really hurts to think about. Is it any different in University?",04Oct2017,7
14,"I was sad so I was browsing Buzzfeed-style websites to make myself feel better and found an article of funny halloween costumes. One of them was a $119 sexy Alexander Hamilton costume... and I bought it... 

I have never worn a sexy costume before and I didn't even do a costume last year because I was at a tournament so I don't know what I was thinking. I'm kind of excited for it though? I just really don't know how to feel about my purchasing choices and my choices as a human being right now :P",04Oct2017,14
16,"I feel this has been more of a thing in the last... Three months, and I'm not sure how other's feel about this.
It's more ... ""Meta"", being discussion on the state of subs themselves, but I feel that /r/restofthefuckingowl and /r/CrappyDesign have more and more posts that don't really qualify, or only just barely do so.

For the latter, I feel that more recent posts
- Overlap with other subs (/r/softwaregore /r/youhadonejob)
- The posts don't have any obvious, poorly designed things. Bad design may mean something like a mug with a handle you can't even fit a hand through (maybe), or a locker door blocked by a handrail etc, in terms of buildings
- This final point itself is not really a complaint, but some posts where something seems... ""Mildly sexual"" (a fishing company called MasterBait, or a grim reaper costume with a child sitting on it in a particular way...), it *is amusing* to have somebody pipe up and question if it was intended....

For the former, I feel more recent posts have instructions that are understandable - they don't articulate *every* single thing, but they still have the steps or waypoints needed. /r/restofthefuckingowl was meant for instruction sets that don't help - that breeze through the steps in between, but it feels there are less of those nowadays.

Maybe this belongs in /r/TheoryOfReddit , where I do sometimes wonder whether it's another sub ranting on conspiracies, but I don't think my post really has enough hypothesises or theories, it's more of a complaint. Maybe some people would like to chip in their two cents worth?

(Also, I swear tonnes of subs say that they are *""a curated discussion space""*, and that *""we won't just let the votes decide""*, but fewer seem to take this to heart, which does seem to really defeat those statements, more so the second)

17,"So, this is a long story and I'm not even expecting anyone to read it, but I need to get everything in writing so here it goes. Sorry if it feels like I'm rambling or my english isn't very good. Not my first language and I'm a little drunk. Also, this is kind of a rant to myself so whatever.

I'm 24 years old, about to graduate college. I started 5 years ago a computer science career. I was a stereotype. Smart, a little lazy, socially awkward and a bit of a loser, no history with girls whatsoever, but with a good group of friends. So I start college in my home city, where I still live with my parents, most people here do, and everything is going fine. After a couple of years I start failing some classes, start losing interest and things like that. I was thinking of changing degrees but I thought I had already invested a lot of time and money on it so I might as well finish my degree. I keep failing classes but by an act of god I somehow got a summer intership at a major software company in the US (My country is south from there, you know what I mean). 

So this is an amazing opportunity and I'm getting paid a shit ton of money, even more compared to my peers. So naturally, being how I am, I fuck up the internship and don't get an offer for a job, which most people do. I was already planning my life based on that but it ended up fucking with me and I changed everything. The good thing is the recruiter told me I could apply again and I'd at least get an interview, a year later.

Next semester after this, I fail half my classes, I was thinking of going for a semester abroad but end up not doing it because of my failed classes, and I have to take another semester after summer to make up for everything. At this point I meet a girl. She is cool, funny, pretty, intelligent. She's amazing, and we start dating and very fast we end up hooking up. This was the first fuck up. Before sleeping together we had a talk and I told her I was a virgin and she told me she wasn't. I obviously didn't ask more but it kind of bummed me out a little. I know there's nothing wrong with it but still, it would have been nice if we had been each other's firsts. Anyway, one night after we were both very drunk and I thought this was the time to do it so we did it. It was extremely underwhelming since I was very drunk and she was too (we were both conscious and we had talked about it before) but still, not the best first time. After this we continued dating and we were boyfriend and girlfriend, everything was going great.

Now it's about to be summer and I have no plans. I have the money from the internship, I have 3 months free, and my gf was going to europe for a month for a summer class. Gues what I do? I decide to pay for a super expensive summer course in the states for a class I have no interest in a super expensive city just because it was near the place I had been last year because I thought that's what I had to do get back the job I thought I wanted. A friend from school told me he was going and I just thought it would be a good idea, I didn't even research what else I could do. After a couple of weeks I realized the mistake I made and got really depressed because I was wasting my money in a course I didn't want, in a city I didn't liked, living in an awful house, with people I didn't like. I could have been traveling in europe with my girlfriend, going to great places and spending way less money on everything, but I'm an idiot.

After the summer ended and I came back I realized I had been living my life all wrong, doing things because they were easy and because people would suggest them. Everything I have done was because someone told ""man this would be cool"" and I'd be like ""yeaaah"". Whenever I wanted to do something I'd need someone else to do it with me, or someone to organize and plan something and I'd tag along. I started to think what I really wanted and I got kind of tripped about what I'm doing with my life. This semester I decided to work on myself and I put some goals for myself, the main one was getting the job back. I got an interview with the company I did the internship, got to the final round, and fucked it up. This was my goal for more than a year and I just fucked up the interview. I just didn't study enough. Somehow ended up thinking that my girlfriend was holding me back because I didn't know what I want and I was confused about everything. After two months I haven't done shit for my goals. Still lazy, still the same.  And for whatever dumb reason, I broke up with my girlfriend. Also, a few weeks earlier I kind of broke contact with my friends because I realize I hate most of them. 

Here comes a weird part of the story. I went to a bar with some guys I know, and at the bar I lose them. So I'm wandering around and I talk to a girl and a guy starts fucking yelling at me that I shouldn't talk to her. So he starts getting in my face and I yell back at him shit, and suddenly he says ""oh shit, I know who you are! I recognize your ugly face. I fucked your girlfriend. I fucked your girlfriend! HAHAH"". It was fucking insane but I thought he was talking shit so I just said some shit to him and he hit me in the face, which I didn't respond to. After a couple of days I ask a guy who went with me to the bar who that guy was and it turns out he's my gf (or ex)'s ex. So that shit he yelled was true. Now I feel like such a fucking loser and I can't get that out of my head. It's awful.

So now I'm feeling like shit, living with my parents, graduating with a major I don't like after five years, without a job or money, very little experience working, without my friends, whithout my girlfriend who I now miss a lot, and without knowing what I want to do, and with the realization I'm a fucking pussy. A year ago I was on top of the world. I was about to make 100k in the best city in the world at a great company with awesome people, and I lost everything. Because I fuck everything up.",04Oct2017,3

I don't grieve for those I lost; I don't grieve differetly, because I, apparently, don't fucking grieve -- I get bitter.



and tired. my God, how I just want sleep -- normal sleep. Not the toss-and-turn-for-four-fucking-hours, pillow-throwing, rage-inducing sleep. Not the kind of sleep that eventually ends with laying in bed until the afternoon, only to ""wake up"" tired and numb. The kind of tired that feeds my ever-growing spirit of bitterness that has taken ahold and sunk its filthy fucking claws in the nape of my neck, tearing, shredding, and pulling in every direction I don't want it to. A parasite that has tainted my world. Everything around me is tasteless, pointless. That which I used to enjoy has become an anxiety-inducing chore, and to engage is to panic.



I used to be so happy, so inspired, and full of dreams. I was able, fit, young, attractive, smart, and capable. The irony is I still am those things, at least that's what people tell me. To them, I have everything I could (or should?) ever want, and the world is my oyster -- I just don't fucking care.

I still love, and I still try. I have to hope that things will get better. I have to stage-five my life, but everything is covered in an impenetrable fog - toxic and blinding, and I don't want to accept that.

I miss the old me.

24,"I know there are a lot of people who hates the process of buying a car. I understand – I used to be the same way. Over time, things changed, though. I love how car salesmen bend over backwards to get you to buy. Where else can you go, make demands, and have others search frantically to find what you want? The car market is extremely oversupplied with nowhere near enough demand to meet it, so you can basically get whatever you want.

Yeah, there’s the whole nonstop pressure selling tactics and upselling. Dealerships and car lots love the art of salesmanship like few other places and they have a hundred tactics to get you to buy/upgrade.

But there’s an easy way around it: Keep in mind what you want and be ready to say ‘no, thank you’. It may sound hard, but take it from a guy who is normally meek/shy and avoids confrontation like the plague, it is easy. Just know what you want, be polite, and say 'no, thank you' if it doesn't fit your desire.

I recently bought a car from a dealership. Initially, I made an offer over email and got a reply asking me for contact info. Normally, I would have ignored them knowing they wanted me to come in, but, on a whim, I gave it to them. Of course, they did as I thought, and I accepted the challenge.

I walked in keeping in mind two things: The specific vehicle options I wanted and that I wanted the car to meet my budget out the door.

The car I was looking at was sold and this was where the fun began. I told the salesman my budget and criteria and he, of course, said ‘yes’. He took me all around the lot trying out a bunch of cars trying to upsell me. No problem. If the car fit my criteria, I asked him if they could sell it to me for my budget out the door. If it fit my budget but not my criteria, I tell him that I simply don’t want any car that doesn’t fit the criteria.

This ring around the rosie game continued and they tried other methods. They (he and his manager) ask me to consider buying based on monthly payments instead of a final price; I insisted that the final price is how I do my budget and it is what I consider financially smart. They tried to get me to tack an extra thousand onto my budget and, eventually, even went as low as a few hundreds extra on one model that fit my criteria. I said ‘no, thank you’ to both and insisted on my originally stated budget.

At this point, they tried to bluff me by saying that they simply couldn’t do any better and apologized saying they don’t have any car that could fit my needs. They make the offer of a few hundreds extra on that one model again. I told them I would need a few days to think about it and that if I can’t do it, I may just keep my original car and wait a few months to a year for prices to go down (yeah, I wasn’t going to do that).

As I walked outside speaking to my salesman, guess what happened? The manager followed after me…and made me a new offer. The offer was exactly my budget out the door, which was 25% off the sticker price of the model. Deal!

For my last trick, I told them I was out of time (which was true, actually) so I’ll put a deposit down and come back tomorrow to sign paperwork. This put them in a hustle (salesmen *hate* potential sales leaving without being closed), so they offer to complete everything within an hour. I agreed and we all moved to do complete the process (with my part being to add the car to my insurance). I had everything signed, sealed, and ready to leave within an hour.

It ended up being the fastest car deal I ever did and the first to not only meet my expectations, but surpassed it. The car is actually far better than what I originally aimed for and I'm loving it.

So that is my story of how I learned to stop worrying and love going to car dealerships.",04Oct2017,37
