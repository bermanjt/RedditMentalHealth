4,"So, I used to be a huge Twitter-holic. It was terrible, I was basically the average lame college boy who tweeted everything it was a real problem. Flash forward 4 years I'm still lame as hell, out of college, and post too much on Reddit. 

So anyway I go on Twitter a few months back just to check and see that I had a new follower a few weeks back. I click on it, expecting it to be just some spam account. I'm about to click away and go watch porn when I realize the most recent tweet was ""&lt;My First and Last Name&gt; Has mental problems."" 

The plot thickens.

I start scrolling through this ladies posts. I'm seeing things like this...

""I'm looking for 'Dxxxxx Sxxxxxx' he owes me money.""

""Dxxxxxx Sxxxxxx owns a white Taurus and works at XXXXX Factory""

""Dxxxxxx Sxxxxx is divorced from Kxxxxxxx Wxxxxxx and has 2 kids""

Now, none of these things are about me as they are not true and the pictures show a fat balding man, I'm of course a svelte motherfucker so I'm not the same Dxxxxx Sxxxxxxx.

And of course to absolutely make this weird event weirder, this scary timeline attacking my namesake was peppered with little tidbits of ""I'm selling Avon, if you're interested let me know!"" Except she spelled Avon, ""Evon"" it took me a while to figure out she meant Avon. 

All in all, a really odd story I just felt like sharing. ",06Feb2017,0
5,"Hi Redditors,

Looking for some advice if you wouldn't mind. In the past I've been an avid reader of reddit and love it but never posted a thing. So this has been my first turn to come to for advice.

I have recently been given some bad news that has made me question what I want to do with the rest of my life. I haven't told my family yet, just waiting for the right time. I'm 24 and live in the UK with my family.

I've basically lived a very average life so far. I went through high school and college and then thought I'd try and earn some money. Took a 'temporary' administration job which I was going to do for a few months and save some money. Fast forward 5 years and I am still there with very little difference in my savings.

I've made plenty of mistakes which have made it hard to move on and kinda got stuck. It is one of if not the biggest regret I have.

I wish I did more. Hindsight is a great thing eh?

Anyways (sorry for the rant) I'm wondering what I should have on my bucket list? If you could chose 1 thing for your list what would it be and why?

So far the only thing I've got on mine is spending some quality time with my family which I will do. Just curious to hear what other people would do.

Hopefully I can add a couple more experiences to it.

Kind Regards.",06Feb2017,5

I seriously have no respect for people who know proper nutrition and yet forego it anyway. Especially when it comes to raising a kid. And know that I'm old enough to make my decisions I have to be the one in pain cause I have urges to eat all the time,and as a kid I was never told no. 

Especially when it comes down to trying to start exercising or dieting and having to hear your fat parents make jokes about it, like ""maybe it'll work this time"". They aren't bad parents in most other regards, but Jesus. Teach your kids proper nutrition.",06Feb2017,17

13,"I've heard instances where due to circumstances a person cannot watch the an episode of a show or a movie so they essentially shut off their social media and avoid reading about the topics to avoid spoilers; at least until they can catch up to it and then enjoy it at their pace. This is something that happens more and more in recent times with the availability of on-demand content and DVR or whatever.   If you miss a show you may delay it by like maybe an hour or a almost a week before the next show comes up. With movies, well some jerk would just post Episode 7 spoilers in a comment for a YouTube cooking channel. 

Doesn't really happen in sports I guess. There used to be a time when someone would set a recording to start for a game so they can watch it later that night- if you're a hardcore fan anyway. But now bringing in the whole modern times aspect, 4 different news apps I have all just announced the winners of the Super Bowl and I kind of wonder how funny that would be if they did the same and say like Empire Strikes Back and the next morning all the newspaper headlines across the nation was about Darth Vader being Luke's father. 

I know it's all different, just amusing to me. ",06Feb2017,2
17,"My husband and I just got home from a nice night out at a superbowl party. We got home at 11:45pm and were excited to just relax and snuggle up with our animals. We have a decent amount of pets.. A dog, cat, and some lizards. 
We walk through our door to our floor of the house we live in and it feels cold, but I just figured that was from the walk from the car. But before we ever leave the house for an extended period of time we turn the heat down to 72, so it stays warm for our animals. So I go to turn the heat up a few degrees to get it warm and, to my surprise, the heat is turned completely OFF! Before jumping to any conclusions. I double check with my husband if he remembers turning the heat off.. Of course he didn't. Why would we do that when we have animals in the house?! So that only leaves our upstairs neighbors... This is not the first time they've done this and I am so beyond frustrated and just pissed off..
They are so disrespectful, rude, and just inconsiderate! I can't take it! If I went up there and turned off their goddamn heat with their baby upstairs they would flip shit! These animals are our babies! They shouldn't be in a house with no heat on for hours! I feel so guilty for how long we were gone now.. We got home and it was fucking 65 degrees on our thermostat and that's just in the hallway. Our bedroom and the kitchen are always so much colder. Plus the draft that comes in from the living room window! Ugh! I don't understand how someone can think this is okay!!!! 
I'm trying really hard to not send them an angry message since its past midnight and I am a decent human being. I need to calm down and I know venting can help, so my apologies for the rant, but I'm about to snap on these assholes...

This is all just more motivation to work hard, make money, save up, and buy a goddamn house of our own. But until then I think I'm going to get a cover with a lock for our thermostat... ",06Feb2017,2

People around me never had bosses, my dad is a doctor as well as my mother, my uncle is a CEO of a medium sized company etc... Only my young cousins have bosses but I don't know them well. I feel like me, having a boss, is a dishonor to my family... ( yes it's a bit extreme I know ) it's like submitting yourself and your energy to another person, and that person doesn't give you back what you made worth of your time ( they sometimes do, but like I said, who prevents them from not doing so? )

I really do not hope I'll have a boss later, I intend to work through a PhD and do research at a Uni, sure the boss will be the owner of the Uni, but it'll feel like I'm my own boss and everything I do will be labeled under my name. Eventually, with enough money I've thought about starting my own company.

But yeah, overall I feel like finding a job instead of creating one feels like the easy way in life, and because you didn't choose to take risks, you get f***** over by your employers.

33,"I have a friend that i have known from the first day we went to school. We dropped contact when we went to secondary and then became friends again through a mutual friend.

He is the type of guy who will do anything for you the one you call when you need a hand. He is a damn good friend. But his viewpoints on the world are a little fucky.

I'll list some of the things that have been playing on my mind for a while:

* He voted for brexit because his gran relies on the NHS and we were told the money we saved from not paying into the EU would support the NHS

* When it came out that that money was not guaranteed to go to the NHS he confided in me to tell me he actually voted to leave because he was scared that the UK was going to turn into Syria with the amount of Muslims coming here.

* He wanted Donald Trump to be ""prime minister of america"" because women have never done a good job of it in the past and it would be nice to see a man fuck it up ""for a change"".

*  When questioned on the above he told me that he was happy the UK had not had a female PM. We currently have Theresa may as PM and Thatcher was a well known pm.

* A number of the shows we watch together have LGBT characters. He skips past the parts where they talk about their relationships because he doesn't think it's ok to have it on tv all the time.

* This has lead to a number of confusing conversations where he tries to ship two characters that he doesn't realise are gay. He also misses chunks of the show and then gets annoyed that they hadn't explained it when they had it was just in te section with the lesbians that he refused to watch

* As a group of friends we all hug goodbye we have done for a long time. He makes a purposeful effort if one of our friends gay brother has joined us to shake his hand because ""he doesn't want him to get the wrong idea"" 

* We have to watch tv shows at the same time either over facebook messenger or xbox live chat so he can ask questions as it goes along. This has lead to me watching a show twice often.

These are just a number of things he has done. but he makes some odd comments on a daily basis. I tried to ignore it but now some of these conversations have turned into me talking to him like he's 5 and i don't think thats a healthy relationship to have. 
 
Like I said though this guy has a heart of gold he was just brought up in a family that had some outdated views about the world around them.

This is going to come across as condescending because everyone has different view points but i feel the longer i allow him to act this way with me the more he will think it is acceptable in the real world. He has already started mentioning things like how he believes: 

&gt;""Muslims shouldn't be allowed to fly planes because their track record is shoddy.""

in public to which a small pause and a cricket from two miles away was heard. I laughed to make people think it was a joke but i know better... I just feel one day this is going to get and maybe me in trouble.

Right now, it works out just fine, I'm scoring unreasonably high grades, among the 4 or 5 best in our 200 people group, I can memorize most things the professors bring up in lectures, after hearing and applying it once, this worked for me in school and seems to keep working in university.


But the thing is that I am now at a point where I need to get some kind of studying routine, this is not going to keep working when I need to study for tests in which i need to utilize 9 semesters worth of content.
My finals are in 1 week, and I can not pressure myself mentally, because I have no reasonable worries about passing, it seems impossible to fail any of those, but on the other hand I also really want to study for them to see how well I could do.


For the last 8 or 9 days, I have managed to get ~1 hour of studying done per day, and only by taking in a lot of coffee or energy drink, and I do not like using either of those, since I am 100% sure those will stop working eventually and I really do not want to end up in a spot where I am completely unable to get anything done, especially since this is a great route towards substance abuse.


I've tried talking to the ""student counseling"" thing they have for law students, but they are generally not looking to help you with these kind of things, they are more focussed on helping low-performance students understand the subject.


Would it be reasonable for me to visit a doctor? If that is the case, can I get that done without my parents knowing?

I pet her thinking she wanted attention but she kept whining and shoving her paws into me. Something told me she was trying to tell me something. I look around and saw that one of the screen doors was left open wide enough for the little shih tzu to get out. I ran  to go look for it and thank God I found it before it went off too far.

- Failed a spanish essay because I can't print it out, and the prof insists that we need to turn in a printed copy *in class*, and while I tried to explain that I couldn't print my essay without a University Card to pay for printing with, she told me to shutup and leave. In front of my whole class, which hurt. 

- I can't even drop this class because I have a hold on my account because my dad won't help me pay for college this semester because he ""doesn't feel like it."" So I'm stuck. This prof made me so angry that I may just drop the class even after add/drop ends.

Basically I want to take this long toolbox and make it into a shorter one. 

The toolbox I have is made of this unusual thick plastic that (IMO) has a great quality to where you can melt it and fuse it back together again to where it is solid. I've already altered the tray that fits inside it extensively so I know how the plastic can be reformed and hold up afterwards.

The thing is... I want to make sure I dont fuck it up. I would like to know the best method for cutting out the parts precisely so they fit back together well. What tool to use etc etc.... I have access to an extensively stocked shop. Two in fact.

Note: the toolbox in the pic isnt the same toolbox I have but it is similar enough to the one I have to represent it properly in order to visually explain what I want to do. Also, the hasps on my toolbox are on the main body instead of the parts I want to cut out.
