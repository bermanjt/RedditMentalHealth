In addition, youtube could change its video algorithm in such a way that makes your videos significantly less popular.

1,"I'm 18. think I've been like mildly depressed for a few years now, although back in high school it was always pretty mild. Since it finished I can't see the point in life man. I can't find anything to get me out of bed. I'm just doing all this shit that I feel like if I don't do, society will judge me for. I go to college. I've got a part time job in fast food. And I hate it. Every minute. If I could, I'd quit both and sit on my ass all day. I tell myself I'd like to travel or whatever, but I doubt it would ever happen. I'm just scraping by on the bare minimum in college, which my parents have noticed, since in high school I was like straight A's. I just don't have any motivation whatsoever to study and graduate. I just don't see the point. I'd quit my job too, hell I've given it serious thought. But a couple of things hold me back.

For one it gives me the money to do the only thing I actually enjoy even slightly; going out at the weekend and getting drunk/wasted with my friends, which I sometimes can't even do due to work. Apart from that, when I'm off work, I just sit on my ass and watch TV constantly. A year ago I'd never touched a drop of alcohol. Now I drink every weekend and in the last few months I've started taking cocaine at parties and shit every other weekend. There's some times where I enjoy myself for a few hours and can just let loose, but a lot of the time I just sit, wasted and depressed, thinking over shit and wondering how THIS became one of the highlights of my week. 

The other reason I don't quit is this girl I work with. Talking to her's like the highlight of my week man. We're pretty close and I love being around her. She has a boyfriend though, and I'd never tell her and cause drama. Some would say I'm 'friendzoned' or whatever, and while it does hurt a bit, I'm not gonna complain. She doesn't owe me a damn thing, and besides, I don't want to drag her down with some loser like me who's got nothing else in his life worth it. She's joked before about how if I quit she would too, but I don't think she realise how true that is for me. She joked that she was gonna quit today, and for like half an hour I thought she was serious, and I thought to myself that I would too. Cause without her I couldn't drag myself to work some shitty job just to fund a few hours of escape at the weekend. But then she told me she was joking and I was relieved. But it really opened my damn eyes. Like for her I'm just a good friend, who she talks mostly to in work; but she's the reason I get out of my bed sometimes. That's not healthy man. I got a glimpse of what I'd do if she wasn't there, and I realised how fucking lacking my life is.

Everything just feels so damn hollow, so meaningless. I grind away all fucking week, hating every minute, wondering how people do this shit their whole lives. Most people have shit to live for, you know? A passion. A meaningful relationship. Kids. A job they love. I have nothing. No goals. No motivation. Just a girl with a boyfriend who I have a stupid crush on, and a few hours with my friends where I sometimes feel okay. Like man. That's depressing as shit. I don't know how this happened man. I put on a good facade, outside looking in I'm doing pretty well; a job, a social life, college. But inside I feel fucking awful almost all the damn time. None of it seems worth it man. I need something, anything to change this.

**TL;DR:** Been depressed for a few years. On paper things seem fine; I go to college, have a job and a social life. But I'm just scraping by in college, and I hate every minute of my job. The only reason I don't quit is to fund the weekend, and because I have a massive thing for a girl I work with who I'll never be with. I have nothing, no passion, no meaningful relationships, no goals.",04Jul2017,20

5,"I work at a grocery store a couple towns over from mine. I don't normally see people that I know, but all of the customers think they know me. They don't though, they know this other guy who looks similar to me, and lives in this town. After doing some digging and finding a picture of him, he doesn't look that much like me! I mean, there is a similarity I'll admit, but we don't look that similar! It's kinda frustrating having to explain to people that i'm not this person, and that it's someone else they're thinking of. Man, I wish I was half as popular as him, considering how often I bump into people that know him!",04Jul2017,2

7,"I met him seven years ago when we were thirteen in grade seven. He was put into my band class, even though he was never in the band. He was awkward, and quiet, and always stared at me every day but he never spoke. He has two massive scars on his lip, that everybody used to tease him about, but the first thing I noticed was his beautiful blue and hazel eyes. 


Whenever I approached him, he'd shut down and get really shy. I caught him so many times looking over his shoulder at me during class, he was so scared to admit it back then.


A year later he found his voice. He was excited, hyper, always smiling, always being nice to me, and mean to everyone else around us. He was a bully to many, but to me, he was so sweet. 
I saw him as annoying, but he saw me as something much more. After months of him pestering me I agreed to date him, at first it was to only get him to leave me alone; but I fell so hard for him in the end.


We ended after a couple of months. We were doomed from the start. His parents blamed me for him acting out, they accused me of being the reason why their son was difficult in school, and they accused me of a lot, actually. 


During those two months, I'd run away from him. I was scared of him to kiss me or to hold my hand because I didn't understand what I was feeling. I didn't *know* what I was feeling. The breakup was messy; it ended up with his mother showing up at my house, screaming at mine because I was the ""problem."" 


I was never the same.


The year after was a blur. Every time I saw him in the hallway I'd turn the other way. I had to abandon my friends because he was always there and I spent my days in the art room, drawing and creating stories to keep myself from breaking down. I hid in my own little fantasy world, and I became really good at writing stories and drawing. I couldn't shake that feeling, deep down inside every time I looked at him.


I started high school with the same group of friends I had to abandon previously. He wasn't in our school, and nobody knew where he went. Nobody really cared either, because nobody liked him. There were times where I'd forget him completely, and there were times where I'd cry myself to sleep wondering what he was doing. My heart still ached and I couldn't figure out why.


Grade eleven, I didn't feel any different. My grades began to plummet and I wasn't the high 90s student I used to be. My head was a mess, I didn't know what I wanted because I honestly didn't think I could make it this far. I was well known and well liked throughout the school, by numerous students and teachers alike. I never wanted to date, I was asked out before, but I couldn't bring myself to do it because all I thought about was him. I wondered where he went, I wondered what he was doing, I wondered if he was even thinking about me, I wondered about a lot of things. In the middle of that year, he contacted me on Facebook. ""Hey."" He said. My response? ""Fuck off."" And that's what he did; he fucked off.
I was scared. I was trying to run away like I did when we were thirteen. I thought about apologizing to him a few days after, but I could never bring myself to do it. I was so upset and angry at myself thinking I ruined that chance of getting back with him. My heart ached, even more, knowing that I ruined it before it could even start.


Grade twelve was an emotional rollercoaster for me. I was still failing and I already knew I'd need to repeat the year anyways. I stopped trying, I sunk all of my time into playing video games, and being online. My brain kept running back to that scenario when he said 'Hey."" Anxiety kicked in and I thought he'd never want to see me again so I never responded and left it at that. I was so broken back then.


My second year of grade twelve, a mutual friend ran into him over the weekend. They talked a lot, and surprisingly he asked about me. Within days he messaged me once more, and I decided to be friends with him; the right way. My heart exploded with joy, I finally had him in my life again after what happened previously. I didn't want to mess it up, but I still had that instinct to run away from him, from my emotions.


We were friends for a little over a year, and we talked every once in a while. I hit another low point knowing that I'd need to redo grade twelve again. Everybody I knew at this point was graduating, except for me. I didn't know what to do with my life, I was so down and upset. So I attempted suicide. I didn't tell him about my attempted suicide until I was released, but I remember that day; that night even, when we were talking.

 
Me: ""I don't think I'll go to school tomorrow... I'm just not feeling it.""

Him: ""You might regret it if you don't go, please do."" 


I did regret it.


The next morning I woke up, and I overdosed on every pill I had. It was a cocktail of medication, anti-depressants, sleeping pills, Tylenol, aspirin, Advil, there was a lot. A friend of mine came over out of the blue and found me convulsing on the floor in front of the toilet. I was rushed to the hospital, and I was in intensive care for over a week. I almost succeeded.


When I was released I told him what happened. He was always in a call with me, and he'd talk to me as I was drifting off to sleep. My body was detoxing, and it took me a few months to fully recover from what I had done. I felt like I had ice in my veins, I had really nasty bruises all over my body from the doctors putting in IVs and trying to take my blood, I was so fatigued I could only stay awake for a couple of hours a day, and he was there for me through it all.


When I could walk, and stay awake for more than five hours, he asked me if I would go on a date with him. I said yes. Of course, I said yes! I didn't want to run away anymore, but a part of me was still so skeptical because of what happened before. A part of me believed that it was too good to be true.


I had my walls up, big time. He locked up my heart and tossed away the key all those years ago, I didn't really think I'd ever find it again. Every day I tried to chisel away at the wall that guarded my emotions but to no avail. He noticed the struggle, and I felt so bad because it was everything I ever dreamed of, being with him again. 


*So why couldn't I do it?*


We lasted about a couple of weeks before he broke it off again. We ended explosively. He said I was manipulative, I never changed, and that his parents were right about me. I told him ""You are the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life. I wish I never met you."" and I blocked him without a second thought. I shattered him, and I didn’t realize it until later.


I spent the entire summer healing my confused mind, my dazed heart, and detoxing from the episode I had. Our mutual friend reached out to me, 
""Corbin says he's sorry."" 
""I don't care.""
He said all of hurtful things about me, and I wasn't in any mood to reconcile.


A couple of months later I decided to unblock him, and within a few days, he messaged me again. We picked up where we left off, apologized for what happened, and then we started being best friends again. I was starting to feel some of those feelings I had felt for all of those years slowly creep their way in again, and I was excited.


In November we gave it another shot. We were doomed from the start though. His parents hated me as if the first breakup was only yesterday; nothing's changed in their eyes at all. They took it out on him a lot, they always fought and yelled, and they were all extremely close too before I came into the picture... 


I was so angry at myself for that. I felt like I was the problem, I just wanted him to get along with his family. Then his friends started saying things to get under his skin about me. He spent 24/7 with me. He didn't want to spend time with anyone else. (Ultimately, he decided to remove himself from his friend group, without telling them why. So the entire time they sat there resenting me and thinking I told him to do it.)
""I'm making up for all of those lost years I didn't have you."" He told me. 


I had no idea he felt the same way I did...


He talked about how he felt, and how upset he was for all of those years too. How he pushed everyone away from him, how he'd watch all those sappy romance movies and cry because it wasn't us, the love notes and poems he'd written about me ever since grade eight, the whole nine yards. 


I was scared. I felt the urge to run again, and so I did. I lied to him, I said I didn't think about him at all and made up a story about being with a few other people. I used to compare them to him, in an attempt to discourage him because I was so scared of my true feelings. I didn’t just lie though; I brought these lies to life by forging text messages and creating intense, detailed stories… Little did I know, it worked.


Months went by, we had a lot of happy memories and moments, many cold winter nights where we walked down the street holding hands and smiling, many nights sitting at Tim Hortons with hot chocolates, we did everything together, and I still couldn't force myself to come clean to him about my lie.


Even after knowing what he did all of those years, I still couldn't find the courage to say it because I didn't know what would happen. It was that unknown factor that scared me the most, but I also didn't realize that the longer I carried it on, the harder it was going to be later on to come clean.


We signed our first lease together in March 2017. We were both excited to start our lives together without his parents telling us otherwise. He swore up and down he'd marry me, and we'd be together until the world ended. It was ""us versus the world,"" he'd always say, with a smile on his face, and his arm around my shoulder. By then, I found myself falling in love with him all over again. All those years of burying my emotions I felt them bubble up and rise to the surface. I was so madly in love with him, and I was so ecstatic knowing that I finally had him again. He was my world, my guardian angel, my star-crossed lover, he was everything to me. He always treated me nicely, took me out on dates, spoiled the hell out of me with fancy and expensive gifts, but I knew he was hurting because of the lie I told him in the beginning.


But I couldn't tell him the truth. I was so scared.


A couple of days after we moved in together, I came clean. I couldn't live with the guilt anymore; I wanted a fresh start, a clean slate. I knew I'd have a lot of work to do to gain his trust again, and I was willing to do whatever it takes. Since he already told me before he loved me with all of his heart, and we’d always work through whatever life threw at us, so I thought we’d get through this.


He broke.


He didn't know what to believe. He didn't know who I truly was. We went to bed that night, holding each other and snuggling up against one another as we usually did, and he woke up the next morning looking at me differently. 


I had no idea he saw me differently that morning, I thought we were growing because he never showed any resentment, he always had a smile on his face and he was always excited to see me whenever he came home. Since I didn't have a job, I decided to cook and clean everything constantly, I wanted to have a nice tidy space for us to thrive in. We were living on his income. I was looking for jobs, but to no avail, I had no interviews. He was getting stressed as the days went on, we had to take out loans and could barely afford anything as it was. We were already facing eviction by the end of June. He got angrier and angrier as the days went by, I tried my best to keep a smile on my face, but the constant negative energy was making me just as agitated and eventually, I started to fight back.


One day he snapped. He kicked me out late at night and told me we were done. It came out of the blue for me because I had no idea he was harboring such negative feelings towards me. I packed my things with the help of friends and family and I went back home to live with my parents. 


A week went by and we talked about what happened. He said the lie I told messed him up so bad that he couldn't think straight, he lost all of his feelings for everything; work, friends, family, and me. I begged for him to give me another chance to redeem myself, as I thought I already was because he never told me these things back then. He said he didn't know because his friends and family all told him he was better off without me, and they all started to make fun of me to him; he started to join in too.


I was broken. One day he'd message me begging for me to go over, we'd talk and laugh on the couch, cuddle and hold one another, and even just a few days ago he asked me to move back in with him. I said no of course, because his parents agreed to help pay his rent as long as I was out of the picture, and I knew he needed the money to begin with. For the past couple of weeks he'd flip between wanting me and hating me, I still have a bunch of messages from him saying everything he used to before, saying how lonely he's been without me, how he can't look at other women without thinking ""she's not her, she's not my Becca,"" how he's been missing me like crazy, and how we're ""secretly dating,"" talking about telling everyone when his parents help him with the money issue, telling me he’d give me another chance, and how he could never leave my side.


He blocked me on everything, without saying a word.


Told our mutual friend that he never wants to give me another chance and that he doesn't want to be friends ever again. Said he was tired of flipping and he's keeping to his decision. I feel like I’ve just wasted seven years of my life, my teenage years were spent moping around on him, and I still feel like he is the one I’m supposed to be with. I keep telling myself that he’ll come back but truthfully I don’t really know anymore.


 His friends and family have it all settled in that I was the problem, and that I was toxic… I think I lost my soul mate for good. I’m so confused and lost, I don’t even know what to do anymore. He told me I already lost him, he knows I’ll wait for him but he told me he wasn’t willing to wait for me again. I’ve been so numb ever since. I haven’t eaten anything in weeks, I can barely keep down water, I don’t even sleep because every time I do I feel his arms wrapped around me, and I have these micro dreams of us and it hurts so much.
 

It’s not fair what his parents and friends did. I feel like I’ve lost him forever because of this, because of what they constantly tell him. Our mutual friend told me that his friends wanted him to start telling lies to me to make me feel bad about myself a few days ago, and how they all make fun of me, my appearance, weight, etc. 


It hurts. It hurts so much… He told me himself he never wants to be friends with me after what happened, and I’m so scared to move on because I spent seven years trying to and I couldn’t. 


All those years I didn’t know what I was feeling, but now I finally understand what it was. He is my soul mate, my star-crossed lover who I’ll probably never see again because of this cruel twisted fate of events. He will always be the one who got away-- who was *torn* away from me… 


My only wish is for us to find our way back to one another in the future, years down the road. I don’t even know if that’s possible after what was said about me by his friends and family to him, especially now that he believes them and he sided with them.

9,"When I was young, I used to write short stories.  I would put on some music, sit in front of a computer, close my eyes, and get lost in the rhythm of the keys.  In my mind I would form such clear pictures, like a waking dream.  And the words, the words would flow through me.  They had a rhythm, a cadence, a poetry, and I would get lost in them.  I could just sit and type; hours would go by and I wouldn't even notice.  In those perfect moments I felt as though I were a part of something wonderful.  Over time I wrote less and less until eventually I stopped writing altogether.  Occasionally, I will try to start again, but it's never the same.  Now it is like work, trying to force something that used to come naturally...and now I find myself again searching for that place where the words flowed like water and I was a part of something beautiful.",04Jul2017,4

I was sexually assaulted about 6-7 months ago. Now, whenever I'm nervous, rattled, or in a high stress situation, I tend to react somewhat intensely when someone touches me, like lurching away. I wasn't even aware I was doing it until a friend of mine told another friend to stop touching me after we went through something that had us all on edge, because I was ""freaking out"" every time he did. Until that moment, I had no idea I was even doing anything.",04Jul2017,4
12,"It first happened when she was a baby. 

Her mother didn't dwell on it too much, maybe not all infants are the same, it was just a little odd.  Most babies cried in the middle of the night, but she didn't. *She laughed*. It was adorable at first, tiny squeals of laughter lighting up the cold, dark winter nights with her unmistakable giggle. Then it happened again, at the same time. And again. Every time she'd be wide awake, sitting up grasping through her crib.

The doctor was not fussed, why would he be? A baby that laughs and never cries, most mothers would kill to have a child that like that. 

Little Lora was special, there was no doubt about it. As she learned to walk by herself her expression became even more delightful. There was no stopping her, at the park, at the market, down town, wherever her mother would bring her she'd run everywhere, as if chasing the wind. 

Everything seemed perfect. Until she could talk. 

It never felt right. Even her first words. Lora wouldn't respond to her mother, instead she would start herself in the middle of a different word or sentence. Her attention was not fixed, and she never made sense. Her poor mother feared she'd passed on her impediments to her young daughter, being raised alone and without friends or a father, she naturally blamed herself. 

One evening she stayed up drawing and talking, right through the dead of night. Her bed was blanketed with wild illustrations of smiles, wisps, ..and eyes. 

Lora's mother could not ignore this anymore, she lifted her child out of her bed and sat her up, sitting on the end herself. 

""Lora, sweety, look at me honey. It's time to go to bed ok?"" 

"".... I don't know."", Lora replied hazily, she wasn't focused on her mother. 

""Honey. Look, it's freezing out tonight. Why don't you come sleep with mummy? I'll keep you warm."" 

""...Mummy?""

""Yes. Yes sweety, what is it?"" 

""...

*...it's five.""*

Checking the bedside clock, it was only 3am. 

""Sweety, no.. it's three. Come on dear, come here.""

*""....I don't like number five....""*, she was shaking now. 

""Lora. What's wrong dear, you're shivering.. oh my goodness,...come here."", her mother blanketed her and cradled the young toddler.

""Sweety, what's wrong? What's five? You can tell me."" 

*"".... promise you wont tell any one?""* 

""..Yes sweetie-pie I promise, you can tell me. What is it?""

...*""don't be scared mommy.""*

Her mother could not understand what was wrong, she was finally talking to her child, properly. But for the first time she saw fear in her daughter's eyes. 

""Lora, I'm here baby. No one can hurt you. Tell me, what's wrong?"" 

&amp;nbsp;

Lora spoke slowly, she looked straight into her mother's eyes, and pointed towards her bookshelf in the corner of the room.

&amp;nbsp;

""..number one is a lonely creature.. she is short and furry, the door bell freaks her..""

&amp;nbsp; 

She then pointed out to the hallway. 

&amp;nbsp;

""..my best-est friend though is number two.. he moves the lantern in the loo.""

&amp;nbsp; 

Now pointing at the dressing table.

&amp;nbsp;

""..number three is sad, but I cheer her.. when mommy's sleeping we talk in the mirror."" 

&amp;nbsp;

Then to the bedroom door.

&amp;nbsp; 

""..the crying lady, that's number four.. she smells weird, she hides behind the door.""

&amp;nbsp;

Suddenly, she drew her hands back inside the blanket and began to tear up, she whispered.

&amp;nbsp; 

""..but the clown.. he's been here the whole time.. *he's behind you now mommy, .. he is number five.*""

But I'm just lonely. I shouldn't be taken seriously. Just as I'm depressed. I shouldn't be taken seriously.",04Jul2017,27
17,"I met my best friend my Freshmen year in college. We were paired up together as roommates due to our similarities: we were both night people, we both enjoyed video games, and we both spent our youths playing music in orchestras and wind ensembles. By all accounts it was a slam dunk pairing. But somebody in the office dropped the ball. My roommate was weird. Not like a ""hm, he likes reading about snow globe manufacturing. Alright, different strokes I guess?"" More like ""hm, he's created an entire fictionalized version of Walt Whitman who makes perverted jokes, and he'll routinely jump into this character for no reason in the middle of conversation."" I was both confused and alarmed. If this is what was to come over the following nine months, I would rather drop out. I didn't want my dorm room to just be a place that I came back to sleep every night, which is where things were headed since I was avoiding him.

Well dropping out is rather severe, but I *did* start the process of transferring rooms. Early in that process, my friend convinced me to abort the process. See, I had made a point before the semester started that I wanted to expand my experiences and my expectations. I don't want to just snooze through college or life. That'd be easy to just stay asleep through everything. I don't want to be a person with a narrow view of what life 'should' be. ""Challenge yourself,"" he said. Well this isn't really the context I was talking about....but I suppose you have a point. So I canceled the request. Let's see how I feel by the end of this semester at least.

Well if you understand tropes at all, it shouldn't surprise you that this ended up being a great decision. I slowly started to appreciate his odd humor. Matt had such a unique perspective on life and on relationships. The more time I spent with him, the more I could see this odd, unconventional, and brilliant perspective. By Thanksgiving, we were cracking each other up. He wasn't just weird, he was probably clinically insane. But his laugh was so contagious, I couldn't snooze through anything with him and his unique perspective around. His laughter could wake me from slumber and have me laughing alongside him.

We quickly became close friends after that. There were *many* nights of making each other laugh until we cried, where we wouldn't even fall asleep before class the next morning. We ended up living together for three years before life forced us apart. Once we left school, we saw each other much less. That's what happens as you enter your 20s. Time and attention become much more divided. But we still made time for each other when we could.

It was summer of 2015 when I got the call. I was sleeping, but his call woke me up. He went in to see a doctor because a migraine was causing blurred vision. They were digging around trying to fix that issue when they found the tumor. And boy, it was a doozy. The tumor was very big, growing in several regions of the brain. *The doctors have to act quickly*, he told me. Surgery was coming soon, and it carried with it a large amount of risk. We spent that lengthy phone conversation joking about cancer, his doctors, me, his dog, his girlfriend...and of course, we shared numerous jokes about the very real, *very* looming prospect of death. The only way he and I know how to deal with fear is through laughter, so we dove into the deep end.

Well as it turns out, the surgery is a success! He wakes up fine! He didn't lose any memories or any of the amazing personality traits that made him so unique. We all couldn't be happier! There's still a long treatment process in front of him. But now that the surgery worked, treatment should be easier.

""Easier"" is never a guarantee. Matt was dead about six weeks later. He fell asleep and never woke back up. The tumor was too big and aggressive to properly fight against.

I was confused. How could a tumor this big and aggressive show up and not have any sort of impact on his personality? Cancer isn't a god damn virus. It takes time to do it's deadly damage! That hardly seemed just! This radiant source of warm insanity went from stable and seemingly everlasting to dead in the blink of an eye! Fuck you cancer! What the hell! How could Matt go from seemingly healthy to *dead* in just two months?

He didn't.

The doctors suggested that this tumor had been growing for years. Possibly over a decade. The entire length of our friendship, everything I knew about him....his life during that time was unknowingly spent the shadow of this cancerous threat. ""Wouldn't this have eventually impacted his personality?"" I asked the doctors. It most certainly did.

I didn't really press the issue, but I've always wondered. The things that made Matt weird, the things that almost chased me away at first but eventually helped me love him, the things that helped wake me up to such a refreshing perspective on the world and provided me with enough laughter to last a lifetime. Was that really Matt? Or was it just that fucking tumor?

Man I grappled with this for weeks. How much of him still ""existed"" by the end? Was he still the same guy I befriended years ago? How much of him ""existed"" when I originally befriended him? Or was he already too far gone?

That was the completely wrong perspective. Whether or not the tumor gave him his quirks is irrelevant. If they did, then they did. If they didn't, then they didn't. Trying to attribute a certain amount of ""Mattness"" to his life before and after the tumor is an exercise in futility. I don't care where his quirks come from. They are the things I love about him. Perhaps I should be thankful for the tumor for creating such a unique human being. Even the worst things in life can have positive consequences.

This is when I started to become friends with Matt's girlfriend. Or rather, fiance (this was a recent decision made shortly before he died). Well, ex fiance? Near-widow? Wife-after-life? I still don't fucking know what term to use. We helped each other, at times, in our grief. I won't pretend I had a ""harder"" time than her, but knowing that she was experiencing somewhat similar thoughts and issues as me gave me some comfort. It helped me feel less alone.

We are still friends today. Unconventional friends, but friends. We aren't really similar. We have somewhat different interests, tastes, and goals. Our only commonality really is that we both lost this crazy, unique person from our lives. Apparently that is enough. We're taking a road trip together next month. Because fuck it. Why not?

That's one of my biggest takeaways from my friendships with Matt. The best way to make a new friend is to just be willing to make a friend. Just roll with the things that make them unique. Instead of seeing the things that make you different, try to see the things that make you the same. From there, the you can appreciate why the things that make you different are the way that they are. In my case with Matt, we eventually ended with many more similarities, instead of the many differences we started with. Because in an attempt to seek similarities, I could better see the lens through which he saw the world. In my case with Emily, our differences are many, but our similarity is strong: we had a strange, confusing, brilliant, energetic man in our life. And now we don't. Neither of us really know whether to hate the tumor for robbing our future of his love, or thank the tumor for potentially helping to create such wonderful presence in our life. Even if it was for only a few years. But his unique perspective and his contagious laughter are not forgotten. This shared pain, and the shared love, is enough for us.",04Jul2017,7

22,"I am unemployed since last year. I worked three years in different sectors. I was laid off because of not feeding boss and his secretary ego. I learnt that I was fired when I was sitting at home. I found some freelance jobs, three months later I found another. In the interview I was told that the person who was working for this position promoted to another country and thats why they were looking for someone to fill the gap. But later I learnt that she was an office girl, she left it for another job in the same city. I started to work there and I had my first fight with a woman with schizophrenia. I worked there 7 months and they didn't do my contract and my collegues were hiding information about the job, I was not included to group mails. They didn't teach me the work and criticised me for not being qualified enough. I openly told them the reasons and asked them to find another person for my position. The person who criticised me step back and said to me he was very satisfied with me. wtf? I became demotivated and just one day later I was fired again. I am happy as I am not there anymore but becoming hopeless after interviews with irritating person like the one who told me "" we will call you, if this candidate can not pass three months trial period"".

I don't believe that I am an empty person. I worked in international projects, I have volunteer experience etc. I live on my own, I stand on my own feet.

I look around me my friend's who has no experience or who doesn't know even how to work on word, excel, they work in places they requiere word, excel.

I don't want to meet my friends, my parents friends, because they always ask me questions about work which make me upset.

I applied to other countries, other cities but still no answer.

43,"When I was younger, I used to get frequent severe stomach cramps and diarrhea. Looking back on this as an adult, it seems likely that I have or had some kind of food allergy or intolerance. My parents' response was usually to tell me that it was my own fault for being fat and eating like a pig, which I guess I accepted as true.

In retrospect, it seems like seeking medical intervention of some kind would have been the more appropriate course of action. Huh. Oh well. ",04Jul2017,247
