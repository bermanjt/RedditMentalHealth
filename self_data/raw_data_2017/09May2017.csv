2,"Old Post:
I went for a workout class. Im 38, overweight, and formerly in shape man.
I went to a crossfit type class, and was easily the oldest person there by at least 5-8 years, with the class average seeming to be in the mid to late 20's.
I could barely keep up with the class, let alone the other people in it. I used to be able to run 15 miles, do a dozen pull ups in a row, 50 push up and 100 sit ups without stopping. Not anymore.
I left that class feeling sorry for myself and like I was just better off giving up. I have recently been though a few injuries, and found out that I have arthritis in my lower spine. Nothing major but all things I need to take care of better. By losing weight and getting stronger.
I decided that instead of giving in and giving up, I am going to start training properly again, and my goal is to run a full marathon when I hit 40. I have plenty of time, but I need to start now. I want to lose 40 -50 pounds (currently 218) by my 40th as well.
Not looking for pats on the back, or encouragement. I wanted to put this out there for myself, and for those of us who feel that they have to give up and give in. I am going to fight and push myself to be better, not because I want to impress others, but because I want to impress myself.


This was about three months ago.

I currently weigh 191lbs.  

I can run 9 miles at a clip without stopping, and feel like I could easily go farther (being a dad and having a full time job makes running for over an hour and a half a rare occurrence.)

I can do 10 pull ups again, and 40 push ups without stopping.

I also had to purchase a new suit, since mine all fit terribly.

Lost 3 inches off of my waist, 1 off of my neck.

Next goal is less than 185 by mid July, and 170 by Christmas.

Added bonus: went to a doctor, and had a checkup.  BP was 150/90 in February.  Now 130/80.",09May2017,2

But my last therapist I went to seemed to want to set an action plan in my life so after 8 or 12 meetings I wouldn't need to see him anymore. Maybe that's what therapists are really for? I didn't really want that though. I just wanted someone to listen.",09May2017,3
7,"So back just under a year ago I went for a job interview for my shitty fast food job. When I was there there was this really cute girl who was there for the interview too. I did notice her straight away but she was there with her boyfriend who I'm guessing must have been there for support or something. Anyway, it was clear she was off limits, and in all honesty I wasn't even thinking about any of this all that much at the time cause I didn't think I'd ever see her again. Just one of those attractive girls you see and don't ever think of again.

Or so I thought. Cause we both got hired. We got trained together and it became obvious pretty quickly we were gonna get along well. We have such similar senses of humour, into the same shows and movies and shit, and grew up in the same town. It feels like we just kind of instantly 'got' each other. Anyway, we grew closer and closer cause we got trained together, so we seen each other a whole damn lot. Any thought of anything happening between us was completely off the table though. For one I knew already she had a boyfriend, and for a long time after we met I was crushing hard on another girl. I just saw her as a really good friend who helped me get through the day when I had to work.

The last couple of months things have kind of changed though. For one, I realised things with this other girl weren't going to work out. Also, the girl from work split up with her boyfriend. We've been gradually been talking more and more outside of work and things are just kind of getting increasingly flirty between us. I can't really put my finger on it. It just seems like we're trying to find some excuse to talk to each other all the time and when we do we usually talk for hours. I'm definitely crushing on her at this point, more and more each time we talk I suppose.

But the problem is that when i realise I like a girl, I become so damn awkward around them. Up until now things between us have been so effortless and like we just get along without trying, but I feel like when I talk to her now I'm trying to think of like the best thing to say or whatever and it just feels more forced. One time I didn't work with her for a couple of weeks and when she was back after that I felt so damn nervous, I had like serious butterflies going on. It made talking to her pretty difficult. Anyway, she asked me today if I'm going to this party at the weekend. I was kind of confused cause I had no idea she knew the person hosting it and now that I think about it I have no idea how she knew I'm going. Anyway, I told her that I am and she seemed pretty excited. This is the first time we're gonna be hanging out outside of work (apart from a staff night out) and I haven't saw her in a while, I feel kind of nervous just thinking about it. I think a bit of alcohol will help loosen me up a little, but how can I overcome feeling so awkward around girls I like and just have a good night around her without fucking up somehow?

**TL;DR:** Met girl at work who I hit it off with instantly. She had a boyfriend, I liked someone else, so no pressure and it was clear nothing was gonna happen. She split up, I moved on, and now things seem to be escalating between us. Feel increasingly weird around her the more I like her. How do I not act awkward around her at a party this weekend and have a good time?",09May2017,2

Jumping right in... 

(16/F) In my freshman year of high school (2ish years ago) I was dumb and did/received oral with another girl. I think my vagina is semi normal like no signs of anything but today I noticed a red patch of small bumps near both sides of my butthole and it is a little irritating when they rub together. I looked up what might be and one of the options is anus herpes because of HPV and that makes me scared because if I've waiting this long for something to happen because of the potential disease it's gotta be bad right?? So what do I do. My parents think I'm a very good kid and honestly, I am, I was so dumb thinking back on what happened. Talking to them would be the most awkward ever, any other advice?? 

Thank you so much, I'm kind of freaking out. ",09May2017,1

I would be honestly so much happier in life if I was incapable of feeling romantic attraction and had no sexual desire, then I would never have to worry about this shit instead of having it bug me for no reason. 

What I would give to never have to masturbate again. What I would give to feel absolutely nothing upon seeing a woman naked. What I would give to never have a crush on anyone. What I would give to free up this part of my brain for more important things and leave sex/romance to people who actually want it.

17,"This is really, really fucking hard. It's been 3 months. I still feel as if someone somehow excavated a perfect, 4 inches long, 2¼ inches in diameter, cylinder of flesh out of my chest and sealed it back up. Hot, stagnant air within. 

Some days, I actually feel pretty damn good, though. I'd say I've had up to almost two weeks in a row of feeling okay. But my mood  always seems to come crashing back down into a pile of warm, dark, chemical sleet. That's bipolar II for you, though. Yeah, turns out I'm bipolar, by the way. Interesting, right? Who woulda thunk. Right; me. 

I think about you a lot. You really were the adjacent puzzle piece that fit perfectly next to me in the 7,000,000,000 piece puzzle called life on earth. Our ambitions just pulled us apart. We both wanted to be in different sections of the puzzle. Deep. Nice analogy. Thanks. I know. 

I miss your warmth. Literal and metaphoric. You always knew how to make me feel okay. That things will be alright. You made me feel really confident in myself. In my huge, complicated, borderline [insane] personality. You made me feel beautiful. I know I have to learn how to feel that way on my own, and I've been getting closer and closer these past 4 years, but it's still very hard. 

You're so smart. I miss your intelligence. You're so fucking good at being an adult. Taxes. Resumés. Budgeting. Credit cards. Envelopes. Stamps. Fucking stamps. You were such an amazing resource to me. Whenever I needed help with an adult thing, I went to you. You had it all down. Calendars. Appointments. Folders. Files. You had a LETTER OPENER. 

I miss your basement. Your warmly-lit with Edison lightbulbs basement. Edison lightbulbs. Can't look at those the same anymore. Antiques everywhere. You're so talented at restoring them. I found that so beautiful, restoring antiques. ""Giving something old and forgotten a new life."" I loved that. What a beautifully metaphoric, adorably empathetic, delicate, unique hobby to have. 

Edison record players. Cylindrical records. I don't know where the one I bought you for valentine's day went. I think my mom took it to a thrift shop. I couldn't handle doing it myself. 

1889 pepsi. Ginger.

Your space was always so clean. Meticulously clean. Clean in the way I wish my brain was. I guess that's why it was so comforting to me. As I sit here writing this, I can see hairs on my hardwood floor. Socks. Everywhere. An empty beer bottle. Hairs. Some aren't mine.

I hooked up with this guy. It was nice, but I can already feel myself clinging on. I'm about to stop talking to him. It's just a hook up, but I can't help but long for someone to love me. I miss that so much. I wish loving myself were easy. I don't know why I got dealt the hand of brain cards that I did, but I wish I hadn't. You made my hand feel less shitty. 

It's been almost 4 years of constant therapy and medication changes. I'm 22. I still don't love myself. You'd tell me I'm still so young. I don't feel it. You helped me love myself a little more, but I wish I still had you to help me continue trucking on in my journey to find love, peace and balance within myself. Being with you made me feel the way the beginning of ""Montana"" by Youth Lagoon sounds.

Your face haunts me. I sometimes think about it. I have this go-to memory that will sometimes play on repeat in my brain when I think about you. You're standing in front of the basement sink next to the dryer, butt-ass naked brushing your teeth. You're facing away from me. You turn your head around, revealing your profile. You're mid-tooth-scrub, you look at me, smile, giggle and look forward. You're the only person I've ever met that still looked beautiful while brushing your teeth. That over the shoulder stare will forever be engrained in my mind. 

Your eyes, the way they squinched when you smiled. Your smile, complete with lil' dimples. Your nose. Fuck; your nose. The most perfect curve. Borderline brachistochrone. I'll never kiss a nose quite like it. Your laugh. Such a cute laugh. The auditory equivalent of throwing freshly picked cotton, complete with little bits of dirt and seed, at someone's face under the sun. 

You were so, wholly, seemingly irreplaceably important to me. Your presence in my life and everything you did for me meant and still means the entire universe to me. Every single atom of this strange bubble of mystery expanding at the speed of light that we call the universe could never replace the love, warmth, importance, peace and purpose our relationship made me feel.

I only hope I can find a man half like you again someday. A feat like that seems impossible, though.

You're one of a kind. A truly unique, beautiful, feat of genetic probability. 

I hate to say this, but, I still love you. 

Miss you.

26,"Everything sounds easy, and well somethings _are_. It's just the matter of doing that's _hard_. 

One by one? Sure. But the moment it doesn't work out, I move on to the next. Ah just trying something else since this isn't going well, sure. But it's moreso of _giving up_ ^^^again ^^^and ^^^again.

Sleep, that's a thing I'd like to do. I prefer getting high over getting drunk, since it's faster and also no worries for beer belly or nasty drinks. But I'm in a non-weed high that feels awful. Maybe I'm hallucinating? or well, I can't tell if I'm living? 

If I were told I'm dreaming, I'd believe it. Days are meshed and I can't tell what yesterday or a week before was. Dreams feel more real than reality. I don't know if I'm backed up on sleep now or if I've had too much. 

It's unsettling, not being able to tell. At first it was only for the first few minutes when I woke up. Unsure if I was still dreaming, but I'd know if I'm awake. But lately, it's like that all day. Am I going to wake up now? Sleeping is difficult. When I'm nodding off and feeling like my eye lids are going to drop, you'd think I'd sleep pretty quickly. But lying in bed, feels awful. It feels too quiet but then I start hearing my heart beat or my body tingles. Whether it's that want of being squeezed, or needing to feel some kind of feeling on my body. Almost like I need to slap it. Not numb or tingly, just- I need to slap it? 

I don't think it's a sexual desire, but I get that weird wanting feeling when I try to sleep. Wanting to be squeezed like a hug pillow. Or slapped up, especially the thigh region. 

Lying down for so long can only keep my sanity to a certain point. I'll get up and just keep watching my show or play with my hair. I'm running out of things to do with my hair without using hair products. Trying to curl them but I have too much hair and it's very tiring, also no bobby pins. I'll make myself tea or coffee just to make it but not really drink it. A bit itching to cook or bake too but, that's a mess to clean.

I need to get something. There's been no goals, no finishes for a long time. Dating needs to wait, but I want to fall in love again-longer, and for someone that'll love me back. But not just to fall in love- if it happens. It'll happen. I'll be in love with the boy not be in love with love. I want to care about someone differently again. Get to think about that person stroking my hair or having his hand on my cheek. Holding hands and all, cause man. Touching is wonderful. Feeling someone else's body heat. Super A+. I wish cuddling was as common as hand shaking. 

I can't have everything from the start, but I want to. And I know that's childish, but why not? As long as it won't stray from my other goals, right? If someone can like me in my current body and current situation, then they'll like me more when I improve? maybe, if they can wait for me but- that's a lot of trusting. 

It was an itch to see his picture, not the same pain. I don't long for him, it just hurts differently. That stupid boy hurt me a whole dang lot, and seeing him - eh. I showed my body to _him_? Why did I trust him so much, why'd I fall for him. I'm the stupid. And to think I was so happy. I feel, pathetic-and I feel cringe but tears too. I know it's not because I want him back, I guess it pulled the self esteem a lot down. But a lot more realization. No one can wait for me, not that long. I have to get better faster. Also learn to pick out boys better. And not fall for someone so quickly. Literally ""the way he looked at me"" was it. That was it. I disney princess'd it. The fuck.

I don't want to be the first in love, I don't want to be the only one waiting. Of course there's a lot of work needed for outside, and a lot more on the in. Then someone will want me, for a long time. A longer time. and maybe the next will be even longer. 

Whether it's flawed thinking, or maybe my thoughts aren't straighten out right now. Maybe I'm complaining, maybe I only feel this way at the moment. Maybe it'll change again. 

What am i going to do with that stupid brother. I barely have my shit under control, what do I do with his? Mine first, I guess. but what if it'll be too late by the time I'm done with mine? Don't you dare fucking die. Take care of mom before you go. Live a god damn life first. Fall in love, get your heart broken, raise a family, give mom allowance, buy her gaudy shit, make her food. I only have you I can call brother, I rather be able to say that for a long long time. Don't you dare die.",09May2017,1

Science is just a method of investigating phenomenon and hypothesizing causes and implecations. People have for some reason come to the conclusion that science is some kind of eternal truth like a preacher thumping on a Bible on the pulpit and claiming to be the messenger of God, only it's someone's aunt on Facebook posting a ""scientific"" article about how some vegetable makes your hair grow softer or something. People have become confused between methodology and results, and for some reason science has lost its real meaning and become just a defense for taking sides on certain issues. ""Science"" used to say it was safe to breathe asbestos. ""Science"" used to say that smoking was good for you. ""Science"" used to support the idea of spontaneous generation. Just because someone used the scientific method doesn't mean they came to a correct conclusion. Even if there were zero flaws in their methodology, they can still be wrong. People need to understand that science doesn't get ""settled"". Science is ever evolving and ever changing.

43,"I feel like my last relationship (also my first true one) really is making an lasting impact on how I approach setting myself up for future relationships in general.

How did my last attempt at love go? Well, it all started with a friendly hangout that became a weekend full of togetherness. First kiss? A day later and not long after she offered to buy me lunch. The following day? The very first time we got to say ""I love you"" to each other. I left that weekend so full of joy, happiness, and a full heart. Why? Most likely because this girl made her move on me and I ran away with it happily.

Where did I f*ck up? Possibly because I was set to marry her just two months later without letting my parents know. End result: angry mom, several breakups and reunions to that girl, and a worn out concern for where I am supposed to stand.

Where am I today? We are still good friends, but our love for each other still runs deep. I am the symbol of true love for her because she had been through so many guys who were in it to bang her. To me, she represents almost everything I ever wanted in finding love. A woman who makes her move on me, a friend who grew to be my lover...these were some of my hopes of how I would first find my way to my first relationship. She's actively all over POF searching for her next man and I'm stuck on another dating site just hoping I can make it to the second date. Honestly, she's much closer than me because she had a relationship (even though it fell out months later) since our final breakup. On the other hand, I've had a few dates and have yet to get that coveted second date.

My confidence isn't shaken, but sometimes it does get frustrating and I feel that I sometimes look back at my last relationship: she handed me her love on a platter and I ate the whole thing. I fell in so easy, yet so happily. I don't regret that I got to share a relationship with her, but maybe I'm expecting too much if I think it's going to happen that way again, if not similar. Whether in-person or on Tinder, most girls probably wouldn't make the first move on you (I can rant on that another day though) and if you want a relationship, you gotta be straight up; trying to friendship your way to love doesn't work I would assume. And I'll just leave it at that for discussion.

&amp;nbsp;

**Background info (2014):** When I was 17 and a senior in high school, I had just moved across the city, went to a completely new school, etc. I never really made any friends because I already had friends outside of school thanks to fun job I got as soon as I moved. I had a summer fling with someone I'll call Ben[20M](at the time), things were going perfect for me, outside of school. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
About 6 months after I moved, I got bored with Ben. I saw that I was getting attracted to other people, so I ended things with him. We ended didn't end on bad terms, but I basically ghosted him after we ended because I was childish and didn't know how to deal with those types of things. Ben isn't the bad guy in this situation (Ben takes part in this story, I promise this isn't irrelevant).

&amp;nbsp;

**Meeting Jerry, the beginning:** I went to school with this guy who I'll go ahead and call Jerry [17M] (at the time). Gosh, I was head over heals for this guy. He didn't even know my name. It was a typical high school romance. I pulled a move on him and a couple weeks later we made it official. Jerry, was the basic ""bad boy."" Early in our relationship I knew he smoked weed. It was whatever. Its not for me, but it didn't bother me that he did it, at least at first. I wasn't into drugs too much when I met him, but shit really hit the fan during our prom night. We went to a pre-prom party, everyone was drinking and having a great time, things escalated and the next thing I knew I was in a restroom and Jerry &amp; his friends and we were all smoking weed and doing coke. I had never done coke before, it was in the heat of the moment.

&amp;nbsp;

**Drug habits with Jerry begin** I noticed Jerrys drug habits get worse and worse, and I was forming them too because I thought it gave us something to do. I tried to fix him, obviously that didn't work, I was too blinded by love to leave him, so I let myself indulge in all of the nonsense he was getting into just to be with him. I hate myself for that.

**2015, Jerry &amp; I are 18 at this point / family background:** Time went by, we graduated, we continued our relationship. Continued the drugs. Things were okay. They were past the honeymoon phase, but I wasn't miserable with him (just yet). Of course, I became distant with my family. If I wasn’t at work, I was either with Jerry or my best friend [20F]. My family tried to confront me about it, I would just use my job as an excuse. I would even purposely work on holidays so that I didn’t have to spend them with my family. In a way, I was resentful towards them. They wanted the best for me, but it wasn’t what I wanted, so I spent as much time as I could for the sake of saving an argument with them. I spent more time with Jerrys family, they had it all together in comparison to mine. Jerry had great parents, his mom was a teacher and his dad had a great government job. They would have family dinner every night! Even 4th of July cookouts! I never had that. I was poor growing up, my parents focused on working minimum wage jobs to support our family. My dad was a short tempered alcoholic. I can’t even remember having any family dinner with them even before I started dating. Family events were depressing. Although I had these issues... I know they wanted the best for me regardless. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Reliance / Abuse begins:** Jerry &amp; I joined college, we got as many classes as we could together. Jerry hated school, I basically did all of his school work. He wasn’t going to do it for himself. I wanted the best for him, which is why I forced him into college and getting a job, etc. He got his first job around the same time we started college. He worked at a smoke shop, getting paid under the table at $5/hr an hour. He was such a bad employee, he somehow managed to get fired from the easiest job ever. When we would go out, I was the one paying. I was buying our food, I was buying things he wanted, I was the one paying for the drugs/alcohol. If I had $5 I would make sure we both ate, if he had $5 he’d spend it on himself and let me have a bite. On Jerrys first day on the job at the smoke shop, we went out to eat with my best friend. My best friend and I teased him about a female coworker he had. It obviously irritated him, so I stopped. My best friend stopped for a while as well, but she decided to drop one last joke and Jerry left. JERRY WAS MY RIDE. Honestly, I was tired of his shit. I was gonna end it. If he wanted to leave, he could go. My best friend knows me, she knew I was going to regret it, and she thought to “just let him walk away” was a dick move. She spoke me into following him. He was still in the parking lot. I got into his car so that I could talk things out. Things got a bit out of hand, so I decided to get out of the car and leave. He immediately grabbed me and forced me back in. I struggled trying to get away. When I finally did, he chased me, pulled me by hair, and dragged me by my hair back into the car. I was so scared, I was mad, I was a mix of every negative emotion. He realized he fucked up. I told him to leave, he cried and begged for my forgiveness. I wanted to believe he was genuinely sorry so I forgave him, but I clearly stated, “I’m giving you ONE chance. If you ever pull that shit on me I’m done.” He gave me my space for the night, we carried on like nothing happened. I should have left him LONG before this. 

&amp;nbsp;


**2016: Jerry gets arrested; guess which dumbass bailed him out of jail:** Jerry and I are 19 at this point. He didn’t want to go to class one morning and I still wanted to go. I needed a ride, he wanted to get high before my class started so we did. I went to class. I texted him. No response. Another text. Nothing. I got worried, called. No answer. I checked his location, he was at the county detention center. My heart dropped. I left class and walked my ass all the way over there to see what happened (my school was in downtown so it wasn’t too bad a walk). I was a mess. I had to call my best friend to pick me up and calm me down. She left work for me. I feel so bad about this. Jerry got pulled over for not having a front license plate (Texas Law). The car smelled like weed, they arrested him, searched his car and found a brass knuckle (Illegal in Texas). Jerry gets charged with possession of marijuana, and a prohibited weapon. $700 bond. I paid for that with my tax return money. He never even said thank you. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Things get even WORSE:** Jerry couldn’t find a job because of his background, and job standards were WAY too high for that. I ended up getting him a really cool job at a new restaurant that opened in our city. Now that he got a job I thought he would do better. But of course I was wrong. He spent most of his time either hiding in the restroom to not work, or getting high in his car. He was stealing alcohol from his job. He was opened to me about this. My best friend now worked with him as well. I would ask her about it too, I had to ask her to be completely honest with me, and she admitted the truth, even after I asked him to stop, he kept it up. I got a promotion at a second job I worked at so I decided to drop my first job and focus on the second. I was doing great for myself. I stopped doing drugs. I had a great job. Honestly, everything was great, but only for me. Jerry saw this. He resented it. He became jealous of my coworkers. He was blaming me on cheating. He did every thing he could in efforts to make me leave that job. He wasn’t even happy when I initially got hired with them. Jerry lost his job, his parents kicked him out, he was living out of his car. I sat down, and I spoke to my dad about letting jerry just shower at our place. My dad said no. I respected that. Jerry showed up at my window one early morning. He wanted to shower at my place, I explained I couldn’t sneak him in. My dad was asleep and the restroom was right by my parents room. Jerry got loud. My dad woke up. Keep in mind Jerry wasn’t even inside of my house during all of this. As soon as my dad went outside, jerry BOOKED it. He ran to his car and sped off. It made things look worse than what they were. In my dads eyes, he thought Jerry had spend the night and was sneaking out of my window. My dad LOST HIS SHIT. He started yelling and throwing things around the house, I locked my door and my dad broke it down. My dad pulled a knife on me and I ran away. I grabbed my car keys jumped out of the window, and started the car. My dad caught up. He tried to open my door, I backed out, and my dad held on. My dad fell, onto the floor. I pulled over, I’m never going to forget looking at him through the rear view mirror. He couldn’t get up. I wanted to help him, but he had just pulled a knife on me. That was my dad. I saw my neighbor run to my dad on the floor and I sped off. I knew someone was helping him, so I had to go. My dad going absolute ape shit wasn’t new, but that was definitely one of his worse cases. I called my mom, crying, she was at work and I told about everything. I begged her to go home and help him. I could see the ambulances rushing towards my house from my hiding spot. I’ve never been in such a horrible spot in my life. I spent hours trying to grow a pair to go to the hospital. My mom met me outside of the hospital, and gave me a huge talk. She said that if I was going to stay with Jerry, he was going to end up like my dad. I wasn’t going to get away from it until I left Jerry. 

&amp;nbsp;

**This is what I beat myself up over the most, I still didn’t leave Jerry.** I saw something in him that was never there. I let him push me around. I let him wear me out. I let him ruin my life at this point. I was far beyond blinded by love, I was just stupid. Around this time, I ran into Ben, (who is now 21), and he saw how stressed and over all how different I was. He knew about Jerry through social media. Ben became my shoulder to cry on. I opened up to him about these problems I was facing. I ended up emotionally cheating on Jerry. I opened up to Ben about missing him, I’d visit him sometimes with my best friend but we never did anything more than hug. I tried to end things with Jerry but he made it so hard. He would throw fits, cry, threaten to kill himself. He was completely toxic. He even faked a car accident one night I tried to end things with him. 

&amp;nbsp;

**The final night with Jerry:** There was a huge festival going on in my city, it was my favorite festival of year! I got out of work, headed over with Jerry and his friend, we ended up going to the festival and left later to a party. We met up with some of Jerrys “friends” who I had never even heard of before. We ended up at a party with a bunch of high school students. It was gross. I found myself in a car Jerry, and his three friends. They all either had illegal drugs or weapons on them. One of them wasn’t even sober enough to drive, yet he was still behind the wheel. I didn’t want to be a part of this. I told Jerry to take me home. He told his friend to drive me home, I refused. I told his friend to drive us to Jerrys car so that Jerry could take me home. Jerry pouted about it. We argued on our drive to my place. I said I didn’t like where we were at. We were partying with fucking high school students. It was pathetic. I told him I hated being in that car when everyone but me had something illegal on them. He didn’t see it. He decided to pull over some apartments by my house. Once again, I tried to get out of the car, he forced me back it. Just like the first time. He argued, yelled, cried. He knew I was done. He lost himself. I didn’t even open my mouth. I didn’t do anything but sit there and stare straight forward. He basically begged me to argue back, and I couldn’t. I didn’t have the motive. I told him, “there’s nothing to argue. I’m done.” He responded with, “You’re fucking done? Get the fuck out of my car then,” and he proceeded to get out of the drivers seat, rush over the passengers door, open it, and drag me by my hair of of his car. I fell onto the floor. I don’t want to get into anymore detail of that night, but I ended up with bruises and scrapes on my arms over the situation. 

&amp;nbsp;

**A future with Ben:** Ben saw me soon after this. He asked what happened. I broke down. I felt so bad. I left Ben and dove into this. I ruined my relationship with my family for this. I became a burdened to my best friend for this. 

&amp;nbsp;

Bens been back in my life for the past 8 months. We’re taking things EXTREMELY slow. We’re not even exclusively dating. We have each other around. I like it. The last thing I want is to be in any serious relationship. Things are going great with my family, my dad and I have become closer. My best friend is still around more than ever. 

&amp;nbsp;

**My personal problem:** Its been nearly a year and its almost like the more time goes by the more I beat myself up over it. I should have known better. I feel like I don’t deserve these relationships I have with Ben, my family, and my best friend. I wouldn’t have helped an ex the way Ben helped me. I would’ve disowned my daughter if she were me. I’d be so over my best friend if she continuously chose her boyfriend over me like I did with her. I don’t think I could ever thank them enough for letting me back in. I spend restless nights thinking about this. Every time I see the scare on my dad over him falling, I feel myself die a little bit. How do I comfort myself when these thoughts come in? How do I help myself get over this? Should I see a therapist? 

&amp;nbsp;

If you read all of this, thank you, from the bottom of my heart. 

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:** Ruined relationships with very valuable people in my life over abusive relationship with ex-boyfriend. Rebuilt said relationships. Feels unworthy.

Nasty allergies? Check.

Consumes way too much coffee? Check.

Consumes too much alcohol? Check.

Long bouts of cardio? Check.

52,"Since I can remember I've dealt with various mental health issues from eating disorders to clinical depression. Yet through it all dealing with the path of destruction I left myself after these episodes is the hardest thing I've had to face. 

Recovering is the easy part, you talk it over and take some prescription and you no longer want to kill yourself, great! But living after suicide is a whole other story.

You dig yourself a hole, a grave, you stop talking to people, you isolate yourself preparing the people around you for a world without you and you just keep digging your grave deeper and deeper and prepare for the soil to be piled on top of you. Something I did after my worse depressive episode when I was 15, but I stopped digging and ""recovered"" I didn't want to fill the hole in anymore yet I still had to escape it, the situation that had been created because of depression.

I had lost everything. I lost the friends that had helped me recover before, I lost my ability to talk to people, I lost the ability to walk down the school corridor alone without panicking with every step, I even left school because I was suddenly so alone. I had gone from being a ""popular"" social girl who would go out and take selfies at parties to someone who sat alone all day and night not speaking to a single person. No messages. No texts. No friends. 

I had to watch everyone around me go on and enjoy their teenage years, a life which I could have had. 

The worse thing is, is that it almost was as if I had died. I'm watching everyone go on without me, and nothing is different, but I didn't die. I chose recovery, but this time around I'm left with more than scars on my wrists but the reality that depression took away my chance at enjoying my teenage years, it took away my friends, it took away my opportunity to study for my dream job and left me broken hearted, isolated and stuck. Stuck in recovery. I'm not ""depressed"" anymore but I'm stuck in a life that my depression created and for me that's so much worse. The constant frustration that you lost some of the best people in your life because of an illness you couldn't help. That voice in the back of your head wondering what if you hadn't got sick, how much better your life would be now, whether you'd still have the same friends, the same laughs. You live in hope that someone will throw you a ladder and open their eyes to the fact that living after suicide is hard and can feel humiliating and really as strong as we may seem we need picked up and guided back into normality. Back into being socially active and being part of something because without social stimulation, for me, I'm a ticking time bomb.
