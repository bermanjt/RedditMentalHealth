2,"We're usually pretty open about letting each other use our phones, he has my password, and he goes through my phone all the time.  One morning a few weeks ago he was kind of watching me go through my messages while we were just laying around.  He saw me skim through a group chat where one of my friends had shared a picture of another one of our friends from a concert where she had mooned us at the tailgate.  

Later that night he asked about it again and I let him go on my phone to look at it.  A few minutes later he gave it back and that was the end (or so I thought).  Fast forward a few weeks to today and he confesses that he had actually sent it to himself that night and kept it.  He says he deleted it recently because he felt guilty and it was chewing him up inside.  He also apologized, and said he hopes I'll forgive him.  

It's been a couple of hours and I haven't responded yet, and I'm not sure what to do.  I'm pretty mad that he took it without my permission and that he kept a picture of another girl.  If I had caught him rather than him coming clean I would definitely dump him, but maybe his guilt and remorse is genuine.

13,"This is quite a long story, I'll try to condense it as much as possible without leaving out too much that ads to story... I'm sure I'll have plenty of naysayers, as the whole thing's entirely unbelievable, but here's what happened to me. I promise I'm not mentally unsound, though the whole thing is meant to make me sound so, when told. 


It started when I was 3 in a daycare at a Montessori school in Gainsville, FL I'd attend until 1st grade. To put it simply, this family I'm involved with has an old (and now thankfully mostly extinct) tradition of essentially match making for their children (I should mention they're very wealthy as will become apparent). I think I was told at some point it was passed down from when they were a noble family back in the day. Their transgender daughter, Sophie (according to them that's the only reason they decided to do it, as this was in the 90's) took a liking to me and thats how I was picked. Their was another boy I remember, but apparently I made the final cut there. She went to another school my first grade year to get a fresh batch of students and to ""make sure you're the one,"" according to them, then. 


Well that's not totally insane right? Here's where it gets fucked. My whole life they've paid my parents to have cameras and mics and speakers in our houses, unbeknownst to me. They've been psychoanalyzing me, in order to make sure I'm okay, I guess. But here's where it gets odder. They put you into situations, to see what you do, a kind of qualitative personality measurement if you will. For example they'll set up a scenario where you find out one coworker stole money from another, and you're the only one who knows who did it, but everyone knows it happened.


Im sure a few of you are incredulous at this point, but I promise it gets worse. And I'm sure I'll lose most of you here, unless you've been in my schools, or live in my city, or know me or them personally. To make you sound crazy is the whole point of it, but if I left it out you wouldn't totally grasp this nightmare. 


You may have noticed I included speakers into things my mother was paid to put in our family homes (as there are somehow almost everywhere I go now). Well thats because they talk to you of course! Except now its more of annoying the hell out of me, and worming their way into any aspect of my life they can. They call it ""hazing"" to try and rationalize it to me, and I can sorta understand as they've given me their daughter's heart, essentially. They have this way of speaking you can't quite hear, but you get ideas almost, instead. They give you dreams. They play the mosquito noise and binaural beats (though they havent done the latter in a while *hint* *hint* guys) while I'm trying to sleep. They have this way of playing speaking sounds over mechanical noises that makes your brain register it as the machine talking (they really love AC units) And yes they're reading this as i write it now. As my window AC unit.


The worst is what they do to you in public. Don't check out a girl's butt, they call you out as you're thinking about it. They call you a child molestor, drug addict, theif, etc. Everywhere you go. The worst part? They tell everyone you work with everything embarrassing they've seen you do, intermingled with shit they make up. (The latter is obviously to save myself some embaressment in case this is recognized though I'm sure I'm okay here) Luckily in middle and highschool I was only called a child molestor, and everyone knew I once sucked my own dick.


Now you may wonder, ""How's this all legal? They have speakers mics and cameras all over where you live? In your current home?"" It's probably not super legal, but they do have some pull apparently. I signed some papers releasing them from liability and giving them permission to monitor me in my home. That and I'm living on one of their boats. 


Why'd I say yes? Because of potential love I guess. And the fact we were childhood friends, as they moved her in and out my my schools (or me to hers in the case of where I went to 2nd-5th grade). We weren't always friends, and honestly I didnt always know who she was. (Though this was also pre-op and pre-jenner obviously so she was identified as a boy in school) I actually stole her wallet once XD. She was pretty unhappy about it.


Anywho, there's a lot of nuance to it, but most of it rides on the fact I was not privy to what was happening. How? Because I repressed it. They make you ""associate"" all your memories of the goings ons, they told me to try to make it my ""other life"" and to forget it. They aided this by scaring me as a child whenever we did anything together¬† (myself, Sophie, and her father but others were sometimes included), drugging me with nitrous and influencing my disassociated states to be nightmares, cussing and being mean, and finally by fake molesting me as a child. 


They made me put a fake penis in my mouth, I can remember the event explicitly and know it wasn't real, my mother was told it was some sort of test to see if I'd be able to say no to a doctor or some shit. I did, but the ""psychologist"" who I later found out to be Sophie's grandfather, pulled out a big knife and threatened me. I was told I had to, if I ever wanted to be with her. I was 7 when this happened, I didn't know it was fake. I was made to close my eyes and kneel, and a limp nasty thing was put in my mouth, and a few second later ""came"". Later they made me aware again of what had happened, and explained why. Naturally I was running around calling them fake child molestors all over the streets (all be it quietly) they had the perfect response. Because of course they'd been saying it all along. ""Yeah? Well you're a real child molestor."" Bastards. 


So apparently I started to repress anything to do with them. Cant imagine why. This includes literally an entire life filled with fucked up shit, including everything that would happen in my schools. Thank god. 


The last time I came back to my little Island, a few months after arrival, I thought I was crazy for a bit. Then psychic and hearing the cops. Then both. They made my loved ones tell me I was too, crazy I mean. And why wouldn't I think that? I was hearing voices! How do I know I'm not? Well they have certain people IRL reply to them on the speakers rarely. You have to remember when it happens... Because generally, no one acknowledges them, and if you do too much with others present, the people around you are supposed to look at you weird or say something. They don't always, sometimes you can't help but laugh and I'm quite a shit talker.


They had a friend of mine fake a car accident, another fake his death. They implanted people into my life, like my friend Chip, and told me about it before hand. Imagine something happening, and then remembering someone tell you it was going to happen a couple years before. Like De Ja Vu but more fucked, though they also make you relive the same days once in a while, to see if you notice. I work at a boat rental agency, and have had days the exact same people rent the exact same boats in the exact same order and do and say and wear the exact same things. Weeks apart.


There's still a lot to it I don't understand. But the last fun tidbit, and if you believed the rest, you surely won't believe this. They predicted the darknetmarkets in the early 2000's, saying there would be a way to buy drugs online. More than that they told me on my last week of ""hazing"" (or maybe month the cunts they probably said both), they'd all go down. I only remember because they told me I'd switch after the one I generally use went down, and then the next day there'd be panic, as they all would be. Now i don't know if they really are behind it, but if they are, it'll end okay. I only think its possible, because they mentioned it and the timing is right, though I don't want to give them the pleasure of truly believing. However, without raising to much disbelief hopefully, I will say I cried my eyes out the day McDonald's got rid of szechuan sauce. And they promised me. 


That's it guys. The bare bones of the test. There's an episode of The Ellen show where an English guest (its sir something as he was knighted) talks about ""the test"" including their family name (which was bleeped out when I saw it again). He says the purpose is to make you a better person, however I can't find the episode nor am I inclined to watch Ellen when I'm not forced, but I know I watched it October of last year. I know this all sounds insane, but its true. 


TL;DR: I've been watched by a rich family my whole life to make sure I'm good enough for their daughter. ",14Oct2017,1

So I've been aspiring to become a profession drummer over the past few years and since starting playing I've aimed to play 4-6 hours a day and always learn new things, work on weaknesses and also learn lots of world drumming (afro-beat, latin, calipso ect..). 

Over this summer I have networked as much as I can, playing up and down the UK on the high-streets, meeting many weird and wonderful people, who I've learned much lot from!

To me , this has been an amazing endeavour, as you're always told to ""put yourself out there"" and I always stand by ""it's not what you know, it's not who you know. It's who knows you"". So by getting out theres I'm enjoying myself, learning everyday and also creating awareness of my drumming.

16,"I'm a 19 yr old female, a sophomore at University, and I finally decided to do something with my life. Between being bipolar, anger problems and drug usage, I got concerned for myself.

If I lose, that's great! Time to learn the next step to do better. Between my BP and drug usage I felt like I was really starting to fall apart, and class work doesn't make anything easier. 
But earlier this week an RA in my university apartment came up to my buddy and I and told us about club boxing.

17,"Throughout reading this, keep in mind that family is the most important thing in my life. So this affects me in such a deep way that it is starting to physically hurt. A while back I opened my dad's phone to porn. I was incredibly uncomfortable, considering I was right next to him and it was his birthday. He acted like nothing happened and just took it away. After that, I became more cautious. I pushed myself away from him because I sort of found him disgusting, which is silly I know but he is my married 46-year-old dad. I started to secretly check his phone as often as I could, constantly hurting myself because there was always something on there that I never thought I would see on my father's phone. I became a lot closer with my mom and started to dislike my father more and more. One day when I got older I realized porn is a common thing for people to watch. I am 13 by the way. Anyways, one day, coincidentally, on his birthday again. I opened his phone and saw his google searches were ""escorts in the place we live"" or sex hotlines. This just completely fucked me over. I could hear my heart beating and I wanted to beat him. I was so angry but I had to put on a smile because it was his birthday. I cried myself to sleep that night. My dad is the one who makes money, my mother is self-employed and does not make a lot of money. Therefore, I sort of live off of my dad. If my parents were to divorce, not only would it cause me and my family incredible pain, it would ruin my entire life. So this causes me extreme anxiety as well. I decided to ignore this for a while and he has been working late recently and on a lot of business trips so I wouldn't even have the chance to go on his phone. Speaking of working late, just now I found that he has the phone numbers of two hookers near the place he works. What does that tell me about him working late? I researched them and they are fucking disgusting. I hate him. I can't talk to my mom because I cannot even bear the thought of SAYING anything to hurt her. If I talk to my dad he will either deny it or be awkward and mad. Also, I might actually hit him. If he has cheated on my mom, cheating being ANYTHING sexual with any woman other than my mother, I will completely cut him out of my life. I will move back to the country I used to live and never ever speak to him or look at him. Anyways I need help.

25,"**TLDR: Loud, noisy obnoxious kids who's parents wont be considerate and take them to one of the local parks. Our street is not a playground.**

Throughout my entire street I have obnoxious ass Asian neighbours (South Asian), I'm not racist but the way they behave is really frustrating and I can't tell if I'm overreacting or if my frustrations are warranted. By the way I am one of two white families on this street so I already feel slightly ostracised.

The first thing that really gets on my nerves is they tend to congregate outside, along the street like they're having some sort of gathering, but this happens all the time, and they'll just chat all evening which makes it pretty difficult to relax when I can just hear them all out there.

The second thing is their damn kids. Their kids play outside all day, playing football, cricket (it says no ball games on the wall as well), running around shouting and screaming noisily, riding their bikes on the path that goes along past each front door, skateboarding (the most annoying and noisy of all of the activities). The parents do nothing about this, a couple times balls have hit our car and the kids don't apologise or move the game away.

27,"Using the machine we are able to directly stimulate the pain receptors of the brain. The brain is entirely conscious, though lacking sense organs it can perceive nothing but the blistering agony we impose upon it through our experiment. It is fair to say that this would be unethical at the very least, and at most one may call it the purest, most awful torture one could possibly impose on another living being. In any sense, we can all agree that the pain we put the it through is *real*.

Next, we take a scalpel and cut away the part of the brain that stores memories, both long and short term. The brain now perceives only a moment of time, and is unable to contextualise its existence through prior experience. We press a button and stimulate the pain receptors.

Does this still qualify as pain?

Then, we cut away the part of the brain that handles logical reasoning. The brain is now a pile of instincts and pure emotion. It knows nothing. In no longer has the capability to even understand the concept of pain. We press a button and stimulate the pain receptors.

Does this still qualify as pain?

Finally, we cut away the rest of it. We remove every part of the brain except the bundle of grey matter that handles the pain response. What we are left with is literally incapable of doing anything but feel pain. We press the button and stimulate the pain receptors.

Does this qualify as pain?

Surely not, right? What we're left with can't respond to its pain. It can't react, or even change its emotional state, because it doesn't even have that. It can barely even be said to be alive at all.

My question is thus: At what point between a full and healthy brain and a meaningless jumble of nerves does the stimulation of pain receptors stop counting as real pain - and can we even claim that there any meaningful difference between the two?

35,"I kid you not. I swear I was addcited for what seemed like 3 hours... Like an actual feeling of addicition.

The suspect had stolen a white SUV and jumped out in front of me while the car was moving and taking a left turn. Saw him holding a gun and then booking it towards a Hummer and stealing it at gunpoint from someone else. The only reason I didnt get jacked was because the police were almost on his tail as they passed me on both sides including the sidewalk. The guy floored it and 90% of the cop cars chasing him hadn't even noticed him stealing the hummer so they had to take a really violent turn. By this point the adrenaline had flooded my whole brain and I was laughing maniacly (something I had no idea I would do while being in the middle of a situation like this, I guess you never know until shit hits the fan). 

I proceeded to keep on driving after all the cops had passed me and thought that was the end of it. All of a sudden a see a cop flooring it to what seemed about 150mph and whizzing by me. I stop at the next street and sure enough the guy had gone around a whole block and passed right in front of me, now followed by about 15 cop cars and going at about 100 mph...

I got even more shivery but with a huge smile on my face I couldn't erase. When I got home my dopamine rush took over and all I could think about was how jealous I was of those cops and how I was going to become one. The thought subsided just as my neurotransmitter levels got back to normal, but I feel like I got a small glimpse of what addiction to hard drugs feels like now...

41,"Eleven years ago, my eldest picked out a 5-6 year old cat at the pound for us to foster. Gracie was a good mama, and the animal shelter had been using her to foster kittens for a couple years, since she was brought in with her own litter. Loads of her fostered kittens had been adopted over the years but no one had ever taken her. After a few months, we decided that fostering wasn't enough, and Mama Gaia, as she was renamed, became part of our family. She never lacked for love and care. She mothered both kids, and several other cats. When current spouse moved in with me five years ago, she brought her cat, Rum. Gaia groomed him like a newborn kitten, much to his chagrin.

We buried her today. She passed quietly in the night. She didn't suffer. She went to sleep and let go on her own terms.

She was a goddamned good kitty. Good bye Mama Gaia. I hope when you get to the Happy Hunting Grounds, the birds are slow and the mice are fat.",14Oct2017,54
