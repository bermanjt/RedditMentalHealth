I kinda have a girlfriend but I’m back home for Christmas so we’re 5 hours apart in terms of timezone for a month, so other than talking to her, reddit, swiflie and youtube are my usual hobbies.

5,"I don't even know where to begin, or what I even want to say.

I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I'm 26 years old and have lost my entire life to debt, anxiety, depression, addiction, and self destruction. This past year has been a tipping point. I got fired from two jobs, nearly doubled my debt problem, and just feel like I'm rotting away physically and mentally. I don't even know who I am anymore..

For most of this year, I've barely found the energy or motivation to leave my apartment. Even when I try to make plans anxiety causes my stomach to feel like a stone. 

I've been in and out of therapy for depression over the years but have never been able to stick with it for various problems. Last time I was off to a great start, before losing my health insurance by getting fired.. Since then I haven't been back. 

It festers itself in the form of severe self destruction. I hear a constant voice in my head screaming at me. Threatening to kill me for being such a fuck up. I argue with myself constantly. I constantly makes the dumbest decisions and have no idea why. I put things off until they can't be fixed, I take unnecessary risks constantly. And so many opportunities I've let slip by.. seriously so many awesome opportunities that I just ignored or didn't take seriously. I can't believe some of the bridges I've burned this way..

Years of depression also have destroyed my physical health.. my hair is beginning to fall out, I'm missing many of my teeth, I never have any energy, motivation or anything.. 

I'm endlessly worrying about my debt problems. I've been seeing red flags for severe debt problems for years but me being the stubborn idiot I am I never took money planning seriously. A few credit cards, college loans, car loans, cash loans.. Fuck it's so fucking bad.. I dont know how I'm going to deal with this shit.. I'm going to lose everything eventually because of my dumbass decisions..

I'm nothing but a disappointment to everyone.. I've let my whole family down.. I've abandoned people, given up, ignored people..

i just pretend like none of its real. I just ignore it all and pretend it will go away. I feel like I'm already dead and I don't even know where I'd begin recovery.

I'm sorry this post is all over the place I have no idea what I wanted to say or write. I don't know what to talk about, I don't know what to fix, I don't know what I'm doing.. There's so much to worry about that I just shut down..  

It's never going to get better..",21Dec2017,3
6,"I used to love Christmas as a kid.  I would count down the days months ahead. It was magical.  The lights, music, atmosphere.  I live in Canada and the snow seemed to make it that much more special. Now I could give two shits. I'm 27 live alone and there is nothing in my place close to acknowledging Christmas.  I hate the consumerism surrounding it all.  Walking into stores hearing the Christmas music makes me want to walk right the fuck out. Christmas is the epitome of everything wrong with our culture. Spending money on shit we don't need just for the sake of spending money.  Most of the shit we are buying comes from sweat shop factories where some poor souls are working 16 hours a day for next to nothing.  How the fuck did the birth of Jesus Christ turn to this?

11,"I know who you are, you sellout. I remember all the conversations we had. I know the only reason you changed your mind is because eventually there's nothing else to do but bring another life into the world and start inflicting it with pointless suffering, no matter how well off you are or how good of genetics your child inherits.

Most people I can just say congratulations to. But I can't be dishonest with you. It will kill me inside. But the best thing I can think of to say is that it'll keep you busy for a while. Which is the happiest medium I can muster, and I still know won't be good enough for either party, considering how deep we went. I know what this is. You know how I feel about it.

Adult life is censorship. I've never been so upset.  Proper conversation doesn't happen anymore.  Everyone fluffing each other or you're mentally ill.

I'm not mad.  I just wish I could talk with you properly for five minutes again.  But everyone keeps going deeper in denial territory... like so many people simultaneously recognize youth was the best time of life, while actively denying everything they did during it because it was so good.

Why is this so depressing.  At most it shouldn't make me feel anything at all.  Everyone changes their mind.  Nothing is sacred.  Nothing matters.  If you aren't having kids what are you doing here.  And if you have kids you're more than a bit of a jerk.  Say say say and commit and then flip just like that... why listen to anything anyone has to say.  Just temporary noise filling otherwise meaningless air.  But since people change so quickly from panic responses.  The noise is just meaningless air as well.

I really wish I could be happy for you.

I am disappointed in myself as well.  I am also a sellout, though for different reasons.  Once we wake up to mortality... everything is ruined.",21Dec2017,1
13,"We were supposed to be getting clean together. It started off so well; outpatient rehab for six months, recovery meetings and church and supporting each other... But first he relapsed. He was gone without a trace for four days and I was wrecked by it. But I learned things like how I can stay clean and hold down the fort while he figures himself out, and I did that. I waited so patiently for him to come home; I worked myself out and I didn't yell at him or give him guilt or shame. I don't dump all of my nasty feels on his head because I figured he's working through his own garbage, he doesn't need extra. Even though it sucked harder for me than I was prepared to weather, I freaking weathered that and embraced my prodigal husband. Then he did it again, at the worst possible time, and again I worked myself out and didn't scream at him even though I had so much screaming inside of me. I already have abandonment issues, those predated him, they are half-why I ever did drugs to begin with. But I again embraced him. I made it okay to come home when he did. I didn't make a thing out of the thing he'd made. And we moved on sort of. And then again! He left me again! To smoke meth without me for another 4 days while I had no idea where he was! And that wrecked me like it always had before, but I stayed sober... Like I always had before. And I keep thinking we're over all of that, but that's silly. He keeps going away and I keep staying the course and it keeps sucking me dry and here I sit broken again. Again! Why does he get to do drugs and I have to sit here inside of our uncomfortable life which, by the way, is totally about to get better... It just sucks for a minute‽  I don't know what to do with myself. I think that the worst part for me is how I know that when he comes home, coming down, he'll pick the most egregious of fights so that he can distract me from remembering that he screwed up. I always pay for his sins, usually physically, until he gets his head back on. I don't freaking have that coming. I DON'T HAVE THAT COMING! But what am I going to do, leave him? No! I can't fix him, I can't solve this, I can't affect this, I can't leave him, I won't leave him, I'm stuck, and it sucks. I hate how this feels. I hate how bad I want to go smoke fucking drugs with him!  What am I supposed to do? I'm so uncomfortable. Whatever the lesson is, I hope I get it.",21Dec2017,3
15,"Getting close to new years and I'm not totally sure on what I want to do of the two options I have. On one hand I could go back to my home town and spend it with my family, but I'm not a massive fan of the idea since I don't really want to be in my home town for longer than I have to be. The other option is going to a party with some friends but I feel like it was a bit of a reluctant invite out of them since the party's at a friend of theirs that I don't know, and besides I don't really want to go through the hassle of meeting a bunch of new people.

All in all I couldn't be more fed up with the winter holidays this year and it's barely even started, I'm just thinking of telling each group I'm doing the opposite, staying in my place, drinking, watching some good movies, listening to some good music etc. Is that sad? Either way I guess I'll just decide closer to the time.",21Dec2017,4
16,"There's so much I need to get off my chest that I don't even know where to begin. I've felt so alone and unhappy for 3 years now. At first, I thought it was just a temporary phase but it's definitely not anymore.

For background, I'm 21 years old and going into my last semester of college.

Nothing's been going right in my life for the last few years. Career-wise, I feel like I'm at a dead end. Applying for summer internships last year was a bust - I ended up interning for a company I had no interest in as a last resort. Applying for full-time jobs this year has been a failure so far. In total (internships included), I must've applied for over 300 positions and still nothing. I don't know why. I'm a strong student with what I thought were great credentials (2 internships, part of an investment club managing $400k, independent research under 2 different professors, honors, clubs, volunteering, technical skills). I've been constantly working on my resume and even had help from my university's career center and recruiters. I've reached out to my alumni network. Still nothing. I became so numb to getting rejected. I even considered going back to school for a completely new degree because I was getting nowhere with what I'm doing now. I feel like I worked so hard for nothing.

Social life. Friends--I wouldn't say I have that many. I don't have any close friends, no one I feel comfortable sharing all this to - that's why I'm here sharing my story with internet strangers. I was reserved and socially awkward in high school but I tried really hard to change that going into college. I really tried improving my social skills. I tried making more friends and I was successful in the sense that I met more people but I don't have a close relationship with any of them. In college, I've had at least 3 people straight up tell me that I'm really awkward; each time made me feel like shit because I felt like I made no progress and all my efforts were worthless. Every break I've had in college, I'm just home most of the time because no one ever talks to me or asks to hang out. I see my other ""friends"" hanging out together on Snapchat but I don't remember the last time I was ever invited. Even while college is in session, I find myself home most of the time when I'm not working, in class or studying.

My romantic life is non-existent. I've never been in a real relationship. I wanted to meet someone so badly that even though I said I never would, I started using dating apps (Tinder, CMB). I've only met up with one person. We just ended up hooking up once and I didn't even feel good about it. The other 99% of the time, I never get past 3 text messages with my matches - they just end up never responding. Meanwhile, my 3 housemates and most of my friends are in relationships so I just feel even worse about myself. I'm at that point where I'm legitimately scared I'll end up dying alone. I know I'm only 21 but I haven't met a girl that I've texted for hours for 3 years now.

When all this shit comes together in my head, I feel so bad about myself and my life. Everything's so difficult and I feel worthless. I've accomplished nothing and I have no one to turn to. I did shrooms thinking it would enlighten me or make me a happier person (lol, I know). The shrooms just made me think more and triggered an existential crisis that took me a month to get out of. But I still feel so numb and I can't even enjoy anything in my life anymore because I feel so broken down. I lost over $8,000 gambling and trading options (a very very large chunk of my money) recently but I didn't even feel a thing. I did shrooms again last month for the feeling but after I came down from the trip, I just layed there and was so depressed. I started having suicidal thoughts - everything would be over if I just ended it. I don't think I'm the kind of person who would actually commit suicide but I don't know what I'll be like in a year from now. The fact that these thoughts even crossed my mind scare me. 

I don't even think all this text even begins to grasp how I feel. I feel like I'm floating in outer space by myself. Sorry for the essay and thanks if you read all the way through. I don't know what I'm looking for out of this... I'd appreciate any guidance because I really don't know anymore. I really want to be happy.",21Dec2017,11

20,"So the last few months I've been supporting a friend. We've had a few outings and activities. They have really helped him out and stopped him isolating himself. They helped me too as I was recovering from my own depression. Plus they are fun to do and it's great to have people to hang out with.

However, yesterday he sent me a message saying that I unintentionally pull him away from doing something really stupid by being nice.

I don't know what to think about. To me I feel like it's making me feel responsible for his actions. Am I overthinking this? Am I supposed to feel nice and warm? I've had a bad experience in the past from a guy who really did try to make me feel responsible and it sent me damn near crazy. This is giving me flashbacks, so I don't know if I'm thinking clearly.",21Dec2017,6

23,"Today, my girlfriend and I had plans to go out on a date and eat at our favorite sushi restaurant and visit some Christmas lanes. Today was special because it’s been a while since we’ve hung out. On  the way there, all kinds of bad signs kept appearing. Multiple traffic stops due to people having issues with vehicles. Frequent pullovers and emergency vehicles. Very strange night but we shrugged it off and thought of it as just that. When we arrived, my girl and I decided to smoke a bowl right before to enjoy with the food. Sometimes we smoke before eating something as we like to enjoy it better. Not too regular but every once in a while. I was probably a 7 after we got done smoking. Thinking back, I should of cooled down an extra 20 mins to relax but we were both really hungry and decided to go. We sit at a booth and immediately start picking treys off the belt. Super delicious. Everything was going well when all of a sudden, 2 treys in, I have a random seizure.

My vision started getting very shaky and slowly my eyes started closing and closing but I had no way of controlling it. I felt like I was still talking to my girl and just staring off watching a college football game when next thing I know, I’m on the floor with staff and people standing on top. I look at my girl and she’s sitting there crying scared. I had no idea what happened but I felt fine and awake. I layed there hoping it would get better and waited for water. The people and staff helped me by sitting me up right and giving me water to drink. All very scary as I’ve never had any serious medical issues. No seizure history or nothing. Only thing I worry about is pollen allergies during the Spring. Nothing else. 

I became very calm for a minute and sweaty a bit but I felt fine and awake until I started getting another shaky vision. My girlfriend says that the first seizure was around 30 seconds. Second was around 10. I wake up with people helping and they had an ambulance on the way. Fuck but whatever, I needed the medical attention. 

Paramedics arrive and load me on to the ambulance. Had low blood pressure on the way there but it might of been due to my stress and worries about the incident. Not sure on that. I tell them what happened and my history and they tell me it’s kind of a mystery why that would happen. I am semi fit with a good eating schedule but on this night, I was a bit sleep deprived and hadn’t ate in a long time due to waiting and sleeping. 

Time passes and I’m in a hospital room with my girlfriend and mother. I’ve never been so scared in my life thinking what financial issues and relationship problems this might cause. Before this, life has never been so sweet. I thought it was all a nightmare. Thankfully my family and girlfriend supported me and gave me comfort through this but I just can’t help myself knowing I might never be the same anymore. It scarred me knowing I’m always going to remember sitting in the room with them thinking of all the things that could happen. At one point, I even admitted to both telling them I might be depressed from this as I have had a history with depression and suicidal thoughts. That is long gone now but those same feelings came back tonight. I wanted to wake up from this knowing it was all ok. Nothing happened.

Thankfully, Doctors found nothing wrong with the tests. Might have been my deprivation and appetite but I don’t buy it. I hope it is but I’m just acting worried right now. 

Now I’m at home unable to sleep. I have my girl and my puppy laying both right next to me. I can’t stop thinking of the events that happened before we arrived. I scared my girlfriend so much. It kills me knowing this might damage me for the worse. With hospital bills coming soon and right during the holiday, I just hope everything from now on can help me get through this.

Coming from depression, I never had such a good life with my girlfriend and family. It was almost like a fairytale but now it’s just life kicking me in the back telling me this shit is real. I just hope I can cope through this without thinking of anything worse. Right now I can’t seem to forget about it. I just want to let this off. Thank you.",21Dec2017,2

29,"He’s in a hospital 2 hours away slowly dying.  He could pass today, tomorrow, the next day... no one knows for sure.  He’s on comfort measures, so I know his nursing staff will take care of him if he’s in pain or is anxious, so that makes me feel good.  He’s in and out of lucid consciousness. 

We went to see him last Saturday, and I feel good about the way that visit ended. I don’t think I need a last goodbye or anything.  But the thought of him dying alone makes me really sad.  Yet if I go visit him now, it’s not likely I’ll actually be there the moment he dies anyway. What can I do? 

He was such a good man to us, and when I was a kid he was my best buddy.  He made me feel important and loved.  I want to return the favor, and I don’t want him to be alone.  Yet at the same time, I know that he would want me to be living my life, enjoying this time around the holidays with my family and my son... 

Maybe I will gather up some photographs and flowers, some chocolates and coffee (if he can even eat or drink) and other things he has always enjoyed, make the two hour drive, make his room pretty and familiar and comfortable, sit with him for a bit, and then say goodbye. ",21Dec2017,2

31,"I have been having a horrid time dealing with abuse from my co workers. They are both in their 40s and have been in their positions 5+ years. I am 24 and joined the company a year ago and now work along side them. I do my best but I am not perfect. We do receiving and there are many small security and fine detail measures to remember with paperwork, locks, vendors, and so on. They refuse to talk to me anymore unless necessary. They have openly and not so openly said venomous and degrading things about me. They have called me every name in the book, insulted my work ethics, called me sensitive when I bring up the issues I have with them. Many people around the company feel pity for me for having to work beside them as they are notorious around the store.

I have followed the book when trying to resolve these problems. I have brought it up to them as nicely as I can, I have spoken to our manager, I have spoken to the security manager, I have spoken to another store co manager and the actual store manager and personel. Nothing is getting done and things are not changing. I come from a long line of physical labor jobs with large groups of men who often settle differences with shouting match or a few shoves if it is really bad and we get over it. This verbal abuse and trying to be better than my previous jobs at handling this situation has been infuriating. I just want to lash back and lay down some real anger like they do.

I told my boss that signing those papers to accept the position has been the biggest mistake I have made at the company. She stopped me in my tracks and said that I have been doing a phenominal job and their attitude has been like that since day 1. Finally. Someone in power who knows and sees what is going on. She gave me a sly look and said she needed someone who can dish that attitude right back to them to get it to stop. My eyes popped open and I said I can totally do that. She told me to keep it low and fight back. I plan on it.

 If things get brought up and we actually do have a sit down talk with managers about behavior and I am somehow in the wrong after this I have a plan. We can also talk about unauthorized keys to bay doors that they have. We can also talk about the massive amount of company time stolen from 15 minute breaks that turn into 45 minutes. Security and theft are no laughing matters. Lets talk about actively hindering a fellow employee who is trying to learn and grow. Sure, lets have a sit down talk about attitude and see what we can do. This has been a big build up on me and I needed somewhere to let it out.

32,"I had a close friend in high school, she was a year younger than me but a bit more childlike and impressionable. We drifted apart when I was 17.

Recently, I got curious about what she's up to and googled her. I found her tumblr and it's full of pictures and quotations of Hitler as well as pictures of various kinds of military stuff, and aparently she thinks Hitler did what needed to be done to save a country in crisis.

Then I remembered a conversation we had: She had mentioned that a friend of hers had given her some reading on the atrocities committed by the Zionists. She was an antitheist at the time, and to be honest so was I, so I didn't argue against it as hard as I could have. Now every time I remember it I feel guilty.

The worst part is she's now a history student, so there's a non-zero chance she'll be a history teacher and pass her ideas down to other young and impressionable minds.",21Dec2017,4
34,"Before I start my story let me give you some background: I'm hispanic and could pass as Arabic, my girlfriend is a white pretty Swedish girl. I love taking pictures of industrial things. Yesterday my girl and I drove past a really big refinery that is the most photogenic thing I've seen in a while, I got so excited that I pulled to the side and started taking pictures. Suddenly we were surrounded by three cars, an officer and two federal agents come out. The officer pulls me to the side and after very rudely asking me weird and personal questions such as ""did you kidnap her? What's your religion?"" While the other two were asking my girl if I hit her. I was honestly confused at first, but then they pointed out that I was trespassing. Fair enough. But then it got weird and uncomfortable. One of them asked me to delete the pictures in front of him and I remembered that I had just taken naked pictures of my girl that morning. I asked if I could delete personal pictures first and he wouldn't let me. So I delete all the pictures I took at the factory, which shows my girlfriend's nude right after (who was being held away from me scared out of her mind standing outside the car.) He let one of the agents know there are ""pornographic images"" in the camera, then that other agent asked to look at every picture on my camera to make sure I didn't take any more ""illegal pictures"". I had no choice, given that they kept saying they had enough reason to send me to federal prison. I was trying to scroll through them fast and he asked me to slow down and get on a better area to look at them better. I was furious because my girl was naked in most of them, and my poor girl didn't know these guys were checking out her nudes while she was nearly crying being interrogated like a criminal by another officer. After I was done scrolling the officer said ""nice..."" like a horny old man, and this made me really fucking furious. After they searched my car and found nothing, I was told I'm going to be watched for seven months. After nearly an hour of interrogation and making a copy of my documents and my girlfriend's documents they let us go. But to be frank we felt violated. I don't feel like everything they did was legal or justified. Is there anything I can do? I don't want to let this go. ",21Dec2017,12
35,"The leash goes both ways.

We forget that. In our arrogance and our closed-mindedness, we forget that the dog on the other end of the leash has its own feelings, its own desires, and its own free will.

In today's modern world, most people do not fail to meet the basic requirements for keeping a dog alive. They feed it, give it water, and meet its other basic needs but there is a huge difference between living and thriving.

Sure, we may be able to compel our dogs to do what we want. We may be able to successfully get them to pee and poo outside and not inside. We may offer them SOME affection, but it doesn't mean that they are living a quality life.

The leash is not a substitute for a real connection.

It's hard work, diving deep into our minds and souls, seeking to improve the quality of our relationships with our loved ones. (Human and not human!) It's easy to glide along the surface of things and maintain a relationship or a life that’s simply “Good enough.”

In our arrogance, we may consider ourselves superior to dogs. We may think we see all of what the dog has to offer and believe that there is not much to them. We often fail to see the full spectrum of their body language. We’re too quick to label our dogs as “lazy” or “disobedient” or “aggressive.” We fill the gaps of our knowledge with fear, clinging to the illusion of safety that comes from pointing the finger at something else rather than ourselves. Or, on the other end of the spectrum, we fill the gaps with smugness, believing that we already know enough, and that we know for certain what our dogs are thinking, curving the idea of working harder for them and us.

Dogs undoubtedly need leadership and structure to flourish, but too many people get caught up in the idea that ""Dominance"" should be the cornerstone of our relationship. We incorrectly perceive innocent dog behaviors as some sort of threat to our authority. We think “Oh, but I can’t let him get away with that!” too often. We’re too ready to make a corrective action after an unwanted behavior has been done, rather than empathize with our dogs and learn where the behavior comes from and why.

Just yesterday during lunch, I checked my dog webcam that I use to check on Max at home, only to see him on the couch tearing a magazine to shreds. He’s not “supposed” to be doing this (which really means I just don’t WANT him to do that.) The play pen fence that I set up for him while we’re at work blocks him from mostly everything in the living room except for part of the couch. He’s never done it before, but he did it now.

It upset me to see it. Thoughts rushed my head worrying me that he might get into something that he could choke on, he might eat something that makes him sick, he might chew on a electrical cord and get shocked, etc. I asked my supervisor for some time to go home and stop it before it got worse.

I’m certain that a more immature version of me would have driven over to him in anger. I would have opened the door prepared to release my rage over such “disobedience.” I would have yelled at him, scolded him, and left home still in a sour mood with Max a bit confused as to what all of that was even about.

Thankfully, this did not happen.

See, Max does not know that he's not allowed on the couch because he's never been taught otherwise. My dog does not know that magazines are not proper chewing material. I knew ahead of time, that one day he'd test his boundaries and that he already has the leg power to hop onto the couch with ease.

The drive home granted me the time to meditate and reflect on my own feelings. I realized that to take my anger out on Max would be unjust. For it was not him I was mad at, it was mostly at myself.

I am grateful for that time and awareness because when I opened the door, there was my puppy. His tail was wagging and his front paws were bouncing up in excitement as I walk through the front door towards him.

I walked over to the couch with the shredded magazine, held up a scrap, looked at him and said “NO.” with a deliberately unpleasant tone.

I saw his ears move back against his head, his head lower a little, and his body slightly tense at this. To me, this body language told me that he understood my emotional state, I was not happy, and all this happened in just two seconds. And then…

That was it. I let it go. I cleaned some of the mess, arranged the play pen to block him from the couch, sat down, and called Max to me.

I see his ears relax, his body loosen up, and his tail begin a soft wag. I smile and ensure my own body language is relaxed and happy as he comes close to greet me with a myriad of kisses, the same way he always greets me when I get home. I tell him that I love him with my words and my actions. I pet him lovingly, let him know in my own human way that I forgive him, and that it I appreciate him for showing me where I need to improve as a leader.

I left him sadly because I never want to be apart from him, but overall very happy that I handled the situation in a way that was calm and understanding—a way that was fair for Max.

I sometimes laugh at the irony that I, expecting my first (human) child with my girlfriend, put so much effort into learning more about dogs, reading about dogs, and thinking frequently on how I can improve my relationship with my dog.

The thing is, I am not ashamed in the least.

In fact, I'm proud.

These very same qualities of mine, the qualities the compel me to be a better me for the sake of another living being, are the qualities that I know I will tap into when I begin raising my child.

Raising a child will also require me to take a good look at myself and work daily to improve. It will require me to view my child with patience, empathy, and a TON of love.

I’m not saying it will be easy and I am well aware of the big differences between the two, but I am proud because I know that this feeling that I have inside of me, a feeling that I can’t accurately put into words, is largely influenced by love.

The quality effort you make and the love you share with others comes back to you.

Dogs, for me, are a blessing because they love with all their hearts. They demonstrate an undying loyalty and tje capability for forgiveness far beyond what I once thought was possible.

I owe it to my pup to give him the best life possible and to show him love beyond measure. You know, the same love he always shows me. 🐶 ❤️",21Dec2017,7

37,"I have to wait until the first of the year to find out if 

a. I have Cancer. That's the biggie.

b. If I can or Can't have anymore children. (doctor leaning towards not)

c. If I'm going to have to have surgery (this is a huge factor in the can or can't have kids bit)

So how am I supposed to just act casual when my whole future is hanging in the balance. Cancer is a very scary word and I know that sounds dramatic, but I'm 29 years old. I was supposed to have more time to decide on kids. I just can't seem to stay busy or distracted enough not to break down in tears daily. I just want this all to be over, I don't want to keep pretending everything is fine, I don't want to keep acting like I'm not terrified. I'm exhausted. ",21Dec2017,4
39,"I'm a straight guy who has no interest in pursuing a relationship with a woman, despite not being asexual. The first time I heard about MGTOW, I imagined it was a community to discuss and share experiences of simply being single and staying that way for good.

Boy I was wrong... It's not just the blatant sexism and hate, their stance completely clashes with my lifestyle, life experience and political views, it’s hard to wrap my head around it, and frankly, most “stories” shared about interaction with women seem fabricated (and very, almost stereotypically US-centric).

So what alternatives are there?

But anyway. I'm in the UK, recently moved out of my home country. Family's accumulated debt and I inherit all of that, no chances of it ever being paid off unless a miracle happens.

I could pursue university here, but I've no subjects I'm interested in, and I don't want to get into even more future debt taking up a course that has low odds of getting me a career. My grades back home weren't bad, but Maths specifically is average (C specifically) so I won't be able to get into a Comp Sci course. 

I could go back home again, but I don't have any place to stay long-term (more than a month) and if I enrol in a uni there, even then the qualifications I'll get would only be taken seriously in my home as it's a third world country, and I can't stay there because I'll have people breathing down my neck trying to sue me in a few years because of debt, more than likely.

I could speak to my mother about it, and she can certainly try to pay them off, but that leaves my dad who in 19 years I've only spoken to once and he didn't seem like he really gave a shit in the slightest other than holding a grudge against my mother. With that said, I have no idea what he's accumulated and I'd like to stay optimistic, but thinking that he's a rational person with no debt seems unrealistic.

I'm just wondering if maybe there's a way out of this that I'm not seeing. When I say I'd like a comfortable life I mean not living in a shared flat and not hating my job and myself every time I come home from work and wondering why I'm putting in so much effort just to keep existing and being miserable.

And that's that. Keep in mind, I'm not looking solely for positive feedback. If you think I should just suck it up, tell me. That'll at least kill off any false hope.

By the way my home country is Bulgaria, for anyone wondering.

43,"Hey r/self,

Back story: My best friend who was very successful before meeting his current girlfriend has become financial and emotionally dependent.  Since they have gotten together, my best friend calls me up every 3-4 months (like clockwork) with a discussion on whether or not he should break up with this girl or not.  Each time conversation has the same conclusion, he does not see a future with her, is not attracted to her, but is too afraid to break it off because he insists that she will destroy his career opportunities (she has done this in previous relationships), especially since he has already 'wasted her time' (biologically speaking).  At the end of the call, he always comes to the same conclusion: break it off now. A week after each call, I find out he does the complete opposite and progresses the relationship to the next step.  As a reminder, this pattern repeats itself every 3-4 months like clockwork since they got together.

His mother also feels like there's something strange going on and has told him her concerns, which he replied to in anger and further isolation.

Today, I receive a text from him that he is going to ask her father for her hand in marriage.  Timing? 3.5 months since our last cyclical conversation.  Unfortunately, I predicted this turn of events in the first call we had after hearing several big red flags and told him about what was going to happen.  He agreed with me, but the pattern continued.

What can I do?  I am sincerely concerned about him and his future.

TL;DR: Best friend is getting manipulated into marriage, told me that he is going to ask her father for her hand in marriage this week.",21Dec2017,6

45,"Every time I do something wrong, my conscience festers at me for days and days and days... 

When I apologize to the victim of my wrongdoing, I still feel awful like our relationship has some how changed. 

I stay up late at night thinking about every outcome that could've happened. 

When people bring up the wrong doing this anxiety comes back and seemingly worse.

47,"Long story short, i have a friend im very close too. We are both girls, im gay, she is straight but has stated she thinks she is bisexual but prefers men. Anyways, we fooled around a few times and kissed many times. We are both in our mid twenties by the way.

I ended up liking her, but she claims to not feel the same. Slept in the same bed etc... then we'd put up boundaries and she'd break them. Again we'd get into arguments because she doesn't feel the same way. And the cycle repeats.

At one point she got very mean with me, really put me down, insulting me when I wouldn't even claim to like her anymore. We made up, worked through it and I went to therapy because of her. She was so mean to me and manipulated me, and made me feel like everything was my fault. I went to therapy and she went away for four months. I got over her and kept communication at a minimum. I was very happy.

She came back this week and we became physical again. She even made comments that we were more than friends. I didn't dwelve into it knowing the arguments it caused. And how often shed say she doesnt feel the same. I just enjoyed being physical with her cuddling and such. I brought her to a spa to where she initiated getting physical and cuddly with me. She made comments how we were the only lesbian couple there, how romantic it is. That night we cuddled again and got close at her place. 

She made plans to hang out with me but i was busy with a friend, we made plans to hang out the next day. To which she canceled that something came up.

I call her the next day and she is upset at me that we broke the boundaries. She blames me, also says she feels i took advantage of her. I told her if it bothered you why didn't you say anything? She's like I know but in the moment I shouldve, i was shy. Says i touched her boob when i was asleep, when I obviously was cuddling her and had no idea. Says she is not at fault for crossing the boundaries.

I couldnt continue the conversation because i had to go to work. She told me to call her in the evening and she never responded. I didn't hear from her. 

I felt anxious, upset and sad that she blames me and that she makes a problem out of nothing. I feel like she is making me feel bad and bringing back the shit we had when i had to go to therapy. The self blame she makes me feel.

What to do?",21Dec2017,3

49,"Christmas growing up was always nice. Lots of family to see, lots of gifts and games for everyone. Later on in life Afghanistan and Iraq changed that feeling. Three times I was in one of those countries during Christmas. I found myself burying those feelings of happiness because I was away from what I knew. I learned to suppress feelings of joy and I created a new path of thought. Sure I was with people close to me but it wasn't the same and I wasn't always with someone. 

I have started to notice my emotional state coming down during this time of year, like clockwork. Even though I am going to see lots of family I still have this carved path inside of me. At times I don't see the joy in it because I remember how little I had in these times, but I still had appreciation for what I had. This cognitive dissonance is a strange one. ",21Dec2017,1
