6,"Like in every area of my life I'm always just waiting. I don't know what for. It's like I expect life to hit me with these big moments that never come. It's like that quote from The Wire, if anyone has ever watched it, 'A life Jimmy, you know what that is? It's the shit that happens while you're waiting for moments that never come'. It sums up my entire life. I feel like a spectator just watching my life unfold, powerless to change it in anyway and just hoping some cosmic force is gonna make things a bit better.

I'm doing a degree that has no career prospects and that I don't even overly enjoy cause I have no idea what I want to do with my life and I'm just buying time until 'it hits me'. While I talk to girls pretty regularly when I'm out and we get along well, I never take the next step to really get to know someone and talk to them daily cause I'm scared of what might happen, and instead I wait for someone who's gonna make every move towards me instead. I have a job that I dislike, but I'm not gonna quit cause every other job I could get with my experience would be equally shitty and I kind of like the people I work with. Better just to wait it out and hope something better comes up down the road. I kinda want to travel, but have no concrete plans. I have a slight interest in comedy, but I'd never make it so no point. I kind of want to write something, or go to the gym, or buy new clothes, or start reading, but none of it ever gets done cause I sit waiting on the motivation to do any of it that never fucking comes.

My entire life is a waiting game. I sit and fantasise and wait on these big moments, hoping my life will be transformed. I imagine meeting some girl I like when I'm out and we share some perfect night and completely fall for each other. I imagine sitting and just realising all of a sudden where I want my life to go, and giving everything I have to reach that goal. I think of having crazy adventures and a catalogue of memories I've made. But when I look back, I realise I've made the wrong choices and missed opportunities I really could have taken. I could have not went to college and took a gap year to figure out what I wanna do. I could have messaged that girl I liked regularly and built something. I could have wrote a story I had an idea from. I could have went to a comedy club, or looked for a new job, or bought new clothes. I could have done all this shit. But instead I wait. And while I wait and reflect I realise that time's just passing me by faster and faster. But I've already missed so many opportunities and made myself so unhappy with where I am that I'm frozen into inaction and feel forced to sit and wait for something, anything to make my life mean something. But nothing's ever gonna come, only I can give my life meaning, but all I wanna do is sit and wait instead. ",17May2017,195
7,"Hello everyone,      

I've been with my SO for the past 2 years and it's been going great. But out of no where, it's gone completely down hill. When we argue, we argue over small, petty things that turn in fights that last a whole day. There's two sides of this. When I tell her something, and when she tells me something. When I tell her, she doesn't listen to what I have to say and gets mad at me, and we argue. When she tells me something, I have to continually ask her whats wrong as I just want to get over our problems as I hate it lurking for a whole day as it ruins my day, not to mention her attitude throughout the day. In any case, she won't tell me at all, and it becomes like a child and mouse game with her as she won't tell me what's wrong until I get completely pissed off and annoyed by her acting like this. By the time she begins to speak, I get way pissed off and begin to raise my voice and she will tell me to stop being angry and impatient. By that, I get even more pissed off as I usually wait a whole day for her to say something. Here is an example of our last fight, last night.          

At around 9am, she said ""How much would you pay for sex from me?"" I jokingly said ""$1"", to which she got mad. I told her sorry immediately, but instead of listening to what I had to say, about why I said it jokingly, she became mad. I hugged her at the same time, but she pushed me into the wall which seriously hurt my neck. I get pissed off by this and begin to hold her arms and body so she wouldn't hurt me more. She continued to be pissed off throughout the day and I continued to ask her whats wrong so she would talk with me. At around 4pm, she tells me why she's so pissed off. But by that time, I'm to annoyed by her attitude and for me having to ask her continuously for whats wrong. In spite, I told her that she shouldn't ask me that kind of question, especially since it's not something someone usually asks, especially to their boyfriend. Fast forward to 1am. We're still arguing and she tells me how much of a POS I am for saying that. I tell her i'm sorry for saying that, but she blames me that I didn't even say anything. She gets up and tries to get out of the house. Admittedly, this is where I go wrong. I pull her arm and throw her onto the bed so she would just go to sleep. She gets pissed off by this and claws me with her nails. I get even more pissed off so I get on top of her so she can't move and hold her arms against the bed so she would stop clawing me. At the same time, I punched her leg and arm since she kicked me in the stomach. As we're doing this, I tell her to stop so we can talk about it the next morning. She stops momentarily, and then runs out of the house around 3am. I have to run after her and grab her and pick her up by her legs and bring her back to the room. I get even more pissed off by this that I slap her in the head, throw her on the bed, and then get on top of her again. This lasts until 5am to which we both get tired and fall asleep. Next morning we wake up around 11am. The same argument continues but instead of continuing to fight, we began to talk. We began talking about what happened and what was wrong. We never came to a conclusion and still are arguing right now.   

In any case, I know I'm completely at fault for loosing my cool for being physically and mentally abusive to her and I completely feel wrong for doing so. But what can I do? What should I do? If I seek a therapist and tell them everything, will they call the police on me or notify law enforcement? I'd really like to fix myself and this relationship.

14,"... but TBH, no matter how often they replay the footage of the minister's reaction as 'proof' of this, what I see is a guy just genuinely shocked to learn that the US president just fired the leading investigator while being investigated himself on his ties to Russia. 

I mean, **I'm not even calling Ockham's Razor here**... to me, Lavrov's reaction just does not look sarcastic at all. Now, if after his 'You're kidding!', he had had a big grin on his face, sure, that to me would come off as sarcasm. But instead, when the press person confirmed, Lavrov rolled his eyes, turned around, and shook his head, mumbling to his assistant... again, like someone genuinely shocked/concerned about the newest tomfoolery from the WH. 

Am I the only one who completely misses the US media's interpretation of Lavrov's reaction? Is this a cultural thing? (I'm not a US resident, instead from a European country closer to Russia both geographically and culturally than the US is.)

32,"I've been teaching English in South Korea for almost two years. I have this one student who I've taught off and on for the past year (the students switch teachers every three months or so because we're a private academy) and the changes I've noticed in him have really disturbed me. 

For one thing, until fairly recently I was under the impression that he was at least two years younger than he actually is. He is much shorter and smaller than other students his age, leading me to believe he was only first or second grade but is really in fourth. His parents push him constantly in terms of academics (on top of normal school, he goes to our English academy as well as separate music and math academies) and he has told me, more than once, that he only sleeps two or three hours a night. When he comes to my class, he will almost immediately fall asleep within two or three minutes of class beginning. He will jolt himself awake long enough to write something down, read something or answer a question and then will almost immediately fall asleep again.

I taught him about a year ago and I remember him being kinda quiet and shy but overall a fairly normal kid. He would answer questions voluntarily, he would discuss how his day went when I asked, and his speaking and writing skills were developing at a pretty good rate.

Cut to a year later and every time I see this kid I want to cry. He barely speaks, he doesn't acknowledge any other students and he doesn't have even a basic idea what our lessons are about. His speaking is just a monotone, jumbled mess of any word he happens to think of at the time. Nothing I say to him really seems to register anymore. He'll answer a question incorrectly, I'll tell him it's wrong, and he'll sit there quietly for a second before just repeating the exact same thing he already said. The other day during class I looked at him and he was just staring at me with a frozen expression. I kinda moved in front of him to try to get his attention and he didn't even follow my gaze. His eyes were completely lifeless. It took him a few moments to realize I was even speaking to him.

There are bi-lingual instructors at my school who talk to the parents and nearly ever week we talk about how worried were are about this kid. His parents don't seem willing to acknowledge anything we tell them; they just keep pushing him more and more. South Korea has a disturbingly high student suicide rate and I'm serious when I say I lay awake some nights worried about what's going to happen when he reaches middle school.

I don't know what to do, and I'm not really looking for advice. Just needed to say this stuff to anyone else.",17May2017,34
34,"My living situation has been.. interesting.. for years. My mother raised me as a single mother after escaping my abusive father, moved across many states to live with, then near, her parents. My grandfather died when I was four, which made my mental instability - that had started when I was eighteen months old, so I've been told - much, much worse. I started counseling then, and continued more or less until I was 17, though the reasons varied - there's been much abuse of literally every kind at varied times, but most of it was emotional, from my mother and grandma. I was, and still am, very codependent; I've been diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder, which made me rely on my mother for.. well, everything. I've never really been able to function well in the 'real world' between that, my anxiety, my PTSD. I shut down, especially when overstressed, which happens unfortunately easily. So, despite trying, I've never even been able to get a job, much less see if I can hold one. I had been drawing disability as a teen for my mental issues, but I eventually lost that due to an error when I was around twenty, and unfortunately my mother never appealed in time so I had to reapply. That process has been difficult and not gone so well, and unfortunately the effort sort of.. fizzled out, the past couple years. I have no idea what to do, or what step to take now, or anything now that mum is dead. She handled everything.. EVERYTHING, when it came to any sort of 'business' type stuff, for me and my grandmother (who was in the process of going into hospice when mum died, and now I'm being told I need to handle all of that for her).

Alzheimer's has been a plague on this family since I was eight years old. Mum had heart problems, ended up needing a five way bypass, which took so many hours she had early onset Alzheimer's because of it. And despite her making damn sure I knew she almost died, and could at any time (and started my nightmare of waking up to find her dead, which started an obsession of every day, first thing after waking up, I checked to ensure she was still breathing, still alive), she never actually prepared for the chance of her ACTUALLY dying. She acted like she'd just keep going, keep living, despite everything... 

By the time she died, our finances were crap. While she dealt with business, that was about all she could do, and she needed an increasing amount of help with.. everything, really. Even sleeping, by the end. By the time I was fifteen, I was basically her caretaker, even as she was my guardian - in the legal sense, which essentially never went away, even after I was an adult. It wasn't legally required anymore, but much of the paperwork for such was done, etc. But as she aged, and got worse, she needed more help. By about five or so years ago,I couldn't do it alone anymore, so not long after my long-term boyfriend moved in, he began helping take care of her, too. It ended up becoming his full time job, too. So, by now, he hasn't worked a job on paper for years, I've never worked, and despite being willing to try I don't know if I could without breaking down.

When she died, both her back account and my grandma's was overdrawn. None, or next to none maybe? Of the bills were paid. Our electricity got shut off the day after she died. We.. managed to get it back on, but barely. Since then, most of the time has been spent job searching or applying, especially for my partner. However unfortunately we've yet to get a single call back. He's willing to do pretty much anything, except driving a truck on the road since he doesn't have a class A license for them, and the household can't really have him on the road constantly, either. But still, there's so few jobs here where we are that don't require many years experience, or degrees/specializations/licenses he doesn't have. We don't really know what to do to get work anymore. But our electricity is apparently set for shut off in two days, on the 19th, we've no way to pay it ourselves, they won't take any checks from my grandma's account (and I don't think I could legally write one even if they would)... What family we had refused to help before mum died, have not really talked to me since, and the ones that have have either not had any way to help, or any willingness - whether with bills or otherwise. Only one has been theoretically willing to talk, but not even about anything beyond surface sympathies, really. I at least have had the ability to talk with my partner and another friend, but none of my friends can really help, either, and none of them even live locally, and plans we had to move fell through about a year ago even. 

I've no idea what to do about any of this.. any solutions I can think of so far either fall through, don't work, or aren't actually options. There's some stuff I haven't gotten into in this, I know this is already too long as it is and some of it is stuff I'm more hesitant to just ""put out there"" but I can if it becomes relevant. I just hope someone out there is willing to read all this and can help, in whatever way. Everything just seems to be going wrong right now and I don't know how to make any of it better on my own anymore. And if you have read this far, thank you, thank you so much, whether you have anything to say or not &lt;3 You guys are awesome.

TL;DR: Was completely reliant on mother while also being her caretakers, leaving hubby and I taking care of her as full-time job, but she's suddenly died, and now our utilities are getting shut off. Despite spending all our time looking for and applying for jobs, no luck so far, and nowhere to turn to. Need help, of whatever sort, whether help with bills themselves, with getting jobs, with advice, whatever, anything would help. Thank you so much, you guys rock &lt;3

35,"tl:dr I was sexually abused and have been passive most of my life, but I ""created"" a character in my mind that is the complete opposite of myself, but also somewhat evil and find myself jumping into him uncontrollably.

I'm a 28 year old male and I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder with BPD like tendencies (although the various psychiatrist don't agree with one another). So when I was about 5 years old, I was sexually abused by my uncle and it went on and off for until I was about 11. Sometimes, I would initiate it because I didn't know any better and it felt good (which lead to a lot of shame from and prevented me from coming forward) but usually half way through I would sort of ""disconnect"" from my body and not feel anything. 


Anyway, he moved away to another state and I would only see him once or twice a year and he didn't do anything when I did see him.   Moving forward, I was really quite growing up and I would freak out if I had to leave the house or be in a large group of people. On top of that, I would usually get beat up pretty regularly at school, but didn't do anything because it a weird way, I felt like I deserved it, so I would be passive for most of my life.


In my mid-twenties, I created this sort of character in my head and thought he would be a cool protagonist and slowly turns into a antagonist in my writing (which is my creative outlet). But I noticed that this ""character"" was more or less me in the beginning which would be kind and empathetic and funny, but turn into the antithesis of that. 


I started to call him Steve which was the name of my abuser, but it was him per se in my head, if that makes sense. It was more or less me, but something was kind of off. Anyway, I found myself adopting this personality whenever I felt like I was being hurt which in turn would lead me to lash out at those that were trying to put me down. I would be very quick to turning to physical violence if I felt phsically threaten even if that wasn't the case, which has gotten me into trouble (thankfully not legally) and I've would be just an all around asshole. But the weird thing was that when I jumped into this person, I felt like I had little to no control over myself and even didn't really feel a lot of physical pain. 


There would be some positive aspects, though. For example, I'm normally very confident in a social setting, but when I would jump into this guy, I would be the life of the party and go from confident to full blown bravado confident. I even noticed that when I would jump into Steve, the way I walked would be slightly different and you wouldn't notice it unless you were paying attention. Also, when I would have sex, I would be A LOT more aggressive and dominating (which my girlfriend LOVED lol). But all in all there were more negatives than positives.

I'll wrap this up, I've gotten EMDR therapy for the abuse and it worked very well for me and still am in therapy usually once or twice a month, just to check up.

So I'm curious if anyone else has done this or am I just kind of weird?    ",17May2017,4

37,"And if you came here thinking I'm about to tell you that this is because I get no matches, you'd be wrong, cause I get enough matches.

The problem here is that I can't bring myself to delete the apps because of how addicting the immediate pleasure is of getting a match. If I consistently got zero matches, it'd be a whole hell of a lot easier to just delete it. But the fact that I have a considerable amount of matches makes me feel so subservient to the app as a huge source of emotional pleasure. 

Right now it's at the point where opening the app brings me a feeling of dread, because it feels like its teasing me. Like ""here's this person who likes you but they're hidden behind a barrier of digital communication and a glass screen."" I don't know. It makes me feel distant.

Not only this, but it makes me think to myself ""if I'm getting matches with people on this app, then how many people in my immediate vicinity think the same way about me? Could I be having these connections with people around me instead of on this app?"" Cue more frustration, cue Fear Of Missing Out.

I don't like how easy it is to ignore someone on these apps. I don't like that I can get involved in great conversation where there's mutual interest and then switch to completely ignoring them if someone perceivably ""better"" comes along. I don't like how easy these apps make it for me to do that, it doesn't feel nice to ignore people.

I don't know. I think, ultimately, the quantity is there, but I struggle to see quality. Not that the people I match with aren't ""quality"" but communicating with people on these apps feels so intangible and unreal, which is sad cause all these people on these apps are indeed tangible and real.

I don't like how easy it is to take comfort in the illusion of surplus, in the illusion of ""look how many people like you based on very little information!""

What makes me feel even shittier, is that I know getting matches on Tinder or Bumble is like sugar-high in that it hits quick and is over quick. I know that trying to foster meaningful relationships is better. But I just can't delete the damn app. It's not even about ""finding someone"" anymore, for me. It's a pleasure source built on a ""game-ification"" of dating.


But maybe that's just the world of dating, maybe I'm not experienced enough to know that the world of dating is filled with ignoring people and heartbreak and rejection and (often) objectification. Maybe the interactions on the apps aren't as misrepresentative of the real world as I thought. ",17May2017,20

41,"I was in the ER all night, I have collapsed at work. I had a bit of a rough night, and the doctor, looking at my history, recommended I talk to the psychiatrist in the morning. I stayed up all night until a nurse came around 5 in the morning. She told me she was taking me to access and she had to take everything. 


I had to take off my bra, shoes, socks, everything except my panties, including my jewelry. I couldn't even keep on my bracelet that my boyfriend custom made for me. They took my phone, too. They had me sit in a wheelchair and wheeled me toward the elevator. They pressed the button to the basement. They rolled me to a door with a window on it. I thought they admitted me straight to the unit because the man on the other side looked very, very disturbed. 


They told my dad he had to leave and that I could have no visitors. They put me in a room with just a bed. The tv by the er beds seemed like a luxury right now. The ""disturbed"" man ended up being one of the only two workers in the psych er, which they call ""access"". I was the only patient there, there was about 5 rooms and each had 2 beds. 


A man who only slept was put in the room next to me later that morning. I at first started pacing my room. I looked up the window, this basement seemed like it was 5 times deeper than mine at home. While trying to get in contact with my boyfriend with the nurses phone, I paced the hallway. 


On the wall were ""patients rights"". Bullshit, rights. All my times as a psych patient I was never treated with the same rights as a patient would in the ICU. I've been shit talked right in front of my face. I've been taken away my privileges because I didn't want to eat a beef patty. Trust me, I don't even think it was edible beef in there. Dog food.

We need to ""sign up"" to call. She pleaded and as she refused to go to bed, they restrained her to it.

46,"Ego felt sad about not meeting it's sparkzone to itself. Kept crying about it. Suck it up princess. Move on, it doesn't matter if your sparkzone rock the world didn't happen. Because you've been blinded by yourself to not see what more is there in that present moment , yet the ego plays the whining drama over being present. The suffering continues within in itself, it feels frustrated that it made a mistake that wasn't there, it feels like something should've happened when reality is absolute. It's ok to be so unaware little one, Once you awaken slightly once again you will see through and reflect. The problem is always within your perspective.
