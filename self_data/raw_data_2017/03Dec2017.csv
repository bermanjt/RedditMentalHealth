9,"I don't know what to say here, just feel zoned and on my own. I keep thinking about why I don't have anyone in my life and I don't have an answer anymore. I know I'm the common variable, but I can't just change things by knowing that as a whole, you know? I need to find the little variables and fix them, but I can't, keep trying and I can't find or fix anything. 

I feel like the people in my life are only in my life because they have to be, or because they feel bad for me. No one is there for me, for me as who I am. They're there because they don't have a choice, or because they want to pat themselves on the back and go ""look how much I matter, I help this loser feel like he has friends."" 

I don't know fuck. I can't fix or change anything at this point, just coasting forwards.

And I'm sitting here thinking ""should I"" like I already know the answer is no, but when I realize ""yes"" it's ""oh this is going well, oh this is going well, so I probably shouldn't"", but, so what? I got the internship, the job, I hooked up with someone and my masculinity is assured, yeah, yeah, but who is fucking there? Who will be there when I'm in DC? Who will be there Monday when I want to get lunch and I end up eating alone? So what, accomplishments are one thing but real, human connections are another thing entirely and I'm bad at those. 

What happens the next day, when I see her on campus and she avoids looking at me and I feel like a creep even though I asked and she said ""yes?"" How will I feel?

What happens when I get off work and I go home and I sit there in a dark room alone on reddit for eight hours until I go to bed and lather, rinse, repeat?

What happens when I'm in DC and I have to network? How will I build that if I can't connect?

What happens when I meet someone, and I get married, and I'm looking for a best man or friends to invite to my wedding? Who'll be there? 

How can I make a relationship work?

I have all the party addresses, I can get that, but no one to go with. The other weekend I decided that I wouldn't text anyone for the whole weekend, and further, until someone texted me. No one texted me. I waited three days, no one reached out, not my mom even, no one. 

I'm whining, yeah, I know that. But it fucks with me. I try my best to connect with people and nothing comes of it and it fucks with me, I'm on my own.

10,"Firstly, if your dog is ill-mannered and potentially dangerous, why would you bring it to a public park?!

Secondly, the dog park I go to has 4 separate areas. My dog is medium sized but can go into the small dog park because he's under 30 pounds still. All the parks are empty except one, the small dog park. I see a bunch of teeny dogs in there. So we go. 

As we are approaching the gate, the small dogs are doing the usual small dog tough guy act. I'm like ok, and I ask the owners directly, ""is it safe to come in?"" The man is like ""yeah, it's fine""

NOT FINE DEFINITELY NOT FINE

I find out that all 4 of the dogs belong to this one single couple. All 4 of the small death traps are immediately lunging after my boy, who is a coward anyway, and I was not immediately upset but then I saw they were biting my dog. And then when the owners couldn't control their dogs (at this point, the dogs were lunging at ME), I was rightfully pissed, especially because they kept telling me it was fine.

And so I was cursing, i was basically like ""Jesus h Christ it's clearly not fine, I guess I'LL leave!"" Et cetera. 

And then the woman said, ""Well you shouldn't even be in here, this is the small dog park!"" 

So I guess I won't go into details because I'm not trying to be r/iamverybadass but some fuck offs were exchanged, I asked them why the fuck would they bring dogs like this to a public dog park, and so on and so forth.

But I was really shaken up by it and so was my dog! What in the literal fuck?! My dog has a few scratches but he's okay. I'm pissed though. ",03Dec2017,21

I enjoy walking, sometimes i walk around downtown of my city, just to see what’s around, I’ve ended up in some fun situations just because i was walking around at the right place 

And when I’m not doing either, I’m just kinda bullshitting (mindlessly on reddit, fb or watching porn) or watching videos or reading to learn something

15,"I just went to a party for a not so close friend of mine. Only with people she knew were there and everyone I knew couldnt, wouldnt, or hadnt come yet so I stayed in the background. I didnt drink because I was driving and only planned to stay for a little while so I was pretty awkwardly standing around. I talked to one guy for a bit and he was cool. Some of the people there kind of acknowledged me but didnt conversate with me and I didnt really have the chance to start talking to them.

A few months ago I asked my friend about one of her friends I saw on a post of hers and she said she would ask to see if she was interested. I brought it up again a week later but she hadnt asked her yet so I never mentioned it again so I wouldnt come off weird or pushy. I eventually saw a girl I used to date with the guy she told me not to worry about back then and it made me realize how worthless I am.

I reached the point of understanding that I am just not worth dating considering how she lead me on, manipulated me, accused me of cheating, the guy also lied to me about her, other girls I have dated have done similar things to me, and every other girl I didnt date have just rejected me. So cut back to today and my friends friend was at the party.

I introduced myself to a bunch of people when I walked in, including her. I stuck with the guy, she would usually come over and talk to him and seems like they are good friends. I think she may have looked at me a few times but she was usually dancing or talking to someone next to me.

Eventually some guy came over to her and she stayed talking to him. I tried making conversation with another girl that recently showed up but she would just answer questions and she didnt seem like she wanted to talk to me. I left the party only saying bye to my friend and I pretty much cried on the drive home. All my thoughts of my failed ""relationships"", being treated like crap by the girls Ive dated, how I didnt belong at the party and looked like a lost dog the entire time, how Im so horrible socially at parties, clubs, bars etc when people my age live for these things, just everything bad about me came rushing in. 

I am usually like that after social events because I dont belong there even though Im at the age where this is the norm and meeting someone is only possible at these things. Probably thats one of the reasons I have had issues with dating. I just wish I could move away from everything and everyone I know so I could live the way Im intended to live, alone. I cant deal with seeing the girl I used to date with the guy around campus, running into other girls I used to date in public, my parents nagging and complete misunderstanding of my own issues, this small bedroom that I have to share with my brother, friends who I cant even talk to about this stuff anymore, just everything.

If I have to deal with problems everywhere in my life why cant I just do it alone instead of having a fake support system? My family blames me for any problem that comes my way, and my friends just give me cliche advice or maybe cant help if they even want to so it becomes nothing to them. I give people so much and I have never received that back. I dont expect people to give me anything but a better level of respect would be nice. My problems feel so stupid to actual things people have to deal with and people just tell me things will be ok. 

I dont think they ever will, Im turning 23 in a few days and I have nothing to show for it. I think once I graduate I will just be working until retirement until I leave. I dont care about my degree or the job I have lined up, the only thing that could have made my life worth something was knowing that some girl cared about me and I have been shown many times that I will never get that because Im not good enough for that. I dont see anything else happening in my life that will ever make me happy or make me feel alive. 

There will only be downs from here and Im always going to face them alone. At least I have a brother and sister who can continue the family, I just hope I can make it to retiring with enough money to sustain myself.",03Dec2017,1

17," Not sure if I'm on the right thread but here it goes anyway. I spent a lot of time working on two projects that can potentially lead to a paper publishing in a research journal. But I did it at the cost of giving up all my time to study. The issue is my performance decides my tuition fee. With such a phenomenal drop in my grades I've been going through a terrible surge of guilty conscience for not studying and hence making my parents pay more.....all the more there is still so much to be done for the project to be completed. leaving me wondering if I did the right thing by sacrificing my grades for it. I've never fared this bad in my academics in my life and am struggling to cope up with this harsh reality.

21,"My ex was practically my support group. I didn’t realize at the time, but my girlfriend hid so many insecurities I had with compliments and love, and hid my sadness with happiness and laughs when we would talk for hours. 
I really didn’t need anyone else but her because she was amazing, and it wasn’t like we would break up out of the blue because of how invested we were in each other.

Next thing you know, we’re broken up, and I really don’t have anyone but myself. It isn’t that I don’t have friends, I do, just none that knew me well and that I talked to outside of school a lot. I’m Anti-Social not because I have social anxiety, but because she was all I needed and I didn’t feel like spending time building relationships with other people.

Thanksgiving break was horrible, as I had no one to talk with to help me through sad times, meanwhile, I know she had friends right by her side assuring her how great she was and how she would be okay.

I never realized just how depressed I am and how lonely I am without her. And how insecure I am about myself about the way I am and the way I look. Now, I mainly talk to myself. I act as if someone’s listening and we’re having a conversation, and I’m venting out to them, but it’s a sad reality when you realize how alone you are. 

I could text and call other people for help, but none of them are close to me and truly know me well. 

I’m sad, not sucidal thankfully, but very depressed about what I am and how I am.

I look at all the girls from his country, from his neighboring countries, his coworkers, his classmates, his neighbors, and it makes me shrink even smaller. Coming from a poor country, I fall behind to everything. Ballet lessons? Never had them. Violin and piano classes, they're too much. Horseback riding? It's for the rich and upper class. And everyone, every single female he knows seems to be adept in at least one. And me? What do I have? Absolutely nothing next to them. 

A while back we had a argument that I never care for myself. It's true. I never cared about my physical appearance. Why should I? I have more things to worry about than having good eyebrows, good skin, toned tummy. I never cared. Coming from middle class, which is leaning closer to the poor sector, I cared more about babysitting my siblings, getting a part time job, chores, laundry, bills, debts, food for dinner, making sure my sister doesn't starve. Our lives are better now, I guess. And I'm free to do as I please. But I wish I cared. Then maybe I'd have a bit more class, less acne scars, more talents, better body shape.

I was born in September 1991 in Australia still live here .  I was not born with cerebral palsy . I had a car crash when I was just a month old  it was nobody fault hell im still not sure exactly what happened but from my understanding my mum over corrected and it rolled and I got thrown from  my baby seat through the window . My brain popped out of my skull pretty much so I have a metal plate in my head and that's how I got cerebral palsy . Growing up was pretty good  I lived next to a kid  who would end be my best friend and just a few weeks ago I was the best man at  his wedding and nailed my speech . 

Growing up  was pretty school was good had friends only had two guys that bullied me on a regular basis . In a funny story was the first day of my final year and I was in the same class as one of the guys and I reckon we had barley be in the class for more then 10 minutes before he gave me crap and I don't know what came over me but I turned around and just flew out my chair and started to lay into hahahaha needless say not many people liked the guy and even the teacher did not get up me haha . 

While I was at school I did work experience and ended up getting a traineeship so I finished that while I finished school .  Although once I finished school I have since stopped working but would like to again just still unsure what I want do but I think most people like that . 

A few years after school I lived with a couple mates was a real party house but once we left I swore I'd never rent and I bought a place with the money I got from the crash .  But st the same time as I was living with my mates my mum and dad had split never really got along with him . But he tried take me court and get my money for his . That day in court was the last time I saw him and hope it's the last . 

So I bought a place and since then I've been traveling the world been to the USA , Europe , Jamaica and Mexico and Haiti . I'm going back to the USA again next year . 

I've learnt how play Xbox one hand I can cook clean go gym etc only thing I can't do is drive but I never really let that get to me 

so yer that's a little about me if have any questions I'll answer to the best I can . Thanks for letting me share    ",03Dec2017,271
28,"I write this as I sit here, sat in a video chat as she drifted off to sleep.

She does have trouble sleeping but somehow me being there while calm relaxing music plays keeps her calm.


She's smart (even though she says she isn't), she's kind and caring (even if she gets moody and sarcastic when under stress), she's witty and funny, her smile lights me up inside. She did struggle with DID, possibly because no one seemed to empathise with her or even take steps to help her in this (which I have done - I went to great lengths to read up on DID, how to manage it, how to be by her side when things are tough, to even curb my own temper issues), but she knows that no matter what I'm here and from that she's had very few flare-ups or episodes, if at all. She's beautiful in her way and she makes me feel so incredibly lucky to even know her.


For nearly 3 years after my wife left for another man I felt I'd never find this feeling again. No, that's not accurate - this is better than what I once had. This is very different, and for once I like different. And it's right here, thousands of miles away in the US while I'm sat here at 8:46am in the UK.


I'm excited to fly to her in July. To spend even just a week with her, which is enough to potentially make me decide whether I leave England behind for her. I've never felt or thought that way before about leaving the country that molded me and shaped me; a place that has ""everything on my doorstep"", I call home with my family and friends here. It's going to be a hard decision to leave them behind - my Mom, my Dad, my sister, my band, my workmates, my friends and extended family....it's going to be very hard.


I don't know if this is just the butterflies I feel in my stomach whenever I see her hazel and green eyes, her button nose, her long brown wavy wild hair, that cute small smile she has or if this is something true and strong...but I do know that she makes me the happiest I've been in a long time and I am so very grateful for that.

It's not even a ""need"" that I feel. I just enjoy her. I enjoy her so much, I miss her when she sleeps and when she works, even for just 5 minutes. And not a day goes by where she isn't in my head, enough to make me want to bellow from rooftops how much I love her. I get even the dumbest grin on my face whenever she does something small. It makes me burst with happiness to see she's having a good day, that she's done something she is proud of and in turn I'm always so proud of her because she has come a long way too.

I thank her for even just the slightest thing, for being that one woman who truly broke down any walls I had that I'd put up to never be hurt again, for being just so awesome.

Even my friends and family have noticed I've been much happier since meeting her. Like I finally have that shine in my eyes again. That I have my soul back. Even my mom passed comment on how pretty she is. And she really is and then some.

I hope that one day we are together, doing what we do as individuals and being an amazing couple. While today is not that day, I hold out hope, because it must mean something if I'm so willing to give up everything I have here to be with her, right?

If I do this I'll miss everyone. But I'll be with her. And there's so much world out there to see with her.

I serve in the IDF, and today, due to how close we are to release, we were sent to a convention about job applications, courses, etc.

Partially of a fully paid course to train you in that skill (IT, Management, app creation, electrician, hotel jobs including management, medical research, etc)

Instant employment

Funds to live through during the course, in case you won't work during the course, etc.

32,"So let me just give a little bit of context to this story.
I was going out with this girl for a while at this point, and we had been getting intimate on a few separate occasions. We tried doing it a couple times, but she definitely wasnt mentally ready and was incredibly tense, so understandably it wasnt going to work. However, this fateful day, she said she was definitely ready, and wanted to go through with it, so we started getting into it for a while, and once we got to that point, i tried to put it in VERY slowly, and it was fine, and then suddenly she screamed out in pain. I immediately stopped and backed off and she ran to the bathroom. At this point I was like ""what the fuck"", and was hoping that I really didnt hurt her too bad. I asked if she was okay and she said she was fine, so i waited in my room for a while.

15 or so minutes go by, and I was getting worried, so i went to the bathroom door and asked if she was okay again.. No response. 

Asked again.. No response..

So at that point i opened the door and walked in, and she was sprawled out across the floor, unresponsive. I was understandably freaking out, shaking her, trying to wake her, but she wasnt responding. She was still breathing, so I picked her up and layed her down in my bed and waited for her to wake up.
Eventually she woke up. I asked her if she was okay, and she gave me the blankest stare, and didnt really say anything. I thought she was still groggy or something, so i gave her a minute. She then proceeded to say, ""What am I doing here, who are you?"". At this point i was bamboozled, and said ""Hey its me, we were just hanging out here beforehand"". 

She then replied with ""Were we studying chemistry here?"" That scared the fuck out of me, as our chemistry class ended about 5 months prior to that. Turns out after asking her questions, she didnt know that we were in a relationship, she didnt remember about the last 6 months of her life. We had been dating for about 4 months at that time, so she had forgotten the entire relationship, and we weren't super close friends beforehand, so she basically didnt really know me at all. I felt absolutely horrible for her, cause she woke up in my bed completely naked, and didn't really know who I was, so she was probably freaked out of her mind.

It took her about a month or so to start remembering bits and pieces of our relationship, but definitely not enough for her to jump right back into it, so understandably, the relationship kinda fizzled out at that point. We did end up getting back together for a while, but that ended due to her moving away. We were never able to figure out what happened. We went to the hospital and the doctor, but no conclusive results were made. I possibly thought it could be some sort of seizure where you kinda zone out for a while, based on previous experiences that had occurred.

So yeah... Basically she collapsed, and forgot who I was.
Real Shit


Just want to add an edit here to add some more information..

One day i was driving her home one day, and we were both singing along to a song, and that was going on for a bit. I looked over at her and she had stopped singing, and was just staring at me with an extremely blank stare, it was like she wasn't there. She didnt say anything, and was extremely unresponsive, but still staring. I was talking to her, asking what was wrong, but no response from here. I got to the house, and tried talking to her, but again no response. Then she kinda just got out of the car, looking kinda frightened, and walked in to her house. At this point i had to go to work, so I called a friend, and asked if she could take her to the hospital or something, cause at this point i was thinking it could possibly be a absense seizure or something along those lines (however the episode she had lasted for a couple minutes, and from what ive seen on absense seizures, they are pretty brief). The friend cane down immediately, and was able to talk to her, and convince her to go to the hospital, where they ended up doing an EEG, but mothing was found...
(Also this happened after the main post, in the time where we started dating again)

Another edit as i am getting criticism for not calling an ambulance.

She had episodes in the past where she had collapsed at our school, presumably out of stress. I assumed that this was just another episode, and that she just needed a few minutes to come back to her senses. She was still breathing fine, and it didnt take too long for her to wake back up. She also wasnt fully unconscious, like her body wasnt limp.
Also we did go to a walk in clinic once she was awake, and i explained to them the entire situation, and they just reccomended rest.",03Dec2017,134

I went to a horrible Cristian institution since I was six years old, where nuns instilled in me in a very early age that my life was worthless and that my only purpose was to help the needy and serve the church. I was beaten on a daily basis. I ran away to live with a distant relative of mine two years ago after I got my hands on a phone. Even though my life is still better today, I feel brainwashed. I constantly have nightmares and panic attacks. So yeah, my life is pretty shit. I'm 16 and have no idea what I like, what I'm good at, or really much that the church hasn't literally knocked into my head.
I have the kind of ""selflessness"" the church loves, which is literally not caring about myself. Because ""valuing oneself over others (or at all) is evil and satanic.""

I want to care more about myself and my life, but I just don't know how.

What I do know is that I have a Reddit addiction, and need some advice ASAP.",03Dec2017,7
36,"So I’m best friends with this girl and have a massive thing for her. I talk to her more than anyone, she’s honestly like a massive ray of sunshine in my life. Brings around her just makes me so happy, it’s just amazing. We are insanely close, but she has a boyfriend. So naturally while I have massive feelings for her, I have to just bite my tongue and keep being her friend. Kinda sucks sometimes, but it’s worth it to have her in my life. She means the world to me, she’s probably my best friend.

Anyway, while she is amazing, I obviously have to try get on with my life while she’s in a relationship. I can’t keep pining after a girl who has a boyfriend forever. If it’s meant to happen it will, being her friend is good enough for now. I always tell myself if something else comes along then I’d just let it happen, cause in all honesty if nothing else I could use the experience. So last night I was out with my friends and while girls never usually take that much notice of me, I had three separate girls approach me who were being pretty damn flirty, and I could tell would have been open to something happening. One girl in particular was absolutely throwing herself at me to the point where my friends were thinking I was being really weird for not doing anything.

But every time it happened I just thought about this other girl. It’s like no other girls even seem attractive when she’s in my life. I realise how irrational and stupid it sounds, I felt like a fucking idiot. I should have been happy to just have anyone show interest. But I just couldn’t face going out and doing anything with another girl. It’s like there’s just a mental block. I’ve never had this happen before. I feel stupid for being so into someone I can’t be with to the point that I can’t even think about being with anyone else. Like how the hell am I meant to move on properly when I can’t even face a drunken make out or whatever with someone else? I honestly feel like an idiot. 

**TL;DR:** I have a massive thing for my best friend. She has a boyfriend though, so I’m trying to just move on with my life a little for now. But even when I get the chance, I just can’t face getting with another girl. It’s like other girls aren’t even attractive anymore, and all I can think about is her. How am I meant to get over this?",03Dec2017,2
37,"I meet a girl in train, I am poor so it was my first time in reserved class i was going to my sisters home because she was sick.     

In train a cute girl was sitting next to me, this was my first time i approached a girl
She  was sitting next to me,  i was sitting beside window seat she broke the ice by asking,""kahan jaoge"" then we chatted at first I was nervous then i chatted calmly, after that she asked my Instagram username and wrote it in her book which she was reading. then her mom interchanged her seat. So now i was sitting next to her mom, well i forgot to tell that girl is muslim...     

Next day i got follow request from that girl on Instagram.        


I have complimented her that she is cute
Because there is nothing wrong in showing your feelings, whether someone feels the same or not. It's your feeling and you should express it          
 
She is too cute, her voice is cute and everything about her is cute 😍.

40,"English is not my native language. ""lonely"" ist not quite right, neither ""forsaken"", ""solitary"" ... but something like that. But let's stay with desolate.

I'm feeling desolate, even if I'm not alone. 

I'm 48, grew up as introvert/nerd (Commodore64!) married in 2000, got kids, separated in 2013. Fell in love with a woman, didn't work out (early 2014). Interestingly few months between 2013 and 2014 were harder on me than separating from my ex wife. Kids are with me most weekends and 2-3 days every week. My ex wife and me can talk respectfully, sometimes help each other out with the occasional eye-rolling about each other. I wouldn't want her back and she me neither.

Up into my mid 30's I had mostly men as friends, talking nerd stuff and computers. Around 2000 I started ballroom dancing (met my kids' mother there) stopped (when kids were small) and restarted with Salsa and Zouk after we separated. So interestingly nowadays most of my friends are women.

And yes, friends. Know them from dancing and/or other social activties, got my Whatsapp and Telegram list full of contacts. It takes a ""what are you doing at Tuesday"" for example to ask somebody out. Or even vice versa, yesterday one of my friends asked me to go to a Christmas Market around here.

One more thing: I'm not interested in a partner. There's one woman and we're friends with benefits. I'm not interested in someone being around for daily routine. (German word is ""Alltag"". Can't find a good translation for that). Friends with benefits is for over two and a half years now, so it's not ""I don't want to commit"", but rather ""when we meet let it be a good time, not chores"".

So kids are here (today as well for example, have been making crepes for them this morning), I do go out, see people, do have real friends. Go dacing, have sport training etc. Oh yes, and a job with nice colleagues, too. I believe if I'd search for a woman, I'd find the right one.

Still I am feeling desolate. 

I feel this gravitates about ""love"", even as I can't imagine somebody in my life right now I remember the time when I met someone end of 2013. (And while I do not miss her right now, I really do miss the feeling how you feel when you fall in love with someone.)

Maybe I can't fall in love at this moment in time.

A friend of mine told me ""just wait, you'll meet the right person"". No. I've met a bunch of great woman, easy to do when you go dancing. What I do enjoy is dancing, what does not happen is me falling in love.

So somehow I'm at a loss understanding (emotionally) myself and I'd be happy about food for thought. Maybe some of you experienced something similar?

46,"For the last few years, I get woken up by a heavy knock on the front door or hear a loud doorbell chime.  I will get up, race to put on suitable clothing, rush to the door and open it. But it’s 5am and nobody is outside.

I’ll ask around the house: ”someone ring the door bell?”

and the responses will be

“When?” “What door bell?” “No”.

Then I know it’s happened again. I’ve imagined it in my sleep.

Unfortunately, most articles on the internet are by people who believe it’s spirits/ghosts/“contact” - I do not believe in any of those nor do I believe in anything supernatural.

49,"My wife makes me so angry sometimes. She thinks she is so righteous and so high above me. 

Our 3yo daughter watches a lot of television. Way too much by any measure. She throws a screaming crying fit when we tell her it’s time to turn off the computer (that’s where she watches Netflix.) Cartoons have become all she cares about, and when we are away from the house she is always saying, “I’m going to watch the internet when we get home.” And if I say, “No more internet today, baby,” then she will ask why and have a breakdown right there in the store. 


So today my wife was getting ready to take our daughter out to get food and we had to go through the miserable process of getting her away from the computer.  My wife was doing most of the work this time and I was observing the catastrophe. I could see clearly how unhealthy the computer has become for our daughter. So I made a comment about removing television from her life for a week. 

For some reason my wife was demanding to know why. I was like, “Wow do you really have to ask why?!” Yes, she would not leave me alone until I answered her fucking question. It turns out that she simply had a stick up her ass and was trying to judge the reasons behind my parenting decisions. But I essentially told her it’s because our daughter needs to detox from the cartoons. 

My wife suddenly started giving me ultimatums like I can’t turn on the PlayStation for a week. She was straight up defending our daughters television usage right in front of her because apparently I’m a child too.

So I asked her why the hell she would even contest me on this and she said, “Because I don’t think you are doing it for the right reasons.” Because my wife is so fucking righteous. I’m playing PlayStation about two or three hours broken up throughout the day. I understand that’s quite a bit but it’s only because the new Call of Duty just came out and I like it. Before this, my PlayStation hadn’t been turned on for four months. I binge video games like that and I enjoy myself. My wife hates to see a controller in my hands. She thinks it makes me immature, selfish, and careless about the real world. But that is somewhat the fucking point of games. And it’s not different than her reading and entire romance novel everyday.

Anyway my daughter is a tv junkie, my wife is a righteous bitch and I’m venting.



EDIT: Since the argument this morning my wife is now intentionally sitting out daughter down at the computer when I turn the PlayStation on. ",03Dec2017,3

58,"Well... I know, reading the title you might say that having no job is worse because friendship/love can't pay your bills but for me it isn't that easy.

I live in germany and I'm doing my apprenticeship at the moment. It's an occupation that doesn't offer much jobs... or they're often for a limited period. I already moved for this apprenticeship out of my parents' house to a new town where I knew absolutely no one. Since then so over the last 2 years I have found some friends which I'm really really grateful for. The problem is: I don't wanna leave them behind. There's especially one person who is really important to me. Leaving this person would just leave me in tears, I guess. Next year I'm gonna finish my apprenticeship and if I'm lucky, they will keep me for half a year or a year. But I'm not really happy there, the company is really awful, especially the colleagues. So I wouldn't mind not working there anymore, maybe it's better that way. But I wanna stay here, in this town or at least close by... Because of my friends.

Moving to the end of this country for a job could also be a possibility if I can't find anything in the vicinity. :l I could also study that would mean I could stay here for another 3-4 years... but I don't really know to finance that and if it's the right thing for me. If I'm the right kind of person for a study. ... 

Another thing that could happen and that I'm really afraid of is me being unemployed after I've finished my apprenticeship. So then I'd be staying here but I would have no job. ... 

I'm a really shy person so it's really hard for me to find new friends, I tend to stay inside... If I imagine I'm moving to another town hundred kilometres away where I (again) know absolutely nobody, I see myself being lonely all the time. … 

So, what do you think? This decision is really hard for me it could change my entire life... :l

I'm sorry if not everything makes sense, I'm really tired, its kinda late here in this country...

The same thing has just happened. So essentially I have wasted my Saturday and my Sunday sleeping all day to prepare for these long night shifts and now I have made no money this weekend.
