3,"Shes gone, on the plane right now, and I'm so incredibly happy for her and her opportunity, but I feel empty. I know its best for both of us to not try long distance, but I hate this feeling I have. She deserves a fresh start in a new country, and I know from past experiences how much long distance takes a toll on me. I know I would get jealous, or clingy, or distant, or something and I would hate to lose her forever because of it. I wish I wasnt shaped by my past relationships - even though shes a completely different soul whom I trust 100%, Im just too afraid of it not working out. When I think of her, I think of years from now, us doing dumb stuff like hanging out on a Saturday drinking too much coffee or going to the orchestra, or renting a lake house, but the reality is that were both working on graduate degrees, are from across the country from one another, and have lifestyles and careers that will take us around the country and the world. Theres so many legitimate reasons for us to break up now and Im not going to pretend like this is some cheesy rom-com where we can just ""go for it"" because ""only we can make it work."" I could and I know she would. But this is real life and I feel that us staying together now will hurt the life-long relationship I could have with her, but if we could just fast forward out of this ""life transition"" time of our post-college lives, we'd start a life together. I feel like half the people my age have either fully gone on the family or career track, and now Im stuck in between thinking that either direction will leave my other half empty. All that said, even if we could make it work, we already decided to break up a few weeks ago, and doubled down three days ago. I hate the part of myself that knows in my heart and mind its a good decision. I wish once I could be reckless but Im too nervous to lose her forever. So now Im just sitting here thinking about it.

4,"I've had chronic depression and anxiety for, well, as long as I can remember. I can't remember what full emotions feel like, how to be empathic.  It's just not in my system, and I can fully say I don't know what it is like to live without constant anxiety and dulled emotions. I am currently on the path to recovery, my doctor is wanting to put me on medication but I'd like therapy first. As for now, this is my letter, My Ode to my Best Friend, a goodbye. 

Because I don't know a world without them, and that scares me more than you can believe, to think that I've been living a half life. It's like the thought of suddenly being able to see real colours after a life of being colourblind. I just needed to get it out somewhere, because I don't want to go through this alone. I'm losing a part of me, and gaining another one, but right now, that part is a stranger. 
***
****
As of late  
Everyone talks about you  
Because you know everyone  
You've learned the motions  
You've sang their song  
And you've been with me  
For so long I've lost track  
You have been there for everything  
My imaginary friend  
But you were real  
And now  
So many people turning on you  
All I can do is ask  
Why me  
They say you're empty  
Full of loneliness and despair  
But you've been with me for so long  
How can I say  
I know everything about you  
And nothing at all  
You are my best friend  
My darkness  
Without you  
Who am I  
I don't know what the world looks like  
Without your hands covering my eyes  
So don't leave me   
My blackened butterfly  
My sweetest lullaby  
I've never known a time alone  
Please  
My friend  
Don't leave me  
Don't go  
I know I have to  
But  
I'm not ready to say goodbye

5,"I've noticed that, like most humans, my mood tends to vary from day-to-day, not just within a single day. I've gone through periods of overall negative mood (sadness, anger, anxiety) and periods of positive mood (happiness, excitement, confidence). The variations in my overall mood tends to last ""a few days"" -- like 2-5. Of course, sometimes longer.

I've noticed that when I'm coming out of a slum, once the anxiety has faded, soon run-of-the-mill stressful events become easier to deal with, and then, finally, after a period of sustained good mood...

I start narrating. I start singing! I mean only when no one is listening. For example, I watch recorded lectures for school -- when I'm happy, I start ""talking back"" -- joking around, critiquing, even playfully yelling, you know as if messing around in lecture. Doesn't happen when I'm feeling ""meh"".

A song gets stuck in my head; oh it's not staying in there. If I'm feeling great you can bet the rest of the world will be acutely aware of just what songs are in my head. 

There's also a good bit of physical skipping/jumping that takes place in these moments of excitement. Little hand-flapping too. 

Just wanted to share this with you, /r/self. ",29Aug2017,1
6,"Ok so my roommate is an alcoholic. Once she starts drinking at parties she doesn't stop until she get blackout drunk. She is getting a little too comfortable with the guys on the third floor. My original plans for the weekend were ruined. Instead of meeting my boyfriend at the university, I met him at the hospital. My grandmother is in the hospital, I didn't find out until he was 45 minutes away. I wasn't able to visit her until 6. 

After visiting her my boyfriend and I went to my dorm to do stuff. I thought my roommate would be out partying. Her friend walked in on us trying to do it, then dragged her other friend and my roommate to look at us. For the past 30 minutes they ran ding dong ditched and opened the door at random times. They even went out of their way to write ""Fucking LHH"". Like they couldn't come up with something better. When they decided to leave for good, things went good for my boyfriend and I. 

The next day my dad came to give me some water and cookies, nothing wrong with that. Later he told me to go visit my grandmother, so I did. While visiting her, my roommate sends me a screenshot of my sister, on Messenger. She said ""kill yourself anorexic whore"". She asked why My Sister is messaging her. I just told her to block her. I confronted my sister immediately. She claims she did the right thing because she didn't want me to get raped by one of her friends. She even said she did it because she is an ""alcoholic thot"". The conversation continued with ""I hate your friends, your roommate is a slut, I didn't do anything."" I had no choice but to cut my own sister out of my life. I will not tolerate anyone who is going out of their way to harass anyone regardless. She called me five times straight so I had no choice but to block her number. Then my dad told me it was my fault for telling my sister what my roommate is like. He blamed me for everything my sister did. He went on and on about how autistic she is and how she can't control herself. 

Fuck, autistic or not, she doesn't have the right to harass people she doesn't know. My other family members at the hospital were taking my sister's side because she is autistic. Heck, even my twelve year old cousin was dragged into it. Like a twelve year old who just started sixth grade wants to listen to this bull shit. My grandmother even went as far as to suggest Dr. Phill to help her. I understand he is good at what he does, but my sister would just make an even bigger fool of herself than the catch me outside girl. Well my mom went home upset, I stayed for another two hours, went home to take a shower. I went back to my dorm and stayed for the whole weekend. I slept all day Sunday and stayed up all night studying. 

The next morning I sat with my friends to eat breakfast. As I was about to leave my roommate's best friend invited me to sit with her. I sat with her thinking she wanted to say hi. The following events that happened this weekend were brought up. I told them about my grandmother's situation and I told them I had disowned my sister. She knew what my sister did. She accused me of telling my sister my roommate is this horrible person. She said if my sister contacts her, she is going to tell the RA I brought a boy in my room. Now I am being punished because of a situation I cannot control. 

Later I found out my roommate filled a police report against my sister. My dad had to call up the school begging them not to press charges because of her ""disability"". After my last class I played on the computer for two hours. When she came back I decided to take a shower. When I was finished, I came back in my room to find all of her stuff gone. I sent a picture of the empty bed to my dad to show what my sister caused. Her friends came in my room to remove her pictures and empty the fridge. I asked her what was going on. All she said was ""Check your email, Andrea will tell you everything."" I checked my email and went down to her office immediately. I told her my situation, and from her I found out my sister had sent multiple messages to push her off the edge. When I went back into my room I called my dad. This was the third time he wanted my roommate's number today. He wanted to take care of the situation himself and if I didn't, he would contact the dean. I just said I would talk to her just so he can shut up. 

Five minutes later I ended up talking to them. Her best friend was in the room along with five other people. She said the same thing she did at breakfast but she blamed me for all this without giving me a chance to defend myself. My roommate stayed out late because she was afraid of me. She cried all weekend because of me. Now she is in a new room and there is nothing I can do. All I could do was ball my eyes out as I listened to her go on and on making me look like an evil person. I walked out of the room and she said ""Bye, see you at band class,"" like nothing happened. I ran back to my room as quickly as I could and tried to throw up. All I could do was cry like a baby as I lay there helpless. 

My friend Courtney (who was  in the room) texted me to see if I was ok. The RA in the other building, Megan, came in to see if I was ok. I finally said for the first time in years, ""No, I  not ok."" Courtney told me it was just the first week of college and things will pass. I said to Courtney ""Truth is I am jealous. She can make friends so easily, she is so outgoing and nice. I can't be like that."" (Which is not true, since she thinks I am the bad person, I am just telling her what she wants to hear.) Meanwhile, my roommate's friend Megan came in my room to see if I was ok. I wasn't. She basically said the same things Courtney said but she gave me the satisfaction of showing me the original message. My sister went as far as telling my roommate to drink bleach and die. She even went on to tell her bully story again to the hundredth time and saying I'm the favorite of the family. 

I told her it's the same shit everyday. I get told to kill my myself at least three times a day which hired my tolerance level. I decided I couldn't handle myself enough to show up at band practice. I want to be a happy confident person and I don't want to look like a crying mess in front of everyone. I became so angry I left and went to my dad's business. Beating the crap out of my sister was the main reason for showing up. When I got there, she wasn't there so I had to tell my coworker all of my problems like the girl who rants about her entire life on Facebook. When I was about to get to the nasty part, my boyfriend's dad walked in the room, so I didn't finish my story. 

My dad showed me the messages my sister sent him. Turns out my sister got revenge for being the twin who didn't fit in. She threatened my roommate just to make my life hell. She felt no remorse and is proud of what she had done. After an hour I came back to college to finish my homework. Megan and my RA came in my room to check up on me. She claims everyone in band knows including my band director. Megan yelled at  my roommate's best friend for scaring me off. 

The good news is, I am getting a better roommate. I blocked my sister form social media. I just hope it's over. 

I don't care if she is Autistic or not, she is a horrible person. She will never have empathy for others and she will never have a single friend in the world. She doesn't deserve me or anyone else. She Is Dead To Me.",29Aug2017,0
7,"It was gently shut down due to the selfish behavior of an inconsiderate bully. 

This place helped people with a dangerous hobby find like-minded individuals who could help them safely continue to partake in what they enjoyed.

So I went ahead and made a new basket for the apples to come together. Hopefully it will be a while before the bad apples spoil it again.

8,"I really wish something would come into my life to keep me here. Everytime something shows up that gives me a smidget of hope, it leaves. Hopes go up then plummet and will never climb fully back up again. The only thing keeping me around is a blue, inanimate object. It can't talk back and can't keep me around forever. I envision the darkness and it's embrace is the only comfort I have. All I need is somebody to listen. Somebody who would care enough to sit and listen to it all. But I'm broken. I can't find anybody, I can't sit with them, I can't talk, I can't express my feelings. I can't see myself anymore. I can only sit with my thoughts and talk to myself. My thoughts are broken and simply break me more. A lifetime of mental isolation tears one apart. A lifetime of emotional isolation destroys the blueprints. I'm out of will. I'm out of strength. I'm going to fall off the chair one of these times. I'm going to veer off the road. I'm just wishing something would come and stop me. I know nothing will, but maybe that's my last spark of hope talking. Im going to close my eyes and let the warmth take me. It's the only comfort I have left.",29Aug2017,6
10,"Sometimes I think about my last relationship, which caused me extremely severe stress. I remember skyping with my ex (then girlfriend) and her saying ""I don't think I'll ever date again.""

i don't think I'd anticipate at that moment that she'd cheat on me with a friend that I trusted. I didn't expect the shit that'd come after I dumped her. I heard she's engaged or married to him now, but I can't really care less maybe they're good for each other. I certainly didn't think I'd never have enough trust or confidence to ever want to start dating again.

11,"I am a guy. My best friend is a girl. We are both 18. Last year of high school...


Before you think of me as some creepo or weirdo.... I'll explain myself a bit. I am a really shy guy. Introvert, quiet, and I have anxiety. I don't find it easy to talk to people. I prefer being alone, but I am a totally fun person around a select few. They are my best friends, and cousins. 

Now, she and I have been best friends since February this year. I started having feelings for her around May-ish. But they were clean feelings, I would say. I had never felt like that... Towards anyone. I fell in love with the amazing person she was. She had done things for me which no one had. She had helped me through depression. We both were really good friends. I wanted to confess my feelings for her, but she said one day that she had a boyfriend. Needless to say, I was heartbroken. But I wanted to see her happy. And as she was happy, despite being heartbroken, I felt a bit warm inside. 
A couple days later, she told me they broke up. I was a bit surprised really. We were better friends than ever. We even got a bit flirty at times. There were times, when I felt that she liked me back too. I mean, we'd both pop up an ""I love you"" in our conversations often, and there were no weird reactions or anything. 

But lately, I have been having some thoughts about her. Bad ones. Like, fantasies about kissing her, cuddling with her, you know, getting a bit physical.... a few sexual fantasies as well. I feel really guilty about all this. Like, really guilty. I feel like hitting myself, punishing myself when I have these thoughts. 

How do I stop them ??",29Aug2017,1
12,"About three weeks ago, a nephew of mine took his own life after suffering from depression. 

His father, my brother, is one of those people with a ""just get over it"" approach to any illness or issue. He literally said ""well what are you waiting for?"" to my nephew when he did talk about taking his own life. I hope this haunts my brother to the end of time. He's not a good person.

On top of that, my sisters (and brother) hid the date of my nephews funeral from me. I was close to him, and absolutely wanted to be there. I told my brother, mother and one sister that I wanted to be there. They decided amongst themselves that I shouldn't be there and nobody replied or gave me the date.

Why they did this? I came out of the closet years ago. And all of my family members are racist and homophobic.

But I can't help but feel guilt. I've had 3 glasses of champagne since then at a fundraising event. It was okay. And now I'm sitting here not sure if I should feel guilty or like I lost at something. I had a problem. I still have a problem. But complete sobriety wasn't for me. I'm ashamed... but only because I told so many people about going to AA. I feel like I lost credibility.

16,"Not sure if there are a lot of book readers here, but I just wanted to suggest people read a book called **The Forgotten Soldier** by Guy Sajer.

It's basically personal memoirs of Mr. Sajer when he was fighting on the eastern front of WWII for Germany. Sajer was pressed into serving into the Nazi military service at 16 years old. 

I realize that it's probably a bit...controversial to suggest a book that contains someone serving in the Nazi military in the current political climate, but his personal memoirs aren't anything political. It's about his experience with war -- his fighting, what he has to deal with mentally afterwards. I personally read it when I was in high school (Fucking 10+ years ago), I was a big WWII buff and my father, a 20-year soldier who served in a lot of campaigns himself, had read it before and told me to give it a try. 

When you're young like that, you kinda glorify war and vilify the 'bad' side. Reading that book made me realize that people who fought on 'bad' side are just as human as we are, that they have their own fears, thoughts, doubts -- that they're not all just robots who are hell-bent on world domination.

Anyways, the book isn't 100% historically accurate. Mr. Sajer wrote it in 1965, 20 years after the war ended, and memories fade. But even then, it isn't about historical accuracy for me, it's about him. ",29Aug2017,0
17,"I'm moving back in with my mom next Wednesday, and as a condition for me moving in, I have to give up weed until I finish college (I dropped out but I'm going back). I was a little pissed about this at first, but after thinking about it I think it's pretty reasonable. Going a few months without weed (I only have one term left) to focus on studying can only be beneficial, and it isn't going anywhere. I already smoked the last of my stash, so I'm going cold turkey from now until mid-December.

Gotta be honest, I don't like it.

I'm a bit of a basket case - I have Asperger's Syndrome, severe social anxiety, and struggle with depression to the point where I've attempted suicide and have had to be admitted to a psych ward for it. For me, reality is a dark, cruel, unforgiving place. Along with my wonderful dog, marijuana is one of the only things that makes the darkness go away, and allows me to smile without forcing myself to. I rarely feel as much excitement as I do when rolling a blunt, and I never feel as at peace with the world, or as happy with myself, as when I'm outside smoking. When I take a hit and hold the smoke in, letting it fill my lungs and take over my mind, I escape from my pitiful existence and feel content with the world around me. The trees seem to have a color and beauty to them they didn't before. Movies are more entertaining, games are more fun, and everything just feels more *alive*

In giving up weed, I feel I have to sacrifice happiness for productivity. It sounds terrible to say it, but I don't really think I can be happy without the influence of a mind-altering drug in my life, and without something to satisfy my oral fixation. When I'm not smoking weed, I'm vaping. When I'm not doing either, I feel restless and lost. Going outside feels pointless. Part of my person feels missing when I venture out into the world without my vape box in my pocket. 

I'm happy that I can still vape, and ultimately I think this is a necessary step if I want to live a productive life - 3 months isn't that long of a time, and I will devote 100% of my brainpower to completing my college degree so I won't have so much time to dwell on my thoughts. Still...I miss it. I miss it a lot. I miss sealing a blunt with my tongue, flicking the lighter and beginning a journey, the smoke in my lungs...

Oh well. We don't always get to have fun. I will do my best to keep smiling and get through this, and my sweet little doggie will definitely help. &lt;3",29Aug2017,0

21,"I pulled up into the petrol station where I saw a man on the ground whilst two teenagers surrounded him giving him CPR. The man's van was right next to him with his dog inside, the man's friend who was in a wheel chair was beside him on the phone.

The ambulance came and tried to resuscitate him with the defibrillator, his chest came up so high but he was so lifeless. I've never seen a dead body before, It was horrible I'll never forget it. His dog in the car was so scared and kept barking at his owner on the ground. 

What had happened was, the man was dying as he pulled up into the petrol station. The teenagers saw him and pulled him out onto the ground. That's what I heard from them. I couldn't stay as I had to move my car out of the way. I'm so sorry for his family and friends.",29Aug2017,15
22,"Am I asking too much of people and being negative or am I attracting selfish people?

I [27F] don't actually like any of my friends anymore. I have a few separate groups of friends who are completely different but I still seem to no longer enjoy their company for different reasons.

The group of friends I used to party with still party and smash lots of drugs every week. I still enjoy going out for a drink occasionally but I also can't be hungover or coming down all the time if I want to grow as a person. They're the kind of people who would always try to get me to pay for things if they could. They bitch about each other behind their backs and sleep with their ""friends"" crushes/gf without being upfront about it. They shoplift because they want to, not because they need to. They just seem like very selfish people tbh.

I have old uni friends but they're all so insecure and I guess ""alternative"" that they put down anything that's ""normal"". Like teasing me for buying a car... It's just a 2012 Renault... Nothing fancy. So I end up feeling really bad about myself after seeing them.

I have old work friends, who are generally good people but we just don't have much in common or to talk about. I'll catch up with them and mostly make small talk, but I don't find their company engaging.

I met some very intelligent people (all men) through my masters degree but they are very lacking in social skills (perhaps on the spectrum) and will talk *at* me about their interests for hours if they could, with no self awareness. They're also pretty misogynistic. As nice and well-meaning as they are it can be very tiring not getting a word in and hearing about war for 2 hours straight.

At this point, the only person I like is my gf who is amazing. She's smart, funny, fun, socially aware, generous, considerate... Everything I'd like in friends too. I've spoken to her about feeling this way, and how I've been feeling lonely and she agrees. She doesn't spend much time with her old friends either and would also like to meet new people. I guess it's worth mentioning we are both kinda shy and geeky.

I don't really have trouble making friends, but I don't seem to meet many people who are smart or passionate about something and also willing to put in as much as they take. I want to spend time with people with goals and who challenge me to learn more, grow and to be a better person.

**tl;dr** my friends are immature and selfish and I don't know how to meet people who aren't like that. As mentioned in the comments, if I'm attracting assholes by being one myself, I want to identify those traits in myself and change.",29Aug2017,2
23,"…and it was awesome.

It’s been nearly two weeks since it happened but man I still can’t get over it.

We knew each other because of chemistry camp, where we’ve only seen each other like once. And then a few months after I started talking to him, since apparently he’s a pretty cool guy. And then he added me on Snapchat. And then we talked about my sexuality, and then he started talking about his sexuality. And then he asked me out for lunch to go visit the city and I was like okay.

So that happened. And we ate lunch at a fancy Japanese place and it was good. And then… and then we went to a motel and I still didn’t know what to expect.

Then he was undressing me. Holy shit he was undressing me. It was totally surprising and yet, I totally consented because, because I was hinting and he was hinting towards it the whole time, that somewhere deep inside I was actually hoping this would fucking happen but then it started actually happening and it was *holy shit*.

And I totally liked it. No, I’m not going to make this read like porn, you can fill in the details yourself. It was nice, it was unexpected, but it was totally consensual and wow it was nice.

28,"I had a conversation with my soon to be fiancee, who has a 6 year old daughter.  I talked to her about how I wanted us both to model behavior that would set our children up for later success, that the way we live, is the easiest way to teach a child what a good life looks like.  I emphasized the importance if discipline, ambition, agency, and a desire, when one steps out in the world, not to simply do what you love, but to do what others love, to improve the world (that's what they pay you for, not to satisfy your own selfish desires, but to satisfy theirs).  She has a lot of good qualities, is very kind, honest, tolerant, has been a nurse for 15 years, is passionate about her role as a NICU nurse, and yet, she isn't all that passionate, she has stagnated.  Predictably, her response was similar to what mine would have been ten years ago when I took a paycut to do cancer research, ""Is money all that matters?  I save lives!"".  And, I said, ""No no no no.  That's not what I mean.  Of course what you are doing is valuable, but how about, putting yourself in a position to save even more children the next year.  Wouldn't you want to save even more lives?  I mean, I'm not sure how many lives you save, what's a typical year?"" ""I don't know.""  Bingo.  She never cared to measure.  Step past all the rhetoric, and what you find is someone that can't even bother to measure, who doesn't know which direction is up, in terms of self-improvement.  But, this isn't her fault, it's our fault.  She is a reflection of the zeitgeist.

One of the most often touted topics is the idea that we are ""softening kids up"" with participation trophies and an easy school system that doesn't challenge them.  This is how we absolve ourselves of responsibility as parents, just blame the school.  While we all know that ultimately, parents have a far greater impact on a child's success than a school, the complete lack of responsibility in parents today doesn't prevent them from blaming the schools, far from it.  

But, schools don't exist in a vacuum.  They exist to espouse the values that we all hold.  They are a reflection, and embodiment, of the values that we hold, and practice, as adults.  They are a proxy.  Going with this, we have to ask, what kind of attitude, or commonly excepted morale, do they symbolize with participation trophies?  They are a proxy for this attitude, ""I have a job and I'm a good person, sure, I don't strive for more, or to do better, nor do I even have a standard for what 'better' is, but isn't that good enough?  I participate, I have a job."".  If you want to know the source of the moral relativism that has led to the stagnation and degeneration of 2 generations of Americans, the repeated economic collapses, with many job seekers, but less and less jobs, look no further than that attitude.  It's the, ""Sure, I don't work that hard, and am not ambitious, but what I do is just as valuable as that guy making ten times as much as I do.  The system just hasn't figured out a way to measure my awesomeness yet.  If anything, that guy is selfish for making so much money.""  Yet, money is the only metric where we can't afford to lie to you.  Sure, they'll pat you on the head, tell you that you are a good person, but at the end of the day, the numbers on the paycheck is the system's only way of telling you the real value of what you do.  Do something that anyone would do, for free in some cases, then you aren't contributing, barely even participating, and this is why some have low salaries, while others do very well.  They are willing to do the work others won't, or can't.

A job is the lowest common denominator in a capitalist system (outside of outright unemployment).  You have three options, work for someone else, manage someone else, or own the entire business (or run a non-profit).  The pie in the sky we present to most kids is college and working for someone else.  Think about what that means.  To strive for the bottom rung, is exactly the kind of backward brained thinking that is risking the future of America, and to the extent this norm spreads, the future of the world.  Imagine stepping outside the framework of our perverse definition of ""normal"", and explaining to a sane human being travelling from a different time (or culture), that you are foregoing wealth, foregoing growth, foregoing meaning, foregoing the freedom to manage your life like a grownup, all to settle for the bottom rung, permanently.  We need more winners, less whiners, more initiators of change, less participants, more leaders, less followers, more college dropouts (of the Bill Gates variety), not more college graduates.  Business formation is at an all time low, and yet despite serious disadvantages, immigrants form them at a ratio of 2 to 1 compared to the average American, across all economic strata of business, from the gas station on the corner, to fortune 500 companies.  You don't have to look far to see what a visitor from mars would think of American attitudes, simply look at what people who enter our country, from the outside, think of our attitude.  It is reflected by their actions.

The reason this is important, is not because I require a child to be my proxy for success.  I have my own goals to reach, and would never expect someone to carry that burden for me.  Instead, it's about setting our children up for success.  I'm sorry to say, but I have a knack for predicting the future, and the bad news is, we are running out of participation trophies.  Our economy can't afford another generation of also rans, of people who are happy to sit at the bottom rungs, remaining bottom feeders, in complete denial of their actual misery.  We need more businesses, less workers.  Set a child up for a life lived with that kind of agency, and they will be able to navigate the oncoming storm of layoffs, and economic decay, and do very well, much like opportunistic businessmen cleaned up during the great depression (not everyone did poorly, some did very, very well, and often for good reasons, they didn't make excuses).  Give a child that kind of agency, and they will make it, and shine.  We must give them that kind of agency, through the example that we set.  And, we set this example by taking control of our lives, figuring out which direction is up, which metrics to measure ourselves with, and constantly improving, it's the only way.

If you want to know where kids are learning the kinds of soft values, and moral relativism that sets them up for a life of impotence, and complete lack of agency, do what I do, and search for the nearest mirror.

30,"Oh, yeah, I guess I should of mentioned I think hurricane Harvey was a message from God, Houston God knows how you were treating your poor.  You put the church in charge and they were not taking care of the homeless.  I heard, the homeless were only being housed 7 days and then dropped back on the streets.  The church was requiring mandatory prayers.  I heard testimony from a good woman, a mother of three, who is now a nursing assistant here in Austin.  She told me she chose her faith over shelter (she said she was not a follower of the church that was providing shelter and knew not to pray to a god that was not her own) and lived on the street for 30 days before escaping Houston. She told me of being treated cruelly and narrowly avoiding robbery and starvation in Houston.  She said she was provided no clothes and her husband was told to fuck off by a social service agent. Now, I don’t know what may not be understood by the words, we need everyone, but, God is not playing with any of us.  The poor is to be cared for humanely.  Listen rich people what you have comes from God and he can take it back and your life and won’t you feel foolish to lose your eternal life for a little cash? Heed, lest we switch places. And you don’t want me in your house, I will eat all your food, run up your light bill, watch all your porn and your pets will like me better than you.  Ask my friends, they’ll tell you this is true.  Also, Joel Osteen I knew you were a fraud, get right son or get wrecked.  Again, as Texas does, so should the rest of the U.S. and so should the all of the world.  Oh, leaders of Texas, you might want to get San Francisco on the phone and ask them what they do because though it might not be perfect SF is getting it in.  Also there was something cool I was supposed to write to Charlize Theron, but, I forgot- whatever Atomic Blonde was the shit. Stephen Colbert, pray to God he has a message for you, oh and you are the shit too. And Courtney Love, sister you are the real, pray to God but it’s going to break your heart, I’m sorry for that.

Before I get into the details, I’ll provide some background information. I am 21 years old, play bass in a band that tours regionally, and attend a large state university in the Midwest, where I’m studying German. My current life is generally good, but there is still one aspect which is lacking. I still have yet to have a steady girlfriend, and I find it somewhat frustrating. So far, I haven’t been able to meet a woman I’ve really been compatible with, and I’m not really sure how to go about it either.

With respect to women, I have always been a bit behind. I didn’t even kiss a girl until I was 19, and only lost my virginity a few months ago, at 21. So far, I’ve done things with four girls, but I only actually slept with most recent one. The rest I only got to make out with a couple of times. None of these girls hung around me for very long either, on average about a week before they stopped talking to me. However, losing my virginity has at least given me a little bit of confidence, before I was very depressed and upset about my lack of experience. Now that I’ve at least gotten that problem out of the way and actually had sex (albeit only twice), I want to meet someone I can properly date, someone who I naturally get along with, someone who'd get me caught up relationship experience wise. The problem is, I don’t know where I’d look.

For starters, I am a natural introvert and my social circle is quite small. The only people I hang out with on a regular basis are my three roommates, who are also musicians like myself. I don’t go out much, and I only really go to bars when my band is playing there. Mostly I just spend time at my house either smoking weed, playing guitar, or listening to records. My hobbies are fairly solitary and unusual as well, for example I learn ancient Germanic languages such as Old Norse and Gothic for fun. Currently, I don’t have any real outlet to meet women.

In addition, my worldview is quite different from that of most people where I live, and this greatly alienates me from the women there. My town is very left-leaning and full of hippies, while I tend to lean more towards the right (NOT Republican or Alt-Right though). This means that the majority of people where I live annoy the hell out of me. Most of the women around here won’t shut up about social “activism” or political causes that I’m sick of hearing about. Paradoxically, I still have the outward appearance of a hippie because I have really long hair, smoke weed, and play in a psychedelic rock band (here’s what I look like for reference: http://imgur.com/jVpj3iJ). Because I appear as a hippie at first glance, the only girls that have shown any interest in me are the hippie types, and thus I’d have to censor my true worldview in front of them. I feel like it would be difficult for a woman to fall for the real me.

Because to all of these factors, I don’t know what I should do. It’s hard for me to meet women, let alone any I’d actually have a genuine compatibility with. I mean, what woman would want to have a serious relationship with a weird, long-haired, introverted, right-leaning bass player who’s never had a proper girlfriend before and translates passages from Old Norse into English for fun? That one would probably be the weirdest chick ever, and she probably doesn’t even exist regardless. Anyway, would anybody have any advice for a guy like me? Should I keep trying my luck, or should I not worry about it for now? I also keep hearing that it's much harder to meet women after college. If I have such a difficult time now, when I'm still in school, how will I ever make it once I graduate? The following year or so may be my last chance.

EDIT: I have tried online dating, but to no avail. The girls on there that are near me aren't my type, and the ones who seem like they would be my type are always too far away.

44,"I just graduated and moved into my first apartment with a boy. I've been dating said boy for 5 years and he's a good egg. We are just happy. But I've come to the conclusion I'm also a hot mess. So much shitty stuff has happened to me since we've moved: I learned my license has been suspended for like 3 years, got pulled over because I forgot to renew the tags on my car, I cut my hand open and got tons of stitches, I have a horrible impulse buying addiction, my subtle depression after playing ME:A...it's been a rollercoaster. And it's only been 3 months. 

Today I texted my dad and just said ""I fail at being an adult"" I asked him if it ever gets better, or do I just get to a point where I am happy that I didn't fail as much as I did the day before? 

He says ""look who you are taking advice from, kid.""

He has two houses, a beautiful family, a great marriage, a boat...he rocks. But he still has those fail days too. He has had more stitches on the top of his bald head then anyone I've ever known- but that's him. He accepts it because he gets it- there is no right way to live. It's just your way, and until you understand what you want in life, you'll keep reaching for that ""adult"" you've always wanted to be but will never become. 

So yeah. I may suck at being an adult right now, but I am going to suck at with style and as long as I don't go to fucking jail, I think I'll be fine. You will too.

45,"I don't feel well. 
Last Saturday, after a 6.5h shift we were closing and a customer came up to me and wanted to go out wide with the shopping cart, which we do not allow past 8pm anymore, especially not when we're closing! 
They were not happy about it and I kept being calm, then the husband said something, which I didn't understood, so I asked shim to repeat it politely, then he goes ""you know damn well what I mean"" and I again, I tell him I just didn't understood what he said, and he repeats the same sentence again. He was being rude and a fucking brat since I said ""no"" to them. So I snapped. People should not talk like this to me, this is dehumanising or whatever, anyway. I raised my voice / yelled at him. Just a short sentence, I don't even remember what I said. 
But yes... I had an adrenaline rush and the security guard interrupted us and started to talk to them. I tried to calm down, waited for the door to be locked and walked away, since that was my shift. 
Anyway, now I'm kind of scared that I'll have consequences at my work. :/ I really don't want that, overall this never happened before with me, I'm 99% on time, or even a bit earlier. Of course there are instances when I'm late, usually it has something to do with the public transport then, and I do feel bad about it. 
Aw man. I just hope everything will be alright tomorrow. I don't know what to do. It wasn't a huge thing I believe. Was it? I mean I can't even remember what I said! I probably should have handled it differently, but I felt attacked by this guy, so my body just tried to protect me. But basically it's just an adrenaline rush and I can't control myself at this point.
