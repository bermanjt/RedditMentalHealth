3,"Like, this is obviously a throwaway account. And I've used it before. But I delete everything I've posted using it, even though it's totally anonymous. Why? Even if someone was to go through my post history (which probably wouldn't ever happen) why would it be so bad for them to get a small idea of who I actually am? I don't know.

I want to have a twitter account where I can just say what comes to my mind. Nothing particularly crazy or out there, probably boring for most. But then I think.... my parents will read that, my irl friends will read that, my coworkers will read that. So fucking what? I don't know. But that's what stops me. I feel like I've put on a face so much that I can't really take it off now, like that would be shocking for anyone. Like they'd care.

I want to be able to tell someone I feel like shit. I want to tell them I'm terrified of what's coming up in my future and that I have no idea what I'm doing. But I don't want to be _that_ friend that brings the party down. I want to talk to someone about my problems with self-control, but those are embarrassing and sometimes weird.

What I consider the most ""honest"" version of myself comes out when I'm high. It's a version of myself that kind of wants to reach out and say whatever to whoever, and can actually connect with someone I've known for only a relatively short time. I like myself when I'm high. But I can't be high all the time, cause I've got shit to do, and life to have. And it's not like I can really remember the time I spend high anyway. I want that guy to come out normally though. I don't know where he goes.

I want I want I want I want I want I want I want I want. I want to yell right now.",30Jul2017,3

6,"I just purchased some beautiful eggbeater pedals by crank bros to put on my 1978 Raleigh Competition GS that I inherited from my ex's father, and I can't figure out how to take off the old pedals. They don't have hex bolts, but it looks like a wrench might do the trick. Yet when I try to crank down on that baby, it won't budge.

I also feel like I'm trying to compromise to hard between passion and practicality. I'm working in sales and marketing, which I love, but I haven't played music, or have been on my standup circuit, or have photoshopped chicken heads onto people's heads in a long time. I'm only 23, so this should be a time to explore. But rent is due and exploring will risk it. Will I lose it all following my passions? Will I lose myself without those passions? The balance needs to be met somewhere.

Maybe I should just take the damn bike into the shop for the pros to work on.",30Jul2017,2
8,"I meet with old friends from time to time and I've been seriously thinking about telling them about my business or not. It's not that I would be ashamed - I'm not. Business is good. 
But I believe in the fact that no one should talk too much about business - people get envious and even too curious about certain aspects. 

I would want to talk about it only because I don't want to lie about working somewhere else ( it would turn out even worse if they would find out I am lying ) , but I don't want to give them details about my business either. 
So if I tell people that I'm the co-founder of a videochat firm, how can I politely tell them that I don't want to give out any details about it ? ",30Jul2017,1
10,"It's 3:00 p.m. one summer day and we're doing what any normal teens would be doing. We're riding around our small Florida town drinking beer. Tim's in the passenger seat of his prized canary yellow Ford Mustang. Not a classic, but one of the ugly 90's model 5.0's. His hot, blonde, eighteen-year-old girlfriend's at the wheel. Tim's nineteen or twenty years old. One of my good friend's and I are in the backseat. We were both seventeen. After we'd all had five or six beers, except the girlfriend who hadn't had anything, Tim and I get into an argument about whether or not he's drunk. I asked him why his girlfriend was driving if he was sober. So he tells her to pull over and he stumbles to the driver side and gets behind the wheel. 

He's clearly drunk, so I tell him to take me home. Within a few feet we reach a stop sign and He turns left. He goes up one street and turns left onto my street. We're less than a block away from my house now. Feeling proud of himself he turns and looks at me and says, ""See I'm not drun..."" ""Bang!"" The car goes from about 20 mph to a dead stop, because of a pesky guardrail over a small ditch. I slam into the back of the passenger seat and send his girlfriend flying headfirst into the windshield. My friend in the back crashes headfirst into the back of Tim's seat and then slumps over. Tim and myself are uninjured; we sit quietly for a moment hoping to hear the other two speak. Tim asks his girlfriend if she's okay and she says yes. I look over at my friend and he's not moving, his eyes are closed and he will not respond. Tim gets out and he's yelling and crying about the fact that his car is totaled. I tell his girlfriend to get rid of the beer and run to the closest house to call for an ambulance. When I return I notice she's taken the beer out of the cooler and thrown it into the ditch, right there past the guard rail we hit, I pause to consider the fact that she's a dumb blond, but for now I'm more concerned with my friend. I lean into the car and call his name and he sits up and smiles. (What a jerk.) I want to move the beer, but a policeman rounds the corner before I can. After asking us if everyone is okay, and checking the head wound, where Tim's girlfriend is bleeding, and discovering it's only a scratch he notices the beer, still frosty, in the ditch. He questions us and mocks our attempt to hide it as we deny any knowledge of where the beer came from.  

He has us three passengers sit on the opposite gaurdrail and proceeds to administer a feild sobriety test on Tim, who's still whining about his car. First, the policeman orders him to walk a straight line. Tim fails. We begin to whisper to one another, ""He's going to jail."" Next he tells Tim to stand on one leg and look up. He once again fails. ""Yep, he's going to jail,"" we whisper. Finally the officer tells him to count to twenty by two's. Tim pauses and looks off to one side and back at the officer, Tim's eyes were squinted and his mouth all twisted in frustration. He looks at the policeman and says ""Look, I've done everything you've asked me to do, but I'll be damned if I'm going to stand here and do algebra for you!"" We all laughed out loud. The officer looked at us and we composed ourselves. ""He's going to jail,"" we repeated. The officer looked and Tim and said, ""You screwed up your car, I think that's enough punishment for one day. Go sit down."" Tim didn't go to jail.   ",30Jul2017,1
12,"I've been reading a lot more posts/comments on Reddit lately, and I've noticed a pattern that is kind of starting to irritate me. Nearly everyone speaks about themselves in complete abstractions all the time. What do I mean? I'll give you some examples.

'In my country...' Ah, this one is ubiquitous. Really? You can't even name the country you're from? Surely it can't be unsafe to mention something that broad. 'In New Zealand' or 'In Estonia' wouldn't hurt once in a while, would it?

'I work for this company...' Oh really? Well that narrows things down. I get that you might not want to say the specific company name, but how about the industry? Or will Big Brother's cronies hunt you down if you dare to disclose that you work in Software? 

'I moved city recently...' Heaven forbid you should say where you moved from or to. I guess you have to keep everything as an abstraction, or else it won't sound as cool huh?

You get the picture. It's struck me as a bizarre idiosyncrasy of Reddit. It seems like everyone is either trying super hard to be anonymous, and over-compensating, or else trying to make themselves sound cool by describing their lives in lofty abstractions that make them sound like the blurb on a Jodi Picoult novel.

Anyway, excuse me while I get back to the job I have at that company I work at in the country I'm from.",30Jul2017,3
13,"Two of my best friends started dating about a year ago. I've known them both since kindergarten and consider them. It's family. I've always wanted the best for both of them.

14,"Hello, I am building this website using wordpress and genesis theme.

I am struggling because this is all pretty new to me, so it's still a work in progress. It will continue to get better, but this is what I have done so far: https://producelove.com/

I need to implement social login / sharing better. I want there to be a user database and registration process so I can get a community started, along with a forum for users to interact on.

I'm not sure that I have it set up right with regards to the login and user management. There isn't a section for users to login, logout, or modify their profile. I'm not sure how to build that yet.

What do you think overall? Any genuine criticism or feedback is much appreciated!

15,"I'm visiting my parents for a few weeks and noticed that what was once a quiet residential street has instead turned into a speedway and place where drunks have moved in and come to park their cars while they stumble off to a commercial street a few blocks away. 

Vehicle after vehicle after vehicle roar down the street, blowing by the stop sign at the intersection and on through the next block despite a park on one side (20 mph speed limit).   You what that causes?  Noise, dust, irritation.  It also makes living in the once quiet residential street less desirable.  Less desirable means the property values could take a hit.  So because a bunch of motorists don't want to wait at 2 traffic lights on the commercial street and instead think it's ok to blow through stop signs in 20 mph zones, the rest get to suffer.  The city tried to take traffic calming measures with speed bumps and street narrowing tactics like placing big planters but the reckless driving continues.   

Another thing that irritates me to no end is a young couple (early 20s) who are frequently outside at night on their rooftop terrace and laugh it up, are loud, in short disturb the peace.  The worst was tonight.   It's 01:30am and I hear some drunk men and women yelling (I'm sleeping in a bedroom that's adjacent to their terrace) ...first I go check out the street, nothing...I go upstairs and boom!  So loud, they must have drunk guests over or are drunk themselves?   Either way, I got so pissed off, I went to wake up my sleeping parents (that didn't go over well) and asked them how do I close the rooftop window..it's stuck?   It was stuck open and those loud ass drunks' voices were streaming inside.

Dad goes outside, closes the window from the outside..apparently the window crank was broken.  He's in his boxers, me in some pants I just pulled on.  I go out onto the deck I shone a light at the terrace hoping someone would notice...well there was some drunk girl with her back to me and so I had to do something.   I yelled out to get someone's attention. Yes, I could have been more calm but I made it clear to to them that they needed to take the party inside.  I really didn't need this tonight.  I need to get some rest, have a busy day Sunday and then need to be rested to hit the road early Monday morning for a long trip to two out of town interviews.   Damn it I hate loud obnoxious drunks who feel it's ok to be that way in residential neighborhoods.   Yes I'm wearing earplugs.  I'm even using a white noise machine now.  But why should I have to?  Why can't I sleep with the windows open?    Is it reasonable for others to enjoy their nights , laugh and yell while makes others' nights hell?   

My parents worked hard to be able to afford their home, they don't deserve this.  Now I'm going to have to face dealing with those (almost) next door neighbors.  I can't wait to move out and never see them again.   ",30Jul2017,2
16,"I don't have anyone else to tell.  I didn't win the lotto or get an inheritance, it's just my life savings.  I'm 40 and alone, which is probably the main reason I was able to do it.  I'd rather have a family I could have been sharing it with than to be as lonely as I am with my big pile of money though.

It's true money doesn't make you happy past a certain amount but it does make you comfortable, and having been hungry when I was younger, I'm very grateful to be able to be as comfortable as I am now, even though I'd still trade most of it for someone to share the rest with.

19,"I used to be a, 'respectable man of god'. I volunteered on Sunday, read the Bible periodically and abstained from premarital sex until age 23. I eventually came to the conclusion Christianity is used as a tool to cope with mortality and was started as a means to control ancient and primitive people. The Bible has been retranslated am innumerable amount of times and no original texts exist. How is one supposed to love and fear God if there is no fear in love according to the Bible? Does the Christian God suffer from cognitive dissonance or was it poor translation?  Also, It's impossible to follow all the rules of the ideology and 'grace' is bullshit. It creates a dynamic where you always feel you're doing wrong and feel a need to constantly ask for forgiveness. I feel if there is a need to worship a fictional character then why not worship Superman? Superman saved the planet numerous times where as Jesus has threatened to return and end the earth just to no show. Also Superman would save you if you were falling to your death whereas Jesus would not and send you to spend eternity in hell if you don't believe in him. I'd say Superman sure beats the fuck out of Jesus! In other words, I no longer follow an ideology based on an incoherent story about a god that gave people free will, punished them for using free will and then sacrificed himself to himself for sins he created. Lastly, why does an all powerful god that created the universe need money? Christianity is a fucking joke.",30Jul2017,3

He came into my room, said ""you're being too loud"" and started hitting me and beating me for almost a minute. I'm shaking and choking from tears right now. I can't go on like this. I grew up with my older brother constantly abusing me physically and mentally. I always have to hide my bruises and eyes swollen from crying when I go somewhere, for example, to school. I can't defend myself, I'm really tiny compared to him. He works out and his punches hurt very much. He also always says how he wants to kill someone, how he hates people, how he wants to get ""revenge"" and many other things like that. He went to the therapist, took pills for depression for a long time and it didn't help at all. The situation is even worse now. Once when I was, I think, 10 years old and home alone with him, we were in the kitchen and he pulled out a knife and started threatening me. He didn't do anything because I quickly put on my shoes and went outside. I'm terrified. My parents know. He beats them too.

24,"The little ginger fuck was just creeping through the field, probably trying to eat the fuck out of some birds or some shit, and I walked right passed him - he was in the field next to the sidewalk about 20 feet away. 

He stopped and looked at me. I stopped and looked at him. He didn't move. 

*Note: I bought meat and was carrying it home so he probably smelled food and had been fed by humans before, he lives close enough to a residential area that it's possible someone's tossed him a burger here and there. 

I lamented that I didn't bring my camera to shoot him or the beautiful bluejay I passed earlier on the way to the store (Seriously man, the one time I don't have it on me. Fuck my dickhole), but I was curious. 

I know foxes are dangerous, but really this guy was roughly the size of my sister's cat, if he bit me I could just hoof him in the ribs and obliterate him. I'm like 200 pounds, It takes like 10 foxes and a fat dog to make me, I think I can take the little furry shit.

He didn't budge until I was about halfway to him, then he wandered away, a little skittish. But still, he didn't run, so I held still for a good two minutes, and he wandered around me towards the tree by the fences. I approached again. 

I got real close when birds took off from the tree he was approaching. He didn't give chase, instead he saw me. 

I tiptoed closer and closer, until I was almost arm's length away. I crouched down and outstretched my hand, and let him sniff. He walked on an angle kind of to go around me, and I ran my hand along his back as he passed. He stopped and looked at me like ""the fuck do you think you're doing"", so I pet him again, and scratched behind his ears for a second, then he wandered away and took off. 

His fur was dull and coarse, like a wild dog's, and he seemed young, probably still a baby. I'd assume his parents died or something, but I don't know much about foxes, maybe they really do go off alone from that age to hunt and survive. 

I hope you caught that bird lil ginger-bro. Gods speed. ",30Jul2017,5

I can't seem to work through my own murky emotions to figure out what I want and it has been draining. I don't have anyone to talk to about it and talking to my boyfriend is like walking a minefield. 

I don't feel like his girlfriend anymore. I feel like a caretaker for him. He doesn't help with chores during the week. He doesn't save any of his money. He does the bare minimum to help take care of my dog. I know that's not his responsibility, but he wants to get another dog. Why should I bring in another pet if he can't help with the one we have? Not to mention we are not on the same page life wise.

However, anytime I finally get the guts to talk things out with him he does something that throws me off. He finally starts to do something that I've asked him to do forever. Then I start to wonder if I'm overreacting or generally second guessing myself.

38,"Hey everyone! So I'm new to Reddit and I have this odd question/favor I want to ask of anyone who is interested in participating. This might be weird..but here it is. So my boyfriend is a HUGE Reddit fan, and by huge I mean he literally spends almost all his free time on it. We've been together 7 years now and Reddit has been a part of his life for 5(well almost 5 because all I've been hearing lately is how is Reddit 5 year anniversary is coming up). Well anyways, fast forward to this morning.  He was on Reddit and I was kind of just sitting there, bored, going through all my other social media that he very much hates(Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter). I thought to myself, why the fuck do I not have Reddit? He talks about it constantly and everything is far more interesting than what freakin Sally Sue has to complain about every damn day. 
So after finally signing up I didn't put front tell him that I got Reddit. I'm scrolling through the front page and happen to laugh at a post that I of course can't remember at the second and I can't exactly ask my boyfriend this second lol. Anyway, he asked what I was laughing at and I replied with what I read and he goes ""You just got Reddit didn't you?"" of course he asks me what my username is and this is where this post comes into play. I obviously told him I'm not going to tell him and he has to figure it out himself. My username will definitely click when he sees it/finds out. 
A little insight to my username, I hope to be a chef one day owning a 5 star restaurant. My life revolves around food and trying to please people through my cooking.

50,"I (21F) live on a college campus.  My roommate (22F) decided to order some food instead of cook, so she plugged our address into the website and ordered food.  

The delivery guy was supposed to show up about 20 minutes later with the food, but parked at a small shopping center across the street and called my roommate.  He told her where she was parked and told her to come get the food.  My roommate told him that she expected him to deliver the food all the way to her, because the other delivery services in the area have no problem doing so.  

He then began to verbally assault her over the phone, telling her that he wasn't going to budge, calling her names, and telling her that she had given him the wrong address (it was correct).  After 15 minutes of yelling, another person (M) at the shopping area across the street realized what was going on and tried to explain it to the driver, but the driver refused to do anything.  Between the three of us (roommates and wonderful helpful man), we managed to get him to drive on campus.  He saw us and drove over.  

We expected him to apologize when he got out of the car and give us the food, but he yelled at her as she approached, kept saying she had given him the wrong address (once again, it was correct, we checked), waved his arms around, and wouldn't give her the food until she understood.  I butted in at this point and said, ""Buddy, give her the food.""

He gave her the food, but we didn't feel safe walking back inside the building until he had driven away (and also, they're supposed to *drive away*), but he kept yelling at us as we walked back to the building.  We stood in the doorway and I started screaming at him in my most aggressive voice to drive away, I'll call the police, drive the fuck away, etc.  He finally did and gave us the finger.  

We're planning on calling the business tomorrow (mostly because they only gave her a $5 gift card to the same business and she never wants to order from there again).  

I just feel like shit.  My roommate just wanted food, we didn't want to feel like shit because of it.  A delivery driver's job is to *deliver.*  It's not okay to verbally assault a customer, and I'd argue that there was some physical aggression in there too with his refusal to drive away.  I shouldn't have to feel scared to give somebody a piece of my mind.  And I absolutely should feel safe on my own campus.  ",30Jul2017,8
