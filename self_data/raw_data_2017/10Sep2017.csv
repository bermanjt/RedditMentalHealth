That fat piece of shit would fly away just before I swatted it. Then I had half a Lindt chocolate bar sitting on my side table sitting with one end slightly raised by some papers. It landed on top, making stupid fly sounds with its greasy asshole legs on the foil wrapper. I saw my chance. I grabbed a Kleenex box that was nearby as my swatter just as the sloppy fuck walked around the bar underneath! I struck quickly and violently, crushing the dirty shitsucker under the chocolate bar. I briefly considered wiping off his greasy fly blubber and eating the chocolate bar, but I decided I didn't want to eat something he soiled with his dirty fly corpse.

This time, she told me to stay.
It was another empty moment,
Just like yesterday.

I saw what she said,
And he answered my dread.

And the gods, they claim their own.

9,"A few weeks ago, a childhood friend of mine committed suicide. He was 24 years old, and lost an ongoing battle with PTSD. His funeral was today. Unfortunately, I find myself stationed 800 miles away and was unable to attend. 

We hadn't spoken much in recent years, but had remained on good terms. Before he enlisted, we'd been relatively casual friends. Better than acquaintances, not good friends, but like... pleasantly aware of each other's existence. And a couple years later, when I graduated and enlisted, that bond became much stronger. Even in two vastly different lines of work, we had a shared bond. I can recall several occasions where we had shockingly mature conversations, which was pretty unexpected out of us both.

These past few weeks have been... different. As I'd said, we hadn't spoken much. A month ago, he was alive and we never talked. But today, he's not alive and we still don't talk. And it's somehow different. So many times I visited home in the last few years, and we never saw each other. ""No worries, I'll catch you next time."" Except I won't, because he's not home anymore.

Sure, I'm only a senior in high school, so I still have time. But at the same time, I feel like holding off on that type of stuff. I definitely don't want to get my liver and brain fucked up nor do I want to get arrested for something dumb like having illegal pics of titties.

15,"Quick backstory: My parents moved to Florida almost 10 years ago from NY. My mother has mental illnesses including anxiety, depression, OCD, and paranoia. She believes that terrorists in the middle East are creating electromagnetic missiles that will hit the US. She had my father get freeze dried rations and a solar generator. Mom has been widowed for almost three years and is the guardian of my severely autistic sister. My mother has this thing where if she doesn't know how to do something, she just won't do it or try to learn. It's a miracle she can even open a jar.

I called my mother today to check in and she what she plans to do about the storm. I live in NY so I am not able to help prep. She proceeds to tell me:

1. She only got candy, peanut butter, crackers, bread, and soup as nonperishables. My sister might not even eat any of that. Now I'm worried my sister will starve if they lose power for a long period of time. The stores are cleaned out so it's too late now. She thinks the stores will be perfectly fine after the storm because they have generators.

2. They have a barbeque, but she doesn't know how to use the burner to cook the soups. Since this is my mother, she won't try to figure it out.

3. There was a tropical storm last year that took a few shingles off the roof. What did my mom do about it? Nothing. The roof is almost 10 years old. Didn't board the windows, hope those hurricane resistant windows can withstand 110+ mph gusts and the debris with it!

4. The solar generator is ""not working"": she says the light on it isn't coming on. Either the battery is old, or she isn't operating it correctly. Google the issue you say? See #2, she's even worse with computers.

5. She is debating keeping her only car in the garage because if the power goes out she doesn't know how to manually open the door, let alone where the key is. She's lived there for almost 10 years.

I have been trying to rack my brain the last few hours as to what on earth her thought process is on all this. You're one step away from a bunker for nonexistant middle eastern EMP missles, but when a legit major hurricane is coming, you buy a few munchies and hope the roof doesnt get destroyed?

She even said if the house is destroyed, she'll quickly try to buy a new house. (which good luck finding another one that isn't damaged) She has wanted to move out for a while, and I think she wants this to happen to make it quick, at the expense of her safety and more importantly, my severely disabled sister's safety. I am completely helpless and useless to this situation while up in NY. The truly sad part is my brother lives 30 minutes away and has done absolutely nothing to prep.  Didn't board up the windows, didn't help move the outdoor furniture, didn't help with the generator. When I asked him earlier this week about the coming storm, ( granted the forecasts were not as certain) he gave me a huge attitude. (to quote him: ""what are you worried about exactly? Mom can just stay at a friend's house if the power goes out."")

The other reason she may be doing this is that her mental illnesses are completely impending her self-preservation abilities. The biggest problem I have with all this is while my mom has a right to destroy her life, my sister doesn't have that ability to choose. 

People talk about what'd they do if they had a million dollars: many would buy material things, or maybe give to a charity. I would use it to get my sister out and seek to have my mother placed in treatment. But yet, I live paycheck to paycheck and have nothing to lean on to gain custody.

But I'll be using it to defend everyone and everything living in my home and that makes me extremely uneasy.

I can smell the oil I used to clean my firearm. I can smell the food in the kitchen. My eyes are precise and relaxed. Body feels fluid. Also... ummm...

18,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a year, and we are both seniors in high school. We are incredibly close and we spend a lot of time together. However, when the topic comes up, he's decided that he's ""not going to take any of this with him to college."" So we know that it is determined that we will break up right before college starts. It feels so strange to think about, though, because we spend so much time together and we get along so well. It makes sense though, because both of us are very academically successful students and I would never want to limit him in his pursuits. It just hurts a little bit that he believes that he will simply leave behind everything, including a long term relationship with someone he says he loves. 
To anybody who has experience with this, what are your thoughts? How do I not let this impending date affect how I feel in this relationship too much? (Because frankly, ever since we had that conversation, it's been bothering me.)

21,"I've taken 6 Lyfts this week since the article came out about Uber being under federal investigation for spying on Lyft drivers. Each driver 1) had not heard the story yet and 2) all said basically the same thing, that they aren't surprised about it. They all did both Uber and Lyft and they all seemed really indifferent about the possibility that they could've been spied on by Uber.

This is one example of a trend I've been noticing. It seems like in the last ten years (give or take), after we've all known about the Patriot Act, the NSA spying on citizens, etc. that more and more people just seem to be fine with having their privacy and their civil rights violated. I've thought about social media and how everything seems to be public these days and how that is probably a large contributing factor to this mindset. 

I cannot understand how people can be fine with things like this. I believe we should have a right to reasonable privacy and not being susceptible to being spied on without consequences. Maybe a large part of people being okay (or at the very least indifferent) with it is the feeling that they cannot do anything to stop it. Even if we are powerless to stop it, I still firmly believe that we should at least try to take a stand and object to it. It's deplorable that companies and our government can cross these boundaries, often times with no repercussions to them.

I wish that we as a society would take a stand and demand change. I fear that it's just going to keep getting worse and that the widespread mindset of indifference is just going to allow things to keep going downhill.",10Sep2017,1

I act like it doesn't bother me that he deleted all the voicemails from the first girl without asking me, I only found out way after the fact because he was proud he did it so he could get me out of a relationship that he didn't like. I didn't like it either but I don't like that he did that. I don't like that when I brought a friend of mine home for prom he asked ""what are you doing bringing a fat black chick to prom?"" He was joking but he was serious, and she was probably one of the nicest girls I I've gotten close to involved with.
I don't like that he forced me to leave you. I don't like him in many ways, and for many things he's done.

In the dream you came over to my parents house while my dad and grandfather were over. Both of us were fighting back tears, a lot like when you came back the first time. except this time I didn't ask if I could hug you, I just pulled you close because it's what I wanted. You looked like you were beginning to cry and it felt so good to hold you again. But they my dad came in yelling and screaming about what was going on. I told him to go away and he did, then it was just us again. As we spoke I found that we were kissing and getting more intimate. Even if only a dream feeling you again was one of the greatest feeling's I've had in a long time. But he started yelling again but this time I went to confront him but when I walked through the door I found my self in an underwater tunnel. At the end of the tunnel was a savage and ruthless looking shark. Not scared because it had lost a fight. He slammed his head against the glass over and over trying to get to me. Trying tear into me but I turned away before he could. I went back to you, I saw you laying on the the couch now with earbuds in looking at your phone. Truth be told I was frustrated that we were no longer being intimate because I wanted you still but, I walked over to you and you smiled at me and I laid down beside you. And I was happy. 

I know that we had an ""abusive relationship"" bbut I miss you. I feel like a failure and loser for breaking up with you twice. I know that we likely wouldn't have worked out at in the long run and that's partly why I left but I really didn't want to. I loved you. Sometimes it still hurts when I think about it. You know me , I base most of who I am on the men I see in films. Heroes who never give up on anyone, or anything, and save the day. But I couldn't. I tried for as long as I could to help you but I gave out. For the longest time I thought I was strong. I would heroically tell myself, ""When all else, I will not."" I'd tell myself, ""Nothing will crush my chest,"" but the irony that my chest crushed itself. 

Maybe I'm not a hero, I would like to think of myself as one, as I'm sure most do, but I don't what that means anymore.  I thought it meant you save all the people you know, I thought it meant you work out and have big muscles, but I don't work out and I don't have big muscles. I thought maybe that being a good boyfriend who helped you through your traumatic past and took care of you, and loved you would make me feel like a hero, but it didn't. Now I feel like a failure. A man who gives up when it's hard and runs away, back to the safety of parents. And what right does a cowardly man have telling stories of epic heroes? A man who runs from that which cannot conquer or what he can't save? Or maybe that's exactly who a storyteller is. A coward who can only dream of the hero he'd love to be while quivers in the shadow of self loathing and doubt.",10Sep2017,1

He had surgery last night, is recovering today, but having to wait several hours between updates is killing me. I know he's 'only a cat' but me and the wife haven't been able to have kids, he's 9 years old, and I'm in absolute bits over it.

He's not eaten since the surgery, and they obviously need to make sure things are ok so are having to keep him in. I can't eat, I can't sleep, and I just feel a mess. I'm terrified he'll have complications from surgery and won't make it. Terrified.

I'm hopeful he's going to recover ok, but I just can't face the thought that he might not. I'm terrified at the costs... it's looking at a few thousand quid in vets bills already, having to use an out of hours emergency vet is incredibly expensive. I'd pay every penny I own to have him home and healthy again. I think any future holidays might be put on hold for a while.

I'm just struggling with the stress. My life is stressful enough as it is, I work long hours, I have a house that needs so much work doing to it, I just needed somewhere to write things down. 

Seeing his face light up everyday when I come home gives me the motivation to keep going. He's only been at the vets for 24 hours, but it feels like a part of my life is missing. 

I have so much that I need to do, but all I can do is just sit here staring in to space. It's taken me hours to get myself together to write this.

And yes, I've learnt my mistake about pet insurance. We'd never had a vet bill more than a couple of hundred quid before this - we've got 4 cats in total, 3 of them love my wife and tolerate me, the other, the one in question, is mine, and loves me unquestionably.

I can't believe I trusted her and loved her as much as I did. I needed compassion from someone else when I met her, and she was the only female who ever took the time to understand me. Not that she understood any of my emotions or could empathize with her privileged life.

It's ripped away in a heartbeat. Word of advice: when you really just want to break-up with a partner, *don't try and wean your way out with an open relationship*. It doesn't work, and the moment they replace what little love they still have for you with someone else, it will hurt you like nothing else can.

No one wants to see anyone this vulnerable. Casual sex doesn't even help with the coping - especially when you're too fucking depressed to even get it up. And there's no impressing a potential partner when you're such a fucking shell of a person that wants to ask anyone and everyone to just share a bed for the night to help alleviate that gaping sadness in your heart.

But seriously, fuck her. Fuck her and her happiness, her intelligence, her fucking money and easy life. Fuck her for not wanting to use drugs to find that one sense of blurry easiness that only childhood once gave you. Our relationship wasn't perfect - it was only bound to happen eventually. But why the fuck did she have to call the cops on me, and make me resort to finding a bed with a fucking stranger while rolling at 12 AM. The only person I've ever loved treats me like an intruder, and chases me out onto the street.

I'm losing whatever friends I have left. It's hard enough to make new ones, and each subsequent rejection is killing my hope step by step. I don't want to end up like the basket of mental illness that plagues my family, and I thought I was too bright and optimistic to go down that path.

If only people were nicer. If life were easier. If more of these filthy fucking rich souls I've surrounded myself with actually knew what desperation feels like.

So, I always thought this is the original idea for couple. Let's say girl looks like Felicity Jones http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/TheWrap+Awards+Season+Screening+Series+Presents+LmANvnU1QCTx.jpg (I don't like motherly figures of older girlfriends) and guy is cute, skinny, curly hair, baby face, maybe short. (Dane Dehaan https://i.pinimg.com/736x/36/d4/7b/36d47b7bb0ffa4f49ba150803a42fcaa--guy-celebrities-celebs.jpg). Maybe she seduced him, acts as teacher or tutor figure. Also maybe sexually dominates him but not in extreme femdom dominatrix sense. Also maybe he feels subordinate to her a bit. Maybe she is taller a few inches?

Actually earlier version of this fantasy were with 18 yr old guy and 24 yr old girl finishing college, and then she brings his shy ass into her subculture (hipsters, alt girls, preppy, maybe hardcore punk, that kind of liberal urban or suburban shit, but sometimes girlfriend was rich spoiled girl hah) and they tease a girl for young boyfriend... Ok I admit when I was 16 I wanted to be with college girl like that. We won't go any lower.

It's something that I would watch in a movie, idk. Maybe set in suburban area like in british series like Misfits or Skins. Not too trashy though.

So I maybe wanted to be that guy. But ironically in early 20s I was in happy long relationship. Now at 25 I must act differently and if I get 29 yr old girlfriend it's not the same. One problem with me being that guy is that I am much taller than any girl, 6'1"".But I am ectomorph.
