0,"I just don't get it anymore. I can have a crush on a guy, and then when he starts showing even the slightest bit of interest in me I freak out and dread every interaction with him! When a friend confesses to having a crush on me, I can never look at them the same way again (I've had both male and female friends fall for me and I've reacted the same way every time, so I know it's not just a men thing). I know I can feel sexual attraction, but I wonder some days of I'm even capable of romantic attraction, of romantic love.


I don't understand it. I wonder if I'm aromantic, or perhaps afraid of commitment. I mean, my parents have always had a very turbulent relationship. They're still together, but they fight at least 3 or 4 times a week and call each other names and all sorts of things, I won't get into the gritty details. Perhaps growing up in a house like that has left the impression on me that this is what I have to look forward to if I fall in love? (Side note, I have Asperger's/ASD if that helps explain anything.)


Tl;dr I get super uncomfortable when people want to date me and it's really starting to freak me out.


Please, if anyone can give me any sort of answer about this or a way to fix it if this is as much of a problem as it feels like, it would lift a great weight off my shoulders",29May2017,3

Life is beautiful, enjoy the life. There is no time to be sad, to bother yourself with stupid things. Be happy with that what you get everyday.

Sunny Monday. Timothy decides to go on a beach after work. Today he ends exactly at the time he should, so he can enjoy good weather. Tim takes off his boots, rolls up pant legs and slowly walks on strand. He's going very close to water, so sometimes it touches his feet. Timothy strolls and thinks about the life. It is beautiful, isn't it?

Children jaunty splash themselves in the water. Curious thing is how adults look at them. They would want to do the same. But in some reasons they play 'serious guys' and just sit watching at them. Dreaming to be child again. Look how fast is the life going. Do you remember your childhood? You may say it was recently. But, no - it was 10, 15, 30 years ago, or even more. Important question is: did you make use of your life?

Thank God, beach is place where we can meet more awesome people. The time is slowed here. Humans stop for a while, take a rest. Perhaps some of them come here to consider very difficult thoughts. Timothy Leist isn't the only one who knows how to slow down and enjoy surrounding scenery.

Timothy backs home by bus. He is sitting next to a woman who is sitting next to window. So Timothy stays on her exit way. She look to be around 50 years old, well-educated. She reads a book, Tim can't see cover with a title. After reading few words of this book, he recognizes it's about faith. Is she looking for God, did she turn away from God? Millions questions come to Tim's mind. Maybe she is just a person who treats this book like any other. Anyway, faith is an interesting subject to talk about. 

Someone listens loud music in back seats. It hurts others passengers ears. Timothy looks behind to see who is this. Young man, thin, wearing shorts, t-shirt and a basketball cap. He's so cocky, so any conversation with him would be pointless. These people must exist somewhere on the planet. We just have to deal with it. World needs valueless people. Woman sitting next to Timothy is lucky, because the bus approaches her bus stop. She closes book and stands up. Literally she forces Tim to let her pass without a single word - 'excuse me'. Looks like well education does not mean mannerly person. 

Timothy returns home after that wonderful journey.  Jack is already waiting for him. His bowls are empty, so the first thing which Timothy does is giving food and water to Jack. Then Tim eats dinner and of course a together stroll after. It's been few days since Jack lives with Tim and still no new friends for him. Timothy does not want to leave him alone after his death. Now you should realize why Tim is alone, he doesn't even look for a girl. It's simple, he wouldn't want to leave her alone, to let her suffer. 

To be continued.

6,THIRD YEAR IN A ROW THAT I LOSE A PET. I DESERVE AN AWARD THIS TIME IT WASNT GUT CANCER.,29May2017,3
7,"My ex girl friend and I where dating for over 2 years. We first meet when she moved to Ireland from Spain to do her Erasmus. I am currently living in Ireland and she is living in Spain. We broke up over a year ago but talk daily. We still do things together when I'm in Spain, like go for drinks just the two of us, dinners, and hang out etc, even go to her house and help her write her thesis and If she has problems in life she will tell me. She tells me I am her best friend and say things like "" you know i really love you"". I really do still love her and feel she is my best friend and feel we only broke up because of the distance and noting else. But the problem is she a new boyfriend. They have been dating for 9 months. I've meet him and gone drinking with him etc and think he is a really nice guy but I really want to try and get my ex girlfriend back. Like of course they had there fights and sometimes she feels a bit overwhelmed and wants her own space by him ( she tells me) not that hes bad or that. But they do seem on Instagram etc to be in a good relationship. Last week he was away in his home country and I was in Spain. I notice how when he was gone she would meet me far more and it really felt the way we where when we were in a relationship (messing, falling over each another, meeting in the middle of the day, laughing and I even stayed at her house one night after we went for drinks) in a different bed of course. The night we went for drinks we talked for hours and there was never an silence etc. My ex gf still is jealous when I meet a girl I had a thing with years ago and cant really hang out with us all together cause she feels it makes her feel uncomfortable. She tells me she would love to come to Ireland but cant cause shes not able. She would rub my arm when where talking sometimes like and then stop ( i said you would like to keep rubbing my arm but you know you cant cause we both know its wrong ?) and shes says noting but laughs. We even talked about the habits we had during sex. But she does seem happy in her relationship too Even though they had a fight about a month ago and broke up for a day she talked to me straight away because she was feeling sad. She says she can tell me anything and I feel the same about her. I'm just a bit confused cause i don't know what to do. Cause i do miss her. Like i know if she was single we would definitely be having sex and id say we would 99 percent be back together. She says sometimes you just say to most romantic things. Is there any hope? haha Thanks guys.",29May2017,3
9,"So, recently I have been thinking about life and all that jazz. One day when the thought of what I want my future to be a wrote this done. I have been wanting to share this but didn't know where because I dont know what this is, i thought maybe it was a poem but it doesn't feel like a poem. So here it is.

generally I want to be happy
 
I know so cheesy and cliche to say

I want to be around people who I love and people who love me back

 I want to be around people who I can laugh with till it hurts

I want to have a shoulder to cry on, I want to be a shoulder to cry on
 
I want to be healthy physically and mentally
 
being able to do cartwheels in my 60s would be pretty cool.

I want to be able to take comfort in the fact that when the world is being cruel and I just feel like giving it all up I 
have people, my people. The people who will stick with me and stick up for me.
 
I dont want to feel trapped

I want to feel free
 
I dont want to feel boring

I want to do things that give me joy, laughter and even a little fear
 
Because when I die I dont want to say ""Fuck, I should of done this or that"" I dont want to regret.

I feel I say what I want in so many words but yet this is such a simple request.



so, what do you guys think?

13,"I'm kind of only writing this for myself to get my thoughts down but I'm falling for this girl so damn hard, it's absolutely insane. Every single time we talk I'm left feeling that bit happier and content, and usually have a stupid smile on my face. Like when I'm talking to her I feel like I'm on the verge of laughing all the time; the slightest thing that's joked about sends us both giggling. It seems like we're always coming up with stupid inside jokes and shit and things just always seem so light and fun. It's like we're on the same wavelength on so many things; a lot of times I'll have a thought about something we're talking about, and maybe not say it for whatever reason, and she'll go on to say exactly the thing I was thinking. It's like we both just 'get' each other. I just have so much fun around her man. Probably more than I do even my closest friends. The most boring shit can just become amusing, the most mundane topic of conversation becomes interesting to talk about.

We both work together and are pretty well liked at our job I'd say, but it always feels like it's us and everyone else when I'm around her and we're talking. Like maybe I'm imagining it, but if we have a shift together then it seems like we'll find excuses to be around each other and will kind of cut other conversations short to talk to each other instead. We just sort of gravitate to each other whenever we can and everything else seems like an after thought. It's just so nice to have someone you can talk to that genuinely seems to care about you, you know? Like someone who would actually really give a shit if you weren't there. Most girls I like I feel shit cause they're some kind of unnatainable fantasy I've built up; I feel like I can't ever be good enough. But around her there's just none of that pressure. I feel like I am enough, just cause I know somewhere deep down she enjoys my company so much.

Like honestly if she's not in work or something I miss her so damn much. Just being around her makes my day so much easier. Every time I haven't saw her in a while I just hope I get to see her at some point soon. We used to work together all the time, but different schedules mean it's kinda rare now. Like once every couple of weeks. We talk in between over Snapchat but that's just not nearly as fun as face to face. Those odd times when we get to see each other are just fucking amazing and honestly I don't think I've ever looked forward to just seeing someone's face so much, or just talking to them. Even if I didn't have a thing for her, we're just really great friends.

I could tell her all this but then there's the whole clichéd 'I don't want to ruin our friendship' thing. Like there's been some signs she feels the same, like the whole making excuses to talk, and just a bunch of other stuff that's happened between us where things seem to get a little flirty or whatever. There's definitely a little sexual tension there, but I just don't want to ever make things awkward between us for any reason. I love having someone I can just be so free around and feel so content; I don't want to ruin that.

16,"Our standards for racial qualification in America are fucked. We largely consider those with a noticeable amount of African blood in their genes 'black' and we lump all of these people into one race. Why is this erroneous you may ask? Let's look at a few examples.

Our former President, Barack Obama, is half-black. However, in our country, we often times see light-skinned people who look far less African than even Obama does, yet they are considered fully black. Why is this? I know I'm going deep into semantics here, but it bugs me.

I am of African descent myself; I've never done a DNA test before but I'd love to have one to be able to directly find my ancestry. I have the privilege of not being an African American whose ancestry is virtually untraceable (due to slavery). I am the a first generation child of immigrants from Sierra Leone. So I can safely say that I am closer to being full-blooded black than a lot of other black people in America, save for other African immigrants and their children.

We all have varying levels of blood from other races in us; we're all related after all. Colonialism is a huge factor in spreading ethnicities throughout the world, creating new ethnicities like the Mulattos and Mestizos, etc. 

I personally can't provide a viable alternative to this problem of semantics I have addressed, as there are so many different mixes of people containing African blood, such as mulattos, people who perhaps have French blood in them, Creoles and Cajuns, etc. But I thought it was an interesting piece of information I'd wanted to share.

It ruined the whole day for me. I couldn't believe she would do that on a day I planned for weeks just for her and her friends.

So I'm 19 yrs old and I've never really had an actual gf I've had sex a few times with girls and stuff but thats it just sex nothing else. My life feels so limp like I don't feel like I'm advancing in life at all. All my friends have girlfriends and then there's me. I know I'm not ugly bc I get told I'm cute at least a few times a month. But I can't find a gf. I have a crush on this girl I know. We talk but not often. Last year I was supposed to take her on a date but never did for reasons unknown. Now we started talking a little again. Then she told me she was talking to a dude so I decided to stop snap chatting her. Then a few days after that I get a message from her asking me to go to a grad party so we can see each other and well I do go. But nothing came of that we really didn't even get to talk to each other. That same night she messages me again saying she wish I didn't leave the party and other stuff so it made me a lil happy bc she showed signs of interest. Btw at this point I was sure she wasn't talking to that dude she once told me she was. Anyways we talk a lil but more that night and she's asking me to go over keep in mind it's like 2am but we both decided that that wasn't a good idea so we call it a night. Next day I ask her if she wants to hang out after work and she says maybe. So whatever I'm at work and I text her at like 10 pm asking if she does want to hang and she tells me no bc she's sick. So I keep texting her and well I find out that she still talking to the dude so at this point I'm heartbroken. I thought there was some glimmer of hope for us but no. I'm so tired of this happening to me. 

I need a gf I'm tired of waiting. I honestly thought my life was looking up. I'm getting a promotion at my job so I'll be getting a $5 dollar raise so I'm really happy rn but this just happened so I'm back to being fake happy. Idk what to do I'm lonely tbh. I have my friends but it's not what I need rn. I'm not suicidal or anything just sad. Wish I had something special.

29,"1. it is okay to go to a shelter to get a cat and take it home immediately

2. you can ask the shelter for a specific breed and color of cat and receive up-to-date information about its AIDS status 

3. a girl bothers you, a cat does not

4. a cat draws people toward you, strangers stop by to pet it and to tell you how beautiful your cat is; a girl scares off other girls since you're taken and boys since you might beat them for looking at ur girl

5. when a cat you keep indoors likes you, that is called L-O-V-E or tolerance; when a girl you've kept similarly likes you, that is called Stockholm syndrome

42,"Hi. Thanks for taking the time to read this. I have an issue and I need help.

Two days ago I spent an hour trying to make myself puke after eating. I failed.
Today I successfully managed, finding a sort of sweet spot for my gag reflex. I've only managed some bile because I ate about thirty minutes ago. I'm sitting in the bathroom now, waiting for the food I ate to digest so I have something to puke up. EDIT: About 30 more minutes later I successfully puked.

The thing that troubles me about this is how calm I am right now. I know this is wrong, I know this is bad,  but I still don't mind doing it. But two days ago, I was in tears that I had considered and tried to puke. And here I am now, practically eager to puke.
I can see this becoming a habit, and I rationally know that is a bad idea. I've struggled with anorexia and exercise addiction before and I know how out of hand these things can get. So I was hoping to poll here for some help, considering my situation that I don't quite know what to do with.

I come from a mildly abusive family, I don't trust my mother or my father, and I don't trust my brother not to tell them (nor would I want to needlessly burden him). As a result I can't use their insurance (which I'm still under) to get a psychologist, or talk to anyone at home (or by extension, extended family.)
 I think I need professional help given my past, and how I thought I was able to manage this by talking myself through it each day, but apparently that's not effective any more. But I don't know where or how to get help.

I also have a boyfriend that I don't know if I should tell, at least right now. I just told him two weeks ago about my history with anorexia (that was never medically confirmed, but I wasn't eating more than 1400 calories a day while exercising 6 hours each day). I want to exercise open communication with him, because we both come from troubled homes and selves, but I don't know if telling him now would just make him needlessly worry. The same goes for my other 2 close friends- telling them this in its premature stage just seems attention-whorey.

 People dont understand how lucky they are to even find one person who's willing to stand their presence for more than an hour, and to have the gall to cheat on them with 5 other people only shows how fucking awful they are.

49,"I didn't do my homework when I moved cities for school, and I ended up in a *really* bad neighborhood so I could save on rent.  In that first year, I witnessed two shootings, heard a half dozen more.  There were open-air, broad-daylight drug markets being run out of a few of the nearby houses.  I had no street-smarts of any kind and would have walked right into a warzone without ever seeing it coming.

But this kid, neighborhood boy, maybe 14, saved my ass one day.  I was walking my dog, wearing earbuds, not paying much attention, when he rode up on a bike.  A lot of the dealers did that; they'd use kids as couriers to scout you out, see if you were a potential customer, so I didn't think anything of it.  I just kinda waved him off, like nah kid, I live here, I'm not a drug tourist.  

But he didn't leave, he rode up alongside me, eyes wide, waving to get my attention.  I pulled out my earbud, and he said, ""Don't go that way, man.  Not past the park, not today.""  He was all nerves.  He was eyeballing my dog--everybody in that neighborhood was afraid of dogs--so I thought maybe it was that, but he seemed too edgy.  He was looking over his shoulder, glancing back down the way I'd been heading, looking at the park, looking scared.

It was weird.  It got my attention.  I knew at that point the neighborhood was bad, but I didn't know HOW bad.  I just stood there staring at him, processing.  A handful of thoughts flashed through my head:  *Maybe this kid is in trouble...?  But why would he be warning* **me**? *Maybe this is some kind of trap; he's trying to get me to turn down the side-street where his buddies are gonna jump me.  No, that's too sinister--maybe it's more mundane.  Maybe he--*  A dozen alternatives, all processed in an instant, then his voice cut through my mental chatter.

*""Please.""*  He said it so emphatically, so *genuinely*, that I had to listen.  I turned completely around and started walking.  The kid rode off down a side street on his bike.

30 seconds later, I heard the gunfire.  I'm not Rain Man, but I guessed it was 30 shots--different guns, all overlapping.  Absolutely furious gunfire for 3 seconds, then silence.... then two more pops, then silence, then one more.  It was by far the most concentrated gunfire I've ever heard, and I was a regular at a 25-lane shooting range.

I learned in that instant that my survival instincts are zero.  I didn't dive into cover, I didn't break into a run.  I froze where I was, heart pounding, staring back down the street, wondering what the fuck just happened.  Sirens started to wail almost immediately... the police response time in that neighborhood was great; they had a lot of experience.

My dog was whining, trying to drag me back home so he could hide from the loud noises.  He got me moving, and we went home in a daze.  

All told, from the time he rode up until the time of the shooting, barely a minute passed.  But if I'd kept walking at the same speed, I would have been directly across from the park where it all went down.  Maybe just by chance I would have been fine, but maybe not.

After the fact, I'd learned that it was (unsurprisingly) a gang-related shooting.  I remember reading that 5 people had been hit, including 2 bystanders, but only one of them died.  I can't find the article about it, but I'm a little bit drunk and morose this Memorial Day so that's probably limiting my research skills.

And now my wife's stupid-ass cousin is bragging because he ""heard a gunfight"" when he ""was in Iraq"" (literally for two weeks as a civilian contractor for an engineering firm) and I want to shake his stupid ass and tell him that it's nothing to glorify, and people probably died, and no 14 year old should have to deal with that shit anywhere in the world.",29May2017,24
50,"Not much to say. My father was difficult, but I loved him. I'm only sorry that his last days were spent so alone and depressed. It's hard to get close to someone spiraling downward. I wish I had the mental strength to do it. It was quick. A heart attack. Getting up from his wheelchair and then.. nothing. Peaceful. Peace is all I've wanted for him for so long. I love you so much dad. I'm sorry i didn't call last night, but I'm glad we had that time together playing games. 30 min of bliss is the last memory I have of you. Thanks Dad. I'll see you around.

52,"It can be anything! Technology, health, psychology, whatever you can think of. Here's my example (which prompted me to think to ask this question in the first place):

Magnesium supplements have DRASTICALLY improved my quality of life. I'll keep it short, but I started taking Magnesium as recommended by a friend without knowing anything about it. I noticed an immediate significant reduction in my general anxiety level, which has been one of my biggest issues in life.

What other little-known facts do you know that can help someone in life?",29May2017,1
53,"I want to reserve a VIP table at this club in my town, and then afterwards go to this after hours club. I don't mind paying for the Uber between the two places, or even paying 100% for the table and bottle service. But I don't really have any friends that are into that sort of thing. Should I just go alone with the table to myself and invite people who are already there over to it? God, that feels so desperate.

54,"I'm 21 right now. My father is alchoholic. At age of 6 I was being beat with a belt, slippers or hand cassually when he would come home drunk. He would beat my mother also, the beating of her would stop when i would scream and cry out loud and be silenced. They divorced when i was 7. Since then i had no contact with him. Our financial state throught my teen years was poor. I would skip parties, going out and any other social activities which requires money. At school i felt no need to engage in small talk, it was meaningless to me. I was a target to bullying due to my silence behaviour as seen to others. I skipped classes, education was worthless to me, got in few fights, which led to problems with authorities at school. Then i  was close myself to start drinking at age of 14. Had depression. Due bad performance at school my mother said that i remind her of my father, this crushed me even more and i attemped stabbing myself with a knife to stomach but was stopped by her. From that day i felt no need to talk to her anymore. At age of 15 bullying continued but was slowing down. I started bodybuilding. By age of 19 i was tall, built. Bullying stopped completly, but the stigma stayed until graduation. Now i stopped working out, i don't care about my health, i haven't started studying anything yet due to not knowing what and lack of money. I've been in England by myself for 1year, worked hard physical jobs just to earn money. Now I'm back to Europe and i got drafted to millitary, the service starts in 2months and will take 9 months to finish. After that i will have atleast 2k euros to start something.
Today I feel motivated to change myself, I feel the need to speak out about what happened to me, I want new and different life, I want to experience things. But. I don't know where to start, what to do. The comfort within silence consumed me and my true personality which was shutdown by age of 6. So, if anyone had similar experiences, anyone who has information about recovery from this, please share it here i will value it. Have a good day. ",29May2017,9
55,I'm about to be 22 and I still can't drive. I have my license but I got it from being in a car with dual controls so the instructor could help if needed.

56,"They never molested or assaulted me sexually, but I'm starting to realize more and more how much their action fucked me up. So a little backstory, I come from a big religious family, both in numbers and scale of biblical devotion. We went to a Bible Belt church from when I was 7 to 12 that was so up tight the pastor ridiculed families for missing church to watch Super Bowl Sunday. When my parents gave me the talk around age 11, it consisted of them sitting outside with me In the most awkward silence ever, and basically told me nothing. aThat should give you a decent impression of some of my parents ways of thinking. 
Anywho, when I was 11 (I'm 23 now) and started getting funny feelings when I saw posters of Sports illustrated models and cheerleaders. After a while I figured it out and boom, the wanking has begun. For about a month I got away with it, but had no idea about browser history. My mom and dad called me to the computer room one night and I got a little nervous. Then my dad starts nearly yelling at me about using the computer to look at girls, I initially denied it (lol smart). He then proceeds to rattle off the search history; sexy bitches, girls in thongs etc. 
So I admit to it and they Immediately get so angry, start yelling about how horrible it is and how satan is trying to posses me, how I'm disturbed etc. They eventually made me pray with them for like 30 fucking minutes, then I had to write a 2 page essay on why porn and masturbation are wicked and evil, and How I should never do it. I was also grounded for 2 months, no computer or tv, and they also took away my xbox for 2 months which was my one real outlet to friends since I was home schooled. I think this led to me being an agnostic who despises their ideologies on religion and politics. Added with the pent up anger for what they made me do during puberty that completely went against nature has been something I can never let go of. I can't help but remember all the self loathing over the years that just won't go away, definitely contributed to my depression.
Eventually things got a little better and they lightened up a bit, still they're quite religious and strict. Any advice on how to get over this incident and move on would be much appreciated. ",29May2017,13
59,"On the one hand it is easier than ever to share knowledge that will make people's lives better.  

On the other hand, no one will pay me for it, and I'd really just be helping potential competitors in the market economy who have no impulse to share with me and who don't care about me at all.  

Also you can't really say anything without pissing someone off, including wealthy vested interests, so not only does it not help me to share, it sort of harms me.

No one has any idea of what they're missing, because how could they?

So other people are left not knowing what they don't know they don't know, and I'm left not sharing knowledge like an asshole because no one will pay me, or even give me credit for it, and they might use it against me.

62,"I'm 19 now and started playing guitar in October 15 on my 18th birthday (1 year and ~8 months). For quite a while I didn't think of it as a real hobby for me, since my 'hobby' was full time videogames basically and I played only chords at my scouting group. Now I'm starting to become a better guitar player, my rhythm/time keeping is still not that good and I don't know that much music theory really well. For just above 1 1/2 years it's good though I think.

I would love to play in a band somewhere though, but the people I met so far are studying and some don't even answer messages. I never really wrote a full song, just some lyric here or there that sounds like shit ten minutes later.

I don't know why I'm writing this.

63,"We've lost thousands of American service members in the recent wars. I haven't seen any posts on reddit front page showing remembrance for those we've lost, only posts attacking President Trump. 

Except for this fallen soldier, who's father used his death in 2004 to attack the Republican nominee for president, who didn't even support us going to war in Iraq. 

He served honorably, and gave the ultimate sacrifice. 

Khizr Khan sacrificed **nothing**, and is a piece of shit.

Just to name a few. I could go on, but you won't remember those names. They didn't matter to you before you read them, and they don't matter to you now. Fuck all of you who upvoted this thread. The only reason that particular fallen soldier matters to you is that his father politicized his death to attack Trump.

64,"Got booted from another sub for asking this so here goes, lol.

I'm 24. I have always been attracted to older men but never pulled the trigger on it. They are physically more attractive to me, I have better conversations with them, etc. I have my Master's, and am pretty advanced in my career already and find that it is difficult to find common ground with guys my age as they're still figuring things out (I know this is me and not them).


Recently, in the past couple months I started full on dating, mostly men between 45-55. I started noticing a pattern. Even though they all seemed very different on the surface - different physical appearance, career, history, personality, it was like they were speaking from the same script sometimes. Most of the time Dom/sub topics would come up, they'd ask if I was a submissive or open to being ""trained"". There were varying degrees of intensity towards these topics but it was a VERY common thread that early on in my interactions with these men they'd start feeling around to see how submissive I was.


To be honest, I've never had that type of relationship with anyone nor considered it until now but I AM in fact quite submissive, a pleaser in my personal life. It is in my personality. But it confuses me that so many of these older men can zero in on this.


So what I am trying to figure out is this: Am I subconsciously selecting for these type of guys? Am I somehow giving off a bat signal that screams ""submissive""? Can they sniff this out on me somehow? Or do men who seek out women half their age tend to want to ""exploit"" the age difference in this manner? Or is this how older men are with young women in general?


**TLDR** Started dating older men recently. 3/4 of them are interested in Dominant/submissive dynamics and I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing to attract this.",29May2017,2
