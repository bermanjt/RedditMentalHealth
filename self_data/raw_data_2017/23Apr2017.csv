He said he’d heard some of her affirmation and daily meditation stuff in a yoga class and he wanted more…well, we found one of those books, and then i also told him about how Melody Beattie writes about codependent relationships, and i handed him “Codependent No More”. 

He asked me if there was somewhere he could sit down and read through the books a bit before deciding whether or not to purchase them, so i pointed him to a table and some chairs in the middle of the store. I told him about our return policy and how he could bring it back sometime in the next thirty days. 

Fifteen minutes later, he comes up to my register to check out (both books in hand), and he’s clearly dazed, with a “deer in headlights” look on his face. I have to ask him three times if he wants a bag before he mumbles, “yeah, sure”. I remind him of our return policy, but he is clearly disinterested. He keeps staring at “Codependent No More”. 

I’m pretty sure this guy walked into the store expecting daily meditations, but he walked out realizing that he was in an abusive relationship. ",23Apr2017,456

3,"68 days. 

I have a long way to go. Hell, I'll probably be working on myself till I die, but at least it'll give me something to do. 

I've been on and off substances since I was 17 years old and never thought I had any sort of real issue, perhaps a drinking problem, but the only problem being that it was bad for my health. I, obviously, was entirely out of place with that thinking. It was ruining my life. And the lives of others as well.

The last straw was on February 13th of this year. Months of substance abuse that lead to acting on compulsions had entirely destroyed my relationship with my ex and her two kids, all of whom I was entirely in love with.

This has been the first time in my life I have taken the concept of personal happiness seriously. This has been the first time I have looked myself in the face and declared, ""This is enough."" I have lived entirely depressed since I can remember. I lived through a physically, sexually and mentally abusive childhood and throughout my life I kind of always accepted the idea that it didn't really affect me. Even though I've suffered mentally since I can remember, I assumed it was probably from simply having a defective brain. 

I have blamed a lot on my family for how my life has turned out in terms of finances and other matters, but I never blamed them and other parties involved on the mental issues. It's interesting how opposite that way of thinking really was. I do not hold a grudge against them. I am attempting to love even my worst enemy, to see people who do bad things as simply people who are like me - people who are unlucky with their brains, who made poor decisions on allowing thoughts to take control. 

Through the help of seeking professional advice, practicing mindfulness throughout these past 68 days, working out regularly, staying goal oriented, having a good diet, as well as some rigorous one-on-one time with myself understanding just exactly why I was even having the emotions that I decided to act on which ruined my relationship and friendships, I have been able to begin a real healing process. I've gotten to a point where I realize that I am a good man who's simply made some real shit decisions. But I'm not therefore a piece of shit; I'm not all of those horrid things I would tell myself day in and out. I was becoming a product of my thoughts. What I've come to be privy to is that the thoughts aren't me; I don't have to be them any more.

These past 68 days have shown me that what happened to me in my past might have caused my brain to have some cognitive defects, but I can do, and have been doing, something about that. I've finally been able to be honest with myself. Kicking the drugs and booze lifted the veil that blinded me from that reality. 

I can't say that I am a happier man, I'm in a world of hurt every day. But I am getting better, even if slowly. I pray to the god I don't believe in every day that the girls are doing well while at the same time I am trying my best to stay focused on that which I can control. It's an incredibly difficult task. I never dreamed of not being there once I was.

I genuinely cannot believe it took me so long to finally get to this point of revelation. I can't believe what I had to lose in order to get where I am going. But it is what it is and all I can do is just keep going in this direction, which is very obviously leading me to a healthier, happier life wherein I'll be able to trust myself. I would have never thought I'd have to lose family life and best friends to get my shit together. It pains me to know that I had to cause pain in order to get better. It pains me to know that is a fact of the history of my life so far. I'm one of those guys... but I am dedicated to being the true me, and never allowing that unfortunate fact to define anything about me now that it's said and done. 

It's all been difficult, but it's been an incredible little journey so far within my own mind. I am excited about the future, whatever it has in store. I am hopeful and grateful for the opportunity to be a happy and healthy person who can in turn be a positive force in other's lives as well. 

For anyone who's wondering, it's absolutely worth it to quit.",23Apr2017,11

12,"My story begins at home in upstate NY. Me and 4 friends decided to take a trip to the Adirondacks. We left without a solid plan as our first one had been ruined because the place we wanted to camp was closed, so we threw another plan together the night before we left. We picked everyone up and loaded up the truck and headed off anyway. 

As soon as the trip started we got into shenanigans. First we realized it was going to be a long trip and we decided to make the time pass by smoking a little weed. We made a pit stop at an abandoned school we had been to before to have a dope spot to smoke at. We took some bong rips and headed out again. Given the fact that we were very high, the munchies set in. We were already stocked up on snacks but we were passing a taco bell and there's no stopping a stoner who sees a taco bell. We got taco bell (and KFC as they were joined together), then set off again. We barely made it half an hour before our baja blasts reached our bladders and we had to stop for a bathroom, thus delaying our trip up even more. We kept trecking on, and decided to use the long way through the mountains instead of taking the highway, as it is more scenic. This delayed our trip yet again. Then while passing through the 'dacks our driver who is an avid fisherman spotted a stream that he wanted to fish in, so we stopped the car and grabbed our poles, and after about a half hour realized we weren't gonna catch anything and got back in the truck. We stopped once we got into the high peaks at our favorite Stewarts and grabbed some more snacks, firewood, and other various supplies. We reached our camping spot's trailhead and began to get ready to head up. We were camping at a pond about a half mile off the road, we thought a half mile wouldn't be any problem. It was a problem because it was very cold, very rainy, and very steep uphill, with streams running everywhere. We took two trips but eventually got everything to our lean to. (Thank god we had a lean to and didn't have to camp in the rain!) We settled in, got a fire started, ate some hot dogs and ramen, then smoked some blunts, some joints, and took some bong rips. We joked around for awhile and settled into bed. But that didn't last long as we soon spotted freaky lights appearing in the sky. They sometimes lit up large portions, and were sometimes thin columns, but there was no pattern to them. We knew for a fact that it was either world war 3 starting, or we were seeing a UFO land near us. We watched in amazement but then I had a stroke of genius and proclaimed that it was car headlights. (I'm not sure if it actually was but I'm 99% sure), so we got back in bed. Then another incident got everyone riled up again. One of our friends randomly said ""What's stopping us from driving to New York City tomorrow?"". Everyone FREAKED OUT, and came to the unanimous decision that we would in fact go to NYC when morning came. We were very cold, very wet, and our original plan of hiking some mountains was growing less desirable by the hour. If we weren't high as fuck we would probably realized, there was a good amount of stuff stopping us from driving to NYC. We made the pact that if we still felt it was a good idea in the morning that we would go. 

The morning came, and 4/20 had started. When I woke up two friends had already smoked bowls, and I smoked a joint without even leaving my sleeping bag. We somehow decided that going to NYC was still smart. We packed up our shit and somehow managed to make it down in one trip. 

So we hop in the truck, and make way for the city. We booked our hotel about half way there and were very excited. Then it started to sink in what we were about to do. We were all very low on money (All 18, all working the same pizza delivery/ dishwasher job), and the city is an expensive place. We did the math and decided that it would not be smart to go anymore. We called up the hotel and politely asked that our room be cancelled. No can do. We called back two more times asking politely. Still nothing. I called in one last time and would not leave them alone until our room was cancelled. Eventually we got a cancellation fee that was less than the original room cost by a whopping 20 dollars. We knew we couldn't just eat the cost of the room, and once again locked ourselves into making it to the city. We were sorta panicking, as we didn't really think about how much it would cost, and we didn't have any plans for what we would do there at all. The attitude of the car became very very negative. We kept repeating that we wished our room could be cancelled, or that we hadn't left the 'dacks, or that this was one of the worst days of our life. Once we got there though our attitudes improved slightly. We were here, so fuck it, we would have a good time with it. We left the truck at a parking garage, and took a train into grand central. We quickly became enveloped in the magic of the city and our attitudes improved. 

We walked for about an hour, mostly through central park, to our hotel room. We had some good talks and laughed about all the people ""observing"" the ""holiday"" in central park. We got to our room and my friend checked us in using his fake ID (weirdest use of a fake ID ever). Our room was pretty small but we all fit so it was OK. We got cleaned up and organized and decided to fill our appetites. We all got halal food (BLESS UP), and went back to our room to eat (It was literally across the street). We decided to just smoke a couple blunts in Central Park, head back to our room and call it a night. Thank fucking God we didn't end up doing that.

We started walking to the park, and since we were already in a ""fuck it"" kind of mood, we decided to ask some lucky stranger to smoke with us, it was 4/20 after all. My friend pointed to a random girl walking behind us and told me to ask. This was one of the best decisions of our life. I'm not convinced that this girl wasn't an angel. We will call her Emma for the sake of this story.

Me: ""You wanna smoke with us?""
Emma: ""Smoke what?""
Me: ""You know what day it is""
Emma: ""Well I get amnesia when I smoke weed but I'll walk with you guys""

We explained that we were 18 year olds in the city by ourselves. She decided she would give us a night we wouldn't forget. Now some background on ""Emma"". She is 21 and lives in the city, is very attractive, very outgoing, and knows the city like the back of her hand.

She tells us to follow her. We gladly do. She says that smoking in central park is boring and we should do it somewhere sketchier. We already thought the park was sketchy enough, but we trusted her. She explained that no one would give a fuck wherever we smoked so we smoked our blunts on a stoop right in the middle of the city. Then she said she would get us some alcohol as well. So we hop around some subways and she goes and gets us some Heineken's and she didn't even want us to pay. We go to Washington square and drink a little and have fun people watching. There was a dude arguing with some chick, a guy playing guitar and yelling nonsense at the top of his lungs, some frat kids doing something, and a guy reciting poetry behind us. It was weird but super fun. We get sorta drunk and were already high so we started dancing and singing random songs around the square using my portable speaker. It probably looked pretty stupid but we were having the time of our lives. We wanted a picture with Emma so we ask a random group of people if they could take our picture, they say yes, but then when the picture is being taken two of the guys decide they want to be in the pic, so we happily let them in, then the whole group gets in and we are even happier, then a random hobo appears who also wants in and we were ecstatic that we had assembled this group for a photo. It probably sounds stupid but we had so much fun interacting with everyone in the square. Then the cops come to close up the park and we part ways with all our buddies. 

Next on the agenda was finding a bathroom. We walk a little and Emma calls up her coke dealer (She had previously asked if anyone wanted to try it and me and a friend said we would). So we head home on the subway and get back to the hotel room. We chill out for a little, then decide to do the blow. We took the hotels mirror right off the wall for ultimate coke snorting coolness. Me and my friend do some lines and we all decide we want to smoke some more, so we roll some fat joints (one with a load of keef in it), and go out to smoke on another random stoop. Then we head back to the room one last time and unfortunately have to part ways with Emma. It was a very sad goodbye and we all agreed to meet up again some time. After everything was said and done it was almost 4 in the morning and we went to bed. 

The next morning it sunk in that last night was real and we hadn't dreamed it all. It was pretty uneventful after that, we just got back to the truck and headed home.

But that's the story of my reckless, roller coaster of a trip across New York State. Had to tell reddit since I can't tell anyone else I know.

TLDR: I went from camping in the Adirondacks to doing coke in NYC on the same day.",23Apr2017,0

No one else had seen the film, although they'd apparently read the synopsis. But it really seemed to be lost on them that the racial ideas were a key part of the film; like I'd just pull the race card out of nowhere for no reason with no context.

What was there before time?

What was there before god?

What was there before the moment of existence?

Where is it located and why?

There is the nothing answer that was always there and that nothing is infinity at the same time, so everything is it, we all come from the same source, which does make sense

I feel like i've picked it up as a belief system, i mean it's the closest thing to absolute truth of that which exists, but that's not it because what i'm trying to say, can't really be communicated in words, it's much larger than illusionary words and exclusionary thought that can place on it it's definition it's beyond the infinity of dimensional times and parallel words that ground it

Awareness Consciousness is just living proof of the god it are and it is nothing and infinite everywhere, as everything is divine there is no wrong or right just pure non-duality and much more then that, it's more than what meets the eye here on this simple multi verse

I feel like this might be a coping mechanism for me to deal with not being hurt with things that make us naturally insecure as human beings but I just dont know how to snap out of it. 


Lately, I started doing more things that involved taking risks with my emotions and putting myself out there but then ended up being disappointed and then feeling once again that maybe being an observer isnt such a bad thing. But at the same time it is so isolating and very depressing. I used to be comfortable like this but not anymore. I dont want to observe by myself.
