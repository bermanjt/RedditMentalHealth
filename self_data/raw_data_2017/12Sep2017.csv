0,"Almost every single night, the second I lay on my pillow, a rush of memories of last night's dreams come flooding back like I've flipped a switch.
My theory is that I've associated the feeling of my pillow with dreams, Pavlov style.

2,"So in my high school, we had to do a summer assignment. I didn't do it because I transferred over from another school. The teacher says I have to do it anyway and gives me two more weeks to do it. Since I'm a huge procrastinator, I kept putting it off to tomorrow. Last Friday was the due date and I never did it. I was in a panic when suddenly they changed the class schedule for everyone in my homeroom and as a result of that they changed my English class to another teacher. She never asked for any previous assignments from my old class. I feel so glad.

On the flip side, I lost my favorite teacher. Oh well...",12Sep2017,1
4,"Maybe Mr. Motel Owner's senses have been dulled down to nothing because Mr. Motel Owner is a smoker himself.  But us non-smokers who do not live around smokers can smell the stale stench of cigarette smoke a mile away.    
  
And that one moment we open the door, that first whiff of air...we can tell.  Immediately.  It unmistakable.  And at that moment, the thought going through our minds is, is it faint enough that we can tolerate it?  Or is it strong enough that we'll find somewhere else to stay.  
  
Please Motel Owners, if it's a former smoking room, just say so.  Up front.  No surprises.  Don't try to cover it up with sickly-sweet deodorizers or air fresheners.  Or fabric dryer sheets stuffed in the wall-unit air conditioner.  None of that works.  It just adds another layer of odor on top of the smoke odor.",12Sep2017,0

7,"I'm 21 and have a vivid imagination about my future. It used to always be about me becoming famous for saving the world from some kind of disaster which is a stark contrast from the title. These dreams and visions drive me to work on making them a reality. I want to do a PhD in CS and try to apply data science on climate data to improve forecasts. I also want to see how I can apply machine learning to geoengineering. 

Old me would fantasize about being on the Times Magazine cover for reversing climate change, but now I figure that as long as I know myself that I made a positive difference, I'll be happy and fulfilled. It comes from a lot of changes I've made with how much I care about what other people think of me. Someone told me their thoughts don't affect me but mine do. So the  most important person who's opinion matters is my own. If others don't want to recognize me, that's fine as long as I'm satisfied with what I did. ",12Sep2017,1

9,"I'm currently 35 weeks pregnant and I just had my baby shower 2 weekends ago. Some people that were not invited to the party started to harass me for not being invited to the baby shower. They keep sending messages like this one:

""We are so excited for you and pray blessings for your little one!! Would have loved to have come to your shower. Not sure what I did to offend you, but I'm sorry. I've always counted you as my friend.""


I feel they are more concerned about their own feelings being hurt than hurting me, a pregnant woman and supposedly ""their friend"".

Another person keep sending text messages asking how was the party and made a huge drama with my husband's family for not being invited. 

I feel I am on my right to not invite who I didn't want to hang out with. Why this people keep making drama? How to answer to their inappropriate and intrusive comments?

Isn't my right to have who I want to my party?

FYI: one person is an ex-coworker that was super bossy when we worked together and who I haven't seen for 2 years.

The other is a crazy live in girlfriend of my husband's brother that just like to complain and gossip. She is almost 50, with 5 kids and she never worked in her whole life. She likes drama and to fight for the smallest disagreement.

I don't know how to cut them off and reply to their whining for not being invited to the baby shower.

11,"This weird period seems like it's been stretched out for a few years now. I'm attending college, forced a position of a drama club president to myself so maybe I can finally get some recognition I think I deserve (but it's making me incredibly unhappy because I hate socializing with people and I'm irresponsible as hell.) My lover is visibly unhappy with themselves, me, and my poor decision making. I was fucked over by this person for reasons I believe that is entirely my fault. Now my self-esteem is crushed, crushed so hard that I wake up every morning with my heart pounding and feeling immense dread for the entire day. Putting myself down is the usual routine for me. I keep telling myself eventually I will find my worth, discover something I genuinely love doing so I wouldn't feel so shitty about myself. I just want to have stable income, creative skills, a growth mindset, confidence, and a car. I understand what I need to do, but even pushing myself to do those things I want is difficult. Why am I even giving myself excuses? Does it have to do with the fact I'm unhealthy in the inside?

I'm unhappy. I want to go back to 3 years ago, when I had some confidence left in me. Wish I knew the things I knew now. The love of my life doesn't love me the same anymore. I miss being their world. I didn't grow with them the way they wanted me to. I'm so far behind. How do I just let go of certain thoughts that stop me from wanting to accomplish the things I want? How can I just to give a fuck what others think of me and truly be myself?

13,"I still live here for now but in the next couple months I plan to get a job and move out. For the past couple of days my mom has just been telling me to get the fuck out. I went to a highschool football game on Friday and brought a friend home to stay a night. We smoked some weed (which is totally okay with her) and he stayed a couple days and left. It was our first paranoid high. Anyway, we accumulated some dishes and he left and I planned to do all my homework on Sunday (yesterday). Well the entire day, mom just started yelling. Like, just spewing random shit and some really horrible shit. At one point she said she wanted to cut my head off (WTF). Otherwise, she was just making up songs and singing really loudly. Or making up words and alternating them, like my grandmother used to do. At one point she was making chicken noises, loud enough that the neighbors could probably hear. When she yawns, she sounds like Tarzan(that's just more annoying than anything). I even started to question if maybe she was becoming senile (she's only 53 but it can still happen). Maybe she was drunk. Regardless, she wouldn't stop even when I asked her too. I could hear her over music, so I went out and confronted her about it. ""I'm trying to do homework, mom. Will you be quiet?"" All I was met with is ""Well you can just move the fuck out. I can do whatever the fuck I want."" And otherwise ""Get out"" and ""Get the fuck out"" and ""move"". So, I went back to my room and locked myself in. 

Today, she came to the house for a minute, and yelled at me, calling me a lazy piece of shit who doesn't do anything for her. That I'll never be able to do anything for myself or go anywhere in life. She said she doesn't want anything to do with me. That was the line that broke me. I've had this kind of thing happen before, but she never told me anything like that. I never felt welcome or even happy with her, not for a long time. Mom was the person that I could go to to talk about anything. But the past two years she's become so chronically stressed and emotionally unstable that she has episodes of mania. I get it, mental illness sucks. But she never takes back what she says in those states. She won't acknowledge what she said or did was wrong. She did the same thing with my sister. She told her that she better sleep with one eye open, along with a whole other situation related to that and similar to my situation. She didn't talk to her for two years.

I can't just let this pass because it will only happen again and I can't take that.

Honestly, I've never felt so heartbroken in my life. I just had the woman who I have spent my entire life with, literally, just want me out like I'm just a lazy bum. Just tell me she wants nothing to do with me, like everything just didn't matter. She doesn't see me as a son, she sees me as a leech. I won't be moving out on good terms with her. I'm still in high school trying to graduate with honors. I'm trying to pass with flying fucking colors and kick ass all over again in college and get a degree. So if I seem like a leech, mom, it's because I'm writing a 2500 word essay for a $5000 scholarship. I'm eating your food and using your internet so I can be academically successful and successful in life. But now school is the least of my worries. I could be homeless any day if I can't get a job and apartment first.

14,"Deep down, I love who I am and when I was younger, I never thought twice about expressing my personality through my clothing, music tastes, catchphrases, etc. Unfortunately, it's been years since I've felt comfortable being genuinely... me.

I know I shouldn't care about what people think, but I do too much. I want to dye my hair bubblegum pink, deck myself out with gaudy jewelry and wear neon clothing while driving around town, blasting dubstep or psychedelic rock shamelessly like I used to, because I deeply love all of these things. I can't do it anymore without feeling immense shame.

I'm afraid everyone thinks I'm just doing it for attention. I go through phases where I try being my authentic, extroverted self, but that's short lived. I keep reverting back to this new timid and self conscious persona that's been plaguing me for the past few years. I end up convincing myself that my true self is a horrible, abrasive person and that no one likes me.

What can I do to stop this?",12Sep2017,3
15,"A few weeks ago I wrote a post here asking /r/self for advice on how to lie about being sexually experienced to avoid social derision. Later, I wrote another post about how my anti-depressants are killing my sex drive and turning me asexual. In hindsight, the former was probably a bad plan - people will know that I'm lying and will likely mock me for it. I'd like to expand upon my thoughts in a more constructive way and hope I will get some good insight. 

I am 22 years old, but I find it likely (though far from certain) that I will die a virgin. Most people would scoff at this, but aside from losing interest in sex, I doubt I will ever trust another human being enough to be in a serious relationship, let alone engage in sexual intimacy. I have major trust and self-esteem issues due to events that happened to me both as a child and as an adult. I struggle with severe depression, to the point where I have been in a psychiatric facility and regularly see a therapist. On top of all this, I have Asperger's Syndrome, so I am clumsy in social situations, selfish with my personal time, and extremely introverted.

In short, I'm a fucked up basket case of a human being that will likely only ever have the companionship of a dog. I'm not as bothered by it as others would, and am definitively **not** looking for advice on how to overcome this - I am at peace with a solitary life, and am planning my future with only myself and my dog in mind.

I don't fear loneliness. I do, however, fear humiliation. I have an interesting paradox that defines my personality: I don't really care if my hobbies or interests aren't socially acceptable, but I avoid sharing things about myself with other people because I hate being laughed at, or judged, or hurt in any way. Some people may tell me to stop being a wimp and toughen up, but that sort of thing just dives me deeper into depression and makes me want to kill myself. I'm fragile, basically.

Society inherently ties my worth and value as a man with how many women I've slept with. ""Only a few"" may be acceptable, but the older I get, the more judgment I will receive for never having gotten laid at all. I feel I will always have to avoid the topic with future co-workers or friends - and that if any find out, I will be outed and humiliated by anyone who knows me. I will be ""KBAREY, that loser 30-40-50 year old virgin.""

What I'm trying to say is that I'm OK with never experiencing sex or romance, but I'm NOT ok with anybody knowing that (because, if I'm being honest with myself, I don't really fully trust anybody).

What can I do about this? How can I avoid being humiliated? My idea has been simply to avoid making friends altogether and live life as a hermit, but I don't necessarily want that - ideally, I'd like to have a small circle of friends whom I hang out with on occasion, but without anybody knowing anything too personal about me. But sex is one of the most frequently discussed topics, and people are proud of their sexual prowess. I dread the question ""What about you, what was your first time like?"" I'm terrified of people knowing how utterly non-functional I am in something that is so important to so many.",12Sep2017,4
16,"As of late, I feel more and more self-loathing. 
From putting my passions aside and instead opting to indulge in the occasional alcohol and smoking up to neglecting my health. Focusing less on work and my partner and instead wasting time with my friends who bum on a daily basis... 

And as of late, reality slapped me harder in the face with a back condition due to the lack of exercise and daily bad posture, it's all hitting me at one go and I blame nobody else but me for all of this. 

I wish I could turn back time, un-do certain things and make better decisions instead but obviously that's no possible. I clearly know what needs to be done, the changes I have to make, the whole reorganizing and re-prioritizing of my life but that wave and sinking feeling of regret is hitting me and hitting me hard. 

On top of all that, I've come to the realization that certain ""friendships"" I have kept, aren't worth keeping at all judging from how I am always the one who takes the initiative to plan outings, meet up or simply make the calls or drop a text message to check on people. If it's always one-sided, then what is the point?

18,"/r/truerateme 

A few years ago I used to go on /r/rateme occasionally. It was a pretty normal sub, other than the fact that it was pretty much made for attention seekers. Never really cared for it other than for looking at pictures of pretty girls (since those were the only ones that were upvoted).

I was curious (like viewing Flat Earth videos just for the hell of it) and wanted to see what was on this other sub, and Jesus Christ it is sad. From what I've seen it's just people being overly judgmental (giving a **maximum** of 6.5/10 unless incredibly beautiful). The people are comprised of /r/incels and just kind of plain assholes.

If you're 5'10"" or shorter, you're considered subhuman manlet filth (not exaggerating the words here). If you're not white, you lose out on some points (there were literally people saying minus points for someone being Indian, or ""curry"").

I understand the purpose of a sub that's called /r/truerateme. Some people might beat around the bush, which a lot of people might not want. That's perfectly understandable, and I'm sure there's a decent amount of necessary honesty. But these people fall under the type of people who say ""I'm brutally honest,"" i.e. ""I say things for the sake of being an asshole.""

22,"Hi guys, after almost my whole life feeling like this, today I decided to share this feeling with reddit.

I'm 19, I'm an introvert and I was born and live in Italy. My blood origins are half southern Italian and half eastern European (doesn't really matter where). During my childhood there were a few years in which my parents couldn't spend much time with me and I basically grew up watching American TV series and surfing the Internet. I also became much indipendent and I think not having any brothers or sisters even furthered the thing, as well as not having real bonds with relatives. I was always made fun of in elementary and middle school, I felt and feel very different from most people (regardless of country). Luckily, through the years I've been able to make friends with some awesome guys and they all come from different cultural backgrounds. Anyways, I've been working a lot on self-improvement in the recent years, and I shared this little background story with you because I think it helps to understand why I feel out of place where I live.

When I was 12 I realized a lot of the things I like and some ways of thinking are American or can be associated with America. I then grew this kinda infinite passion towards the US and have been wishing since that I would one day move to New York City (for many reasons such as being progressive, a cultural and technological hub, etc...). I want to point out that I'm aware of the downsides of the US, but I'm also aware of the positive sides and believe they win against the negative ones. I visited New York for the first time a few months ago and felt well in that environment even if I didn't know completely how to behave in some daily circumstances (trivial things that you usually don't know if you didn't live in the place for some time before).
I really dislike Italy and the general culture of the people here, which feels very negative, lacking ambition and initiative, with a lot of people trying to be leeches of the system and profiting on the backs of ""weaker"" (or just more honest) people.
At the moment I don't feel like belonging to a specific country (maybe I'm a third culture kid in some way), but I feel mostly attached to the US.

46,"TL;DR: a bad, useless and worthless friendship from the past is making me think about it constantly. 

I'm a 17yo dude. When I was 14 (2014), I was in my old school. Looking back, I was such a little prick, fucking annoying, for fucks sake I was so kickable-in-the-face (at the moment I didnt think I was so annoying, though). In 2015, I moved to my current school, and my life changed - but not because I wanted so. I was too embarassed to talk to people, so I was kind of 'compelled' not to be annoying. So, I made one. Single. Friend (lets call him V). He was just like me: a weirdo, didnt talk to anyone, didnt have conversation subjects. Nothing against him, but he wasnt the friendship I wanted to have.  
Fast-forward to the end of 2015, I was still the exact same person as I was in February.
In 2016, a new year started: I was determined to change myself: I made 4 other friends (true friends, the other people I didnt really talk to them). 3 of them are girls who are, today, my best friends (B, L and J1). The other one (J2) was a typical redditor, which is very important, because he kind of waked me the fuck up to life, by introducing me to Reddit (surprisingly, Reddit made me way less anti-social).  
Yet, I continued to talk to V in the lunch, because I judged myself not able to talk to other people (namely, B, L and J1), as I didnt have enough things to talk about (complete bs).  
Fast-forward to February 2017, I was determined to change myself. Yet, I still talked to V for about 1 or 2 months, until I actually got to hang out with those 3 friends. I felt much better and more confident. I had actual friends, I was happy. V is now alone, not because he's being isolated by other, but by himself, and he seems to be as happy as he was when he talked to someone.

I am, now, a completely different person. If you take me and my 14yo me, there's only a slight physical resemblance. That's all. I'm ashamed of my past. I still get haunted by the thought that, during those 3 years, I could've been so much better, I could now be someone so much more confident, but I dumped it all to stick to a worthless friendship.

47,"Quick version:

Baby sister, 25, worked full time, sang karaoke every weekend, dozens of adoring friends, drank socially and smoked pot, opinionated, fierce, resilient. 

Started drinking heavier and heavier, daily. Racked up 3 DUIs in 4 months and lost her car. Lost her job but found a waitressing position. 

Started taking Adderoll to keep up at work, admitted to becoming addicted. Progressed to meth, *eventually* admitted to being addicted. Quit meth and Adderoll cold turkey after a particularly bad acid trip. Claimed a guy ""saved her life"" and bought with him a puppy, a kitten, and a few apartment decorations for his roach-infested ""bachelor pad.""

A week later, got engaged to him with plans to marry ""secretly"" in a few days. Got broken up with *instead* after she allegedly turned the location off on her phone. (I was there, her phone died, we couldn't find the charger for a few hours, it fell inside the couch.)

She's now back together with him, claiming ""he's my whole world."" It's been 3 weeks since the acid trip. Maybe. 

She isn't the type of girl to hear, ""You're making a huge mistake,"" and hear out anyone's reasons. Not even my voice (as close as we are) will help the situation. 

It's to the point where I don't even *want* to talk to her because it's only likely to cause a rift between us. And I hate not talking to her. But she's spiraling emotionally and it's been impossible to predict how she'll react to *anything* these past few months alone.
