This is the bag that was stolen along with many other things. She has had that bag many years and its been heartbreaking watching her look for this bag online and see no results. It was purchased at an FYE store in Illinois. I wonder if I can try contacting corporate and maybe they have an extra? I'm wanting to be her hero and find it but I haven't. What would be another subreddit I can post this in? I'm wanting all the help I can get locating another bag, don't care if used and super old, I need it. Any ideas on what more I can do ?",06Mar2017,40

8,"We were cuddling up. My arms around her, my face buried in her thighs. I could smell her scent. I was dreaming, but I could still smell it. I haven't seen her in years, but that scent seems to be stored securely in my brain. It is intoxicating. It awakens something deep inside me and turns me primal. Like an animal. A scent that I used to crave like a drug.

9,"Like, imagine a being named Dave, Dave is a normal guy like me and he was created by a god named Gave, so Dave got created by Gave, who created Gave? Well he was created by his god, so GGave  creates Gave who creates Dave. GGGave then therefore creates GGave who creates Gave who creates Dave and so on so forth. 

Well we get into a problem of infinite recursion, gods creating gods and weve already been warned about stairs bro. So in the interest of time we will work with something like 

Dave &lt;- Gave &lt;- MetaGGave (the almangation of the recursion)

given that this is all text and none of it is actually real, theoretically I came up with MetaGGave as a way to solve the problem of infinite recurison, which proves the existance of MetaGGave, which then proves the existance of Gave and Dave subsequently. The existance of Dave then reinforces the existance of MetaGGave through his own faith, thus the nature of god is self sustaining. 

God is a nested system of meta-textual elements. Like House of Leaves or Homestuck but applied to our universe. ",06Mar2017,1
10,"I was bored out of my skull Friday night. I have nobody in my life I can call on in those situations to rescue me from myself. Naturally I ended up at the pub at the end of the road. Figured I might as well get fucked up at worst and fucked up and laid at best. I'm a loner and sometimes I forget how entertaining people can be. In short, I had a good time. I chatted with this musician and a couple older ladies who were using me as a buffer between themselves and this young(looking like a 16 year old with a fake ID) horny dude. 

I like to think I am very smart. It's a huge part of my ego. Since I was a child people would tell me how smart I am. I never developed myself. My social skills, my intellectual tools, physical skills, all of it went out the window. I ended up as a condescending, alcoholic tool with some qualities of Brian Griffin and Bojack Horseman with no real skills. I liked to argue because I had to tell people ""I am very smart"". 

I've been struggling with depression and other mental illness since my early twenties. I feel a lot of that is because I've been drugging and drinking so I wouldn't have to face my inadequacies sober. I didn't have anything going on then and I don't have much now. It's taken me a decade to learn this little bit about myself to get to the point where I can take action.

Probably would have taken less time if I had seen a therapist. I never opened up in group or therapy because I was convinced that it was the world that was out to get me. That I was special and people were threatened by my intelligence. The truth is people don't like an asshole. That's what I was and it's amazing I had anybody who would spend time with me. As I got older those people stood by me less and less. I wasn't worth their time anymore. I don't blame them. 

Moving forward has been difficult. Thankfully I didn't completely destroy my brain and body, I escaped having a criminal record by the grace of god and I have a father who got me started in a skilled trade. It all came down to taking my meds, staying sober and working hard. If I put my success down to anything it would be working hard and improving my skills. I'm not the kind of guy who's funny, charming and witty. I'm not ""one-of-the-guys"". Thanks to the decisions I've made I'm a fucking weirdo who can be extremely self-conscious and withdrawn. I'm working on that. 

Getting back to the story I started with. Me from ten years ago couldn't have gone out alone and struck up a conversation with a stranger. Hell, me from last year couldn't have done that. I've been trying to reach out to people and appreciate the company I'm in. It's taking a hell of an effort to reign in my ego sometimes. I can't fully escape that person. I can't outrun my demons forever. I try to keep them within checks and balances. I do my best to develop myself and better understand what this world has to offer. I try to make myself more than what I was meant to be. 

So, yeah. When I tell people don't kill yourself I'm someone who knows because I've stood at the edge and gazed into the abyss more times than I'd like to count. Painful experience is necessary for personal growth. I'm preaching, I'm on a soapbox and after all the shit I've been through I think I've earned the right. Don't kill yourself. Give yourself time to figure it out. Work with a therapist, trust your support network and for fucks sake sober up. If that's the one thing I've learned it's don't kill yourself. There is way more life to live than you may be able to see at the moment.  

If you've been through some shit and would like to share your story I'd encourage it. Our pain and sorrows are not as unique as we'd sometimes believe. 

EDIT: My relationship with alcohol is less complicated than this makes it seem. I don't drink during the week or if I have plans on the weekend. It's a poison. When I was drinking daily I was poisoning myself. My brain was chemically imbalanced, my body was sick and everything in my life suffered. I don't identify as an ""alcoholic"", I'd say problem drinker. Remove the drinking and remove the problem. I've been successful with moderation. If you can't do that then you're probably an alcoholic. ",06Mar2017,37
11,"Hello everyone, I'm Bullseye. I'm a High School senior, and I am going on a sleep fast for science in order to measure how lack of sleep affects the performance of the brain and body.

It's basically a given that many people do *not* get enough sleep during their lives, and I want to show how that can affect the body by measuring performance at ten-hour benchmarks in my fast.

So, what do you think could be the best way to do that? I've already thought of doing some simple logic and problem-solving tests online, as well as going to the gym and measuring how much I can max a lift at. I will also be keeping a journal to record my mood and feelings during this time.

13,"I'm a 19 year old woman and I'm just realizing that all through my teens years and now I've been desperately seeking out middle aged men to fill the role of my father.  

My actual father is still alive.  He isn't absuive.  He is just never here.  He's gone on business trips and school 75% of the time.  He was gone growing up too.  I also couldn't express any emotions or feelings in front of him because he's a very stern, judgmental man.  I had a ton of emotional issues growing up and was always told ""act normal"" and ""that's crazy. Don't do that.""  My mom was extremely abusive.  

So I've realized for years I've been desperately trying to seek a surrogate father in the form of literally any middle aged man I encounter in my life.  I did it to both of my high school music teachers.  I felt this sense of love to my cello teacher and sometimes wanted to tell him he was like another father to me.  I would hug him and my school music teacher as well.  

When I was 16 I met a man online who was in his forties and began an affair with him that lasted until I was eighteen.  Then, he left me and refused to speak to me anymore.  That was in 2016.  That ruined me emotionally.  I was so screwed up after that and felt like I was unworthy of love.

I still am doing this I've noticed with a professor I have who is a man my fathers age approximately.  This professor calls me pet names and makes little jokes about me and gave me a lecture about growing up.  The other day I become sexually arroused when he made a joke about me.  I sometimes google him or have fantasies about him like hugging me.

14,"Husband and I are remodeling a kitchen in a house we bought and found two very obvious fake $1 bills. One of them was printed so badly the edges don't line up and one was printed much better but the color is wrong and it feels like that expensive stationary paper but definitely not like money. I have no intent to use them of course but they are kind of funny. We talked about hanging them on the fridge as a joke but realized this might create a legal issue as having fake cash is, as I recently learned from my legal expert, Mr. Google, a felony punishable by prison time. So now I imagine I will have some long talks with law enforcement in my immediate future. Maybe I will get lucky and they will help me tear out the rest of the kitchen looking for more fakes.

19,"More often than I'd like, I find myself in social situations(mainly in groups) where everybody around me is significantly better and quicker to respond and make comments, so I am stuck saying very little, if not nothing. Especially in situations where I would not know what I'm talking about(for example; sports or a music artist I am unfamiliar with), I don't know what to say. My mind is blank, and I kinda just look at the person talking, or stare off into the distance. In addition, every Friday night for a group that I'm in, we all stay at somebody's house for the night, and I'm really noticably not social, because I'll not say anything for around 3-5 hours, most simply because I can't think of anything to say.

When I am with family, or close friends however, I seem to be able to socialize much better. I can much more easily contribute to conversation, and keep the conversation going.

Although, if I am talking to one other person(or the girl I like(if I can even muster the courage to talk to her)), conversation is very mundane and worthless, and I can't make good smalltalk. It goes like:
Her: ""Hey, how's your day?""

Me: ""Pretty good! How about you?""

Her: ""I'm doin good myself""

Me: ""[nothing]""

Her: ""lol heck off u suck at socializing you'll never get ur dick wet"" (joke)

It's just really awkward and I have trouble getting closer to anybody else if I can't talk to them. With the girl I like, I'm almost 100% sure that we are both horrible with social stuff, so that kinda makes me feel better.

Regardless, I don't wanna be so socially awkward anymore.

21,"Shit happens sometimes that make me start to think there is something out there fucking with me.

It started out with me on my day off. Getting a nice meal and watching a film I have REALLY REALLY been wanting to see. 

Something I was really looking forward to. Most weekends are just getting a meal and watching a new episode of a favorite tv show, but a film I have been REALLY wanting to see comes along only a few times a year. And tonight was my night.

I wanted it to be great, something to really enjoy, but no.... fate has to shove its big veiny cock up my ass to try and stop me. Or so it seems that way. 

My evening starts off with me going to pick up something to eat I have not had in a long time that I suddenly wanted to get. A meatball sandwich (and garlic bread). So... a half hour before closing I go to Goodcents (a sub shop I frequent). I get there and while ordering I'm told they already shut off the oven so... I couldnt get my meatball sub. Little annoyed. Ok, there's subway down the street. I stop there, start to order and am told that they are out of meatballs. Lovely! Very annoyed now. 

So I consider just cancelling everything and just having a regular night off and putting my special night off until next weekend. But something was just bothering me and I defiantly wanted my fucking meatball sandwich and my special night off with that film I have REALLY been wanting to see. 

So.... ok, I decide to go to Fazoli's (a generic italian fast food like restaurant  chain) to get one of their meatball subs. I had never had one. So I go there, order one (and some garlic breadsticks) , drive home, undress and get into my comfortable lounging clothes. Get the movie playing then open the container to the sub sandwich... and notice something odd. Meatballs are there, mozzarella is there, pepperoni is there (I didnt know it came with pepperoni so that was a nice surprise), all inside the bread sandwich. BUT.... there was no marinara sauce. NONE! ..... **MOTHERFUCKER!!!!** You've got to be fucking kidding me! WTF! Is this a cosmic JOKE? Am I being fucked with by some entity trying to make me lose my mind? 

So... I stand there for a second... deciding what to do. Eat it as it is? But it isnt what I wanted. It would ruin my perfect night. So I called up fazoli's and asked if it was supposed to have marinara sauce on it (assuming it was). They said yes and I told them I didnt get it, and was told to come back and get a new one.  Ugh! Ok. 

I just throw on my shirt, hat, socks and shoes. I broke a lace by the way. On my GOOD boot. One that I could still tie. The other boot I broke the lace months ago and just left it that way. Anyways I leave with only my keys and phone. In my lounging-around-the-house hole-ridden sweatpants (its dark out ... no one would see me. I drive half way to fazoli's and realize I dont have my wallet with my ID and I dont have my dashcam hooked up (I brought it in earlier after getting home as I wanted to get some footage off it). 

Now... the pessimist in me is wondering if this is fate fucking with me again. Will I get stopped by a cop (when I dont have my driver's license? Will I get into an accident (and not have my dashcam)? 

Thankfully nothing else bad happened. I got my food and got home safe. The fates didnt set me up for the bigger fuck you (it seems), but the night isnt over yet.

38,"Alright reddit, I got a lot to try and say and I'm pretty bad at this kind of shit so hold the fuck on. I'm asking for some advice, maybe even just some different ways to view different situations that are going on between my girlfriend and I. So a little background. Been together about two years. Already have a 9 month old boy (not planned but hey, that's life) which I'm sure the whole having a baby thing probably plays into this mess in some way or another. But anyway. Our relationship started off like any typical relationship. Super lovey, bangin' all the time, just great.  Now for example, it's been going on 3 months since we've boinked. Shit is just not the way it was before. And I'm going to give you a run down of some issues and what not that I'm having a rough time figuring out. 

So religion... Started off our relationship never really getting into the topic much. I was baptized catholic. Grew up in Sunday school, going to church all the time, and I HATED IT. Not really sure why. But even at a young age I never really got it. Always questioned things too much and didn't fit in with the rest of the crowd. My girlfriend, she's Christian. Her parents are Christian nazis. For example, we have a kid together and still are not allowed to sleep in the same room. I get told by my possible (hopefully) future in laws all the time that my relationship with the lord is the most important thing in life. More important than kids, family, any of that. Which i think is fucking insane. Anyway, my girlfriend is pretty into the church stuff. Never talked much about it to me though, made me go to church, or any of that shit. But as time goes on, she's beginning to be more and more like her parents. She's wants nothing to do with me, gets super pissed if I don't go to church, tells me she just can't believe that I'm not a believer. I don't know why I'm not. I honestly would like to fit in with her and go to church and not look at everyone there like they're nuts and it's a bunch of bullshit. But that's just how my mind works. I'd fix it if I could.

44,"I started dating this girl back in November and I guess our relationship started back in January. I really liked this girl. She was funny, weird, and quirky. We had a lot of similar interests and we were going to do some hiking and exploring in the warmer months coming up. 

That is until yesterday when she broke up with me over text message. Here's what happened.

So one of the things that irked me was that she would constantly lose/misplace her phone. There are worse things and nobody's perfect I know I'm far from that as well. I tend to be a bit impatient with people who don't respond back to my texts after an hour or so, but sometimes I wouldn't get a response back from her until a day later. I was learning to be more patient with her because I really liked this girl.

Anyway I tried messaging her on Facebook as that was the only other social media presence she had but to no avail. I managed to get a hold of her once that week very briefly. I learned that she had lost her phone and that was all I knew. There were some things I wanted to ask her about the weekend and what plans she had so I could make my own. On top of that, I couldn't help but feel a bit worried (for whatever reason). 

Not knowing what else to do about the situation, I decided to go to her place and wait for her to get home from work. I was there from 6:30 till 8. She never showed up. While I waited, I wrote up a note which I left stuck in her door. Looking back on that, the note may have sounded a bit too forward. I hinted that I was a bit upset she didn't make a bigger effort to get in touch with me. As I'm waiting, I finally receive a text message from her saying she found her phone. At this point, I admitted that I had been waiting at her place and that I left her a note. I decided to leave the note wedged in the door in the hopes she would find it humorous and laugh at my expense. 

Apparently I found out it had the opposite effect. It actually made her very uncomfortable and now she no longer wishes to see me. 

I'm a very humble person. I know when I've screwed up. I've screwed up many times in the past and I can accept my faults. I had no idea this would upset her as much as it did. I thought she seemed like the kind of person who would laugh this kind of thing off, but I guess I was wrong. 

What's shitty about this is that she told me this over text and she won't give me any chance to explain myself. She's allowed to hide behind a wall of text while I'm left to feel guilty and miserable that I upset her so much. Oh, and that I'm a total creep to her and her friends now as well. However, it did feel a bit sudden  because we had already been very intimate at this point. I figured this would be water under the bridge. 

In her message, she claimed that this was a lot more serious for me and I deserve someone that can be 100% invested and that she's not in that place right now. This sounds like the kind of stuff I would've wanted to talk to her about as I'm not wanting marriage, kids or anything right now, I just wanted a best friend. Talking about what kind of a relationship we'd want from each other was going to happen eventually, but now I'll never get the chance. 

There is a lot of hindsight here that I wish I had more of last week. I'm sure most of this is my fault and the situation I created was not my intention at all. I was coming from a good place in my heart, and I genuinely didn't know how else to get a hold of her. I wish I was just a little more patient.

I've almost no confidence and am constantly looking for validation. I can't even talk to people properly. I'm depressed all the time and am always having negative thoughts. I don't have friends because having friends requires being a capable human being which I'm a complete failure at. Have never had a relationship in my life because who'd ever want to date a sad sack loser like me. I wouldn't. I'm pathetic in every sense of the word. And that is why I hate myself.,06Mar2017,19
58,"A pale blue dot on my phone, notifying me of a new message in a messaging app I use. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it's from one person.

That's all it takes for me to break into a small smile and for my heart to skip just a tiny bit in joy - for that person to send me a message and for us to talk.

That pale blue dot will appear and blink throughout the day as we send each other messages. Day after day, that pale blue dot flashes - and I still have the same reaction.

No matter what it is we talk about, it always brings me joy that you find my company worth the time. That you enjoy talking to me. 

I feel the same way. It's something I haven't felt in years, and I'm just happy to have you as a friend. Thank you for being my friend. It means the world to me.",06Mar2017,4
59,"I'm a visitor with no control of where I'm going, and I don't seem to be able to activate my once active mind anymore. I see trains taking off, great things in their infancy going on to become something revolutionary, and I'm so insignificant there's nothing I can do to be a part of anything. I'm so desperate to be a part of history, but maybe I just sit back and watch it happen.

I've been plugged into a hyperreal TV show that I've been watching for too long. The tape is starting to repeat, and nothing seems new anymore. I constantly ingest entertainment, but everything tastes the same now. I'm tired. Perhaps I aimed too high, maybe that's why I fell so flat.",06Mar2017,2

63,"There is a point in everyone’s life, the first big thing that happens, you know, that really flips your world upside down. For some it comes later, and for others, it comes sooner. For me, it came very recently. 

Simply put, I thought I fell in love. To me, he was almost magical. He was so knowledgeable, so clever, and he gave me the intellectual conversations that I had always craved to have, but somehow never found. I loved him, I really did. 

However, with love, comes blindness. You want to see the best in that person, in the parts that you adore, in the things that make them flawless to you, and you brush aside the little red flags going off. There were many sirens that I should have paid attention to, but I didn’t. Spending time with him, felt euphoric, it felt like a rush of adrenaline and dopamine, like I beat my old high score, like I finished first in a race but most of all, like I was worth it. He made me feel worth it. 

I didn’t realize that I never needed someone to give me my worth. I was valuable all on my own, and he took that away from me. 

We began our relationship not on tenets of appreciation, compassion, and understanding, but rather on civil displeasure, infatuation, and anger. He was seemingly always angry at me and he was unafraid of voicing his displeasure. He criticized what I did, why I did those things, who I did those things with. He blamed me for my choices, and even blamed me for his. In his eyes, I was always in the wrong. In his eyes, I was always the villain. But, “I loved him”, i told myself. This was okay, I told myself. “This was love”, I thought, and despite its destruction “it would be worth it” I thought. It would be okay. 

A few weeks into our volatile relationship, he told me he had stage II lung cancer. It was spreading fast, and he was seeking treatment as soon as he could. My heart ached for him. He was hurting, and by extension, I was too. By extension, I felt sick too. He told me he didn’t tell his parents, didn’t tell his friends and he swore me to secrecy. He told me if I told anyone of his sickness, I didn’t love him, that I didn’t care for him and that I was lying all this time about how I felt towards him. 

This became a repetitive theme. Him claiming I didn’t love him, that I didn’t want him, that he would never be enough for me. It sounds ridiculous now, but when you’re so infatuated with someone, you don’t want to hear them say things like that. You are giving them everything you have inside of you, squeezing out every last drop of love you have out for them, all because you want them to feel loved. You want them to be happy. You want the best for them. And so I gave, and I gave, as he asked for more and for more.

He told me he finally got treatment, and he was okay now. I was overjoyed. The fear of losing him, of losing someone so close to me, someone so special, someone I had put on a pedestal out of fear and love, was okay. He was okay. 

A month passed, and things apparently got worse. He told me he was now constantly in and out of hospital for multiple surgeries. Operations on his heart, on his kidneys, his liver; he told me he was very sick and he was unhappy. He told me he was afraid of dying and I told him that together we would brace these tribulations together, because I loved him and he loved me. I told him I would do whatever he needed me to do for him. 

I thought that was what you were supposed to do. 

However, as time went on, the quality of our relationship rapidly diminished. I still loved him, but I felt different. I felt lost and I felt alone. I sometimes felt annoyed, and disgusted and completely and absolutely exhausted and I couldn’t figure out why. I eventually just assumed that it was because he was so unhappy, I was now working at being happy not only for myself, , but for him too. I was willing to, though. I thought I always had so much love and happiness inside, what’s a little more? 

Well, a little more didn’t just come from thin air. The extra love I poured into him, was drawn from my other relationships, like the ones with my closest friends. I pushed them away in hopes of pleasing him, of making more time for him, and I began to even give him the love I kept just for me. The love that kept me sane and me. But I still gave it to him, out of desperation and out of hope that it’d make him happy, finally.

My efforts were futile, for the fighting escalated. We fought night and day, over text, over the phone, and it was painful. They were angry, hate fueled words he threw at me. They were comments that insulted, criticized, blamed and words that no one who ever claimed they loved you, should ever dare say to you. His words began to take a toll on not only my self confidence, but me, as a person. He told me he loved me, that he was hopelessly in love with me, but he would then turn so quickly, and call me cruel names. I was “neglectful” when I needed to spend time with other people, I was “ignoring him” when I didn’t reply in seconds, and I was “lying” when I was too exhausted to call him. He said I was manipulative, cold and heartless. To him, I was flawed in every way possible, and to him, I was the one that was not good enough. 

The more we fought, the more I heard these claims, the more I began to adopt his mindset. I began to wonder, “am I really that worthless?”, “am i really not good enough?”. Thought after thought spiraled into fear and deep rooted resentment. I grew restless, anxious and cynical. My jokes were darker, my laugh was faker, and my smile turned dimmer. I thought no one had noticed this change, for even I was not aware of it. Until one day, someone asked me why I looked like a shell of me. Why I looked so broken. And why I looked so gone. 

Something snapped then. Something clicked that something was desperately wrong, and I needed to end it. I needed to stop it. Loving someone like this wasn’t right. Love shouldn’t make you feel like killing yourself, love should make you want to live. 

After a lot of thinking, I broke up with him. I just had to. And subsequently, he threatened to take his own life. He threatened to not attend anymore surgeries in hopes of a timely death, he threw threats of drowning himself, of hanging himself, of harming his own body in attempt to reclaim mine. I felt terrible because no, I was not heartless, nor was I cruel. I was a living, breathing, human who loved, and seeing him in so much pain made me not only hurt for him, but hurt for us and for everything that happened. He phoned me constantly for the next few days, pleading, crying, begging and then eventually yelling, screaming and most often, belittling. He made me feel not only inferior, but worse and evil and terrible for doing what I needed to do for myself. Reason, logical thinking, facts, even feelings, had no effect on him. He was displeased with my decision, and was bent on making it known.

However, I realized I had reached a breaking point when on the phone with him for the very last time. I found myself become so overwhelmed with emotion, to a point near hysteria that I couldn’t think. I couldn’t see. I couldn’t feel. I couldn’t feel the sharp edges of his words any longer. I couldn’t feel that I was breaking whatever it was in my hands in half. I could no longer feel the hurt that fueled this intensity and destruction. I was reduced to nothing but blind anger and complete frustration.  With every plea of his undying love for me, with every threat of his suicide, with every word he spoke that simply drove a knife into my gut, I lost it. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I had actually been smashing my phone against my desk, and with such force that I shattered not only the screen but the rest of the phone as well. I was in a state of panic and it was here that I finally, finally, broke down. Realizing what I had just done, I was hit with a wave of exhaustion, fear and frustration that had finally reached its climax as I realized it wasn’t just my self image or my self confidence that was on the line, (that was already all gone). It was my sanity that was being threatened and I could not and would not take it anymore. 

The next day, I went to see my school counselor. To this day, I don't know what I would have done without her. She spoke with me, she understood me, and she gave me the words I didn’t have to explain what had happened. It was manipulative, his tactics. They were meant to guilt trip me, they were meant to make you pity him and they were meant to make you want to care for him. It was abusive, I learned. It wasn’t love. It was brokenness seeking some form of dependency, some kind of security that no human could offer without breaking themselves apart to fill the holes in him. I eventually learned, that all of our stress, our suffering, our supposed love, was fake. He had lied about the cancer, he had lied about the surgeries, and that he was a perfectly physically healthy boy. Everything that I had hurt for, everything that he had held against me and over me in hopes of guilting me to do his bidding, were all lies. He was a lie. For six months, I had existed in a sick, twisted lie. For six months, I felt like I had hurt and broken for nothing. 


Recently, I’ve been recovering. But it wasn’t until I began to understood what had happened. As you could imagine, the aftermath of this left me feeling, confused, empty and at first, more shocked than hurt. I learned that what had happened, all his tactics, our broken relationship, already had a name; abuse. It was emotional abuse and it was wrong. It wasn’t right, It wasn’t love. It was abuse. And it didn’t come from sickness, nor his empty threats. It came from a broken boy wanting a love that didn’t exist, from a girl that didn’t exist. He was in love with the shallowest idea of me, perpetuated from his own insecurities more so than the real, living breathing me that had stood before him. He tore down my self esteem, my self image, my self confidence, and he stripped me from the things that made me, me. 

But somehow, i found the cure to my ailment. I threw myself into the things I cared about again, my poetry, robotics, debate and reading - these were all things that made me feel worth an ounce of something. Not because they were achievements, nor because they were significant, but rather because I was doing it for me. My poems were for me. My robots were for me. I chose to do them, and they were of my own accord. I was broken, but in that carnage came an opportunity. I found the opportunity to grow, to learn and to understand the world a little bit better. The world was no longer as bright and shiny as it used to be, but the world gained a little bit more colour this time around. My life had definitely been tinged by darker hues now, but it is the shadows that now bring more depth to the colours that had originally been there.My life is just as vivid, but now with more perspective. I am growing again. There are admittedly bouts of times when I feel the pangs of self doubt and I question if his words ring true, but still. I'm moving forwards. I'm looking up, and I'm going to do better. 

TLDR; the world is beautiful and hope still exists. Dear redditor, you are a survivor for already existing and making it through the day. Have faith in yourself, for you are deserving. you are always deserving. ",06Mar2017,1
