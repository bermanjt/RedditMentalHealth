2,"More frequently, I've been getting the overwhelming feeling about how artificial everything is. We watch the news, we read the papers, we repeat what's said. And that's it. 

No one speaks with passion, urgency is absent. The world is too busy, constantly pining for our attention, constantly presenting us with distraction. We live everyday in subconscious denial of our being part of the problems we discuss so disdainfully. We read off a script that satisfies our good intentions, and then lead a life contrary to those same ambitions. No one believes in what they say anymore.

Poverty? Animal cruelty? Climate change? Suicide rates? Terrorism? Pollution? Consumerism? Who cares? 

When asked, we all readily agree that they are a  horrible series of events; and then ask what one shall have for tea this evening. No one cares for anything outside of their field of view, no one moves a finger more than they have to. 

Everyone views everything as us and them - their problem not ours, something they're responsible for not us, something someone else has to deal with, not us.

And caught up in this world of indifference and inaction towards something meaningful; it hurts.",23Dec2017,6
3,"I was at home with my 7-year old son, when a friend called me up and said ""go out into your backyard and look up at the sky, right now!""

So I go out and look up, and I felt a knot in the pit of my stomach, what looked like a comet but moving at the speed of a satellite.  ''What the hell is that?  Oh my god, is a large meteor about to crash?""  A very deep feeling of uncertainty that surely comes from instinct, this has been the cause of many disasters throughout Earth's history and we can feel it in our bones.

Then I remembered that rockets on circumpolar orbit launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base, between Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo in California, and I felt much calmer, but still excitedly I run off inside and Google ""Vandenberg + rocket + december + 2017"", and sure enough, there it was, and it wasn't just a regular ol' rocket, no sir, it was none other than a SpaceX Falcon 9.  I did a little fist pump, as thanks to my friend, I got lucky enough to quickly witness a little bit of history.",23Dec2017,2

7,"So you complain on social media and when people show concern and tell you to go to the doctor or offer to drive you to urgent care, suddenly you don't want them to know and push them away. You don't go to the doctor and avoid taking care of yourself because you're depressed and having people care makes it seem worse.

I'm an asshole who probably had a concussion and will one day probably die from needing a doctor and procrastinating going and not telling anyone anything is wrong.

We're definetly good friends but I don't know if we might become something more. She visited my house yesterday and we played board games and (unfortunately) watched the Star Wars holiday special. Afterwords we walked around my neighborhood for a good two hours looking at Christmas lights and talked on my porch swing for another two. I'm pretty sure I have feelings for her, but I don't want to move past ""friends"" territory at all if she doesn't want to. Not really asking for advice, just sharing the story of a fun night and my feelings about it. Wether we end up being friends or more than friends, life is good right now :)",23Dec2017,3

26,"My perspective after having read a ""new"" book called the untethered soul: The Journey beyond yourself recently…
It has come to a simple question for life when you learn that suffering is a lie. It is in fact typically chosen due to a moment of fear or fear. If you were to always choose love, you would never be suffering.
Someone broke up with you and you are sad, but, if you literally chose to be happy you would be. 
If this doesn’t make sense, then reading the untethered soul would be your first start.
Almost every part of life that you will learn that is good is coming from an essence of faith.
Relationships thrive on faith. You will thrive on faith in yourself, once you realize what that is.


How does a 24-year-old whom has been so lost in their head their entire life when I just want to live I first wonder how to reach that which has been detailed in these books. I can see the perspectives in front of me as options. But, for some reason I will not walk through the door of truly letting go.
I would say that the habitual nature I have is still very much clinging to my past.
I procrastinate so much currently I feel that I’m just not on the right path, that my passion isn’t truly being brought forth.
I don’t know how to change this. But, what I do know is that I am in a unique position of awareness that I just want to understand, and I do know that directly I can choose to just have faith and not required understanding. But, I want both.


I want the faith and constructs of living in the now, and yet the capacity of thought to truly explore life vividly and alive and maybe even analytically.


Now, I just don't know how to make it in this current torn state.
How does someone remain fully mindful and also think deeply and analytically without it pulling you away from the center so often described?


As I often perceive the life of the now, it is acceptance. So, while you can perceive practical change I don't understand how you would well be encouraged for it?


What do you see behind these words? Who sits in the chair?

27,"Okay I almost always have felt tense and irritated and slightly angry when family or neighbors talks to me. My brain reacts this way. Sometimes I feel a tiny bit better, not much.

I am sorta sick with depression and rarely leave the house, live with parents. Whenever I have to go out in public alone, or like a supermarket, or say old friends invite me out, or family member is coming over to meet and greet with their new spouse, or dad is bringing by a new friend and I have to go talk to them, whatever, I get these HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, God-awful tense dread anxious racy feelings, I CANNOT control or shut off, they are so bad I just feel horrible want to commit suicide it's so bad the feelings are SO BAD - and when I do ""face my fears"" and go be there, in so exhausted and tense during the whole situation I resent it and haven't made progress in 5 years forcing myself around others like this, and OMG get this; unless I run away or hide or give myself an escape route (i.e. getting in my car driving up the street and hiding in my back seat 20min before the people arrive), and take the exit of the situation, Then I feel AHHHHH this incredible feeling of relief washes over me and I can relax and be happy again.

I've tried 4 medications. I've seen 5 therapists. I've forced myself in public situations. Literally NOTHING is working. I can't even walk out my front door and be seen by my neighbors. I often feel so lonely, and crave intimacy, but when I get those opportunities the above happens.

So my question to any fellow human beings out there, wtfdid? Am I destined, is it my cross, my fate, to literally just be forever alone? I don't know what else I do, I've seemed all modern treatment, my life is so sad. I've considered ending it. The agony, am I right?

tl;dr: I have extreme, extreme God-awful SO BAD horrible dread vulnerable feelings can't control social anxiety, I've tried a multitude of modern treatments from pills to therapy. Nothing has changed in 5 years or more. I live with my parents and am too scared to leave the house. I've tried forcing myself, nothing helps like at all. Will I never be in an intimate relationship, or will everyone just take advantage of me? Do I just accept and be forever alone? Wtf else do I do in life if suicide isn't an option?

Normally I've had a mindset of yeah whatever do drugs who cares, just be safe. Now shit. He was on the upswing. Now I won't be able to have silly arguments with him. Tell him he's stupid. Tell him I'm proud of him for starting to get his life together. 

 I told him he needed to quit his bullshit a few months ago. We'd gotten into a lot of bad arguments while he was using. I just feel like crap. RIP in peace man. You'll be missed. The world is worse off without your bad ideas and the fun you could bring to the table.",23Dec2017,279

31,"I'm 18 and I basically haven't had any parents the last 6 years, I do whatever the fuck I want really. Which is to sit on my ass all day. I am unemployed, retaking the school year, and the only thing I really do, or did, was lift weights, which I was passionate about for around a year and then my acne just got to the point where I couldn't bare to look at myself and so taking progress pictures just became depressing more than inspiring, and my eating habits reflected this with a massive rebound from 8%bf ripped to around 18% lazy bum. So now I don't really do anything. And there's nothing stopping me from sinking deeper and deeper..



I listen to my friends complain about their dad forrrrrcing them to do driving lessons.. their mum forrrrcing them out of bed in the morning... their dad shouuuuuting at them to do their homework... how they can't get their parents off their back... How mad they were at parent's evening.. how, 'omg I've got to go to guitar practice' or 'omg my dad is making me choose one of these jobs he's got for me'. I'd fucking love this parental pressure. I'd fucking love it. So on a monday morning when I cba waking up, there's something, someone, stopping me from just staying off. So when I do bad in school, I get a kick up the ass and get yelled at to do my homework, instead of my parents not even knowing I'm retaking the school year until a few months after. So when I just want to stay inside fuck around on the internet all day, I've got nagging parents that motivate me to make a life for myself so I don't have to live with them.

34,"	A natural hazard is not a role that I like, but have played that in my life. At times the offense was conscious and at others it was unplanned. Stomping on spiders is an activity that places one in the role of a hazard to nature. One of my university biology teachers once stated that during ones life you would not be more that 6 feet from a spider so get used to the idea and thank the spider for controlling the insect population inhabiting your space. Never the less I still stomp an occasional spider and at the same time marvel at the countless webs across a field on a foggy morning as the sunlight reflects the rainbow of webs covered with dew.
	Rodents tend to raise my natural hazard index to 10 and I have as a result accumulated considerable guilt with the numbers of these mammals that I have sent to their deaths. These include the voles and mice that attack my vegetable garden. At times there is collateral damage as a result of my natural hazard tendencies such as the sparrow I found in a rodent trap yesterday.
	Rodents after all are doing just what they do best which is BREED in large numbers unless they are checked by a natural hazard such as a coyote, bobcat, or house cat. At times I have substituted for the natural hazard when the natural predator was absent. The horned owl that I hear at night appears to be overtaxed as the local natural hazard to the neighborhood rodents, so I have filled the gap.
	Rabbits are an entirely different category of hazard since they elicit a warm feeling generated by the warm fuzzy stuffed bunnies of my childhood and the enjoyment of the Bugs Bunny antics. These images are a far cry from the ravaged flower beds, denuded patches of ground, and the Bok Choi nibbled to the root in my garden. I am afraid to confess that I became a major natural hazard in this case. The natural hazard took the form of a box of 100 Long Rifle 22 caliber 29 grain bullets. Needless to say the green leafy vegetables are growing again and the flowers are blooming. I should also mention that I occasionally have a PTS event over the July 2017 massacre of bunnies.
	I have also participated in a well planned and anticipated mass slaughter in the early 1970 when our family was experimenting with our return to nature phase upon moving to Orcas Island. The event started with an order of 50 chicks to raise for eggs and meat. This growth stage went relatively well with the exception of the raccoon attacks every night withstanding the use of the 22 caliber 29 grain solution. By the time it came time for me to play my role as natural hazard the flock had been reduced to about 25 chickens ready for the pot.
	At the time we were living at the end of a quiet lane visited by an occasional weekend visitor, so I decided to set up the killing ground on our back patio. It turned out that did not give sufficient consideration to the location in full view of the lane in front of our house. We set up the camp stove with large kettle for dipping the dead birds to loosen their feathers; the chopping block to remove their heads; and a table to clean and package the birds for the freezer.
	The scene was what one might expect of a natural hazard playing out in all of its horror. Chickens running through the grass spurting blood with their heads removed; family members dipping dead birds in a steaming cauldron of water; others stripping the feathers from steaming birds; and others were gutting birds for the freezer.
	Between lopping off chicken heads I noticed a young boy about 10 standing in the lane in front of our house observing the mayhem.  He stood transfixed for a while and then began walking slowly wide eyed toward out back patio with a look of consternation on his face. He came to within about 6 feet of my chopping of heads and stood paused for a while. He finally asked…. “What are you doing!?”. 
	The teacher in me said I should explain this in a sensitive manner so that he understood the human food chain so that the fried chicken he was eating in the suburbs was not a foreign object. At the end of my lesson he stood there for a moment or two absorbing my words and the scene of carnage before him and finally relied slowly and wide eyed …..“No you’re not!”.
	World population has reached a point where my mere existence has made me a natural hazard. Driving a car, using plastic, excess consumption, watering the lawn, cutting trees and forests, and the list continues to grow daily. The accumulative consequences are beginning to show their unpleasant, damaging and sometimes horrific effects such as global warming, extinction of animals, and armed conflict over land and resources. 
	As a personal natural hazard I have to ask will I be in the “What are you doing” mind set of seeking a solution or will I be in the mind set of “No you’re not”.

36,"North Korea is an actual country with actual people. It's probably terrible there, but there's also a lot of politically-motivated disinformation being spread about this country lately (especially on far-right websites/4chan). An invasion of North Korea would likely result in a nuclear war, the deaths of *everyone* living there, and countless other deaths in the Pacific region. Please take a moment to read a book about North Korea, and you will see that a lot of these conspiracy sites are spreading outright lies (perhaps even propaganda) for an American invasion of North Korea.

39,"Every single Christmas. EVERY YEAR. My family self destructs. Everyone is constantly expecting me to make time for them this holiday. No matter who I choose to spend my time with, I have 5 other people pissed off at me for not spending time with them instead. I go to dinner with my girlfriend's family? Now my family is mad at me. Go to dinner with my family? Now my girlfriend and her family are mad at me. Also: how can my family expect to make plans for me, not tell me about them, and then get angry when I already have plans?

Why do they have to get in screaming matches over nothing? Constantly. My mother is dying of end stage renal failure and yet still her and my sister are at each other's throats constantly. They get so pissed off over the littlest thing I don't even know why we get gifts for each other anymore it always ends terribly. No matter what I do, I'm always somehow the bad guy even though I'm constantly going out of my way to do these things because they make others happy. God knows they don't make me happy.

December and January are the worst months of the year. I hate them. Always have. I hope all of you have an especially great holiday this year. Do it for me, please, as I will not have a good time myself. I know this is probably a dumb thing to complain about, I'm sure there are plenty of people who just want a warm home and a nice meal for Christmas but God I just can't wait til it's spring again.

40,"Not a single soul that knows me, knows that I self harm. I can't keep this to myself any longer, even if I am just telling some internet strangers.

In the last week of December 2016 I started self harming. Scratches with scissors at first, all on my thigh. I stopped for a couple of months and instead switched to digging my nails into my arm, sometimes until I just about broke the skin. A few months later I started cutting myself again. Since then it's gradually got worse; I've switched from scissors to a pencil sharpener blade, and constantly want something sharper. I used to think it was something I was in control of a could stop at any time, but I can not get the urge out of my head. Although my cuts aren't bad or deep, I constantly want to do more damage. It's almost like I can't stand seeing my skin bare. 

I finally told my GP in November that I was having very bad mood swings and anxiety and she put me on anti-depressants, although I didn't tell her about the self harm. The anti-depressants have numbed me a bit and just made me indifferent to everything, which part of me likes. But in the past week I feel like the medication is having no effect. I'm irritable again, I get a little paranoid, and have a low mood often. It feels like I'm back to how I was before. The negative, dark thoughts have returned. I'm so alone.

41,"As I write this, I am watching a letsplay of *Getting Over It With Bennet Foddy*. I thought about *why* it was fun to watch, and *why* people played it in the first place.  
Obviously, it's fun to watch for all the same reasons people watch other letsplays, but also for another reason. Schadenfreude. Schadenfreude is the enjoyment of watching people fail. We all feel it. That's why we all watch rage-game letsplays.  
People play it for two main reasons, as I see it. Youtubers, streamers, or other online players do it partially or fully for views, but that doesn't explain why people play it in private, non-recorded or non-streamed. Because these people are either masochists, or literally insane. There is *no* other explanation I could find.  
It isn't for challenge, because unlike games like cuphead, it never *feels* like your fault when you fall. Despite the controls being consistent, they *feel* inconsistent because they are difficult, and clunky, and complicated.

And I don't get it. I don't get *why* people find that failure enjoyable, and maybe *they* don't know.
