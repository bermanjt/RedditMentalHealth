3,"I didn't know this, but apparently, Amazon is trying to utilize in-house shipping instead of USPS, UPS, and FedEx. So, sometimes, when you order a product on their website, you'll received tracking through 'AMZL_US', which is their own shipping.

Well, recently, I've ordered two products and it used this shipping service. Each fucking time, the package got lost because the shipping guy 'handed it directly to a resident'. I live in a locked apartment building where packages are supposed to be given to an office located right in the front -- handing a package to a resident means the shipper literally handed it to someone who happens to just be standing around in the front of the building.

Worse, the tracking didn't list the name of the resident who received it meaning the delivery guy didn't even bother to get the name of who he handed the package to.

Anyway, Amazon is obviously still testing this service as it is new so I understand there'd be kinks, but I'm still not any less pissed off.

They also obviously have a price limit where they test this service. The two orders I lost were small (under $30). However, I also recently ordered a larger item from them ($200) and they used FedEx who, of course, does it perfectly. Figures.",15Aug2017,2

I try to eat at a caloric surplus. I just need a way to work out naturally, so I can build them. Like i said, sailors have sailor hands from sailing, so what should I do?

I don't have a damn clue where my life is headed. 

But if I were to die tonight. I can take solace in the fact that I've been nothing kind to everyone I speak to. That I make them feel good about being themselves. That I'm always cheerful, happy go lucky, and I wear my heart on my sleeve. They'd speak of how difficult it is to catch me without a shit-eating grin.

19,"Tried posting this on /r/AskMen, but the automoderator kept removing it. So, I figured I'd post it here:

I'm 22 years old, and I've never had a girlfriend and never had sex. For a variety of personal reasons (mostly related to my mental health issues) I am unlikely to be capable of either for the foreseeable future - possibly for the rest of my life. I have accepted and come to peace with this, and I'm not looking for pity or reassurance.

Rather, I need to know how to address this in social situations. As I get older, my virginity and inexperience will become more and more stigmatized, and revealing either will likely cause me to be subject to ridicule. So, my question is twofold:

A. At what age should I start lying and begin claiming to have had sex and been in relationships, and

B. What's a convincing way to lie about this? Should I claim I had sex in college, but haven't since then? What about the girlfriend issue?

Basically, I need to know how to bullshit people on the subjects of dating/sex in order to avoid being found out and humiliated. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: I am not looking for advice on how to get laid or become more confident. **I am incapable of being in a relationship, and need advice on how to cope with this in social situations, not advice on how to overcome this.**",15Aug2017,8
20,"Long story short, I met this girl 6 weeks ago through a mutual friend and we ended up hanging out for a few a hours on the next weekend before we went to an event at some restaurant. Anyways, before we parted ways that evening, she gave me her email as her phone had died and I didn't have my number on me. So we messaged and plans were in the works to hang out again, but she stopped replying. (I also gave her my phone number too)

...

I sent an email inviting to go on a boat ride a week later.

Nothing.

Wtf? Did I get ghosted? Did she die? I seemed to think our night ended amicably. 

Fast foward to last week, I was adding minutes to my phone and was looking through old texts. Fuck. Me. She texted me 4 weeks ago, but I didn't see it because a) all of the spam texts and b) my text notifications weren't on.


_-_-_-_-_-__-_-_-_-_-__-_-_-_-_-__-_-_-_-_-__-_-_-_-_-__-_-_-_-_-__-_-_-_-_-__-_-_-_-_-__-_-_-_-_-__-_-_-_-_-__-_-_-_-_-_

Anyways, I explained the situation and things haven't skipped a beat. We hung out again last Sunday for about 5 hours and it was wonderful. We went on a bike ride, a boat ride, and then ate at a restaurant. Man, things went well. We made each other laugh, had nice discussions about stuff, and enjoyed the day.

We made plans to hang out the weekend after next, as we will both be out of town next weekend.

Anyways, I just want to share my thoughts and feelings.

This is my first legit friendship in my adult life where we hang out at regular intervals (I'm in my early 20s). Really it's my first legit friendship where I've hung out with another person outside of school/extra curricular activities.

I'm so damn happy. She's super smart and she has a nice sense of humor. She's cheerful and kind and thoughtful. She's German as well and I'm coincidentally learning German because I intend to study there soon.

Hopefully this friendship lasts. I think I'm average in looks, and perhaps I'm a bit clumsy; more so socially. But she's interested in me as a person and she's always so detailed with her farewells like I'm important as a friend. I'm not saying that I've felt neglected in the past here or that it matters, but it makes me feel special.

I AM SO HAPPY!!! Things are going so well at the moment. I can't wait until we meet again in a couple weeks.

If there is a benevolent god, I pray that our friendship will last forever.

28,"I feel the same, but at the same time I'm excited. Initially I wasn't, but I suppose it was a delayed reaction. I always figured my entire life that I wouldn't be smoking or drinking, because my mom never wanted me to and I wanted to be above those that did.

Fast forward so many years later and I've been smoking marijuana and drinking various liquors for the past couple of months, albeit only socially, but here I am. I enjoy myself when I do these things. Moderation keeps it interesting. I may not love where I'm at when sober, but I like life. I've moved on from so much and conquered a lot, that I feel like a winner, so to speak. And when I'm with friend smoking and drinking, it just feels a little bit better. No inhibitions.

29,"i keep having dreams about her. i don't want her back. the familiarity of the sunlight running through dishwater chestnut hair. the familiarity of her speech--no-- her laugh. i promised myself i wouldn't write about her anymore but that night we fled through a park of portables and ate the cakes meant for the guests of the high class trailer park party. 


sometimes i bear down on myself to keep from floating into impossible reveries: only in dreams am i understood. someone safeguards me as i am delusional, verbose, panicky, afraid. someone commiserates and when they nod, it is not pity nor distance. it is acknowledgement. 

my fathers stomach twists itself into a knot and i stay awake with paper thick walls to shield me from his errant coughing. acid licks at the mouth of his gullet. we are both awake. it is rumored on forum and board that slippery elm will coat his throat, it will do the trick. i order some and it will come in 3 days. the man has not slept for 10 years, i ask my catholic friends to pray for us all.


i summoned all my courage this night to peep my affections to my loved one. i must be patient and kind because he is to me when i do not deserve patience or kindness. he is busy. i understand. i wish to keep my heart under wraps again. in parchment paper tied up with string and then folded into a duvet. 
--i do not know what balance is. i think it is keeping my mouth shut though id like to scream like a banshee until the moon's ear itself is red from blood.


i think about mortality. in the life of a fruit i am hardly near ripening, i am still hard and green. i think about how these days are so quickly eaten and yet how i only come closer to rotting. i cannot see myself flourishing to earn a delicate rosy blush and a sensible taste. i am being eaten by bugs, becoming bitter and calloused, awful. my mental illnesses put me on the borderlines and i have a putrid smell because no one will eat me. a different metaphor: i am a blackhole with indulgent impossible needs and i am empty from now until forever.

33," He is old and has cancer. His breathing is eratic.  I barely know him but he asked me to stay the last time he was conscious so I stayed. Held his hand for a long time but now I have to sleep. I don't know if he'll be alive when I wake up.  I don't want to sleep while he dies. But I do have to sleep. Both his death and my sleep are inevitable. Part of me was hoping his transition would happen before mine because he seems so far gone. but his roommate just told me he was even worse last night and this morning he woke up lucid.  I just told his hand with another man who came to visit. This other man  was friendly. He said the dying guy brought them off the street several times as a kid, told him don't do drugs. Fed him, let him crash at his apartment,  let him shower there. This guy told me they're used to be a big bird cage in the apartment with a cockatiel who didn't like anybody but his owner. 
 I asked him, the dying man, do you remember your bird, hon? Sweetie, are you in pain? Are you in pain, honey? I had to ask over again the way you would ask a two-year-old  to keep their attention.  He whispered yes.  I gave him his first morphine. Liquid. Then I made him drink water but he started coughing. 

I told him he would feel better soon. Any minute. We could tell when it kicked in, he became more relaxed.

 He relaxed only a little though. I wanted to give him another dose but it was too soon and by the time the right time came around he was  asleep again. And now I have to fall asleep.",15Aug2017,1

38,"Me and dad were so close. He believed I wasn't a retard when I couldn't talk as a child; I had PTSD and Selective Mutism. He always was the understanding one, having had severe Depression all his life himself, also dealing with my mum's BPD. Divorced my drunk pillhead mum but he'd known her for so long he could only ever empathise and say ""she cares, just in a really fucked up way."" and let her live with us on and off because ""every girl needs a mother, we all need to help each other out, and despite her flaws she has a good heart."" Honestly I wouldn't know what to do with her nor me in such a situation; I became a drunk pillhead self-medicating bitch a few years ago myself when years and years of therapy and pills failed me.

I thought the government should stay out of people's lives - stop telling everyone what to do. So someone wants to smoke weed? It doesn't hurt them, let 'em. Two gays wanna get married? Three gays? Three gays and two lesbians? Who cares, if they're happy, healthy and helping the upkeep of society, who cares? 

To me, the ultimate conservative tennant was ""freedom"" - but I couldn't consider myself a libertarian, because I enjoy all the things that taxes brought. Roads, Emergency Services, public parks and works departments, events -- but at the core of it all, the reason we can have all this stuff, is absolute freedom. 

These days, being a conservative is constantly connected with being a racist or being a Nazi. So many people who identified as conservatives - either because they were Christian Dominionists, or because they're just flat out racists - are now feeling bold enough to fly their true colors, and are tainting what I always thought it meant to be Conservative - to be free.

Even opinions like ""tighter border control"" are just seen as racist. For instance, I think that border control should be strict, illegals should be sent home -- but it should be *fast, cheap and easy* to become a citizen in the first place. That's the point of America, that's what the statue says. We all work together. 

Now, the most important part of conservatism, and the only part that matters to me, freedom, has fallen to the wayside by what feels like a majority of people who held that label. Now it's racism, white purity, or some other bullshit.

While it didn't start consciously, once I recognized it I realized I did it for the reasons mentioned: low self-esteem, trauma, approval seeking. I have been in a bad place and needed people. One other reason that perhaps wasn't as obvious to those on the receiving end is that it helped me to find the answers to my problems, as when I found people with similar experiences I took in advice and was able to measure myself against everyone else to sort of ""find my place"" relative to everyone else, and to get to know myself better.

I've found my answers and I'm ready to stop. I've become annoyed with myself but its difficult to just change instantly, especially because I realized one of them (a hidden health problem) will take a bit to fix. So my questions are:

* Advice from anyone who has overcome this?
* Has anyone had a friend who has overcome this? Did they stop abruptly or did they ask for help in pointing it out?
* I feel like I almost have to apologize to my friends (that I still have) and notify them of this new commitment not to, but that itself also feels like oversharing, thoughts?
* Would it be weird if someone just stopped it and became more stoic and reserved?

55,"This is kind of a vent more than anything else.  I (20 m) just got out of a 5 year relationship with an emotionally abusive girlfriend and one of the biggest things she would always do is use the ""the girlfriend is always right"" joke seriously.  She would say it jokinglyish, but then when I objected would insist it was serious, and that she sees it all the time in real life.  I hated it, and told her so, but she kept using it until I just agreed to make it easier.


This is where the problem starts.  By accepting it, I started to truly believe it, and she started to really enforce it, to the point it really became the reality. I literally could not remember the last time I won an argument with her, no matter how trivial.  Yet I thought this was normal because of this kind of funny societal joke that we see in TV and movies so much, and that people joke about all the time.


I just kind of came on here to say something that is probably quite obvious to most people, but might now be for someone who was in an abusive relationship like me.  I didn't realize it was a joke, and I've heard of other immature couples who take it quite seriously, because the girl is emotionally manipulative.  I just want to say if your significant other ever makes you feel like you're wrong because of your role in the relationship, that is totally not ok.

While I understand it's a joke, I used to take it seriously when I would see it on Reddit or in the media.  That led to me being in that relationship way longer than I should have been, and I just want to say no one is ever right by default.

57,"This is sort of a crosspost from r/advice, though better organized.

For the last seven years I've been in love with a person who doesn't love me. I want to stop, but don't know how.

I love her because:    
-I see a better version of myself in her.    
-If I could, I'd lead a pretty similar life as her. I'm neither as sociable, nor as attractive.    
-She is the personification of all my ideals. She is smart, funny, beautiful and has a very rare and pleasant writing style. All this is hugely important to me.    
    
This is bad because:    
-She is the only person I've met in all my life who feels exactly right, celebrities and writers included. I suppose I could be semi-happy with someone else, but it would never be as good. Still, even that doesn't happen.    
-I extremely dislike explaining things I love to people who don't understand them. Most of my conversations are about the things I love.    
-My reasoning abilities, memory and sense of humour depend entirely on the people I talk to. This translates into the pleasure I get from conversations. She is the person I've felt absolute best writing to, even despite rejection.
-I don't meet many new people. I'm very lonely, though I have several good friends.    
-People who I can like are extremely rare. I spent about two years on Okcupid and Tinder, but have found only three girls I liked enough to attempt something, but none were inerested.    
-It hurts. It hurt so much my life became divided into two states: in one I'm semi-functional and can't feel anything, in the other I can do nothing but lie on the floor and want to die. My memory and coherent thinking are very fickle, and often fail me, most probably because of all the pain.    
-I handled the situation with her very badly. I can't help thinking that if I didn't make that many mistakes, I'd have a chance.    
    
What I did:    
-Accepted we'll never be together. She'd found a boyfriend at some point, I had no choice. It didn't matter, I still think of her as of my soulmate, it just hurts more because of the absence of hope.    
-Cut all the contact.    
-Went to a therapist. She was recommended to me by a psychologist friend as one of the best in my city, but all it ended with was her unsuccessfully trying to find something in my past that would explain this obsession. I got no advice nor any techiques that could help me. So I'm a bit suspicious when therapists are being treated as panacea.    
-Did sports.    
-Tried writing. This is a thing I love, but because of my fickle mental states it's not a reliable source of meaning or energy.    
-Tried to socialize with local discussion clubs.    
-Tinder, Okcupid and even match.com.    
-Escapism.    
    
What I'm prepared to sacrifice:    
-Time.    
-Money.    
-Efforts.    
-Dependency on other people for feeling good.    
-The notion of happiness as a destination.    
-The notion of love being the most important thing in the world.    
-My ability to feel.    
    
And no, I've gone to incredible lengths to not be creepy with her, which may have cost me the possible relationship itself.

66,I'm tired of all this hate.  It has gotten to me.  It makes me feel like shit when it gets to me and I go off on someone on the internet.  I don't know what to do.
