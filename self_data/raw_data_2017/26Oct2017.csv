1,"Bit of a strange one since a lot of people tend to struggle at focusing at work. But I have the opposite problem where I focus too deeply at work and thus I feel as though work consumes me throughout my life. 

The worst part is its a computer job, and when I'm working I basically fall into a trance. I have my music on and it feels I loose all conscious thought of myself and just am one with my work. Which is really terrible. 

Anyone else experience this?

3,"It kinda just slipped, generally when the garbage is taken out the manager just sit there and watch you work.

I recall this image of ""the difference between a leader and a manager"" and today I just happen to actually say it out loud.

Which whatever it is my job to take out the trash and didn't mean it to this person specifically.

Oh well adapt and survive or die evolution.

# more detail

Eh... it's just pathetic when you know you're dependent on others for your survival (reality)

As soon as I said that and he heard it I was like oohhh... and I just felt this flood of ""fear"" or whatever in my mind which I don't know if that's remnants of child upbringing but I think it's sad I feel that way. Granted i don't go out of my way to attack people or whatever and I didn't have anything bad against this particular manager or any of them for that matter. It's more a joke referencing [this image](https://benquirkblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/boss-v-leader-5.jpg?w=361&amp;h=207) but I understand it's not an appropriate thing to say out loud.

I don't know it's also pathetic to think I could be homeless (reality) if I lost this job but I also kind of welcome that challenge in a way I feel like my life is stale and I'm scared of life/need to get thrown into it and experience it/not be so scared.

So I accept the outcome whatever it is, probably keep going because I'm a ""perfect"" employee with regard to for 10-11 months I haven't missed a single day and I'm obedient (a broken man)

Oh well, work hard earn your value",26Oct2017,2
7,"So I met this girl on a dating app and we talked for a while and had some really good phone calls.

I asked her to the good ol’ generic dinner and a movie thing. She agreed and we finally met up.

At first it was really awkward, at least I thought so. We got to the movie and just sat and casually chatted(whole theater to ourselves too). About halfway through I pretended my arm was hurting from being on my arm rest the whole time and moved it to around her shoulder. She acknowledged the move by saying “that was smooth” with the cutest smile ever.

We had a bunch of good laughs and it went pretty well. After that we headed to Olive Garden and had a great dinner. Although it was a little on the awkward side for me because I was struggling with things to talk about, which usually isn’t something I have trouble with.

After Olive Garden we ordered a lyft and started heading back to her place. I was dreading it at this point because I was 100% sure she wasn’t ever gonna want to talk to me again after what I perceived as a 6/10 date at best(all my fault, not hers). 

Well I got out to walk her to her door and gave her a hug and then boom! SHE kissed ME! It was nice and warm, as kisses should be. She said she had a ton of fun and we should do it again soon. She told me to text her when I got home. 

I was so shocked and happy because I thought she wasn’t into me at all but obviously after the previous paragraph she is.

I texted her when I got home and we chatted about some stuff from the date and then she said sorry if she was awkward because she really likes me so she was nervous, and I said “yeah me too”. 

She said she was going to bed so I told her goodnight and she said goodnight cutie, which made me grin like a goofball.

What a great day. 

Edit - I’m 20 for those of you asking. She’s 19. ",26Oct2017,571
8,"Right now I am growing several marijuana plants in my backyard. I take photos of them every day so I can stare at them while I'm in the office during my breaks. I know they're not growing any quicker but I just have to look at them multiple times a day (and night). In the couple of months since I started growing MJs, I've already spent hundreds of dollars on regular, feminised, and autoflowering seeds.  It will take me years to grow them but I can't help myself.  

Before cannabis plants, my obsession were cacti and succulents. I got hooked on eBay auctions and collecting every type that I fancied. I spent thousands of dollars and hours at trade shows and garden centres to grow my collection. But I need to slow down, especially to leave room for my new obsession.

I grew up poor. I never had the things I really wanted as a child and teenager. But now I can afford to indulge all my passions and curiosities. But patience is not my virtue and I am incapable of moderation. I know I'll mature and calm down in time, especially with a sustainable supply of marijuana!

9,"Throughout middle school and high school I've been in and out of depression and been dealing with a worsening panic disorder. Now, junior year, I've finally left my previous friends to sit with some amazing girls who helped me organize a mental health program for our school (that's a whole 'nother story).

My high school combines two local middle schools, and when we arrived freshman year, my middle school friends joined a friend group mostly made up of guys from the other school. Naturally I followed, but those who did not know me for whatever reason had some natural beef with me. There was near constant bickering, and insults were thrown back and forth. My middle school friends being the only guys I really knew, I gave myself Stockholm syndrome and stayed with this group for three years, despite many heightened points of tension in which I was explicitly kicked out, and then re-added by my friends within the group (who admitted they did so to make sure I didn't kill myself). I convinced myself that the insults and arguments were endearing, and all in good fun. If everyone gets the short end once in a while, it's fine, right? Despite being relegated to the so-called ""B-team"" and the constant belittling from the more popular group members, I stuck with them, convinced they were the only people in the school I fit in with right up until two weeks ago.

After joining the Democrats club at the start of the year (to jeers of ""SJW"" from my ""friends""), I began to let my guard down and talk to some acquaintances from middle school. We then collaborated on the aforementioned mental health program (which so far has been making great progress) and something within me changed. By being exposed to these girls, and how they treated each other, my eyes were opened to the seemingly obvious fact that friends are supposed to be kind and supportive of each other. I remembered that normal friends don't constantly compete to out-roast each other. I realized the mental, and physical toll the toxic friends had on me. I explained my predicament to the girls, and they invited me to sit with them at lunch.

Now I look forward to each lunch break, happy to just sit down, and talk. I don't have to constantly watch my words to avoid giving them ammunition against me. I don't have to constantly look for a way to one-up them. I can just sit there, and joke, and laugh, and talk. I have this immense sense of relief--that I can just breathe for once. Despite the cliche, it really does feel like a physical weight has been lifted.

My critical social period was ruined by my mental health and those who I thought were my friends. I hope now I can make up for that. They already invited me to their Halloween party, the first party I've been invited to since a pity invite in freshman year.  It'll take some getting used to. Being in an all girl group as a straight dude will be a bit weird at first. But they support me, and that's what's important. I know high school drama sounds silly, and childish to those no longer in school, but this really is important to me. Today, after a more in-depth explanation of my previous situation, one  of the girls said to me ""you don't deserve to be treated like that."" I almost cried.",26Oct2017,3
12,"When you try to control everything, you enjoy nothing, sometimes letting go actually means having control. I’m sure the moment you have read this, you feel confused; how can letting go of control actually mean having it? Surrendering to what is, letting go of what was and having faith in what will be is the crux of our blog today.
Each person’s level of control differs and is primarily based on Extrinsic factors: The person your environment has molded you into or Nurture has endowed you with. This environment can be your family, friends, education, culture or your own interpretation of past life events. Based on these factors we design our own reality of control. For most of us this reality is kept in check when we believe a situation is working towards our expectations. However the real trouble come’s when we set expectation (whether real or unreal) about the present or future that does not seem to materialize. Its then that the little control monster living inside comes alive and decides to take measures that end up making the situation worse.

Let’s take a step back to evaluate why this happens; why do we hold on to things thinking ‘if I hold tight enough, it will come true’? Holding on to things and not surrendering to what is only creates a future that’s more messed up and validates your need to control eve n further (then we have a nervous breakdown).  It’s when we reach the absolute bottom and our life has spun so much out of control (control being the very thing we were trying to do in the first place) that we realize, things can’t be pushed or controlled. 

Say today I had the power to get whatever I wanted and all I want is an elephant, but the room I have is just big enough to sustain me and I’m not aware of that. What do you think would happen to me, my room and the elephant if this desire came true just because I wished it? Well I would get crushed and my house would be in shambles and in all probability I would blame the confused elephant for all my troubles. In reality I can’t wish things into existence, so I end up controlling my life and thoughts so much just to bring that elephant into reality. My control ends up tunneling my vision and clouding my judgment. All good things do happen with time and everything does happen for a reason. So there could be a reason behind me not getting my elephant that I may currently not be aware of.
Control is basically persistence without evaluation or introspection. So if you feel like things are not working out and people have started calling you obsessed or a control freak, you need to step back and evaluate yourself. When one door closes another opens, but if I’m so fixated on that one door I don’t see the opportunity of two elephants waiting for me behind the next.

So let me tell you 4 facts that a control freak like me accepted in order to become a recovering control freak:
• Fact 1: no one has control over the outcome of any situation 
• Fact 2:  No one can control how the other person feels, thinks, says or behaves
• Fact 3: Fear, uncertainty, self-doubt, ego/pride and lack of trust is food to the controller inside.
• Fact 4: You only have control over what you feel, think, say and behave
Steps to becoming a recovering Control Freak:
1.Address the Causes of control taking over: 
Having working parents, I was taught long ago to be self-sufficient. I started working after the age of 15 and looked after myself more often than never. Where on the positive side it made me a grown up faster and progress in my career at a very early age, it also showed me that I was the only one who could get the work done. It made me believe that ‘it was me against the world’ and only I could make my own reality. This actually made me lose trust in people and exponentially increased my pride and self-worth. So along with that, my fear of being obsolete increased as well; I used to think to myself ‘If I let go, what’s my purpose’. Each one of us would have experiences that made us into control freaks we are today. But its only after I addressed the causes of my insecurities, that I realized most of it was in my head
2.Ask yourself what would happen if…: 
My husband who then  was my boyfriend of many years asked me ‘What would happen if you let go?’. So I narrated a list of situations that would happen if I surrendered my control. His only response to most of them was “Really?”. I was still not convinced that my control was wrong. But when you have someone asking you ‘Really?’ enough number of times, you start asking yourself the question “What would happen if..?” before taking an action. Hence m y next step becomes really important: A buddy to remind you that you would still be valued even if you let go. Life carries on and your reality expands from a tunneled view to something that actually helps you grow as a human being.
3.The buddy system: 
It has taken me 5 plus years to become a recovering control freak. This recovery would not be possible without a great support system who reminded me regularly to let go. It was not just my husband that helped me; my boss and even my team. I am sure any manager reading this must be wondering, ‘How can your team help you let go of control’. It is difficult only for 2 reasons: 1. Perception of losing one’s position and respect 2. Perception of not being required. At the end of the day, it’s a perception that stops you, because if it were a reality we would not have teams, organizations or the need for friends and family. But let me tell you one thing through experience: respect, position and being required is earned and not forced upon. The moment I allowed myself to let go, they stopped fearing me and we actually could call ourselves a team.
4.Identify the positives of letting go: 
This last step is an affirmation on the reasons to continue letting go. Make a note of all the positives you have received personally, emotionally and mentally with letting go. Writing things down affirms your reasons for reformation.

There you have it my friends, the recipe to Letting go of Control and truly experiencing life.

Then one day I wasn't feeling good. He let me sleep in one of the cars. I overslept and he offered to take me home since I missed my bus. I said okay and thought it was nice. 

When we arrived,  he wanted to come inside for a bit. I said okay not thinking much of it cus I was still feeling ill. So, then it looked like his eyes turned pitch black. It was the scary look in his eyes and he told me to kiss him and show him what I was made of. He pulled me close to him and grabbed my butt and forced his tongue in my mouth. I told him he had to leave. He didn't want to but I told him to please leave. And he finally did. And I totally freaked out after he left. 

The following day, he apologized and told me not tell anyone. I promised that I wouldn't. I never did tell my mother. But ever since I moved on in life, I've been having crazy dreams about him.

35,"Okay so background- my nan passed away about three weeks ago and we held her funeral about a week or so ago, it was really sudden and everybody has struggled to come to terms with it.

Today I went to Nando’s for a big family meal and obviously the topic turned to Nan, and a few people round the table admitted that they have either had visions of her standing in their doorway, over their bed, or even had half-asleep-half-awake ‘visions’ of her getting into the bed next to them and telling them ‘not to worry’. All within the space of a day or two of each other.

My (very gobby) cousin then told the table that he had had a dream about her, and that I was in the dream too but it ‘wasn’t very good’, it didn’t take much pressing and he told me that Nan had said ‘I’m worried about motherofdragons10, she has a rare form of cancer’.

A lot of people may scoff at the idea of taking something somebody said in a dream seriously but it has played on my mind ever since, as I also quite frequently have very random thoughts about my being in hospital with cancer. Also, with everybody else’s shared experiences within the same timeframe without it being shared, it just seems odd. I also mentioned that my cousin is gobby because I feel as though if this was Nan reaching out, he would be the one to tell because he isn’t capable of holding his own water and he’d tell anybody who listened.

Im 28, the youngest of 4 siblings, and the only male. I should be grateful that I've never lost anyone that I was really close to until now, but I'm not feeling how I thought id feel. I know it's silly to have expectations of how you'd feel in this situation but it's made me feel weird. I think it's mostly confusion along with the grief, and looking back at good memories and stories people have about his life are the only thing that provides any sort of clarity.

I think the most troubling part is that cancer is fucking ugly and i hate it. What it does to a person in the end is just so awful, those last moments were honestly a little traumatic to see someone you love go through that. 

I don't really go in on archetypal roles very much but another thing is that I think my mother and sisters are looking to me to step up to be the patriarch a little bit, and I just don't know how to feel about that.
