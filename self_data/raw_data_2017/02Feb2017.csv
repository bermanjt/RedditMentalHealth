3,"I am one man, a nobody, an American. I was raised to be honest, sincere, and to treat others, as I want to be treated regardless of race, religion, or sexual orientation. I was raised to appreciate our cultural diversity and to understand that America is the starting line in this world for accepting those that are different from me. That it is precisely those differences that make this country so great. I am offended that we, as a nation have descended so far from where we were headed to what my mother would call, the “den of iniquity”. Now, when the world needs us the most, to show the way of acceptance, love and peace; we close up our borders, we exclude a specific people and, we turn on each other. Instead of helping nations understand that diversity is not only beautiful, but also necessary for the continued growth of the world, we pick sides, we bully and we arm both sides for the sake of greed. 

Have we not learned from our own history, and the history of the world that greed, racism, and power are the downfall of every empire? Have we not taught ourselves that we must learn from our own history so that we do not repeat it? If so, why are we repeating it, over and over? Every empire that has ever been, has crumbled from within, by the greed and power struggle from within it’s own ranks. Now, we have elected the antithesis of what this country was founded on, “That all men are created equal”. A man who believes in his heart that only the rich matter. A man that has admitted that women are less than, a man that publically humiliates and bullies those with disabilities. A man that is removing our freedoms and allowing for the purchase of public lands to private investors, a man that is alienating our closest allies by degrading them publically.  We have put a man who has no ability to hold a conversation about anything but himself into the most powerful position in the world. 

Here we are today, on the precipice of a catastrophic event, not only for us as a nation, but also for us as the human race. If we do not, as a people, unite under the banner of humanity, peace, love and acceptance, we will go violently into the night and never return. We must rise up to the power hungry and show them that we give them their power, that it is the meek that are strong and that we will no longer be subjugated to their greed, their rules and their law. We must show them that the law encompasses us all and that they cannot hide behind their wealth, status or power any longer. We must unite all races, religions, creeds and we must form the human connection of peace, tranquility and compassion regardless of the characteristics that make us unique as humans. We are all the same and that is something we must teach the world. It is something that has gotten lost over time and I do not believe it is too late, but we must act now. This is our moment, we must rise as a people and say, I am somebody.

4,"As I reflect on my weight loss journey (50 lbs. overweight). I think about how i will never let my future children get to where I am. I remember when i was young and we passed by a fast food place. My brother asked for it and my mom said yes. When I asked, she said no. When I was in girl scouts and we had snacks at our meetings which consisted of candy and juice, my mom said i couldnt eat it. She was even wary of me going to sleepovers cuz of the junk food. Most of my life I have been overweright, so i am not upset that she implemented this on me.

After a good 10 years of weight issues, bullying, a sexual assault, and childhood depression I am 20 and 50 lbs heavier than i should be. Since these terrible events i vow never to let my future kids eat this way. Nothing but healthy food for them. Water will be their drink and sometimes juice. No junk food either. If they complain, ill say ""do you want to be healthy and have friends or be fat and bullied?"" Indeed i have difficulty making friends and have none now and I want my childrens social lives to flourish. At least if theyre healthy its one step closer to a better social life i never had.

Today I stopped by to see what he wanted to talk to me about. When I get there, he takes me to his office and says ""I should probably mind my own business, but I've noticed that you have some acne stuff going on.""

I was so embarrassed. I felt my face get so red and I didn't know what to say. He told me that he was willing to pay for my acne treatment. He gave me a number and a name. I said thank you and left. Afterwards, I cried for several hours.

6,"All of my problems in my life have just built up in me, but I have no one to tell them to so... please just bare with me :-)

I'm currently a sophomore in high school and my life had been great up til 6th grade but this school year has proved to be by far the shittiest period in my life as of now. 

I've been going to a private school since I was in kindergarten, life was pretty great from around this time til junior high began. My parents were immigrants who came from Asia and worked extremely hard so that I didn't have to suffer like they did. My mom was a home care provider and my dad taught at a state university and had his own restaraunt... so we were very financially stable. When I was younger, life was great! My parents got along and I was such a daddy's girl, he would take me places and I loved spending time with him. I was such a happy, care free and confident kid. I was so close with my dad! But throughout the years my dad became an alcoholic, it was not a good mix with his workaholic demeanor. His restaurant's business went downhill and he kept it running only to sustain the cookie cutter persona everyone thought he had. Despite losing so much money my parents still sent me to this school because it was a good school with great education and a great inner community. The last time I probably didn't have to worry about money was 5th grade. Starting from 6th grade everything went downhill, we barely had enough money to let me stay at the school. 7th grade, I lost all sense of my self confidence. All of my friends became prettier while I was just there and ugly. 8th grade, things got better and I had regained my outward confidence, but on the inside I was the exact opposite. I didn't do the stuff I used to enjoy anymore out of fear of being judged by people. 9th grade, headed up to the school's high school and I completely bombed freshman year. No matter how hard I push myself to work I just can't. I know that it's on me to get myself into college because my parents don't have any money left in them. 10th grade (current), just a couple of days before the school year began my dad got a fucking dui for drinking while under the influence and just a day after, his father died. I feel so bad for my mom for being married to a man like him. He doesn't just mess up his life, he has to mess up everyone around him's life too. I can't take seeing my mom cry. The first time I ever saw her cry in front of me was on the day before this school started, we walked into admissions letting them know that we can't make it this year because an unexpected situation. It was heart breaking to see and I'm filled with so much anger for my dad because he is not willing to change even if it means ruining everyone's life around him too. OH DID I ALSO MENTION HE USED MY SAVINGS FOR COLLEGE HIM AND MY MOM PUT TOGETHER JUST TO KEEP HIS WORTHLESS RESTARAUNT RUNNING?!?!???!??! I honestly hate my life so much right now, I pray and I pray asking God why this is happening to my family. The little faith I have left in me is hanging by a thread. I don't know how I'm gonna get into college because my parents can't even afford to send me and I'm not talented in sports, art, music + I'm just an average student. I pretty much cry myself to sleep every single night wondering why my life has to be like this compared to everyone I know. Not even my closest friends and family members outside of my parents know about any of this stuff. My life is like a ticking time bomb and one day it's gonna explode and come crashing down.  

ps: sorry for my horrible grammar and spelling, I just really need to get this stuff off of my chest :(

13,"One of the main reasons we came back was because our lifestyles were getting more active and the air pollution was holding us back. So moving to America seemed the only logical thing to do.

Now it seems that Trump wants to be more like China has been in their complete disregard for the environment as long as it makes money.

And now the political climate is more toxic and dangerous than ever before. Especially for non-citizens. My wife is in China now for the holidays (Chinese New Year). I know it's extremely unlikely, but I'm half expecting some trouble at the airport. Stupid and reactionary, I know. But I feel what I feel.

Steve Bannon seems to think war with China is inevitable and as long as he is in the Whitehouse I don't think he's wrong. I always thought being married to someone from another country would have one major advantage — if shit hits the fan in one country, we could run to the other. Well, not anymore.

First it's mostly muslims... from certain countries. But it will escalate. And if there is a war with China, or even a proxy war, we're both fucked. My Trump supporting friends may not remember Japanese internment camps, but I sure as fuck do. Anti-China rhetoric has always been very popular in America, and it will only gain more support as time rolls on.

I just want a quiet life with my wife. I honestly think we will be positioning ourselves as close to the Canadian border as possible. If shit hits the fan, maybe we could run up there before the red hats come for her/us. 

It's so disheartening for me to see this happening. I can't imagine if she was from the middle east, I feel so bad for those couples/families. Must just be a horribly stressful time for them.",02Feb2017,2

On Monday, January 30th, my son was in a law class at the Career Center of his County School District.  While the teacher was discussing the Executive Orders recently submitted by Donald Trump, my son was having a private conversation with a friend in the same class.  Ultimately, my son said, ""I would kill Donald Trump if I had the choice or chance.""  The teacher overheard a bit and asked my son to repeat himself.  My son repeated, ""I would kill Donald Trump if I had the choice or the chance.""  The teacher called administration and had him removed from the classroom.  They put him in an in school suspension room alone and told him to write a statement.  The administrators then told him to call me because they were suspending him.  When he called me, I was stunned.  I called my fiance and he met me at the Career Center.  We both went in and had a conference with the Assistant Director, Guidance Counselor, and my son.  I was then informed the suspension was for 3 days and it being taken as a serious threat, because the teacher stated that my son said, ""I am going to kill Donald Trump.""  I asked for copies of all paperwork, making sure by the third copy of the referral that my sons statement and the name of the teacher was included correctly in the referral, and including the statement given by the teacher.  I was told I was not allowed to have it due to the sensitive information on it.  I asked how to appeal the suspension and was given the name of our County's School District Student Advocate.  We left the Career Center.  When I got into my car with my son, I noticed a city police officer to my right.  I thought nothing further of it and went home.  I called the Student Advocate and he said he would talk to the lawyers for the district and call me back.   I called a Lawyer Refferal Line and was given the name of a civil lawyer in case I needed to file a lawsuit with the district.  I made an appointment with the lawyer for next Tuesday.  The next day, my son tells me that he is hearing from friends that they are still discussing the incident the next day, and there are rumors that my son is going to be arrested.  I didn't think it was possible.  At some point the day before, the Student Advocate had called back, but I had missed the call.  He left a voice mail.  I return his call.  I do not hear from him on Tuesday.  On Wednesday afternoon, I get a call regarding my sons absences.  He has an auto immune disease and the nurses are worried he has the flu, based on him being marked ""Absent.""  His records were not being marked ""Suspended.""  I decide to go to the Career Center to find out about how his absences are being marked and if these rumors of him bring arrested are possible.   I speak with both the Director and the Assistant Director.  I am then informed that they were legally required to notify the police department. I was NOT notified that on Monday.  I was told that if he was being arrested, they did not know, but that a report WAS filed.  I requested a copy of the teachers statement again.  I was then told that if they could give it to me, they would.  I asked if it could be read to me.  The director agreed that I could hear it and if I was allowed a copy, one would be mailed to me.  I heard the report of the teacher, and it states that my son stated that he ""was going to kill Trump.""  I left the Career Center and went to the Police Department.  I spoke with the officer in dispatch and asked for a copy of the report and to speak with the officer to find out if my son was going to be arrested tomorrow at school.  I was later asked to leave my name and phone number so the officer could call me later because the report had not been filed yet.  I was told he would call me tonight or tomorrow to tell me if my son was either going to be arrested or had already been arrested.  The Student Advocate called me back later to tell me that the legal team had informed him that everything was handled properly by the Career Center Administration. 

My son is a teenager.  My son is a fairly good student that has a gigantic heart and a hard head.  He's always been hard headed.  That and his actions in school has always caused him to be labeled as a troublemaker of some sort.  Defiant. Disobedient.  Untruthful.  Challenging.  Willfully defiant.  But he's a good kid.  And he's a child, not an example.

I am taking my son to school tomorrow morning.  I will sit with him in the office, and I will follow his bus to the Career Center tomorrow.  I fully expect my son to be arrested.

I hope I can get people to tell his story if he is. 

This is NOT a drill.

17,"Just kind wanted to throw my thoughts out there, whether people read this or not, I don't particularly care, I just figured this is one of the few subs I could post this too without getting hate or banned.  Also sorry if this is incohesive, it's kinda a rant so sorry if I'm all over the place  Basically I'm concerned with where reddit is going in general.  What I mean by this is the increasing militancy and intolerance of reddit in general.  I hate how most subreddits have become an echo chamber and anyone who disagrees just gets hated on or banned.  You can see this on both sides of the spectrum, just visit The_Donald, and then Go visit a subreddit like Latestagecapitalism or socialism, there just everyone repeating the same opinions over and over again.  The other thing that worries me is all the calls for violence I see on reddit now.  The alt right was a perfect example, the things I saw on that sub honestly chilled me to the very bone, but them being banned, (which was incredibly needed and justified) doesn't solve the problem.  Just go to a different subreddit, I don't really know of any other right wing ones but people can probably fill in the blanks for me, or for example on the sub, socialism you can often time see people openly calling for the attack or murder of trump supporters.  I don't know where I'm really going with this thought, so I'll just end it with this, I just wish everyone didn't have to hate each other, and I wish everyone could just chill out.",02Feb2017,1

This all comes back to news organizations being allowed to report however they want, with no facts or evidence. The acceptance of simple bias from our news orgs has enabled them to make up news as they go. our news system is a joke.

I pretty much fell asleep straight away, and awoke a few hours later feeling his friend's fingers inside me. I just froze, and waited till it was over, then he just stroked my back and touched my butt for a few minutes before falling asleep.

When we went to sleep I was facing the other way with my arms around my boyfriend, and I don't think I've led him on in any way, we're all just friends. 
He also doesn't seem the type to do this. I know it's wrong what he did, but he's always been so nice and easy to get a long with, and has always seemed so loyal to my boyfriend. 

I feel if I tell my boyfriend he either won't believe me, or he'll end up losing his best friend, and the thought of telling him makes me feel even sicker than I already do. I just feel dirty and horrible and almost like I've cheated on him without meaning to. 

I really need some advice on how to deal with this, I hate keeping anything from him and feel this is just going to eat me up inside.

**UPDATE**

I can't believe all of the support, it's been scary sharing this despite being anonymous, but you've all really given me the courage to get this dealt with. 

Last night I told him what had happened. I nearly didn't but I asked to stay at his place instead because I didn't want to sleep where it happened and he got suspicious. I ended up crying (obviously), and just blubbed it all out. He said he's going to talk to his friend, and that his friend will probably end up being put in hospital (I didn't argue with him not to, there wouldn't be any point), but he remained surprisingly calm about it. He said it isn't my fault, that this guy obviously isn't his friend etc.

The only thing that concerned me was when I asked him what I should do about it. He said I don't need to do anything, only that he would deal with his friend.

I like seeing information in all forms and in some cases, I AM able to see information I wouldn't see anywhere else on Reddit because of a lot of censorship and post brigading that comes with it.

One theme that has started taking place not just online, but in real life is this act of calling people Nazis because they either voted for Donald Trump, they are assumed to have voted for Donald Trump, or they are involved in someway, shape, or form by association with an event dealing with Donald Trump and/or events like Milo Yiannopoulos at UC Berkley last night. Now there are memes going around to ""Punch a Nazi"". 

Ok let's clear one fucking thing up right now.  This isn't like calling someone a ""Cuck"" which has become a popular smear by people on the Alt-Right or even online persona's who support Donald Trump.  Sure, it's insulting to a degree as it's meant to emasculate someone, but calling someone you disagree with intellectually a Nazi..when an ACTUAL Nazis intentionally participated in the Holocaust, tortured and murdered other human beings (Jews most notably) and are the cream of the crop some of the most disgusting people this planet has ever had, is just mind blowing.  The right are not being violent. Yes, there are members on both sides, but especially the right who are ignorant, racist, and all around fuck-tards...but right now calling them Nazis and 'punch a nazi' it's literally promoting violence against other people. The violence we are seeing are NOT from the right or the republican base.  

You have social media, celebrities, and other prominent figures who are not even trying to calm the democrats down. They are in fact doing the opposite and trying to incite more anger, more violence, and keep the fire burning hotter. Like what in the fuck. Promote protests, promote fighting back against Donald Trump because you disagree with him on whatever level you disagree with him on, but the protests that are turning violent and ending in chaos, destruction of property, injuring people, and setting shit on fire needs to fucking stop. 

Also, I get that the majority of protesters are there to do it peacefully, and you have these small anarchist groups who want to turn the knob to 11 and are likely the perpetrators behind the chaos, but nothing is being done to stop them or calm things down.  I watched several hours of live streams last night of the Berkley 'protests' aka riots / terrorism, and I barely saw any cops, barely any law enforcement.  The University knew well in advance there would be protests, and they know the state of the country and despair taking place..so they knew the chances of chaos and violence were more than likely going to happen.

It is very worrying what is happening in our society right now, it's literally crumbling before our eyes and the end result is not going to be pretty. I hate to fucking say it, but republicans are the gun owners. The alt-right are the gun owners. These are the people trying to protect the 2nd amendment while democrats have looked at ways to limit what the 2nd amendment allows. If shit comes down to some kind of a civil war, bringing knives to a gunfight won't work well.  

Look I don't like Donald Trump. I don't like some of his policies. However I am also mindful that a good chunk of our country has hurt while under 8 years of Obama and while everyone thinks he was the 2nd coming of Christ, he had his fair share of actual issues and problems that he imposed on the country and the world. So democrats and citizens need to push back on Trump where it makes sense, and do it intelligently and with the right methods. 

What they are doing right now, isn't fucking working NOR will it fucking work.  I hate Glenn Beck, HATE him..but he said on Anderson Cooper recently ""Look, Donald Trump might take punches, but he punches back, and when he does it is TWICE as hard"".  

So for all the fears, anger, and hatred the democrats want to translate into what is happening now as a 'method' of Protesting Trump..they are signing our own fucking Executive Orders. The shit these people fear, the laws and protections they fear are going to get removed...they are literally behaving and doing the types of things that WILL get them removed.  

Nobody seems to be working with President Trump, or even trying to, they are working against him HARD..and it's been like 13 fucking days.

I apologize for the long post. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone I know. I just need to get this out.

I'm sorry if this isn't the best place to post this. I'll try a different place if need be. 

I’m a seventeen year old girl in the US. I should be in my second semester of sophomore year in college, but I dropped out this semester. I graduated high school at fifteen, but wasn’t pushed to try for amazing colleges and had no real idea of what I wanted to do with my life. I still don’t know. I enrolled in my local university (I live in a college town) and attended for three semesters before realizing it wasn’t working out. I’ve been taking gen ed classes, branching out, trying to find something I like, but there’s nothing. I have no motivation to continue schooling.

I did okay my first semester, stopped caring by the second, and failed every class in my third. I had a full ride scholarship and lost it. I gained forty pounds from my senior year of high school.
I couldn’t afford to attend this semester and continue failing, so I decided to take it off until I had a better idea of what to do. 

It’s not even that college was that difficult. I just didn’t put in the work I needed to succeed, because I felt like it didn’t matter. I stopped caring. I stopped attending a lot of classes by the end of my third semester. I lied to my mom about my grades. I stopped talking to most of the few friends I had. Maintaining relationships felt like too much work, and when I want to reach out again, I thought it was too late.

I lost most of my friends when I left. I’ve told maybe ten people I left school. The only person in my family that knows is my mom. Not even my younger brother knows. I’m ashamed of myself, but not enough to change. I come from an Asian family, and school is a very important to them all. I didn’t tell my mom I was having any problems until there were only two weeks left in the semester, when it was much too late to redeem my grades. She was very supportive of me, and asked me what I wanted to do with my life. I didn’t know then, and I don’t know now. I have a lot of pride, and swallowing that and telling my mom was the hardest thing I did all year.

I have low self esteem. I hate everything about me. The one thing I thought I had, my intelligence, has left me. My house is a mess. I have no energy to do anything. I don’t make plans with anyone but my best friend. It’s surprising that I even have one. I have so little energy that I walk slowly. Even lifting my arms is a chore. I feel helpless in my own body. I’m terrified of being a college dropout. I feel like I had so much potential at one time. Did I just burn out?

I resent myself for feeling this way. There are so many people with so many more problems than mine. I feel selfish. I don’t want attention, which is what I think is stopping me from trying to get help, should I need it.

I have a loving, supporting family. This shouldn’t be happening to me. I don’t know what’s wrong. I feel so overwhelmed.

I spend my days online at a local coffee shop. I had a job at my favorite bookstore, but lost it recently. I tell myself that I’m going to try different things with all of this free time that I have. I’ve gotten into knitting. I play some video games. But most of the time, I don’t care. I feel like nothing matters and I’m a failure anyway so it doesn’t matter. I have no energy every day. I get up in the mornings to take my brother to school and then I just sit there. Getting up feels like a chore. Going out with people is hard. I leave the house for the coffee shop because I don’t have wifi at home. The only person I talk to daily is my best friend. He helps me a lot, but he doesn’t know any of this. I hide it all. I throw a smile on for everyone I see when all I feel is nothing.

When I first joined Reddit, I used to laugh at everything. I laughed at every joke and smiled at every quip. Just today, I realized that I laugh less. I’ll read a comment and find it amusing, but other people find it absolutely hilarious and laugh out loud. I was always a very social person and make friends easily, even in uncomfortable situations. I used to be so good at starting conversations. I was charismatic and friendly. I don’t know what’s changing. I don’t care anymore. I don’t feel anything. When I do feel, it’s brief and fleeting. I smile for a second and then it fades. My face settles back into neutrality and I stare into the nothingness until someone calls out to me. Why do I laugh less? I don’t want this.

I used to love the guitar, but I picked it up for the first time in months yesterday. I lost my callouses. My fingers were so sore. It hurt, and I realized I had lost a part of me.

Music used to be a huge part of my life. I would sing to myself every day, and always surround myself with music. I drive in silence now. I sit in silence. I sleep in silence. I eat in silence.

I had a huge passion for reading. In high school, I read every single day. I checked out four books a week from the library. I’ve read less than fifteen books since I started college.

I used to care about dressing well, and always looking presentable. I loved it. Now I do laundry every four weeks and wear no makeup and go to places wearing sweats.

I don’t find things beautiful anymore.

I cry a lot for no identifiable reason. I had my first breakdown last week where I just cried and cried for hours and I didn’t know why. I was feeling fine, until I wasn’t. I was with my best friend and just started sobbing and couldn’t say anything and he just held me until I stopped. I resent myself for what I’ve become. I’m the failure of my family. I have no passion or ambition. I don’t care for life anymore. I don’t want to go back to school.
These are things that I’m only noticing right now, as I’m typing this. I’ve felt this way for months, but it all multiplied when I left school. I do my best to not let anyone know I’m anything less than okay. I don’t do drugs, and rarely drink, so substance abuse isn’t a problem.

Yesterday, my best friend told me he was worried about me. He worried that I might be depressed. He also reassured me that he was there for me, and would listen.

I’ve thought this myself before, but never took it as something serious. I felt like if I told anyone I’d be clamoring for attention. Today, I did more research than I ever have on depression and anxiety. I learned that the two often go hand in hand, but I do not think that I have anxiety. I don’t worry constantly about things, and can shut down my brain and think about nothing very easily. However, I have casual suicidal thoughts often. I drive a lot, and will calmly think about driving my car off a bridge or into a tree. I get so tired of life. I feel like I’m going nowhere, and that death would be a release from it all. I wouldn’t have to worry anymore. I think of the consequences of it, of what people would say. But then I feel like a dramatic teenager and downplay my own problems to myself. I feel like everyone feels this way and I’m just being dramatic. I don’t want the depression stigma to apply to me. I don’t want to be just another angsty teen.

I feel like I’m wasting my time. Since the semester started, I’ve done nothing. Nothing has changed. I feel like I’m wasting what little potential I have left. I wanted to be someone, once. Now I’m nothing. I’m just another college dropout.

I took multiple tests from multiple mental health sites, to try and learn more. On every one, I scored from a 19-23 on a scale of 1-27. This would be a cue to talk to my doctor, but I’m underage. I rarely go to the doctor. If I get help, it would be on my own. I don’t want to talk to my mom about it.

Here’s the thing, though.

I feel all of this, and I know it’s genuine, but in the back of my mind, I know I have people that are there for me. I know that I’m not alone, but it doesn’t stop me from feeling so. I feel like I’m just being self-pitying and resent myself more. I don’t understand. Is this normal? I keep telling myself I’m okay, but maybe I’m not.

I feel like everyone and their brother has depression and that a lot of people overplay the effect it has on their life. I have a stigma in my head about depression. I feel like an attention seeker even writing this.

Please, Reddit, ask me anything. I feel like I’ve left a lot out. I need to know if I should seriously try seeking help. I’ll answer anything about me. I need to know. I don’t know if I’m explaining myself well enough. I just need to talk to someone. I feel so alone.",02Feb2017,4
44,"I'll start.  Local radio station has a joke contest, the winning prize is $94 and (a long sleeve t-shirt or thick hoodie).  I source my jokes from /jokes, and I have won about 20+ times in the last 3 years! I have also gotten a reputation with the Radio station DJ's for the sick jokes I submit.  Every week they read at least one of the jokes I submit.  This all came at a time when I really needed the money.  I also continue to submit jokes even when I'm ineligible to collect the prize money; this happened at least 3 times. I won so many times, I donate the shirts to a local hospital to give to people who have little clothing upon discharge.   Recently, the contest offered an additional prize of 4 Lewis Black The Rant, White &amp; Blue Tour tickets.  I sold that shit and bought me some /trees! ",02Feb2017,2
45,"It really frustrates me when people consider 16-17 year olds children. Like theres a very clear disconnect between a 14 and a 17 year old mentally and physically. I just find it strange that America considers these two groups as both children while in my country, those 16 to 18 are considered young persons but not children and the age of consent is 16. 

This is coming from an 18 year old so Im quite interested to hear about your opinions on this.",02Feb2017,2
52,I've been doing mdma a bit too often and it's not like ruining my life or anything but it's definitely something I look forward to. Anyone dealt with mildish addiction know when's the time to try to quit? Or how to know when it's too much?,02Feb2017,1
53,"People on the internet are literally encouraging the level of violence to escalate. This needs to stop as the logical conclusion is elevated chaos and suffering. Comments encouraging violence against anyone should be considered a bannable offense. How smart is it to encourage assaulting a group that is statistically likely to be carrying guns? The logical conclusion of encouraging and normalizing violence is that violence is going to increase. I'm not a Trump supporter, I'm just afraid that people are participating in making the world worse without realizing their part in it.

54,Computer Science. I keep everyone saying that it's so easy to get a job. What I've experienced has been the opposite. It's ridiculously hard. I've been unemployed since graduation. I get interviews and I don't. Tech companies seem to recruit only a specific set of the best. This translates me into having no chance. Other companies seem like a scam. Just visit dice.com to see the millions of scummy recruiting companies that exist only to sell your data. I have no clue how people get a job. The market is horrible.,02Feb2017,5

62,"So my Girlfriend and I try to plan an annual trip to Las Vegas for spring break and this year was no different. I was talking to a buddy of mine who I work with about our trips to Las Vegas because he goes there all the time. I was asking him ideas on which Resort we should try this time and he mentioned that his cousin works at one of the resorts in Vegas so maybe he can hook us up with a good deal. I said that sounds awesome so he went ahead and sent his cousin an email.

Couple days pass and my coworker lets me know that he booked me in a suite. Obviously I was pretty happy because we have never stayed in a suite on the Strip before. I asked him if I could get the total cost and the confirmation which he tells me he didn't receive from his cousin yet so he will go ahead and shoot him a text. His cousin my coworker know that he will get me the confirmation when he gets home.

Well the day passes I never receive an email. It's okay I figured he would get back to me eventually because maybe he forgot. A couple days pass and I still haven't received an email. I asked my coworker if he could maybe remind hi and see if he could send me the confirmation. I didn't want to feel like I was nagging but I also wanted to confirm our details for our upcoming trip.

My coworker sent him a text and he doesn't get a response. At this point even my coworker is getting a little concerned as it has been 3 days with no response. He calls up some family and get some answers. Turns out his aunt found out and never spread the news, she didn’t want other people to worry or freak out. 

Turns out he was in a car crash three days ago and he badly damaged his leg. Apparently it was jammed into the door because a drunk driver hit him on the freeway. So he was hospitalized. Knowing this my coworker panics because his cousin has no family out there. He booked a flight to go visit him and help him deal with applying for workman's comp and dealing with the hospital.

He goes out and visits his cousin, talks to the hospital and also talks to his cousins boss about the situation. Everything is going smoothly so far. Obviously at this point I don't really care too much about the reservation want to make sure that he is okay.

My coworker comes back to work a couple days later to give me an update. He lets me know that his cousin is recovering and will be in the hospital for a month or so. We chit chat about vegas some more and have a good time. I also tell him don’t worry about the reservation, my girlfriend and I booked a refundable reservation as a contingency plan just in case things fall through. Should he get better in time for our trip we’ll gladly take the suite he offered us. 

Literally hours after that conversation my Coworker gets a call and tells me he needs to leave. He walks out and is on the phone for about an hour before he comes back in. Hes crying. His cousin’s leg caused a blood clot that the doctors missed and it made it to his brain and killed him. 

My co-worker was devastated. But in retrospect if it wasn’t for me attempting to go to vegas on my spring break, my co-worker may have never even seen his cousin beofre his passing. So I guess thats the only good thing to come out of it.

63,"I used to work for a company that sold cars to soldiers overseas. My co-worker and friend worked for us in Iraq for a period of time selling cars and Harley to soldiers.

A soldier had ordered a Sportster for his deployment present. He used some of the extra deployment cash to pay in cash for the bike.

Tragically a few weeks before he was set to go back home he was injured in an IED explosion and later passed away to his injuries.

My Co-worker finally got in touch with the guy wife as we had something like $9,000~ of this guys money and we were fully prepared to cancel the entire deal and give the money back as we didn't think the wife would want the Harley and the cash would be helpful.

Well she did want the Harley, she wanted the Harley for her son to remember his father by.

So when this hit upper mgt they said ""Screw this, she's getting the bike for free""

So we refunded all her money, and had the Harley dealer trailer the bike to her house.

Was just reminiscing with said co-worker today, he said as of a few months ago the Harley is still sitting in the Garage and the son who is now in middle school pretty much sits on it every night.  

**I was not involved in this deal, I only know about it because my friend was the sales man for this order**",02Feb2017,7
