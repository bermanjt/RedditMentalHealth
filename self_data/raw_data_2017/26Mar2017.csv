and the media companies wonder why people pirate shit. FFS

granted im not downloading anything im just finding shit online to stream, but if i have the top two streaming services at my fingertips why do i have to find shit online to stream?",26Mar2017,5

4,I’m so fucking sick of always being “the homie” or “the fuckbuddy.” Fuck this constant giving myself to people who aren’t deserving and fuck me for putting myself in this position.,26Mar2017,5
5,"I used to be a musician, an athlete, I was well read, had a lot of friends, loved animals and nature, had so much love for so many things in life and just wanted to experience as much of it as possible, and help as many other people as possible and share myself with as many other people as possible.

Now I try to get the biggest and newest and loudest of everything because I want to make other people envious, and if I can't do that, at least try and bother them with my shit personality so much that maybe one of them will try and kill me.

A lot happened between those two paragraphs to bring me to where I am, but the bottom line of it is I don't remember what it felt like to actually care about anything.  Every now and then I feel like this should bother me, so I try to make an effort to feel something again, then I don't, so I just go back to this.  Actual happiness is a one-time deal.  After that, well, I guess you either end up in a position like someone like me or you're on the receiving end of the shit of someone like me who's just trying to ruin everyone's day because he can't do suicide (I did try a couple times when younger but failed, so I know I'm just not one of those people who gets to leave when their life is over).  You have the power to be me once happiness is over or you're at my mercy.  And I'm at the mercy of people bigger than me who have run out of happiness as well.  So even realizing what a crap person I am doesn't make me feel bad, because I know someone else would just take my place if I gave it up, and everyone above me is doing the exact same thing.  It's just people.  Youth is nice.  Then it's all a crap chute.",26Mar2017,3
7,"Things I've noticed: Despite eating lots of meat bread and cheese, everyone seems much healthier than the average American - I believe this is because German food is way less processed. Their public/government funded systems are lightyears ahead of ours - their trains and busses are amazing, quiet, clean and pretty cheap, also most public facilities in general are very clean and feel up to date. Masculinity isn't as emphasized, and the German men I've met seem to be much bubblier than American men. This could be a large claim, but I feel like all of the things wrong with America are due to capitalism. It feels so right to be able to walk into a grocery store here and not be bombarded with crazy colorful ads and junk food. You walk in and it's just food, mostly really fresh and much cheaper than in America. The junk food is interspersed and there isn't nearly as much of it. The one somewhat negative thing I've noticed is that people seem to be slightly less individual here. Everyone dresses pretty much the same and you don't see as many people ""being themselves,"" at least in an American sense. Does anyone have any thoughts?",26Mar2017,4

11," Speech impediment is a worldwide challenge, This invention of   known as the only effective appliance for stutter correction .With its help, stuttering will no longer be a difficulty that causes people so much vexation. people can correct their stuttering problem as conveniently as near-sighted people buying a pair of eyeglasses.This method is attributed to a small anti-stuttering device.How does it work? A certain kind of resistance (repulsive force) is produced between the upper jaw and the lower jaw in the oral cavity, and the correction effects just come from reacting against this resistance. Its functions are as follows:1. Delaying function. The repulsion of two magnets generates resistance, thus slowing down the speech speed and also delaying the occurrence of stuttering. Stuttering is not permanent: it only occurs when the person spokes too hastily. Once it is delayed, the sentences are completed and stuttering does not occur.2. Traction function. When a stutterer is silent, he or she must apply force. As a result, their muscles coordinate with each other. The force of the language organ muscles of the stutterer will be pulled by the magnetic force, and thus stiffness( reduced muscle tension) will not form. This can lessen stuttering.3. Mandatory function. Stuttering is a habitual occurrence. Only mandatory stimulation can change the habit of stuttering. Otherwise, stuttering correction will not succeed. Although the working principle is simple, it is the key to correcting stuttering.
This tool is used by people who stutter. It can also be used by average people and hearing-impaired people for language exercises.

16,"I suppose one of the things I find more frustrating about persistent intellectual posture is how easy it is to ignore where and how it creates cramps. I can bend and balance boxes of 2-liters for hours and inevitably will start to feel a little knot form or a wave of pain. You sit down all day and need to lift your arms above your head and roll your neck or swivel side to side. An intellectual posture allows you to say the same thing over and over again, and instead of setting off a warning sign that there's a need to stretch or get a massage, the neural pathways you've created to work yourself into that position get reinforced each time you assert it or you hear that someone agrees with it.

As infinitely complex and confused perceptual beings, we're blind to the “true” nature of reality. I don't believe we will ever find the words, run the experiment, or dig up “42” in an act of cosmic comedic justice. This isn't what we want though. We want the explanatory power that infects and translates or gives us the groundwork from which to build. The more you understand about quantum systems, the cooler the devices you get to take pictures of your dick with. Find the evolutionary ingrained model for social being or mental pathologies, turn your abusive parents into categorically immature and unintelligent narcissists with oedipal complexes and mood disorders; the more adjectives, the easier to swallow and maybe cope with or develop a strategy for combating.

We want the story because whether we're particularly adept at articulating it or not, we want the story to *mean something*. We want it to reflect our values, what we've worked or sacrificed for, perhaps what many members of our tribe have died for. The problem being, there's no end to the amount of things any one person may find valuable or ways in which they'll choose to try and approach them. So you get extremely specific scientific disciplines arguing so minutely that *maybe* 3 or 4 people in the entire world even have a shot of knowing what the hell they're talking about, let alone be able to discern the truth of either one. The other side of the spectrum gets you an endless ethics debate regarding the relative imperative to behave in accordance with the tenants of *the really peaceful religion*.

Here I'll note a reason I approach writing the way I do. There's a very specific and infrequent utility I get from truly picking out the individual lice of insight on the infected head of some topic I'm exploring. 99 times out of 100, absolutely no one wants or cares to read the book I read, or the Jacobin article giving you the ten page history of why your modern union sucks ass, or the Guardians of the Galaxy comics so you can appreciate how disappointing I felt the first movie really was. They want an impression of my approach to whatever it is that concerns *them*. They either want someone to mirror and add, or swallow. 1 in 100 want to genuinely talk or debate and perhaps learn something new. It is true that I find details interesting and vitally important depending on your task. Details aren't going to give you an impression of “me” and my process, they're going to reduce me to a pedantic research paper “wowing” you with my capacity for citations.

Another way to state the above paragraph is that there is no point to how I write but to try. It has set with me for a long time the psychopath (and I use that term technically) who attacked the very idea that I would even bother at all when *so many better philosophers* have said it before. It's like an archetypal ignorance. I couldn't possibly phrase intellectual and cultural suicide better. Every morality story you hear in church has been passed down from “already figured out” sentiments our ancestors learned from fighting the environment and each other. Every step forward, be it technologically or in terms of morality, builds on the breaking down and reiteration then reorientation of models and experiences that, say every 40 or so years, 1/3 of the population hasn't necessarily experienced. In 2 years, how many younger obliterated freshman during Little 5 are going to stop and remember to make a reference to 9/11?

It seems stories about tragedy, war, and mass death are turning into failures of retaining and translating the meat of why they happened meaningfully. 9/11 will get a commemorative stamp. Someone will put a statue up memorializing the Pulse nightclub victims, naively inspired by a little girl staring down a bull as a statement regarding intrinsic value or consequence. What to do with the details, when they matter so so much but are often so many and so complicated they get lost to the lazy symbolism or furiously debated into pieces so small you can't really pick them up anymore?

I think you have to learn how to orient yourself in relation to those details. You have to get a higher consciousness perhaps about the nature of what it means to hold something as a distinguishable entity. Say at the level of the neurochemistry of your brain, it can't differentiate between the positive rush from coffee verses cocaine verses the best sex of your life. But you're not just your brain, at least, you don't act like it, so you impose a value and relative utility in how you choose to get the channels flowing. You can look for the hidden orientations of your mind with digressions like these. You can surprise yourself by stumbling forward into manifest value.

It's something of a confusing and seemingly perfectly arbitrary process. Why write...just anything? Whether I want it to or not, my brain is working. It's taking my experiences and matching them against my expectations of the world and of myself. And it's doing it with more neural connections than there are atoms in the universe. That I could distill a single sentence is a miracle. That I might give you an impression or insight by peeking so far into my mind I'm actually in yours is an act of God.

And you don't like that. Not one bit. And you don't like that because to take on the burden of what it means to be God is infinitely taxing. It's an obliteration event. You can't be “you” if you're God, as it's understood in modern terms. What an act of ignorant pride! You don't know everything! You are not everywhere! You are not the underlying Truth of MY morality! So you learn pretty quickly how intellectually deficient an ideologue is as they summarily dismiss you and often condescend to pray.

The issue being, you are God too, incidentally, the angry destructive one that no one seems to understand but keep sacrificing for. Surely one needn't know *everything* to know a significant amount about that which they are and how it tends to behave. Not a single person on the road deemed it practical or necessary to drive on the wrong side and cause an accident today. In all of my Godly wisdom, without ever saying it out loud, I predicted as much and it came true! How does one know the future if not by divine right? As to the morality of not running your car into others deliberately, how'd you learn not to do that except by the normalizing factors of your culture? Of course I'm your truth, because you haven't killed me off despite the murderous intent I can see in your eyes. A murderous intent that happens everywhere and in everything where Gods like me attack lesser Gods like you in manners like this.

We don't say our goals out loud, so we're constantly disagreeing about, literally, “nothing.” The goal of a “productive” conversation is to get the point of what the person is telling you and see if it has anything to do with how to better orient yourself later. When you get into an argument, and you assume it's about “winning,” it seems more a misfiring of your threat systems. Your goal isn't to escalate until you get a divorce or kill the other person to defend your opinion. Your goal is to be understood or achieve some form of reciprocity, when all you've done is offered a baseless proposition floating in the might-as-well-be-empty head-space of your mind.

This comes out with the phrasing of things like, “I was only trying to help!” Help what? Help who? Help how? You have a very vague feeling and notion of what constitutes “help,” and by not parsing it out, you're throwing yourself in to drown along with the person you think is trapped under water.

So you can think about this when people, in my view, very ignorantly attack the idea that science can't speak to human values. They point to the tenuous assumptions in science that the observable universe is fundamentally capable of being understood to the point of absurdity. It doesn't matter if we get to “42,” it matters that it's irrelevant your opinion of clitoral castration for example, it's an unnecessary harm inflicted on vulnerable women where it should be *obvious* there's a *meaningful* reason to eradicate the process objectively. Science, the study and accurate accounting of the material world in which we operate, can help dispel the empty-headed idea that vilified genitalia. (Empty insofar as to what we understand today as it's reasonable to conclude much of our ingrained attitudes and relationships are influenced by the complicated dangers regarding sex as we progressed.)

Of course we're all flailing about in the infinite waters of confusion and entropy. But *more of course* our very capacity for, not just perception, but *motivated* and reproducible perception means we need to adopt a mode of starting from a shared place and stating a goal AFTER we've done the work like this to bounce around the universe of our own mind to figure out just what it is we're even bothering to talk about, worry about, or set out to fix or achieve. There's a very large list as to why that doesn't happen, presumably the confusion or frustration you might feel trying to follow a blog like this and immediately concluding, indeed mylinating, the “no point” circuitry top amongst it.

I get very dismayed when I hear spot-on heavily tested and investigated stories for either my own behavior or something I've noticed in my family. If I were to try and “bring this home” as it were, without hesitation you can rob yourself of your identity, and therefore responsibility, by couching your understanding *too convincingly* in any paradigm that relies on your capacity to make an ill-informed “truth” claim. It doesn't matter the doting mother scared of being alone provokes her only son to overcompensate, and indeed run far away, in EXACTLY the manner as has happened between my second cousin and aunt. My degrees of openness and conscientious thoroughly predicted I'd be writing this thought digression after 17 hours of practically nonstop work. But that doesn't remove my responsibility for what it says or choice to write it. It's one blog, one piece, of all that is me, I have been, or am trying to be. Like every detail, it informs, but it's only *the Truth* to the degree in which you want to deify me, which you don't want to do. But how many other ideas from other deities are you doing that with right now? How many variations of other peoples' hells are you roasting in? And can you articulate why you chose them, if you chose them, and if there's a way out? That's the kind of story that's meaningful to me.",26Mar2017,5
18,"I've always worn [those cheap Casio watches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W). I love the simplicity they represent - they just do their simple job really well without showing off: no attempt to signal wealth or taste, no attempt to add ""features"" in the pursuit of capitalist progress. 

Also I could never really afford anything else.

However in 10 years I've already owned about 4 - they're so cheap that when the strap-pin gets bent or a button stops working you just buy a new one. You can see them as representing the disposable culture that globalisation has given us. So I started thinking, I have money now -  maybe I should buy something beautiful, and something that's designed to last and be repaired.

Anyway my watch broke last night and now I've been sat on the sofa for 2 hours obsessing over it. I'm either going to become a bragging Wolf-of-Wall-Street expensive-watch-owner or a reprehensible pawn in the decline of humanity into wastefulness. There is clearly no middle ground. Please help.

Im 23 now and i have just kinda come to terms with this fact. 

  Anyways, i remember my dream from last night, i was for some reason at a school and i was sitting in a classroom, the one thing i remember is i kept staring at a girl. Finally the girl turned around and i realized who it was, it was a girl i have had a crush on and attempted to date for a good amount of time (unsuccessfully i will add), like 8 years. She didnt even acknowledge me. I dont know why i had this dream but it just kinda hurts you know? Its like my subconscious is taunting me with her.

23,"I've always suffered from severe anxiety. My family tells me that I used to be a loud and active toddler, but as far back as I can remember I've usually felt quiet, anxious and scared, even with my own parents.


I started to avoid going outside in middle school. I had my first panic attack at 14. I got pretty depressed, a year later I attempted suicide and started self-harming. Since then I go through the same cycle of depression, anxiety, and dealing with them in unhealthy ways. Occasionally things get better but never for long.


I haven't lived at home since the age of 16, and I suppose I idealise my mother in my mind when I miss her, but coming back home and hearing these words brought back so many memories. I realise how hard she had to work to raise me, and that I'm being ungrateful etc etc, but fuck. her.

I asked her to let me get professional help as a kid, my school teachers told her to take me to a therapist and every time she got offended. Because guess what, she didn't believe in 'mental health' because that's not a real thing. I would try to talk to her, to make her understand and she would yell at me for being dramatic and wanting attention. 


She had the same exact reaction when she discovered I was self-harming when I was a teen. Want to know how she decided to help me out? By criticising every little thing about me (well, even more than she already had). The way she explained it, I was acting this way because of my thin skin, and she was helping me ""thicken it up."" And yeah, I've never been the kind of a child you'd be particularly proud of, but fuck, how do I deserve to be constantly ridiculed?

And now she's read some bullshit article about how vaccines cause autism or whatever and has decided that's what I must have. Obviously.

It started as I was driving and exiting and alley, and stopped to let a group of pedestrians cross. A woman there had a large tattoo on her arm, it looked nice to me, and I thought maybe she got it just because she thought it would look nice like that.

There was something unusual about that thought. It didn't have a kind of emotional weight that I'm ordinarily accustomed to. In this particular case probably it was about how a tattoo is a life-long marking that may not look good later on. That's probably a perspective my mother taught me. I guess the long-term concern and/or negativity there is the ""emotional weight"" I'm accustomed to.

Afterwards, this perspective kept coming back to me a bit regarding various things in my life. I only really got partial glimpses, and not like the full picture though. It seems like the emotional attitude I have toward making decisions in my own life is loaded with an emotional significance that is a result of a drama that I create. It's like a false emotional significance, and not the natural emotional significance of the actions. It's like a manufactured layer of emotions hiding a deeper more genuine layer of emotions, or something like that.

Hello. 

I'm Alex. 19, about to turn 20. 

College student. Stem major in Kentucky. Lonely af yo

So this all started with a girl. Happened 3 days ago.

I had joined the skate club at my school when I realized that my ""friends"" didn't really like me. They had almost completely stopped talking to me except when they had to. My roommate is better friends with them than I am, but they all like him better, so I'm always there when they come to get him for dinner, that's the only time I get to talk to them. They stopped answering my texts. And sometimes my roommate will just leave to go hang out with them and I'm not invited. 

So yeah. Pretty terrible friends. 

But that's not the point. I had joined the skate club to make new friends, and that was going alright. Met a couple of cool guys. One I had skate with a couple times. 

So it was Thursday night Sk8 sesh. We're just cruising around downtown. Until like 12, we go back to campus. Had a great time with everyone. They seem like cool dudes. We go sit down on some steps near campus just to talk to each other and act retarded. 

We were being goofy as people walked by, they were yelling ""REEEEEEEE"" and I was playing a whistle with my nose. I know, retarded, but it was fun at like 1 am. So most people ignored us, but as this one chick walked by, I looked her directly in the eyes and played my best whistle as she walked by. Few minutes later, she loops back around. Talks to me-""hey, I just wanted to say, that was one of the most unusual interactions I've had with someone here.""

And we just started talking. She was like flirting with me for a solid 2 and a half hours. I got her number, she told me that we'd have to talk about stuff, and she genuinely seemed interested. 

Keep in mind 2 of my friends had left at like 1 am and my other friend stayed until I did. He didn't talk to her **near** as much as I did. 

So it was 2:30 and I had class the next day, so I just had to end it there and I just told her I'd text her and that I'd have to go home. 

But she continues walking the same direction towards where she said she lives, and so does my other friend, because I know he also lives that way. 

Fucking next day. I get out of class at 1 pm. Tired af because I didn't get much sleep last night because I was talking to this girl. 

I texted her. At 1 pm. No response. I texted again at like 10 pm. No response. Fucking ghosted/fake number. 

So I get a video message the next day of that dude that walked home with her, eating lunch at the cafeteria with her. It's fucked up. Asshole ĵust stole this girl. 

I mean, I was really feeling a connection with someone, for the first time in my life. I've never really had a girlfriend. Tinder doesn't even work for me. 

I'm just so fucking lonely. I want someone I can actually talk to, but there's no one for me. No one likes me. I'm just tired of these fucking games. 

I'm just really pissed about that dude. How much of an asshole move is that? He's a fucking goofball, too. He's like pretty autistic. No social awareness, just shouts 4-chan memes at strangers. Talks about himself all the time, doesn't understand social queues. 

I mean yeah. Now I don't know what to do. I am not like a normal person, I don't like partying, and I don't like party girls. So I don't know how to meet people. Help please. ",26Mar2017,1

37,"I was eating my breakfast this morning, in a depressed slump, trying to think of how I ended up allowing myself to be in these situations. I've been in two abusive relationships in my lifetime, both my first and second boyfriend were abusive in multiple ways. I was eating my breakfast contemplating how I ended up where I am today, and I got hit by a memory of my very first boyfriend, about 7 months into our relationship. I remember I was 16 or so at the time. My parents went out of town and left me home alone for a weekend. He was livid that they would leave me alone, and for whatever reason feared for my safety. He insisted I call my parents, and against their wishes tell them I would be staying at his house the weekend and that there was nothing they could do to stop me. My parents hated him, I knew it would ruin their vacation, in fact I knew they would turn around and come right back home and I'd be caught between my parents disapproval of my distant and horrible behavior and attitudes that I had acquired due to him constantly telling me what to do, and me fearing what may happen if I didn’t follow through with his requests. I didn't want to choose who to piss off that night. I didn't what to choose to disappoint my parents yet again and ruin their weekend. And I certainly didn't want to disobey my boyfriend at the time and face whatever consequences may have followed from him.

I had this wild idea that since my aunt lived just a few streets down, maybe I could convince him to let me stay there. My parents wouldn't mind if I stayed at my aunts, and if he didn't mind, then I wouldn't have to choose between a rock and hard place. He always made me choose between a rock and a hard place. But this one time, I had found an out. There was one problem though. My aunt had gone out of town with my parents as well and no one was home. This my boyfriend didn't know at the time and I used it to my advantage. I remember scrambling to message the few girlfriends I still had, our relationships had faded tremendously over the 7 months I had been with him. He didn't like me to have friends, and had me cut ties with a lot of them. I hadn't really talked to any of them in so many months. I had fallen off the face of the earth in their eyes. I messaged one girl in particular on Facebook, asking her to do me some big favor, followed by a script that sounded like something my aunt might say, pleading her to text me those exact lines on my cue. I had changed her contact name in my cell phone to ""Aunt Jackie"", so that it had looked like I was sending and receiving messages from my aunt, and not my old friend turned acquaintance Maggie.

I had to have some solid proof for my boyfriend that I had asked and was given permission to stay at my aunts, and this was the only way I figured I could get away with it. I remember Maggie hesitating on sending me those messages I asked her too, saying she didn't feel like it, or thought it was stupid or weird. I remember silently begging her to please just do this one thing for me, you have no idea what I have at stake right now. I remember sending her multiple messages saying please, just please do this, send this last thing and you can stop, without giving her any reason behind why I was having her do this. I found keeping quiet about all of it was easier. I don't think I would've been able to say it out loud if I tried to anyways. I wouldn't have been able to tell anyone. Once I said it out loud, it made it all real.

She texted me the script, I showed my boyfriend, silently praying inside that he would believe what I was presenting him and that everything would work out. He did. I felt a pressure lift off my shoulders in that moment, but as all moments of relief in our relationship, it didn't last long. He insisted he walk me to my aunt's house, about 4 streets over from mine. I was struck with an all too familiar ill feeling and gut wrenching anxiety. The kind that really makes your breathing uncontrollably heavy, and that makes your knees weak. But I knew better than to flinch, for if he had found out I was lying, what came after would be far far worse than what would've happened had I just refused to call my parents and stay at his house in the first place.

I nodded my head anxiously at his request to walk me. I had learned there was no point in arguing with him when he intended to do something. What he intended to do was going to happen regardless of whether or not I decided to do it the easy way or the hard way. It was in my best interest to just nod my head at his requests, no matter how outrageous or unethical. He was good and making me break my morals, even better at making me forget I had any at all. At this point I had been scrubbed of any of my own opinions, ideas, and those morals. I was stuck in his washer, and wrung dry of any fragments of my previous self.

I made a bag of overnight clothing, I had to make this believable. We began walking to my aunts, every footstep closer I felt more and more helpless. I ran through 100 different scenarios of how I was going to convince him I was truly staying at my aunt's house once we reached the front door. I wondered if he'd notice that there was no car in the driveway, no lights shining through shades in any of the windows. I hadn't known true fear until I was introduced to him. I was trembling.

When we finally arrived, we stopped at the end of her driveway. We made small light talk, me trying to conceal my shaking hands and quivering voice, and he kissed me goodbye. I walked up to the door, extremely slowly, trying to buy myself as much time as possible. I remember standing along the side of the house, waiting quietly and impatiently for him to get as far away as possible. I sat there for what felt like an eternity, jumping at every slight blow of the wind or fall of a leaf. I kept thinking he was right around the corner waiting for me to come out to bust me in my lie. I hadn't known true paranoia until I was introduced to him. When I finally pulled myself together, I peeked around the corner and the coast was clear. I ran home a rather odd and long way. A way I knew I wouldn't run into him. I got back to my house and locked the door. 

I breathed a sigh of relief that I knew would only last until tomorrow.

I sat at the kitchen table this morning, in tears, wondering why I couldn't have loved myself enough to be with a guy who I didn't feel as though I had to lie to for my own safety. Why, why, why....

44,"Talking about myself... I don't really like or need people? I feel loneliness, sometimes,  I feel like I want to be have meaningful friendships and relationships, but in reality I feel suffocated having to maintain them.

49,"I'm not religious, although the majority of my family are. I've been brought up in a liberal Christian household, grew up going to church, even briefly believed in God for a while before gradually deconverting. But the point is: I've been raised with excellent role models of Christians, and have come to respect that Christians can be loving, charitable, and generally wonderful people, with a great sense of community.

That said, I don't think I've ever gotten over the cognitive dissonance I feel when I'm in a church, or in a predominantly Christian environment. I sing in a gospel choir, and in that case, there's pretty much no dissonance. I like singing, and I don't mind if the songs are about Jesus. But I always feel a little bit weird when I go to a holiday service with my family, or attend a friend's Baptism, or attend a church service as part of a choir performance. I'm just struck by the strangeness of the fact that a large group of people within that building - and billions outside of it - honestly and fervently believe that there is a God.

I'm not here to debate religion. I've been through all of that, and it doesn't interest me, because even if I could change your mind (no one can,) I wouldn't want to. In general, believing in God seems to positively affect people's lives, and I've seen people overcome hardships and make great leaps after converting. I respect that, and I respect anyone - religious or no - who treats others with love and respect; as most of the Christians in my life do.

But I may never get over that feeling of strangeness, that a community of billions exists where people believe in an omnipotent, unknowable, and logically impossible, higher power.",26Mar2017,12

I saw a movie today and I really enjoyed it.  I thought about recommending it to my friends on social media but really, what the hell is the point?  Nobody cares.  Can anyone tell me if there is a disorder or something that makes you stop sharing yourself with people, like that specific behavior?  I don't know enough about psychology.",26Mar2017,4

Not to mention all of the new subreddits that keep popping up that nobody cares about apart from angry SJWs and people that just really don't like Trump.

60,"I don't know exactly when this happened, cause I didn't feel any pain or anything at all, but the thing is my ball is not in the scrotum. I know it's a thing for it to go up and stay there for a while but its been good few days and Im certain it's stuck. I ejaculate normally and do everything involving my balls without any problem (that I could detect). I don't fill any pain whatsoever. I can barely see it there (I have quite low %fat), at about the height of where the public hair starts. I can touch it and move it around a bit, but as much as I've tried, I can't possibly get it to actually go down to the scrotum. I want to add this had never ever happened to me and I didn't have undescended testicles as a baby.

I would really appreciate if someone could help me fix it rather than going to the doctor, because I'm not yet an adult and I don't really want to involve my parents. Thanks a lot in advance.",26Mar2017,2
