2,"I was sexually abused, raped, whatever you call it, a couple years ago. It was in 2012, maybe 2011.  I have very few memories of  that entire part of my life (those couple of years in general).

I'm 18 now, so I must have been 13 or 12 when it happened. I had never told anyone in person about it, ever. I'm lucky for it not to have affected me, I don't remember it most of the time.

Hell, I just remembered right now that actually _two_ teachers _fiddled_ with me, and not just the one that I remember semi vividly.

Anyway, I'm a guy, and I have just finished my first semester of university. I met a great -- a really great -- woman, and we're sort of in a relationship now. First kiss... First dates... second base... third base but not the full shebang... worries... first new years kiss for both of us.

But then I became super worried (""worries""). Over the years at random points I thought ""maybe I should get tested, just in case?"".  Now I had to get tested. For her sake especially.

I was super irresponsible for not getting tested earlier on -- I never really had the push to -- but now I'm actively extra irresponsible for exposing someone else to this.

I hate myself for not being the responsible one and doing it before we got to the stage we did. But we didn't go the full shebang, there was still exposure to her, but we haven't done the killer deed.

So I went and booked an appointment. I spoke to the woman about it for the first time, she didn't talk about the abuse much, if at all. 

A couple days later, when we were in bed, somehow some STD topic came up in bed, and she was like ""don't worry I'm clean"". I chuckled nervously for a second.

She continued like ""I'd like to know if you were too if there were others"" (this sounds ever so slightly mean typing it out, but she was saying it very innocently, I sometimes mention how she's my first everything... first person I've ever sung to, etc.)

A few days later was my test. I spoke to someone in person for the first time PROPERLY about things (in real life). I was semi-detailed, and she told me the chances of infection were extremely low. Phew, my suspicions were correct.

I called up for the results a few days later just to see what the format is. Once you've entered your details you have this super slow robotic ladylike voice saying:

&gt; * Chlamydia throat test: no results back
&gt; * Chlamydia rectum test: no results back
&gt; * Chlamydia urine test: no results back
&gt; * Gonnorhea throat test: no results back
&gt; * Gonnorhea rectum test: no results back
&gt; * Gonnorhea urine test: no results back
&gt; * Hepatitis B test : no results back
&gt; * HIV test : no results back
&gt; * Syphillis test : no results back

Okay, so I guess I can't just keep calling every day like my original plan was.  And it's too nervous. ""OKAY IT'S NEGATIVE, WHAT ABOUT THIS?"". Can't handle that shit everyday.

I was patient. It found its way on my mind every couple of days, but I was okay. I kept myself occupied.

Today I called up.

&gt; * Chlamydia throat test: negative
&gt; * Chlamydia rectum test: negative
&gt; * Chlamydia urine test: negative
&gt; * Gonnorhea throat test: negative
&gt; * Gonnorhea rectum test: negative
&gt; * Gonnorhea urine test: negative
&gt; * Hepatitis B test : negative
&gt; * HIV test : negative
&gt; * Syphillis test : negative

I shook after each line. Will this also be negative? And when it was done.

Just a big smile. Just a big fucking smile. And excessive panting.

My irresponsibility for not getting tested earlier did not bite severely in the arse. I'm clean.

Now I can just enjoy this new relationship, wherever and however it goes. &lt;3",05Jan2017,604
4,"Okay when I asked for an eventful 2016 I wasn't expecting to fall for a homeless man (like, who does that???), move INTO his tent, become engaged to him with a bubblegum ring, And have a kinda mean baby on the way that started punching me at 10 weeks.
Yes, all in one year.
I was busy.
Now he's always on my ass about us working, and he's so stressed about us getting a place by July 4th (Baby's due date) so nobodeh takes our bebeh.
Now I totally get that, but i'm the pregnant lady. I do not look like a pale caramel marshmallow yet but, it's happening INSIDE then OUT.
For example: he's kinda upset I quit my job at Macy's when I didn't look pregnant. But I was awful. like a woman on her period times 10, without Netflix and ice cream, awful. And dealing with stupid frustrating customers everyday wasn't gonna work.
I am honestly surprised that I didn't end up in prison.

I do want to work, but that one and a half month of me seemingly ""laxing it up"" upsets him now that we really need to bust our asses and get shit done. Because simply put, it was something that could already be on it's way off the checklist
And i'm ready to do that, it's just as much my kid as it is his.
He doesn't understand the ""computer and phone stuff"" I've been doing, appointments, phone calls, applying for jobs ONLINE, and also looking for more office jobs. (He's more old school and prefers talking to people face to face and doesn't understand non-physical work)

My parents are pretty much aliens on another planet. (Religion and race. it doesn't help that my fianc√©e is not Muslim and is as white as a saltine cracker. My extended family help when they can, but there's only so much they can do.

I think that was me venting.

Want to give a shoutout to people that responded to my posts, I know they'll probably not see it, but I'll feel better having done this, (but not actually PM them) ha.

I don't know, it sucks that a huge chunk of my time will be gone but I'm also not going to be scrambling for freelance clients/contracts.

I'm liking the idea of ""Free time"" I can choose to pursue something that interests me.

I'll be stuck for a while, I've got a 5 digit debt to repay even if I made some successful Saas or web applications, it'll be a while, better get comfortable.

I'm just grateful I have friends, sucks when money is involved like ""Well I was hired, but I need a uniform.""

Today I was like ""What motivates these people to help me?""

But you know it's part of that ""belonging"" thing, like you enjoy each other's company (hopefully) and when a person is down you can empathize/try to help and then both parties feel better. I don't know.

If I ever make it, I want to help others. (I can now, go to a soup kitchen)

8,"There's some subs that I've unsubscribed from because the comments on each thread are so negative - for example, /r/lifeprotips, which used to be good until every thread became ""This is a terrible idea"" and ""No, here's the real LPT..."". Now I'm finding it difficult to enjoy /r/jokes for a similar reason: reposts. And it's not the reposts themselves that bother me, it's the people that complain about reposts.

The thing is, I'm not a long time subscriber or /r/jokes, and maybe if I was, I'd feel the same way, but almost every joke I see on there is new to me, and plenty are funny. Why do I give a shit if it's unoriginal? All humour is derivative in some way, and some jokes are going to be recycled; it's a mark of a good one that it gets passed on. And even if you have seen it before, so what? You hear the same joke more than once and your blood pressure goes through the roof and you need to be sedated?

Reposts are fine. Unoriginal ideas are fine. In a popular sub, everything will have been said before, at some point, and it takes a long memory or an active search to be aware that something has been said before. But so long as credit is being given where due, your complaining about reposts makes the sub much worse for me than the repost ever did.",05Jan2017,12

11,"I'm in high school. I'm a junior year student taking 3 AP classes by choice because I thought I could handle it.

Turns out, ever since October, school makes me really, really upset. I can't handle this anymore. I am held to such a high standard that there's only so much I can do until I crack again. Every time I make a mistake, I get really **really** upset. When I was a child, I was always expected the best out of, but that all turned once I entered high school.

I'm failing two classes now, AP Chemistry and CP Precalculus. My grades in AP USH and AP Lang are dropping because of this constant self loathing I feel each time I get my papers that I tried busting my ass on but end up getting 67%s. I can't raise my grade in Precalculus anymore because every single day, I'm burned out by the time I reach that period because it's my final period of the day. There's been days now where I've thought ""If I kill myself, I probably won't have to deal with this"". I know every single thing for precalculus because I took essentially the same class during summer, but test anxiety gets the best of me. Chemistry fucks me up, because I overthink it when I'm not supposed to, which is ironic because in English, I'm burned out to shit by that time of day that analyze text like a fucking moron.

I always get so hungry during school, and I can only eat afterschool. My lunch form for free, shitty school food got messed up somehow, so I'm ended up having to hold it out for 6 hours. Even then, the food is so expensive outside school, but I'd rather pay for outside food than I would $3 for a shitty processed spaghetti ""bowl"" or a salty chicken sandwich.

I am not a science person, as it seems. I fooled myself thinking ""Huh, I want to take engineering as a career"" even though I probably have a D+ in both AP Chemistry and Precalc now because of the amount of stress that's put onto me.

I don't even want to go university! The only fucking reasons I'm taking these classes is because the standard college prep courses are so fucking easy, and in a lot of cp classes, there's nothing to do, and boredom fucks me up. Besides, the only reason I'm applying is because I'm expected to.

I don't know what to do anymore. Finals are getting closer and closer, and my sanity is quickly running away. My only way to vent my stress is through reddit, and the same old routine of me coming home at roughly 4:00 PM, throwing my headphones on, and listening to Radiohead and Nirvana and Green Day albums from top to bottom. I have a good number of friends, but they have their own problems, and I don't need to become a burden upon them.

There's so much going off in my head right now, it's ridiculous. I didn't even write this wall of text in order.

To top this all off, I don't even know what I want to do with my life. I don't want to go to university, but at the same time, I want financial stability, since that's my real life goal. Whatever.

12,"I've been on reddit for almost 7 years total. I find myself wasting my time here throughout the day at work, and again at home, wherever. It's not hard to do. Work slow? Open reddit. Tired and laying in bed? Why not see what's on reddit? 

It's unhealthy, but I think what's even more unhealthy is how I continue to read the site when a lot of times all I see anymore is hatred, arguing, anger... And I partake in that. Way, way more now than I ever have before in my time on reddit. And I know it affects me emotionally, too. Not in overtly observable ways, but subtly. Some days after a day if bad arguments on reddit, or reading the news or comment sections in general for depressing stories or posts, even without saying anything in their comments, I can come out of it feeling pretty blue and I don't even know why. Lately I've felt especially pessimistic and generally just a plain, vanilla feeling of sadness, sometimes for no apparent reason, after reading a bit of reddit.

The thing is, I actually don't know how else I would occupy my ""empty"" time -  the periods of time where I'm actually not doing anything and have nothing to satisfy my short attention span with. I think the longest I've ever gone on reddit without posting anything was about one week exactly. I was actually actively trying to avoid the site, but I don't really know how I managed to do it. And here's what's pathetic; I used to consider myself a gamer at one point, but nowadays I probably don't even put in more than 4 hours a week maximum into gaming, and yet I have so many thing I want to play, but I can't bring myself to do it - yet I have no problem continuing to browse reddit. 


All in all, I just don't really know what to do, how to scale back the time I spend on this site. Even when I have, I feel like there are interesting conversations or videos or stories happening that I'm not seeing and will miss out on, and I can't bring myself to exerting enough self-control to finding other things to occupy my time with, especially when I'm not sure *what* to occupy my time with - when I am browsing the Internet in general, at least.",05Jan2017,7

Two days ago I came home from the grocery store, put my purse on the kitchen chair, took my keys and my phone out of it, and put the groceries away. Yesterday I was getting ready to go to an appointment and went to grab my purse, but it was gone. Texted my friend, she said that she hadn't seen it around, but that I could search through her room if I wanted to check everywhere. It's been more than 24 hours and I've searched the entire apartment at least 3 times, to no avail.

16,"Here's what the people need to do:

Step 1: Abandon mainstream media.  CNN, Fox, Breitbart (split hairs on whether that's mainstream or not, idgaf. Either breitbart is the 'spearhead of the alt-right', or it's nothing to worry about. It can't be both) , MSNBC, Salon, NYT, WP, etc. They're all farming clicks. Their job is to generate outrage for money.  It's their job to get YOU to CLICK on their articles and consume advertisements. It's not news. It's a business. Extremely dangerous narratives used to generate outrage for ad money results in the shit that's on /r/news right now (Which prompted this post).  Division generates ad revenue. Outrage generates ad revenue. Fear generates ad revenue. This system has got to stop.  Throw it all out. It's over. They've lost our trust.


Step 2: Aggressively support grassroot campaigns. Pick -one-, and support it as HARD AS YOU CAN.  Whether it's the progressive party, libertarian party, or the green party (or whatever! I'm a scholar, I have not settled on a political party).  The two party system MUST be abolished.  The democrats and republicans have not represented the people's will for decades now.  It is a scheme to generate political power in order to sell it.  

Modern politics is a business.  You accumulate power to sell it off as favors to corporations.  Since this is lucrative, and legal, everyone does it, and if you don't do it, you are outnumbered and over powered by those who do. It's systemic.

Step 3: Engage in a 'cyber riot' by flooding data-collectors with false information. Ruin data collection as a lucrative business by forcing them to analyze the data they receive. Make it useless so that it is no longer lucrative to collect and store it anymore.

Step 4:  Delegitimize FIAT currency. Either return to gold standard, or rely on cryptocurrency. This will probably happen when the bubble-chain depression hits in about a decade, but we can get ahead of this thing BEFORE that happens (When the student loan bubble reaches its peak, students wont be able to afford college, which means no more fresh talent for San Francisco/Seattle tech industry, which means no one can afford to buy multi-million dollars single bedroom apartments, which means the west coast housing market collapses, which means the tech industry collapses, and then the rest of the country with it). If the dollar tanks, Bitcoin won't. It is independent to the dollar. Want to survive a recession or depression? Convert to bitcoin or convert to gold/silver.  Do it -now- while you still can.

We take care of these things, everything else we want will fall into place. Renewable energy, term limits, loan bubbles, first past the post voting, two party system, healthcare all of it will fall into place.

You can't make the changes you want in the world with emergent systems pulling with the strength of a billion unconscious actions against it.

It's not the malicious acts of a few preventing these things, it's sociopathic systems spearheading towards profit 100% of the time, 24/7.   One person making a small decision for their wallet = a million people doing that thinking they're just one person.  This is a system that is spiraling out of control.  It *will* crash and burn, and unless we stop it now, it will take you, your dreams, and your family's well being with it.


Step 1 is now: Abandon mainstream media.  Even if that means you don't get news for a while. A message MUST be sent.

21,"Hi all! Apologies if this isn't the right subreddit, but I have seen all the support and advice given around this sub, and I figured somebody could relate to at least some of what I've been feeling. I'm 24 years old, graduated college with a Film &amp; Media Studies degree, and am currently living in SoCal feeling hopeless and just completely lost in many aspects of my life. I've been dating my current girlfriend who I also just signed a lease on an apartment with a few months ago for about 4 years. I love and care for her very much but she has a full time job while I'm working part time, along with looking for employment that is not only somewhat relevant to what I want to pursue as a career. I know couples argue but lately we have been having arguments almost every other day, and the pettiest things seem to be snowballing and leading to fights about the same things. We have both acknowledged that we are working on things but we are finding it easier said than done. We still manage to make the same mistakes, and fight. She also has so many redeeming qualities. She is more thoughtful than I am, is better at staying on top of things, and can be one of the most wonderful people I've been around. However, I t's hard to admit that the person you thought you'd spend the rest of your life with may in fact not be the right person, even if you love them. We just expect different things from one another but we are both having trouble facing it head on and convince ourselves we can fix ourselves and mesh the way we did the first couple years of the relationship. It's not only the relationship stress (stuck in the lease, income isn't spectacular, etc) but the frustration of not finding a job. I wish I had done more in college, I had done some radio broadcasting for sports which I really enjoyed and is the closest thing to a passion I've had but finding a career in that field is very difficult if you aren't a former athlete or don't possess a ton of experience. I watched La La Land the other day, and it really triggered me to think about my dreams and how to get as close to turning them into a reality as possible, along with honing in and identifying what I am passionate about. The closest thing I have to that is wanting to work in sports in any capacity. Along with experience and being a former athlete, it also really comes down to who you know and I've always prided myself on my networking skills but nothing has stuck and it has really decreased my motivation. I find myself kicking myself for not doing more in college to make myself stick out. The frustration of not being able to find a full-time job, being forced to be ridiculously frugal, along with the struggles in my relationship are just taking a toll on my emotional well being. I've always been an outgoing, social, optimistic guy, and I still feel that way a lot of the time but I find myself in a negative state of mind far more often than I ever had in the past. I'm not sure if it's just coming from the stress of being an adult or if it is that on top of being in an unhealthy relationship, and practicing bad habits. I find myself stuck in this loop of lacking motivation lately (which I'm aware is totally counter productive to what I'm trying to accomplish) when it comes to not only finding employment, but also being a better boyfriend. My girlfriend is a naturally negative person and that has always bothered me but I also realize I don't do many thoughtful things to motivate her to be more positive. It's tough knowing what you're doing wrong, yet still finding yourself making the same mistake. You can't blame anyone else, you know it's your own fault. It's also tough being in a relationship where we both don't treat each other the way we deserve. I love so many things about her and I think that's why it's particularly tough to let go. She is my first love (I had only had small flings before her) and so much of my favorite years and memories involve her so letting her go would almost feel like letting those memories go. I don't even know if we should continue to work on the relationship and if it will get better once I find a way to motivate myself and get a job. I have applied rigorously and have attended interviews with no luck so far but my lack of motivation really applies to me not doing anything extra to make myself stick out from other applicants. I don't know if I need a fresh start or if I need to work on being a better boyfriend and hoping that motivates my girlfriend to be more positive and hopefully that means less fighting. Getting a fresh start would be tough when I'm locked into a lease and I don't hate her. I still love her, but just don't know if I should admit that I'm perhaps not in the right stage of my life to be in a relationship. I should also note that she had pushed me since college to do extra curricular things and i just never followed through on some of it which I know is my fault. The problem is she also has no control when something makes her upset or anxious, regardless of how small the issue is or what it's about, it tends to be taken out on me and no matter how sincerely I've apologized for something, a past mistake of mine always gets thrown back in my face as if my apology meant nothing.  I just feel overwhelmed at times juggling so much. I'm sorry I wasn't able to organize this rant into something more coherent, I just really needed to get some stuff of my chest and hopefully get some input. I'll be happy to elaborate on anything that isn't clear or other info that might be relevant. Thanks for taking the time to read this. ",05Jan2017,6

33,"So I moved back to the UK after stuydying in France for 8 years, (16 years old doing GCSEs) still fluent in English so wasn't hard to make friends. I went to an all boys catholic school when I arrived in the UK which was a cutural shock to me from being in a mixed school for my entire educational life. A year and a half has passed since then and I've made some good friends, I'm usually acquainted with everyone and guard a small group of friends. The fact is, is that when I moved back to the UK I had to leave my girlfriend in France, I became a total emotional wreck and was pining constantly, and this one friend, John, was there for me. We play daily videogames on Steam and are constantly on Teamspeak 24/7. Well since this October I think I've fallen in love with him and I've been straight my entire life, I simply brushed it off as just ""brotherly"" love because he means to much to me, but he started to do ""gayish"" things with another friend which was just banter as it was an all boys school, but I got ragely jealous, like a jealously I've never felt before, adrenaline pumping jealously and then I realised that I loved him... I couldn't accept the fact that I had these homosexual feelings towards someone. I've been a hardcore homophobic person all my life anyway. We stay up until 6am, do all nighters playing games together, he says stuff sometimes which makes me uncomfortable like ""f*ck me daddy"" or generally speaking sex type moans, I don't mind it but I can't help but think he does it for a reasob. The only classes I sit next to him in is maths and in my opinion he's quite flirty, constantly leans on me and just general weird sexual movements, which then again makes me uncomfortable. But however it's gotten to a point to where I'm thinking about him 24/7 and I just can't stop. I don't like any other guys it's just him and his personality, he's a confusing person and never wants to do anything social. I just don't understand anymore and it's getting to a point that it's ruining me inside having to hide my emotions. I'm scared to tell him face to face because I cherish our friendship more than anything. He browses Reddit alot so if you see this, I hope you can forgive me... I don't want to feel this way but I can't help it anymore, it's literally killing me inside as a person.

TL;DR Love my best friend but too scared to admit it. If you see this John read what I wrote, I want to tell you this face to face but don't have the guts and don't want to ruin our friendship because it means alot to me...

I know that what I'm doing right now is a representation of my entire life for the next couple of decades, and this has given me the impression that in reality, all this hard work is meaningless as we are all going to die at one point and lose everything that we have ever accomplished. Can anyone please help me to appropriately dismantle this mentality? I want to have good moments and live my life but nothing also really satisfies me recently.",05Jan2017,3
41,"I want to know how many people can remember these historical ""facts"" from a most excellent history report.

Beethoven liked Bon Jovi's slippery when wet

Joan of Arc created the first aerobics program for her troops

Genghis Khan could trash a sporting goods store in under 10 mins

Siegmund Freud liked ladies to call him ""Siggy""

Socrates liked billiards

And Napoleon couldn't bowl for shit

42,"Or to ask another way: 

* ***What's with this weird concealment of GENETICS as a cause for obesity?*** 

Two examples: 

* Friend A has never once in his life watched his calory intake, eats tons of candies, chips, pastry, savory dishes, etc., and has always been skinny AF. Not going to the gym or anything. 

* Friend B cannot watch an ice cream commercial without putting on weight, and has been battling her weight problems with an empty stomach ever since she hit puberty. Regular gym, morning jogging, aerobics. 

And those are just two examples within MANY I know personally. 

So what's up with that? 

***Obviously*** the lifestyle has VERY limited impact on both friends' weight. So what is it? Strongly suggests genetics, doesn't it? 

Yet, whenever the topic is touched upon in the media, genetics (or other such conspicuous dispositions) are pretty much NEVER EVER even mentioned. Not even as a side note. 

It's always limited to: 'Hey guys! Just watch your darn calories and go to the gym, alright? It's that simple. Ya f4t b4st4ards.'

50,"Well I made a post here a couple days ago about being kicked out of my parents house soon. It's going to happen this weekend, it's when my dad wants my report card and when he sees it I'm going to be kicked out. I think tonight or tomorrow after work I'll clean my car and get my things in order. I don't have much to my name, I've got 200 dollars in my bank account and I remembered a couple days ago I think I have 1k-2k in bond money. I'll use that money to pay off my bills I currently own and throw the rest in savings. Other then that all I have to my name is some good electronics, like my phone, 2 decent laptops, and my really expensive computer. I might sell one of the laptops but in the long run I don't want to start selling any of my belongings, that's why I've decided to live out of my car for awhile. It's not much but its spacey, it's a 1990 Oldsmobile, so I'm hoping I can fit my stuff in there and if not I hope my friends or my girlfriend will hang onto some stuff for me. I've been offered to stay at my girlfriends parents house but I don't want them to see me as a burden nor do I want the help to begin with. I also don't want anyone to see me homeless. I hold my pride tight and this will be a low blow to myself but I'm very optimistic. I was given good advice from my last post and I'd like to say thank you to those people. My other option I was thinking is moving up north to where my girlfriend and some friends both go to school, my friends rent out a house so I was thinking I might split rent and live in the living room and find a full time job up there. But the only problem with that is that I still love my family and friends back in my hometown. Even though my dad is going to kick me out all I want in the world is him to be proud of me, and the part that hurts me the most of this whole situation is that I love him so much and I'm so afraid he won't love me or be proud of me. To me family is everything and all I want is for him to be proud of me and what I've done. Every Friday and Saturday we invite our extended family over for dinner, and I hope that I leave on good enough terms to were I'm invited to those dinners every week. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I just needed to get it off my chest. Thank you.",05Jan2017,5
51,"I'm not sure whether to lament the fact that reddit has largely become a narrative driven website or to go on an ""I told you so"" rant about how trying to control said narrative drives people towards the alt-right. I know that no one is clamoring to hear my opinion about the Chicago kidnapping story, but the only places that are talking about it where I'm allowed to post are /r/uncensorednews and voat. I don't mean this as an indictment on on the /r/news mod team but they're the default new subreddit and they're not allowing discussion on the news... Am I crazy or is this ridiculous? 

As an aside, I've never gone to a thread and said to myself ""oh, thank goodness they locked this thread."" Thread locking seems to be a feature that encourages lazy moderation. In the past the mod teams would have brought on new moderators once the treads got too busy to effectively moderate but now they can just prevent any need for moderation at all. If the conversation goes a direction they don't like, they can just lock the thread and say it was for some altruistic reason. It seems to me that the thread locking tool is too heavily abused and it's gotten to the point that it is affecting reddit on a whole in a very negative way. ",05Jan2017,0

when I applied, the job description stated you had to have a driver's license. I thought it was a little weird, as the job doesn't seem to require a car. 

So I lied. Everyone lies on those things right? I've been trying to get my driver's license but my interview is scheduled before I'll be able to. 

I just don't know what to do. Do I tell the truth? Keep the lie up and try to rush job taking the test? What if I fail? I recognize this is all my own fault, I shouldn't have lied. Anyone been in a similar position? What did you do/what happened?

57,"I work at a private kindergarten.
(M22)
Recently I've been trying to get into school by applying for financial aid.
Anyways, a few days ago I asked if I could leave 10 minutes early to go and pick up a a car part before the place closes.

My boss is unsure of letting me do just that, because there would be too many kids with her at that time.
I was so fed up, and told her I thought it was unfair that all the full time teachers get to do their thing, vacation, get off early for whatever reason WITHOUT QUESTION.
She comes back with, because they give me two weeks notice, and I'm not gonna argue about this.
Okay seems fair.

I told her I couldn't even get a day off to go turn my forms in for financial aid, even if I tell her well beyond two weeks notice.
""Well I haven't seen a two week notice form for your day off on my desk and I told you to fill one out""
The argument ends there.
Now there are two reasons I think I've been treated unfairly.

1. I was discouraged to fill out this form because my boss told me there aren't really any good days to have off, and that there's no one to cover me, when I first asked her for a day off, and that I should fill a form out...seriously.

2. A while back my co-worker went through a divorce, next thing you know they gave her the next day off and dumped her class on me...this isn't the bad part, I was empathetic and took her class.
The day came when something tragic happened to me, and my friend died, and a memorial was being held for her, not only could I not get the day off, but I couldn't even stay for the entire memorial, not a half day, just two fucking hours.

Right now my co-worker asked to leave ten minutes early for lunch, my boss moved things around and I need take my lunch early.
I'm open minded so I'm open to the idea that I might be over analyzing.
And I'm coming back to work 3-4 minutes late to state that I'm not going to reliable.

62,"Gonna sum up this story, hoping that this is the place to do it.

So for a couple months this really beautiful girl has had a thing for me, on Christmas she made out with me quite a bit drunk and then on New Years she convinced me to come visit her at a party and then sat on me until midnight so I'd stay and be her NYE kiss and then asked me out on a date. So I like her, don't get me wrong, she's wonderful and genuinely so sweet, but I'd already sort of grown close to someone and that night ended up telling him I loved him and he told me the same.

Both of us had committed to things with people though and despite how close we are we both went to those things, I came out even more confused but with this girl still flirting with me and still so, so interested, and he came out in a relationship. Cue tears.

Anyway the closeness was still there but we kinda had to stop and a lot of it was hurting me so I tried to take a break, which upset him quite a bit too and in the end it didn't work out and we both decided to stay single in order to figure out our shit. Which was when he started getting weird about commitment and how he wasn't going to judge me if I got with this girl as long as he didn't hear about it and basically shit that seemed really dodge and loopholey. I've played that game before, I've been used and abused and I'm sick of it and I'm honestly not letting him do that, even though he doesn't know it. I'm basically just gonna disappear until it (it being the normality of our being friends/talking) goes away. But I'm so fucking sore and tired and I really care about him and want him in my life I'm just exhausted of the crap that keeps coming my way and being used and lied to. In this case I don't even have right, honestly, he's not my boyfriend and his business isn't mine, but the potential for very obvious bullshittery wasn't fucking fun and I find myself hurt and unsure of what to do.

This post was supposed to be about tomorrow and an event I'm going to where this girl is going to try and get with me again and what to do about that, aside from the original plan to bring him with which is now off, but honestly I'm just going to go with it, tell her the truth and hope for the best.

The hardest part is that this person means so much to me. I miss him, I worry about him, I want to be with him so much, I care about him and love him and I don't think he doesn't feel the same, I really don't want to lose him but I also really, really need to draw a line when it comes to people in my life and how they treat me. Explaining that to him isn't something I want to do though. I'm trying so hard no to feel distraught over this person I love but also to protect myself and I'm just sick of it. I'm sick of crap happening and I don't know what to do.

I have to reactivate facebook soon, I'm not sure if I should just ignore him or tell him I want another break at this point. But I don't want to fuck around with that either.",05Jan2017,3
