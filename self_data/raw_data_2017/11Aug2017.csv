1,"There's so much in my life that I can't remember. Like never enough to hinder me in academics or my career, but just maybe in life. It's crazy to me how people can store emotions as memories. I feel that they are such complex entities with a million moving pieces that are stuck in the moment. Remembering the year good old Christopher landed in the Americas is one thing; it's just one number, but how do people possibly remembering how they felt 10 years ago?

So many things happen and go. I don't even know what it was like to be with my first girlfriend. ",11Aug2017,1
2,"Usually the only thing that gets me through classes is having peoppe to talk/relate to during the class. This year, there are maybe 2 people I know in each class but I don't really know or talk to them and I don't want to talk to them. I'm the type of dude who isn't worried about the extra stuff like class president and clubs and stuff like that and just want time to go faster so I can get back to freedom. Without people I know in these classes it's going to be a bad year for me.",11Aug2017,1

4,"I keep writing and re-writing this post just because I don't know how to express all of my feelings. This stuff has been on my mind a lot recently and I just want somewhere to put it....


You two presented yourself as my guardian, my advocate and told me you wanted the best for me in life and that family was everything. But you neglected me, you abused me, you financially abused me, you taught me bullshit religious conspiracies while homeschooling me and the moment I try to be independent in the slightest you become abusive, controlling and legitimately unhinged. And the worst part is all of this behavior has rubbed off on me. I'm going to keep therapists employed for years to come as I continue to fix myself. 


I don't hate you, I just don't care about you anymore. When you call I feel a weight in my chest and let it go to voicemail, then I delete the voicemail and suddenly I'm better. I realize now family is what you make it and you aren't my family and I don't owe you anything. We've never actually been very close so you may not realize I've cut out until maybe Christmas, but well I am far enough and financial independent so go ahead and try something. I'm not a kid anymore, I'm a little bigger and a little smarter and I'm almost aching for round 2. 


And while I'm laying this stuff out. I'm actually bi (like to xdress), an atheist and I smoke weed on the daily. Conservatives/Christians are sometimes good people but my folks are not. Thanks for letting me write this out to process it a little more. ",11Aug2017,12

I've been aggressively single for nearly a decade. I didn't seek out her and she certainly didn't seek out me. There's no reason that I should be this lucky but here I am.

6,"Books are still out there and I know blogs are an option, but I wish I could vent without fear.  I wish I could throw my vent out there without feedback, like books back in the 1900s.  Sure they got feedback but not immediately.  I know if I vent about what is upsetting me right now, I'd be over it by tomorrow, reading about people's comments about how I can change myself and my life. 

Overall, I'm generally happy with my life but I'm finding that as I change as a person, I can't help but wonder how much of my internal behavior is due to a lack of resources.

I know I'm being very vague about my rant, and it's nothing law related.  Just me trying to figure out how to be the best self for me.  I'm making zero sense.  Shit.  Idk.  I guess I miss personal one on one talks, being able to vent to a single person.  I guess, as vague and detailed as I can get, I miss having friends I can rely on.

7,"I'm a senior in college and I haven't made any friends at all. I have attended both community college and university and the furthest I've gotten was being somewhat talkative with my lab partners but for some reason I've never made a friend. I don't know if I come across as weird, boring, unapproachable, etc.
I've been in classes where a group of people sit at a table and everyone is talking to each other and they all become friends by the end of the semester and I am the only quiet person on that table.

It seems silly and vain, but it's really unnerving to have a part of you that is so visible to the world get all fucked up. It's strange to watch your body just take the reigns and self-destruct (okay, a little melodramatic) and there's nothing you can do about it. 

People find the patches startling and I honestly don't know if anyone will consider dating me while it's like this. I want to be all zen and detached from my ego, but I really just feel afraid and embarrassed about how my head might look if it gets worse. I'm female and I would really rather not shave my head.

Alpha particles are quantum particles.  Therefore the device in the box has literally both detected and not detected it.  The cat is literally both not injected and injected with poison.  It is literally both alive and dead.  While the box is still closed.

13,"I'm 18 male, and graduated highschool this year. I always had a dream of being an animator or, just drawing the world around me. I graduated and now here I am...

Lost.

I had plans and ideas, on how I can afford to go to University. Thoughts of traveling, and seeing the world and drawing... but here I am confused, afraid, and running out of time. I'm getting kicked out as soon as my family moves which is late Sept. I have a business that I've been educating myself to start, and my entire future rest on if I can get it off the ground. The fear of failure, and knowing what I'm doing stresses me out. I go out and walk my dog, and wonder, just what am I even doing? Can I even do this? 

The people around me tell me I'm a mess, a nuisance, a fool, a slob, a glutton, and that I do nothing. I don't listen, because as soon as I succeed,  I'll be the one laughing... I say that to myself, but in reality I'm scared, and angry, not at the people around me, but myself. I'm not depressed, but I'm not happy either.

I'm surround in a room full of trash, and dust, that smells, and I sit on my bed focusing on my notes, studying, and then procrastination kicks in. I wasted the last 3 days not focusing on my work staying up late watching youtube videoes that could've waited. I'm a mess and the clocks ticking down, I have to put my business in motion, but I'm stressing over having to talk to attorneys and contractors, and other business people. I worry they'll judge me on my age, and more. I dont have a license, let alone a car. If I fail I could lose everything, and be on the streets. I feel like i'm balancing a tightrope, and everything I want is on the other side, but I have to get there. I'm obese, a slob, and surrounded by mess, but I HAVE to make this work to change myself, I HAVE to push myself up, because nobody around me will.

I didn't write this for pity, I just needed to release the thought going through my mind. I'm still stressed out and scared, but it's a matter of starting, and not starting.",11Aug2017,1
15,"Or womanchild for that matter.  
I was reading a thread over in r/relationships and it was about how the boyfriend didn't cleaned properly and didn't feed the pets correctly. I don't have pets, but I do not clean correctly it seems. I often look around my home and just think to myself, what a mess my house is. I seem to be unable to do simple chores right. Or even feed myself for that matter?? I don't even eat enough, I feel horrible in this situation and I don't want to be a child. I want to be a proper functioning adult. But I often find myself too lazy or too late (in the morning) to even make food for myself. So I often buy out, and it honestly is dragging me down. Recently I just saw how much inactuansoent of ""fast food"". Fucking hell, why am I like this??  
And whenever it *is* clean I think to myself ""when I used this, I'll put it back"" or ""after ibate/cooked, I'll clean the dishes that I used"" but I just see how it accumulates and I'm sick of it.  
Right after reading the thread I got up and wiped the table... I'll make myself a sandwich now, before I have to go. :/",11Aug2017,2
16,"People react absurdly to this and I just don't know how to explain it.  
Whether it is Game of Thrones, Rick and Morty, Breaking Bad, The Flash kindly go fuck yourself. I just do not have the patience of watching TV shows, but I am a huge movie nerd. I like movies, they explain a long story in a short and most efficient way possible refreshing you and giving you an escape from reality for a few hours. But TV shows, they just keep going on and you are constantly involved in those which is very distracting. 

I do love watching sports and comedy/news documentaries but eh TV shows.    

It is not just about TV, I am talking about Netflix stuff too. 

I do not like limiting myself, I love experiencing many things but I just cannot sit down and watch a TV show. I may watch clips on YouTube but in the end my preference wont change.      

But you know what is weird? I have infinite patience for books, and studying things. I think the reason is that I can use my own imagination in books? Rather than dumb down watching a show which kind of lays everything out to you... But I just do not know why...

20,"I work in travel management and we are receiving many complaints from corporate and personal travelers who do not research the differences between these services.

American Main Cabin Extra (MCE), Delta Comfort Plus (Comfort+), United Economy Plus (Economy+) are economy cabin seats with some enhancements, they are not comparable to true premium economy service from airlines such as BA or Lufthansa.

In the last year we have seen several corporations convert from Premium Economy services on European airlines to Economy Plus on American airlines based on ""better pricing"". This is a downgrade. These services are not equal, American MCE can't compare to BA World Traveller Plus, United EconomyPlus can't compare to Lufthansa Premium Economy.

Unfortunately, this is catching out many unfamiliar corporate travellers who are not aware these Economy Plus seats are vastly inferior with much reduced leg room and seat width as well as regular Economy food and drink.

If you do have any say in choosing between these services or influencing your corporate travel agreements, please compare products directly rather than assuming equivalence from names.

Although I always remind any personal travelers I am looking after, not all agents are doing this as our commission is fee and not based on price, so personal travelers used to European standards are also being disappointed after flying the American choices.",11Aug2017,3

22,"As of a couple of months ago, I'm now out of education for the first time in my life. I thought this would be a good thing, but I just feel lost and confused. I'm 21 and have no idea what I'm supposed to do now.

I moved fairly far to go to uni, but the one thing I always told myself is that I'd never move back in with my parents afterwards. Nothing against them of course, there's just nothing else in my home town for me. It's a little tourist town with no IT industry, there aren't any good jobs for me there and commuting outside of it is a pain, it's so far out of the way of everything.

Not to mention, all my friends from my home town have either moved away or have all fallen out since I was last home. I literally have no more friends there to even hang out with or talk to.

My original plan was to get a house with some uni friends while I work at a pub and look for something better. Unfortunately, I just split with someone who I was very close to (not officially a SO - but pretty much was, long story). This hurt me a lot, and I've decided it's best for my mental health to move away so I can stop seeing them until I'm over it.

So now I'm just at a loss for what to do. I'm moving back in with my parents next week, but I'm dreading it. My friends keep telling me to just move somewhere else and get a job there, but I just can't see myself doing that. I don't like the idea of living alone, especially if I don't even have friends in that area. They say I'll make friends - what if I don't?

It feels like everyone has some kind of plan for after uni... I've got nothing.",11Aug2017,24

31,"Last night I called my restaurant at around 10:30 because I was vomiting profusely. I spoke to the manager, the conversation went as follows:

Me: hi this is ""me"" I am vomiting profusely and I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to make my shift tomorrow.
Manager: have you tried to get coverage? I take this as a sick call.
Me: yes, I messaged my slack group and I haven't heard from anyone that could pick it up.
Manager: okay since you're calling in sick I'm gonna forward this to the day managers, please get better.

I messaged my day team at around 12pm when I woke up (was up until 4/5am sweating and throwing up) and they said management is livid with me. Apparently I ""never called in"" and they say it's a ""no call, no show"". So I'm worried that they're going to fire me. However, I have the phone call in my phone history and I did call in! This is what I always do when I call in sick. Because there is nobody to answer the phones in the morning and calling  1-2 hours before my shift is  not even an option because at that point I definitely won't get coverage and that's more irresponsible than what I did.

I have a stupid pattern where as soon as I sense trouble in a relationship, I turn tail and find somewhere or someone else that's safe. Then I feel instant regret and close off everyone out of shame. I try and pretend nothing has happened and hope it will all go away. I fear telling anyone anything in fear of losing the relationship that I already feel like is crumbling.
After so long has passed I finally give into my subconscious and admit my wrongdoings, watching the people I care about most fall apart because of my actions. I hate it and need it to stop.

I've recently got a job for the summer working at a super market, long, weird shifts, finishing late at night or starting early in the morning. I've been there for just over 3 weeks and have done over 40 hours each week. I've also got a lot of planning for University to do, and other things in my life to sort out for around a months time. - So I am very tired, all the time.

This weekend is my first 2 days off since I started, it's also m Mum's birthday and we have family over for that and to visit for their holiday. 

I was excited to get home so I was kinda rushing, down this long straight road. About half a mile from home I was following a van and he over took a cyclist. I thought the road was clear and followed suit overtaking the cyclist. This is where the event happened. 

A van was coming the other way and was too close for me to safely overtake the cyclist. I started to overtake and realised how close the van was, I slammed on my breaks, swerved back into the left side, realised I could have hit the bike, swerved again almost hit the van. I felt my car go onto 2 wheels one way, then 2 the other. 

I pulled into the ditch and the cyclist came to see if I was alright, then the van driver turned around and came to see me too. He gave me a lecture, which was granted and then I drove home. 

I'm only 18 and have been driving for just over a year. That's the first time I've had something like that happen to me and boy has it fucked me up. I'm not an unsafe driver, but I do like to have some fun from time to time. 

I think I'll be more cautious when driving for a while, especially when tired. These past weeks have tired me out physically and mentally and it was a mistake to rush home tonight.

I like to daydream about ideas, concepts, video, I dream I can do anythings, I take pleasure to think about it anytime in the day.

The problem is when it come to create, i just procrastinate a lot since I'm14, I'm 23 now and I don't have created anythings concrete since.

 Nothings to fulfill my soul, my mind .
Or being proud of somethings.
I remember taking joy to draw , and draw again some character when I was young , I miss is too much....

Now , it's not the fear of failure which keeps me away from creating, it's lost of motivation.
I lake motivation in anythings, that a way to say I'm not a artist at heart and it killing me .

I hope it's fucking false please god make it false .

I use to lied to myself .

"" I will create this and do a little do that after work.""
And it never happen .

And next day it's the same shit and again , and again... since a long time .
I tried to no looking at what people do because I feel guilty I lack motivation , discipline and willpower . They look super human to me .
I'm impressed by what they do and there confidence in the futur, I don't know how to describe it. Really, I feel like shit next to them, and how young some artist start naturally and, I can't take it anymore.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not jealous , just like I missed the race and I come too late.

They say they started since they can hold a pen.
It doesn't happen to me .
I'm selfish because if it continue this way , even if anythings is alright, I will get to end my own life because it's not worth it.
I posted somewhere else but people don't seem to be in this desperate situation , I feel alone and misunderstood by people who don't get why I'm stuck like this.
