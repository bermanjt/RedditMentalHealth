4,"So, I have a suspicion and want opinions. 

My BF of over 10 years recently started working late on a fairly regular basis. It became particularly obvious just before/after Xmas, although I had suspicions before. Generally, I'd get that, loads to do to prepare/catch up on. But, add to that a very hot coworker who comes on to him and a reason for working late that changes from one day to the next ... it makes me feel awkward.

A couple of days ago he said he was going to work late one day next week due to someone's leaving party. Today he is staying late that same day next week because of a big, important company meeting.

He is generally the type of guy who I would never suspect, and I'm not easily fooled. Or so I thought.

Am I being paranoid or should I investigate?",09Jan2017,4
6,"Hey, I'm an Italian student. I am currently studying for my last year of high school in Canada, after the first three years in Italy in an international high school. As in Italy high schools have very specific courses depending on where you go, I chose a scientific set of courses and don't regret it so far. After graduating in Canada, where I'm mainly studying scientific courses, I'll graduate in Italy as well, since we have a 13th grade. After that, I have no clue what to do. I truly enjoy studying, hence I don't have a clear preference on my future university course. Moreover, I'm finding doing research about suggestions on the Internet ""challenging"", as a few writers/friends tend not to give proper statistics but just decide arbitrarily what course is best for you, maybe influenced by what they studied. So, I am curious if anyone here has some good sources about what I should consider or what I should read. Choosing is especially hard because I am interested in many different subjects, and don't have a preference on the city/country. I focused on England as BrExit is actually quite helpful when having to change Euros in Pounds, lowering the value of pounds sensibly. My family has enough money to sustain my studies in Europe or England, though US might be out of my reach, or at least the best-known universities. Lastly, a suggestion I have received was not to apply with my Italian graduation: my school in Italy is particularly hard, so I'm not likely to graduate with anything over 90, since I missed the fourth year as well, while I'll probably graduate from this Canadian high school with an average over 90. Thank you!",09Jan2017,3
7,"It started perhaps a few months ago. Hits randomly, sometimes when I turn it on or I'm on Facebook and says the same thing everytime. ""Crees que me suicido?"" which translate to english as ""Do you think I suicide?"" or ""Do you think I kill myself?""
It's always the same thing too. As it types it seems to miss spell the first senctence a few times and goes back to correct it. The first time I got scared but after the text It stops clicking, also sometimes it moves the mouse by itself like it's searching for something to write on.
I've noted it happening sometimes while playing online, tabing down and opening a video for my other monitor It starts typing the same text.

8,"My best friend is beautiful. Actually drop dead stunning. She gets hit on all the time by men (&amp; women) and yet she still hasn't had her first kiss because every guy she meets always wants to get into her pants and it seems like no one can look past her face to really get to know her. And that sucks. It really does. 

However, I am slightly overweight and remarkably average. I'm the funny one. Approachable. Easy to get to know. And I get to know a lot of people. Especially guys who want to use me to get to my best friend. I'm never going to tell her that, of course. She can't help looking the way she does, and she'd be really upset if I told her. She loves me and is always telling me I'm worth it and that I'll find someone some day. 

But I'm sick and tired of being the approachable one. For all my friends -- not just her. But a large majority of the time, it's for her. I don't blame her, or the guys even for giving it a shot. It's hard to put yourself out there. And she is beautiful and kind and deserves someone great. 

But sometimes I wish people wouldn't flirt with me or talk to me with the end goal of getting to know my friends. It's made me incredibly cyncial and certainly isn't helping my depression at all. To be honest, I'm just trying to accept this as my reality and work on my people skills. 

What else can you do? I can try to lose weight instead of eating my feelings. Maybe swing my probable eating disorder in the other direction. And content myself with my dogs and my friends and making a life for myself. 

And also try to ignore the fact that my younger sister is one of the prettiest people I've ever met (we look nothing alike -- trust me) and stamp down the fact that as she gets older, my friends hitting on her won't be a one time thing, nor will my relatives discussions on how beautiful she is when they think I can't hear and ""Oh well at least [my name] is driven"" and resign myself yet again to a lifetime of being the smart sister as well as crippling inadequatecy, am I right? 

And maybe I won't look at drunk guys phones when trying to call someone to get them and notice that I wasn't even deemed appropriate for a drunk lay in their group texts. Which shouldn't bother me -- I wouldn't sleep with them anyway (find them all pretty distasteful people) and it's not cool to be talked about like you're an object, but it's even less cool when it's not in a positive way!! 

Or think that someone actually wants to talk to me before the inevitable segway into ""Do you think [insert any friend] would give me a chance?"" 

I don't even have standards anymore, people. 

Just sucks, really.

This is how i have been addressing myself in the mirror. I notice it every time i have one of these nights.

It has been getting harder and harder to look at the bright side and its been getting harder and harder to feel like im gonna make it through whatever is wrong with my brain and come out a better person, or even the same person as i was before and, as a result, there ive been having this bizzare sense of disconnection between myself as a person and my brain. As if my brain is this separate entity constantly working against me. Even with little shit. If i was in a bad mood before, id get in my car and take a drive to center myself. I find myself just giving up when the very idea of going out for a drive comes up. That example may not seem like much, but its gotten to an extreme point lately, it seems. When im not at work hating everything about my job, i just kinda... lay there. I come home from work, i have the thought of taking a shower because im a mess after work and the idea shuts itself out of my head, so i just go into my room and i just lay there in my filth.

32,"My long term girlfriend left me. In three weeks I'll be moving in to my new apartment close to the city where we both study.

Our plan was that she'd move in with me once she's finished off her studies, since it'll be one year before I do. I moved down here last year partly to study, do something new and most importantly, so that we could close up our distance. 300 kilometres and a 2h 45m train ride away from my family.

My best friend, favorite human being and girlfriend does not want to be part of my life anymore. I have myself to blame, though. Apparently I fucked up my last shot at keeping this going.

Another thing that made tears run down from my eyes is her family, who I love too. I probably won't ever see them again.

I know that she loves me, at least she didn't stop doing that. She's the love of my life and I am hers too. 

I'm just so lost. In a few hours I have to take the train from my family home to our city since school starts tomorrow. I don't have anyone that can help me out when I'm moving in to my apartment now either, since her parents offered to drive any heavy furniture that I'm about to buy.

How do I even break this to my family? They love her as much as they love me, actually. She's become one of us.

Whenever I have problems, she is my go-to person that can help me out just by hugging me. Everything becomes irrelevant. I miss her so incredibly much.

Lately, for the past 3 weeks, I have done nothing but enjoyed my time doing nothing. For example, I have just been playing Xbox, sit around with family, and watching movies with my girlfriend. It started out on December 21, I went on vacation for Christmas for a week. The night before I was supposed to come back I was having chest pains, breathing problems, and sleeping problems. I went to the ER, and they determined nothing was really wrong with my body. The only thing they concluded was there may have been an inflammation with the muscle around my chest and they prescribed me just a high dose of Ibuprofen. So I took a few days off of work. The few days have now turned into 3 weeks. I am depressed, my body is aching, and I just sit around doing nothing. I still somewhat have the symptoms. The chest pain not so much. I am also a person that never get sick. So for me to feel this way is oddly strange. It's raising my anxiety because I've never experienced this much medical issues before. I haven't told the doctors about my transition, because I didn't think it was necessary. But now I'm second-guessing. I would like to know why is my body feeling this way. Is it because of my quick transition from working every day to doing nothing every day? If you need anymore information, just ask. Thank you.

I have a history of self-harm and one suicide ""attempt"" (I made the preparations, got seconds away from doing it). I am trying to recover, I am attending an NA meeting tomorrow.

I just got out of an abusive relationship with a guy who was just like my dad. We had been together for over a year, we were engaged, we lived together. Then he cheated on me over Christmas so I broke up with him and kicked him out. I didn't realize how emotionally abusive he was, and how similar to my dad he was, until now. 

I have been drinking a lot recently and every time I drink I bring up the fact that I think my dad sexually abused me. I have one memory of being alone with him in our house as a child. One memory. Otherwise, I don't remember ever being alone with him at home, I definitely was, my mom was working all the time. This memory makes me feel sick, ashamed, guilty. I thought I resented him because he was emotionally abusive and treated my mom like shit, but it's more than that. 

But what if nothing happened. What if I am just making this up. Or overreacting. 

Part of me knows it happened, all of my doesn't want to believe it did. 

He fucking knows, though. He has to. But I can't ask him, I can't confront him, he would deny everything. 

This explains a lot as to why I am the way that I am today. 

He's not even my ""real"" dad. I was raised by my biological mother's mom, and him, her husband. I am not even related to him. Both of my biological parents were drug addicts. He's a drug addict, he has been abusing xanax and pills for a long time. 

Once, as a child (I have no concept of time or age), I had intrusive thoughts about killing my dad. I remember having a panic attack in the bathroom, completely distraught.

46,"Hey, so I'm more looking for advice than asking a specific question. I don't know if this is the right place, so if not, please point me to the right subreddit. Thanks!

So I was a sophomore at a very nice university. In my major, the median starting rate 100k a year. So like I was going to make bank. However, I have no work ethic, and I fell into very bad depression and had problems with bulimia, so I eventually started using drugs. 

My drug use escalated very quickly, and I was using hard drugs within 6 months of first using. In my sophomore year, I overdosed, and the school encouraged me to take the year off to go to rehab, and so I did. I have the option of going back, but it requires like a lot of treatment and recommendation letters, and to be honest, I'm not sure I'll be able to handle the stress. 

I started reading about being a stripper, and it seems that girls make quick cash and they can pick their own hours. I'm just not sure I'm the stripper type. I have always been really introverted and shy and have had low self-esteem. I posted a few times to r/gonewild and had positive replies saying I had a nice body. I'm like 5'2 and on meth, I weigh 90 lb but right now I'm like 110. I'm not toned at all because I never exercise. I'm very good at listening to problems though and faking genuine compassion. I heard that's a good skill. I look really young, like I pass as 14. I don't know about the industry but my friend says that they like young girls. 

Anyway I figured I'd make a list of pros and cons.

Pros:

- Can make a lot of money quickly. Why would I need money? Although I'm technically ""in recovery"" for drugs, I do want money to spend on drugs. I won't lie here.
- Learn better street/social skills. I grew up a very shy kid with no social skills. Most of my friends are online friends and I spent most of my high school online and on forums
- Confidence. I don't see stripping as degrading. I feel like I'd increase my self esteem by having people call me sexy or say I'm beautiful.

Cons:

- I have bad anxiety/paranoia about being raped and murdered
- I've never had sex and have never done any like sexual activity besides making out with a guy because I'm really shy
- when I'm drunk, I'm all over a guy 
- My parents and counselor would probably be against it.

My friend has a fairly large family, at the time there were 7 people in the family, and they also had his cousin's family visiting, which was 4 people. My friend, his cousin, and his cousin's younger brother and I are all about the same age, so we get along pretty well and we usually hang out and do stuff together. 

 That night we were all in his room, and we played a game of cards before going to bed. 
  After falling asleep, I did something to this day I still cannot explain. I woke up in the middle of the night, and started screaming at the top of my lungs, for about 10 seconds straight. After about 10 seconds had passed, I finally came to and stopped screaming, and internally questioned myself and asked myself why the fuck I did what I did. Shortly thereafter, my friend's mom bursts into the room asking if I'm alright, to which I replied something along the lines of ""I don't know... I just started screaming and I don't know why."" I'm almost certain I woke up everyone in that house up. 

  Also, this wasn't the first instance I had done something like that. When I was at my own house sleeping on another occasion, I woke up in the middle of the night and started screaming unexplainably. I woke up both of my brothers and my father, who again bursted into my room and asked what was wrong. I really wish I knew why I did that.
