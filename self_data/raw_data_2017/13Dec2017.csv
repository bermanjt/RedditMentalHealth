8,"**TL;DR: I learned the hard way that if you lend out money, you should assume you're never seeing a penny back. I make good money but I got screwed over by multiple people and now debt is spiraling out of control. I've lost faith in humanity. Need a hug. Need a miracle. Need a friend who won't stab me in the back.**

I lent money to several different ""friends"" several times over the past year. I didn't have much saved up, but I had a lot of available credit and no debt to speak of, so I put a bunch of their bills on my credit cards under the condition that they'd pay me back after a set amount of time. It felt good, because I feel like we should always help out our friends.

Unfortunately, none of them were really my friends, because literally every one of them ended up screwing me over. Most just ghosted me, one declared bankruptcy, one threatened to accuse me (falsely) of sexual assault.

All this has made me depressed beyond measure. I'm over $10k in debt, my credit score is now **** so I can't get a loan at any sort of decent interest rate, I feel like have no real friends, my work performance is suffering, and I'm dangerously close to relapsing into some self-destructive behaviors. I've also had to raise the dosage of my antidepressants, which is even more out of my pocket.

I'm doing everything I can to get myself out of the debt, but I'm continually haunted by the fact that so many individuals -- who I considered close friends -- turned out to be such awful people. There's this constant irrational fear that everyone I know is secretly just waiting to stiff me, and there are no decent people in the world.",13Dec2017,2
11,"I got an internship in a small restaurant nearby our Uni (I'm 19, but not in Uni) and yesterday I was standing idle behind the counter when a really cute girl passed by and smiled at me, but I was obviously working and couldn't go talk to her. She also walked away right away.  
Maybe she's a student, I don't know, but I might never see her again and it really bums me out. 

I'm really socially awkward and never get any attention from girls so when a cute girl smiles at me it makes my world.  
Also our working clothes aren't the prettiest so the sight of me probably wasn't very good, but she **did** give me a smile.

I'm probably just thinking too much of it.",13Dec2017,6
12,"It's called the [""Proyecto para la Restauración de la Libertad Religiosa en Puerto Rico""](https://www.metro.pr/pr/noticias/2017/12/10/senado-aprueba-proyecto-libertad-religiosa.html), or the Restoration of Religious Liberty Act. Let's just call it the RRLA for convenience's sake. A traditionally conservative mayority in the Senate and House of Puerto Rico have been trying to silently pass this under everyone's radar and trying their best to face as little resistance as possible. The main detractors to this project have been the Puerto Rican governor and the opposition party.

A quick backstory. The Puerto Rican political system is mayorly composed of two parties, with numerous lesser parties in between. The Democratic Popular Party, which advocates for maintaining the current territorial status quo, traditionally aligns with centre-left politics. The New Progressive Party, which advocates for statehood, traditionally aligns with centre-right politics. The DPP (or PPD in Spanish) mostly aligns itself with the Democratic Party. The NPP (or PNP in Spanish) mostly aligns itself with the Republican Party. (This is not particularly exclusive to the politicians inside those parties, however, as for example, the Governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rosello, a member of the PNP, is a Democrat.) The key fact I will try to state here is that these two parties have been progressively moving further apart in the political spectrum. Enter the particular wave of PNP politicians pushing this project.

This said project was set forth by PNP representative Guillermo Miranda Rivera back on the month of May. Immediately as it was set forth, Governor Rossello (the methaphorical current head of the party) made his intention to veto it known and deauthorized the project. This did not stop co-author María Milagros Charbonier (remember this name) from continuing to push it. As it went along, backers such as the President of the House of Representatives Carlos ""Johnny"" Méndez Núñez and the President of the Senate Thomas Rivera Schatz (all PNP politicians) were vocal about their support for the project and were quick to distance themselves from the ""allegations that this project would limit or remove rights from the LGBTT community"".

[Here is the project I am referring to](http://cb.pr/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Proyecto-de-la-Cámara-1018.pdf).

It is, unfortunately, only available in Spanish, but I trust that a quick rundown through Google Translate can give you an idea of what it says.

Senators such as the three I mentioned earlier have been some of the most pungent of politicians Puerto Rico has had in recent years. Milagros Charbonier is a opressively-religious nutjob, infamous for [denying the press the freedom of speech](http://www.latinorebels.com/2017/07/13/puerto-rican-newspaper-cancels-pepito-comic-for-comparing-politician-to-garbage-can/) and expressions such as [comparing homosexuality to bestialism and pedophilia](http://www.noticel.com/ahora/charbonier-equipara-orientacin-sexual-con-pedofilia-y-bestialismo/608136554). Johnny Méndez is particularly known for [officially declaring 40 days of fasting in the House of Representatives and legally asking for divine intervention to help with Puerto Rico's debt](https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/politica/nota/johnnymendezdecreta40diasdeayunoypidelaintervenciondivina-2292285/). Rivera Schatz is your [friendly neighborhood strongman](https://www.metro.pr/pr/entretenimiento/2017/03/16/periodista-divulga-fuerte-conversacion-thomas-rivera-schatz.html), leading the ranks of the PNP party members in the Legislative Branch.

I could go out on an all-out tirade against Puerto Rican politics, but for the sake of keeping this short, I'll end it here. This project was approved this last Sunday on an extraordinary session by the PNP mayority, with the entirety of the PPD delegation and other senators voting against it. All that is left is for a committe to examine it and for the Governor to sign it. I don't pretend to have produced a manifesto here; I only hope to have given you enough of a reason to go against this. Please.",13Dec2017,5

14,"I am 27 and I love my SO very much. i married three years ago, we trying to live independent because we know, our family isn't rich and they are working hard to get what they have now, so we have decided to try our best to living. we live in rent house, my SO is a contributor to a local website, and I teaching in a little public school in the little city with low salary. We are trying our best to support each other. But, at the first year of marriage, my SO lost his job as full time worker. We have no worries, we promised that money will never ever be a problem in our relationship. 

After that, my SO try to be a freelancer and of course its totally different with full time-worker. He just get paid if there is any project. Money is always tight. We try everything to get money (in legal way), we both joined some writing competition, we both try to get a better job, we both even fasting when we have no money for food. Yeah, sometimes its happened. We've no complain. We just try our best to solve the problem when its comes. 

Then I know that my SO miss his dad badly. It's the fifth year since the last time he met his father. And even in our marriage his father doesn't come because he must take care of his father (grandfather's of SO). And even when the grandfather died, we disable to afford to visit them. My SO was crying hard that day. We're parting far away, it can only reach by airplane or 5 days by ship because our country is archipelago one. And ofcourse it'll need a lot money to go there. 

The problem is saving money is hard. With money tight. Even if we're fasting some days. 

I really want him to meet his father. I want to meet him too. As a wife, I wont' complain about how hard to have no money or food, I won't complain about we have never buy luxury things, because I love him so much. His love for me is enough. We can laugh and cry together. But, I want to make him happy by meet his father. But its seems impossible and I am feeling desperate about it :(

15,"So I became friends with this girl. We got closer and closer for the past year and a half, closer than I’ve ever been with any girl in my life. Somewhere along the line I developed feelings for her. She has a boyfriend though. I thought long and hard about telling her how I feel, cause sometimes seeing her with someone else is pretty rough. But over the months and months we have become joined at the hip. We are honestly best friends. Having her in my life has improved it in so many different ways, I can’t face the thought of not talking to her everyday. So I’ve just bit my tongue, tried to bury how I feel for now and try keep my mind open. If it’s meant to be, it will happen and all that. And besides, I don’t want to get in the way of her relationship.

And that’s where the problem is. Because I feel like just by being this close with her, I am starting to get in the way. I can see this leading to drama down the line and I don’t know what I should do. The thing is that she still flirts with me quite a lot. Usually it’s just playful and harmless, and I get that people just flirt for fun, but sometimes it just seems a little too far I guess while she has a boyfriend. For instance, she tells me almost every time her and her boyfriend have a little argument here and there so I can tell her whether she’s over-reacting or whatever lmao. Anyway, multiple times they’ve been arguing she’s joked about how she should just dump him and date me instead. And while I can tell by her tone she’s joking, it just seems like a joke that wouldn’t get made unless there was some nugget of truth there.

I also think her boyfriend sees me as a threat, which I don’t know if I’m comfortable with. I’ve noticed for a long time when she’s around him she’ll message me at a bare minimum, and her response will be really short like she doesn’t want him thinking we talk all the time. Today she argued with him, and said she’s gonna not talk to him for a bit to cool off. She said I’ll probably overtake him as her best friend on snapchat, and that it will piss him off but she doesn’t care. I joked and said I didn’t want her dragging me into her shit, but really that’s true. Like the fact he would get annoyed about that clearly shows he’s aware of how much we talk and it would make him feel shitty. She replied saying ‘it’s okay, I love you more than him anyway, you’re the one for me’. Usually she would have left it at that, cause I can tell when she’s just joking, but she sent another message straight after that before I could reply saying ‘just kidding lol but I do love you though!’ The fact she has to clarify it as a joke now makes it seem like she knows I might take it seriously if you get me. Like she never used to do that. Stuff like this happens more and more often now.

I dunno. Just lately it’s like there’s an unspoken tension between us. There’s loads of other stuff I could mention, the stuff I did is just like the big examples. Like the flirting’s got more common and I feel like it’s not just completely a joke anymore. Maybe she’s figured out how I feel and that would explain the change, but I also feel like if she had she’d cut the jokes back rather than lay them on harder.  I get the impression like she’s trying to test the waters with me or something to see how I feel. It’s just an odd situation. Like I had resigned myself to just being her friend for now, and moving on the best I could while remaining friends, but flirting like this just makes it hard to take my mind off it completely without wondering what’s going on in her head.

**TL;DR:** My best friend and I have always had kinda flirty jokes. Now though she has to clarify it’s a joke, but they’ve been happening more and more. I also get the impression her boyfriend thinks I’m a threat, and like she wants to test the waters and see how I feel about her. Am I reading into this too much?",13Dec2017,1

17,"So hey Reddit,

I met a guy while doing grad school things. On our first date, I mentioned that my first celebrity crush happened when I was a little kid. It was on the guy who played Peter Pan in the 2003 live action movie. We kept texting during my final exams and I said that when they were all over, I was gonna drink wine and re-watch Peter Pan. He asked if he could join me.


Now, when an attractive, intellectual dude offers to watch my favourite childhood movie with me, I'm not going to say no. That was a smooth move on his part. I approve(d).


I did want to impress him though. I've been cooking for myself to save money since starting this whole master's degree business, but I have a lot of weird shortcuts and adapted techniques to cope with my palsy.


I was running behind schedule and he arrived at my apartment while I was still cooking (I decided to make him chicken picatta with wine and chicken stock in the sauce alongside some penne). He ended up helping me open some of the ingredients that were stuck in jars and he was very thankful and patient for the meal.


Reddit, we didn't even end up watching the movie. We just ate food, drank wine, and talked until it was four in the morning. He ended up staying over, completely in a non-sexual way, and I felt really respected and appreciated.

I did the dishes after he left this morning. Looking over my dirty pots and pans, the chopped parsley still on the cutting board, the empty wine glasses (which I admittedly bought the night before)...This feeling of immense pride came over me.

I grew up in a household where neither parent could cook. My mom fed us potatoes and unseasoned, overcooked meat, microwave meals, or frozen chicken nuggets, pizzas, and french fries until we were old enough to fend for ourselves. After that point, eating a meal at the table together was a very, very special occasion. There was no lunch time or dinner time, we just came out of our rooms when we were hungry, microwaved ourselves cans of soup, and retreated.


I'm a disabled woman. This is my first time living on my own. Doing things with my hands is super difficult. Standing over a stove hurts my calves.


And here I am, doing philosophy, reading these centuries-old texts and not only understanding them, but criticizing them accurately. On top of that, I managed to meet someone who likes doing the same things, is a very satisfying conversational partner, and I cooked an actual, fresh meal for him. One that required knife movements and other fine-motor skills.


I feel like I'm succeeding in being the classic domestic woman I've kind of always wanted to be (but felt guilty for wanting to be because feminism) and I've done something that has taken me away from the narrative of being the one who needs to be cared for (a real struggle when you're disabled) and I was able to provide nourishment and care for someone else. AND I'M DOING ACADEMIA TOO. WHAT?!


If I may say so myself, the food looked pretty and it was delicious.


I feel like I'm living in one of the fantasies that I would have daydreamed about when I was eighteen. I just feel like such an adult woman. It's a power trip. It's kinda terrifying, but it's mostly awesome.

19,"So I'm on vacation with my husband at a hotel in Spain.

Earlier that day, my know-it-all husband deeply embarrassed me by loudly making fun of my horrible Spanish pronunication in front of our gorgeous waiter, making him and another table full of people laugh hysterically at me.

One morning I get woken up and I hear panicked, desperate knocking at the outdoor patio at about 12:30 am. I get chills.

I cautiously walk closer.

It's my husband whispering ""Nancy---NANCY---p-p-please open the door NOW!""

I go to grab the sliding glass door...then I'm skeptical. I can't see him out there. It's so dark.

""What are you doing out there?""

He says ""Don't worry about that, please just open the door!""

I go to turn on the light. He yells ""N-n-n-NO! Please DON'T!""

I say you're talking crazy. I turn the light on.

My husband is standing there, locked outside.

...naked hehehe.

I laughed so hard.

He covered his little package and said ""Please let me in!""

I asked him what he was doing.

He said he tried to run outside to get a photo of the full moon real quick, but all he had on were his boxers, and they caught on the chair and ripped right off his butt as he stumbled outside.

That made me laugh till I had tears in my eyes. ""Full moon? Now you're showing off YOUR OWN full moon! My God that butt must be jiggling up a storm hahaha!""

My know-it-all, 38 year old professor hubby, as nekkid as the day he was born, chubby belly under a spotlight for the world to see.

Still looking like the embarrassed, vulnerable virgin geek he was when we met 8 years ago lol.

I said ""Oh my God you are SO naked. You aren't even wearing socks! Hahahaha""

He said ""Nancy PLEASE it's COLD!""

Suddenly a few neighbor's lights went on, and my bare-assed naked husband was pleading to get inside.

Time for some fun as the cherry on top for him humiliating me this afternoon.

I said ""I'd love to take you just as are and ride you all night long."" Uh-oh, now my nekkid hubby has a little boner popping up for the world to see lol.

I made him yell ""NANCY IS THE QUEEN!"" before letting him in and slapping that bare, white, round BOOTY as hard as I could.

As his exposed white tushie ran inside, along with his erection bobbing down the hallway, I turned around to see a woman my age give me a ""NICE!"" thumbs up, hold up her camera phone, and do an AIR-smack to those buns! hahaha

24,"The idea is that hand guns are ridiculously inaccurate and cops know it.  You usually hear any shooting being the cop fired like 6 or 7 times and the target was hit once or twice.  The cop thinks that if he doesn't get off multiple shots before the target draws, they basically have a 50/50 chance of losing.

If they had rifles that were accurate, they could give the target a few extra seconds more to make sure they have a gun.  At that point, the pre-drawn and pointed rifle would only need a couple shots.  Sure, the cop probably will take more, but at least at that point he was sure his target had a gun.

27,"The US system of government was based on the idea that people's interests would roughly be represented by geographical region.  

So you get to vote only on the representative for your geographical area, and the representatives could hash out the different interests of the regions in their respective elective bodies. 

And in that way, people could influence the nation through their own elected officials, and otherwise people would have very little to do with one another.

But in modern times, technology and the interconnectedness of everything means that an election in a far off state can have a tremendous impact on your day to day life on issues ranging from taxes to pollution to nuclear war to net neutrality to civil rights and so on.  

So it's not enough to just make sure your own house is in order - we also have to make sure that we pay sufficient attention to the elections and politics in far off places that we arrogantly think have nothing to do with us.  

This is why Democrats have to have a 50 state strategy like Howard Dean wanted - it's a way of bringing red state working class voters into the fold and letting them know that we care about them enough to at least help them help themselves by electing Democrats.  

It's arrogant and unrealistic to think in this age of global interconnectedness that we have nothing to do with one another.  

That's what the global plutocrats want - people fighting each other over scraps because they didn't learn to care about one another and cooperate to take down the people who are abusing, exploiting, and robbing them blind.

The solution to plutocracy, and the re-binding of American society will happen through both carrots and sticks.  

The carrots have to be that we learn to look out for one another as Americans and humans, and realize that we can and do have a tremendous impact on one another.  We can pay attention to each others' elections, politics, interests, and concerns.  

The sticks will have to be a decentralized auto-divestment/death provision so that global plutocrats don't hoard resources unnecessarily, which, like slavery a long time ago and sexual harassment until recently, is a crime against humanity which is currently unrecognized, but which is due for an update in society's moral code:

32,"Advice needed: both genders welcome, but esp. women's perspective.

My wife (35f and I (36m) got married ~2 years ago.  Before marriage, she loved sex and wanted it 3X a week.  However, after getting married, she stopped desiring sex. In fact, in our 1-Week honeymoon (right after the wedding), we only made love twice-- and she did it unenthusiastically.

The lack of interest in sex continued.  After the recent birth our first child (&amp; she completely healed), it has gotten worse... in fact, it is now downright insulting.  When I tell her I want her, she would sigh, say she is tired (she is a housewife FYI).  Or, on our agreed Tuesday love-making night, she'd sigh and say ""I thought you forgot about it..."", etc.

She would SAY that she loves me, but how can she not know this hurts my self esteem when she regularly responds to me this way?  
Maybe she does love me as a partner but not find me physically attractive , but how could that happen so distinctively once we cross the ""marriage"" line? 

Note1: Yes, I can make her cum like a flood ~50% of the time... but I tend to last longer when I'm not blue-balled.
Note2: I don't force myself upon her physically, of course, and I respect her wishes.  After all, a real marriage requires respect.

She taught me one thing that I try to always remember: It's okay to cry. You don't have to be okay all the time. Your emotions are valid and real.

It was a terrible, abusive relationship. The way she treated me was the sole reason I had these terrible emotions that drove me to tears. By the end, I was suicidal, bouncing in and out of mental hospitals.

It's been a little over a year now, and I'm still having trouble being alright. However, emotion is what makes living life. I find that the value of an experience is directly proportional to the intensity of emotion it instills.

He let me pay for everything including rent and didn't have the decency to at least help before just taking off. To top it off he refuses to address the fact that he still owes half the bills, and just told me to ""just cancel everything"".We fought over the weekend but things were fine (at least I thought) for the few days before this happened. 8 years is a long time to be with someome. I guess im just wondering what now? Where do i even begin to move on? I am completely devastated that someone who claimed to love me, could leave without even saying one thing. I feel like he completely erased me from his life and never cared. ",13Dec2017,64

54,"It wasn't new information that my brother has anger problems. I was his designated punching bag through childhood until he moved out and got a girlfriend. We would get into screaming matches over the stupidest things, and when I would try to lock my door to get away from him (because I was scared) he would break through the lock and get right up in my face to start screaming again. I finally told my dad everything a few years ago, and from then things have seemingly been fine until now.

I got a text from his girlfriend last night at around midnight saying that my brother had locked her in a closet and beat her. She tried screaming and banging on the walls so the neighbors would call the cops, but eventually got out with her cat. I can't help but feel responsible for this. I know logically it wasn't my fault, but part of me feels like if I would've talked to my brother more to try to figure out his anger issues, none of this would've happened. I also wish that I could've warned his girlfriend to get out of the relationship, but logically I know she wouldn't have listened. 

Now I can't stop thinking about how terrified she must've been. I've been in her shoes before where I didn't know what he was capable of or willing to do to make his point. I just feel so terrible that he would do something like this.

57,"First of all: Sorry this is so long and more a rambling than anything else. Also: English is not my first language. So on to my problem. 

I (34,f) am what I'd call a social introverted person. I'm good with people, have a firm circle of friends, no problem talking to strangers or holding a speech. But nevertheless – social interaction is exhausting for me and when I can't be on my own for a stretch of time I get moody and am not pleasant to be around. 

I've been single nearly all my life due to circumstances. Though it bothered me in my teens and twens I don't really care anymore. At least most of the time. I admit that sometimes I wish there was someone to just hold me in their arms when I had a rough day. These are the times I feel lonely and wish for a partner, but usually I'm happy again the next day. 

In the past there were times when I felt motivated looking for a partner. I tried nearly everything and every common platform like Tinder or even pages with monthly fees. All without much success to show. I got matches without problems and occasionally I also met up with someone, but I always quit the subscription very soon, as the whole dating thing actually stressed me. I'm a person that's not constantly on their phone. I like chatting with people, but I usually write big blocks of text and like to receive them too. I don't like this one-phrase-chatting that keeps you on the phone for hours on end and really, the men from these dating-sites expected exactly that and don't you even dare not answering for a couple of minutes. 

So I haven't had a date in more than a year and I wasn't looking for one either. But now a guy I know through mutual friends asked me out last week. We've met several times at these friends' place, usually when there was a party. We always got along really well, though I never felt a spark. He's absolutely not my type in almost everything you can have preferences in, but in the end none of this really matters. I actually like him and we have a lot of interests in common. Hell – he even likes one of my favorite music bands that most of my friends never even heard about. I agreed for a date, inwardly cheering myself on to just give it a chance. 

But now, the nearer the date comes, the more anxious I get. I remember all the reasons I didn't want to try dating again. My main reason? I've just got not time for that!

During the week I leave house for work at 5:40 am and the earliest I come back is 5 pm, if I don't have to do some grocery shopping. Teamwork is essential in my profession so I deal with colleagues and people for the majority of my time at work. After coming home I do a bit of work-out, take a shower, do the daily chores (like cleaning the cats' litterboxes) and every couple of days things like vacuuming. Deep cleaning is reserved for the weekends. After cooking and eating it's easily 7 pm and I'm looking at two hours of free time, before I have to prepare my lunch and clothes for next morning and go to bed. 

I NEED these two hours of relaxing, reading a book or reddit, watching a bit of TV. The mere thought of having to share this time with another person and maybe even entertain them is pure horror for me (one of the many reasons I decided long ago to never have children). Having a person constantly around me just makes me bitchy. I've been to several vacations with two of my best friends. I love them. But every couple of days I have to escape them for some hours to just be alone again. Otherwise I can't even stand myself anymore, let alone other people. 

Then there is the weekends, when I'm doing all the chores I have no time for during the week, meet my friends and family, spend time with my nephew and god-daughters, watch sports with my father. Truly free days are very rare – I yearn them. But most of the time I'm happy about a really quiet Sunday afternoon/evening. One of the things I love most is writing stories and I don't even get to do that, since I can't find the time. 

Thing is, I've been singe for so long that I arranged my life around other things. I don't get bored. I don't have times when I sit at home and stare into the void because I don't know what to do. Where the hell do I fit dating or a partner in there? Are there any other introverts who need their alone-time to function like a human that are in a committed relationship and can explain this to me?

And since I have a splendid imagination (hence the story-writing...) I picture how life could be if the miracle happens and dating turns into a relationship. The thought that someone else buys groceries for my (our!) pantry is ridiculous to me. And it also scares me a bit. I've been living independently for 12 years now. Everything I have I made on my own. I'd probably have a hard time giving away some of that independence. Having to compromise what thing to watch in TV? Boy, I've got things to learn, I guess... 

So long story short: I'm having this date and already wonder how this could ever work out. And I wouldn't be thoroughly sad if it didn't. I'm happy with my life as it is. 

But what if there is more? What if I only have to give it a chance to learn another aspect of life I never knew? I want to go into the date open-minded but still feel myself blocking already. 

Do you have any guidance for me? Anyone wants to virtually give me a kick in the ass? Or is it just possible and okay to be relationship-incompatible?


TLDR: Life-long single things she doesn't have time for dating, but a tiny part of her really wants to.  ",13Dec2017,8
58,"To start it off I'm Hella inexperienced and have a little social anxiety. So I'm just getting over this one girl I was dating who found someone else (I took things too slow and didn't communicate intentions) and I decide to ask out this other girl I met on tinder who I was really interested in getting to know. Our first ""date"" was to six flags was fun, she seemed flirty, poking my shoes, tugging at my shirt, etc. Then we had a surprising amount of things in common. I took her on top of one of the buildings on campus and we looked at the city skyline and talked for a while and I thought we had a crazy connection. Now that I look back I think she did mention she wasn't ready for any relationship while we were on the roof, but when I took her back to her place later that night she wrote directions on a paper and put a bunch of hearts on it and I was like goddamn and immediately fell for her. Took her to a concert next and tried to be a little romantic, felt a little off but still thought things were going good. We went longboarding in a park next and when we got done we just sat and talked and I felt like she was genuinely interested in something developing between us. We go to the mall together the next week and I ask her about her ex, she sorta explains things then she mentions she doesn't need a relationship because it's a distraction, takes too much time, etc. but I'm already getting attached and interpret it as her considering a relationship but just not ready - and it might sound cringey but I would be willing to wait until she is ready so I kinda brush it off. Next date we haven't seen each other in a while - we went opposite directions for the Thanksgiving break, but I ask her about six flags again and so we go the next weekend and while st first she seemed 's little distant we start really getting into everything and she's holding onto me during some of the more intense rides. When I'm taking her back she almost invited me to stay a while at her place but she backtracks a little and decided on the park instead - and we talked for a while. I take her home, we hug, and she compliments my outfit and stuff so I feel good again. Fast forward a few days and she's drunk and starts messaging me. At first she's just being a goofball but I say something that reminds her that she doesn't want a relationship right now, but this time she says it's because she isn't over her ex and that he's still bothering her but that I'm cute and that ""we have our moments"". I'm pretty sure she broke up with him like a few months ago but I also think she hasn't been serious about ending it with him as she seems to be in more contact than is healthy. I can't tell but it looks like she blocked/unfriended him on Facebook and Instagram but she recently set up her steam account on his phone because hers broke. So it's a big Wtf. What really messed me up though is that I asked her about everything when she was sober again and she said she never meant to lead me on or be flirty and that she never considered a relationship between the two of us. It also irritates me that I tried not to get attached, I stayed on tinder and stuff and was trying to set up dates and whatnot but I just never got serious - the more I learned about her the more I wanted her and that's how I feel now. I want someone to be with but I'm not over her - I just want to wait for her, I know that's not healthy but I can't help but feeling like she's the one and I just need to be patient. Last time a girl rejected me there were people I wanted to get to know and try things out with but now I just feel stuck. I told her most of this, about how I feel, and she said she understood and she wants to build a friendship but I can't help but want more.

59,"I just wanted to know since my family is the classic case.My mother moved to this country 30 yrs ago from Morocco.She bounced around from man to man until she found my father.Then she became pregnant with me which allowed her to stay in the country.She was disabled &amp; automatically given disability back in the 80s.My father is a paranoid schizophrenic who hasnt worked a day in 35 years.Family of five living off of $1,800/month.We bounced round (my two brothers &amp; I) from poor elementary to poor middle to poor high school,no car so we had to wake up early for school bus.MY grades wavered between good &amp; bad.One brother (a year younger than me) was expelled from high school at 16 for theft from the school cafeteria.Eventually he did get a GED......in jail.....but I'll explain later.I barely graduated high school but because my birthday was in December I was held back a year from enrolling in Kindergarden by the state of FL.I was bullied in middle &amp; high school relentlessly.Teachers say this....but did nothing.In middle school I had a chorus teacher that really cared &amp; could see me suffering but was helpless to do anything.My parents has a rule....dont tell anyone your business.Their silence caused me to drift further down into obscurity &amp; sadness.We just didnt have the financial resources for me to get therapy.My parents labeled me a hypochondriac &amp; a troublemaker if I ever reached out to anyone for assistance.No Child Left Behind forced them to graduate me from high school with a 2.5 G.P.A. even though I failed my science class that year with a D.I NEVER had a single counselor call me in to discuss college or my future.I NEVER had a single counselor ASK me anything.I NEVER had a single counselor ask me why I looked so sad in class.I assumed the counselors were on a coffee break.I was on the school free lunch program but the food tasted so nasty I often went without eating or used a few bucks here &amp; there to buy cheesesticks.My life at home was a living hell.The highlight of my day was shopping day each month when I could buy a yogurt.I was only counting the days when I could be poor alone instead of with these losers.The state of FL didnt have college readiness procedures so I was dumped on the world &amp; they didnt give a shit what I did after that.Backwater mentality as can be but that is just my opinion.My extreme social anxiety &amp; shyness prevented me from giving the final project presentation in science class my senior year of high school.We lived off of Sec 8 until we were thrown off the federal Sec 8 program because one of my two brothers caused so much violent hell we were evicted &amp; he was banned from living with us under the same Sec 8 voucher.When me moved to another apartment that year (NON Sec 8) 5 months after the first eviction we were evicted AGAIN....because of the same violent son.He grew weary of our life of poverty &amp; just snapped.


I moved out for good in October 2012 after I realized that these losers were going to either get me hurt or committed to a mental institution.Eventually in January of 2009 that same brother (a year younger than me) accepted a plea bargain of 10 yrs for armed robbery for going out one night &amp; trying to rob someone in another low income housing complex with a gun.Our state at the time had serious gun rider laws (10,20,life) so there was no hope for him.If he had gone to trial they would have out him away for 20 yrs.My mother has been forever cracked.It really broke her &amp; every time she passes the local jail...she cries on cue.She calls me heartless because I wont visit them or call my brother in prison.Mind you......this same brother (I have two) has repeatedly  physically assaulted me &amp; threatened us in the past.One time he actually threatened me from prison (hope they didnt record that) for moving out &amp; ""leaving my mother"" that January 2009 when he was arrested &amp; forced to take the plea.He said he would hurt me when he got out but being in prison that was a false threat.I do fear the day he gets out.My mothers family (from Morocco) is extremely controlling &amp; bipolar,I think.Maybe that's just my mother's sister (my aunt).They believe that family must stay very close &amp; connected.My mother freaks out if i dont call her constantly.Well,thanks to that same brother my mother never got her Sec 8 voucher back because of the waiting lists.Then  the youngest brother (6 yrs younger than me) learned violent tendencies from the other brother.Back in September of this year he got a DUI,I assume,&amp; had his Driver's license suspended.He moved a girlfriend in &amp; they took over my mother's apartment.My father is a paranoid schizophrenic &amp; has no power,apparently.He prefers to think that Jehovah will fix everything.Goodness.....

Anyway,my youngest brother started physically assaulting my mother &amp; harassing her for money.After I moved out in 2012 he just took over.My mother is legally blind in one eye &amp; weak in parenting.He was living rent free by the way.In the end.....AGAIN....management there told her they wouldn't renew her lease because of another disrespectful son.My mother called me totally distraught &amp; asked for $500 to pay her rent or she would be homeless.The following month,October of this year,she was forced to move because they wouldnt renew her lease.So my money was wasted &amp; she didnt learn her lesson.She moved to another state to get away from the youngest son.She said she would never leave her home of 30 yrs but I guess she found a cheaper apartment &amp; decided to take the risk.


Now.....after all of that....I ask a simple but complex question.How could any of this have been prevented?Simple,my parents could've not had kids when they couldn't take care of themselves.I wish I was born into a rich acting family like Bill Skarsgard.He had scripts handed to him at age 16 just because of his father....actor Stellan Skarsgard.Now,I'm going to college 10 yrs after high school just for the fun of it.I might major in theatre or film.Why not.....my anxiety &amp; possible upcoming Autism (Aspergers was deleted as a term in 2013) diagnosis causes great problems with living in this sick world today.Jobs are being eliminated by technology or outsourced overseas.


Guess I just got the short end of the stick in life.Great.

I posted this in /r/confession as a response to a user’s post in the sub, but mine was removed because it isn’t a confession. Understandable. So I hope he still sees this. But anyway.

This is specifically for you, /u/throwahoyway, so anyone else doesn’t need to spend time on this. I suggest *you* do, though.

So this is a gigantic situation in itself for me, and I planned on sharing it here or a more relevant sub for it soon because I’m having like PTSD in my gut or some shit surrounding it as of late for some fucking reason, but for now I’ll share what’s relevant to this other user’s situation: I put a restraining order on my ex boyfriend.

I dated him from when I was 15 to when I was 17. He was verbally and emotionally abusive the whole time. We met when we were super young, one single time, I was like 11, he moved and we kept in touch and had a long distance relationship for more than two years. So it never had the chance to get physical. He was, however, a boxer, and that’s relevant because one day while he was on the phone with me he was looking everywhere for his phone charger and finally found it in his sister’s room. He didn’t give her permission to use it, so he found her, and punched her in the face. He was 17, I was 16, and she was like 14 or 15. She called the cops, and since he was a boxer, his fists were considered weapons and he then was given a charge of assault with battery. It’s on his permanent record, and I had absolutely no doubts from there on out that if I were ever to be with him in person he’d have done much worse to me in our relationship, simply judging based on the way he already treated me every day verbally, and the fact he’d deck his own fucking sister in the face over a phone charger being misplaced.

A series of things happened and I eventually ended the relationship, finally, with a proud “fuck you”. He was not having it. He harassed me every single day. I changed my phone number. He then emailed me. I don’t know how he got my email but he did. He emailed me photos of himself with presents he got me that he asked permission to send me. I never responded. He won a championship belt at a boxing tournament and told me he did it for me. I never responded. He eventually gave up with the emails.

We had a mutual friend, though, and every day he’d cry to her and try to get her to help him get me back. She tried to talk some sense into him and tell him it was never going to happen, but he wouldn’t hear it. He went to college in Boston and the Boston Bombing happened down the street from his university. I called him with my number blocked just to make sure he was okay, and also to give him proper closure. I felt really guilty about him being so depressed about the relationship ending and he wasn’t moving on at all, so I wanted to just solidify things and let him heal. He told me he was fine and said he had to go, and that was it. He hung up. So he never got that closure from me that day.

A couple years went by though and he seemed a lot better, from what I gathered, and he asked our friend if he could get my number from her just to catch up and see how I was doing. He wanted to repair everything and just be friends. We were both adults at that point, I was 19 at the time, in college, we’d had other relationships (though he lied and told me he hadn’t? Don’t understand why), etc. So I just said that was fine. She gave him my number and he called me, and we talked like normal. Everything seemed okay, he asked what I was doing in school, I told him. He asked what school I went to. I told him. He asked where I lived. I told him. If you’re not catching on by now, to spell it out, I was pretty fucking stupid on this phone call. But I thought he’d grown up and left all those old feelings behind by now, so I could freely let him know these things. I had zero red flags, until he asked me if I’d been with anyone else after him. I said yes. He asked me if I loved that person. I said yes. He didn’t say anything for a minute. Red flag number one. He told me at the beginning of the call that it wouldn’t be about the romantic relationship at all, but now asked me if we would ever be together again. Red flag number two. I told him no. He told me something like, “Look, I know that guy broke your heart, but you don’t need to completely turn off to guys. I’m not the same as I used to be, it would work this time.” Another red flag. I said I did not want to be with him, ever again. This was never going to happen again. I took this time to give him proper closure directly from me, and not our mutual friend. I repeated, this is NEVER going to happen again. He said, “You can’t say never, you don’t know what the future holds! I told you I’m not the same, why wouldn’t you give it a chance? Because of that fucking guy?” More red flags, everywhere. He just kept rambling, kept saying “that fucking guy”, pertaining to the guy I dated after him. Saying “Let me buy a flight and come take you out to coffee. It’s bullshit you’re saying you don’t want this, all over that fucking guy.” Any time I would repeat “I do *not* want you in this way,” he’d say “Right, you want that fucking guy.” He was so, so mad about “that fucking guy”. Once he knew about him that’s all he went on about. Like *”If I can’t have you, he can’t either.”* That is the vibe I got. He’d always been super possessive, but I’d never felt so, like.....suffocated before. He’d always been controlling, but even in a 15 minute phone call, from halfway across the US, I felt like his hand was around my fucking throat, and that he was telling me I shouldn’t have been with anyone after him, I shouldn’t have loved anyone after him, I shouldn’t be telling him never because how can I know the future, and the only acceptable future is us.

He asked me to FaceTime him and I told him no. I hung up on him, blocked his number, and he surprisingly respected that and never asked our friend to persuade me to let him call back. I didn’t change my phone number. But I was suddenly terrified, this guy was well-off money-wise, could hop on a flight on a whim, was extremely possessive of me, and this motherfucker knew where I lived. He knew where I attended college. I did not feel safe. Every day I walked around campus extra aware of my surroundings, hoping I wouldn’t see him randomly. Every break from university when I’d go home I’d make sure I locked my car so he wouldn’t show up and hide out in there, I’d make sure every door of my house was locked at all times. Maybe I was being extra, but I was terrified to fucking live now that he knew where I was.

A couple *more* years later, I see I have a friend request on Facebook from someone I don’t recognize the name of, and the picture is some random quote from the internet, but he’s got all the same friends I and our mutual friend have, aka everyone we ever went to high school with, everyone in our hometown. I never accept requests from people I don’t know, so I deleted that, but I remember it. A week or so later I got a message from our mutual friend saying it’s an emergency, my ex is reaching out to her, trying to get to me, and he is pissed. It was this account that I didn’t accept, he was using a fake name. I absolutely did not want to speak to him, but he blackmailed me. Our mutual friend was in a fling with his best friend at the same time that we were dating, and she sent that friend a nude photo of her, with her face in it, which that friend shared with my ex. They were 16 at the time. My ex had all our hometown friends added on Facebook, and was going to send the photo to every single person if I didn’t speak to him. She still lived there, she worked in a busy place where everyone came, and she’d have had to move towns because of the embarrassment if I didn’t comply. I had to do it. I spoke to him and I still have all the screenshots of the days of conversation. I have screenshots of his fake Facebook page, and back in the day when we were younger I had another account that I just forgot the login to. Nothing was private on it, so I could see the old friends list and it had his real account in it. I took screenshots of that too for proof that it was the same person.

Anyway, I spoke to him, I asked him what the fuck he wanted. He told me, “I want to ruin your life. I’m *going* to ruin your fucking life.” At this point it was, what, four years after we dated? This was last year, I was 21. Four years. He’d gone through all the stages of grief I guess and was still bouncing around in them. He was on extreme anger now. He didn’t ask to get back together when we spoke, so I really don’t know *what* exactly he wanted out of this from me, and I don’t want to reread those messages to analyze it all, but I just continued to take screenshots of everything as it happened. He was calling me a slut for being with someone after him, telling me I’m a worthless whore for moving on. He wanted me to realize I fucked up, and that now my life would be ruined because of it. Let me take a second here to really focus on that, because that first part is something you mentioned in your post. I’ll get to how this all relates to you in a minute, but remember, he wanted me to realize I fucked up. How did I fuck up? I don’t know, but he wanted me to realize I fucked up. The first day we spoke it seemed like I kind of “talked him down” and he was more chilled out, but then the next day he told our friend and I that he had a surprise for us. He’d initially said he wouldn’t release the picture of her publicly, but then he made an event on Facebook set to go off at like 3am or something in a couple days. I screenshot that too. He was going to release her picture, and also recordings of me that he never told me about, of all the times I’d climaxed during phone sex. He’d always made me let him know when I was about to cum, and that’s why, I guess. So he could press record. I never consented to that. But he was going to release all of those and my friend’s picture to the public at a set time. She got angry because he promised her he wouldn’t, and when she spoke to him about this he told her not to worry, it wasn’t her he was after. So basically he was fucking with me trying to get me emotionally freaked out for some reason. For what, I still don’t know. I didn’t give it a chance to get to the reason, because I called his local police and then he fled the country. All those screenshots helped me greatly.

They called his home first, which they shouldn’t have done because that warned him that they knew. They should’ve just gone there first but they didn’t. But they did go there when he didn’t return their calls, and he was already gone, but everything was left there. Phone, laptop still open on the bed, everything was left in a hurry. I was working with two men, both extremely, extremely concerned for me and supportive, a detective and an officer. I was always kept in the loop, every single day, via phone and email. He eventually came back to the US and he was immediately found and handcuffed at the airport and taken to the police station. They asked me what I wanted to do with him, and in short, he’s now been tried and convicted for possession of child pornography (my friend’s photo only, as audio recordings aren’t illegal in Massachusetts) and criminal harassment. I also requested that he undergo a series of mental evaluations. He was also put on a probationary period. I also put a permanent restraining order on him, no expiration date, valid in all 50 states. The people helping me with all the court stuff wanted me to be there, because that would’ve more likely secured his convictions, but I was too terrified for him to know what I look like as a more mature version of myself, that’s why I didn’t FaceTime him when he asked two years ago. I didn’t like that he knew where I lived, but I don’t look the same as I did four years ago, I didn’t want him to be able to put an accurate face to me. I declined to go, but luckily he was still convicted of all charges without me there. If he ever contacts me again, I am to contact his probation officers and he will be served a punishment.

It’s been a year and he’s not contacted me again. But that doesn’t make me comfortable, because before that it had been two years since we spoke on the phone. And before that it had been two more years since we spoke at all, when I ended the relationship. And he seems to only get more psychotic with time away from me.

**How this relates to you:**
I am begging you, seriously begging you, to see it from this side. I put a restraining order on someone that I at one point loved very much. That is not something someone just does for the hell of it. She had her reason for doing it, whether you agree with it or even see it at all. No one would just slap a restraining order on someone for no reason, or because you hang out too much. She felt unsafe. You threatened her. You asked her “why didn’t you open the door”. You were fucking with her, but he was just fucking with me, too. But how am I supposed to know, how is your friend supposed to know, that that’s all it’ll be? How are we supposed to know you DIDN’T show up at our place and we didn’t open the door? How are we supposed to know you wouldn’t do that in the future? Do you understand how fucking miserable of a life it is to live like that every day? Wondering if you’re fucking safe? Wondering if he fucking knows where I am? He said he wanted to ruin my life. My most recent ex went to Boston a while back, in this crazy ex’s state of Massachusetts, and I was scared for him. I was scared for him! Because he was extremely (in my opinion) transparent on Facebook about where he was, who he was affiliated with, and we were transparent about being known publicly as a couple, and I was terrified my crazy ex would know he was there, know he was my boyfriend, and do something dangerous. Do you understand how miserable it is to live every day being afraid not only for yourself but for whoever you love next? It doesn’t matter if you don’t understand *why* she feels this way. SHE FEELS THIS WAY BECAUSE OF YOU. That’s it, plain and simple. You made her feel this way, she is afraid of you. That is why there is a restraining order against you.

But you know this. You said yourself, she’s miserable and living in fear, and she shouldn’t be, it’s a false image of you that just isn’t true, you’re not this scary guy. So the reason you keep contacting her is to let her know, *hey, I’m not this scary guy. You can talk to me, I won’t hurt you.* Buddy I understand 100% where you’re coming from mentally, but that isn’t how you go about it. I understand that you said “why didn’t you open the door” out of anger and resentment towards her for cutting you off, but repeatedly contacting her to “reassure” her you’re not actually out to get her is not how you go about it. Like I said, my ex was extremely angry with me even years later for ending things and being with someone else. He was always upset that I ended things, but the first time he actually got angry about it and threatened my life was when he knew I’d been with someone else since him. He was angry. This angry person isn’t who he was round the clock, at least not to that extent. He was angry at that time, and he said those things to me. You were angry at that time, and you said those things to her. In my case, because I know this person personally and I know him to be truly fucking psychotic, that angry and threatening state defines him as a whole for me. In your case, I can’t say that. I don’t know you. I hope you’re not a psychotic fuck, but you may be. You may not be. I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say those things you said in that angry state don’t define you as a whole. That being said, however, you need to leave her alone.

I saw your post in the confession sub, but what really pushed me to write this to you was part of a comment of yours on your original post in the relationship advice sub: “My life doesn’t continue without her.” It’s taken out of context, but the context was that you can’t make friends with the conscience knowing your prior best friend has a restraining order on you, therefore you must settle this first, once and for all, and then you can finally lay it to rest and move on. Again, that is *not* the way to go about it. I cannot stress enough that this is not about you, dude. This isn’t about what you want, or what you think is right, or what you think needs fixing, or if you think she’s got the wrong impression of you entirely even. She made the decision to get a restraining order because she felt like she was in danger with you. You gave her that impression, whether you meant it or not. She *is* living in fear, let me tell you, she definitely is, but you know what? She’ll move past this. If you leave her alone, she will move past this. The more you contact her, the fucking scarier it is, mate. The more she feels unsafe, the more she feels she can’t get away from you, the more afraid of *you* she is. You aren’t fixing it. You are making it worse.

What I mentioned before, that he wanted to make me realize I fucked up. You’re doing the same. You wanted to make her realize she fucked up, and so you fucked with her and threatened her. You felt bad for that, that’s not you, you were just upset. So now you want to keep contacting her, to let her know you’re not a bad guy, to make her realize it’s a misunderstanding. She doesn’t need to realize it. Leave. Her. Alone. That is the best thing for everyone. Leave her alone. Please. This type of situation is absolutely terrifying, like I said I’ll go into more detail in my own separate post, but I can at least tell you that this type of situation you’ve put her in is absolutely terrifying to live with. Please, let her fucking rest. I know you just want to clear the air, clean up the damage and move on happily, your intentions are great, but that’s not what you’re actually doing. Please. Just leave her alone and move on without contact. She will be fine. And as I said, I feel you *were* in an angry state and that you truly just want to apologize genuinely and tidy things up, so you should move on without guilt or a heavy conscience as well. She will be fine, and you will be fine, if you just let this be.

I’m begging you friend, as shitty a situation as this is, as sad as it is for you to lose a good friend, please just let this be and move on. Everything will be fine if you just do that. She didn’t put a lifetime restraining order on you, so if she reaches out to you **ON HER OWN ACCORD** in a year, then that’s her decision, but until then, her decision is to be left alone. You don’t have to understand it, but you have to abide by it. If not out of respect for her, then at least out of the rule of the law. Literally. You’ll serve jail time if she reports this contact. It doesn’t matter if you weren’t being harmful, you are not to contact her in this time. It is in your best interest, as well as hers, but especially yours, to leave this be.

Again, in summary, aka **TL;DR:** /u/throwahoyway, I’m tagging you. Read this. From her perspective, this is a horrifying life to live at the moment. It doesn’t matter if you understand why, or agree with the image she has of you. Your actions have lead to it, and you need to accept it. Leave her alone during this time, please. You are scaring her every time you contact her. No one wants to live like this. Your intentions are good, I know, but it doesn’t matter. Please leave this girl alone.

76,"I don't know when life started being like this but everything I do has never been for myself. I've always worked to help and satisfy others. It always seems like I am willing to sacrifice so much more for others. However, I can never seem to satisfy myself or even find something that motivates me personally. If I knew people wouldn't be hurt if I were to die, then I'd see no purpose in living. I just don't want to put that burden on them so I continue to live. I feel this is a flawed way of thinking but it's what I've become. Thoughts?",13Dec2017,10
77,"Most words are not stored in our brain as words. They're stored as very small pieces of information, probably in individual neurons. If you hear ""lion"", different things come to mind right? You might see a lion in your mind's eye, and you're aware of it being a cat, dangerous, being in Africa, etc. A word just connects information that's grouped together in your brain and makes some of the connections stronger in a main group. It doesn't just connect the main group, either, it connects the information connected to the main group to a lesser extent, with varying strengths. The strength of the main group's connections varies as well. When you connect words into sentences, you are connecting two sets of information together but also changing the strength of the connections in their structure. If you have multiple words together, the information they have in common will be connected, even if that's not the main meaning. That means there are more groups of higher connection than you are aware of. Groups of high connections could also be called ""meanings"". Question words, prepositions, articles, etc, tell your brain how to structure the connections (because there are different ways it can be connected). So a sentence is information structured and connected together for a coherent meaning. But if you hear a sentence, other information than the coherent meaning gets connected and you don't know it. This effects your thinking because you don't actually think with your consciousness. Consciousness is just you being aware of some of your unconscious brain activity. And you don't think in words either. You just think you do because the unconscious brain's activity gets converted into words. But it's just an approximation of your unconscious, the closest words for the information, and it's only some of the activity and probably only a small amount of it.

So with that said, advertising slogans take advantage of this by using words that trigger information that are associated with emotion or ideas that will make you want to buy the product. Because you connect the slogan with their product, so the information it triggers is then connected with the product.

I'll use an example.

""Choosy mom"" on its face, means a mother who is choosy, takes to long to choose, over perfectionist. But that isn't all that gets connected.

""Choosy"" - connects making a decision needing to making the correct decision to a negative connotation. For ""Mom"" the main information connected would be different for every person, but that mothers are responsible for the welfare of their children, should benefit their children, and make the right choice for them are connected to the main group. Putting choosy, that has ""making the correct choice"" connected and emphasized very strongly before Mom makes connections with ""making the correct choice"" which is connected with the welfare of the children. It also might lower the strength of the connections with the negative connotation. So the third group of strong connection in ""choosy mom"" has to do with the welfare of the children and making the correct choice. Putting choose after this makes this third group even stronger through the ""correct decision"" piece of information and deemphasizes the negative connotation even more. Then they connect their product to this. You connect the slogan with the product very strongly, so when you're in the grocery store and are choosing between jif and another brand of peanut butter seeing jif triggers the slogan's set of connections, even if you don't know it. You are aware that you're making a choice, which means the connections having to do with choice already activated to some extent. The set of connections having to do with choice and your child's welfare effects your unconscious processing and makes it more likely you'll choose their product.",13Dec2017,1
