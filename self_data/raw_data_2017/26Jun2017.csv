1,"I know it is unwise to put negative thoughts to paper, as they are prone to pass. However, tonight I can not seem to dissuade myself. Often I have thought of social anxiety as being trapped in some kind of bubble, unable to communicate with the outside world. As of late, I increasingly feel like I am living outside of the bubble, and everybody else is inside. They smile and visit with each other with joyous abandon, and every day is a day of community and conversation and sharing. I feel that I am positioned outside of this bubble. My dearest friends are now scattered, as I always feared they would be. My girlfriend is away, and every day I fear more for my future while she is in it, not for any fault of her’s. The issue lies with me, within me. This encroaching blackness that envelops every inch of me is beyond any horror I can imagine. How cruel is a sickness that it makes death seem sweeter than any present state?
 
I can recall the events of the last day with striking clarity, because it was a great day by any measure. But tonight, I am empty once again. I met energetic, young people. It was a joy to simply be near them and hear what trivial things they might discuss. I felt like a dog beside the dinner table, ears perked up at the slightest sounds, ever awaiting the next moment. I chanced upon them, and spent the day with them. Yet now I feel once again on the outside peering in. Every second I imagine absurd, distasteful things they might say about me now that I’ve gone. This is assuredly a farce, but then it is called an illness for a reason. Though I know she is an irrational muse, she still has my ear. I periodically write a message in the group chat they invited me to, so as to show interest of some sort. But my world is not theirs. Theirs is not mine. It was as though we were merely two ships in an endless sea who spied the other cresting a wave. Both crews came out and cheered and waved and then they were gone. Lost to the sea, and I was alone once more. 
 
Every waking moment since has been spent imagining a life without this city, without this girl, without me as I am. How many wonderful things could have been had I chosen a different path? How many connections and bonds would be broken or replaced by other bonds, strength aside? Even now I frantically check my phone, hoping that my image has infected someone’s fleeting thoughts, and found its way into their consciousness. They might pick up their phone and send me a message, inviting me around. Instead I am left to imagine the opposite. That I was there and I am now forgotten. What felt to me a momentous occasion to those joyful people in their bubble was just part of their everyday nonsense. I was a passing thought.
 
The crux of the issue is that I desire drastic change. A separation from my present reality, and yet I feel that I lack the means to take such measures. I am an aged tree, thoroughly rooted to the Earth. I have obligations, both financial and emotional. I have a cat to care for, loans to pay, a lease recently signed which must be paid monthly. I have a girlfriend for whom I harbour the deepest affections, and yet each day all I want is to be on the side of the world opposite her. This is not her fault, of course. It’s the disease. That sickness of my mind which tortures me with the most violent and dark interpretations of coming events. That sickness which dictates unendingly in my skull the deaths of all those I love, and how these events transpire the moment my loves leave my presence. Nothing can stop this demonic fixation save for medicines, and even then it is merely delayed until the waking hours. I beg of any God who can hear me: end my life or end my suffering; whichever comes fastest.

* We elect shitty leaders too much. W Bush (×2), Trump

* Even if we do have a decent president, we can still have shitty congressmen that deadlock everything

* We **tried** to fix healthcare with Obamacare, but that failed.

* I don't want to live in a country that people like to laugh at

4," Just bursting with gratitude and need to share. Earlier tonight my mother let one of our cats  outside. She has Alzheimer's and we've done everything possible to try and prevent this exact thing. Brand new deadbolts on the doors, juryrigging locks for the window screens, etc. But in the end it was human error and somehow the backdoor was left unlocked. I walked around the neighborhood for three hours shaking a bag of treats and scaring the neighbors by creeping around their yards with a flashlight. Finally I went home and prepared to spend the night outside. I was a sobbing MESS by that point. I was still hyperventilating an hour later when I felt a nudge against my leg. 

My smart, smart boy came home on his own! He's a little dirty and his paws are sore, but overall he's no worse for wear.  Finally I can take a deep breath and stop contemplating murdering my mom (yes, I know it wasn't her fault.)

I'm just so very relieved right now. ",26Jun2017,20
6,"People treat you *far* differently when you look like you're a very capable human being.  I'm getting far more attention from people in general, it's been nice but at the same time, now that I know how ""alive"" the world is when you look like this, I'm really afraid of getting busy and not being able to do as much upkeep, so losing just enough that I fall back into ""invisible land"" again.  Or at least ""not as attractive to get this much attention"" land.

It's one thing to guess the other side exists, a lot of people deny it and when you have never experienced it it's easy to think it's just something that maybe isn't real.  But having *known* it now... I really can't go back.  So this has been a benefit in a way, but at the same time it's raised the stakes on life and I would say I have a weird anxiety about it now.  Before I was anxious because I considered myself a loser, even though I made money just because of the way people treated me.  Then you look good and it totally changes... I know I've probably said this a few times already but it really does bear repeating, it's like all these doors that were previously locked magically unlock, and not only that, but other people swing them open for you, like they think you know something they don't or just by being around you they feel good so they want you to be aware of them.

I really don't know.  Before I was depressed by the isolation.  Now I'm depressed knowing people really are this shallow, but I don't want to leave it.  I really don't think I can sustain this though.  That's the fear.  It was pretty slow in the buildup to summer and it's pretty much dead now and will be all summer, so I've been able to have a lot more energy banked and more free time (I'm in a position where I can leave if I know there isn't a lot to do, it's pretty independent, as long as I don't dig myself a hole I don't get in trouble) to get this good.  But it won't last, I am really afraid of what I might do when I lose it.  Absolutely *everything* about my life is better, not just the people thing, but the way I feel, sex drive, mood (aside from this fear), appetite, sleep, life actually feels really good.  I don't think I can go back.  It'll happen by force, life circumstance, I'll get busy again, but I don't think I can go back.",26Jun2017,3

I take a sip to remember the days

Another to forget about mine

A swig to level the emotions

Another to block negativity

Let me be me

Thoughtful, loving, emotional, passionate

Let me be me

Quiet, trained, groomed, masked

Stay within the lines

10,"The ones from 1932 to 1935 are the best in terms of gag quality and animation quality, a very nice balance is struck.  The animators where just so dang creative.  some many pointless gags and little details that made the show great.  


The ones from 1930 and 1931 has lots of great gags but the animation is kind of bad in the early ones so many of the gags don't read.  

Around 1937 something happened to the show where it lost the plot so to speak.  The animation is a lot tighter and the stories generally have a beginning middle and end but they lack the soul.  This is because Betty was original a flapper but by the late 30's flappers where so 1920 so they turned her into a sort of ""spinster/career woman"" (the was on wikipedia).  The other problem with these is Betty's world is 100% human by this point.  Originally Betty was a dog, only for the first couple years tho.  From then on she became a human but lives in a word of animals and people.  She used to have a sidekick/best friend named Bimbo and there was a clown named Koko.  Also towards the end of the show Betty is no longer sexy.  It is weird that she is sexy at all considering her head looks like a sack of flour.  The changed her to be lame because of decency laws in the late 30's.  All that ""won't somebody think of children"" bother.

11,"Don't get me wrong she's a great woman with a big heart. Smart, goal oriented, the works. She's just never been into having sex. I'm the only man she's ever been with but doing that took 8 months. We've also ran into having to cooperate with distance for a year now, she's been in Boston and im in Missouri. I've visited her a few times and it was great. She'll be back this weekend for good and she just told me I have to wait even more so she can get used to having the idea of having sex on a usual basis. She's about to move in and I'm worried mostly because I fear I will resent her for not putting out. I mean I put my own needs aside for her for over a year and now she's telling me I have to wait even more. Her telling me that she needs to prepare herself mentally just gave me this gust twisting feeling that just the idea of having sex with me disgusts her. I've done everything for this woman and treated her like how most woman want to be treated. I've always put her needs before mind and now just having to endure a whole year alone with no sex just to be told to wait even more while she's here just feels like the ultimate gut punch. I want to tell her how I feel but as soon as I do she'll feel bad and now I'm the bad guy. I want to tell her that it would be a better idea for her to wait to move in but I'm afraid how all that would turn out specially since she could've stayed in Boston and started her life over there.

14,"But I can't find love if I don't love myself, is that what they say? I don't know why, but sometimes I hate myself so, so much. Sometimes I look in the mirror and think, oh, my skin is too dark, my breasts are too small, the bags under my eyes are getting worse from constant lack of sleep, my knees are weird, my feet look manly. I keep forgetting how my hair looks nice, or how I'm in shape and how I maintain it that way, or how I can actually look cute from time to time. It's easier to remember what I lack. 

&amp;nbsp;

This kind of self-hatred goes past my skin, too. I think about how childish and fickle I can be, but don't remember that my child-like personality can make people happy, when presented at the right time and place, of course. I remember things like times where I said mean or hurtful things to people I care about, and I uselessly hate myself all over again. I tell myself that I'm an awful person and I don't deserve any of these people in my life and that they'd be better off without me. I never remember times where maybe I helped or entertained them. If my family and friends keep talking to me and keep inviting me to do stuff with them, doesn't that mean my presence is valued in some way? But somehow, I manage to forget sometimes. I think about all the cringey things I did when I was a bit younger and it keeps me up at night, and then think that no one would ever want to be with someone like me. 

&amp;nbsp;

And when I'm stuck on that train of self-loathing, I spend the whole day, sporadically crying and being minimally productive, and I can't sleep at night and sometimes I even hurt myself. A few weeks ago, for punishment for crying in public, I took the stick that turns the blinds from my bedroom window and whipped my legs with it. My sister found out when she noticed that I suddenly wore long pants even though summers get really hot here, where I live. I always wear shorts in this kind of weather, but I didn't think anyone would notice or care. She rarely cries, but this time her eyes watered when she saw the injuries and said, ""What if I did that? How would you feel?"" I understood, and since then I stopped. I might hate myself sometimes but I always care about my sister, so if not for my sake, I'll stop hurting myself for hers. You should see my handiwork, though. I admire my resistance and fortitude. One of the lashes left a long, internal scar on my leg. I was strong. The pain felt good. Is fortitude a weird word? I'm so afraid of sounding ""/r/iamverysmart""ish, but I don't know how else to express that idea. I'm worried that maybe my weird word choices push people away. 

&amp;nbsp;

Okay, so maybe, by some miracle, my weirdness *didn't* alienate my family or friends, but what about...? What about a romantic partner? I've had a few, short relationships before, and only one semi-serious one. I wonder if somewhere out there, there's a decent guy who will be okay with someone like me? I wonder if he'd be okay with me crying all the time, and my lack of decent cleavage, and my tendency to change my mind a lot. I wonder if he'd be okay with my weirdness. That one time I thought I found that guy, even though sometimes I don't have much of a self-esteem, I eventually figured out the name-calling, guilt tripping, and empty threats isn't normal behavior. So I walked out the door. I'm young, so I have time, but right now, it's hard to imagine that anyone could look at me and want me in their long-term future. ",26Jun2017,9

Now, we continued making eye contact a few times, each time followed by either me or her looking away very quickly. Foolish of me...

Anyway, I had made up my mind about asking her number, what to say and when to. She was standing with her friends, and I walked to my locker. I have reasons to believe she saw me, as she looked right before I started walking. I was alone at my locker when she kneeled down behind me, our backs facing each other. Her locker was there, and she was there. Alone.

I knew, this was my chance, and I had all the reasons to believe she did this on purpose, she helped me create a chance.

Our original plan was to leave the four support pillars alone ... they were nicely clad and we were just going to strip them and repaint. However, once we got the trim off, it became apparent that each of these ""support"" posts are hollow ... they are basically boxes made from 3/4 inch panel, and there is no 4X4 inside the box! Further more, each of the pillars is mounted on top of the (rotting) decking, not on the support structure below.


We have been in the house for 20 years; there has been no movement of the porch roof and it is still nice and straight.


Apparently at least one other person has posted online (not Reddit) about this ... https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/any-carpenters-handypeople-porch-column-question.2243879/ ... but didn't seem to get any real answers (back in 2012).


Now planning to replace each of these posts, maybe by popping off one side of these pillars and inserting a 4X4, if I can do that without wrecking the wood. Otherwise just trash them and replace?
I am kind of blown away that these pillars supported a roof for this long (the house is &gt;100 years old, and the pillars are at least 20, probably more like 40 years old). I am also totally surprised anyone would put them up this way! Is this a legitimate form of structural support that I am just not familiar with? Or did we just get really lucky?

29,"So i'm taking a class for the summer (i'm in uni) and since it's summer session, it's quite short and fast paced so I decided to record the lectures with my phone. There is a no phone usage policy for the class but the professor did mention in the beginning that we are allowed to record her lectures with our phones. What she failed to mention or maybe I just didn't hear correctly ( I didn't record during the first day) is that we need to request her permission prior to recording class lectures. She tends to walk around during class and so i'm sure that she's seen my phone out on numerous occasions, I usually place it on the upper right hand corner of my desk and let it do it's thing and record, never touching it or misusing it (social media, texting, etc.). I started to feel super paranoid this weekend as the class is coming to an end soon and I feel my professor might be misinterpreting my phone being out with me defying her class policy so I emailed her. In the email I explained how I've been using my phone exclusively for recording lectures and how I would be deleting the recordings at the end of the course. I expressed concern/worry about being penalized due to a misunderstanding about this situation. She responded two days later saying that I should have asked for permission first and to please do so in the future, she also thanked me for letting her know. What does this mean? Do you guys think I will be penalized? The syllabus says any violations of classroom policies will result in a two letter grade drop. I currently have a B+ in the class, i've worked really hard to achieve this, I also have perfect attendance and pay close attention during class lectures.

33,"I'm not quite sure if this is the right place to post this but well... I also don't really know if I can explain it correctly so that someone can understand it. I just wanted to talk about it because it really bothers me atm. 


I just feel like a lot of stuff that I once liked to do or that I normally like to do feels like work. In some case. For expample: When I was younger I read a lot. I'm part of this Harry Potter Generation and I remember when a new HP book came out, I bought it immediately and completely lost myself in it for days. I couldn't stop reading until I finished it. Nowadays... I still buy a lot of boks and maybe that could be part of the problem. I have 3 piles of books next to my bed, I „read“ about 5 books at the moment, but … I'm just not able to sit down and really focus on this one book. Maybe I'm able to read about 10 pages and that's really a success for me, then I put the book down. My mind just wanders somewhere else while reading... and then I look at all the books around me and think „When the hell shall I be able to read all of this?“ I have a wishlist of ~500books on amazon. I guess I might need 3 lives to read all of this. And then I get sad because I know this isn't gonna happen. There's one book that I guess I really like but I started reading it nearly about 2 years ago and still haven't finished it! 


Same thing with movies or series. I have a pile of movies at home but everytime I look at it it's like „Man, that are a lot of movies... when should I watch all of them?“ What happens then is that I don't watch any of it and they just lie there. Or when I try to do it takes a lot of time... why? A big part of my problem is my concentration. When I do something it doesn't take much time that I lose interest in it or that my thoughts go somewhere else. Of couse then I don't notice what's happening on the screen and I have to rewind or to stop the tv for a moment. This leads to the fact that sometimes a movie that is about 2 hours long can take me 4 hours to watch it. Madness. I know. :( And don't talk to me about Netflix. My list there is soooo long.... another thing that makes me sad. I once made a list (something I really like to do, making lists for everything) for the average length of an episode of a series on my netflix list. Just to see if there are any shows that I'm maybe able to watch. Of course if an average episode lasts about 1 hour it makes me desperate again. Then I guess that I won't watch that show. Maybe if an episode is 20-30min long I'm able to see it, to „achieve“ something. To get it off my list. I guess then it doesn't feel like I watch this series for fun or because I'm interested in it but rather because I wanna finish it, you know? To get it off my list. 


It just makes me sad and desperate and well ... I don't feel like doing anything because I know that I'm ""not able"" to do it. To read a book, to watch a movie or other stuff that I once liked doing. 

I guess I could go on but this post is already long enough and I'm not sure if anybody will read it.

I don't expect any sympathy, but I felt the need to vent and maybe share that moderate success in life doesn't equate to happiness.

Hopefully this doesn't come across as a humble-brag either because I sincerely hate life right now and the only thing that's keeping me going is knowing my kids and wife would be miserable if something were to happen to me. ",26Jun2017,5
