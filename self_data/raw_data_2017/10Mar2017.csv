0,"Sometimes I feel like I'm spectating the world around me, I'm watching it play out, like I'm a wildlife documentarian, who gets told not to interfere with the local wildlife, lest he change the outcome. Similarly, I feel like I have not had any severe or major dent on the world, no dent at all, and that I have been spectating and observing other people participating the world.

But the strange thing is, I'm not sad about this, I'm not upset. As a matter of fact, I rather enjoy watching people. I enjoy watching them fight, watching them talk, watching them do things, because it really does remind me that nature is beautiful, and that there is a certain harmony that connects every man to another.

To my ex girlfriend. To a lot of people. Everyone now sees me as a creepy bully for something that I did a year ago. I'm not that person anymore. But apparently that's what everybody sees me as now. She's too powerful. I can't tell the teachers or the counselors. They're on her side. I'll just get in trouble. My parents can't do much either. She has the police on her side as well.

3,"I didn't have a chance to ask the person who said this, but she wasn't the first to say something like this to me.

She said I had a good energy about me and that I gave off this light.

I've been told I give off good vibes and stuff before and people saying there's something special about me (special ed maybe?) (Jk lol) and I want answers before I develop a God complex haha.

People always seem drawn to me, which is odd because I'm a strong introvert. Always saying hi or talking to me. I don't think I appear that inviting.

People seem to be comfortable in silence with me, even if we just met.

And it gets crazier (brace yourselves). I'm not saying I'm psychic, but I've definitely had dreams about things and later experienced those dreams in real life.

I usually predict peoples actions with a 99% accuracy. There's no way this shit can be coincidence, can it? Logic tells me it is. Maybe I'm just a good guesser.

But what I want an answer on, I guess, is whether or not my fellow redditors believe humans can feel one another's energy. And, what is meant when people say I give off a light, good energy, and something special about me. Or, gas up my mind so I can transcend into the heavens.

But seriously, I think of myself as a normal guy, but other people seem to notice something I don't.

It might be wise to mention these are ""normal"" people who don't necessarily buy into the whole human energy thing or ""auras"" and ""chi"". Some of them do though.

I'm starting to think I'm some chosen existence taken human form that will one day save the world.

4,"So there is this family owned yogurt shop near where I live. It used to be the hang out spot for all my pals when I was still in highschool. Recently they have had a change in ownership and the new owners are pretty bad. They leave toppings in open containers despite knowing that is against health code, they changed the old ""buy one get one free Tuesdays"" to buy one get one half off. They stopped scheduling the old staff of friendly faces so they could have their 14 yr old kids work there instead. And they are never in stock because they cannot order product right, these were never problems under the old management.

My friend works there and is getting no hours due to that previously mentioned problem, but the owners still have the nerve to ask her to change my ""slanderous"" review. There is nothing in my google account that links back to my friend, so the only way they could have made that connection was to do some cyber stalking. I feel uncomfortable that a business would go to those lengths to avoid negative review scores that they CLEARLY deserve.

So the question is what do I do now? I live in a right to work state so there is really nothing to prevent them from firing my friend over something stupid like this. And I genuinely just feel like the company should not be doing this? Is that considered ethical in the business setting and if not is there a place to report it?

12,"almost two years ago now I moved away from a great job and out of a new state I had moved to because I was scared to live there without my roommate and best friend (he was abandoning our lease and taking an almost 20k/yr pay cut to get back with an ex-girlfriend). I went back to school when I moved home and I've done pretty well. This is my last semester before my degree and certification testing. I have a couple of part time sporadic jobs keeping me afloat.

 the problems started with my dad borrowing (putting a whopping 9k miles over a few months on it) and damaging my car, costing me about 2k to fix. I had some relationship problems soon after moving home, a girl I have a strong connection with moved away for work as I moved here... we had been feeling out a serious relationship and suddenly it went up in smoke. the lack of direction in life (despite me doing well in school and knowing I'm on track to improving my life tenfold by graduating) has just been devastating self esteem wise. I hadn't ever been not working full-time since I was 17. The feeling of listlessness and lack of money has been rough. I've been exiling myself from friend groups. I had always been skinny (chronic runner and picky eater) but in my new state I had started working out and eating really well for the first time ever, but since moving home I've lost 20 pounds and look like a skeleton again. My hairline has dropped back. I turned 26, so I don't have insurance anymore (working on trying to get ACA coverage but who knows how long that will last). I've been mean to people, getting in arguments and picking fights for no reason with people I care about. I haven't really hung out with my best friend because I can't forgive him for breaking our lease. On top of that last week in my spiral of destruction the person who was my '2nd best friend' (who has been there for me through most of this stuff) and I got into an argument and I removed her from my life completely. Halfway through last semester my mother was diagnosed with HUR2 breast cancer which has a crazy re-occurrence rate, and she originally was going to refuse chemo/radiation. So I missed a ton of school taking her to appointments and such, each one ending with a doctor recommending she started chemo last week. 

My cat I've had since 7th grade passed away in the middle of this, that was really rough on me. Then I tried to date a friend and it ended poorly, with her almost breaking up with a boyfriend for me but then I luckily I finally felt guilty and just dealt with it by not talking to her at all. When I don't have class I sit around reading, watching netflix or playing video games- but only when I'm not helping my mom vacuum her hair off the bathroom floor or empty her puke buckets (she's allergic to the usual anti-nauseates) who's 2 months into chemo now (my dad doesn't have any vacations days anymore so I'm the only one around to help her). I've watched the office 1.5 times inside of 2017 already, which is just surreal to say outloud. I got to sleep at 4am and wake up at 2pm. I can't motivate myself to even do school work lately, that's the scary part. I'm at the finish line, my new career and chance to start adulthood is right there and I've just stopped. On top of this I'm having mortality panic attacks in the middle of the night, can't stop thinking about death. Last week a girl I used to date moved back home and we went out for drinks a couple times and at the end of the last time she wanted to sleep with me and I TURNED HER DOWN. I've always had feelings for her, and I just watched myself from a third person view coldly reject her advance and not give a reason. In the shower each morning my brain is screaming ""What's happening to me!?!?!?"" I see myself doing these all these destructive things, I hear myself picking fights with people I care about and just watch it unfold. I keep going to bed planning on tomorrow being the day I turn it around but it never happens. At first I thought it was laziness or procrastination, but I've realized it's not work most of the time- it's things I enjoy, things I've never had problems motivating or prioritizing. I'm so worried I'm going to continue down this path to a point of no return and ruin the path of life I had all but secured until a year ago. I'm about two or three weeks behind on school now, tomorrow I'm going to write an email to my professors explaining I'm taking care of my mother and use that to ask for some mercy grade-wise, I know that's wrong but I feel like explaining this whole spiral won't do anything to help me besides maybe a psychologist recommendation from the college. 

I don't know what I expect from anyone reading this, I don't know if advice over the internet can fix this. It's scary to me that there's a 'spectator-me' watching this stuff happening and knowing it's bad... but nothing is getting fixed. It's just getting worse.  ",10Mar2017,7
16,"Small epiphany.. but I've lived in San Diego all my life and I love accents, but I don't think I have much affectation to how I talk. Sure, I say shit like ""oh, word,"" and I say ""dude"" a lot. But nothing like how someone from Philly pronounces water, or someone from Jersey saying radiator as RAD-iator. 

Maybe I have slight vocal fry? Is that the so cal accent? I can do LA more than any other American dialect, and it relies heavily on like, ya know, like vocal fry and like, for instance, a lot of sentences that like... honestly, actually are just like a lot of non-statements and stuff. But that's just sentence structure. 

But it's nothing as pronounced as, say, the Long Island accent which I can hear a mile away. I love southern accents, and love hearing the differences between accents all across Texas.. but I can't do that in cali so well. I guess people in northern California came up with 'hecka' and 'hella,' but that's all I got. 

Whatever my accent is, I assume it's flat with a little vocal fry, but not much else. I'm white, but most of my friends are Hispanic, and I think I've picked up a little TJ twinge that's higher pitched on words like 'sing,' or 'family,' and extra hard on r's like with 'ranch,' and 'harbor.' 

Anyone wanna weigh in on this? I'd love some feedback on how people from So Cal sound like to other people. Thanks!

18,"My therapist told me to name my emotions so that I could look at them objectively and figure out what to do about them, but I'm not sure what I'm feeling tonight.

The emotion is negative.

When I feel like this, it is usually late at night.

The emotion gets me to plan and act, but only for a few seconds at a time. For example, I intended to plan my workouts for the rest of the month, but I wrote the next 2 into the calendar and then just put the calendar away and put my head on my pillow.

It is not nostalgia, disappointment, sadness, frustration, anger, shame, or guilt. It comes close to ""malaise"" and ""fear,"" but is not depressing enough to be the first and not specific enough to be the second.

I just want to finish something, but I'm too full of energy to concentrate and too tired to commit.

I am currently going through a lot of stress with a harsh work schedule that requires me (a person with social anxiety) to be on my feet and interacting with people for several hours straight. While I am an extrovert and love what I do, it is tough on me and I think this is some kind of stress response - the social switch from On to Off is stuck in the middle like a blown fuse and now I'm broken somehow.

I would really like to get to sleep, but this emotion is keeping me up. I would like to find out what it is so that I can figure out what to do about it.

27,"I met this girl at work, Anna. She was a server, I was a chef. We talked little bits here and there, we were generally very friendly but in a co-workers are nice sort of way. We never really talked outside of work, until about 2 months ago. She sent me a text asking if we could hookup, that it would be a one time thing, she was just single for a long time and needed to get off. Me being the single man I am, decided why not? I know they say you aren't supposed to fuck coworkers but, I did. And it was pretty fucking good sex. It was awkward until the first kiss, then it was on fire. So she texts me the next day asking if that could be a more regular thing cause she quite enjoyed herself. Again, I'm single, I'm young, yeah ill have fun. So we continue to hookup every couple days for crazy sex. She's opened my world to all kinds of sexual things. We're getting into light bdsm and sub Dom roles. But she keeps thinking that I'm falling for her. I realised from the beginning that it was nothing more than sex. She is relentless in assuming I'm upset when she talks about girls (she's bisexual) which I'm not. She just seems to project what her feelings would be in my position. But I'm not her, I'm me. And it's frustrating because this is by far the best sex I've gotten, but I hate putting up with her nagging about this whenever we aren't together.

36,"Just a preface, I've needed to get this off my chest for about 5 years now, and even my closest friends of 10+ years have no idea about this. I apologize for the length, you should probably only read it if you went through something similar.


Aside from the occasional arguments, my parents have had an amazing relationship pretty much my entire life, and I was blessed that my childhood was a reflection of that. They had this thing where they would talk to each other in a sickening lovey-dovey voice (like how you would talk to a puppy) and they were shameless in always doing it around me, no matter how much I expressed my disgust. My Dad took my Mom to a nice restaurant every single Sunday, and I'll never forget the time my assistant principal (Ms. Kim, the devil reincarnate, we had quite a history) made my Mom cry over the phone and my Dad took the phone and BLEW the fuck up on her until she had to apologize to both of them. Definitely one of the proudest moments in my life. But they met in high school while volunteering to teach underprivileged kids for free and have been together ever since, so that should give you an idea of their characters and the foundation of their relationship.
On the flip side, I put them through a fair amount of shit throughout middle school and especially high school: getting suspended a few times and eventually expelled 2 weeks before my senior year graduation, getting caught with drugs by the school/cops, and just the typical teenage rebellion phase, but fueled by alcohol, weed, and xanax). Our relationship soured in a lot of ways throughout that period, to the point where they were drug testing me every single month, but things got significantly better after I got to college.


The time away from home kind of put things in perspective- my conversations with my Dad became a lot more personal, transparent and organic, and often times it would feel like I was talking to an older brother rather than my father. I also realized I took my Mom's love for granted and realized how much time I wasted trying to argue with her about stupid shit. Anybody still in high school that regularly argues with Mom (especially an Asian one), you'll eventually learn that there is nothing like a mother's love and that it really isn't worth wasting any time or energy arguing or resisting. Even when she's wrong, she's right, and it's just easier for both of you that way (it's not like you'll listen anyways after you leave the house). But it was all uphill from here, and I considered this a chance to really try and be a model son and repay my parents back for all the bullshit I put them through. Towards the end of my junior year, I noticed some subtle differences when I would come home for breaks. My Dad was always out and they no longer watched Korean dramas in the living room together, she didn't turn the TV off for him when he fell asleep watching a show, I no longer heard the lovey-dovey voices, they didn't go out for dinner on Sundays, and they slept separately (Mom in guest bedroom). The few times I would try to confront either of them about it, I got the same answer. My Dad would say my Mom is mad about some shit about him wanting to take out a loan, it isn't a big deal and not to mention it to her, but my Mom would be a lot more defensive when I tried to even vaguely mention it, so I left it alone for awhile. This persisted for a few months until I got fucking sick of it. I confronted her in the kitchen one day and said it isn't fair for you to be mad at him this long over wanting to take out a loan, and she gave me this look of both pity/disgust, I'll never fucking forget it. She scoffed and said, ""Is that what he told you?"" I could slowly feel my heart crawling on all fours towards the pit of my stomach, and I hesitantly asked her what she was talking about. She told me to call my Dad and ask him, so I stepped outside and I did. When he picked up, I could hear he was at a crowded restaurant with some friends. I explained to him what she said, and I asked him, ""What did you to do Mom?"". He played the dumb part until I started screaming it over and over, louder and louder, until he ended up hanging up. I still haven't been that angry at anything in my entire fucking life. I go back inside and ask my Mom again, and she ended up telling me that he cheated on her.


I didn't know what to say or do in that moment, it felt like I was in a fucking dream, so we just hugged and we cried, and it was my Mom reassuring me instead of the other way around. I asked her if she wanted a divorce, and she quietly said that they were putting it off for now for my sake, and it just absolutely crushed me seeing how defeated and tired she looked in that moment. After everything I put her through, now my Dad had put her through this? Just when things were starting to get better?


Throughout my senior year, I noticed my Dad was no longer out all the time (now my Mom had started going out more), and he was always watching TV in the living room in the same position, lying on the floor with his head at a 90 degree angle against the couch. Watching TV is something most Dads do, but with the way he looked, it was a bit different. For that year, I was pretty much watching him waste away, almost looking lifeless in that same fucking position every single time I saw him, a shell of his former self, but a part of me knew it was so whenever my Mom walked through the door, past the living room and straight into the guest room, she would know exactly where he was and where he was going to be for the rest of the night. So as mad at him as I was, I kind of respected him for that in some odd way. Towards the end of my last year in college, my Dad told me that we would have to move to an apartment, but he found a great one that my Mom and I would love. At this point, my Mom was still sleeping in the guest bedroom, so my Dad told me that he would sleep in the living room while my Mom got the master bedroom. I was naive enough to believe this (I didn't even fucking bother to ask my Mom about it, I guess I was in denial in some strange way), and my Dad secured the lease right before I graduated. About a few weeks after moving in and my Mom was out of town for that period, she calls and asks if I'm going to be living with Dad, and I told her that he said we were all going to be living together. My Mom said she couldn't do that, and I realized that I was a fucking idiot for believing that. To add insult to injury, I didn't want to deal with the moving process again right after finally settling in, even if I would have rather lived with my Mom, so I fucking told her I was going to stay. Still the biggest regret I have of my life and probably the most selfish thing I've ever done.


Within the next few years, my Dad declares bankruptcy, I found out he was visiting prostitutes in his spare time (I saw printout craigslist ads on his work desk, saw texts on his phone), and I was seeing my Mom only a few times a month. I was in a bad place and still am. For the past 4-5 years that I've lived with my Dad, I feel this contempt and hatred in my heart every single fucking time I see him. We've only ate one meal together since we moved into our apartment and never again after that because the tension was so fucking palpable, we never talk because every time he tries I can't even look at him without thinking of my Mom living by herself (she once even asked me to go to some random open house with her just because she misses living in an actual home), I can't go out anywhere with him because I see his eyes wander when women walk by and it makes me fucking sick to my stomach, and he still spends all of his time sitting in his same chair watching TV, just wasting away like he was right before we moved. Every time I come out of my room to use the restroom or grab a glass of water, I can see him staring at me walk by in my peripheral, hoping that I acknowledge him. But I never do.


There have actually been a few times where I actually look back and catch him, and he just looks away, it's fucking sad. And about a year ago, he finally confronted me about it. He told me that he couldn't live with me if I kept treating him like he doesn't exist. He was literally pleading with tears in his eyes, like a child begging for forgiveness, saying that I treat him like he's nothing, a piece of garbage. And he was right. That was the first time in my life I've seen him so helpless and breaking down like that, and it was my fault. I understand that he made a mistake and that he's still my father. He's still the same man that used to carry me to my room when I would pretend to be asleep in the car, he's the one who paid for all of my student loans, bought me 2 cars after 3 accidents, and he's still the man who raised me and made me the man I am today. He still pays for a lot of my Mom's bills, sends her money every month, and I respect him for that. But he's still the fucking person that broke our family apart. That broke my Mom's heart after all she's fucking been through. The reason why there is no such thing as a family or a Christmas dinner in my life. Because he wanted to fuck around after 40+ years of marriage.


What do I do? I've been trying to find a new job to move out, I try to see my Mom at least once a week now, buy her meals/groceries, etc, and I've tried talking to my Dad but I just can't do it.",10Mar2017,6
37,"I don't really feel like I can bring this up with anyone in real life, but I've been thinking about it all day. 

A year and a half ago, I uprooted my whole life and moved halfway across the country to be an Americorps volunteer at a nonprofit. I was seriously depressed and in a job I hated, and in a whirlwind turn of events was offered a position 1000 miles from where I was living. It was the best decision I've ever made, but the first few months were really rough. I had some difficulties with my boss, was under-utilized most of the time at work, and I was generally feeling like I could do nothing right. That my life had no meaning. I was a half second away from quitting and moving back ""home"" because no matter what I did, I felt worthless. 

One year ago, I dragged my depressed ass to a banquet celebrating Americorps members. While I was there, I listened to testimony from other volunteers about how much of a difference they're making in their organizations. Of course, spending most of my time bored and being taken off projects due to a micro managing boss, I absolutely could not relate and it fueled my bitterness. I took this job because I wanted to help people, but I definitely felt like I had helped nobody. 

On my way home that night, I called my mom. Mostly to check in, since that week prior had been highly stressful for me. While on the highway, I suddenly realized I was driving through glass. I turned and looked and saw an overturned car on the side of the road, and a man bleeding next to it. Despite my mom screaming at me to keep driving, I pulled over immediately and jumped out of the car. I saw two children in the car and a woman standing next to it screaming and crying, and the man lying in the road. There were bullet holes in the car and someone mentioned they were shot at. 

An off-duty officer was on the scene - he happened to drive by and pull over as I did - and when I asked what I could do he said to check on the man, since he had been shot in the neck and he was busy getting the kids out of the car and calling for backup. 

Next thing I knew, someone handed me a shirt and I held it around his neck, which was bleeding profusely. I kept telling him to stay with me, that it would be ok, but to this day I can remember the exact second the panic set in. He grabbed my arm and looked up at me and choked ""please don't let me die.""

The whole ordeal lasted maybe 5 minutes before the EMT showed up, and I didn't find out until a few months later if the man lived or not. The first few weeks after it happened, I felt extremely traumatized. But in the aftermath, in the time following, I realized that this changed me. It took some time to realize it, but I became more confident. I haven't felt worthless in months. 

A few months after the incident, the police department contacted me and said I'd receive an award for my actions. They told me that the man survived his injuries, and was told by the doctor that had it not been for the quick actions of people on the scene, that he would not have lived. I never got a chance to meet him, nor do I even know his name, but I think about him a lot. At the award ceremony though, the officer's wife gave me a huge hug and said that the officer was extremely grateful I had been there. 

I can't really bring this up with anyone I know in real life. It feels extremely selfish to. But I've been reliving the memory all day today, of what happened and everything I felt in the following weeks. I can't emphasize enough how much this affected me, and my friends don't really understand. I just needed to share it with someone.

38,"Oh yeah, so fucking hardcore. Look at me smashing a damn granola bar in my face while I do something masculine. Mmmmm. Listen to the voice actor trying to sound like a hardened prisoner yacking away about eating these bars as if they are 3 pounds of hot wings. The music is soooo inspiring because, as a woman, you should feel like you are intense for actually eating... a shitty, overpriced diet snack. 

Fuck. Off.

You insult me. ",10Mar2017,1

Verse 1: 

I'm a hot boy/ you a not boy/ I fuck boy/ you a fuck, boy/ I smoke ya/ ya girl, I poke her/she called me a king, no poker/ I'm on fire but I slow roast ya/ gun cocked, no holster/ bang bang call the nuns/ you get none/ im the hottest, son/ under the sun/ i don't do this shit for fun/ you better run/ cause when you know how I

Verse 2: 
I pull up on ya/ put the gun up on ya/ you a bitch, I see piss up on ya/ you wet, you get wetted/ you owe me bitch, you more debted/ dont put the shit on credit/ i want the green, get it/ I'm the best, admit it/ no matter how you try to spin it, call ya emmitt, smith like will/ I will kill/ take ya girl out, give her the bill, cause I

40,"I'm serious. I'm out of ideas. I have tried to solve this riddle for six years. I have had plenty of theories, but at this point the theories have become a really good psychological movie plot, in other words I'm just making shit up, trying to do explain my weirdness. 

No matter what i am doing, no matter what situation, or the state of mind i am in, I JUST WANT TO BE ALONE.

I hate this, and i so want to change it, but it is so addicting.


Edit: i should add that i have sought help, with no avail. I have been hospitalized in psychiatric nursing home, went through plenty of treatments. 

I am happy, I'm existentialist, i try to be better everyday, no self-esteem issues, almost no anxiety (probably less than normal amount). ",10Mar2017,1

42,"After nearly a year and a half of being unemployed, I landed a job at some place.  The pay was decent, the work was hard, but interesting.  I sort of got the impression that management were a bunch of jerks, but whatever.  After a week at work of doing my best and no complaints to speak of, I caught full blown flu.  A day later, while still laying in bed more or less incapacitated, they called to let me know that I have been terminated.  I am completely devastated.",10Mar2017,7
43,"I tend to get into arguments with folks on FB, in person, on reddit, on the plethora of other forums I'm on.  I'm a member of a skeptic society and tend to discuss, debate and research **a lot**.  I thought I'd share a brief list of what I think and feel.... maybe it'll engender rational discourse... who knows...  
  
Let's start with my base philosophy....    
Adults own themselves.  They are free to think, feel, speak and do with their bodies as they see fit. They can live their lives as they see fit provided they are not causing intentional or physical harm to another.    
  
Let’s let that sit for a moment.    
  
This means people can think, believe and choose for them and their family what they think is good and right and live that way as long as they aren’t actively hurting anyone else.  
  
They can read what they want.  
They can believe in any god they want; or no god.  
They can feel towards anyone as they want.  
They can say what they want.  
They can own what they want as long as it’s not another human.  
They can believe in pseudoscience, deny science and embrace any/all ideologies provided they are not actively harming another person.  
This also means they are responsible for their own lives.    
  
Now to break it down…  
- There is no such thing as white privilege.  
- There is class privilege.  That is because the world is not a level playing field and those born of means have greater access to success.  
- There is no institutional racism.  That means there are not rules and laws and regulations nor processes making sure that any ethnic group is harmed by any institutions.  
- There is personal racism, yes.  But people have the right to believe and feel what they want as long as they aren’t actively harming another.  
- There is no such thing as a thought crime.  
- There is no such thing as Islamophobia.  All religions are open to ridicule.  None of them are sacrosanct.  
- Gender dysphoria is a disorder.  However, adults can choose to live their lives as they see fit.  Normalizing it isn’t a thing as it’s not normalized.  Putting children through gender reassignment, even hormone blockers, is child abuse.  
- People have the right to marry any other consenting adult and no one has the right to deny them that.    
- Drugs should not be illegal.  Decriminalize, regulate and tax the fuck out of them.  
- Prostitution should not be illegal.  Human trafficking should be stomped out with aggressive focus but if any adult chooses to rent out their body for sexual reasons it is their right.    
- the US and specifically college campuses is not a *rape culture*.  These do exist in the world and they tend to exist in areas people refuse to acknowledge due to the predominate religion of those areas.    
- If go dressed like a terrorist to a protest your position is wrong; if you riot your position is wrong; if you respond with violence to someone who feels differently than you then you are a terrorist – you are the fascist, and your position is wrong    
- Health care is a human right, access to health care is something that the government is responsible for providing; people’s lives and well-being do not fit into a model of economics; you do not go find the lowest bidder to do your knee surgery and the concept that people will do this is wrong and evil.      
- Illegal immigration is a problem and the current move to capture and deport is aimed at criminals, not immigrants.  The current narrative is misleading on purpose.    
- The reason why the minimum wage hasn’t kept pace with inflation is that there is always someone willing to do the work cheaper than you.  Using government to inflate the minimum wage then nothing is done to stop the influx of people willing to work for pennies to the dollar will do nothing to change the end result; prices will rise, wages will stay stagnant, and those brought into this country to work for cheaper than you will drive wages down.  This is not just illegal aliens doing hard farm labor, this is also the army of H1B visa highly skilled people we have filling the tech industry in this country.    
- gun control doesn’t stop crime.  Drug control doesn’t stop crime.  In fact both encourage it and create new crime.    
- Education is something that should be a right, but it should not be controlled by the government, and left up to the parents as to what they want their child taught.  Yes, this does mean that there are parents that will teach their children that the earth is only 6,000 years old and a man saved every animal on the planet in a wooden boat.  But, guess what.  They’re doing it already.  What is happening is everyone else is being left behind by a managed test focused education system that fails children at a high level.    
- space exploration is something that needs greater investment.  If you intend on living in your mother’s house for the rest of your life then you will have a very stunted life.  It’s time we focus on spreading our wings and taking to other places.  And, no, we do not have to fix all the problems here first – that is an asinine comment.  It’s like saying I won’t go to the gym until I lose this weight.    
- Having a life partner is a good thing.  A stable home life helps people emotionally and mentally and regardless if it’s a binary parent, or same sex parent, kids from a loving home with loving parents home grow up healthy and loved.  
- Dads need to be men and be there for their kids.  Real men take care of their families.    
- We need the police.  And they should wear body cams.    
- If you respond to rhetoric with violence you are wrong and you are a fascist  
- Islam is not compatible with Western Culture.  If you believe that it is then study the Koran.  I spent a year studying the Koran and the Hadith.  Do the same, make your own conclusion.  
- Women own their own reproductive rights, they own their own bodies, and they are the final arbiter of having an abortion or not.  As such abortion should be legal and easily available, as should all health support for everyone.  
- If you use words like cis-white-male and patriarchy and are serious about them your position is wrong.  
- Where you are in your life is based on the decisions you made to end up there in your life.  There is no conspiracy that puts you there.  Good decisions result in good results and bad decisions result in bad results.  If you have worked a good job your entire life but just can’t seem to get ahead then you are bad with money.  The system is not out to get you.  You need to own your life, own your actions, and own your accountability.  
- Vaccines do not cause autism.    People that insist that they do are best, deluded, and at worst monsters that want to hurt children.  
- Climate change is real.  There are not climate change skeptics, there are climate change deniers.  True scientific skepticism focuses on delivering studies for peer review.      
- Evidence based reasoning, the ability to be wrong when evidence contradicts what you think is right, rational discourse, these are all important in a civilized society and it’s how we as people grow and learn

48,"I really wanted to share this and didn't know where to put it so I'm sorry if it's not in the right place!

My day was brightened today, because I brightened someone else's. I didn't think what I was doing was special, but to the person I was communicating with, it meant everything to them. It made me feel so good about it that I started to realize that making an impact on someone doesn't always mean doing something major. It's the little things.

I am a Caucasian female who lives and has a business in a predominantly Chinese city. I often have people who are either new to, or visiting this city, therefore speak very little or no English. I struggle daily with not knowing how to speak Chinese and it means that communication rarely happens with a lot of the people I come into contact with.

Today, I saw a Chinese man standing near my store, so I approached him and said hello. He responded in Chinese, but seemed like he wanted to talk to me. I pulled out my phone and opened the Google Translate app and showed him to speak into it. When translated, it said ""I was just wanting to say hello"". I responded by saying hello to him (In Chinese). His face lit up and a smile came across his face cheek-to-cheek. He took my phone again, said something else, and then waved good-bye. The translation was, ""Thank you for your kindness"".

And it hit me. He's a foreigner trying to blend in with those around him who are not like him. He could live here comfortably for his whole life and never learn to speak English, because *I* am the minority. But he wanted to say hello to me. It filled my heart with warmth. You could see that I filled his heart with warmth too, just for taking that little extra step to acknowledge him.
