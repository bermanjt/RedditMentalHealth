Lie and people like me.

Then something bad happens in their lives and they all decide to take it out on me.

As a result I then need to answer for my lies.  To liars...

I spend years digging out of the pit they chucked me into.  Because I ""owe"" them.

Then I am brought into a new fold.

Tell the truth and they don't like me.

They encourage me to lie or I am stripped of everything again.

So I lie...

Then they like me again.

7,"It has become more difficult to agree 100% with myself. I feel, as if, I'm always struggling to understand myself. I'm not sure how to process or even understand emotions. 

My heart says:
Do the right thing and be understanding; things will be alright if you show kindness and love. 

My mind says: 
What the fuck are you doing?; be subjective and analyze the situation. Don't let emotions lead you, take action, move forward. 

I think both sides bring up a good point; now, how do we reach a compromise that won't drive me insane? I would like to feel, understand, and overcome. I would like to experience, learn, and evolve. No more fighting between the two, let's start working as a unit and gain strength to face, head on, the rollercoaster that is life. 

How do I get started? What must I do to accomplish this balance, and create a stronger communication between both?

10,"Free will does not exist, It's limited to the subconscious mind learned patterns hence it's far away from true free will, Our minds only choose to say A and B because we learned A and B previously, That is far away from infinite free will. There is no good or bad which makes the ego threatened due to it picking choices heavily with it's past conditioned self, as it learns this it feels threatened and it fears the future. 

 That's what happens when the egoic mind gets a hold of insights that it perceives as threatening to its ""survival"". This is an important lesson in itself. It's a fear-based reaction, that's simply what it does, until it gradually dawns on you that there's no need to fear what's true.

If it's true that you have no free will and that there is no meaning and purpose and good and evil and all that, then it has always been true. Even when you thought otherwise. And yet everything continues as normal, it always has and it always will. Your mind is simply reacting to the IDEA of it now, and that idea is really just another one of its own phantoms. Just like the ego itself.

Basically if you're talking to yourself about some insight or other, then it's not the actual insight, it's just talking to yourself about it. And that's what the ego does to try and claim it for itself, and use it as an excuse to rationalize and justify its own agenda.

The remedy for all this is to become aware of how this works, to understand it, to see it happen in your own experience and see through the mechanism, so that you don't need to believe it anymore. This is the foundation of all progress: Observation.  awareness alone is curative. When you start seeing it for what it really is, the habit starts unlearning itself because it is no longer receiving fuel to sustain itself. (Note that not all awareness is curative because a low level awareness cannot see the wrong, cannot see various patterns due to lacking a lot of insights and intellect, therefore leveling up awareness with certain epistemology is very essential) 

The mind/body mechanism that you call yourself is quite capable of learning and adapting, no free will required, but the system needs proper feedback in order to do so. Your impartial discerning awareness is what provides that.

And given that it's fear which fuels ego, it's always good to confront your own fears (one at a time, in manageable portions). Ego sustains itself by avoiding them, but when you stop bowing to it and instead go into your fears, that's how the system learns that there is actually nothing to be afraid of. So in that light, it can be extremely fruitful to contemplate suicide, lack of control, meaninglessness, etc. rather than continue avoiding it and turning it into a problem.

Wrong doesn't exist, remember? So when your ego tells itself that there's something wrong about having no control or meaning or whatever, even though it's a fact, then that reaction warrants some serious scrutiny. These are the tricks it uses and your job is to learn to stop falling for it. It doesn't happen overnight.

You are the creator of you. You have been influenced by the ego of others. Take a look around you. Look at the people you love and who love you. Contemplate the many things that make you happy. Could be a sunset, silence, a favorite food, movie, song. Perhaps you would like to learn an instrument and expand your creating into music.  Perhaps fitness added to your experience would be enjoyable. Consider these things as you look around you right now, and have a great laugh when I tell you, there is nothing. See how I am feeding my ego in telling you there is nothing and no free will. Imagine, as you see, hear, touch and smell the glorious world that God has created for us to experience, Imagine that I tell you that there is nothing, that you aren't making choices. Now imagine that I am telling you this so I can make money. There. Clarity. 

 You are constructing a picture without having ever seen the world for what it is. You trust others to tell you what the world looks like, without bothering to open your eyes. All you see is darkness, and you hear people telling you about the light. How will that not make someone depressed? How could you possibly understand the light, if you have never seen it? If all you see is darkness, even light you will imagine as dark. 

 This is fundamental.  This is fundamental. I repeat this is fundamental.

11,"So I was looking on dating apps and such for a guy to have sex with anyway, because I've been pretty horny lately. I'm gay if that matters. Then this one guy messages me and asks if we can have sex, and sends me a picture of himself. I didn't answer for a while so he then sent me a picture of a 100 dollar bill and asks me if that would persuade me. I told him I would think about it.

I'm 18, and I am living on my own now because I moved out of my parents. He is 58 and a fucking farmer. I need the money though. So I went through it.

I won't go into the grizzly details, but I did make him wear a condom. Easiest 400 dollars I've ever made. Should I be ashamed of myself? Because I am not at all. Kind of proud actually.

13,"How can you say you ''love'' me when you don't even know me. In a superficial human sense they are correct but at a deeper level I know them better than they know themselves. Yes, I realize that sounds arrogant  and I promise I will stop being arrogant tomorrow.

I am not speaking of human love when I say ''love ya''. It has nothing to do with a human being loving another person... there is no such thing as a ''person'', that's just a concept built upon a collection of thoughts, memories and stories. Those stories of human love, for another, for country, for flag, etc. are all just that, stories. Entertaining, but just stories. If they were all added up in a pos and neg manner, I would suggest that they have caused more human grief than happiness.

Living in your stories is a sure road to suffering for the simple reason that they are not true. They are projections of your past hurts and pains into a future collection of should be's, wanna be's, might be's, I need and I don't want's. 

Back to human love for a moment. Can you love a person? You might come very close. How? Simply let them be... without projecting anything on them. Don't try to help them or hinder them. Let them experience what they are experiencing. Stop thinking you know a better way, that you can improve them. (how does one improve a dream character?). Stop playing God... if for no other reason that it is disrespectful of that ''other's'' need to experience what they are experiencing.

How many of you have gotten into a romantic relationship with the thought...something like.. ''Gee.. he/she would be just great, 100% perfect if I just tweak that little habit, and perhaps help them realize this/that/whatever. Yeh, I think I can work with them. Gosh life will be great when they realize blah, blah, blah, blah... I sure hope the don't turn out like my last love.''

So... let's focus on ''you''. When you fall in love what do you want? Would you like to have someone completely and totally, without any reservations, accept you AS YOU ARE? How would that feel? Would that not ring of true human love? Should change be appropriate from time to time, wouldn't that be an excellent starting point, unconditional acceptance? On the other hand, how does it feel to be conditionally loved.. like... I love you if/but/when... garbage? Yes, it is garbage because it's just a rerun of stale stories. AND they are not even your stories... they are someone else's of how you should be ... often repeated over a lifetime and inevitably ending up with the same old, same old...   borrring...

One last point... if you are going to try this I suggest it has nothing to do with words. You don't tell a person anything... actions go deeper and beingness goes much deeper. Pick someone in your life.. it might be a homeless beggar you just noticed in the street, or a spouse... or anything in between.

Decide for a period of time.. starting small, just one minute will do, that you will unconditionally love, accept, forgive and totally allow that person to be what they happen to be... not what you think they are (you don't have a clue anyways) just whatever they are. Let it go as deep as you can and as best you can. They are what they are and they are doing the best they can with what they have. Who are you to get in their way? It's none of your business and IMHO it's totally arrogant and presumptive of you to do so.

BUT WAIT, what the hell are you doing? Aren't you trying to change people? Give me a break!


Well put... and there is a very real difference between what I preached above (forgive me, I know not what I do) and what I practice (I have a pretty good idea of that).

Let me make up a brief story and see if I can dig myself a hole.  

A friend comes to you and says, ''I really need help with X''. If, and I emphasize ''IF"" they appear very sincere and ''IF'' they come out and ask you for help (i.e., it's not something you are reading into their expressions) then my experience is that you have an obligation to offer assistance: Don't offer something you don't have.

 Moving past enlightenment  you don't really know anything, and that's the whole point, Nobody really knows anything, but everybody is constantly pretending (and believing) that they do.

A path for waking up is the path when one is looking around for truth wherever he/she thought it might be hiding, and not finding it anywhere. That's how you discover for yourself that you don't actually know what you thought you knew. Can you focus on such a task for so long before grasping it's significance? 

That's everyone's path, IF they are on a path to enlightenment. In the broad strokes, that is the essence of any path. You find yourself in a swamp of illusions, and waking  up means nothing more or less than destroying them all.

That's the only possible path. But almost nobody is walking it. No one wants to find their true self, they are mere dreamers that keep identifying with their subconscious thinking it's them when it's not. The subconscious just copies what's around it nothing more or less, you call this free will? I call it limited will of lies.

A day where earth will have it's wake up call would be absolutely interesting. An age where a new spiral dynamics of a hyper mind that is already aware of it being will be bliss. Utopia you say? Hahaha.. I can only laugh at us being the joke of importance ",13May2017,5

22,"Now, I'm not a superstitious kind of person, usually. I believe that everything is what you make of it. But I have noticed some weird stuff happening to me lately.

It all starts about 3 years ago. I was in a band, we'd just spent a lot of money recording a debut EP, we had a buzz going and so on. One night me and my band mates went for a walk to decompress after a long day in the studio. It was 2am, up in the countryside where I live. I turned around to the guys and jokingly said ''It'd be really handy to see a shooting star right now''. Low and behold, we all look up, and straight after those words left my mouth - a shooting star darts across the sky. We all turn to each other, our minds are blown and I say ''well... better make a wish boys'' - none of us told each other what our wishes were.

Long story short, a few months later we get signed to a record label in New York. After signing, I turned to the guys and, unrelated to previous conversation, I ask, ''So, what did you wish for?'' and every one of them looked at me and said ''This.'' at the same time.

Unfortunately, 3 months after signing I fell very sick - it caused friction in the band, the other band members left, the label took a back seat and I was left at square one.

Fast forward to a year later, I'm back on my feet, more inspired than ever, now working with a friend I've known since High School. I want to release the album I've always wanted to release - the one I was meant to release. We're in the throes of recording this album right now. One night about a month ago we went for a walk through the same countryside at about 3am. We were chatting about what we want to achieve with this album, how excited we are and so on. This sparked my memory of what happened 3 years ago when me and my old band mates saw the shooting star. The friend I'm working with knows about this story, so I turned to him and said ''Haha, I wonder if I'll see another shooting star toni-'' I turn around mid-sentence and yet another shooting star interrupts me. I was stunned, me and my friend look at each other like ''Seriously... that's just fucking weird''. So once again, I made a wish and so did he. We'll see what happens.

Also this week I was sat in my garden, thinking about all of the things I've got to do to get my band back up out of the dirt, getting a little stressed. When out of nowhere a white pigeon flies out of the bushes and just sits on the wall next to me - I've never seen a more placid pigeon before. None have ever really come close to me without freaking out and flying off. I felt this urge to hold out my hand - So I did. The pigeon hopped on my hand and sat there for a minute before flying off somewhere else.

Like I said - I prefer to make of things what I want - and I'm going to take this as a sign. But despite that, it's still just really convenient.",13May2017,20
24,"I had a great start in life 
I couldn't of had higher self esteem and a better family 
But it's all been downhill since I became a teenager

Everyone else seemed to be so straight and narrow and know what they want to do with their life 
Where as the only thing I knew how to do was be myself 
But I can't even do that anymore 

It started off with a toxic relationship as a teenager that turned my light upside down 

Then realising I can't relate to most people anywhere I go 

Realising I'm never going to make it on guitar big in life and I went to college and uni four years of study to not even get an interview in my chosen field 

Also within this last ten years all my uncles and the only grand parent I knew died 

I've been betrayed by people closest to me and when I was happy everyone was constantly trying to tear me down 

I'm a guy so naturally if your genuinely happy as a guy other guys want to dominate you and put you back in your place 

I'm sick of people and I'm sick of myself 

I couldn't wait to get work as soon as I was sixteen 
My first job was McDonald's and I was so enthusiastic and positive yet that buzz soon went away 
I hated getting bossed around by miserable middle aged woman 
I hated that your personality means absolutely jack shit to your co workers or bosses 
And your basically a battery chicken doing the same thing day in day out 

My ex as a teenager begged me to stay in a relationship saying how I'm the only good thing in her life blah blah then as soon as she got the chance she was round other blokes houses  after all the dogshit I went through with her she used me just to get a one up in life 
This hurt because I had much hotter girls after me and I could of had my pick of any girl before I went out with her and even during the relationship but it was never about that for me 

My parents are old as fuck and have all been in hospital 

I don't feel like I can trust fucking anybody anymore 

I've had six jobs all sucking the life out of me and after applying for three hundred and getting six weeks temp work and loosing my car due to not having the funds to keep it on the road I gave up 

I started off with the strongest personality and character 
I was driven and I loved life 

But here I am at twenty five feeling like I'm done with it 

It feels like everything has been a step down from where I came from and no matter what way you cut it its all been down hill since I went out with my ex and it's my fault for letting it 

I feel empty and a shell of myself 
I don't want to make friends as everyone ends up a let down and I don't want a girlfriend because I can't sustain a meaningful relationship being so jaded as I am 

Some of my old friends are becoming alcoholics and their parents dying also 

Others have got their shit together and I never see them 

I don't know what I'm living for 
It feels like life has broken me and I don't know what to do 

I felt more like a man at fifteen 

I wish I could go back in time lower my expectations and move out my parents house asap but I can't 

I've comepletely lost myself living here and don't know what to do 

I've been in this rock bottom rut since college

Like I needed to be more depressed. 

What's more, I don't even believe some of them; at the very least, they aren't universally true. I'm apparently just such a singularly shitty person I don't deserve to be happy, successful, or safe, no one can ever genuinely love me, everyone hates me behind my back, my entire existence is just a worthless, disgusting blot on history. Other people don't have these problems, but I do. Other people matter, are loved thoughout their lives, make a difference, achieve dreams and joy, don't hurt people, but I do. Because the cats said so. The title says 'truth', so it must be, right?

Why not just walk in front of a car on my way home today? No one will care (something I've thought about many times). My life has no value and I'm not worthy of unconditional love or good enough for conditional love, the internet says so. So why not.

I'm a bad person, I know that. I tell myself that every day. I was just reading the comments and it seems most people agree that these are all true, so much so they find them funny. It's funny knowing that you will never be loved or successful, that everyone is evil and sociopathic and out to get you. Idealism is for stupid people, obviously (though hell, I refuse to give mine up). If there's nothing out there for a sick narcissist like me, why bother? I despise myself for being so weak as to be hurt by some memes, so much disgust I can't fully express it. 

EDIT: I can't seem to stop adding to this. I just reread the post. Some I still disagree with from experience, some I already know and have no problem with, some are almost a challenge. But I'm still shaking inside. I guess self-loathing is better than emptiness for a little bit.",13May2017,4

Everyone I know (save like, 2 people) tells me I have weird dating standards.

I'm an Indian girl (living in Canada), and at the risk of sounding conceited, have been told that I am physically attractive. For context, /r/RateMe seems to think I'm a 7 on average.

I tend to date guys who are objectively a little less attractive, but very intelligent/passionate about one field. Usually in the sciences. 

I also enjoy dressing up/looking good, but do not expect them to do the same. In addition, I do the whole quintessential domestic woman thing, and cook, clean, etc when required.

The only thing that I do expect from my SO's is conversation, and acknowledging our relationship in public without being embarrassed about it (holding hands, sitting next to each other, etc) which is often easily obtained. 

The problem is (I'm so sorry for how proud I'm going to sound) that a lot of the men I date either oversell themselves, or try too hard to be the ""Alpha"" to match up to me in a sense (their words, not mine) and I have to break it off because it gets annoying.
