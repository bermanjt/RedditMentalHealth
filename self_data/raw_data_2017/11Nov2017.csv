4,"I work in a small, specialized clinic in a hospital. Most of our patients will be with the rest of their life, coming in on a regular, scheduled basis. As such, you get to form friendships with patients and get to know them on a more personal level. 

Patient A is a late-middle-aged woman of most likely liberal leanings. I could easily see her being a 'flower child' back in the 70's. She friendly and socially adept person, but also very much of a flirt.

To start their appointment, we take them to a private exam room. I will do a point of care test, leave, input the results into our computer system and then a medical professional will come in and discuss those results. 

Patient A was in a good mood walking in the door. I greeted her by name, asked her to sit in the waiting room while I checked her in. I checked her in, left my office towards the exam rooms, set up the computer, supplies, logbook. I then walked back towards the waiting room and said ""Patient A, I'm ready for you""

She was the only patient in the waiting room and responded ""I haven't had a cute, young man say that to me a long time"". I laughed and said thank you and told her to follow me towards the rooms.

I let her go into the room first and I followed behind, closed the door and proceeded to start with the appointment. Like I do most all my patients, I asked how they were. We had small talk and she asked me if I had any plans for the weekend. I said ""Not really, chores and stuff"". She said I should ""Go out and sow my wild oats"" I laughed and said ""Oh, you know, I go out and about"". She then proceeded to say ""When I was younger, I used to eat so much pussy I had to go to the dentist twice a week for a haircut"". 

I blush insanely easy and I'm sure I had to be blood red. Lucky for me, I have a thick beard that covers up most of my face. I had to laugh out of sheer awkwardness because I didn't know what I could have said to that. She is laughing too and all I can say is ""That's just terrible"". Inside, I was cringing and thinking about how I don't want to hear about her sexual conquests. She could have said dicks and I would have cringed just as hard. It wasn't about her sexuality as much as I've now been blatantly hit on by someone who is supposed to be under my care and she now wants to share her sexual history.

I was able to quickly finish up my portion of the appointment and excuse myself. I didn't tell my superior what the patient had said until she was gone. My superior was shocked too but didn't really have much to say otherwise. 

I don't know how to feel. Between the blatant come ons and describing her sexual conquests, I am really not sure what is happening. Even if I was remotely attracted to her, there's no way it'd be a good idea to do anything with a patient. ",11Nov2017,2

6,"(Note: I am a left leaning person of color, so don't claim I'm alt-right or sexist or something.

In my opinion, people are hugely overreacting to the Louis CK scandal.

I don't think what CK did is acceptable, but can you really call it sexual harassment? There was consent and CK did not assault, force himself upon, or even lay a hand on any of these women.

People are saying ""they thought he was joking! It's not really consent."" But it doesn't matter if they thought he was joking, they verbally expressed that they would permit CK to masturbate in front of them. They might have been uncomfortable but that's not sexual harassment.

Is it a little fucked up that he capitalized on these women's admiration of him? Yes. But again, nobody was hurt. And looking at a man masturbating might be gross, but it's hardly disturbing.

Compare this scandal to Kevin Spacey, who groped underage men, or Weinstein, who has been accused of RAPE. Why are we focusing on this, which I wouldn't even classify as sexual assault? It's not like anyone was harmed or advanced upon. This has all been blown out of proportion.

Tl;dr: CK did not physically or sexually abuse anyone. While his actions were inappropriate, they were clearly permitted by the women. ",11Nov2017,0
7,"Many people are using this subreddit to post anything. And I suppose that yes, you can post pretty much anything here. But sometimes it feels like people are using this sub for things that would fit better in other subs like r/assistance or /r/legaladvice or even, sometimes, /r/SuicideWatch or /r/depression. Also, there seems to just be a lack of positive/happy stuff on this subreddit. It pains me a bit. It's not that you SHOULDN'T post sad stuff, it's just that this isn't always the best sub for it. There are more specific subs. For me, this is just a sort of general sub for things that don't quite fit everywhere, or things that fit into way too many subreddits. What does anyone else think of this? Agree? Disagree? let me know.

8,"It was like I was Marty McFly in back to the future or some shit and I fucked something up in the past and the need to go back. I got a feeling like I knew something bad was going to happen, but it wasn't because I knew about that thing with time travel changing the future (where you originally were in time), it was because it was an animation and I was watching myself. As I was watching myself, I could hear the creator of the animation asking if I would help him make it. I felt unsure, but as I was waking up, I thought I should say yes because I thought it would be a good way to get a bit of money. When I realized that that was a dream, I think the first thing I thought was ""oh, it was a dream. Oh... Well, fucking dammit.""

Then I woke up and saw someone in the shadow of the gate at the bottom of the stairs after I was drinking some water.

14,"Here's the scenario: 

I work at a multicultural private kindergarten/preschool in Japan. 
The school has a very hard-working staff, the kids are very loving and excited to learn, the school is fairly new to the idea of being multicultural, and the school is going to change in order to be more centered on having teachers from other cultures involved in the children's school activities (where before the teacher's main goal was to teach the children English, and to help with special events i.e. Halloween, track n' field day, etc). I'm very proud of where I get to work.

We also have a special class where we get to teach 10 students whose parents pay extra in order to spend the latter part of their day learning about a different part of the world. Because of the class size &amp; the fact that there are two teachers running the class, we get to do a lot of science experiments, art projects, cooking lessons, have special guest teachers, career days, etc. 

One day one of the teachers in the school asked me ""Can you please ask the accountant to order neon paint for your special class?"" This is because she thought that if she asked for her class that it wouldn't get approved. 

This really hit me hard, and I felt ashamed of my school at that moment. Prior to that I thought the accountant was fair with approving funding for materials &amp; supplies. Our kids' parents probably pay one of the highest monthly fees in the area, but the teachers are not being able to provide their students with what they think would make their lesson that much more exciting or educational. 

I know that introducing classroom budgets will put extra responsibility on the teachers, but from what I've researched up to this point, classroom budgets do make a huge difference in teachers feeling appreciated &amp; in students receiving a more exciting, enriching education. 

I also know that initially this could cause extra work for the person in charge of creating the budgets, which would most likely be the school accountant. So that is where I might receive opposition in the presentation of such an idea.

What I really would like to find is concrete examples of schools that have introduced classroom budgets, and how introducing such an idea has affected the school. I'm open to both positive and negative affects, I just think that the positive will outweigh the negative considering so many teachers are positive towards classroom budgets in my home country.

Thank you to anyone who reads this post, and helps me in my planning to hopefully make a difference at my school.",11Nov2017,0

24,"Basically, I am an 18 year old who decided to take a bit of a different route to my future. I decided to save up money, and move out with a friend here in NYC with my cat. I am born/raised in this city, and absolutely love it despite the negatives that come alongside it. My family had to move to NJ for work related purposes, and unlike a normal 16 year old who would transfer schools, i decided to travel nearly everyday back and fourth from mid NJ all the way to my High School in NY. I really grew and became the person i am currently due to the move, i traveled, worked, met a lot of amazing people, and really learned a lot about myself, i even met my now ex-boyfriend (who i recently broke up with) in the process. I don't even know how to word this to be honest, but in short... ever since i moved out, plans have been changing left and right; the dynamic between almost everyone in my life feels totally different. I was supposed to be living with my best friend in a studio apartment, but that didn't quite work out. We ended up finding a place that worked perfectly for us, pet friendly, literally upstairs from my old workplace. The realtors ended up not accepting us, even with my guarantor. I forgot to mention that my family is moving out of the house in NJ and back into the city (this time with a much smaller apartment because of me being so insistent on moving out. In short, if i didn't find a place within a month i would be fucked (aka living without my own room or a place for my things and staying in a place that fuels my anxiety and stress. Luckily for myself, i found (completely by chance) while on a fb thread, that a friend of mine was looking for immediate roommates. I took the risk, and without looking much more into it (i had been to her place before and actually loved it) and i moved in. Things ended up going downhill since my best friend was being extremely strange, barely showing up to the apartment, paying her side of the rent late, and ultimately creating a ton of conflict. That aside, i found another room mate, and the conflict between my best friend and i has mostly faded. The real issue here is simply that... i've experienced so much in this relatively small time frame, and am overwhelmed. I was in yet another intimate relationship, lost my best friend for a moment, changed jobs, got blackout drunk at my own party, decorated and organized, created and destroyed, had a terrible experience with smoking weed (even more racing existential thoughts than usual. I guess what i'm realizing, is the true reality of our world, it is so small, yet massive at the same time. I'm not currently in school, but am aiming to go back next upcoming fall, and ideally traveling overseas to Japan to pursue teaching english and working on street fashion related projects. I'm sorry for this rambling, i just needed to shove all of these thoughts somewhere, and decided to make a Reddit account after reading a ton of threads that really gave me glimpses of other people's lives. So guys, what should i do? Is there anything to do? How do i keep myself happy and motivated? Is it normal to feel such a wide range of emotions in one day, week, month, etc?

26,"This happened years ago, but my birthday is approaching and this incident still haunts me. 

It was my birthday and I was walking home from the transit center after work. I always used this time to call my mother who lives across the country in my home town. So, I call my mother as usual and she wishes me a happy birthday and tells me that my birthday present had been delivered that day. I get to the front door and, sure enough, there are two identical boxes stacked on top of each other. The one on top had my name on it written in my mother's familiar handwriting.

I take both boxes inside to the dining room table, put the box on top aside, and excitedly start ripping into the other identical box. It's all wrapped in tissue paper and it's heavy. It's a vase with a lid. I'm a little confused at this point. It's a nice enough vase, but not really my taste, and my mom knows me well enough for me to think this is a strange gift. I think to myself that the REAL present must be INSIDE the vase. 

Now is the time for some back story. I had two roommates, and all three of us were from the same small hometown across the country. One of my roommate's mother had died rather suddenly a couple of months prior. He went home for the funeral and had been back for a while, so this wasn't immediately on my mind.

Back to me, wondering what birthday treasure I would find in this strange vase. I open it slowly because it's making sort of a scratching sound, like sand on glass. I finally get it open and look inside, and only then did I finally realize the huge fuck up I had just made. I had just opened my roommates dead mother instead of my birthday present. 

A few little pieces of bone fell out onto the floor and my hands begin shaking uncontrollably as I set what I now recognize as an urn containing my roommate's dead mother back onto the table. There was ""dust"" on my hands and I began hyperventilating, tears gushing down my face. Some of the dust gets into my mouth as I wipe the tears from my face. I am too confused to vomit.

At this point, my other roommate came into the room. I looked as if I had seen a ghost (which I guest I kind of just did). I told him what had just happened, still shaking uncontrollably. I don't remember much of a reaction aside from laughter and probably the obligatory ""That is so fucked up."" 

I was truly mortified. I looked at the name on the box I had just opened. It was addressed to my roommate. Was what I had just done illegal? Was I now going to be haunted for life? Am I going straight to Hell? I dont know how this stuff works. 

It took me a while to get my shit together enough to pick up the tiny pieces of bone I had spilled, place the urn back into the box, and put it in my roommates room with a note on top that said ""I am so fucking sorry.""

TL;DR - I opened up a box that was not addressed to me on my birthday thinking it was my birthday present, but it turned out to be the creamated remains of my roommate's dead mother. I'm probably haunted for life and going to Hell. Happy birthday to me.",11Nov2017,134
28,"we were in a long distance relationship. england me, america her. i was going to go over for christmas. i noticed her getting distant, moreso this last week.   
she went on a road trip today, and i came back from uni and was just telling her she seemed distant because everyone says communication is best. she told me we need to have a serious call over this and then stopped talking. we loved each other. i loved her so much. i was panicking the fuck out because i didnt understand why she was acting as if we needed to break up out of the blue. for the next 4 hours she ghosted me as i messaged her pleading with her to talk to me, but she didnt look at any of it and occasionally put stuff on her snapchat story. i checked her snapchat location constantly and saw that she wasnt in a no connection zone or anything because it said ""2m ago"". 

4 hours later we video call. im already astounded at how someone who supposedly loves me can straight up ignore me for 4 hours. she's smiling. she stops smiling after i ask her why she's smiling when i clearly look distraught. she tells me she wants us to break up for now. i'm pleading with her and almost begging, trying to get her to give it another chance. she said she needed something real and she didnt have that and its neither of our faults. 

she told me she hadnt had a real life relationship in 3 years, and now she finally has the chance to. i was confused and asked who. she wouldnt tell me. she pulled down her shirt and showed me hickeys and marks. my stomach dropped.   

i wanted to know the details. i was very angry and told her how shitty of a person she is. she told me it was someone she had always found attractive and he added her on snapchat. they flirted, sent pictures, and then he went over and they did oral stuff in the past week. then apparently they fucked twice and he slept in her bed too. all the while i'm here, 4000 miles away, 5 hours thinking im being dumb for worrying about her being distant. She went behind my back and let another man fuck her and do all sorts of things to her while telling me she loved me. even the idea of her flirting with another guy and sending him nudes and dirty talking makes me sick. I hate her. I can't believe she would do this to me. 

before she told me that, id never insulted her in my life. we dated for around 5 months. i never said a mean word to her once. but when i found out, all the words came pouring out.  

i still love her, i think. i dont want to. i dont want to love someone that can betray my trust so fucking bad like that. but another part of me does want to. she keeps telling me she still cares about me and that she still loves me. she's made that clear. i dont understand how someone that can do such an awful thing can even understand love. 

i loved her. i was going to leave my friends, family, my country, to be with her. we'd discussed weddings and kids and all that stuff because we liked to think about the future because we thought we were perfect for each other.   

and i would have done it too. i would have left everythjing behind for her. she was worth it. she was the first person i ever truly loved and i lost my virginity to her. i was the first person who cared for her since she has a long past of people being shitty to her. i cared for her so much. i helped with so much. i stopped her from hurting herself and committing suicide multiple times and i was always trying to help her with her confidence and her self esteem. 

she wants to keep talking to me and we've messaged each other since the call ended, with me saying both mean shit and sad shit. i dont know what to do. i know the standard /r/relationships thing is to delete everything of hers but its so fucking hard. i cant do it. i dont want to forget her. 

i've been typing for a while. i dont really know what to say anymore.  im broken. i feel like shit. i feel worthless. less than nothing. less than dirt. i dont know what to do with myself. ive got no one to talk to. no one. i'm alone now. every fucking night ill sit here by myself, alone, until god knows when.   

she told me it felt like we were losing momentum. god i hate her excuses for it. i hate her and i love her. i dont want to lose her. 

i dont know what to do. i dont want to say goodbye to her. i love her more than anything and its so painful. but she cheated on me and i'll never be able to trust her again. this is going to bring me back into depression. ",11Nov2017,0

Doing just enough to keep me slightly better in stature than others and using this self feeding loop for my inflated ego. The more I think about this the more I realize it is true. 'Intellectual': I hate that word. I know fuck all.

 I spent most of my teenage years in front of a computer screen reading 'interesting' things, leaving my social life in shambles. I get nervous around people. I don't like it when there are more than 3-4 people in the same room as me. I don't like talking to strangers. I frequently straight up ignore good friends and treat them as strangers I'm meeting for the first time. My appearance is mostly shabby. I don't buy new clothes very often. My parents would be right to be ashamed of me. So would my friends. After all, I  haven't spoken to any of my friends since the last time I saw them, a few years ago. Some of my current friends pity me and treat me as a harmless wierdo who they don't mind keeping company. Hardy was right. Most people can do nothing at all well. I am one of these people. I see no point in just drifting along doing the next thing that I am supposed to be doing to stay in the 'system'. I add no value to the world. I rarely call home.

Like somebody punched a hole in my chest and now it feels like something should be there, I almost feel something missing, but I don't feel anything at all. 

That is my natural state. I think it started with me being alone, and being alone all the time has led me to feel it even when I'm not alone. Now i'm always alone, even when I'm not. 

Sometimes it gets even worse. Sometimes, on my bad days, I feel an overwhelming sadness. Worthlessness and a numb feeling. So I spend all my free time trying to avoid that. I spend my time reading about people who aren't so alone. 

It helps me feel better I guess. 

The sadness makes it hard to deal with other people. Especially my family. I have a hard time coping on my own, so when they berate me for the smallest things, I lose my cool and go off on them for it. 

I don't like that I have very little patience. It's hard being sad and patient. My family thinks there's something very wrong with me. I stopped going to church out of a lack of belief and they think I'm possessed. I didn't realize until I moved my mattress and found it hiding a ridiculous amount of crosses and saints medallions.

I can't tell my family. They care not for me. I tried telling my sister, but she just laughed me off as someone who claims to have problems for attention, to be special. However, when I try to talk to her about our family, she just blames me for starting fights. I don't start anything. People berate me until I lose my cool so they can scream at someone and have them take the blame.

 I'm always the scapegoat in this house for the arguments. My family doesn't take me seriously. I tried telling them how I've felt. I told them they don't even listen to their only son. They simply said, ""We've listened, and your on an entirely different planet. we don't want to hear from you.""

My sadness comes out as very irritable and I feel like I'm a burden on everyone else. Today, I tried to cope with the sadness by playing piano for the first time in a year, and my brother came in and claimed I stole the car keys, knowing that I did not steal the car keys, and I told him to get out and he said I had ""anger issues"", knowing full well that saying that would piss me off, and I lost it and asked him why he would say that. My mother only told me I did, in fact, have anger issues.

It's hard to focus on my schoolwork (even though it's only a couple days a week) when all I can think about is paying my next round of bills.

45,"First of all. Holy shit how do you make friend? Like I always kinda thought I knew how, but it's been crazy hard recently. I'm currently in my senior year of college and I've had friends throughout but recently none since all my old friends have either graduated or I've cut ties with for interest of simply living a healthier life and becoming a better self. Now I have none. And I'm really struggling to make new friends... I'm incredibly nice, like I have rarely a bad word to say about anybody, but I do have some p gnarly social anxiety. That's not to say I'm not confident in myself, because I am. I know I'm actually a pretty great person, but I have a hard time dealing with large groups of people. So what do?",11Nov2017,2

47,"Title says it best, I dont feel comfortable imposing myself on others but I can't take the crushing loneliness. I really want a girlfriend or a normal friend circle but those seem far out of reach.

I can safely say though that in my entire teenage life from middle school up to college where I'm stuck now ive never recieved a single ioi from any girl. I personally think I look fine (a little scrawny but not unhealthy) but my opinion of myself doesnt really mean much when I'm invisible to half the population.

I've never been in the appropriate situation to ask a girl out before. All my female friends are in ltrs or have multiple other fwbs and like I said no girl ever flirts with me in day to day life (especially if I'm at a party or club and there are other hotter guys there). I have no problem conversing with people, being sociable or making jokes but there must be something wrong or inadequate about me since no guys respect me or want to be friends, and girls just act polite or ignore me.

I guess I probably qualify as a nice guy although I don't think I'm entitled to anything from women. I would ask out girl if I thought she wouldnt be receptive because i can imagine how much it must suck to be hit on by a loser guy you have no interest in and I dont want to make anyone's life any worse than it has to be. Maybe I'm too sensitive but it seems like most women get so much attention from people who are much more physically and socially attractive than me that I wouls just be a nuisance and they would be irritated if not offended if I dared to make any kind of move.

This has turned into kind of a rant and I'm sorry, I just hate that my life is 1/4 or more over and I haven't experienced any happiness, satisfaction or accomplishment , with women or in general.

I'm stuck in school studying a subject I hate because I'm not good enough at music to make a career out of it. I've grown to hate most of my hobbies but I still do them because theyre the only things I'm competent at. Every time I try to play sports or go to the gym I make a fool out of myself and feel like I want to die. I hate exercise and athletics so much but I still try because I know ill never be accepted by men or women otherwise, no girl wants someone who cant fight or play sports.

I spend all weekend alone in bed (since none of my friends invite me anywhere and I dont want to have to be that wierd guy that goes and does things alonr or joins new groups without bringing someone along) Maybe ill go to a coffee shop and play on my phone if I'm feeling bold.

I've missed so many developmental milestones my confidence is at an all time low. I hate being such a weak virgin loser but I can't seem to put myself through the pain needed to change. I hate my brain and body for not giving me the willpower to stand up for myself, or go to the gym and NGAF. I hate it that I freeze up in fear whenever someone I know is stronger than me walks by me, I hate that I feel like crying every time I talk to a pretty girl or guy who I know has lived a way more fulfilling life than me and has access to so many social opportunities that I would be thrown out or attacked if I tried to join. I hate being timid and inferior and hopeless.

I want to make a girl happy and I hate that because of how unnatractive my life is I can't do that. I suck value from any social situation I'm in because I'm inexperienced and desperate so I never want to be around people and bring down their good time. I wish I could just check out of society and just go live on an island for while. I want to be someone else but my brain wants me to stay as no-one. Does anyone have any advice or encouraging words. I feel like such a failure of a man for not being able to just force myself to exercise or ask out girls.

People have told me that since I'm 20 I have a lot of time left to change, but its taken a lot of dedication just to reach the mediocre place I am now, I dont know if I possess what I takes to change myself out of being such a loser no matter how much time I have. I know that just getting a gf won't make me 'happy', but I'm sure ill never be happy with my life if I have to go through it all alone.",11Nov2017,14
48,"Typically you don't see a lot of black women that are into these kinds of things and in the past I have been teased and kind of ostrizised (spell check) for the things I like. I only had a small group of friends that liked the same things I like and as I've gotten older those friends have moved on. So now I'm finding myself with no one to talk about anime, video games or even cartoons with.
