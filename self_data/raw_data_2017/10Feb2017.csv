0,"I’m a highly competitive person and I enjoy the thrill of games, especially those that involve strategy.  Playing is not all about winning to me, but winning certainly reaffirms that I played well and used solid strategy, and that makes the experience fun for me.  Above all else, what makes games fun for me is the challenge.  If a game is too easy or too chance based, I enjoy it far less.  I’m attempting to be honest here, but to err on the side of caution, please be critical of my side of the story.  

I’ve had a lot of problems lately with my girlfriend’s friend group.  They like to play certain board games and video games, but I’m at constant odds with them, especially one guy in the group.  I know a big part of the conflict is me, but at the same time, I used to have weekly board game nights with my friends at college, and we played video games every day without these issues.  It’s like my college friends shared my thrill of challenge and understood competiveness, so although there was occasional aggression, it never amounted to anything other than heated competition.

There are three examples that describe the issues I’ve had with my girlfriend’s friends really well.  First, a game of monopoly (which I know was asking for it, but it’s too late to undo it).  I had been dealt a mediocre streak of chance – I landed mostly on owned spaces while the board was empty, so I never established my place on the board.  And that was fine to me because I understand how games work and I get that a lot of your success is beyond your control.  Anyway, one of the girls in the group set up a trade, in which I had the best offer, and she chose to shut me down and then go for a lesser trade.  And then she did it again.  And then she convinced the other players not to trade with me.  Now I understand this strategy if I was a threat, but I was struggling as it was – I think I was only ahead of one person who was barely trying to involve herself in the game.  So I got upset and I voiced it, calling it unfair and rude or something of the sort.  After that, everybody got angry with me, and used the classic line “It’s just a game.”  The rest of the game became awkward, and I spent the rest of the night trying to defend myself against my girlfriend, who insisted that the girl was just playing the game and I care too much about winning.

The second situation involved Mario Party on more than one occasion (I know, I’m asking for petty squabbles).  This group is considerably inexperienced with videogames so they absolutely love Mario Party and never take me up on a game of Smash Bros. or Mario Kart or other beginner level games.  Anyway, nearly every time we play, the same girl I had a problem with in Monopoly always boasts about how well she’s doing.  She loses every minigame, but the Mario Party gods work their magic and she thinks she’s the shit.  And that’s stupid and equally stupid for me to get worked up about, but it lowers the enjoyment of the game for me.  Meanwhile, this one guy we play with laughs obnoxiously every time something bad happens to someone else or if he gets lucky.  I shouldn’t care, but it’s like every one of their overjoyed outbursts irritates me because somehow them being unjustly proud of themselves makes the game feel just as false for me.  I take joy out of tracking my minigame wins, and I’m pretty much always the minigame star winner, but let’s be real, it’s Mario Party and it isn’t that difficult to win against inexperienced gamers.  So while that occasionally makes up for the stupidity I feel like I go through playing with them, it usually just feels like a shallow victory.

The last situation, and this was the worst of the lot, was a game of Scrabble.  I thought it would be a calm game to play because I can’t remember any bickering between my family members – who tend to be competitive themselves.  We were nearing the middle/end of the game and the guy I described in the last situation was on his phone and then played some strange word.  Somebody else questioned it and he said that he double-checked online and confirmed it was a Scrabble accepted word.  Now, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and assumed he did not use one of those Scrabble solver sites or something like that, but out of curiosity, I asked him what it meant because I had absolutely no idea, and he responded that he had no clue but he looked it up and it came up in the dictionary.  So he, as far as I’m concerned, cheated, but in order to not create tension, I did the responsible thing and accepted it.  Anyway, as the next person went, I looked up the word and found it in a dictionary – it was a suffix, which is not allowed in Scrabble.  So I’m thinking, maybe there’s some obscure other meaning and instead I just searched it in a couple of those Scrabble checkers – none of them had a definition and all of them said it was NOT a Scrabble word.  So I calmly went, “Hey XXXXX, it’s fine cause we already played it, but I don’t think it’s an acceptable word, I can’t find it in any of these Scrabble checkers.” So this was obviously a mistake on my part, because I questioned him, even though I wasn’t trying to count it against him or anything like that, and he angrily pulled out his phone and showed me that the Scrabble finder he used said it was a word, and it popped up in the dictionary too.  So I tell him, nonchalantly, that I’m not sure why that site accepted it and the others didn’t and that the dictionary only had it as a suffix.  My sister was nearby – and mind you she is a quiet and polite person unlike myself – and she chimes in with a confirmation that suffixes aren’t allowed in Scrabble, so the guy shouted at her that it was on that Scrabble website.  He shouts a lot and his group of friends accept it as him just being loud and aggressive (in a positive way, don’t ask me to explain), so this was not out of the ordinary, but my sister was visibly uncomfortable and left the room a short time later.  The rest of the game was quiet and awkward and I watched quietly as literally every other player looked up words on their phones to clear out their final letters, playing words that didn’t even sound like English.  I ended up winning, but watching everybody cheat with their phones really sucked the joy out of an already sucky game.

Here comes the fun part.  My girlfriend became mad at me for causing conflict with the guy, who I have had game based drama with before.  But I was bewildered because I thought for sure that HE was the one acting out of line, because all I did was try to follow the rules of the game, and I did it with a calm voice as far as I can tell.  More importantly, a week or so goes by, and we are all at a diner when the girl (from situations one and two) brings up the Scrabble night, mentions my sister, and says “now we know where the [my last name] gaming complex comes from,” and as if I wasn’t already about to lose my shit over her blaming my honest to god innocent sister, the guy chimes in with something and I went off on him in a way I’ve never done before.  I yelled something to the effect of “I’m the one with the problem when you literally shouted at my incredibly polite sister over some bullshit” and it ended mid sentence because my girlfriend grabbed me and forced me to stop.

So here’s some of my own reflection.  My overreaction at the diner was just that – an overreaction.  I owned up to it and sent a long apology to the guy, but it has been nearly a full day and he has not responded (yet he told my girlfriend he read it).  My girlfriend is furious with me and is hardly talking to me.  I feel badly for acting out like I did, but I still feel like the tension leading up to this event was not entirely my own doing, but the group seems to blame me regardless while the guy is seen as the victim.  Understandable now that I had an outburst, but I still don’t understand how this was the case before I lost my cool.  Furthermore, I understand that I shouldn’t get mad over petty chest thumping during Mario Party, because it’s meaningless.  Lastly, I know I shouldn’t take something like Monopoly to heart, even when someone is singling me out and playing in an unsportsmanlike behavior.  My competitiveness and the seriousness I bring to the gaming table is one of my least favorable qualities (to myself, but I’m sure in the eyes of others as well, especially my girlfriend).

What has me in confusion is whether I’m underestimating how much I contribute to the problem, or if this group is particularly contentious with games and I just incite it.  When I played Catan with my friends at college, we would single out the leading player all the time (myself included) to prevent their victory, we all saw winning as an accomplishment (we even had a tally of the wins), and we had the occasional sourness but it was always mild and short lived.  In general, I would call it a very healthy and engaging experience, the direct opposite of the one I currently find myself in.

As a side note, the girl and guy I have problems with have reputations for being rude.  The girl has self-titled herself “the bitchy friend” and constantly says mean things about people to get attention.  The guy is a considerable gossiper too, and as I said he shouts constantly at people, which somehow generates laughs or praise for his “honesty.”  They are also at constant odds with each other, but she seems to enjoy it, while he gets mad, calls her rude, and talks behind her back.  I’m no angel myself, but I do avoid gossip, and I am certainly not proud of my abrasiveness.  Just trying to put some context behind these people.


***So if you’ve made it to the end of my post, here are my questions:

- Am I totally in the wrong like my girlfriend’s friends seem to think?
- How do I avoid feeling distraught over things like cheating, pettiness/boasting, and being teamed up on?
- How do I convince my girlfriend that it isn’t about winning to me (that I just enjoy the competition and fair play)?  AKA that this isn’t something as simple as me being a sore loser/winner or something
- How do I distinguish (to my girlfriend) between the times when her friends are playfully rude and when they are just mean and hurtful?  And do I have a right to be upset about them being constantly openly rude to me and others, even when they are doing it for laughs?
- Lastly, how do I repair my relationships with these people?  I doubt I’ll ever consider them trustworthy friends of my own, but I would, at the very least, like to enjoy their company.

tl;dr: I can’t get along with my girlfriend’s friends when we play games; I’m competitive; they’re rude from my perspective; how do I tolerate them and ease the tension?

3,"Not the most interesting update, but some have asked so here is an update.  

There has thus far been no further cop activity.  When I went out to get my mail yesterday my neighbor actually came out and stopped me to ask me if I knew what was going on.  She said, among other things, that she had no idea why the cops were wandering around, they knocked on her door three times (I hadn't seen them knocking, but I guess they did), she assumed her father would answer the door and so didn't get up to get it and didn't realize they were cops until she came out to turn out the porch light and saw the cars down the road.  She did not clarify why her father didn't answer the door.  I find her explanation sketchy, but hey, it's not my life.  At this point I'm assuming the cops are trying to serve some sort of warrent and they are trying to ignore it, but I didn't expound on this theory with her.  I have no idea what sort of warrent they would have, we've lived here ten years now and there's never been any issues, it's a pretty good neighborhood in a rural area of town and most everyone just keeps to themselves, so the whole thing is kind of odd.  Anyway, I don't think anything violent or dramatic is going to happen after all, I think the cops are just trying various times of day to serve them, decided to try late at night, and probably walked in hoping they'd open the door not expecting cops if they didn't see cop cars.  So there you have it.  If we end up with a swat team out here, I'll be sure to let you know.  :)",10Feb2017,3

7,"I hate being poor and constantly stressing about money. Yet, as a disabled adult (I have Asperger's Syndrome) who simply cannot earn enough to make ends meet, it seems like this is all I have to look forward to for the rest of my life. My parents are currently helping me to get by, and I'm really scared about what my life will be like once they can't help me out financially anymore. 

I never once chose to be born with Asperger's Syndrome, and if I had had a choice in the matter, you can bet that I would've chosen not to be born with it. It has made my life hell in so many ways, and the fact that I'm struggling with poverty is the tip of the iceberg. But having more money would make my life easier in so many ways, and it'd certainly make my parents' lives easier as well. But unfortunately, there are far too many Republicans in this country who have a mindset of ""screw everyone else, I've got mine."" And those Republicans are just making life worse for poor people like me. 

I'm becoming more and more disillusioned and frustrated with capitalism with each passing day. I hate the fact that my disability makes me incapable of doing the one thing that's necessary for me to live a happy life, namely working enough to not live in poverty. I do have a part-time work-from-home job, but that job doesn't give me enough of an income to live on. And, though I do keep applying for jobs, it seems like many employers see my Asperger's Syndrome as a liability once they can tell that I have it during the interview process. (I tend to [""stim""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimming) a lot during interviews, and that makes it pretty obvious that I'm on the autism spectrum.)

Why are so many Americans determined to keep screwing us poor people over? And why does it seem like compassion has become a thing of the past? I just don't get it.",10Feb2017,3

Dear John Wick,
	There I was.  On my knees. Fists pressed against my eyes.  Screaming every thought, half thought racing through head.  I hate you.  I hate you, you fucking piece of shit.  I trusted you, you fucking pig.  My heart exploded like fireworks, scattering burnt pieces of scorched flesh everywhere.  Man, I was so fucking hurt!  All those years together.  Committed.  Faithful.  Loyal.  Trusting.  You.  Two faced deceitful god of lies.  Trickster.  I couldn’t breathe.  An arsenal of staggering truth assaulted my mind.  Deep down, I knew I had survived trauma worse than this.  I had to have in order to cultivate  my disdainful, cavalier attitude towards men.  Anger and hurt surged through me.  I wanted to hit something.  Gut something.  Oh what I would give for a garrote!!!  Then I heard it.  The sound vibrated through me.  I felt like I was drenched in KY Yours+Mine.  The epiphany of the words hit me like a mind shattering orgasm.  I heard:

					KILL.  THEM.  ALL.

I stared at the TV screen.  Axis.  Bold as love.  John Wick.  With a simple solution to my dilemma.  Mesmerized, I watched you annihilate everything that stood in your way.  No matter how many assailants or where they appeared, you adjusted and expunged every threat.  You were new to me.  I had never seen you before.  You are a fifth force of nature.  Anyone calling the corners needs to call you as the phallic focal point of unbridled resolve.  You gave me my final solution.

Today, I am woman unbound.  And I have you, John Wick, to thank for my freedom.  Your steadfast dedication showed me that I can dictate my own denouement.  I’m not his victim anymore.  You taught me to slay my dragons and not look back.  I kicked the drug that kept me jonesing for years.  Whenever that vexing craving creeps into my mind (we lived a life together!  You know what that’s like.), I just repeat that mantra KTA.  Immediately, endorphins flood my body chemistry and I revel in the euphoria John Wick induces.

				I love you, John Wick!!!",10Feb2017,0
28,"The Democrat party agenda has been the dominate culture in mass media and society for the last 3 decades--and now more than ever. Award shows for the entertainment elite like the Oscars and the Golden Globes are pretty much Democrat party conventions these days, telling you to act and think a certain way. Today's society polices your thought and your words to conform to the Democrat party agenda; dissenting thought is condemned as immoral and often thought dissenters are seen as scum. Having a Trump sign in your yard invites your house to vandalism and sharing a pro-Trump meme could result in you getting fired from your job.
A counter culture movement is rising in today's youth, and it's conservative.

Today's 18 year-olds have lived with this culture their entire life and know nothing different. Young people are tech savvy and have lots of free-time, so of course they have a huge presence on the internet and gravitate to memes like Pepe.

31,"This happened a month or 2 ago, and I feel like sharing it. I was driving down a main street somewhere in LA, when the light 4 cars ahead of me started turning red. Right in front of me were some train tracks with the red warning blockers and the red lights that flash and warn when there is an incoming train, and past that there was no more room to move ahead because it was blocked off by a line of cars. The guy behind me starts honking, but I don't move, and he starts honking more persistently. This motherfucker wants me to move ahead into the path of some active train tracks, essentially trapping myself and at the mercy of an incoming train, just because he wants to move up several feet. It's a red light so he wouldn't be advancing any faster either way. He continues honking and when the light turns green, he floors it, goes from 0-100, and cuts me off aggressively. 


Some people are seriously fucking stupid. How can some people be so fucking inconsiderate? When this guy dies I want it to be by getting stuck on some train tracks. And in his final moments his final thoughts will be of that one time he was inconsiderate by not thinking of the safety of that stranger whom he essentially wanted to trap in some train tracks for his own selfish, personal benefit. Then it all goes black. Actually no, it doesn't end that easy.

So last year I started smoking regularly (once or twice a week) and this was in part a way to escape a episode of depression id been battling for a couple months. As many stories with regular drug use, I didn't stop at smoking. I went on to try opiates ,(Codeine, Hydrocodone, Dextromethorphan, 25i NBOMe, and i smoked a bowl with cocaine in it without my knowledge. The DXM was my most recent obsession as my depression was spiraling out of control. It was the ultimate escape for me, taking my consciousness out of the picture completely so I could look at everything objectively. I liked the way it made me feel, I was dependent on it. I stopped taking my antidepressants (Lexapro 10mg) because i didn't want to risk serotonin syndrome. I binged at school, work, home, anywhere I was I was constantly fucked up. I worried people constantly, but was too blind to see that my life extended beyond my own suffering. After heavy doses, (500-700mg) everyday for two weeks, I chose to do a 300mg dose after my father told me how worried he was for me. (I should probably mention that there was an overdose of a family friend not even a week prior to this incident). This trip starts off like any other, me acting absolutely retarded in my bed, hugging my dogs, and spacing out looking at my ceiling. I was deep in thought when all the sudden, everything changed. I felt content in ways i had never felt before in my life. I was no longer contemplating suicide. I was happy. This happiness extended past the high, me calling all my close friends and telling them the good news. I stayed off any substance for a good couple days before i inevitably went back to using again. This time I wasn't gonna let myself become dependent on it though. I lied to myself again, as how life works shit tended to hit the fan right as I was weak and trying to stop using. My girlfriend and I broke up, My parents found LSD I had purchased for my friends and I, and I was getting drug tested regularly. Shit was hitting the fan, but I was happy for some reason (while sober). I wasn't reverting back to being destructive toward myself or hurting myself. Then, not even two days ago I decided to try out some potent LSD. The experience showed me myself. Showed me that my parents have no more figured out in life than I do. It showed me the cause of my problems. Me, it has always been me. The reason I couldn't find a girl who was good for me? I was a mess, a skinny drug addict with a nasty personality and a terrible self image. If I wouldn't go for someone like that then what made me think that someone who was pretty, had good mental health, and funny would go for me? From this i have decided to lay back until I learn self control. Ill have one last trip with a good friend of mine (the tabs are already bought), and then i'm stopping any substance for a month at the shortest. This time i'm going to use to connect more with myself so then i can focus on improving myself to what my standard is. I have many goals in life, and while i'm not going to have a fun time without my only known escape, I will have people to fall back on. Thanks for reading ya'll give me some input if you've ever gotten your shit together or have been through something lime this.

44,"Eight months ago I moved in with roommates for my first time in two years. I figured it was a great way to acquaint myself with a new city I moved into, build up a good amount of money in my savings and help pay off my new car. I'll be honest and say I immediately regretted it within the first month of moving in.

One of my roommates is the messiest and loudest person I have ever lived with. He's always in the living room hogging both TV's (one for Netflix, one for whatever game he's playing). He leave dirty dishes in the sink and never does any of the chores unless explicitly asked. I hardly have any personal space at all with him in the apartment.

The other one, he's pretty cool and I was already familiar with him since we were roommate in college, but he has been going through some financial issues as of late which is making paying the bills more stressful.

Just four more months and I'll be back on my own again! I already began making a list of all the apartments in the area and pretty much have one picked out.

On the bright side, with having roommates I have grown my savings substantially and by the time I move out I will have over 40% of my car loan paid off in under a year! So my main goals for moving in with them is at least a success. ",10Feb2017,1
47,"Dear President Trump,

You killed it and for that, I must thank you.

Thank you for completely annihilating the ancient regime of which you have long been a part. The age of old rich white men being in power is on its way out for good and it's largely in thanks to you. Whether you do so unwittingly, subconsciously or purely by accident is unknown and doesn't really matter because the regime is dead no matter which way you look at it. You awoke a righteous beast that has been simmering underneath the surface of this country for a very long time. People, especially women and minorities, are now standing up for the equality of just about everyone except those who are a part of the regime you just slaughtered and we have the technology to do so better and faster than ever before. Our numbers now outweigh your numbers and your campaign and presidency thus far have lit a fire under our collective ass. Thank you for being the figurehead we all needed to rally against. 

Thank you for instilling in us a new passion for legislation and the law. We are becoming more and more politically aware and our voices are so loud that politicians are literally turning around and running away rather than facing their own constituents. We're paying attention like never before and watching you and your colleagues closer than you can even imagine. We're making so many phone calls that local offices don't even have the time to check their voicemails and we're clogging the system in ways that even your empty Cabinet can't congest. We're going to remember everything we're seeing and feeling outraged about when the next election cycle rolls around and we will show you how a true democracy works. Thank you for making us feel angry and empowered enough to change our government.

Thank you for being so obsessed with Twitter because your scant knowledge of social media and the Constitution provides us with incriminating tweets that we can and will use to our advantage. It's also somewhat entertaining (albeit in a very distressing way) to read the dumpster-fires you create that your staff is constantly trying to put out. We have technology that enables us to research the things you say as quickly as you say them and your doublespeak will not work on us. Thank you for allowing us to watch you burn.

Thank you for demeaning and insulting women because they and their allies have created a movement unlike any other. And if you really want to impact the sales of your daughter's brand, continue to do what you've been doing because those of us you've outraged will continue to show you how we feel with our wallets. Guess who stereotypically really loves to shop? Women and gay men. Thank you for giving us this simple yet effective way of pissing you off.

Thank you for railing against the press and news outlets and all but telling us that the only statements we can actually trust are those that come out of your mouth. Anyone with half a brain cell should find that illogical and insulting and printed publications are now seeing an increase in paid membership for the first time in years. Serious journalism is once again in demand. Thank you for giving mouth-to-mouth to what was, until recently, considered a dying profession.

Thank you for bringing such a large group of us together. The fact that we're organizing against a common threat, namely you and your presidency, is almost a byproduct of the other things we're coming together for. We all want a clean planet for our children and grandchildren to live on. We all want decent paying jobs so we can have an adequate quality of life. We all want to avoid going into bankruptcy because of medical care costs. We all want equality in the workplace and the rest of the world. We all want peace and prosperity and we used to think those things were standard parts of the American Dream. Thank you for showing all of us that you and your administration think otherwise because now we all know exactly who the bad guys are. If there's one thing we have learned through this, it's that we will never have another presidency like yours ever again. 

Thank you for that and thank you for making this revolution possible. 

Love,
The Majority",10Feb2017,4

52,"When I was much younger I had a mentor who helped me in a technical capacity, and it was an amazing time for my personal development

Right now I'm 27, and I'm very lost with respect to what I want in my life, my ambitions, relationships and then some because I'm feeling very stagnant in life. 

I'm sorely missing a stable adult role model who can nonjudgementally guide me. My parents are not those people and they don't have very many friends - and those people are too close. 

My extended family is either distanced or estranged, and I'm not in university for my professors or older students.  

Thought I might reach out to reddit. 

Would anyone offer some pointers please?

I don't place that much weight in age - so if anyone feels they could be a mentor even if they were similar in age I would welcome it. 

Thanks

54,"God forbid I actually call him a communist however, he prefers the title ""anarcho-communist."" We live in college housing, share an apartment (not a room, thank god) and he takes every chance he can get to push his ideology in my face, whether that be enticing an argument or showing me a meme.

He's hung two flags in the living room, one being the anarcho-communist flag and the other being a flag for Antifa International. He constantly participates in black bloc activities downtown.

Did I mention he's never worked a day in his life? He's a 2nd year here at college, came straight from high-school. He also never cleans up after himself, doesn't keep up his weight in chores either.

I've tried to speak up against him. I've debated him before, the problem is it always ends the same way, him using bullying tactics to make me feel lower and lower. I've been dealing with depression for awhile, so that doesn't help.

I also can't say anything. The general mindset here at this campus is in support of ideologues such as him. I've had to confine myself and all of my belongings to my room. Luckily I work for housing so when I'm not holed up in my room, I'm somewhere else working.

I know this was badly written. I'm really bad a talking about my feelings, and at the moment I feel pressured to stay out of his way, and I hate that. I can't enjoy this apartment like I thought I could, instead I have to flee and stay in my room. Sometimes I can't even do that, he comes knocking on my door.",10Feb2017,3

And I just absolutely couldn't eat it, even though the actual quality itself was good. Later, after I came back home, I asked my parents if they liked poppy seeds, and they said that ""We LOVE it!"" Baffled, I googled for any answers or similar opinions to my own, but literally nobody seems to hate it. Anyoooone? :( To me, poppy seeds taste like dirt, even the fresh ones. ",10Feb2017,1
61,"So someone found this cure for cancer on the internet and decided to tell me about it thinking that they are helping me by doing that. While I understand and respect their intention, it had an entirely unexpected effect on me that they couldn’t have predicted.
Looking at those alleged 'cures', I began to doubt the treatment that I was getting. I began to ask if I was really getting the best treatment. Usually, I would deal with doubt pretty ruthlessly, but this time it somehow took hold. And what followed was stress. Oh gosh, stress and the whole truckload of scary things that it brings.
After a day of misery I finally got a grip on myself and decided to research these miraculous cures. And guess what, as my instinct had told me in the first place, these were snake oils of the finest kind.
As of at the time of writing this it's been a few days and I am still dealing with the stress, trying hard to banish it. 
This is what I have learnt from this experience. If I am going to offer someone a medical advice with a disease as serious as mine, the onus is squarely on me to make sure that I know what I am talking about, and that what I am going to suggest will not crumble at a cursory examination.
My research also showed me that the elaborate snake oil industry built around 'curing' tumours and cancer is humongous, it's scary. Taking advantage of patient's doubts to get them off proven treatments and sell them shoddy cures is just downright evil. But lots of people still seem to go for it because these snake oil salesmen work on their fears. Raise fears about the big bad 'big pharma' and people will run to grab your snake oil.

That's how my roommates are.

They are literally on the brink of failing their classes. They don't go to recitation and they don't go to office hours. Then they ask me for help, and it always takes so long to explain anything to them because they never go to class.

I missed class today for the first time and they gave me shit for it. Out of 15 classes so far,  this was the second one they went to. I wish this didn't bother me as much as does right now.",10Feb2017,5
