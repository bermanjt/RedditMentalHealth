6,"There is a fine levied against individuals that go 3+ months without insurance.  This is to ensure people don't only get insurance when they have discovered they need it.

Fine, I can accept that, so much so, that I paid 3 months fine last year.   Here is my flipside.  

If you are a company providing health insurance in America, to Americans, you must offer at least one plan on the exchange.  Failure to do so will result in fines to the insurance company.  The more plans they offer, and the better those plans for the consumer, the less annual fee your company pays.  So much so, that if you offer really affordable and beneficial plans, you can actually gain tax credits from the government.  It only makes sense to me, if the money collected in fines from individuals and other insurance companies, as well as any budgeted funds written into the bill were designed to help poor people afford insurance.  Insurance companies would be saving the government and customers money they would be taxing the fund less and being doing a service worthy of some credits.",28Jun2017,1
7,"I am in my late 20s and my friend is in his mid 20s. We have engineering classes together.I wouldn’t say we are best friends but we do like to go to bars and hit on girls on weekends. We started doing that since last fall semester. Lately for the past 2 months or so he started not texting back sometimes weeks at a time. I know people have their own lives and he does work too. But I tend to find it almost disrespectful whenever someone doesn't reply back to my messages. Especially if I asked that person a question. For example, two weeks ago I texted him to see if he wanted to hang out or what his plans were for the weekend. He texted me back last night “hey man, long time no talk, what are you up to tonight?” Here I am thinking to myself, wtf why does he think it’s cool to ignore my texts weeks at a time and randomly text me out of no where. My point is that whenever people I consider friends do taht to me, I tend to get a bit depressed because I do enjoy their company and have lots of fun hanging out with them. I get kind of upset that they do that and then start debating if they actually care about my friendship. Then when I resolve that I will stop talking to such person, then they text me. 


What is your take on this? How do you handle these mini drama situations? Should I just stop talking to him and find other friends or keep talking to him? Sorry for the long rant, I had to let it out of my system. Thanks a lot.


  TLDR: I get upset and sad whenever friends ignore my texts for weeks and it makes me wonder if they don’t care about my friendship. Then suddenly they text me as if nothing had happened. What would you do? Stop talking, move on and give them another chance?",28Jun2017,3
8,I just can't do this. I'm too weak. I just want to be put out of my misery. There is something wrong with every part of my body. Every day I get more stupid. I need to die.,28Jun2017,2
10,"and then all of a sudden I just feel.. not right. Like I don't really belong wherever I am. I get in a funk for the rest of the day, and it's shitty because I can't really figure out what it was that triggered the sadness, emptiness, loneliness, whatever the fuck it is. Honestly, I'm not entirely certain how I feel; ""not right"" seems the most vague, but accurate.

It's not that I don't have much reason to be unhappy; usually I'm around people, sometimes friends. But it's always when I'm feeling good that something manages to come around and drag my day back down. I haven't been diagnosed with anything, and as far as I know, I don't ""have"" anything. But this has been on my mind for the past... six or seven months, I want to say. Things can change, I know, but it's starting to feel like they won't. I think I've been having these episodes longer than I've really taken note of them, but I don't really know.

Anyways, it's 12:47 AM where I am and I should probably sleep. I had some Nice! brand jalapeño peanut mix and a Mountain Dew Black Label for dinner, and I've been awake for 18 hours or so. Gonna try and go to bed now, but I have to be awake in like six hours.

Wasn't sure where else to put this. If this is the wrong place to put this, I greatly apologize.

(Parents, if you manage to find this, I'm sorry for not telling you any of this. I just found this easier than talking to you for whatever reason, and I don't want to blame you. You're nice people, and you shouldn't feel bad. It's me. Sorry.)",28Jun2017,2
14,"I'm a 16 year old student who has 5 more weeks of summer, (going into Junior year) and I've decided that I want to start my AP summer assignments. I started working on AP Psychology in which my teacher requires me to take notes from a textbook and complete 8 Textbook ""Modules"" that make up two Unit Chapters

The problem is, I'm a perfectionist. 

Each module, according to my teacher, should take about 2 hours each. 1/3 into the module reading/note taking, and I realize it's been an hour when it should've taken 30-ish minutes 

I read a section, then re-read the section while taking notes

After looking over my notes, I noticed some of it was just a regurgitation of the textbook, lengthly and meticulous. I felt ashamed of my tendency 

This is not a new thing. All of last year, I had classes I could not keep up with because of my attention to detail, over abundance of it. 

How do I get done with my work faster so I can take  2 hours on a section instead of 4? How do I shorten my notes so as to cut the time down? Does anyone have some useful tips to help me out?

Over the last day, I've looked to find a way to fix my habits. The answer to this question is very hard to find, although I am willing to listen ",28Jun2017,4

17,"""If the building crumbles down in front of me I would die crushed"" - I know that and still this cynism, procrastination and indifference will remain there and I need the change, I am tired of this. THERE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS I NEED TO GET MY HANDS ON OR ELSE I WILL BE IN FUCKING TROUBLE. 

Assembling and locking, emotionally, very good at it, infatuation - internal - REEEEEE - Only god knows how difficult it is to transmit, to transfer this energy into facts, solid and physical facts. 

Finding the idea of bricks and building awesome and yet not touching it, not going to the construction site of my own soul - Pitiful. 

""Everything is to be built, take it as an opportunity"" my helper says, but DO YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS? I am not blaming her though, she just states what is a fact. 

I believe in the silent movement of the invisible systems, they function within structures of breathtaking size across life. 

The invisible systems start in my head and finish in my head, along with the execution of the program of my sentience - DEATH will end it all, and my course of actions will reflect what my will shall have accomplished 

Is everything about will?

I believe it is

I am not a sad person, I am just learning, recently, after 27 years of coming to this world, that I had an interior and personal patrimony that I had been neglecting and avoiding 

Course of actions - a tiny fiber crushed between massive stone walls frapping repeatedly

Reddit - read it - read - it 

IT can be awesome or a huge pile of crap. You..decide? I don't think so. 

Sometimes I wonder if I actually have a peace of mind that allows me to be categorised as a normal and functional person. I have traumas like anyone else, mine are particular, well at least I like to say to myself that they are, I  attribute my difficulties to them but the root of the whole thing must be deeper. Oh I know, my helper seemed to approach things holistically

Pfff... this attempt seems to go nowhere, even for myself. What does it take to understand that the exit to this cage lies in some other corner? How do I grab the bull by the horns? How do I accept every challenge and overcome them? Because I know I have what it takes to go further. I am meant to do something nice for myself, hell I deserve it! I deserve a lot and I owe myself a lot! Helper, or brain, get to the solution quickly, the building is not crumbling down yet but in a couple of weeks I should have reinforced the whole structure so it doesn't come down.

20,"I'm a 22 year old guy. To keep this from being a longwinded rant I'll just say that, growing up, I was a very antisocial kid and always got moved around from school to school because of my behavior. I never made actual friends in high school or community college. I tried looking into college clubs but nothing seemed like it would remotely interest me. Anyway, I'm going to university in the fall, so hopefully I will be able to insert myself in more social situations then (I currently live at home and drive to school). 

I guess part of my problem is that I was the fat outcast kid for most of my life. I made all my 'friends' online playing video games, who were all either hundreds of miles away, decades older, or both. I just recently had a falling out with the last of these people and now I find myself completely 'friendless' ... but I always have been, haven't I? I mean, it's stupid to call people you've never physically met your friend. But I feel that's what I was forced into by my situation.

I lost the weight, and when I posted my progress on another sub I was told I was very attractive. I'm not saying this to humblebrag but rather to ask ... what do I do with that beyond just talk to people? Say hi and make small talk? In my community college classes, this never led anywhere, although I guess I could have asked to meet up and study with people outside of school. But that just feels ... fake.

35,"I am an extremely socially awkward person. People always have a harsh reaction towards my character when in a conversation with me. What makes me socially awkward is my social anxiety and lack of conidence. I become noticeably nervous or anxious when in conversation which makes me act a bit unusual. What really bothers me about this is the harsh reactions people have about these mannerisms of mine. People seem to get terrified of me and break down in social anxiety themselves when talking to me. This type of reaction is only unique to me because when I see those same people interacting with others they are doing perfectly fine. But with me, they react as if I am a notorious serial killer or something. I was wondering if this is a normal reaction from others towards my social awkwardness? Do you guys react in the same manner when conversating with somebody who is socially awkward? To describe my social awkwardness in more detail, I stutter and mumble, my voice may become shakey, I may freeze up when it's my turn to speak, and I can't stay still since I am overcome with nervousness.

41,"I've known this guy since elementary school. We went through elementary, middle, and high school together.  We became really close friends in high school, and even closer senior year. During senior year we had a thing together, but then I found out that there was this other girl. She went to our school the year before, but then had to move out of the country. She was a really close family friend to the guy I had a thing with.  Through out senior year he would go back and forth between saying he wanted to be with me but then another day wanted to be with her, and eventually he picked her.  During this entire time, he told me how much he loved her, that he wanted to marry her, move off to the other country with her, and have kids with her. Eventually I had enough so we stopped talking and each went off to our own college.  We started talking again towards the end of 1st semester of college, and he came to visit me at my college one day over thanksgiving break. We got a little too drunk and, while we were kissing, he ended up calling me the name of the girl that he picked me over.  I forgave him after a couple of weeks thinking about it, and then we saw each other again at Christmas break. We spent almost every day together over that break and he told me that he wanted me to be his first and that he loved me.  Later I found out that he was still calling that other girl every night and saying he loved her (which he says he only loved her as a friend). I forgave him once again and we started dating (in January) and have been ever since. However, he continued to talk to that other girl until about two months ago. I really struggle to forgive him and move on with our relationship, but he tells me he loves me more than he ever loved her and I know that I love him so much and think we are meant to be together. That love is the only thing that has kept me around. My question is, how have you Redditers made it through past history with your SO's? And do you have any suggestions for how I could get over this terrible situation? ",28Jun2017,1
